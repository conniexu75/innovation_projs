https://openalex.org/W1542263802,"Important Ca2+ signals in the cytosol and organelles are often extremely localized and hard to measure. To overcome this problem we have constructed new fluorescent indicators for Ca2+ that are genetically encoded without cofactors and are targetable to specific intracellular locations. We have dubbed these fluorescent indicators 'cameleons'. They consist of tandem fusions of a blue- or cyan-emitting mutant of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), calmodulin, the calmodulin-binding peptide M13, and an enhanced green- or yellow-emitting GFP. Binding of Ca2+ makes calmodulin wrap around the M13 domain, increasing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the flanking GFPs. Calmodulin mutations can tune the Ca2+ affinities to measure free Ca2+ concentrations in the range 10(-8) to 10(-2) M. We have visualized free Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol, nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum of single HeLa cells transfected with complementary DNAs encoding chimaeras bearing appropriate localization signals. Ca2+ concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum of individual cells ranged from 60 to 400 microM at rest, and 1 to 50 microM after Ca2+ mobilization. FRET is also an indicator of the reversible intermolecular association of cyan-GFP-labelled calmodulin with yellow-GFP-labelled M13. Thus FRET between GFP mutants can monitor localized Ca2+ signals and protein heterodimerization in individual live cells."

The HIF-1 complex is composed of two protein subunits: HIF-1β/ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator), which is constitutively expressed, and HIF-1α, which is not present in normal cells but induced under hypoxic conditions. The HIF-1α subunit is continuously synthesized and degraded under normoxic conditions, while it accumulates rapidly following exposure to low oxygen tensions. The involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the proteolytic destruction of HIF-1 in normoxia was studied by the use of specific inhibitors of the proteasome system. Lactacystin and MG-132 were found to protect the degradation of the HIF-1 complex in cells transferred from hypoxia to normoxia. The same inhibitors were able to induce HIF-1 complex formation when added to normoxic cells. Final confirmation of the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the regulated degradation of HIF-1α was obtained by the use ofts20TG R cells, which contain a temperature-sensitive mutant of E1, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Exposure of ts20 cells, under normoxic conditions, to the non-permissive temperature induced a rapid and progressive accumulation of HIF-1. The effect of proteasome inhibitors on the normoxic induction of HIF-1 binding activity was mimicked by the thiol reducing agentN-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine and by the oxygen radical scavenger 2-acetamidoacrylic acid. Furthermore,N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine induced gene expression as measured by the stimulation of a HIF-1-luciferase expression vector and by the induction of erythropoietin mRNA in normoxic Hep 3B cells. These last findings strongly suggest that the hypoxia induced changes in HIF-1α stability and subsequent gene activation are mediated by redox-induced changes.

Mammalian cells are able to sense oxygen tension and turn on a series of genes in response to the lack of oxygen. The best characterized of these hypoxia-regulated genes is the one coding for erythropoietin (Epo), 1The abbreviations used are: Epo, erythropoietin; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; NMPG, N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine; PAS, PER-ARNT-SIM; Ac, acetyl; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; E1, Ub-activating enzyme.1The abbreviations used are: Epo, erythropoietin; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; NMPG, N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine; PAS, PER-ARNT-SIM; Ac, acetyl; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; E1, Ub-activating enzyme. the growth factor that regulates red cell production (reviewed in Ref. 1Ratcliffe P.J.

The hypoxia response of the Epo gene is controlled by an enhancer element located in the 3′-flanking region of the gene (2Beck I. Ramirez S. Weinmann R. Caro J. J. Biol.

Transcriptional activation of the enhancer is mediated by a hypoxia-inducible DNA-binding protein complex termed HIF-1, which binds to the site-1 sequences of the enhancer (5Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar, 6Beck I. Weinmann R. Caro J. Blood. 1993; 82: 704-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar enhancer elements, also involving the binding of HIF-1, have been identified in other hypoxia-responsive genes, such as those coding for vascular endothelial growth factor (7Levy A.P.

All these genes also respond like Epo, to cobalt ions and iron chelators, suggesting a common mechanism for oxygen sensing and gene activation. The recent cloning of the protein components of the HIF-1 complex identified two subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-1β, which belong to the subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors containing a PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) motif (11Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4995) Google Scholar). The HIF-1α subunit is a new member of the family, whereas HIF-1β corresponds to the known aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) protein. Hypoxia induces the formation of HIF-1 complex by a process that requires protein synthesis (5Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which cells sense the lack of oxygen and initiate the hypoxic response are currently unknown. However, significant indirect evidence suggests that redox-mediated processes are likely involved in this step. Treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide greatly reduces HIF-1 formation and Epo mRNA expression in response to hypoxic stimulation (12Fandrey J. Frede S. Jelkmann W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Semenza G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Since oxygen radicals and superoxide formation are very dependent on oxygen availability, their reduced formation under hypoxic conditions could serve as the initial signal in oxygen sensing. Of the components of the HIF-1 complex, ARNT protein is constitutively expressed in all cells while HIF-1α is present only in hypoxic cells. Thus, HIF-1 complex formation appears to be determined primarily by the abundance of the HIF-1α subunit. The observation that hypoxia does not modify HIF-1α mRNA levels suggested that HIF-1α protein content is regulated at the level of its mRNA translation or by changes in its rate of degradation (14Salceda S. Beck I. Caro J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, Huang et al. (15Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) recently reported that HIF-1α protein is highly unstable under normoxic conditions and that hypoxia significantly prolonged its half-life, thus allowing its accumulation and the formation of the complex. The mechanisms involved in the rapid degradation of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions and the signals involved in the stabilization process by hypoxia, are currently unknown. The results presented here indicate that the rapid degradation of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and its stabilization is probably induced by redox-mediated changes. Hep 3B and B-1 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Hep 3B cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. The B-1 cell line is a Hep 3B-derived cell line which was stably transfected with an expression vector containing luciferase cDNA under the control of a minimal Epo promoter (330-base pair SfaNI-XbaIII fragment) and the hypoxia responsive enhancer from the human Epo gene (150-base pair ApaI/PstI fragment). The response of these cells to hypoxia, cobalt, and desferrioxamine has been reported (16Salceda S. Beck I. Srinivas V. Caro J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 556-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For hypoxic stimulation cells were flushed with a gas mixture containing 0.5% O2, 5% CO2 and balanced N2 as already described (2Beck I. Ramirez S. Weinmann R. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15563-15566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The BALB/c 3T3 andts20TG R (17Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) cell lines were provided by Dr. Harvey L. Ozer, Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, UMDNJ, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey. Both cell lines were maintained at 35 °C in a humidified incubator with 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics as described above. The permissive and non-permissive temperatures for the ts20TG R mutant cell line are 35 and 39 °C, respectively. For inhibitor experiments, calpain inhibitors I and II (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA) were dissolved in ethanol. MG-132 (Peptides International, Inc., Knoxville, KY), E-64d (Sigma), interleukin-1β-converting enzyme inhibitor II (BACHEM Bioscience, Inc., King of Prussia, PA), and lactacystin (provided by Dr. S. Ōmura from The Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan) (18Ōmura S. Fujimoto T. Otoguro K. Matsuzaki K. Moriguchi R. Tanaka H. Sasaki Y. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 44: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Control cells were untreated or treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or ethanol. No differences in binding activity were found among these samples. Catalase, AD-1, and NMPG were from Sigma. Nuclear extracts were prepared from normal or treated cells as described previously (14Salceda S. Beck I. Caro J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed by incubating 7 μg of nuclear extract with32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe as described previously (6Beck I. Weinmann R. Caro J. Blood. 1993; 82: 704-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For supershift assays, 1 μl of polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbits against recombinant HIF-1α or ARNT (1:5 dilution) were added to the nuclear extracts and incubated for 2 h on ice prior to adding labeled probe. Antibodies were kindly provided by Drs. G. L. Semenza (The Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland) and C. A. Bradfield (Department of Oncology, Medical School, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin). A normal rabbit serum (preimmune) served as a negative antibody control. All cell extracts were prepared and analyzed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 35-mm plates were washed twice with cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and 100 μl of 1 × lysis buffer was then added to the cells. Samples were collected and 5-μl aliquots were assayed using luciferase assay reagent. Luminescence was measured in a TD 20/20 luminometer (Promega), and results expressed as relative light units per μg of total protein. Protein concentrations were determined by a commercial kit (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Total RNA was extracted by utilizing the guanidine thiocyanate-phenol method as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). For Northern blots, 20 μg of total RNA was separated in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Life Science Inc.), and cross-linked by ultraviolet light. Membranes were prehybridized in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham) at 65 °C. Hybridization was performed in the same prehybridization solution containing 1 × 106cpm/ml of radiolabeled probe at the same temperature. Membranes were washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and once with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C followed by exposure to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham). Erythropoietin probe was obtained from a human cDNA as already described (4Pugh C.W. Tan C.C. Jones R.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10553-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and labeled with 32P using a nick translation kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Studies by Wang et al. (11Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4995) Google Scholar) had shown that following discontinuation of hypoxia there is a rapid decay of HIF-1α protein and HIF-1 complex with a half-life of 5–10 min. To study the role of proteolytic degradation in this rapid decay we utilized a series of protease inhibitors with different enzyme specificities. Nuclear extracts were obtained from Hep 3B cells stimulated with hypoxia (0.5% O2) for 4 h and then transferred to normoxia for an additional 30 min. Protease inhibitors were added during the last 15 min of the hypoxic period (except for lactacystin that it was added 1 h before ending the hypoxia) and continued while in normoxia. As shown in the gel shift assays in Fig.1 A, transfer from hypoxia to normoxia produced a rapid decay of the HIF-1 complex which was undetectable by the end of the 30 min in normoxia. Addition of the peptides N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (calpain inhibitor I) and, to a much lesser extent, N-Ac-Leu-Leu-normethioninal (calpain inhibitor II) prevented this decay, whereas leupeptin, a lysosome inhibitor, and E-64d, a highly specific cysteine protease inhibitor, had no effect. The change from hypoxia to normoxia and the addition of inhibitors had no effect on the expression of SP1 binding activity (Fig. 1 B). The protective effect of calpain inhibitor I, which also has activity against the proteasome, and the lack of effect of E-64d suggested that the ubiquitin-proteasome system was likely involved in HIF-1 degradation. The participation of the proteasome was confirmed using the proteasome-specific inhibitors lactacystin, and the peptide Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H (MG-132), as shown in Fig.2. Also shown in this figure is the lack of effect of the peptide Ac-Tyr-Val-Al-Asp-CMK, an inhibitor of interleukin 1β-converting enzyme proteases.Figure 2Effect of proteasome inhibitors on HIF-1 binding after discontinuation of hypoxia.

We tested whether these inhibitors could also induce the formation of HIF-1 complex in normoxic cells. For this purpose Hep 3B cells were incubated under normoxic conditions for 6 h in the presence of protease inhibitors and their nuclear extracts assayed for HIF-1 activity by gel shift assays. As shown in Fig.3 A, calpain inhibitor I, and to a lesser extent calpain inhibitor II, lactacystin, and MG 132, stimulated the formation of HIF-1 complex in normoxic cells, whereas leupeptin and E-64d had no effect (not shown). Again, these agents had no effect on SP1 (Fig. 3 B). Confirmation of the presence of HIF-1α and ARNT proteins in the induced complexes was obtained by supershift assays utilizing specific antibodies against both protein subunits, as shown in Fig. 3 C. Furthermore, Western blot analysis using anti-Gal-4 antibodies showed that lactacystin increased the level of Gal-4/HIF-1α fusion proteins in transfected normoxic cells. 2V. Srinivas and J. Caro, unpublished data. The role of redox changes in HIF-1 induction was studied in normoxic Hep 3B cells exposed to the thiol-reductive agentN-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine (NMPG). As shown in Fig.3 A, lane 7, treatment of cells with 10 mm NMPG for 6 h induced HIF-1 complex, while no effect was observed in SP1. A possible effect of NMPG on the proteasome system was ruled out by the finding that NMPG did not affect the expression of p53 protein, whereas the proteasome inhibitors induced it (not shown). Supershifts shown in Fig. 3 C confirmed the presence of HIF-1α and ARNT in the complex. To evaluate the effect of NMPG on gene activation we utilized a Hep 3B-derived cell line (B-1) stably transfected with a luciferase expression vector containing a minimal Epo promoter and a HIF-1-binding site. These cells have been shown to respond to hypoxia by increasing luciferase expression in a time-dependent manner (16Salceda S. Beck I. Srinivas V. Caro J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 556-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Exposure of B-1 cells to various concentrations of NMPG for 18 h showed a dose-dependent stimulation of luciferase expression, as shown in Fig.4 A. Similar results were found when the oxygen radical scavenger 2-acetamidoacrylic acid (AD-1) was used (Fig. 4 B). A comparative effect between NMPG and hypoxia is shown in Fig. 4 C, where B-1 cells were exposed to either NMPG at 10 mm or 0.5% O2 for 6 h. The stimulatory effect of NMPG was also mimicked by the addition of catalase, which dismutates H2O2 into water and molecular oxygen, thereby decreasing its oxidative potential. Further confirmation of the stimulatory effect of NMPG on gene expression was obtained by Northern blot analysis of RNA obtained from normoxic Hep 3B cells treated with NMPG for 6 h, as shown in Fig. 4 D. Interestingly, the proteasome inhibitors did not stimulate Epo production. No changes in HIF-1α mRNA levels were found in untreated or hypoxia, proteasome inhibitors, and NMPG-treated Hep 3B cells (not shown). Polyubiquitination of proteins is the first step in the degradation of proteins by the proteasome system. Ubiquitin, a small basic protein of 76 amino acids found in all eukaryotic cells, can be covalently linked to proteins in an ATP-dependent process. Ub-activating enzyme (E1) catalyzes this first step, resulting in the formation of an E1-bound ubiquitin adenylate. To further confirm the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome in the proteolytic degradation of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions we utilized a BALB/c 3T3-derived cell line,ts20, containing a temperature-sensitive mutant of E1 (17Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Cells cultured under the permissive temperature (35 °C) maintain a functional ubiquitination pathway, whereas the shift to the non-permissive temperature (39 °C) inactivates ubiquitination. For these experiments, ts20 cells were cultured under normoxic conditions at 35 and 39 °C for 6 and 20 h and nuclear extracts were obtained and evaluated for HIF-1 complex formation by gel shift assays. As shown in Fig. 5 A,ts20 cells at 35 °C do not express HIF-1, whereas the shift to the non-permissive temperature causes a progressive accumulation of the complex. No effects were observed on SP1 binding activity. Supershift assays against HIF-1α and ARNT (Fig.5 B) confirmed the identity of the complex as HIF-1. Similar experiments conducted with the parental 3T3 cell line showed no induction of HIF-1 with the temperature shifts (not shown). Hypoxia responses of the Epo and other genes are mediated by the binding of a hypoxia-inducible complex (HIF-1) to a hypoxia-responsive enhancer. This process requires ongoing protein synthesis (5Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar) and is also dependent on some as yet undetermined phosphorylation step, since it is abolished by several kinase inhibitors (16Salceda S. Beck I. Srinivas V. Caro J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 556-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Semenza G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The protein components of this complex were recently cloned and characterized as belonging to the PAS family of the basic helix-loop-helix group of transcription factors (11Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4995) Google Scholar). One of the protein components, HIF-1β, is the already known ARNT, the dimerization partner of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor protein. ARNT protein is constitutively expressed in normal cells and its level is not affected by hypoxic conditions. On the contrary, the other component, HIF-1α, a new member of that family, is not expressed in normoxic cells, but accumulates rapidly under hypoxic conditions. Since HIF-1α mRNA is constitutively present in normoxic cells, the lack of HIF-1α protein is the consequence of either a lack of translation of the mRNA or the result of a rapid degradation of the protein. A recent report by Huanget al. (15Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) indicates that the half-life of the HIF-1α protein is extremely short in normoxic conditions and is markedly prolonged during hypoxic stimulation. The mechanisms responsible for the rapid degradation of the protein were not known. Control of gene expression by regulated proteolysis of transcription factors has been recently described to be an important and frequent mechanism of regulating gene transcription (reviewed in Ref. 21Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although all transcription factors are eventually degraded as part of the natural turnover of proteins, the stability of some factors is exquisitely controlled. This type of control can operate at a very rapid rate and has the advantage, over other post-translational modifications, of its irreversible nature. Eukaryotic cells depend mainly on the lysosome and the proteasome systems for the degradation of intracellular proteins. Proteins destined for proteasomal degradation are usually modified by the addition of multiple copies of ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid basic polypeptide, to specific lysine residues (reviewed in Ref. 22Hilt W. Wolf D.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination process requires several enzymatic steps, the first one utilizing E1, an activating enzyme that produces a high energy thiol ester intermediate. To study the role of regulated proteolysis in the regulation of HIF-1α, we utilized initially a series of inhibitors with different proteolytic enzyme specificities. The cells were maximally stimulated by hypoxia and the effect of the inhibitors on the rate of degradation of the HIF-1 complex was evaluated by gel shift analysis. These experiments indicated that controlled proteolysis was indeed involved in HIF-1 formation and that it was mediated by the proteasome system, since it was markedly affected by lactacystin, a highly specific inhibitor of the 20 S proteasome (23Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Destree A.T. Grenier L. McCormack T.A. Melandri F.D. Nunes S.L. Palombella V.J. Parent L.A. Plamondon L. Stein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). No significant effect was observed with the use of lysosome inhibitors or with inhibitors of interleukin 1β-converting enzyme proteases, the proteolytic system regulating apoptosis. The lack of involvement of this last pathway was further confirmed by the use of a stably transfected cell line overexpressing the anti-apoptotic baculovirus P35 protein (24Robertson N.M. Zangrilli J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Friesen P.D. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 43-47PubMed Google Scholar), which showed no constitutive HIF-1 activation (not shown). The role of proteasomal inhibition in the induction of HIF-1 was then studied in normoxic cells. These experiments clearly demonstrated that proteasomal inhibition induced HIF-1 complex formation in a manner similar to hypoxic stimulation. Further confirmation of the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the regulation of HIF-1α protein levels and HIF-1 complex formation was obtained through the use of a cell line (ts20TG R) containing a temperature-sensitive mutant of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme. These cell lines were originally developed in H. L. Ozer's laboratory and utilized to demonstrate the proteasomal degradation of p53 (17Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell.

When ts20 cells were cultured under normoxic conditions at the permissive temperature no HIF-1 was detected, whereas a shift to 39 °C produced a rapid accumulation of the complex. The HIF-1α protein contain several PEST-like domains, which, in other proteins have been implicated in proteasomal degradation (25Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). However, the actual sequences that determine HIF-1α ubiquitination have not yet been determined. It is of interest to note that proteasome inhibitors, although they clearly induced HIF-1 complex formation in normoxic cells, did not activate gene expression. However, this phenomenon is likely due to a nonspecific toxic effect of these inhibitors since lactacystin produced both a decrease in basal expression of the Epo-promoter driven luciferase reporter gene construct and inhibited the stimulation of its expression by cobalt, desferrioxamine, and hypoxia (data not shown). It is not yet clear if HIF-1 complex formation is necessary and sufficient for transcriptional activation. Results previously reported by Semenza et al.(26Semenza G.L. Jiang B.-H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.-P. Maire P. Giallongo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of HIF-1α in normoxic conditions is sufficient to activate transcription of enolase 1 through its hypoxia response element. The mechanisms of oxygen sensing and the mechanisms by which hypoxia induces stabilization of the HIF-1α protein are currently unknown. The finding by several investigators of an inhibitory effect of H2O2 on HIF-1 formation and Epo gene expression suggested that redox changes are likely to be involved in oxygen sensing and/or signal transduction. Furthermore, Huang et al. (15Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) recently reported that overexpression of the thiol reducing proteins thioredoxin and REF-1 potentiated hypoxia induced gene activation. The dramatic effect observed with the reducing thiol agent NMPG on HIF-1 formation and Epo gene activation in normoxic cells provides a strong indication that redox changes are, indeed, involved in the hypoxic response. The source of the radicals that mediate these signals and the mechanism of action of the reducing agents, are not yet known. A direct redox effect on HIF-1α protein, although possible, seems unlikely, since the normally reducing intracellular environment maintain cytoplasmic proteins already in their reduced states. Alternatively, redox changes could indirectly modify HIF-1α by affecting the activity of redox-sensitive kinases. Preliminary data 3S. Salceda and J. Caro, unpublished data. have shown that the induction of HIF-1 by NMPG could be inhibited by genistein. Mounting evidence suggest that free radicals are central participants in multiple intracellular signal events. The participation of free radicals in hypoxia-treated cells is strongly supported by the fact that 2-acetamidoacrylic acid increased the luciferase activity in B-1-treated cells under normoxic conditions. 2-Acetamidoacrylic acid as well as other N-substituted dehydroalanines have been described to react with and scavenge both superoxide and hydroxyl radicals (27Sipe H.J. Buc-Calderon P. Roberfroid M. Mason R.P. Chem.-Biol. Interactions. 1993; 86: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that antioxidants activate c-fos via a Ras-dependent pathway (28Müller J.M. Cahill M.A. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Nordheim A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Several redox-sensitive kinases have been described and in the case of p21 ras, the mechanism for activation appears to depend on the redox status of Cys118 (29Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L.

Phosphorylation dependent changes of the degradation rate of c-Jun by the proteasome system was recently reported to be dependent on the action of stress-activated mitogen-activated kinases (30Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Since protein phosphorylation is a necessary step in HIF-1 activation, the role of redox-dependent kinases in HIF-1α stabilization is a distinct possibility. We thank Dr. H. L.

https://openalex.org/W1657989568,"A role for β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) in the development of Alzheimer's disease has been indicated by genetics1, and many conditions in which β-APP is raised have been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease or an Alzheimer's-like pathology2,3,4. Inflammatory events may also contribute to Alzheimer's disease5. Here we investigate whether a secreted derivative of β-APP (sAPP-α) can induce inflammatory reactions in microglia, which are brain cells of monocytic lineage. We found that treatment with sAPP-α increased markers of activation in microglia and enhanced their production of neurotoxins. The ability of sAPP-α to activate microglia was blocked by prior incubation of the protein with apolipoprotein E3 but not apolipoprotein E4, a variant associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's6. A product of amyloidogenic β-APP processing (sAPP-β) also activated microglia. Because sAPP-β is deficient in the neuroprotective activity shown by sAPP-α, our results indicate that increased amyloidogenic processing could adversely affect the balance of sAPP activities that determine neuronal viability."
https://openalex.org/W1563724009,"Proteins enter the secretory pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum, which delivers properly folded proteins to their site of action and contains a quality-control system to monitor and prevent abnormal proteins from being delivered. Many of these proteins are degraded by the cytoplasmic proteasome, which requires their retrograde transport to the cytoplasm. Based on a co-immunoprecipitation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I heavy-chain breakdown intermediates with the translocon subunit Sec61p, it was speculated that Sec61p maybe involved in retrograde transport. Here we present functional evidence from genetic studies that Sec61p mediates retrograde transport of a mutated lumenal yeast carboxypeptidase ycsY (CPY*) in vivo. The endoplasmic reticulum lumenal chaperone BiP (Kar2p) and Sec63p, which are also subunits of the import machinery, are involved in export of CPY* to the cytosol. Thus our results demonstrate that retrograde transport of proteins is mediated by a functional translocon. We consider the export of endoplasmic reticulum-localized proteins to the cytosol by the translocon for proteasome degradation to be a general process in eukaryotic cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2163169974,"DNA gyrase is a type II DNA topoisomerase from bacteria that introduces supercoils into DNA. It catalyses the breakage of a DNA duplex (the G segment), the passage of another segment (the T segment) through the break, and then the reunification of the break. This activity involves the opening and dosing of a series of molecular 'gates' which is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Here we present the crystal structure of the 'breakage-reunion' domain of the gyrase at 2.8 A resolution. Comparison of the structure of this 59K (relative molecular mass, 59,000) domain with that of a 92K fragment of yeast topoisomerase II reveals a very different quaternary organization, and we propose that the two structures represent two principal conformations that participate in the enzymatic pathway. The gyrase structure reveals a new dimer contact with a grooved concave surface for binding the G segment and a cluster of conserved charged residues surrounding the active-site tyrosines. It also shows how breakage of the G segment can occur and, together with the topoisomerase II structure, suggests a pathway by which the T segment can be released through the second gate of the enzyme. Mutations that confer resistance to the quinolone antibacterial agents cluster at the new dimer interface, indicating how these drugs might interact with the gyrase-DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W2059659414,"The beta-amyloid peptide, which forms extracellular cerebral deposits in Alzheimer's disease, is derived from a large membrane-spanning glycoprotein referred to as the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). The APP is normally cleaved within the beta-amyloid region by a putative proteinase (alpha-secretase) to generate large soluble amino-terminal derivatives of APP, and this event prevents the beta-amyloid peptide formation. It has been suggested that the gelatinase A (matrix metalloproteinase 2, a 72-kDa type IV collagenase) may act either as alpha-secretase or as beta-secretase. Mice devoid of gelatinase A generated by gene targeting develop normally, except for a subtle delay in their growth, thus providing a useful system to examine the role of gelatinase A in the cleavage and secretion of APP in vivo. We show here that APP is cleaved within the beta-amyloid region and secreted into the extracellular milieu of brain and cultured fibroblasts without gelatinase A activity. The data suggest that gelatinase A does not play an essential role in the generation and release of soluble derivatives of APP at physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1536757970,"DNA double-strand breaks are repaired by homologous recombination or DNA end-joining, but the latter process often causes illegitimate recombination and chromosome rearrangements. One of the factors involved in the end-joining process is Hdf1, a yeast homologue of Ku protein1,2,3,4. We used the yeast two-hybrid assay to show that Hdf1 interacts with Sir4, which is involved in transcriptional silencing at telomeres and HM loci5,6. Analyses of sir4 mutants showed that Sir4 is required for deletion by illegitimate recombination and DNA end-joining in the pathway involving Hdf1. Sir2 and Sir3, but not Sir1, were also found to participate in these processes. Furthermore, mutations of the SIR2, SIR3 and SIR4 genes conferred increased sensitivity to γ-radiation in a genetic background with a mutation of the RAD52 gene, which is essential for double-strand break repair mediated by homologous recombination. These results indicate that Sir proteins are involved in double-strand break repair mediated by end-joining. We propose that Sir proteins act with Hdf1 to alter broken DNA ends to create an inactivated chromatin structure that is essential for the rejoining of DNA ends."
https://openalex.org/W2027724252,"Recycling of ascorbate from its oxidized forms is essential to maintain stores of the vitamin in human cells. Whereas reduction of dehydroascorbate to ascorbate is thought to be largely GSH-dependent, we reconsidered the possibility that the selenium-dependent thioredoxin system might contribute to ascorbate regeneration. We found that purified rat liver thioredoxin reductase functions as an NADPH-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase, with an apparent K m of 2.5 mm for dehydroascorbate, and a k catof 90 min−1. Addition of 2.8 μm purified rat liver thioredoxin lowered the apparent K m to 0.7 mm, without affecting the turnover (k cat of 71 min−1). Since thioredoxin reductase requires selenium, we tested the physiologic importance of this enzyme for dehydroascorbate reduction in livers from control and selenium-deficient rats. Selenium deficiency lowered liver thioredoxin reductase activity by 88%, glutathione peroxidase activity by 99%, and ascorbate content by 33%, but did not affect GSH content. NADPH-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase activity due to thioredoxin reductase, on the basis of inhibition by aurothioglucose, was decreased 88% in dialyzed liver cytosolic fractions from selenium-deficient rats. GSH-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase activity in liver cytosol was variable, but typically 2–3-fold that of NADPH-dependent activity. These results show that the thioredoxin system can reduce dehydroascorbate, and that this function is required for maintenance of liver ascorbate content.

These results show that the thioredoxin system can reduce dehydroascorbate, and that this function is required for maintenance of liver ascorbate content. Ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, is important as a cofactor in several enzyme reactions, and in the defense against oxidant stress (1Levine M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells efficiently regenerate ascorbic acid from its two-electron oxidized form, dehydroascorbate (DHA). 1The abbreviations used are: DHA, dehydroascorbate; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TR, thioredoxin reductase; Trx, thioredoxin. This recycling of DHA to ascorbate is known to be mediated by GSH (2Rose R.C. Bode A.M. Enzyme. 1992; 46: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), either by direct chemical reduction (3Winkler B.S. Orselli S.M. Rex T.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), or with the assistance of one or more GSH-dependent enzymes (4Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Washburn M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Xu D.P. Washburn M.P. Sun G.P. Wells W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 1994; 301: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, a recent report showing that rapid DHA reduction in HL-60 cells was unaffected by GSH depletion (7Guaiquil V.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Vera J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9915-9921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) brings up the possibility that other mechanisms may contribute to DHA recycling. For example, NADPH-dependent DHA reduction has been reported to occur in rat liver through the action of 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (8Del Bello B. Maellaro E. Sugherini L. Santucci A. Comporti M. Casini A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Another potential NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity, the thioredoxin system, was reported not to reduce DHA (9Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian thioredoxin reductase (TR) (EC 1.6.4.5) is a selenoprotein (10Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), that, in conjunction with thioredoxin (Trx), forms an effective system for reduction of protein disulfides (11Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). TR can also reduce many other substrates without the assistance of Trx, including lipoic acid (12Arnér E.S.J. Nordberg J. Holmgren A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), vitamin K3 (13Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (14Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and alloxan (15Holmgren A. Lyckeborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5149-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). DHA resembles alloxan in size and also has a cyclic triketone structure. Given the broad substrate specificity of TR, and the chemical similarities of alloxan and DHA, it was surprising that DHA was reported not to be a substrate of TR (9Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reinvestigated the possibility that rat liver TR alone or in combination with Trx can function as an NADPH-dependent DHA reductase. Our results show that the thioredoxin system can reduce DHA in the presence of NADPH, and that a decrease in this reduction may contribute to lowered ascorbate concentrations in livers of selenium-deficient rats. DHA, d-isoascorbate, and ascorbate 6-palmitate were from Aldrich. Where noted, DHA or its derivative was prepared by bromine oxidation of the reduced form (16Washko P.W. Wang Y. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human placental glutaredoxin (lot 3A) was purchased from IMCO Corporation (Stockholm, Sweden). Glutathione reductase (lot 121H80701), glutathione S-transferase (lot 73H8030), and protein disulfide isomerase (lot 66H4072) were purchased from Sigma. Trx fromEscherichia coli (lot B11094) was purchased from Calbiochem. 6-Sulfophenyl-ascorbate was a generous gift from Dr. K. Wimalasena at Wichita State University, Wichita, KS. TR and Trx were purified from rat liver by the method of Luthman and Holmgren (17Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. The purity of both preparations was judged to be >95% by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specific activity of the TR preparation was 90 ± 6 A 412 units·(mg of protein)−1 (S.D., n = 4) in the insulin assay for TR (14Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 0.2 mm NADPH, purified rat liver TR reduced 0.5 mm DTNB at a rate of 4630 nmol/min per nmol of enzyme, which is similar to that observed by Holmgren (14Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As noted by Holmgren (13Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was necessary to reduce purified rat liver Trx by a 1 h incubation with 2 mmdithiothreitol just before use. The dithiothreitol was separated from Trx on Bio-Rad Bio-Spin 6 columns. Two assays were used to measure NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity. In the first assay, conversion of DHA to ascorbate was measured by incubating purified TR with 0.4 mm NADPH and freshly prepared DHA in 50 mm Tris-HCl that contained 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Following incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 10 volumes of ice-cold 80% methanol (v/v) that contained a final concentration of 1 mm EDTA. After incubation for 5 min on ice, the mixture was microcentrifuged and aliquots of the supernatant were assayed for ascorbate by HPLC with electrochemical detection (18May J.M. Qu Z.C. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10577-10582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, ascorbate generation was linear for at least 20 min, and increased linearly with an increase in the TR concentration from 10–80 nm (results not shown). NADPH alone did not reduce DHA. Commercial DHA contained a small amount of ascorbate (∼0.5%), which was measured and corrected for as a blank in each assay. When prolonged stability of DHA was required, or when a DHA derivative was the substrate, bromine oxidation was used to oxidize the ascorbate-containing form (16Washko P.W. Wang Y. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the second assay of NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity, the disappearance of NADPH was followed spectrophotometrically. The reaction mixture consisted of the indicated concentration of TR, 0.2 mm NADPH, and the substrate to be reduced in the Tris-EDTA buffer. The reaction was started by adding the substrate to a cuvette with mixing, and followed at room temperature by recording the absorbance at 340 nm in a Beckman model 640 spectrophotometer. The rate of NADPH disappearance was linear for at least 3 min, and the nanomoles of NADPH consumed were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 × 103m−1·cm−1. For both assays, the rate of reaction was normalized to the amount of TR present. GSH-dependent DHA reductase activity of purified commercial glutaredoxin and of protein disulfide isomerase was determined by measurement of the rate of appearance of ascorbate at 265 nm (4Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Washburn M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The amount of ascorbate generated was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 14.7 × 103m−1·cm−1 (4Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Washburn M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). From the weanling stage, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a Torula yeast diet that was deficient in selenium, or the same diet that was supplemented with 0.25 ppm selenium as Na2SeO4 to provide an adequate amount of dietary selenium (19Burk R.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rats were fed the diet for at least 14 weeks, during which time they were allowed free access to food and water. In a typical experiment with three animals in each group, the weights of selenium-deficient animals averaged 244 ± 17 g at the time of the experiment, compared with 254 ± 16 g for control animals (mean ± S.D.). Following an overnight fast, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and exsanguinated by removal of blood from the aorta. Tissues were immediately removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until assay of ascorbate content and DHA reductase activity. For measurement of ascorbate, frozen tissue samples (100 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm perchloric acid in a hand-held Teflon homogenizer. After a 5-min incubation on ice, the samples were microcentrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C, and stored on ice until assay. Tissue content of ascorbate is expressed as a concentration, assuming that cellular water comprises 80% by weight of the tissue. For preparation of dialyzed liver cytosolic fractions, frozen liver (400 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl that contained 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The homogenate was microcentrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was placed in dialysis tubing (molecular weight cut-off 3400) and dialyzed overnight against three changes of 250 ml of the Tris-EDTA buffer at 4 °C. The HPLC assay that was used to measure ascorbate generation from DHA also detects GSH. In dialyzed cytosol before addition of DHA, neither ascorbate nor GSH were detectible by HPLC. The lower limits for HPLC detection in the incubated cytosol were 0.1 μm for ascorbate and for 2 μm for GSH. Protein was measured by the BCA method (Pierce). The GSH concentrations shown in Table III were measured by the DTNB-glutathione reductase recycling assay of Tietze (20Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5557) Google Scholar). Glutathione peroxidase activity was measured using H2O2 as substrate in 13,000 ×g supernatants of livers that were homogenized in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (21Lawrence R.A. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). TR activity in 13,000 × g liver supernatants was measured as recently described (22Hill K.E.

Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear least-squares regression of initial rates of reaction using Global Analysis as described previously (23Due A.D. Zhi-Chao Q. Thomas J.M. Buchs A. Powers A.C. May J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5462-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The best fit of the data from multiple experiments was determined from the minimum value of each kinetic parameter in the χ2 distribution. Differences between kinetic parameters were established from the χ2 distribution on the basis of an F test (24Box G.E.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1960; 86: 792-816Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and were considered significant when there was no overlap of their χ2 values below a confidence level of 0.67. Statistical significance of biochemical data was assessed using the statistical software package Sigmastat 2.0 (Jandel Scientific, St. Louis, MO). Purified rat liver TR used NADPH to reduce DHA to ascorbate with a 1:1 stoichiometry, when either the appearance of ascorbate was measured by HPLC or the disappearance of NADPH was measured by spectrophotometry. As shown in Fig. 1, increasing amounts of DHA caused a saturable increase in the rate of DHA reduction by purified rat liver TR alone and by the combination of TR and Trx. The kinetic parameters for these reactions are shown in Table I. Addition of rat liver Trx more than tripled the apparent affinity of TR for DHA, without affecting the turnover number. Trx from E. coli, on the other hand, both tripled the affinity and doubled the catalytic capacity of the enzyme. The measured kinetic parameters of two GSH-dependent enzymes, protein disulfide isomerase and recombinant human placental glutaredoxin, are also shown in Table I. These were similar to the values observed for rat liver TR + Trx.

An asterisk (*) indicates a significant difference (i.e. no overlap in the confidence intervals (C.I.)) from TR + rat liver Trx. TR from rat liver also reduced several derivatives of ascorbate and alloxan, as shown in Table II. Whereas DHA and its isomer iso-DHA were reduced at comparable rates, the more hydrophobic ascorbate derivatives showed much greater rates of reaction. When ascorbate 6-palmitate was oxidized with bromine to the uncharged DHA derivative, a fine precipitate formed that was added directly to the enzyme assay. Differences in solubility from experiment to experiment probably account for the large variability in reaction rates observed. Alloxan and ninhydrin were also reduced manyfold more rapidly by TR than was DHA. Barbituric acid, which lacks the central carbonyl group of alloxan, was not reduced at a concentration of 0.2 mm (data not shown). These results confirm the broad substrate specificity of TR for several different redox-active DHA derivatives and related triketones.Table IIReduction of triketone derivatives by TRAgentRatenmmmin −DHA1.062 ± 137Iso-DHA1.061 ± 756-S-Phenyl-DHA1.0624 ± 58*36-Palmitoyl-DHA1.01263 ± 772*3Alloxan0.23939 ± 1139*5Ninhydrin0.21526 ± 368*4NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activities were measured as the fall in absorbance at 340 nm, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are shown from n experiments at 0.4 mm NADPH and the indicated initial concentration of each derivative.

An asterisk (*) indicates p < 0.05 versusDHA alone by one-way analysis of variance. To test the physiologic importance of TR as a DHA reductase, the effect of selenium deficiency on tissue ascorbate content and on NADPH-dependent DHA reduction in dialyzed liver cytosolic fractions was studied. As shown in TableIII, selenium deficiency markedly decreased the activities of the selenoenzymes TR and glutathione peroxidase, which documents the severity of the selenium deficiency. Selenium deficiency also decreased the liver ascorbate content by one-third compared with that of control rats. The concentration of GSH in liver was unaffected by selenium deficiency. NADPH-dependent DHA reduction in cytosolic fractions prepared from livers of selenium-deficient rats was less than half that measured in controls (Table IV). Aurothioglucose, an inhibitor of TR (22Hill K.E. McCollum G.W. Boeglin M.E. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), was used to enhance the specificity of the assay for TR. At a concentration of 10 μm, aurothioglucose inhibited the NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity of purified rat liver TR by 85% (n = 7). Similarly, addition of 10 μm aurothioglucose decreased the NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity of control cytosol by 75%. Treatment of cytosol from livers of selenium-deficient animals with aurothioglucose caused a smaller decrease in activity, leaving a non-inhibited activity that was similar to that in control cytosol after incubation with aurothioglucose. The difference between total NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity and the residual activity after inhibition by aurothioglucose is shown in the third row of Table IV. This aurothioglucose-sensitive DHA reductase activity was decreased 88% in liver cytosols from selenium-deficient animals compared with controls. The NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity in liver cytosol from control animals increased as a saturable function of the initial DHA concentration, with a half-maximal effect observed at about 1.0 mm DHA (Fig.2).Table IVDHA reductase activity of dialyzed liver cytosol from control and selenium-deficient ratsActivityControlSelenium-deficientnmol·(mg protein) −1 ·min −1Total NADPH-dependent5.4 ± 0.52.0 ± 0.7*+Aurothioglucose1.3 ± 0.41.4 ± 0.2Aurothioglucose-inhibitable4.1 ± 0.70.5 ± 0.5*GSH-dependent15 ± 811 ± 9Liver cytosolic fractions from control and selenium-deficient rats were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and incubated in Tris-EDTA buffer with 1 mm DHA in the presence of either 0.4 mm NADPH or 2 mm GSH.

Data are shown from three livers as mean ± S.D., with an asterisk (*) indicating p < 0.05 compared to control analysis of variance of the NADPH-dependent data. Similar results were observed in another selenium deficiency experiment. GSH-dependent DHA reductase activity was more variable than the NADPH-dependent activity, and was not affected by selenium deficiency (Table IV). The rate of nonenzymatic reduction of DHA by GSH ranged from 20 to 60% of the total activity in different preparations. GSH-dependent DHA reduction was 2–3-fold that of NADPH-dependent activity in most experiments. The present demonstration that purified rat liver TR can reduce DHA to ascorbate extends the already broad substrate specificity of this enzyme (11Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). In addition to DHA, TR also reduced the carbon-5 isomer of DHA and hydrophobic DHA derivatives, the latter much more rapidly than DHA itself. These results, and those with alloxan and its derivatives, suggest that hydrophobic interactions of the substrate with TR can enhance activity, and that a vicinal triketone structure is required for reduction. We have no explanation for the earlier negative results with regard to the DHA reductase activity of TR (9Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The turnover number for DHA reduction by TR, with or without rat liver Trx, was no different than that found for GSH-dependent DHA reduction by recombinant human placental glutaredoxin and protein disulfide isomerase. Maximal rates of DHA reduction by GSH-dependent thioltransferases (glutaredoxins) from different tissues and species vary widely (4Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Washburn M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, recombinant porcine liver thioltransferase has been noted to have a turnover number of 374 min−1 (4Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Washburn M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas a value of 68 min−1 can be calculated for glutaredoxin purified from human neutrophils (25Park J.B. Levine M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The apparent affinity of recombinant human glutaredoxin for DHA of 0.27 mm was similar to that of 0.2 mm reported for purified porcine liver glutaredoxin (9Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of rat liver Trx to TR increased the apparent affinity of the enzyme system for DHA (Fig. 1 and Table I), as previously noted for alloxan (15Holmgren A. Lyckeborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5149-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This suggests that reduction of DHA by Trx occurs, and that the high affinity of TR for Trx (K m = 2.5 μm) (17Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) facilitates the overall reaction. We also tested Trx from E. coli with rat liver Trx and found both an increase in apparent affinity for DHA and a doubling of the maximal catalytic capacity (Table I). The increased apparent affinity of TR for DHA in the presence of E. coli Trx can again be attributed to a high affinity of TR for the bacterial Trx (K m = 35 μm) (17Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The increase in turnover number may reflect an ability of the E. coli Trx to enhance the relatively low catalytic efficiency of TR for DHA. Selenium deficiency decreased the ascorbate content of rat liver by one-third, even though this tissue can synthesize ascorbate. The concentration of GSH in liver was not affected, as expected in this model of moderate selenium deficiency (9Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fall in ascorbate content, therefore, supports a role for selenoenzymes in ascorbate regeneration from DHA. In dialyzed liver cytosol from selenium-deficient rats, NADPH-dependent ascorbate regeneration was decreased to about 40% of that in controls (TableIV). The decrease was even greater when considered as aurothioglucose-sensitive activity. Gold-containing compounds are known to inhibit selenoenzymes (26Chaudiere J. Tappel A.L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 20: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As expected from its inhibition of DTNB and insulin disulfide reduction by rat liver TR (22Hill K.E. McCollum G.W. Boeglin M.E. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), aurothioglucose was also a potent inhibitor of DHA reduction by purified rat liver TR. Since glutathione peroxidase activity is unaffected by 10 μm aurothioglucose (22Hill K.E. McCollum G.W. Boeglin M.E. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we consider the gold-sensitive, NADPH-dependent, DHA reductase activity to reflect that of TR. Based on this reasoning, selenium deficiency decreased TR-dependent DHA reductase activity in liver cytosol by almost 90% (Table IV), or to a similar extent as it did TR-dependent disulfide reduction (Table III). Furthermore, the apparent K m of the DHA reductase activity in dialyzed liver cytosol was 1.0 mm (Fig. 2), which is similar to that of purified rat liver TR + Trx (Table I). The NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity measured in liver cytosol of control rats of about 5 nmol·(mg of protein)−1·min−1 was in between values of 3.6 and about 8 nmol·(mg of protein)−1·min−1 that were measured by Del Bello et al. (8Del Bello B. Maellaro E. Sugherini L. Santucci A. Comporti M. Casini A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and by Rikans et al. (27Rikans L.E. Lopez T.R. Hornbrook K.R. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1996; 91: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), respectively. The former authors went on to purify an NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity from liver that was identified as 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (8Del Bello B. Maellaro E. Sugherini L. Santucci A. Comporti M. Casini A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, since 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase does not code for selenocysteine (28Pawlowski J.E. Huizinga M. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8820-8825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enzyme should not be affected by selenium deficiency or by aurothioglucose. Thus, it is unlikely to have contributed more than 25% of the NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity measured in the current experiments. Further, the apparent K m measured for 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from rat liver was about 4 mm, with a calculated k cat of 59 min−1 (8Del Bello B. Maellaro E. Sugherini L. Santucci A. Comporti M. Casini A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These kinetic parameters also suggest a lesser role for this enzyme in reducing DHA than either glutaredoxin or TR in liver. Direct comparison of GSH- and NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activities in dialyzed liver cytosol was complicated by the variability of GSH-dependent reduction. This variability was related in part to the high rate of nonenzymatic DHA reduction by GSH. GSH-dependent DHA reductase activity was reported in rat liver many years ago (29Hughes R.E. Nature. 1964; 203: 1068-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), although a recent study failed to detect this activity in crude rat liver cytosol (27Rikans L.E. Lopez T.R. Hornbrook K.R. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1996; 91: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Whereas our results support a GSH-dependent DHA reductase activity in liver, more detailed studies will be needed to determine the relative contributions of direct and enzymatic GSH-dependent and NADPH-dependent DHA reduction in liver. These studies show that mammalian TR has DHA reductase activity and that this activity is diminished in liver cytosols from selenium-deficient rats. Decreased TR activity may therefore contribute to the observed decrease in liver ascorbate content of selenium-deficient rats. We appreciate the purification of TR and Trx by G. W. McCollum, and the generous gift of 6-sulfophenyl ascorbate from Dr. K. Wimalasena."
https://openalex.org/W2123493282,"The vesicular gastric H,K-ATPase catalyzes an electroneutral H for K exchange allowing acidification of the intravesicular space. There is a total of 28 cysteines present in the α subunit of the gastric H,K-ATPase, of which 10 are found in the predicted transmembrane segments and their connecting loop, and 9 are present in the β subunit, of which 6 are disulfide-linked. To determine which of these was accessible to extracytoplasmic attack, the enzyme was inhibited by four different substituted 2-pyridylmethylsulfinyl benzimidazoles, 5-methoxy-2-[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]-1<i>H</i>-benzimidazole (omeprazole), 2-[(4-trifluoroethoxy-3-methyl-2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]-1<i>H</i>-benzimidazole (lansoprazole), 5-difluoromethoxy-2-[3,4-methoxy-2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]-1<i>H</i>-benzimidazole (pantoprazole), and 2-[(4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methyl)-2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]-1<i>H</i>-benzimidazole (rabeprazole), under acid transporting conditions. All of these compounds are weak bases that accumulate in the acidic space generated by the pump and undergo an acid catalyzed rearrangement to a cationic sulfenamide, which forms disulfides with accessible cysteines. The relative rates of acid activation of these compounds corresponded to the relative rates of inhibition of ATPase activity and acid transport. Fragmentation of the enzyme by trypsin followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that omeprazole bound covalently to one of the two cysteines in the domains containing the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments and their extracytoplasmic loop and to cysteine 892 in the loop between the seventh and eighth transmembrane segments, but inhibition correlated with the reaction with cysteines in the fifth and sixth domain. Lansoprazole bound to the cysteines in these two domains as well as to cysteine 321 toward the extracytoplasmic end of the third transmembrane segments. Pantoprazole bound only to either cysteine 813 or 822 in the fifth and sixth transmembrane region. The inhibition of Rabeprazole correlated also with its binding to this part of the protein, but this compound continued to bind after full inhibition, eventually binding also to cysteines 321 and 892. No binding was found to any of the cysteines in the seventh to tenth transmembrane segments. Thermolysin digestion of the isolated omeprazole-labeled fifth and sixth transmembrane pair showed that cysteine 813 was the site of labeling. It is concluded that binding of these sided reagents to cysteine 813 in the loop between transmembrane (TM)5 and TM6 is sufficient for inhibition of ATPase activity and acid transport by the gastric acid pump. Of the 10 cysteines present in the membrane and extracytoplasmic domain, only three are exposed sufficiently to allow reactivity with these cationic thiol reagents. The binding to cysteine 813 defines the location of the extracytoplasmic loop between TM5 and TM6 and places the carboxylic acids 820 and 824 conserved between the gastric H,K- and the Na,K-ATPases in TM6, consistent with their assumed role in cation binding."

Previous studies have shown that TNF-α production is regulated by NF-κB induction (29Schutze S. Wiegmann K. Machleidt T. Kronke M. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and that Tat can induce NF-κB activation in glial cells (20Conant K. Ma M. Nath A. Major E.O. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, intracerebral injection of a peptide derived from Tat into rat brain caused increased cytokine production, including TNF-α (30Philippon V. Vellutini C. Gambarelli D. Harkiss G. Arbuthnott G. Metzger D. Roubin R. Filippi P. Virology. 1994; 205: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed experiments to determine the extent to which Tat induces TNF-α production and identify mechanisms involved in TNF-α overexpression. The human astrocytoma cell line U373 and monocytic cell line THP-1 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from healthy volunteers, and whole PBMC and macrophage cultures were prepared as described previously (28Power C. McArthur J.C. Johnson R.T. Griffin D.E. Glass J.D. Dewey R. Chesebro B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 202: 89-104PubMed Google Scholar). Human fetal astrocyte cultures were prepared from human fetal brain specimens of 12–17 weeks gestation (31Furer M. Hartloper V. Wilkins J. Nath A. Cell Adh. Commun. 1993; 1: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). U373 cells and astrocyte cultures were maintained in minimal essential medium with heat-inactivated 10% (v/v) FBS. The PBMC and macrophages cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium with 15% FBS. THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium with 10% FBS and 5.5 μmβ-mercaptoethanol. All cell types were supplemented with 100 μg of streptomycin/ml and 0.25 μg of amphotericin/ml. The U373 cells and astrocytes were cultured to approximately 95% confluence in 24-well plates (≈1 × 106 cells/ml). PBMC, macrophage, and THP-1 cells were cultured at a density of 2.5 × 106, 2.0 × 105, and 1.5 × 106 cells/ml, respectively. Highly purified (>95%) recombinant Tat protein was prepared from the tat gene encoding the first 72 amino acids as outlined previously (21Ma M. Nath A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the functional properties of this protein were confirmed using a transactivation assay in HL3T1 cells containing the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct (21Ma M. Nath A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To establish dose profiles of each cell type, Tat was used at 0, 10, 100, and 1000 nm concentrations for 4 h or 1 h for U373 cells and astrocytes. For time course experiments in PBMC, macrophages, and THP-1 cells, Tat was used at 100 nm concentration, and for U373 cells and astrocytes, Tat was used at 1000 nm concentration for 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Cells were stimulated with LPS from Escherichia coli type 055:B5 (Sigma) 1.0 μg/ml as positive controls. Negative controls included mock (PBS)-treated cells and cells that were treated with either solutions from which Tat had been immunoadsorbed or Tat had been digested with trypsin followed by inactivation with a trypsin inhibitor as described previously (24Magnuson D. Knudsen B.E. Geiger J.D. Brownstone R.M. Nath A. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar,25Nath A. Psooy K. Martin C. Knudsen B. Magnuson D.S.K. Haughey N. Gieger J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1475-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was prepared as described previously (32Jovelin F. Gilbert D. Brard F. Bernardi T. Marche P. Frebourg T. Tron F. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 378-380PubMed Google Scholar) from which first strand cDNA was synthesized as per the manufacturer's protocol (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). PCR was conducted using published primers for TNF-α and β-actin as described previously (33Yamamura M. Uyemura K. Deans R.J. Weinberg K. Rea T.H. Bloom B.R. Modlin R.L. Science. 1991; 254: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). β-Actin primers served as internal controls in each reaction. PCR products were resolved in a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane and probed with [32P]ATP end-labeled oligonucleotide probes to TNF-α or β-actin as described (34Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). TNF-α and β-actin oligonucleotide probes were designed based on the products amplified when using the above primers (TNF-α, 5′-CAAGCTGAGGGGCAGCTCCAGTGG-3′; β-actin, 5′-GAGACCTTCAACACCCCAGCCATGT-3′). TNF-α in tissue culture supernatants was determined by a sandwich ELISA (35Nath A. Slagle B. Wolinsky J.S. Arch. Virol. 1989; 107: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with 2 μg/ml purified monoclonal antiserum to human TNF-α (PharMingen). A biotin-labeled mouse anti-human TNF-α antiserum (0.5 μg/ml) directed against a different epitope (PharMingen) identified TNF-α in the supernatants. The assay detected TNF-α at concentrations as low as 5 pg/ml. Serial doubling dilutions of human recombinant TNF-α (1250 to 4.5 pg/ml) were used to generate a standard curve. All samples were analyzed in triplicates and expressed as mean ± S.D. THP-1 cells cultured in 24-well plates were pretreated for 2 h at 37 °C with either 100 μm TLCK; (Sigma), 20 μm H7 (Calbiochem), 10 μm H89 (Calbiochem), 2 μmHA (Sigma), or 10 μm U73122 (Calbiochem), following which they were incubated with 100 nm Tat. Separate samples were analyzed for TNF-α mRNA and protein. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Cell viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion. To determine if Tat could stimulate TNF-α production, we conducted initial experiments with macrophages, since previous studies have shown that macrophages are the major source of TNF-α and observed that Tat could induce TNF-α in the culture supernatants. TNF-α induction was dose- and time-dependent (Fig.1, A and B), with significant increases seen at concentrations of 10 nm Tat (7.03 ± 1.84 ng/ml versus 0.46 ± 0.25/ng/ml;p < 0.05). TNF-α release occurred as early as 1 h after stimulation and peaked by 4 h (Fig. 1 A). In brain, TNF-α is primarily produced by tissue macrophages similar to that in blood (1Glass J.D. Wesselingh S.L. Selnes O.A. McArthur J.C. Neurology. 1993; 43: 2230-2237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wesselingh S.L. Power C. Glass J.D. Tyor W.R. McArthur J.C. Farber J.M. Griffin J.W. Griffin D.E. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To determine if Tat could release TNF-α in astrocytes, we used highly purified human fetal astrocyte cultures. Although Tat could induce TNF-α in these cells, the dose and time profile was different than that in macrophages (Fig. 1, Cand D). Significant (p < 0.05) increases were observed at only dosages of 1 μm Tat, and the peak levels occurred within 1 h after which there was a progressive decline in TNF-α production (Fig. 1, C andD). Although we used highly purified cultures of macrophages and astrocytes, we could not exclude the possibility of small amounts of other contaminating cell types in these cultures. Hence we also used a human monocytoid (THP-1) and astrocytic (U373) cell line to determine TNF-α induction in response to Tat. Both cell lines responded to Tat. The effect of Tat (1 μm) on U373 cells (0.80 ± 0.07 ng of TNF-α/ml/106 cells) was comparable with that of fetal astrocytes (1.20 ± 0.11 ng of TNF-α/ml/106cells), while THP-1 cells responded to Tat 110 the dosage needed for the astrocyte cell lines (Fig. 1, C andE). Primary macrophages produced 6-fold more TNF-α (15.00 ± 1.05 ng/ml/106 cells) than the THP-1 cells (2.03 ± 0.23 ng/ml/106 cells) with 100 nmTat (Fig. 1, B and F). The time course of TNF-α induction in both cell lines was similar (Fig. 1, A andE). With LPS (positive control), TNF-α was induced in the macrophages (18.20 ± 0.89 ng/ml/106 cells; Fig.2) and THP-1 cells (9.27 ± 0.17 ng/ml/106 cells). In astrocytes and U373 cells, although there was a small induction of mRNA for TNF-α with LPS (Fig.3), levels of TNF-α in culture supernatants was below the level of detection for the ELISA. Tat was thus a more potent inducer of TNF-α protein production as compared with LPS.Figure 3Induction of TNF-α mRNA in monocytoid and astrocytic cells. THP-1 or U373 cells were treated with Tat, and TNF-α mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR followed by Southern blot analysis and compared with that of β-actin. InA, numbers on top indicate h following treatment with 100 nm Tat, which shows a time-dependent increase in TNF-α mRNA levels in THP-1 cells. B, TNF-α mRNA induction in THP-1 cells was seen with 10 nm Tat and increased dose-dependently.C, U373 cells: lane 1, mock (PBS)-treated;lane 2, LPS (1 μg/ml)-treated; and lane 3, Tat (100 nm) treatment shows a small induction of TNF-α mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All experiments were conducted with highly purified recombinant Tat protein. Yet we considered the possibility that TNF-α induction could be due to a contaminant in the Tat preparation. We prepared a trypsin digest of Tat and incubated it with macrophages, since they were most sensitive to induction of TNF-α by Tat. No response was noted in these cells (Fig. 2). Cellular response to Tat was also eliminated by immunoabsorption of Tat with Tat antisera, but not with preimmune rabbit sera, confirming the specificity of Tat action (Fig. 2). Similar results were also seen with THP-1 cells (data not shown). To determine if the induction of TNF-α by Tat occurred at the level of transcription or translation, we measured TNF-α mRNA from THP-1 cells using semiquantitative RT-PCR. Tat induced TNF-α mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner similar to TNF-α protein detection (Fig. 3, A and B). 10 nm Tat produced increases in TNF-α mRNA as early as 1 h, peaking by 4 h and returning to base line by 12 h (Fig. 3 A). A small induction in of TNF-α mRNA was also seen in the U373 cells in response to 100 nm Tat (Fig.3 C). Previous studies had shown that Tat induces NF-κB activation (20Conant K. Ma M. Nath A. Major E.O. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that NF-κB regulates TNF-α production (29Schutze S. Wiegmann K. Machleidt T. Kronke M. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Hence, we conducted experiments to determine if TLCK, a specific blocker of NF-κB activation, could affect Tat-induced TNF-α expression. Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with TLCK caused complete block of TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 4 A) and protein production (Fig. 4 C). Since IκBα is phosphorylated by protein kinases, we used specific blockers for protein kinase C (H7), protein kinase A (H89), and for tyrosine kinase (HA) to identify signaling cascades that are Tat-mediated and activate NF-κB. Both H89 and HA were able to block Tat-induced TNF-α mRNA and protein production while H7 had no effect (Fig. 4, B andC). To determine the role of phospholipase C in this cascade, we pretreated THP-1 cells with U73122, which also blocked the effect of Tat on TNF-α (Fig. 4, B and C). Treatment of the cells with Tat or any of the above pharmacological agents did not effect cell viability (data not shown). We have demonstrated that the Tat protein of HIV-1 induces TNF-α expression in macrophages and astrocytes. Since TNF-α up-regulates HIV expression in infected macrophages (36Locardi C. Petrini C. Boccoli G. Testa U. Dieffenbach C. Butto S. Bellardelli F. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5874-5882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Han X. Becker K. Degen H.J. Jablonowski H. Strohmeyer G. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 26: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and glial cells (38Tornatore C. Nath A. Amemiya K. Major E.O. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6094-6100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and there is an increased expression of TNF-α receptors on macrophages and microglial cells in the brains of patients with HIV infection (39Sippy B.D. Hoffman F.M. Wallach D. Hinton D.R. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1995; 10: 511-521Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), perhaps a positive feedback loop exists whereby only small numbers of infected cells may be necessary to produce substantial amounts of Tat and TNF-α. Furthermore, since both Tat and TNF-α are implicated in neurotoxicity, the neurotoxic effects of Tat would be amplified by its ability to induce TNF-α. TNF-α mRNA levels are elevated in the brains of patients with HIV infection and dementia (6Merrill J.E. Koyanagi Y. Zach J. Thomas L. Martin F. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wesselingh S.L. Power C. Glass J.D. Tyor W.R. McArthur J.C. Farber J.M. Griffin J.W. Griffin D.E. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 40Nuovo G. Gallery F. MacConnel P. Braun A. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 659-666PubMed Google Scholar). Viral transcripts are also increased in patients with HIV dementia (40Nuovo G. Gallery F. MacConnel P. Braun A. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 659-666PubMed Google Scholar). These findings support our observations that the expression of viral transcripts, such as Tat, and cytokines, such as TNF-α, are tightly linked and interdependent. Tat-induced TNF-α production was noted in cells of monocytic lineage and in astrocytes. The macrophages, however, responded to much lower dosages of Tat and produced larger amounts of TNF-α. Previous studies using different stimuli have also shown that TNF-α is predominantly produced by cells of monocytic lineage (14Benveniste E.N. Benos D.J. FASEB. 1995; 9: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 41Lafortune L. Nalbantoglu J. Antel J.P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, brain tissue from adults with AIDS shows that TNF-α immunoreactivity is primarily present in microglial cells and occasionally in astrocytes (1Glass J.D. Wesselingh S.L. Selnes O.A. McArthur J.C. Neurology. 1993; 43: 2230-2237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Viktovic L. da Cunha A. Tyor W.R. Price R.W. Perry S.W. HIV, AIDS and the Brain. Raven Press, Ltd., NY1994: 203-221Google Scholar). However, since astrocytes are the most numerous cell type in the brain and outnumber microglia by several logfold Tat-induced TNF-α production by astrocytes may be biologically significant. In fact, astrocytes can induce HIV replication in macrophages, which is dependent upon the production of TNF-α by astrocytes (42Vitkovic L. Kalebic T. da Cunha A. Fauci A.S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 30: 153-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This may particularly be important for the pathogenesis of HIV dementia in children, since in vitro studies have shown that virtually all human fetal astrocytes are capable of producing TNF-α as opposed to adult astrocytes where only a minority of cells could be induced to express TNF-α in response to agents such LPS and interferon γ (41Lafortune L. Nalbantoglu J. Antel J.P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Since HIV dementia occurs much more frequently in children than adults, differential TNF-α induction by fetal and adult astrocytes may, in part, account for these differences. Consistent with previous studies demonstrating that TNF-α production is regulated by NF-κB (29Schutze S. Wiegmann K. Machleidt T. Kronke M. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we observed that Tat-induced TNF-α production was similarly regulated. However, in contrast to previous observations where macrophage TNF-α production may be be regulated by protein kinase C (43Renier G. Oliver M. Skamene E. Radzioch D. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1413-1421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that inhibition of protein kinase C had no effect on Tat-induced TNF-α mRNA or protein production. Instead, Tat-induced TNF-α production was protein kinase A- and protein tyrosine kinase-dependent. Thus, the regulation of TNF-α gene induction by protein kinases is stimulation-specific. It is likely that these protein kinases are directly or indirectly linked to phospholipase C, since inhibition of phospholipase C also blocked Tat-induced TNF-α production. Although the cascade of events leading to TNF-α production by Tat needs to be further examined, it has been suggested that Tat-mediated inhibition of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase may also play a role (44Westendorp M.O. Shatroo V.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Frank R. Kraft M. Los M. Krammer P.H. Droge W. Lehmann V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Tat is formed from two exons. The first exon contributes to the first 72 amino acids and the second to another 14–22 amino acids. Here we show that Tat derived from the first exon (Tat1–72) is sufficient to induce TNF-α induction. We have previously shown that Tat1–72 is poorly internalized (21Ma M. Nath A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that a number of physiological effects of Tat1–72, such as neuronal excitation (25Nath A. Psooy K. Martin C. Knudsen B. Magnuson D.S.K. Haughey N. Gieger J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1475-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increases in intracellular calcium, and NF-κB induction (19Tardieu M. Hery S. Peudenier O. Boespflug O. Montagnier L. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), are mediated by interactions of Tat with the cell membrane. It is thus likely that Tat-induced TNF-α production is also a membrane-triggered event; however, further studies are necessary to determine the mechanism of TNF-α induction by Tat. In conclusion, the HIV-1 protein, Tat, is an important stimulus for TNF-α production by macrophages and glial cells and that even transient expression of Tat may have detrimental effects on the brain of HIV-infected patients. Thus, therapeutic approaches using combined antiretroviral and anti-TNF-α therapy should be considered for the treatment of HIV dementia. We thank Mark Bernier and Carol Martin for assistance with astrocyte cultures, Tanis Benidictson for preparing the recombinant Tat protein, Terry Langelier for preparing macrophage cultures, and Weimin Ni for assistance with ELISAs."
https://openalex.org/W1496712726,"The accuracy with which listeners can locate sounds is much greater than the spatial sensitivity of single neurons. The broad spatial tuning of auditory neurons indicates that a code based on the responses of ensembles of neurons, a population code, must be used to determine the position of a sound in space. Here we show that the tuning of neurons to the most potent localization cue, the interaural time difference in low-frequency signals (< approximately 2kHz), becomes sharper as the information ascends through the auditory system. We also show that this sharper tuning increases the efficiency of the population code, in the sense that fewer neurons are required to achieve a given acuity."
https://openalex.org/W1670909519,"Synapses in the central nervous system are typically studied by recording electrical responses from the cell body of the postsynaptic cell. Because neurons are normally connected by multiple synaptic contacts, these postsynaptic responses reflect the combined activity of many thousands synapses, and it remains unclear to what extent the properties of individual synapses can be deduced from the population response. We have therefore developed a method for recording the activity of individual hippocampal synapses. By capturing an isolated presynaptic bouton inside a loose-patch pipette and recording from the associated patch of postsynaptic membrane, we were able to detect miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents ('minis') arising from spontaneous vesicle exocytosis at a single synaptic site, and to compare these with minis recorded simultaneously from the cell body. The average peak conductance at a single synapse was about 900 pS, corresponding roughly to the opening of 90 AMPA-type glutamate-receptor channels. The variability in this conductance was about 30%, matching the value reported for the neuromuscular junction. Given that our synapses displayed single postsynaptic densities (PSDs), this variability is larger than would be predicted from the random opening of receptor channels, suggesting that they are not saturated by the content of a single vesicle. Therefore the response to a quantum of neurotransmitter at these synapses is not limited by the number of available postsynaptic receptors."

In these cases theRARα gene is broken prior to the third coding exon and joined to the PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger) gene yielding a fusion protein linking the N-terminal 455 amino acids of PLZF to the B–F domain of RARα, including the DNA binding and ligand binding portions of the nuclear receptor. Reciprocal transcripts were also detected in these patients (8Chang K.S. Stass S.A. Chu D.T. Deaven L.L. Trujillo J.M. Freireich E.J. Mol. Cell.

These similarities do not explain why t(11;17) patients are resistant to therapy, suggesting that the disruption of the PLZF gene plays a role in the clinical phenotype. The PLZF gene encodes a 673 amino acid transcription factor with nine Krüppel-like C2-H2 zinc fingers located within a single region at the C terminus of the protein (19Chen Z. Brand N.J. Chen A.

During murine development, PLZF is highly expressed in the developing central nervous system, limb buds, and the perinatal kidney, liver, and heart (28Cook M. Gould A. Brand N. Davies J. Strutt P. Shaknovich R. Licht J. Waxman S. Chen Z. Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Krumlauf R. Zelent A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2249-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Avantaggiato V. Pandolfi P. Ruthardt M. Hawe N. Acampora D. Pelicci P. Simeone A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4927-4942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the hematopoietic system, PLZF is expressed in early CD34+ progenitor cells and in primitive multipotent hematopoietic cell lines (30Reid A. Gould A. Brand N. Cook M. Strutt P. Li J. Licht J. Waxman S. Krumlauf R. Zelent A. Blood. 1995; 86: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PLZFtranscripts in myeloid HL60 and NB4 cells decline during retinoic acid-induced differentiation (19Chen Z. Brand N.J. Chen A. Chen S.J. Tong J.H. Wang Z.Y. Waxman S. Zelent A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) suggesting that PLZF plays an important role in myeloid development. To understand the function of the PLZF protein, we performed two sets of DNA-binding site selection. PLZF bound to a specific selected DNA sequence with high specificity through its most carboxyl seven zinc fingers that are also present in the t(11;17) fusion protein RARα-PLZF. In transient transfection experiments, a Gal4p-PLZF fusion protein was a potent transcriptional repressor. Mapping experiments revealed two non-contiguous repression domains within the N-terminal region of PLZF, one the evolutionarily conserved POZ domain. PLZF also repressed transcription through its cognate binding site. In contrast, the RARα-PLZF protein modestly activated transcription of a reporter containing five PLZF response sites. These data suggest that the deregulation of PLZF target genes by RARα-PLZF may be partially responsible for the aggressive clinical phenotype of t(11;17) APL. To construct GST-9ZF, the PLZF cDNA (19Chen Z. Brand N.J. Chen A. Chen S.J. Tong J.H. Wang Z.Y. Waxman S. Zelent A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) was digested with NcoI to release the sequences encoding the N-terminal effector domain and recircularized. Sequences encoding the nine zinc fingers of PLZF were then excised by digestion with EcoRI and inserted intoEcoRI-digested pGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). GST-7ZF was synthesized by digesting the PLZF cDNA with SacI andEcoRI and inserting this fragment into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) digested with BamHI and EcoRI utilizing an adapter of Sequence 1.5′*GATCGTTAACGAGCT*3′3′*CAATTGC*5′SEQUENCE*1GST-2ZF was constructed by amplification of a portion of the PLZF cDNA with the N-terminal primer 5′ GGATCCGGATCCCCGTGGGCATGAAGTCA 3′ and the C-terminal primer 5′ GAATTCGAATTCAGAACTGCTGCTCTGGGT 3′. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into pGEX-3X digested with BamHI and EcoRI.

Gal4p-PLZF fusion constructs were made by amplification of segments of the PLZF coding sequence by PCR, digestion of these fragments with BamHI and XbaI, and insertion of these sequences into pGBX1 a plasmid encoding Gal4p amino acids 1–147, digested with BamHI and XbaI. Sequences encoding PLZF fragments beginning with amino acid 1 were amplified with the N-terminal primer 5′ CGCGGATCCGTATGGATCTGACAAAAATG 3′. Sequences encoding fragments of PLZF beginning with amino acid 99 were amplified with the N-terminal primer 5′ CGCGGATCCGTCTGGATGACCTGCTGTAT. Sequences encoding fragments of PLZF beginning with amino acid 200 were amplified with the N-terminal primer 5′ CGCGGATCCGTAAGGCTGCAGTGGACAGTTTG 3′. Sequences encoding fragments of PLZF beginning with amino acids 300 were amplified with the N-terminal primer 5′ CGCGGATCCGTGAGGAGAGTCGCCTCGAGCAG 3′. Sequences encoding fragments of PLZF ending with amino acid 100 were amplified with the C-terminal primer 5′ GCTCTAGAGATCCAGGGCCTCCGCCTTG 3′.

Reporter construct G5 tk-CAT was described previously (32Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar).

Bacterial expression plasmids were transformed into the DnaJ-deficient Escherichia coli K12 strain CAG748 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). To produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, exponentially growing cultures of transformed bacteria were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C and lysed by sonication with the fusion protein purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described (34Smith D.B.

Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). GST protein-coated agarose beads were stored at −20 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 μm ZnSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol (36Fainsod A. Margalit Y. Haffner R. Gruenbaum Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To purify GST fusion proteins for mobility shift assays, 250 μl of agarose beads were incubated with 10 ml of crude bacterial extract for 1 h in 4 °C and then were washed three times in 15 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The bound proteins were then eluted from the beads by incubation with a buffer containing 20 mm reduced glutathione, 100 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.45, and 900 μl of water for 1 h at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, the beads were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. The resulting protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). To prepare a pool of random oligomers for the first set of binding site selections, an oligonucleotide (500 ng) of the sequence 5′ GGGACAATTCAACTGCCATCTAGGC (N)20 ACACCGAGTCAGAAGGATCCTACG 3′ was hybridized to primer RP2 (250 ng) of the sequence 5′ CGTAGGATCCTTCTGGACTCGGTGT 3′ in a total volume of 10 μl. Five μl of the annealed DNA was extended to make a duplex random oligonucleotide pool with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs) with a final concentration of 0.25 mm each dNTP at 37 °C in a volume of 50 μl. After 1 h of incubation, 5 μl of 2.5 mm each dNTP was added to the extension reaction, and the incubation in 37 °C was continued for another 30 min. The duplex oligomers were ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), phosphorylated with T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mm), and purified using a spin column (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). PLZF binding sites were selected by incubating the random oligomers with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of GST-9ZF-coated agarose beads (about 3 μg of protein) in siliconized Eppendorf tubes in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol (buffer A). After 1 h of incubation on ice, the beads were collected by centrifugation, the supernatant containing unbound DNA was removed, and the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A. The oligomers retained by the beads were released by addition of 20 μl of deionized water and boiling for 5 min. The resulting DNA was subjected to PCR amplification with primer RP2, described above, and primer RP3 of the sequence 5′ GGGAGAATTCAACTGCCATCTAGGC 3′. The reaction (50 μl) contained 0.25 mm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.05 mm dCTP, and 3 μl of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) to radiolabel the PCR products. Twenty cycles of PCR were performed, consisting of 1 min in 95 °C, 1 min in 59 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Subsequently, 1 μl of mixture of 2.5 mm of each dNTP was added to the reaction followed by one cycle of 5 min in 95 °C, 2 min in 59 °C, and 15 min in 72 °C. The amplified DNA was purified by spin column and used in a subsequent round of binding site selection. The success of each selection round was monitored by the increasing percentage of radiolabeled probe oligomer retained of the GST-PLZF beads. After six rounds of selection, the selected DNA was reamplified using radiolabeled dCTP as above, purified, and incubated with approximately 3 μg of GST-9ZF protein in a 20-μl reaction containing buffer A. The resulting DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through a 6% (30:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gel. The retarded DNA-protein complex was excised, crushed, and soaked overnight in 300 μl of 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA. The eluted DNA was ethanol-precipitated, digested with BamHI andEcoRI, subcloned into the polylinker region of pBluescriptSK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), transformed intoE. coli, and sequenced. A total of 29 clones was sequenced in this set of selections. In the second set of binding site selection, the random oligomers used had the sequence 5′ GGGACAATTCAACTGCCATCTAGGC (N)13 TAAA (N)13 ACACCGAGTCAGAAGGATCCTACG 3′. Duplex oligomers were created by primer extension with the RP2 primer, and fours rounds of binding site selection was performed as described above. The selected DNA was digested with BamHI andEcoRI, subcloned into pBluescript SK+, and 42 individual clones were sequenced. A synthetic duplex oligomer probe A of the sequence indicated above was labeled by filling in with the Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and purified by spin column. Each binding reaction (20 μl) contained approximately 2 μg of batch-purified GST or GST-9ZF as measured by A 280 and 26 fmol of labeled DNA (approximately 0.6 ng) in a buffer of 20 mm ZnCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The binding reactions were incubated on ice for 1 h. In competition electrophoretic mobility shift assays, unlabeled DNA competitors were preincubated with GST-9ZF for 15 min on ice, followed by the addition of labeled duplex oligonucleotide and incubation on ice for 45 min. The resulting DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis at 200 V through either 4 or 6% polyacrylamide gels (30:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) for 3.5 h at room temperature.

Reporter and effector plasmids in the amounts indicated in the figure legends along with 1 μg of a growth hormone internal control reporter gene (37Selden R.F. Burke-Howie K. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M.

Grossel M. Shaknovich R. Hansen U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4057-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 48 h post-transfection, the cell media were collected and assayed for growth hormone (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA), and the transfected cells were harvested, and cell lysates were assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). The percent conversion of unacetylated to acetylated chloramphenicol was quantified by analysis of chromatography plates on a PhosphorImager using Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) or by densitometric analysis (NIH Image 1.56) of scanned images of the chromatograms. Graphics were scanned on an Arcus II scanner (Agfa, Germany) and assembled on a Power Macintosh 7100/66 computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA). To identify the cognate binding site of PLZF, the sequence encoding the nine zinc fingers was fused in-frame to the glutathione S-transferase gene. The resulting fusion protein (GST-9ZF) (Fig.1) was immobilized on glutathione-coated agarose beads and incubated with a pool of random oligomers (Fig.2 B). After six rounds of binding site selection, the resulting pool of DNA was radiolabeled and incubated with GST-9ZF in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The DNA in the shifted band was eluted, amplified by PCR, and subcloned. Twenty-nine independent clones were sequenced (TableI), and although a consensus binding site sequence could not be formulated from the results of the first selection, it was observed that most of the selected sequences contained either TAA or TAAA. One of the sequences, 15A, was found in 5 out of 29 clones. EMSA assays with the 15A probe, however, indicated that the binding was relatively nonspecific as binding could be competed with an excess of unlabeled GAL4 operator, a non-TA-rich oligomer (data not shown). Because of the relative nonspecificity of binding, another set of selection was performed.Table IPLZF binding sites selected after the first set of binding site selectionSequenceNumber of clonesTAAA GGAAGCCACCATGAA5GCTAACTTCTTAAATAGACGA4TGGAGCGTCAAGGTGCAAAC2CAAATAAAGGCCCTCGTACT2TCGGGCTGAATCTAACCATG2ATAACTAATCGAAGGACCTG2GTATATAAACCTGTAGTAAC2TGGGTGCTTCTGTGTCCCT2ACAGTAGAATCGGTAATAAT1TGGAGACTGTGCAACAGAAT1GCACAGGTAATAGGGGTAAA1CTGTAAGGTTGGTATCCTCA1AGGGGTTTCGGTGTGGGCAA1CCATAAATTAGAACAACTAT1GTGTTGGGAATAATTTGTGTTA1TAACACAAATTATTCCCAAC1Most of the sequences contained either TAA or TAAA (underlined).

One of the sequences that contained TAAA was found in 5 out of 29 clones. In the second set of selections, the sequence TAAA, frequently found in the first set of selected DNA fragments was embedded in middle of the random sequence region (Fig. 2 B). Four rounds were performed; by the end of the fourth round 46% of the labeled probe bound to GST-9ZF beads. The selected DNA was subcloned, and the sequences for 42 clones were determined; only eight different sequences were found and one sequence (A) was found in 19 of the 42 clones (TableII). The affinity of GST-9ZF for this site was tested in a series of competition electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 3). GST-9ZF formed a highly specific complex with site A. A 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled A oligomer completely abolished labeled retarded complex, whereas addition of up to a 1000-fold molar excess of GAL4, p53, or WT1 binding sites did not significantly compete with site A for GST-9ZF binding.Table IISequences selected after the second set of binding site selectionSequenceNumber of clonesTTGTATTGAAGCTAAA GTTTGATCTGTTC19 Site AACTAGTCGTCCGGTAAATCATTAATAAAGT7 Site BAGTCATTCGGTTTTAAAGCTGTGCTAGTTC6 Site CCGGACTCATGTTGTAAAAGATTGCCGTGTG2GTGCAGGAATAAACATCATGTTACAC2GTCTAGGTTATTAAAACCGAATCTGCAT2GTCGAGACGTTGTAAACATAGTAATCGCG2GAGGCACTAGGTCGATAAAACAAAGTTATGGG2Only eight different sequences were obtained.

https://openalex.org/W2000245366,"In oligodendrocyte processes, methacholine-evoked Ca2+ waves propagate via regions of specialized Ca2+ release kinetics (wave amplification sites) at which the amplitude and rate of rise of local Ca2+ signals are markedly higher than in surrounding areas (Simpson, P. B., and Russell, J. T. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 33493–33501). In the present study we have examined the effects of other phosphoinositide-coupled agonists on Ca2+ in these cells, and the structural specializations underlying regenerative wave amplification sites. Both bradykinin and norepinephrine evoke Ca2+ waves, which initiate at the same loci and propagate through the cell body and multiple processes via identical wave amplification sites. Antibodies against type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R2) and calreticulin identify expression of these proteins in oligodendrocyte membranes in Western blots. Immunocytochemistry followed by high resolution fluorescence microscopy revealed that both InsP3R2 and calreticulin are expressed in high intensity patches along processes. Cross-correlation analysis of the profiles of local Ca2+release kinetics during a Ca2+ wave and immunofluorescence for these proteins along cellular processes showed that the domains of high endoplasmic reticulum protein expression correspond closely to wave amplification sites. Staining cells with the mitochondrial dye, MitoTracker®, showed that mitochondria are only found in intimate association with these sites possessing high density endoplasmic reticulum proteins, and they remain in the same locations over relatively long periods of time. It appears, therefore, that multiple specializations are found at domains of elevated Ca2+ release in oligodendrocyte processes, including high levels of calreticulin, InsP3R2 Ca2+ release channels, and mitochondria. In oligodendrocyte processes, methacholine-evoked Ca2+ waves propagate via regions of specialized Ca2+ release kinetics (wave amplification sites) at which the amplitude and rate of rise of local Ca2+ signals are markedly higher than in surrounding areas (Simpson, P. B., and Russell, J. T. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 33493–33501). In the present study we have examined the effects of other phosphoinositide-coupled agonists on Ca2+ in these cells, and the structural specializations underlying regenerative wave amplification sites. Both bradykinin and norepinephrine evoke Ca2+ waves, which initiate at the same loci and propagate through the cell body and multiple processes via identical wave amplification sites. Antibodies against type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R2) and calreticulin identify expression of these proteins in oligodendrocyte membranes in Western blots. Immunocytochemistry followed by high resolution fluorescence microscopy revealed that both InsP3R2 and calreticulin are expressed in high intensity patches along processes. Cross-correlation analysis of the profiles of local Ca2+release kinetics during a Ca2+ wave and immunofluorescence for these proteins along cellular processes showed that the domains of high endoplasmic reticulum protein expression correspond closely to wave amplification sites. Staining cells with the mitochondrial dye, MitoTracker®, showed that mitochondria are only found in intimate association with these sites possessing high density endoplasmic reticulum proteins, and they remain in the same locations over relatively long periods of time. It appears, therefore, that multiple specializations are found at domains of elevated Ca2+ release in oligodendrocyte processes, including high levels of calreticulin, InsP3R2 Ca2+ release channels, and mitochondria.

They are also thought to be important in localizing Ca2+ to sites of release, and in modulating release activity, via protein-protein interactions with release channels (1Ikemoto N. Ronjat M.

Cell. 1995; 82: 765-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The best described of these Ca2+-binding proteins are calsequestrin and calreticulin. In many cells, calreticulin is the major calcium-binding protein of the ER lumen (2Milner R.E. Famulski K.S. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 112: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,5Nori A. Villa A. Podini P. Witcher D.R. Volpe P. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Three subtypes of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) are now known (see Ref. 6Simpson P.B. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar for review), which can have different modulatory properties and discrete functions even when expressed together in the same cell (7Simpson P.B.

Physiol. 1996; 270: C1255-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Localization of calreticulin to InsP3R-containing membrane vesicles has been reported in some cell types using density gradient techniques (2Milner R.E. Famulski K.S. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 112: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,10Enyedi P. Szabadkai G. Krause K.-H. Lew D.P. Spat A. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The function of this coexpression, however, has remained controversial. Recent reports have indicated that calreticulin may play a role in regulating Ca2+ signals, including perhaps serving as a luminal sensor for Ca2+ store depletion (4Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Cell. 1995; 82: 765-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,11Bastianutto C. Clementi E. Codazzi F. Podini P. De Giorgi F. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). InsP3-mediated Ca2+ waves in several cell types propagate over long distances by regenerative Ca2+ release at specialized cellular domains (12Yagodin S.V. Holtzclaw L. Sheppard C.A. Russell J.T. J.

Biol. 1996; 6: 855-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In glial cells, these specialized wave amplification sites are characterized by significantly higher amplitude in local Ca2+ signals and steeper rate of rise of the signals (12Yagodin S.V. Holtzclaw L. Sheppard C.A. Russell J.T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol.

Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Ca2+ waves typically travel in complex nonlinear paths through three-dimensional space (12Yagodin S.V. Holtzclaw L. Sheppard C.A. Russell J.T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,15Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Curr.

Nature. 1995; 377: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), making analysis of their mechanisms of propagation problematical. In recent studies, however, we have investigated Ca2+ waves in cultured cortical oligodendrocytes which because of their long, thin, relatively linear processes, allow for the analysis of Ca2+ waves as one dimensional propagatory entities. Oligodendrocytes express a variety of receptors coupled to the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and consequent mobilization of Ca2+ from InsP3R-expressing intracellular stores. These include α1A adrenoreceptors, M1 muscarinic cholinoceptors, and bradykinin receptors (20Kastritsis C.H. McCarthy K.D. Glia. 1993; 8: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Marriott D.R. Wilkin G.P. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 826-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Cohen R.I. Almazan G.

We have previously demonstrated that oligodendrocytes respond to the muscarinic receptor agonist methacholine (MCh) by the induction of Ca2+ waves initiating in several distinct regions of oligodendrocyte processes. These waves travel along each process and into the cell body via multiple amplification sites (14Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33493-33501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). One or more mitochondria are closely associated with each of these specialized Ca2+ wave amplification sites in oligodendrocytes, and inhibition of mitochondrial activity markedly affects methacholine-evoked Ca2+ responses (14Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33493-33501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to investigate whether specializations in ER protein distribution as well as mitochondrial location would underlie the specialized Ca2+ release sites found during InsP3-evoked Ca2+ waves. Our results indicate that type 2 InsP3Rs (InsP3R2), and calreticulin, are expressed in much higher intensity at Ca2+ wave amplification sites along oligodendrocyte processes compared with other regions. Furthermore, in the processes stationary mitochondria were found only at these specialized Ca2+ release sites in close association with high density of ER proteins. These findings suggest that wave propagation in glia may be modulated by specialized microdomains of Ca2+release involving both mitochondria and ER proteins. (±)-Norepinephrine hydrochloride and acetyl-β-methylcholine chloride were obtained from Sigma. Bradykinin, fura 2-AM and fluo 3-AM were obtained from Research Biochemicals International. MitoTracker CMXRos was from Molecular Probes. PA3-900 was from Affinity Bioreagents Inc. AP42 was a gift from Dr. A. Sharp (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Oligodendrocytes were prepared from 2-day-old rat pups as described previously (14Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33493-33501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Patneau D.K. Wright P.W. Winters C. Mayer M.L. Gallo V. Neuron. 1994; 12: 357-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices were removed and manually dissociated, and cells cultured in plastic flasks (25McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). After 8 days in vitro, the flasks were vigorously shaken overnight. The supernatant was repeatedly plated onto plastic dishes, to which endothelial cells, microglia, and fibroblasts quickly attach. Non-adherent cells were then replated onto glass coverslips coated with 0.1 mg/ml polyornithine. Cells were cultured in DME-N1 containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h, and thereafter in DME-N1 containing 2% fetal bovine serum, and maintained in 10% CO2, 90% air, under which conditions the bipotential cells developed into oligodendrocytes. Cells were >85% positive for the oligodendrocyte marker galactocerebroside. Culture medium was replaced every 3 days, and all cells were used 4–8 days after replating. For the study of Ca2+ wave propagation in glial cell processes, cells were incubated with 5 μm fluo 3-AM for 20 min at room temperature as described previously (12Yagodin S.V. Holtzclaw L. Sheppard C.A. Russell J.T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Fatatis A. Russell J.T. Glia. 1992; 5: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in a Leiden coverslip chamber continuously perfused with balanced salt solution. The perfusion chamber was positioned on the stage of an inverted microscope, and fluorescence images acquired at 495 nm excitation (510 nm emission) wavelength through a microchannel plate intensifier with a CCD camera (12Yagodin S.V. Holtzclaw L. Sheppard C.A. Russell J.T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Images were digitized and averaged (2 frames at each wavelength) in a Trapix 55/4256 image processor. Cells were divided for analysis into 0.8–2.0-μm-wide regions sequentially along the longitudinal axis of the cell (14Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33493-33501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity values in the nonzero pixels within each slice were averaged (F) and plotted as normalized fluorescence intensities (ΔF/F) against time, where ΔF was calculated as the difference between the average value of the first 20 data points prior to stimulation of the cell and F. Oligodendrocyte membranes were prepared and Western blots performed according to previously published methods (7Simpson P.B. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2369-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were separated in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the Phastgel system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk, followed by incubation in primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution). After incubation in peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Amersham Corp.), blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. Rabbit polyclonal antibody AP42, raised against a peptide sequence corresponding to the C-terminal region of mouse InsP3R subtype 2 (GSNTPHENHHMPPH) (27Ross C.A. Danoff S.K. Schell M.J. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4265-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. A. Sharp. This sequence is unconserved, i.e.it is not present in the other known subtypes of InsP3R or in any other known oligodendrocyte protein. PA3-900, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant human calreticulin produced in the baculovirus insect cell system (28Stendahl O. Krause K.H. Krischer J. Jerstrom P. Theler J.M. Clark R.A. Carpentier J.L. Lew D.P. Science. 1994; 265: 1439-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), was from Affinity Bioreagents. Immunocytochemistry on either naive cells or cells in which Ca2+ waves were first measured was performed as described previously (14Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33493-33501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunocytochemical Laboratories) were used as appropriate. Briefly, cells were fixed in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 3 min, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.1), then incubated in primary antibody (1:200 for anti-InsP3R antibodies, 1:300 for anti-calreticulin) overnight at 4 °C. After further PBS washes, cell were incubated for 1–2 h in secondary antibody (1:400 dilution in 10% goat serum). Cells were then washed three times, and the coverslips were mounted on a glass microscope slide using Mowiol. Controls consisted of substitution of the primary antibody with normal serum from the same host species, used at a dilution equal to that of the primary antibody, and consistently showed negligible fluorescence levels. For the study of mitochondrial distribution, living cells were incubated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (500 nm, 30 min, Molecular Probes) at 37 °C, then washed in prewarmed PBS. Cells were then imaged using a Cy3 filter set in a fluorescence microscope. To examine the spatial relationship between mitochondria and ER markers, MitoTracker-loaded cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (4 min, 4 °C) and 100% methanol (−20 °C, 3 min), washed, and developed for immunocytochemistry as above. Use of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies enabled good resolution and separation of antibody fluorescence from that of MitoTracker. Cells previously subjected to [Ca2+] i measurements were processed for immunocytochemistry or organelle labeling on the microscope stage following the same procedures described for naive cells. For comparison of immunofluorescence or mitochondrial staining with Ca2+ release kinetics, cells were imaged in the Ca2+ imaging system using a Cy3 filter set (Chroma Technologies, Inc., Brattleboro, VT). For analysis of subcellular immunofluorescence with high resolution, a digital confocal microscopy technique was employed (14Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33493-33501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For this, cells were imaged with a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Inc., Tucson, AZ) using the Cellscan software environment (Scanalytics, Inc., Billerica, MA). The Cellscan environment allows for acquisition of wide angle fluorescence microscope images at all the focal planes through cells (z-series). Images are then restored using a deconvolution procedure (extensive photon reassignment protocol, EPR) into confocal images by removing out-of-focus light. The software system is based on the algorithm developed by Dr. Fay and co-workers (14Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33493-33501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Carrington W.A. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. Foster K. Non-invasive Techniques in Cell Biology. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 53-72Google Scholar). The algorithm used the point-spread function of the microscope obtained by acquiring a z-series images of a subresolution polystyrene bead 200 nm in diameter filled with fluorophore. This data set was used by the algorithm to reassign out-of-focus plane light, which causes blurring of confocal images (29Carrington W.A. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. Foster K. Non-invasive Techniques in Cell Biology. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 53-72Google Scholar). Under our measurement conditions, thez-resolution by our optics was 0.48 μm (measured as full width at half-maximum intensity). The spatial patterns of local Ca2+ release kinetics measured in 0.83-μm-wide subregions of oligodendrocyte processes and of mitochondrial distribution measured by fluorescently tagging mitochondria in the same cells were compared using a cross-correlation function as a quantitative test for similarity (14Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33493-33501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 30Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in Pascal. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1989: 120-129Google Scholar). Cross-correlation function is derived from the fast Fourier transform of the two data sets being compared. For this analysis the mean values of the amplitudes in the patterns were subtracted out and the resulting zero mean waves were embedded in surrounding zeros, to eliminate circular correlations, i.e.between the beginning and end of the data sets, due to the periodic nature of Fourier series (30Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in Pascal. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1989: 120-129Google Scholar). The data were then analyzed via a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm, using standard functions in Mathematica (Wolfram Research Inc.). Cross-spectra were formed as a product of one data set with the complex conjugate transform of a second data set. The cross-correlation function was produced by inverse Fourier transformation of the cross-spectrum. Performing these operations on a single data set produced the power density spectrum and the auto-correlation function. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. The validity of this quantitative analysis technique was evaluated in two different control experiments. In one, we compared synthesized noisy sine waves of identical frequency but slightly out of phase with each other (Fig. 4 A, bottom traces). The cross-correlation of these waveforms (Fig. 4 B, solid circles) is a wave pattern of the same frequency as the original waves, with peak correlation shifted from phase to a position equivalent to the delay between the two signals. The noise experimentally inserted into the two sine waves (see figure legend) has minimal effect on the outcome of the cross-correlation. In the second control experiment, a real data set was compared with a scrambled data set (Fig. 4 A, top traces) to determine if chance alone would cause high cross-correlation. The method used was a random permutation in the order of the data points, generated by the program Random Permutation in the Discrete package of Mathematica. By this method non-correlational statistics (mean, variance, and all other parameters of the distribution) were kept constant, but spatial correlations were deleted via a random permutation in the order of the data points. The bottom patterns in Fig. 4 A are equivalent to the data presented in Fig. 4 C (see below), except that one of the patterns has been scrambled with respect to position. The resultant cross-correlation (Fig. 4 B,open circles) is a somewhat noisy, relatively flat function that does not greatly deviate from zero correlation at any delay, unlike the cross-correlation function of the original data sets shown in Fig. 4 D. These results are consistent with cross-correlation analysis conservatively detecting genuine but not coincidental correlations within related data sets. Initial experiments characterized Ca2+ waves in oligodendrocytes evoked by activation of different phosphoinositide-coupled receptors. Oligodendrocytes stimulated with norepinephrine (200 nm) or bradykinin (200 μm) responded with propagating Ca2+ wavefronts. High resolution spatiotemporal analysis revealed that these waves initiated at discrete cellular regions and propagated along the processes and the cell body. In Fig.1 (A and B), offset plots show typical time course of the local changes in [Ca2+] observed in successive 2.0-μm-wide sections of the same cell receiving the two stimuli. Ca2+ waves initiated at four distinct sites where the wave reaches 50% of maximum amplitude sooner than surrounding regions. These wave initiation sites (marked with asterisks) are identifiable as the local “minima” in Fig. 1 C. Three are located in cellular processes and one in the cell body. In contrast wave amplification occurs at other more numerous loci. At these wave amplification sites (marked with arrows), the magnitude and rate of Ca2+ rise were substantially higher than in surrounding regions (Fig. 1, D and E). We have previously described similar distinct initiation and propagation domains in oligodendrocytes responding to methacholine (14Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33493-33501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and in astrocytes responding to norepinephrine (12Yagodin S.V. Holtzclaw L. Sheppard C.A. Russell J.T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Yagodin S. Holtzclaw L.A. Russell J.T. Mol Cell Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 137-144Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Applying the cross-correlation analysis also used in the previous work, we have now examined the distribution of sites associated with responses to norepinephrine and bradykinin. Local Ca2+ peak amplitudes had a maximal cross-correlation coefficient of 0.81 at 0.0 μm from phase. Similarly, the comparison between the half-rise time and the rates of Ca2+ rise for norepinephrine and bradykinin responses gave peak coefficients of 0.79 and 0.75 at 2.0 μm from phase. Such analysis also confirms that wave initiation and amplification sites are indeed distinct. For example, comparison of half-rise time for bradykinin with norepinephrine local Ca2+ peak amplitudes had a maximal coefficient of 0.08 at 0.0 μm. Other control analyses (see “Experimental Procedures”) established that this analytical protocol does not readily identify false positive relationships. The expression of InsP3R2 and calreticulin in oligodendrocytes was investigated using Western blotting and immunocytochemical analyses. The antibody AP42, raised against an unique sequence in the C-terminal region of InsP3R2, detected a single band of approximately 250 kDa in oligodendrocyte membranes (Fig.2 A), consistent with the expected size of this protein from previous reports (8Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 27Ross C.A. Danoff S.K. Schell M.J. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4265-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Previous experiments clearly showed that this antibody does not cross-react with either InsP3R1 or InsP3R3. Antibody PA3-900, raised against recombinant human calreticulin, reacted against a single band at approximately 60 kDa (Fig. 2 B) (28Stendahl O. Krause K.H. Krischer J. Jerstrom P. Theler J.M. Clark R.A. Carpentier J.L. Lew D.P. Science. 1994; 265: 1439-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), indicating the expression of calreticulin in or associated with oligodendrocyte membranes. These antibodies were then used to investigate the distribution of InsP3R2 and calreticulin in oligodendrocytes using standard immunocytochemical techniques and high resolution fluorescence microscopy (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 3). InsP3R2 immunofluorescence (Fig. 3 A) was found distributed in a variegated manner throughout the cell body, except the nucleus, and along the length of the cell processes. Similarly, calreticulin immunofluorescence was also found in the cell body and in a punctate pattern along oligodendrocyte processes (Fig. 3 B). The size of these clusters of immunofluorescence varied between different cells, being typically longer and more graded in thick processes, but small and highly punctate in thin processes (see also Fig. 5).Figure 3Distribution of InsP3R2, calreticulin, and mitochondria in oligodendrocytes. A andB, digital images of oligodendrocytes reacted with AP42 (A) and PA3-900 (B). Image in A is a single plane digital confocal image through the nucleus of a cell (see “Experimental Procedures”). While the nucleus shows no staining with AP42, InsP3R2 immunofluorescence is detectable in most of the cell body and in a variegated pattern along the processes. The image in B is a single digital confocal image from another cell incubated with the anti-calreticulin antibody, PA3-900. This optical section is from a region just above the nucleus of the cell. Note that calreticulin immunofluorescence also extends throughout the cell and, in processes, the staining appears in patches. Like InsP3R2, calreticulin immunofluorescence also does not extend into the nucleus in other optical sections (data not shown).Scale bars correspond to 30 μm in A andB.

Rapid image acquisition at 2-s intervals in other experiments (n = 5) revealed no rapid mitochondrial motion (data not shown).Vertical scale bar in the first panel corresponds to 15 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Comparison of MitoTracker staining with calreticulin immunofluorescence in an oligodendrocyte process.Live cells were incubated with 500 nm MitoTracker in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, fixed, and processed for immunocytochemistry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 42 serial optical sections (every 0.09 μm in the z-dimension) obtained by digital EPR restoration were rendered into a three-dimensional voxel as shown in A and B.

https://openalex.org/W1667902255,"During development and differentiation, cellular phenotypes are stably propagated through numerous cell divisions. This epigenetic 'cell memory' helps to maintain stable patterns of gene expression. DNA methylation and the propagation of specific chromatin structures may both contribute to cell memory. There are two impediments during the cell cycle that can hinder the inheritance of specific chromatin configurations: first, the pertinent structures must endure the passage of DNA-replication forks in S phase; second, the chromatin state must survive mitosis, when chromatin condenses, transcription is turned off, and almost all double-stranded DNA-binding proteins are displaced. After mitosis, the previous pattern of expressed and silent genes must be restored. This restoration might be governed by mass action, determined by the binding affinities and concentrations of individual components. Alternatively, a subset of factors might remain bound to mitotic chromosomes, providing a molecular bookmark to direct proper chromatin reassembly. Here we analyse DNA at transcription start sites during mitosis in vivo and find that it is conformationally distorted in genes scheduled for reactivation but is undistorted in repressed genes. These protein-dependent conformational perturbations could help to re-establish transcription after mitosis by 'marking' genes for re-expression."

These proteins exhibit some sequence homology. TheEscherichia coli genome contains three genes with sequence homology to nifS. We have cloned the gene mapped at 63.4 min in the chromosome and have expressed, purified to homogeneity, and characterized the gene product. The enzyme comprises two identical subunits with 401 amino acid residues (M r43,238) and contains pyridoxal 5′-phosphate as a coenzyme. The enzyme catalyzes the removal of elemental sulfur and selenium atoms froml-cysteine, l-cystine,l-selenocysteine, and l-selenocystine to produce l-alanine. Because l-cysteine sulfinic acid was desulfinated to form l-alanine as the preferred substrate, we have named this new enzyme cysteine sulfinate desulfinase. Mutant enzymes having alanine substituted for each of the four cysteinyl residues (Cys-100, Cys-176, Cys-323, and Cys-358) were all active. Cys-358 corresponds to Cys-325 of A. vinelandii NIFS, which is conserved among all NIFS-like proteins and catalytically essential (Zheng, L., White, R. H., Cash, V. L., and Dean, D. R. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 4714–4720), is not required for cysteine sulfinate desulfinase. Thus, the enzyme is distinct from A. vinelandii NIFS in this respect.

NIFS catalyzes the same type of reaction as selenocysteine lyase, but acts on both l-cysteine andl-selenocysteine indiscriminately. The enzyme was named cysteine desulfurase, based on its inherent physiological role. Genes with a sequence similarity to that of nifS have been found not only in diazotrophs but also in non-diazotrophic microorganisms. It has been reported that the nifS-like genes of Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are involved in NAD+ biosynthesis (15Sun D. Setlow P. J.

Not only the amino acid sequence but also the catalytic properties of the enzyme resemble those of A. vinelandii NIFS. We have found that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of pig liver selenocysteine lyase is similar to that ofA. vinelandii NIFS (21Beynon J. Ally A. Cannon M. Cannon F. Jacobson M. Cash V. Dean D.R.

Soda, and N. Esaki, manuscript in preparation. If we assume thatE. coli contains selenocysteine lyase and that the enzyme resembles NIFS, one or both of the other two nifS-like genes may encode selenocysteine lyase(s). Alternatively, the genes may encode new enzymes participating in an unknown metabolism of sulfur or selenium amino acids. We have cloned the nifS-like gene mapped at 63.4 min (18Yamamoto Y. Aiba H.

We have tentatively named it cysteine sulfinate desulfinase. We describe here the characteristics of the enzyme and compare it with other related enzymes such as selenocysteine lyase and NIFS.DISCUSSIONNIFS of A. vinelandii participates in construction of the Fe-S clusters of not only nitrogenase (31Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but also other iron-sulfur proteins such as SoxR (32Hidalgo E. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7269-7272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and FNR (33Green J. Bennett B. Jordan P. Ralph E.T. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) also provides apo-dihydroxy-acid dehydratase with a [4Fe-4S] cluster to reconstitute the enzyme in vitro. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was identical with that deduced from anothernifS-like gene of E. coli (Eco1 in TableIII). This gene, together with anifU-like gene, forms a unique gene cluster, which is similar to that found for nifS of Anabaena sp. (34Mulligan M.E. Haselkorn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19200-19207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jackman D.M. Mulligan M.E. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2235-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Lyons E.M. Thiel T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1570-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three nifS-like genes have been demonstrated also in the genome of Haemophilus influenzae, and a similar gene cluster occurs around the Hin1 gene (Table III) of the genome. Therefore, Eco1 and Hin1 probably participate in construction of the Fe-S clusters of iron-sulfur proteins, in the same manner as NIFS ofA. vinelandii. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 also contains three nifS-like genes. However, we found no such gene organization around it. Similarly, none of the cysteine sulfinate desulfinase genes and the third nifS-like gene (Eco2 in Table III) of E. coli form such gene clusters. The same is true for the other nifS-like genes of H. influenzae (Hin2 and Hin3). Therefore, these NIFS-like proteins probably have biochemical functions different from those of Eco1, Hin1, and A. vinelandii NIFS.Table IIINIFSs and NIFS-like proteinsSourceAbbreviationAccessionLengthRef.A. vinelandiiAviP053413-aSWISS-PROT.402(21Beynon J.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 38Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that NIFS and isopenicillin-N-epimerase evolved from the common ancestral protein for the aminotransferases of these classes (37Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 38Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).We have found that NIFS family proteins are classified into two groups, I and II, according to their sequence similarities. The two groups are clearly distinct from each other in the regions named a,b, c, and d (Fig.3). Average sequence similarities of cysteine sulfinate desulfinase to Group I and II members were 23 and 37%, respectively. The similarity relationship among NIFS family proteins is shown in a phylogenetic tree (Fig.4), which also indicates that the proteins are classified into two major groups. The proteins Cel, Lde, Bsu, and Ssp3 are far from the others, but are close to the members of Group I than to the Group II proteins.We have shown that selenocysteine lyase from C. freundii is quite different from the pig liver enzyme in various physicochemical properties (11Chocat P. Esaki N. Tanizawa K. Nakamura K. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 669-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid compositions of pig liver selenocysteine lyase (PIG), cysteine sulfinate desulfinase (CSD), A. vinelandii NIFS (Avi), andE. coli NIFS-like protein (Eco1) resemble each other, but are distinct from that of selenocysteine lyase from C. freundii (CFR) (Fig. 5). Therefore, the latter enzyme probably belongs to a different family of proteins.Figure 5Comparison of the amino acid compositions of selenocysteine lyase and NIFS family proteins. The amino acid compositions of selenocysteine lyases were obtained from the previous report (11Chocat P. Esaki N. Tanizawa K. Nakamura K. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 669-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Those of NIFS family proteins were calculated from the amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the genes. Histograms show the amino acid compositions: Avi,A. vinelandii NIFS; Eco1, E. coliNIFS-like protein; CSD, cysteine sulfinate desulfinase;PIG, pig liver selenocysteine lyase; CFR,C. freundii selenocysteine lyase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The NIFS-like protein from E. coli and NIFS from A. vinelandii have common characteristics; both contain essential cysteinyl residues at the active sites. The thiol group presumably attacks as a nucleophile the sulfur atom of the substrate, cysteine, to form the intermediate, enzyme-bound cysteinyl persulfide (14Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 20Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). By contrast, no cysteinyl residue of cysteine sulfinate desulfinase is essential for catalysis. The cysteine sulfinate desulfinase reaction is assumed to proceed through direct release of elemental selenium or sulfur atom from the substrate, selenocysteine or cysteine. It has been assumed that formation of the enzyme-bound cysteinyl persulfide is crucial to deliver sulfur atoms efficiently to iron-sulfur proteins. If this is the case, cysteine sulfinate desulfinase will not be related metabolically to the formation of Fe-S clusters, although sulfur atoms produced from cysteine by the enzyme are probably incorporated into iron-sulfur proteins with low efficiency in the same manner as observed for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A (EC 4.2.99.8),O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase B (EC 4.2.99.8), and β-cystathionase (EC 4.4.1.8) (39Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Miller T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16053-16067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fact that theK m value of cysteine sulfinate desulfinase for cysteine is high also suggests that cysteine is not the physiological substrate of the enzyme.The irreversible inactivation of PLP enzymes by β-chloroalanine has been shown to proceed through modification of the enzyme-bound PLP with nascent α-aminoacrylate formed from β-chloroalanine (40Badet B. Roise D. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5188-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 41Roise D. Soda K. Yagi T. Walsh C.T.

Cysteine sulfinate desulfinase catalyzes the same type of reaction as do selenocysteine lyase, aspartate β-decarboxylase, and kynureninase. All these enzymes except cysteine sulfinate desulfinase are inactivated by β-chloroalanine (10Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Tate S.S. Relyea N.M. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 5016-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 44Kishore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10669-10674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nascent α-aminoacrylate is probably released from the active site of cysteine sulfinate desulfinase much more quickly than from those of the other enzymes. Alternatively, α-aminoacrylate may be hydrolyzed quickly to pyruvate and ammonia, and so the enzyme can escape from modification with α-aminoacrylate.In mammals, cysteine is oxidized by cysteine dioxygenase (EC1.13.11.20) to form cysteine sulfinic acid, which is decarboxylated to form hypotaurine by cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.29). cDNAs for cysteine dioxygenase (45Hosokawa Y. Matsumoto A. Oka J. Itakura H. Yamaguchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase (46Reymond I. Sergeant A. Tappaz M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were cloned and sequenced. We found no sequences similar to those of the cDNAs in the whole genomic sequence ofE. coli K-12. If E. coli has a cysteine dioxygenase, it will have little sequence similarity to the mammalian enzyme. Alternatively, if no cysteine dioxygenase occurs in E. coli, the cysteine desulfination may be a side function of the enzyme with no metabolic relevance. Aspartate β-decarboxylase and aspartate aminotransferase also use cysteine sulfinate as a good substrate and desulfinate it (29Soda K. Novogrodsky A. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1450-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 43Tate S.S. Relyea N.M. Meister A.

Whatever the physiological function of cysteine sulfinate desulfinase is, this is the first enzyme in Group II whose catalytic function has been clarified (Fig. 4). Other proteins of this group probably have a similar catalytic function to cysteine sulfinate desulfinase.

The plasma glucose concentration was reduced by 25 ± 3% and 37 ± 4% in mice with one or two extra copies of the gene locus, respectively. The basis for the hypoglycemic phenotype was determined using metabolic tracer techniques in chronically cannulated, conscious mice with one extra GK gene copy. Under basal conditions (6-h fasted) transgenic mice had a lower blood glucose concentration (−12 ± 1%) and a slightly higher glucose turnover rate (+8 ± 3%), resulting in a significantly higher glucose clearance rate (+21 ± 2%). Plasma insulin levels were not different, suggesting that increased glucose clearance was due to augmented hepatic, not islet, GK gene expression. Under hyperglycemic clamp conditions the transgenic mice had glucose turnover and clearance rates similar to the controls, but showed a lower plasma insulin response (−48 ± 5%). Net hepatic glycogen synthesis was markedly elevated (+360%), whereas skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis was decreased (−40%). These results indicate that increased GK gene dosage leads to increased hepatic glucose metabolism and, consequently, a lower plasma glucose concentration. Increased insulin secretion was not observed, even though the transgene is expressed in islets, because hypoglycemia causes a down-regulation in islet GK content (Niswender, K.

The loss of one functional GK allele leads to an early onset, but relatively mild hyperglycemia that is due, at least in part, to decreased activity of GK in the pancreatic β cell.

Less is known about the role of altered hepatic GK gene expression in MODY-2, even though GK activity has long been thought to be a key determinant of hepatic glucose usage (2Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 647-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using heterozygous GK null mice have been helpful, but only provide insights into the effects of diminished GK expression. For this reason, the effects of increased GK gene expression in the liver have also been studied in both transgenic mice and primary hepatocytes. In transgenic mice, increased hepatic GK causes hypoglycemia (11Hariharan N. Farrelly D. Hagan D. Hillyer D. Arbeeny C. Sabrah T. Treloar A. Brown K. Kalinowski S. Mookhtiar K.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas in primary heptocytes increased GK leads to both increased glycolysis and glycogen synthesis (13O'Doherty R.M.

Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar,16Magnuson M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The differential, tissue-specific regulation of GK gene expression is thought to be an essential component of this feedback loop (16Magnuson M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The liver can be either a net consumer or net producer of glucose, as determined in large part by the concentrations of insulin and glucagon in the portal blood (17Hers H.-G. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1990; 13: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Pagliassotti M.J. Horton T.J. Pagliassotti M.J. Davis S.N. Cherrington A.D.

In turn, the secretion of pancreatic hormones depends on the plasma glucose concentration, which is affected in part by the status of the liver. In liver, GK gene transcription is stimulated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon (20Iynedjian P.B. Pilot P.R. Nouspikel T. Milburn J.L. Quaade C. Hughes S. Ucla C. Newgard C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Enzyme Regul. 1992; 32: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the islet, GK gene transcription is thought to be largely constitutive, although glucose modulates islet GK content, probably by directly affecting the half-life of the enzyme (25Liang Y.

The induction of hepatic genes by glucose has been found to require GK, suggesting that GK gene expression has both catalytic and regulatory functions in the liver. Given the complex and interdependent factors involved in the regulation of both islet and hepatic GK, it is difficult to accurately predict the in vivo ramifications of altered GK gene expression from in vitro model systems.To further understand the effect of physiologically relevant variations in GK gene copy number on glucose homeostasis, we studied whole body glucose metabolism in mice containing a GK gene locus transgene (1Niswender K.D.

Using this experimental design, we were able to determine the effect on the plasma glucose concentration and hepatic glucose metabolism of one and two additional GK gene copies. These studies clearly revealed the reciprocal relationship between GK gene copy number and blood glucose concentration, the high control strength that GK gene expression has on blood glucose homeostasis, and the importance of feedback interactions between the liver and islet.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGK Gene Locus Transgenic MiceThe animals used in this study contain an 83-kilobase pair GK gene locus transgene inserted by pronuclear DNA microinjection into B6D2 F1 hybrid mice. Previous studies have shown there is one copy of the transgene per haploid genome, located on the X chromosome (1Niswender K.D. Postic C. Jetton T.L. Bennett B.D. Piston D.W. Efrat S. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22564-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All studies were performed using female animals from line 37 that were either heterozygous or homozygous for the transgene allele. Controls were non-transgenic animals of similar genetic background generated from within the same mouse colony. Only non-obese animals weighing 25–30 g were studied. Mice were housed either in a barrier facility or individual filtered units, fed standard mouse chow (Purina Mills, Inc.), and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle.Glucose Tolerance TestMice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (70 μg/g body weight), and blood was sampled from the retro-orbital sinus for glucose tolerance testing in a simple two-point protocol. Base-line samples were taken ∼45 min after induction of anesthesia to allow metabolic fluctuations to return to base-line levels. Glucose was then administered at 1.5 mg/g body weight by intraperitoneal injection, and the second blood sample was obtained 20 min later, corresponding to the peak glucose excursion. Plasma glucose concentrations were determined with a Beckman Glucose Analyzer 2.In Vivo Glucose KineticsAnimal PreparationThe kinetics of glucose metabolism were studied in chronically cannulated, conscious mice. Cannulae were surgically implanted 4–5 days prior to experimentation. Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (70 μg/g body weight, intraperitoneal). Cannulae were surgically implanted into the right jugular vein and the left carotid artery, externalized in the interscapulum and sealed (details available on request). The arterial cannula was used for sampling well mixed arterial blood from which tracer and metabolite measurements were made. The venous cannula was used to infuse tracer and glucose. Body weight, hematocrit, general appearance, and intra-experimental physiological responses were used as indices of health.Experimental ProceduresControl and heterozygous transgenic (3 GK gene copies) mice were fasted for 6 h prior to experimentation. The experimental protocol was 220 min in duration and consisted of a 100-min equilibration period (−100 to 0 min) followed by a 120-min experimental period (0–120 min). A 2-μCi bolus of tracer ([3-3H]glucose, NEN Life Science Products) was given at −100 min, followed by a constant infusion at 0.04 μCi/min for the duration of the study. Samples for tracer and insulin determinations were taken every 30 min starting at −30 min. The blood glucose concentration was measured at −30, 0, 30, and every 15 min thereafter using a Hemocue blood glucose meter (Hemocue, Mission Viejo, CA). The values obtained from the Hemocue device were 20% higher than values of a plasma glucose assay. Red cells were washed with saline and infused back into the animals to prevent anemia. A 50% glucose solution, infused at a variable rate, was used to maintain hyperglycemia in the hyperglycemic clamp studies. In total, ∼400 μl of blood/animal was sampled and 300–800 μl of solutions infused. The experiments were terminated at 120 min, when the animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and the abdomen was opened. Livers were removed within 30 s, and hindlimb muscle was removed within 2 min of anesthesia; both tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately upon removal. A separate set of animals were killed in the same fashion at the 0-min time point for base-line glycogen assessment. Plasma samples for [3H]glucose determinations were deproteinized with Ba(OH)2 and ZnSO4 and dried to eliminate tritiated water. The glucose turnover rate (mg/kg-min) was calculated as the rate of tracer infusion (dpm/min) divided by the corrected plasma glucose specific activity (dpm/mg) per kg body weight of the mouse. The concentration of plasma insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay using a rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit from Linco Research (St. Louis, MO). The binding reactions were modified to perform the assay on 10 μl of plasma. Liver and skeletal muscle glycogen content were assayed as described (36Keppler D. Decker K. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 11-18Google Scholar). Liver glycogen depletion was determined by subtracting the glycogen content at the end of the study from the basal hepatic glycogen content of a separate set of animals. Lactate was measured as described (37Noll F. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 582-588Google Scholar) using 20 μl of deproteinized plasma solution (2 μl of plasma). Plasma non-esterified fatty acids were measured using 1–3 μl of plasma with a NEFA C kit from Wako Pure Chemical Industries.Northern AnalysisNorthern blot analysis was performed as described (1Niswender K.D.

A 1.8-kilobase pair PstI fragment from the rat cDNA PK G4 (38Lone Y.-C. Simon M.-P. Kahn A. Marie J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was used as a probe for L-PK mRNA. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) probe was a 569-bp fragment spanning exons 1–4 of the mouse PEPCK cDNA provided by R. Chalkley (Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University). The cyclophilin control probe was a ∼700-bpHindIII-EcoRI fragment from a rat cDNA plasmid (39Danielson P.E.

Statistical significance was determined by Student'st test. Differences are reported as statistically significant at an α value of 0.05. For the metabolic studies, values for the last 60 min of each protocol were averaged to summarize each experiment.

Diabetes. 1990; 39: 647-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The prediction, over a decade ago, that diminished GK activity would cause diabetes (3Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Am. J.

The loss of one functional GK allele leads to an early onset, but relatively mild hyperglycemia that is due, at least in part, to decreased activity of GK in the pancreatic β cell. This causes an increase in the glucose set point and attenuates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (6Bali D. Svetlanov A. Lee H.-W. Fusco-DeMane D. Leiser M. Li B. Barzilai N. Surana M. Hou H.

Less is known about the role of altered hepatic GK gene expression in MODY-2, even though GK activity has long been thought to be a key determinant of hepatic glucose usage (2Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 647-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using heterozygous GK null mice have been helpful, but only provide insights into the effects of diminished GK expression. For this reason, the effects of increased GK gene expression in the liver have also been studied in both transgenic mice and primary hepatocytes. In transgenic mice, increased hepatic GK causes hypoglycemia (11Hariharan N. Farrelly D. Hagan D. Hillyer D. Arbeeny C. Sabrah T. Treloar A. Brown K. Kalinowski S. Mookhtiar K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 11-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ferre T. Riu E. Bosch F. Valera A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas in primary heptocytes increased GK leads to both increased glycolysis and glycogen synthesis (13O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gomex-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,14Agius L. Peak M.

Both the liver and islet, key sites of GK gene expression, participate in a feedback loop that is necessary for maintaining euglycemia (15Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar,16Magnuson M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The differential, tissue-specific regulation of GK gene expression is thought to be an essential component of this feedback loop (16Magnuson M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The liver can be either a net consumer or net producer of glucose, as determined in large part by the concentrations of insulin and glucagon in the portal blood (17Hers H.-G. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1990; 13: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Pagliassotti M.J. Horton T.J. Pagliassotti M.J. Davis S.N. Cherrington A.D.

Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), as well as the plasma glucose level itself. In turn, the secretion of pancreatic hormones depends on the plasma glucose concentration, which is affected in part by the status of the liver. In liver, GK gene transcription is stimulated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon (20Iynedjian P.B. Pilot P.R. Nouspikel T. Milburn J.L. Quaade C. Hughes S. Ucla C. Newgard C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7838-7842Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Magnuson M.A. Andreone T.L. Printz R.L. Koch S. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, GK activity in liver can be acutely inhibited through interactions with the GK regulatory protein (GKRP) (22Toyoda Y. Miwa I. Kamiya M. Ogiso S. Nonogaki T. Aoki S. Okuda J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J.

Enzyme Regul. 1992; 32: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the islet, GK gene transcription is thought to be largely constitutive, although glucose modulates islet GK content, probably by directly affecting the half-life of the enzyme (25Liang Y. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16863-16866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Liang Y. Najafi H. Smith R.M. Zimmerman E.C. Magnuson M.A. Tal M. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 792-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Metabolic flux in the liver reflects the net activities of several pathways. Some of the rate-determining enzymes in these pathways are regulated at the transcriptional level by the metabolism of glucose itself, presumably through a glycolytic intermediate (27Towle H.C. Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate response elements have been identified in the genes for L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) (28Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

The induction of hepatic genes by glucose has been found to require GK, suggesting that GK gene expression has both catalytic and regulatory functions in the liver. Given the complex and interdependent factors involved in the regulation of both islet and hepatic GK, it is difficult to accurately predict the in vivo ramifications of altered GK gene expression from in vitro model systems. To further understand the effect of physiologically relevant variations in GK gene copy number on glucose homeostasis, we studied whole body glucose metabolism in mice containing a GK gene locus transgene (1Niswender K.D."
https://openalex.org/W1964224572,"Rubredoxin-oxygen oxidoreductase (ROO) is the final component of a soluble electron transfer chain that couples NADH oxidation to oxygen consumption in the anaerobic sulfate reducerDesulfovibrio gigas. It is an 86-kDa homodimeric flavohemeprotein containing two FAD molecules, one mesoheme IX, and one Fe-uroporphyrin I per monomer, capable of fully reducing oxygen to water. EPR studies on the native enzyme reveal two components with g values at ∼2.46, 2.29, and 1.89, which are assigned to low spin hemes and are similar to the EPR features of P-450 hemes, suggesting that ROO hemes have a cysteinyl axial ligation. At pH 7.6, the flavin redox transitions occur at 0 ± 15 mV for the quinone/semiquinone couple and at −130 ± 15 mV for the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple; the hemes reduction potential is −350 ± 15 mV. Spectroscopic studies provided unequivocal evidence that the flavins are the electron acceptor centers from rubredoxin, and that their reduction proceed through an anionic semiquinone radical. The reaction with oxygen occurs in the flavin moiety. These data are strongly corroborated by the finding that rubredoxin and ROO are located in the same polycistronic unit of D. gigas genome.

For the first time, a clear role for a rubredoxin in a sulfate-reducing bacterium is presented. Despite the fact that they are still being considered asstrict anaerobes, sulfate reducing bacteria when exposed to oxygen are capable of surviving (1Diling W. Cypionka H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 71: 123-128Google Scholar, 2Marschall C. Frenzel P. Cypionka H. Arch.

In the presence of oxygen, the sulfate reducer Desulfovibrio gigas, uses internal reserves of polyglucose, which is metabolized by the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway thus generating NADH and ATP (3Santos H. Fareleira P. Xavier A.V. Chen L. Liu M.-Y. LeGall J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 195: 551-557Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this bacterium a three-component soluble electron transfer chain couples NADH oxidation with oxygen reduction to water, allowing simultaneously for NAD+ regeneration and oxygen utilization.

Santos H. Xavier A.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), as shown in Scheme I. NRO, the first component of this pathway, contains two subunits of 27 and 32 kDa and is a flavoprotein containing four flavin groups (FMN and FAD) per molecule with reduction potentials (Flox/Flred) of −295 and −325 mV, at pH 7.6. This NADH oxidase reduces D. gigas Rd, a 6-kDa iron protein, with a reduction potential of 0 ± 5 mV. NRO is highly specific toward this redox protein (5Chen L. Lui M.-Y. LeGall J. Liu Fareleira P. Santos H. Xavier A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). D. gigas desulforedoxin (8Moura I. Bruschi M. LeGall J. Moura J.J.G. Xavier A.V. Biochem.

Biochem. 1993; 216: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), despite the similarity between the reduction potentials of these proteins. D. gigas Rd was also found to be necessary for the coupling of NRO to the final component of the chain, ROO (7Chen L. Liu M.-Y. LeGall J. Fareleira P. Santos H. Xavier A.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This enzyme can be seen as a true terminal oxidase since it is capable of catalyzing the four-electron reduction of oxygen to water without the formation of partially reduced oxygen species (7Chen L. Liu M.-Y. LeGall J. Fareleira P. Santos H. Xavier A.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is an 86-kDa homodimeric flavohemeprotein, containing two FAD and two distinct hemes per monomer. These hemes are of unusual types: uroporphyrin I and a noncovalently bound derivative of mesoheme IX (7Chen L. Liu M.-Y. LeGall J. Fareleira P. Santos H. Xavier A.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Timkovich R. Burkhalter R.S. Xavier A.V. Chen L. LeGall J. Bioorg. Chem. 1994; 22: 284-293Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Finding the type I Fe-uroporphyrin isomer, so far considered as a non-metabolite that accumulates in some genetically linked porphyrias, in a physiologically active enzyme is unprecedented and raises the possibility that uroporphyrin I may be of physiological importance in other organisms. Preliminary studies of this system suggested the involvement of rubredoxin in a physiological reaction in a strict anaerobe (7Chen L. Liu M.-Y. LeGall J. Fareleira P. Santos H. Xavier A.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, its direct reaction with the terminal oxidase remained to be demonstrated. In the present study, the redox centers of this so far unique enzyme are characterized spectroscopically as well as in terms of their reduction potentials. The electron transfer between the components of D. gigas oxygen-utilizing pathway is probed by EPR and visible spectroscopy. Unequivocal spectroscopic evidence for the direct involvement of Rd in the electron transfer to ROO is provided. Also, using genetic approaches, we show that the Rd is located in the same polycistronic unit of the ROO coding region. D. gigas (ATCC 19364) was grown as described previously (12LeGall J. Mazza G. Dragoni N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 99: 385-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain LE 392, and E. coli P2 392 were used to screen the genomic library and in the purification of the recombinant positive phages. Competent cells of E. coli XL2-Blue Cells (Stratagene) and/or E. coli TOP 10F′ (Invitrogen), prepared according to standard protocols (13Thoenes U. Flores O.L. Neves A. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J.J. Huber R. Romão M.J. LeGall J. Rodrigues-Pousada R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), were used to transform the DNA fragments subcloned into the polylinker of the plasmid pZErOTM-1 (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA isolated fromD. gigas was extracted as described (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1995Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the plasmid purification kit Qiagen (Diagen). Degenerate primers (5′-ATGCARGCRACRAARATHAT-3′ and 5′-TTRTAYGTYGTYCCCATYGG-3′) of both extremities of the amino acid sequence corresponding to the N terminus of ROO were used to amplify genomic DNA. The polymerase chain reaction cycling conditions were: 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 30 s followed by 30 cycles at 92 °C for 30 s, 48 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and finally 72 °C for 10 min. The reaction product with 106 base pairs was then subcloned in pZErOTM-1 and sequenced (see below). This procedure allowed us to obtain a homologous probe which was labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham). This probe was used to screen a Sau3A1 genomic library from D. gigasconstructed in λ Dash II as vector (Stratagene). Filters were prehybridized and hybridized at 55 °C with 6 × SSC (SSC, 0.15m NaCl, 15 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS (mass/volume), 200 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed using 2 × SSC, or 2 × SSC with 0.2% SDS at the hybridization temperature. The washings were performed at a temperature higher than 55 °C, depending on the intensity of the signal. Positive phages were purified and their DNA isolated according to the technique described as in Ref. 15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. The DNA was then digested withBamHI, and the fragments corresponding to a size of 3.6 kilobases were subcloned into pZErOTM-1. Suitable restriction fragments were subcloned in pZErOTM-1 and sequenced using the Termo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit according to the supplier's instructions (Amersham). This procedure was used to solve the compressions, as the D. gigas genome has a high G + C content (16Sigal N. Senez J.C. Le Gall J. Sebald M. J. Bacteriol. 1963; 85: 1315-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequential deletions were also made using the double-stranded Nested Deletion kit (Pharmacia). D. gigas soluble extract was prepared as described (12LeGall J. Mazza G. Dragoni N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 99: 385-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ROO was purified essentially according to Ref. 7Chen L. Liu M.-Y. LeGall J. Fareleira P. Santos H. Xavier A.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar but an extra purification step was performed after the last gel filtration column. The ROO-containing fraction from this column was dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer and applied on a Pharmacia Mono-Q FPLC column. A 10–500 mmgradient of the same buffer at 0.5 ml min−1 was applied; pure ROO eluted at ∼75 mm ionic strength. Typical yields are 4–7 mg of ROO/kg of cell mass (wet weight).

The protein N-terminal sequence was determined using an Applied Biosystem Model 470A sequenator. Search of protein sequences showing homology with the N terminus was performed at the NCBI using the BLAST network service. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Room temperature ultraviolet/visible spectra were recorded in a Beckman DU-70 spectrometer. Visible redox titrations were performed in a Shimadzu spectrometer (UV 265) equipped with a cell stirring system. Low temperature (77 K) visible spectra were recorded on a DW-2 OLIS spectrophotometer. EPR spectra were recorded as in Ref. 19Teixeira M. Batista R. Gomes C. Mendes J. Pacheco I. Anemuller S.

Myoglobin azide (1.2 mm) was used as a standard (21Bolard J. Garnier A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 263: 535-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were taken in a SPEX Fluorolog 212. ROO (1.5 μm) was titrated anaerobically in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, by stepwise addition of buffered sodium dithionite. The following compounds were used as redox mediators (0.25 μm each): methylene blue (E′0 = 11 mV), indigo tetrasulfonate (E′0 = −30 mV), indigo trisulfonate (E′0 = −70 mV), indigo disulfate (E′0 = −182 mV), antraquinone 2,7-disulfonate (E′0 = −182 mV), safranine (E′0 = −280 mV), neutral red (E′0 = −325 mV), benzyl viologen (E′0 = −359 mV), and methyl viologen (E′0 = −446 mV). The reduction potentials are quoted versus the standard hydrogen electrode. The experimental data were manipulated and analyzed using MATLAB (Mathworks, South Natick, MA) for Windows. Spectral smoothing and optical deconvolution was performed using singular value decomposition in combination with a curve fitting algorithm (22Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The UV-visible spectrum of native ROO is dominated by a Soret band at 416 nm due to the hemes, a flavin contribution in the 460-nm region and a distinctive feature at 587 nm whose origin is unclear (Fig. 1,trace a). The spectra are similar both when recorded at 77 K and at room temperature. A red flavin semiquinone species accumulates transiently during reduction, as detected at 480 and 380 nm (Fig. 1,trace b). In the fully reduced enzyme, α and β bands are present at 551 and 522 nm, respectively (cf. Fig.5 A). Moreover, the Soret nor the 587-nm bands shift (7Chen L. Liu M.-Y. LeGall J. Fareleira P.

The interaction of native ROO with exogenous ligands, such as cyanide, cysteine, dithiothreitol, and mercaptoethanol was studied. However, no spectral changes were observed, even upon rather extensive incubation periods (data not shown).Figure 5Visible redox titration of ROO hemes.

The excitation spectrum, with the emission wavelength at 520 nm, shows bands at 373 and 464 nm with a shoulder at 342 nm. No emission was obtained with excitation at 587 nm.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12842-12848Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since there is a different degree of exposure to the solvent of the isoalloxazine rings in flavodoxins (25Romero A. Caldeira J. LeGall J. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Romão M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and in FNR (26Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriot J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), nothing can be concluded about the flavin environment in ROO on the basis of its fluorescence characteristics. The EPR spectra of ROO present some rather unique characteristics (Fig.3). The spectra are dominated by resonances at g ∼2.46, 2.29, and 1.89, which appear to result from two rhombic components, as deduced from the comparison and theoretical simulations of the spectra obtained from several ROO preparations. The g values and line shapes observed are slightly variable among different sample preparations, but nonetheless the main characteristics are common to all preparations so far studied. These signals are optimally detected at around 40–50 K, but are still observable, without noticeable line broadening due to the increase of the electronic relaxation time, up to at least 200 K. The intensities of these signals also vary from preparation to preparation. A maximum of 2 spins per monomer were determined from double integration of both the experimental and theoretically simulated spectra, obtained under nonsaturating conditions. Due to these values, as well as to the g values observed, which are similar to those of P-450 enzymes (27Lipscomb J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 28Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol.

Pasteur ( Paris ). 1968; 114: 109-115PubMed Google Scholar), these resonances were assigned to the two ROO heme groups. Since the spectral features remain unaltered in a broad temperature range (20–200 K for EPR and 77–298 K for visible spectroscopy), it may be concluded that they are low-spin in this entire temperature range. Two other low intensity resonances are also observed in some samples: a minor component at g ∼ 6, characteristic of high-spin hemes, and a radical type signal at g ∼ 2.0, with a line width of 1.6 mT, identical to those observed in flavin red semiquinones (49Tegoni M. Janot J.M. Labeyrie F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 50Deleted in proofDeleted in proof.Google Scholar). Upon incubation of ROO with NADH, NRO and Rd the intensity of the radical signal at g ∼ 2 increases, which is likely to be due to the stabilized semiquinone radical of the FAD. The rhombic spectra are essentially unaltered, except for an overall line broadening and a slight g value shift (Fig. 3, trace g). These results strongly suggest that the hemes are not reduced by the redox chain NADH/NRO/Rd. Upon reduction with sodium dithionite an EPR silent state is obtained. Although the 587-nm band as well as the intensity of the EPR signals of purified ROO vary slightly among preparations, these variations are not reflected in the catalytic activity of ROO. Preliminary studies were performed in the absence of redox mediators (Fig. 1, only 3 out of 46 spectra are shown). These data show that it is possible to follow independently the flavin and heme centers, that the two flavins are equivalent and have a reduction potential higher than the hemes, and that flavin reduction occurs in two sequential processes through a red anionic type semiquinone intermediate. The reduction potentials of ROO flavins were determined from two independent visible titrations (Fig. 4,panel A). Large spectral changes occur at 460 nm (oxidized flavin decay) and at 380 and 480 nm (appearance and disappearance of the flavin semiquinone). Since absorbance does not change at 416 and 565 nm, the variations of absorbance at 380–416 nm (Fig. 4,panel B) and 460–565 nm (Fig. 4, panel C) were plotted against the redox potential. Fitting the data to two sequential Nernst processes yielded the following reduction potentials: 0 ± 15 mV (Flox/Flsq) and −130 ± 15 mV (Flsq/Flred). Singular value decomposition analysis of the data confirmed these results. The deconvolution of the optical species yielded a spectral component which was assigned to the red flavin semiquinone. The fitted reduction potentials were similar to those obtained by conventional analysis (data not shown). From the reduction potentials determined, the expected intensity of the semiquinone species for a sequential redox process would be 0.88, in good agreement with the theoretical value of 0.73 calculated based upon the extinction coefficients of quinone and red semiquinone at 385 nm (23Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The data previously obtained (11Timkovich R. Burkhalter R.S. Xavier A.V. Chen L. LeGall J. Bioorg. Chem. 1994; 22: 284-293Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) indicated that both the low-spin mesoheme and iron uroporphyrin I have identical α and β bands in the protein, as well as similar pyridine hemochrome spectra. In agreement with this fact, ROO hemes could not be resolved spectroscopically along the redox titration (Fig.5, panel A). Their reduction potential was determined to be −350 ± 10 mV, following the increase in the absorbance of these two bands, in two independent titrations (Fig. 5, panel B). By visible spectroscopy no spectral changes are observed upon anaerobic incubation of ROO with NADH and NRO (Fig. 6,trace a), confirming that ROO is not directly reduced by either NADH or NRO. After addition of oxidized Rd, the ROO flavins are reduced. In a short time period (1 min) after addition, the flavin semiquinone species accumulates (Fig. 6, trace b); this species then decays to the fully reduced flavin, as seen by the complete bleaching at 460 nm and the disappearance of the 380-nm band within the next minutes (Fig. 6, trace c). Further incubation does not result in heme reduction. Adding air-saturated buffer to the mixture causes immediate reoxidation of the flavins. As described above, a similar experiment followed by EPR, showed also that anaerobic incubation of ROO with NRO and Rd does not result in the disappearance of the heme resonances (Fig. 3, trace g), thus providing further evidence for the nonreduction of ROO hemes in these conditions. The previous experiment demonstrates spectroscopically the involvement of Rd in the reduction of ROO, but it does not rule out its possible participation as an effector. To clarify this issue, a set of experiments in which reduced rubredoxin was allowed to react with ROO was performed. Mixing anaerobically Rd with NADH and catalytic amounts of NRO results in complete reduction of Rd within minutes (Fig.7, inset). When this reduced rubredoxin is added to ROO under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 7,trace a), reduction of the flavins occurs, as evaluated by the decrease in absorbance at 460 nm (Fig. 7, trace b). Simultaneously, Rd is reoxidized causing the appearance of a band at 490 nm. Similar experiments, performed using ascorbate reduced Rd and dithionite reduced Rd, without excess of reductant, also showed the reduction of ROO flavins (data not shown). Using a homologous probe prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” several positive phage plaques were isolated from a genomic library of D. gigas. The isolated DNA was analyzed by restriction mapping and Southern blotting (results not shown), and the BamHI fragments were subcloned and sequenced. Fig. 8 A illustrates the genomic organization of Rd and ROO. As can be seen, both coding units are located in the same polycistronic unit. The sequences of Rd and the N-terminal end of ROO are identical to those obtained by chemical procedures (Fig. 8 B). Screening of protein sequence data bases revealed that the ROO N terminus shows high homologies toward a few proteins: two putative flavoproteins from Methanococcus jannaschii (31Bult C.J. White O.

In the case of the protein from M. thermoautotrophicum, toward which the ROO N-terminal end exhibits 56% identity, it is interesting to note that there is evidence for a rubredoxin being encoded in the same operon (33Nölling J. Ishii M. Kock J. Pihl T. Reeve J. Thauer R. Hedderich R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Most striking is the finding of a block of seven residues which is conserved among these proteins: GTTYNAY. The sequence was compared against the Prosite motifs data bank; this block of residues was identified as a potential N-myristoylation site. However, since this block is internal to the sequence and ROO is most likely a fully processed protein, this possibility remains uncertain. Since most of the mentioned proteins contain flavin cofactors, the GTTYNAY sequence could represent a novel consensus motif for the binding of flavins.Figure FS1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) D. gigas rubredoxin-oxygen oxidoreductase, in terms of its cofactors, may be considered as a member of the large superfamily of flavoheme proteins. From that large and heterogeneous family, two broad groups can be derived, based on their reactivity toward oxygen (Table I). Group I includes proteins that are directly involved in reacting or binding dioxygen. It comprises mainly the so-called flavohemoglobins, like the hemoglobin-like protein from E. coli (34Ioannidis N. Cooper C.E. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These soluble proteins have protoheme IX and FAD as cofactors and share domains from the globin and ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase families (37Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7160-7169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their function is still uncertain, but they seem to play a role as oxygen sensors. Another member of this group is the cytochrome P-450 from Bacillus megaterium (P-450 BM3), which presents the unique feature of having in a single polypeptide chain both the heme and the flavin moieties (37Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7160-7169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Group II includes the flavohemeproteins that are not reported to be reactive with oxygen and is somehow more heterogeneous in terms of size and cofactors of its elements. Very interestingly, a member of this group, the rat nitric oxide synthase, was shown to contain a FMN-binding domain which has a strong analogy with the flavodoxins from sulfate reducing bacteria (43Alberta J.A. Andersson L.A. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20467-20473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Deleted in proofDeleted in proof.Google Scholar). However, homologies between the N termini of the flavohemeproteins from both groups and the N terminus from ROO were not found. Nevertheless, the homology of this ROO partial sequence with some flavoproteins in such diverse organisms as methanogens and photosynthetic bacteria is surprising (Fig. 9). Unfortunately, the functions of these last proteins are not yet known.Table IComparison of properties from flavoheme proteinsProteinOrganismMolecular massCofactorsFunctionReferencekDaGroup I: Oxygen reactive flavoheme proteins Rubredoxin-oxygen oxidoreductaseD. gigas86FAD, mesoheme IX Fe-Uroporphyrin ITerminal O2 reductaseThis work Hemoglobin-like protein (Hmp)E. coli44FAD, protoheme IXO2 sensor34Ioannidis N.

It may then be proposed that one or both hemes in ROO are also coordinated to a cysteine residue. Also, the g value shift detected upon incubation with the ROO reductase system (NRO and Rd) is observed when P-450 is mixed with P-450 reductase (28Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Ioannidis N. D'Mello R. Poole R.K. Bioch. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The fact that the electron donor is the one-electron carrier Rd leads necessarily to the formation of a stable semiquinone radical species. Contrary to what is observed for the other flavohemeproteins from Group I, the reaction with oxygen in ROO appears to occur exclusively at the level of the flavins. However, in contrast to most of the oxidases containing flavins, ROO is not reduced by NADH. The low redox potential of ROO hemes (−350 ± 15 mV) when compared with those of the flavins (0 ± 15 mV and −130 ± 15 mV), together with the fact that they are neither reduced by NADH, NRO, and Rd, nor by reduced Rd, and the fact that this does not prevent catalytic activity, suggests that they are absent from reactivity with oxygen. The coupling properties of some redox proteins from D. gigaswith ROO were tested. However, as evaluated by EPR, mixing ROO under hydrogen with either hydrogenase and cytochromec 3 or hydrogenase, cytochromec 3, and the high molecular weight cytochrome does not result in heme reduction. Possibly, the hemes provide a second electron entry point to the enzyme through an unknown electron donor and/or are involved in an as yet undetermined catalytic reaction, such as enzymatic regulation. Very interestingly, both coding units for Rd and ROO are clustered in the same operon (Fig. 8), indicating that they are under the same transcriptional control. In fact, it has been shown that proteins involved in the same metabolic pathway are organized as an operon (47Nielsen A.K. Gerdes K. Degn H. Murrel J.C. Microbioloby. 1996; 142: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,48Yamazaki M. Thorne L. Mikolajczak M. Armentrout R.W. Pollock T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2676-2687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding strongly reinforces the evidence obtained by spectroscopic analysis that reduced rubredoxin is directly involved in electron donation to ROO. The determined redox potentials of ROO flavins are apparently in thermodynamic contradiction with the observations reported here according to which flavins are fully reduced by Rd, which has a reduction potential of ∼0 mV. In fact, in the presence of the complete redox chain (NADH, NRO, Rd, and ROO), there is enough thermodynamic power to reduce the oxidase, but since reduced Rd can also reduce ROO flavins it may be suggested that the interaction of Rd with ROO causes a slight shift on the reduction potentials of either Rd or ROO flavins. This is the first example for a rubredoxin function in sulfate reducing bacteria, despite the fact that they have been known and well characterized for a long time. Examples of physiological pathways in which a clear role for rubredoxin was found are scarce (51Ragsdale S.W. Ljungdahl L.G. DerVartanian D.V. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 1224-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Ruettinger R.T. Griffith G.R. Coon M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).

Nuclear receptors are interesting candidates because they are transcription factors whose activity is ligand-dependent. In the present study we identified the orphan receptor RORα1 as an activator of apoA-I gene transcription. In apoA-I-expressing intestinal Caco-2 cells, overexpression of the RORα1, but not the RORα2 or RORα3 isoforms, increased rat apoA-I gene transcription. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified a functional ROR-responsive element (RORE) in the rat and mouse apoA-I gene promoters, which overlaps with the TATA box. Gel shift experiments indicated that this RORE binds the RORα1 isoform, but not the RORα2 or RORα3 isoforms. Furthermore, compared with wild type mice, apoA-I mRNA levels were significantly lower in small intestines of staggerer mice homozygous for a deletion in the RORα gene. In addition, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the expression of RORα in small intestinal epithelium and in Caco-2 cells. These data indicate a novel, physiological role for RORα1 in the regulation of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and possibly in the development of metabolic diseases, such as atherosclerosis.

Furthermore, compared with wild type mice, apoA-I mRNA levels were significantly lower in small intestines of staggerer mice homozygous for a deletion in the RORα gene. In addition, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the expression of RORα in small intestinal epithelium and in Caco-2 cells. These data indicate a novel, physiological role for RORα1 in the regulation of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and possibly in the development of metabolic diseases, such as atherosclerosis. Results from several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; apo, apolipoprotein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; ROR, retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor; RORE, ROR-responsive element; TK, thymidine kinase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus. and its major protein component, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, are inversely correlated to the development of coronary artery disease (1Miller N.E.

In addition, studies in transgenic mice and rabbits have shown that overexpression of the human apoA-I gene results in increased plasma HDL and apoA-I concentrations and confers protection against atherogenesis (5Rubin E.M.

Reddick R.L. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, a thorough knowledge of the factors controlling apoA-I production and metabolism is essential to understand the causes of hypo-α-lipoproteinemia, the most common lipoprotein abnormality in patients with coronary artery disease (8Breslow J.L. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. I. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 1251-1266Google Scholar). To identify factors regulating apoA-I gene expression, we focussed our attention on various members of the superfamily of nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors are transcription factors, which upon activation by specific ligands bind to response elements located in the regulatory regions of target genes and thereby modulate their transcriptional activity (9Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark E. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). As such nuclear receptors translate signals coming from the environment into changes in gene expression and are therefore interesting targets for pharmacological intervention. The largest class of nuclear receptors is constituted by the orphan receptors, for which no ligands have yet been identified (10Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the physiological functions of most of the orphan receptors are not or only partly known, and target genes remain to be identified. Previous studies have shown that apoA-I gene expression is under control of various activators/ligands of nuclear receptors, such as glucocorticoid and thyroid hormones, estrogens, retinoids, and the hypolipidemic fibrate drugs, which are potent PPARα activators (11Staels B.

The ROR (retinoic acid receptor-related orphanreceptor; also termed RZR) orphan receptors (16Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G.

RORs bind as monomers to response elements consisting of a 6-bp AT-rich sequence preceding the half-core PuGGTCA motif (16Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 20Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol.

Due to alternative splicing and promoter usage, the RORα gene gives rise to 4 isoforms, α1, α2, α3, and RZRα (16Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G.

Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent report identified the monogenic mutant staggerer (sg/sg) mice as deficient for RORα expression, due to a deletion in the gene of RORα (22Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L. van Berkel V. Birren B.W. Krugiyak L. Lander E.S. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). This deletion in the RORα gene in sg/sg mice prevents the translation of the putative ligand-binding domain, thereby presumably disrupting the normal function of this transcription factor (22Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L. van Berkel V. Birren B.W. Krugiyak L. Lander E.S. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). staggerer mice display a defect in the development of the Purkinje cells resulting in a severe neurological disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia (23Sidman R.L. Lane P.W. Dickie M.M. Science. 1962; 137: 610-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, at present it is unknown whether RORα deficiency in these mice also results in metabolic abnormalities. In the present study, we identified RORα as a positive regulator of rat and mouse apoA-I gene transcription. Furthermore, we show that the expression of the apoA-I gene in the intestine of homozygousstaggerer mice is severely repressed. Our data indicate a novel function for RORα as a factor regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. PCR amplification and cloning of the rat apoA-I gene promoter fragments into the pBLCAT5 promoterless expression vector were described previously (24Saladin R. Vu-Dac N. Fruchart J.-C. Auwerx J. Staels B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the RORE was accomplished using the oligonucleotide 5′-CAC ACA TAT ATA GGC AGG GAA GAA GA-3′ as a mutagenic primer on single-stranded DNA templates according to Kunkel (25Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The rat wild-type (5′-GAT CCA CAC ATA TAT AGG TCA GGG AAG AAG A-3′), mutant (5′-GAT CCA CAC ATA TAT AGG CAG GGA AGA AGA-3′), and mouse (5′-GAT CCA CAC ATA TAT AGA CCA GGG AAG AAG A-3′) apoA-I RORE and the consensus RORE (5′-GAT CCA GCT TAG AAT GTA GGT CAA-3′) (20Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) oligonucleotides were cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter of pBLCAT4 (26Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Identity of all clones was verified by sequence analysis. Human colon carcinoma Caco-2 and African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure using 5 μg of reporter vector and 2 μg of the various RORα expression vectors (kind gifts from Dr. V. Giguère) or empty pCMX plasmid vector. Each well was transfected with the same amount of DNA. CAT assays were performed exactly as described previously (27Bossu J.P. Chartier F.L. Vu-Dac N. Fruchart J.C. Laine B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 822-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A RSV-driven β-galactosidase expression vector (1 μg) was included as a control for transfection efficiency. Autoradiographs of CAT assays were quantified by scintillation counting, and results were normalized for transfection efficiency. Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least 3 times. The pCMX-based RORα expression plasmids were in vitro transcribed using T7 polymerase and subsequently translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate as directed by the manufacturer (Promega). DNA-protein binding assays were conducted as described (28Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Laine B. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31012-31018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above described rat and mouse apoA-I and the consensus RORE double-stranded oligonucleotides (20Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ32P]ATP. For competition experiments, the indicated amounts of cold oligonucleotide were included just before labeled oligonucleotide was added. staggerer(sg/sg) mutant mice (10 weeks of age) were obtained by crossing known heterozygotes (+/sg) and identifying homozygous offspring by their clinical ataxia. Mice were housed 2–5 per cage and maintained at 25 °C in a temperature-controlled room with a 12-h light-dark cycle. Water and food were given ad libitum. The small intestine was removed and divided in two sections of equal length (proximal and distal), opened longitudinally, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA extractions from rat and mouse intestinal epithelium and Caco-2 cells, Northern blot hybridizations, and measurement of apoA-I mRNA levels were performed as described (11Staels B. Auwerx J. Chan L. van Tol A. Rosseneu M. Verhoeven G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A β-actin probe was used as a control probe (29Cleveland D.W. Lopata M.A. McDonald R.J. Cowan M.J. Rutter W.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1980; 20: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). For analysis of RORα expression, total RNA (100 ng) was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers and superscript reverse transcriptase. RORα mRNA was subsequently PCR-amplified (35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C) using as primers the sense oligonucleotide 5′-GTC AGC AGC TTC TAC CTG GAC-3′ and the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-GTG TTG TTC TGA GAG TGA AAG GCA CG-3′ which are conserved between human and mouse (16Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 22Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L. van Berkel V. Birren B.W. Krugiyak L. Lander E.S. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment spans the deleted region in mouse, rat, and human RORα coding sequence, yielding a fragment of the expected size of 482 and 359 bp in wild type and staggerer mice, respectively. To determine whether apoA-I is a RORα target gene, the rat apoA-I gene promoter was cloned in front of a CAT reporter gene, and co-transfection experiments were performed in the intestinal carcinoma cell line Caco-2, which expresses the apoA-I gene. Co-transfection of a RORα1 expression vector resulted in a more than 7-fold increase of CAT activity driven by a 1-kilobase pair apoA-I gene promoter fragment (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, neither the activities of the promoter-less pBLCAT5 vector or a herpes simplex virus TK promoter-driven CAT vector were induced by RORα1 co-transfection (not shown), indicating that apoA-I promoter transactivation by RORα1 is specific. Upon 5′ deletion of the apoA-I promoter, basal promoter activity dropped significantly in Caco-2 cells, an observation which is concordant with the absence of intestinal expression of an apoA-I transgene driven by the proximal apoA-I promoter (30Rubin E.M. Ishida B.Y. Clift S.M. Krauss R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 31Walsh A. Ito Y. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6488-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, RORα1 overexpression still increased CAT activity approximately 4-fold (Fig. 1 A). Since the RORα gene gives rise to different isoforms, we compared the transactivation potential of the RORα1, -α2, and -α3 isoforms on the smaller rat apoA-I gene promoter construct next. In contrast to RORα1, neither RORα2 nor RORα3 could activate apoA-I gene transcription (Fig. 1 B). These data indicate the presence of a ROR-response element (RORE) in the first 252 bp of the apoA-I gene promoter, which is specific for the RORα1 isoform. In vitro binding site selection experiments have indicated that RORα1 binds preferentially to a half-core AGGTCA nuclear receptor recognition motif preceded by an AT-rich sequence (16Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 20Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although the apoA-I gene promoter A- and C-sites have been shown to bind different members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (28Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Laine B. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31012-31018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ladias J.A.A. Karathanasis S.K. Science. 1991; 251: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 33Chan J.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3380-3389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), none of them are preceded by an AT-rich sequence. However, careful inspection of the apoA-I promoter revealed the presence between nucleotides −21 and −32 of a perfectly conserved AGGTCA half-site preceded by the sequence ATATAT, which coincidently overlaps the TATA box (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether this site mediates the effects of RORα1 on apoA-I gene transcription, we introduced a mutation in the AGGTCA half-core motif, which should inactivate the AGGTCA site without affecting the TATA box function (Fig. 2 A). In contrast to the wild-type (wt) construct, the mutated (mt) construct was no longer activated by RORα1 overexpression in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2, B andC).Figure 2The rat apoA-I gene promoter contains a functional RORE.

C, representative CAT assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the apoA-I RORE could confer ROR responsiveness to a heterologous promoter, the rat apoA-I RORE was cloned in front of the viral TK promoter, and co-transfection experiments were performed in CV-1 cells. The presence of a single copy of the rat apoA-I RORE, both cloned in the sense and antisense directions, resulted in a significant induction of TK promoter activity by RORα1 co-transfection (Fig.3 B). Interestingly, RORα1 overexpression consistently resulted in a more pronounced transactivation of the rat apoA-I RORE (cloned in its natural sense) compared with the previously described optimal RORE consensus sequence (Fig. 3, A and B) (20Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), thereby indicating that the rat apoA-I RORE is a very high affinity RORE (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, overexpression of RORα1 did not activate the mt apoA-I RORE (Fig. 3 B). Since homozygous staggerer mice have been shown to carry a deletion in the RORα gene (22Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L. van Berkel V. Birren B.W. Krugiyak L. Lander E.S. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and may therefore constitute an excellent in vivo model to study the consequences of RORα deficiency on lipoprotein metabolism in general and apoA-I expression in particular, we next compared the putative mouse apoA-I gene promoter RORE sequence to the rat apoA-I and the consensus RORE sequences (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, whereas the AT-rich motif is conserved between the rat and mouse apoA-I gene promoters, two nucleotide differences occur in the AGGTCA motif (Fig.3 A). To determine whether this mouse apoA-I site could function as a RORE, we cloned three copies of the putative mouse apoA-I RORE in front of the TK promoter and performed co-transfection experiments with RORα1 in CV-1 cells. Although less pronounced compared with the rat apoA-I RORE, overexpression of RORα1 resulted in a significant activation of the TK promoter construct driven by three copies of the mouse apoA-I RORE (Fig. 3 C). Next, the binding activity of RORα to the mouse and rat apoA-I ROREs was determined by gel shift analysis and compared with that of the previously identified consensus RORE (20Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). RORα1, but not RORα2 or RORα3, bound to the rat apoA-I RORE (Fig.4, A and B), results which correlate well with the relative transactivation potential of the different RORα isoforms. This binding was specific since it could be competed by excess unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, the rat apoA-I RORE appears to bind RORα1 with higher affinity than the consensus RORE (Fig.4 A). Furthermore, RORα1 clearly binds to the mouse apoA-I RORE (Fig. 4 C), although the affinity of the mouse RORE for RORα1 is clearly lower than that of the rat apoA-I RORE, a fact which correlates well with the relative transactivation of both ROREs by RORα1 (Fig. 3, B and C). These data indicate therefore that although the mouse apoA-I RORE appears to be a lower affinity RORE compared with the rat apoA-I RORE, it may be a functional RORE. These observations prompted us to analyze the physiological role of RORα in the regulation of apoA-I gene expression. Since homozygousstaggerer mice have been shown to be monogenic mutants for the RORα gene (22Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L. van Berkel V. Birren B.W. Krugiyak L. Lander E.S. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), the expression of the apoA-I gene in different parts of the small intestine of these mice was analyzed next. ApoA-I mRNA levels were significantly lower both in proximal and distal small intestines of staggerer mice compared with wild type mice (Fig. 5). As a control, β-actin mRNA levels were similar betweensg/sg and wild-type mice. Finally, since direct regulation of apoA-I expression by RORα requires its expression in the small intestine, reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments were performed on RNA isolated from small intestinal epithelium cells from mice and rats as well as from Caco-2 cells. Using primers complementary to conserved sequences between mouse and human RORα (16Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 22Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L. van Berkel V. Birren B.W. Krugiyak L. Lander E.S. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), a cDNA fragment of the expected size of 482 bp was amplified in rat and mouse epithelial cells as well as in Caco-2 cells, thereby indicating that RORα is expressed in the intestine (Fig. 6). Interestingly, instaggerer mice a truncated cDNA fragment of 359 bp exactly corresponding to the size of the deletion identified in the RORα gene in these mice was amplified (22Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L. van Berkel V. Birren B.W. Krugiyak L. Lander E.S. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These observations warrant further studies in homozygous staggerer mice to determine the role of RORα in the control of HDL metabolism and its possible consequences for atherosclerosis susceptibility in vivo in staggerer mice. Altogether these results clearly indicate that apoA-I is a direct target gene for RORα1 and that its expression in the intestine is under control of RORα1. To our knowledge this is the first RORα target gene with a function in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The selective transactivation and binding of RORα1, but not RORα2 or RORα3, to the apoA-I RORE is in agreement with previous reports, which indicated less restricted RORE binding requirements and higher transactivation potential of RORα1 with respect to RORα2 or RORα3 (16Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, the presence of the reported sequence requirements for RORα2 binding (a T at position −1 and an A at −4 relative to the AGGTCA half-site) in the apoA-I RORE (16Giguère V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 18Carlberg C. van Huijsduijnen R. Staple J.K. DeLamarter J.F. Becker-André M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) contrasts to the absence of RORα2 binding and transactivation on this RORE and suggests that other DNA sequence differences may also contribute to differentiate RORα1 from RORα2 binding. Computer homology searches allowed the identification of ROREs in a variety of genes, such as the human and mouse N-myc proto-oncogene, the mouse cellular retinol-binding protein I, chicken γF-crystallin, rat bone sialoprotein, mouse Purkinje cell protein 2, and human p21WAF1/CIP1 (16Giguère V.

In addition, a RORE has also been identified in the promoter of the 5-lipoxygenase gene, which may mediate the negative regulation of its expression by melatonin, a possible ligand for ROR/RZRα and ROR/RZRβ (38Becker-André M.

However, the involvement of RORα in the down-regulation of this gene by melatonin has not been unequivocally demonstrated (40Steinhilber D. Brungs M. Werz O. Wiesenberg I. Danielsson C. Kahlen J.-P. Nayeri S. Schräder M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7037-7040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Most interesting is the observation that the apoA-I RORE overlaps with the TATA box. It remains to be determined whether RORα1 interacts with the TATA box-binding protein or rather competes for its binding, but its close localization to the TATA box and the requirement of an AT-rich nucleotide stretch for binding suggests that RORα may compete for TATA box-binding protein binding resulting in a transcription initiation complex of higher activity. Although surprising, the identification of a potential similar TATA box overlapping RORE in the rat bone sialoprotein gene (36Schräder M. Danielsson C. Wiesenberg I. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19732-19736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) suggests that RORα may have a more general function as a component of the basal transcription machinery. In conclusion, we have shown that both the mouse and rat apoA-I genes are direct targets for RORα1 and that RORα plays a physiological role in the expression of the apoA-I gene in the intestine. This is the first identification of a RORα target gene which is involved in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. These data suggest a physiological role of the nuclear receptor RORα in the control of lipoprotein metabolism. We acknowledge the technical contribution of I. Pineda-Torra, Y. Delplace, O. Vidal, and B. Derudas. We also thank Dr. V. Giguère for providing the different RORα expression vectors to us."

The enzyme activity was purified to homogeneity from bovine brain as a monomer with aM r of 63,000 and a specific activity of 32 nmol of Pi released per min/mg of protein when assayed in the presence of 10 μm phosphocasein in the absence of lipid. Arachidonic acid stimulated activity 4–14-fold, with half-maximal stimulation at 50–100 μm, when assayed in the presence of a variety of phosphosubstrates including casein, reduced carboxamidomethylated and maleylated lysozyme, myelin basic protein, and histone. Oleic acid, linoleic acid, and palmitoleic acid also stimulated activity; however, saturated fatty acids and alcohol or methyl ester derivatives of fatty acids did not significantly affect activity. The lipid-stimulated phosphatase was identified as the bovine equivalent of protein phosphatase 5 or a closely related homolog by sequence analysis of proteolytic fragments generated from the purified enzyme. When recombinant rat protein phosphatase 5 was expressed as a cleavable glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, the affinity-purified thrombin-cleaved enzyme exhibited a specific activity and sensitivity to arachidonic acid similar to those of the purified bovine brain enzyme. These results suggest that protein phosphatase 5 may be regulated in vivo by a lipid second messenger or another endogenous activator.

Four major types of protein-Ser/Thr phosphatases have been described: PP1, 1The abbreviations used are: PP, protein phosphatase; AA, arachidonic acid; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; RCML, reduced carboxamidomethylated and maleylated lysozyme; MBP, myelin basic protein; CMC, critical micellar concentration; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; pNPP, para-nitrophenyl phosphate; SM-PP1M, smooth muscle myosin light chain phosphatase 1.1The abbreviations used are: PP, protein phosphatase; AA, arachidonic acid; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; RCML, reduced carboxamidomethylated and maleylated lysozyme; MBP, myelin basic protein; CMC, critical micellar concentration; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; pNPP, para-nitrophenyl phosphate; SM-PP1M, smooth muscle myosin light chain phosphatase 1. PP2A, calcineurin, and PP2C. The catalytic subunits of PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes (1Barton G.J. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 3Barford D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 407-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Cloning studies have also revealed several novel protein-Ser/Thr phosphatases related to PP1 and PP2A, the properties and functions of which are not yet understood (2Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In addition to a catalytic subunit, PP1, PP2A, and calcineurin each contain one or more regulatory subunits. Mechanisms regulating the activity of these enzymes include the control of localization and substrate specificity by regulatory subunits; direct phosphorylation; the binding of a second messenger; and inhibition by regulatory domains, subunits, and interacting proteins (2Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Several members of the PP1/PP2A family have been shown to be sensitive to putative lipid second messengers (4Gong M.C. Fuglsang A. Alessi D. Kobayashi S. Cohen P. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol.

Arachidonic acid and several of its lipoxygenase or cytochrome P-450 metabolites have been reported to modulate the activity of a variety of ion channels (9Meves H. Prog. Neurobiol.

Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This suggests that a Ser/Thr phosphatase related to PP1 or PP2A may mediate the effect of some lipids on ion channel activity (14Armstrong D.L. White R.E. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The possibility that a lipid-activated Ser/Thr phosphatase may in turn regulate ion channel function prompted us to look for such an enzyme. In this report, we describe the purification of a fatty acid-stimulated Ser/Thr phosphatase from bovine brain. The purified enzyme contains a single M r 63,000 polypeptide and is identical or closely related to the recently cloned Ser/Thr phosphatase PP5 (15Becker W. Kentrup H. Klumpp S. Schultz J.E.

We also demonstrate that recombinant rat PP5 is similarly activated by the unsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA). Protein phosphatase 5 and its yeast homolog (PPT1) contain a C-terminal catalytic domain that is structurally related to PP2A and PP1 and an N-terminal domain consisting of several tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that is not shared with other members of the PP1/PP2A family (15Becker W.

The stimulation of PP5 in vitro by unsaturated fatty acids suggests that this enzyme may be regulated in vivo and raises the possibility that it is a target for activation by a lipid second messenger or some other endogenous effector. All materials were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was purified from bovine heart (24Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K.R. Strumwasser F.

All steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. Frozen bovine brain cortex (615 g) was thawed and homogenized in a Waring blender with 1.2 liters of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6 (4 °C), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm pepstatin A (buffer A). The homogenization buffer also included 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 40 min, and the supernatant was filtered through glass wool, diluted to 3 liters, and then mixed with 500 ml of DE52 (Whatman) for 90 min. The DE52 was washed until the effluent absorbance at 280 nm was equal to that of the wash buffer, and then bound proteins were eluted with 1 liter of buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. Eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer A and then applied to a 5 × 30-cm DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. The column was eluted with a 1-liter gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl in buffer A (including 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) at a flow rate of 7.5 ml/min. Fractions of 7.5 ml were collected and assayed as described below. A peak of AA-stimulated phosphatase activity eluting at 60 mm NaCl was pooled, dialyzed in buffer A, and then applied to a 2.5 × 18-cm CM-Sepharose CL-6B column and eluted with a 300-ml gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions of 2.5 ml were collected and assayed. A single peak of phosphatase activity eluting at 100 mm NaCl was pooled and diluted with buffer A to contain ∼25 mm NaCl and then loaded onto a 1 × 14-cm heparin-agarose column. The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer A containing 100 mmNaCl and then eluted with a 10-ml gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected at 0.5 ml/min and assayed. Active fractions were pooled and subjected to gel filtration on a 1.5 × 95-cm Sephadex G-100 superfine column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. Standards used to calibrate the column included aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), cytochromec (12.4 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). The column flow rate was 0.1 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected and assayed. Active fractions were pooled and loaded onto a 1.5 × 16-cm α-casein-agarose column. This column was washed and then eluted with a 100-ml gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl in buffer A at 1 ml/min; fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed. A single peak of AA-stimulated phosphatase activity eluting at 140 mm NaCl was pooled and concentrated on a 1-ml heparin-agarose column and then subjected to cation-exchange chromatography on a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 25 °C. The column was washed and eluted with a 110-ml gradient of 0–186 mm NaCl in buffer A (pH 7.6, 25 °C) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected at 4 °C and assayed for phosphatase activity. Pooled fractions were dialyzed against buffer A containing 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (27Maizel J.V. Methods Virol. 1971; 5: 179-246Crossref Google Scholar) using a 4% stacking gel and a 10% resolving gel, and proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue or silver (28Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3738) Google Scholar). Casein, RCML (Life Technologies, Inc.), and lysine-rich histone (type III-S from calf thymus, Sigma) were phosphorylated overnight at 30 °C in a reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 750 μm [γ-32P]ATP (3.5 × 1014 cpm/mol ATP), 5 mg/ml substrate, and 4 μg/ml purified catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (29Sheng Z. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4728-4733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each reaction was terminated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 12% (w/v) and then left on ice for 2 h and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 0.1 mm EGTA at 4 °C. Myelin basic protein (Life Technologies, Inc.) was phosphorylated as described above in a 500-μl reaction, and then the reaction was terminated with 800 μl of ice-cold 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in 20 mmNaH2PO4. The mixture was left for 15 min on ice and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was washed four times; resuspended in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (4 °C); and dialyzed as described above. Kemptide was phosphorylated in the same manner as MBP and purified by binding to phosphocellulose P-81 paper (29Sheng Z. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4728-4733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylase a was phosphorylated as described by Cohen et al. (30Cohen P. Alemany S. Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Strålfors P. Tung H.Y.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 390-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The average stoichiometry of phosphorylation for these substrates (expressed as mol of phosphate/mol of protein) was 0.27 for casein, 0.21 for RCML, 0.2 for histone, 0.96 for MBP, 0.33 for Kemptide, and 0.4 for phosphorylasea. During purification, casein was phosphorylated with 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (3.5 × 1015 cpm/mol ATP) to a stoichiometry of 0.05 mol of phosphate/mol of casein and used to assay column fractions and pools. Phosphatase reactions conducted during purification were carried out for 15 min at 30 °C with 0.6 μm32P-casein in the presence and absence of 50 μm AA (Calbiochem) in 60 mm Tris, pH 7.6 (25 °C), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (buffer B). Reactions were initiated by adding 20 μl of substrate containing lipid or ethanol vehicle to 10 μl of an enzyme sample. Once the phosphatase was purified, the assay conditions were modified slightly. All solutions were pre-equilibrated to room temperature just before assay. Ten microliters of lipid or ethanol vehicle solution were mixed with 10 μl of phosphatase, and then the reaction was immediately initiated by adding 10 μl of substrate and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in buffer B. Reactions were terminated with 100 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 20 μl of 7.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and then microcentrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Reactions with32P-RCML were terminated instead with 100 μl of ice-cold 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Assays using 32P-Kemptide,32P-histone, and 32P-MBP were quenched with 450 μl of 4% (w/v) activated charcoal in 0.6 m HCl, 90 mm Na4P2O7, and 2 mm NaH2PO4 and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Acid-soluble32Pi was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The phosphate released from each substrate was <20% of the total present. The final ethanol concentration in lipid-containing reactions was 0.8–1.7% and had no significant effect on phosphatase activity. The CMCs of lipid solutions in 60 mmTris, pH 7.6 (25 °C), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1.3% ethanol, and a 2 μmconcentration of the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene were determined by fluorescence spectroscopy (31Chattopadhyay A. London E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 408-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Lipids were dispersed by sonication or vigorous vortexing, equilibrated to room temperature, and then incubated with fluorescent probe in the dark for at least 30 min. Fluorescence intensity was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 358 and 430 nm, respectively, on a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fifty micrograms of purified phosphatase were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, resuspended in 8 m urea and 0.4m NH4HCO3, reduced and carboxymethylated (32Stone K.L. Williams K.R. A Practical Guide to Proteins & Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 45-73Google Scholar), and then digested with 1.8 μg of endoproteinase Lys-C (Waco Chemicals) at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (2.1 × 250 mm) using a gradient of 0–30% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 150 μl/min. The amino acid sequences of selected peptides were determined by automated Edman degradation performed with either an Applied Biosystems 470A or 491 gas-phase sequencer. A BLAST search (33Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70319) Google Scholar) was performed to compare the peptide sequences obtained with those in the GenBank™, SwissProt, and PIR data bases. Messenger RNA was isolated from rat GH4C1 cells and used to generate cDNA. The cDNA was then used as a template in polymerase chain reaction together with PP5-specific oligonucleotide primers, and the major polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into theMluI-NotI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega). The 1.5-kilobase pair cDNA containing the entire PP5 coding region was then amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the pCI-PP5 clone as a template. The 5′-sense primer (5′-GACTGGATCCATGGCGATGGCGGAGGGCGAG) and the 3′-antisense primer (5′-GACTGAATTCTTACATCATTCCTAGCTG) utilized in this polymerase chain reaction contained initiation and stop codons, respectively, as well asBamHI and EcoRI restriction linkers. The major product containing the full-length PP5 coding region was then cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pBluescript II (pBII) KS− (Stratagene) and sequenced using an ALFexpress automatic DNA sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to verify its authenticity. To perform bacterial expression, the entire PP5 cDNA was excised from the pBII-PP5 construct using BamHI andEcoRI restriction enzymes and cloned immediately downstream of the GST coding region into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of the pET-21a GST plasmid. 4Constructed as described by Taylor et al. (G. Taylor, Y. Liu, C. Baskerville, and H. Charbonneau, submitted for publication). The newly constructed plasmid, termed pET GST-PP5, was then transformed intoEsherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Bacterial cultures were grown in Luria broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 4 mm MnCl2, and protein expression was induced with 50 μm isopropylthiogalactoside. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm MnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. The GST-PP5 fusion protein was affinity-purified with glutathione-agarose and then treated with thrombin (34Smith D.B. Johnson K.S.

Proteolysis was terminated with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and recombinant PP5 was dialyzed in 50% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6 (4 °C), and 4 mmMnCl2 overnight and then stored at −20 °C. The amino acid sequence of recombinant PP5 is identical to that reported by Becker et al. (15Becker W. Kentrup H. Klumpp S. Schultz J.E. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22586-22592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for four residues (GSGS) remaining at the N terminus after thrombin cleavage. Recombinant PP5 was assayed for para-nitrophenylphosphatase activity in a 50-μl reaction containing 10–150 mm pNPP, 500 ng of enzyme, and 0–40 μm AA in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% ethanol. Aliquots of enzyme were preincubated for 1 min at 30 °C, and then reactions were initiated by adding a mixture of substrate and lipid prewarmed to 30 °C. Control reactions were assayed without enzyme to determine the spontaneous hydrolysis of pNPP at each substrate concentration. Assays were terminated after 15 min with 450 μl of 0.25 n NaOH. Sample absorbance was measured at A 410 to quantitate the release of para-nitrophenolate, after subtracting the appropriate background (29Sheng Z. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4728-4733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic parametersK m and V max were determined by nonlinear regression and Lineweaver-Burk analysis using the computer software program EnzymeKinetics (Trinity Software). When soluble extracts prepared from rat brain were subjected to Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography and fractions were assayed for phosphatase activity using 32P-casein as substrate in the presence of 50 μm AA, a peak of activity eluting at ∼110–125 mm NaCl was observed (data not shown). Its activity ranged from undetectable to very low in the absence of AA. A similar peak of lipid-stimulated phosphatase activity was observed during chromatography of soluble extracts from bovine brain or heart and from rat clonal GH4C1 pituitary cells. After Mono Q ion-exchange chromatography, the lipid-stimulated activity was inhibited >80% by 100 nm okadaic acid, suggesting that it was related to PP1 or PP2A (36Holmes C.F.B. Boland M.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 934-943Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To purify the fatty acid-stimulated phosphatase, a soluble extract was prepared from bovine brain and subjected to batch chromatography on DE52-cellulose, followed by column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, CM-Sepharose CL-6B, heparin-agarose, Sephadex G-100 superfine, α-casein-agarose, and Mono S (Table I). Phosphatase activity was monitored in the presence and absence of 50 μm AA using 32P-casein as a substrate. A single peak of AA-stimulated phosphatase activity eluting at 60 mm NaCl was resolved from the majority of phosphatase activity during chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B. During gel filtration, the lipid-stimulated phosphatase eluted with an apparentM r of 63,000. After Mono S chromatography, the purified phosphatase contained a single M r63,000 band when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with silver (Fig. 1) or Coomassie Blue (data not shown). These results suggested that the lipid-stimulated phosphatase is a monomer of M r63,000 and that it is distinct from PP1 and PP2A, which are typically multisubunit enzymes containing catalytic subunits of 36–37 kDa (1Barton G.J.

https://openalex.org/W2017790908,"The Na,K-ATPase belongs to a family of P-type ion-translocating ATPases sharing homologous catalytic subunits (α) that traverse the membrane several times and contain the binding sites for ATP and cations.

The Na,K-ATPase 1The abbreviation used is: Na,K-ATPase, sodium- and potassium-exchanging adenosine triphosphatase.catalyzes the active uptake of K+ and efflux of Na+ ions, thus controlling ionic gradients through the enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP. It is a heterodimer of two different kinds of subunit, a large α subunit with multiple membrane spans and a smaller glycoprotein subunit, β, with just one span and the bulk of its mass in the extracellular space. Both subunits of Na,K-ATPase are encoded by multigene families. In the rat, three isoforms of α subunit and two isoforms of β subunit have been identified and substantially characterized (1Levenson R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 123: 1-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chow D.C. Forte J.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the major ATPase characteristics are assigned to the α subunit, the β subunit is required for folding and transport of α,β-heterodimers to the plasma membrane (2Chow D.C. Forte J.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there have been a number of reports in which little or no β1 or β2 subunit or mRNA was detected despite significant levels of α or its mRNA (3Brown T.A. Horowitz B. Miller R.P.

The full-length human clone revealed 59% sequence identity with the β3 subunit of Xenopus laevis and 38 and 48% identity with human β1 and β2 subunits, respectively, and was named β3 (10Malik N. Canfield V.A. Beckers M.C. Gros P. Levenson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22754-22758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Full-length clones were independently isolated from cDNA libraries from C6 rat glioma cells (GenBank™ D84450) and mouse retina (11Besirli C.G. Gong T.L. Lomax M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis and representation in the expressed sequence tag data bank has revealed β3 message in a wide variety of tissues. Expression of the β3 subunit at the protein level and its association with the Na,K-ATPase has not been demonstrated yet however. Here we accomplish these aims with an antibody, specific for the rat β3 subunit, that will be a useful addition to an existing panel of isoform-specific antibodies to the Na,K-ATPase. Antipeptide-directed antiserum RNTβ3 (rat N terminus of β3) was raised at Quality Control Biochemicals, Inc. (Hopkinton, MA), against the 13-mer peptide TKTEKKSFHQSLAC-(NH2), corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of the rat β3 isoform (GenBank™ D84450) plus a terminal cysteine residue. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a carrier, and two rabbits were immunized. The immune response was tested with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with bovine serum albumin-coupled peptide on solid phase. The titer of crude sera against the peptide was >200,000 for the better rabbit. Other antibodies were generous gifts of other investigators: antiserum against the KETYY peptide representing the C terminus of all α subunits of Na,K-ATPase from R. Bayer and J. Kyte (University of California, San Diego); antipeptide antiserum 757 against sheep β1 from W. J. Ball, Jr. (University of Cincinnati); anti-fusion protein antiserum FPβ1 against rat β1 from A. McDonough (University of Southern California); antiserum SpETβ2 against human β2 from P. Martin-Vasallo (University de la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain); and monoclonal antibody SM-GP50 for β2 from J. Gurd (University of Toronto) and P. Beesley (Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, Egham, United Kingdom). The C6 glioma cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Membrane preparations from rat tissues were made as follows. Brain, lung, liver, kidney, and testis were minced and homogenized with a motor-driven Teflon homogenizer in 10 volumes of buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 30 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Unhomogenized material and nuclei were removed by low-speed centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 15 min, and membranes were sedimented at 33,000 rpm for 30 min. For cardiac and skeletal muscle preparations, the tissues were minced and homogenized in 40 volumes of buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by further disruption with an Omni homogenizer for 30 s at the maximal setting. The homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Sarcolemma-enriched fractions were obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant at 33,000 rpm for 30 min. Protein concentration was determined according to Lowry. Partial purification of the Na,K-ATPase from rat brain microsomes and C6 crude membranes by extraction with SDS was performed as described elsewhere (12Sweadner K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis and Western blots were performed as described earlier (13Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10932-10942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that detection was by chemiluminescence using luminol-based reagents (Pierce). Blots were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer. Deglycosylation was performed as follows. Membranes were resuspended at 1–2 mg/ml in 0.25 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, denatured with 0.1% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of 1–2 units of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) and up to 0.5% Triton X-100. The reaction was performed overnight at room temperature or at 37 °C. To detect β3 protein, we generated an antiserum based on the N-terminal sequence deduced from the rat cDNA sequence. To test its reactivity with β3, rat C6 glioma cells were used, since the clone had been isolated from a C6 cDNA library. The antiserum stained C6 cell plasma membranes by immunofluorescence (data not shown). To determine whether β3 was associated with the Na,K-ATPase, the enzyme was partially purified from C6 crude membranes using SDS treatment followed by equilibrium centrifugation on a sucrose density gradient. During such treatment most other membrane proteins are solubilized, while Na,K-ATPase remains associated with plasma membrane. As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, the RNTβ3 antibody stained a fuzzy band with a molecular mass of about 42–45 kDa in preparations that had a Na,K-ATPase specific activity of 100–150 μmol of Pi/mg/h (equivalent to 30–50-fold purification). Since both β1 and β2 subunits have been shown to be glycoproteins containing several N-linked oligosaccharide chains (14Treuheit M.J. Costello C.E. Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13914-13919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fahrig T. Schmitz B. Weber D. Kucherer-Ehret A. Faissner A. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar),N-glycosidase F treatment was performed to determine whether β3 was also glycosylated. As seen in Fig. 1 A, this resulted in a decrease in apparent molecular mass to 35 kDa. Fig.1 B demonstrates that β3 is the only known β isoform of the Na,K-ATPase purified from C6 glioma cells, contrasting with the β1 and β2 isoforms found in Na,K-ATPase purified from rat brain. Different dilutions of sample were added to facilitate comparisons. The content of α (α1 only for C6; all three α subunits for rat brain) was determined by staining the blots with the KETYY antibody against the C-terminal peptide of all α subunits. Equal amounts of the sodium pump α subunits were loaded for rat brain and C6 samples, but the C6 membranes had no β1 or β2 and were more than four times more enriched in β3 than rat brain enzyme. Removal of oligosaccharide chains often facilitates glycoprotein detection on blots. As seen in Fig. 2, fully glycosylated β3 could be detected in rat brain microsomes only when 25–50 μg of protein were loaded. In deglycosylated samples, the binding was almost linear within a 5–50 μg range, however. Consequently, in further experiments we routinely used glycosidase treatment. Molecular masses of the mature and core β3 protein calculated from their mobilities on SDS gels were different from those of β1 and β2 subunits. As seen in Fig. 3 A, the mature β3 protein migrated faster than the mature β2 subunit. This was not surprising since rat β3 has only two potentialN-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain, whereas rat β2 has seven. As shown in Fig. 3 B (in an experiment where no compensation was made for the smaller amount of β3 than β1 or β2), the core β3 protein migrated significantly slower than the core β2 protein and slightly slower than the core β1 subunit. Average values for glycosylated proteins were 46–50 kDa for β1 and β2 and 42–45 kDa for β3. Average values for core proteins were 34–37 kDa for β1, 32–34 kDa for β2, and 35–38 kDa for β3. The apparent size of core β3 is larger than predicted from the cDNA clone (30 kDa); the biochemical basis for the discrepancy remains to be determined. Fig. 3 B also illustrates an incidental peculiarity of glycoprotein staining. β1 and β2 were each stained with two different antibodies, and certain antibodies were substantially less sensitive to the glycosylated protein than to the core. This is likely to reflect differences in the proximity of their epitopes to glycosylation sites. The species specificity of the RNTβ3 antibody was examined with blots of 50 μg of deglycosylated brain microsomes from several species. β3 protein was detected readily in rat and mouse brain samples and more weakly in guinea pig samples (data not shown). All other samples, including human, chicken, rabbit, dog, cat, sheep, calf, monkey (Macaca), frog (Rana), and goldfish brain membranes, were negative. There is only 69% identity within the first 13 amino acids among mammalian β3 subunits, and even less for other vertebrates. 2Although named β2, this isoform of β from the chicken is grouped with β3 sequences by dendrogram analysis of evolutionary relationships (2Chow D.C. Forte J.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Rat:Mouse:Guinea pig:Human:Chicken2:Xenopus:*TKTEKKSFHQSLA*(GenBank™D84450)*TKTEKKSFHQSLA*(11)*TKSEKKSLNESLA*(GenBank™D84448)*TKNEKKSLNQSLA*(10)*SKETKKPFRQSVA*(16)*AKEENKGSEQSGS*(17)We propose that the dominant epitope includes the amino acids TKTE and that substitution of serine for threonine in guinea pig β3 is weakly permissive, but substitution of asparagine in human β3 prevents RNTβ3 binding. RNTβ3 has also been observed to be negative on human β3 expressed in insect cells. 3N. N. Modyanov, personal communication. A panel of adult rat tissues was examined for the presence of the Na,K-ATPase β3 subunit on blots. In Fig. 4 A, concentrations of samples were adjusted to ensure reasonable levels of the α subunit, as detected with anti-KETYY. β3 staining was strong in testis, lung, and liver when as much as 150 μg of microsomes were analyzed. A strong signal was also obtained with kidney outer medulla microsomes, whereas much less was detected in rat brain microsomes. Only a little β3 was seen in heart and skeletal muscle samples. Blots were scanned, and Fig. 4 B shows the relative abundance of the β3 protein within the Na,K-ATPase complex estimated by taking the ratios between β3 and α subunit staining. We found lung and testis to have the highest proportion of β3 isoform expression per Na,K-ATPase unit among the adult rat tissues tested. β3 content was lower in skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney outer medulla, and in heart and brain Na,K-ATPase it comprised only a minor fraction. It should be stressed that the data are expressed relative to the β3/α ratio in lung. It is known that lung also expresses β1 protein (18Sun Y. Ball Jr., W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1491-C1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the proportion of the two isoforms has not yet been determined. The same tissues (except testis) were analyzed at day 7 after birth. Fig. 4 C illustrates that as in the adult, the expression of β3 protein in lung was high, but it was almost undetectable in the liver. Surprisingly, the strongest signal for β3 was in sarcolemma-enriched membranes from hind limb skeletal muscle. Since there was almost no difference in the amount of α subunit between lung and skeletal muscle samples as judged by anti-KETYY staining, this indicates that skeletal muscle has the highest proportion of β3 in the P7 rat of the tissues studied (Fig. 4 D). Comparison of Fig. 4, B and D, illustrates that brain and heart from newborn rat, like skeletal muscle, were more enriched in the β3 protein per Na,K-ATPase unit than those tissues from adult rat. Thus expression of the β3 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase is subject to developmental regulation in several tissues. In several experimental systems it has been possible to form active combinations of Na,K-ATPase or H,K-ATPase α subunits with different β subunits, even ostensibly mismatched pairs (i.e. NaK α/HK β). The outcome is that exchange of β subunits has effects on the enzymatic properties of the complex, most notably on the affinities for K+ or Na+(19Schmalzing G. Kroner S. Schachner M. Gloor S. J.

This implies that tissue- or developmentally controlled differences in α-β combination may have direct physiological consequences mediated by alteration of substrate affinity. β2 has also been implicated in intercellular adhesion in the developing nervous system (26Gloor S.

The observation that β3 is expressed at the highest level (relative to total α subunit) in liver and lung may resolve some long-standing controversies. In the liver, β1 subunit has been detected only after density gradient purification (18Sun Y. Ball Jr., W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1491-C1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in prior studies it was not seen (6Hubert J.J. Schenk D.B. Skelly H. Leffert H.L.

Even mRNA for β1 has been frequently undetectable or low (3Brown T.A. Horowitz B. Miller R.P. McDonough A.A. Farley R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Emanuel J.R. Garetz S. Stone L. Levenson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1993; 131: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although it was high in liver from young animals and was specifically increased by thyroid hormone and by resection-induced proliferation (4Emanuel J.R. Garetz S. Stone L. Levenson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9030-9034Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Desai-Yajnik V. Zeng J. Omori K. Sherman J. Morimoto T.

Most of the negative results could in principle be attributed to insufficient sensitivity, but an analysis of the distribution of Na,K-ATPase in liver suggests a more important problem. In early work there were discrepancies between the subcellular distribution of histochemical reaction for Na,K-ATPase activity and immunoreactivity (reviewed in Ref. 32Leffert H.L. Schenk D.B. Hubert J.L. Skelly H. Schumacher M. Ariyasu R. Ellisman M. Koch K.S. Keller G.A. Hepatology. 1985; 5: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The controversy centered on whether the pump was located on sinusoidal or canalicular subcellular membranes, which is relevant to understanding the mechanism of salt and water transport during the secretion of bile. Histochemistry indicated a sinusoidal (basolateral) distribution, while initial antibody staining suggested a canalicular (apical) distribution. The interpretation was complicated by evidence that membrane lipid fluidity affected Na,K-ATPase activity and that fluidization uncovered cryptic activity in the canalicular domain (33Sutherland E. Dixon B.S. Leffert H.L. Skally H. Zaccaro L. Simon F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8673-8677Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Later immunocytochemistry by the same investigators documented that Na,K-ATPase α1 subunits were found in both domains, but the β1 subunit was found predominantly in the sinusoidal domain (7Simon F.R. Leffert H.L. Ellisman M. Iwahashi M. Deerinck T. Fortune J. Morales D. Dahl R. Sutherland E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C69-C84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oddly, a less well characterized anti-Na,K-ATPase antibody selectively stained the canalicular domain. The polarized distribution of reactivity for β1 correlated with the prior histochemistry, suggesting that the presence of β1 makes the enzyme active. Most recently, this group reported that the increased β1 seen during hepatic regeneration was specifically localized to the canalicular domain and lateral surfaces of the hepatocyte (8Simon F.R. Fortune J. Alexander A. Iwahashi M. Dahl R. Sutherland E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24967-24975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fluidization of the membrane increased Na,K-ATPase activity in the canalicular fraction in control rats (where β1 was absent), but not in that from rats undergoing regeneration (where β1 was present). Thus there appear to be functional differences in canalicular Na,K-ATPase depending on whether or not β1 is expressed there (8Simon F.R. Fortune J. Alexander A. Iwahashi M. Dahl R. Sutherland E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24967-24975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We can now speculate that the missing β subunit in normal adult rats is β3 and that it is responsible for the difference. Little or no mRNA for β3 has been detected on Northern blots of adult mouse or rat liver RNA (10Malik N. Canfield V.A. Beckers M.C. Gros P. Levenson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22754-22758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Besirli C.G. Gong T.L. Lomax M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but this is likely to be due to the low level of expression of any Na,K-ATPase subunit, requiring greater sensitivity. Another puzzle that may be explained by the presence of β3 in rat liver is a report of tissue-specific kinetic differences in Na,K-ATPases from lamb kidney and liver (18Sun Y. Ball Jr., W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1491-C1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although both of these enzyme preparations contained α1 and β1, the liver preparation had significantly higher affinities for ATP, Na+, and K+. The presence of β3, as well as β1, in the liver enzyme may account for the difference, although β3 conferred lower affinity for K+ than β1 with Bufo orXenopus subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes (20Jaisser F. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16895-16903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The literature on Na,K-ATPase expression in lung also has some relevant peculiarities. Na,K-ATPase activity increases sharply during the perinatal period because of its role in fluid reabsorption immediately after birth. In whole lung, α1 and β1 mRNA levels peaked at birth and then fell to a lower level maintained in the adult (9Crump R.G. Askew G.R. Wert S.E. Lingrel J.B. Joiner C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L299-L308PubMed Google Scholar, 34Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10436-10442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35O'Brodovich H. Staub O. Rossier B.C. Geering K. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1137-C1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both type II pneumocytes in alveoli and bronchiolar epithelial cells have high levels of Na,K-ATPase (36Schneeberger E.E. McCarthy K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1986; 60: 1584-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 37Pinter E. Peyman J.A. Snow K. Jamieson J.D. Warshaw J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The most intriguing results were obtained by examining mRNA levels with in situ hybridization (9Crump R.G. Askew G.R. Wert S.E. Lingrel J.B. Joiner C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L299-L308PubMed Google Scholar, 37Pinter E. Peyman J.A. Snow K. Jamieson J.D. Warshaw J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). During the perinatal period, α1 mRNA increased dramatically in bronchiolar epithelium, but not so much in alveoli, while β1 mRNA increased dramatically in both loci. Beginning at day 8 postnatally, β1 signal developed a punctate pattern in alveoli, while α1 signal remained broadly distributed. We can speculate that the some of the α1 may be associated with β3, since β1 appeared to be distributed in specific cells of the adult alveolar epithelium. mRNA for β3 has been detected in adult rat and mouse lung (10Malik N. Canfield V.A. Beckers M.C. Gros P. Levenson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22754-22758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Besirli C.G. Gong T.L. Lomax M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the presence of β3 associated with Na,K-ATPase in various tissues presents a more complete picture of this enzyme's isoform composition and points to possible functional differences important for the physiology of several tissues. It has not been ruled out that β3 may also associate with H,K-ATPases, a possibility supported by the interchangeability of β subunits in expression systems. The effect of β subunits on α substrate affinities, and now potentially on the presence or absence of measurable activity, supports the idea that β has a regulatory role."

This article reports for the first time the effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and structurally related analogs on whole cell chloride currents in osteoblastic cells. 1α,25(OH)2D3 promoted the rapid enhancement of outwardly rectifying Cl− currents in 93% of the osteoblasts in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal increase of about 4-fold between 0.5 and 5 nm. This effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 was blocked by 1 nm stereoisomer 1β,25(OH)2D3when added to the bath before 1α,25(OH)2D3. On the other hand, 1 nm of the 6-s-cis locked analog 1α,25(OH)2-lumisterol3 significantly increased by about 2.2-fold outward Cl− currents in the ROS 17/2.8 cells, whereas the increase promoted by same concentration of the 6-s-trans locked analog 1α,25(OH)2-tachysterol (0.8-fold) was significantly lower, suggesting that the 6-s-cis locked or steroid-like form was preferred over the extended 6-s-trans conformer to promote these rapid effects of the hormone. We conclude that the agonist effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 in osteoblasts at the cellular membrane level seem to be determined by some structural features of the molecule which may be crucial for its interaction with a putative membrane receptor in the cell surface. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3(1α,25(OH)2D3) can generate biological responses via genomic and nongenomic mechanisms.

In particular, chloride channel activity in osteoblasts has been postulated to be related to rapid changes in the electrical state of the cell and a regulatory cellular volume response observed under the influence of different hormones acting on the bone (22Chesnoy-Marchais D. Fritsch J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 415: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Gosling M. Smith J.W. Poyner D.R. J. Physiol.

To date, only a few published papers have shown the modulatory effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on ion channel activity in target cells, which are believed to represent one of the first examples of a nongenomic response. It has been demonstrated in osteoblasts that the hormone facilitates the opening of L-type Ca2+ channels (9Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yukihiro S. Posner G.H. Guggino S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23889-23893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); these responses occurred within seconds after the addition of 1α,25(OH)2D3. Recently, we reported in a preliminary communication that 1α,25(OH)2D3also increases an outwardly rectifying anion conductance in ROS 17/2.8 cells (11Zanello L.P. Norman A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this report we study via whole cell patch-clamp techniques the relative ability of the conformationally flexible 1α,25(OH)2D3 and related analogs to modulate chloride channels in ROS 17/2.8 cells. Our results demonstrate that the rapid effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on chloride channels are determined by specific structural components of the agonist ligand. Thus the 1-hydroxy epimer 1β,25(OH)2D3 was found to be an antagonist of 1α,25(OH)2D3, and the 6-s-cislocked 1α,25(OH)2-lumisterol was significantly more potent than the 6-s-trans locked 1α,25(OH)2-tachysterol in stimulating Cl−currents in these bone cells. This is also the first extended report on the participation of Cl− channels in nongenomic effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3. ROS 17/2.8 cells (obtained from M. C. Farach-Carson) were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 5% Serum Plus (JRH Biosciences, Woodland, CA), as described previously (11Zanello L.P. Norman A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For patch-clamp experiments, cells were plated at very low density in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. Prior to recordings, the cells were washed at least three times with the electrophysiological external solution to remove the medium completely. Initially we used recording solutions designed by others (9Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The composition of the external (extracellular) solution was: 110 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 20 mmBa2+, 130 mm glutamate, 10 mmHepes, and 20 mm glucose (pH 7.4, adjusted withN-methyl-d-glucamine). The pipette (intracellular) solution contained: 100 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 150 mm Hepes, 2 mm Mg2+, 2 mm Ca2+, and 20 mm EGTA. For the recording of Cl−currents, we used an external solution (modified from Ref. 23Gosling M. Smith J.W. Poyner D.R. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 485: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) consisting of 140 mm tetraethylammonium-Cl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 20 mm BaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4, adjusted with tetraethylammonium-OH). The corresponding pipette solution contained 140 mm CsCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH). The osmolarity of the solutions was 290 mosmol/kg (adjusted with glucose). The presence of 20 mmexternal Ba2+ allowed the simultaneous recording of inward currents through Ca2+ channels. A high concentration of tetraethylammonium+ outside and Cs+ inside the cell prevented the recording of K+ channel activity. Patch-clamp recordings (26Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 381: 85-100Crossref Scopus (15174) Google Scholar) were performed with an Axopatch 1C patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Patch pipettes were fabricated from Drummond capillaries (Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA), coated with Sylgard elastomer (Dow Corning Corp., Midland, MI) to reduce capacitative transients, and fire-polished. Experiments were carried out at room temperature. Currents were low-pass-filtered at 1 kHz and digitized every 100 μs. Cell membrane capacitance and series resistance were electronically compensated prior to the recording of currents. Leak current compensation was done by subtracting the leak current elicited by an hyperpolarizing pulse from −70 mV to −80 mV. In all experiments, depolarizing pulses were applied at intervals of 2–4 s. 1α,25(OH)2D3, 25-OH-D3, and 1β,25(OH)2D3(analog HL) were obtained from M. Uskokovic (Hoffmann-La Roche); 1α,25(OH)2-lumisterol3 (analog JN) and 1α,25(OH)2-tachysterol (analog JB) from W. H. Okamura (University of California, Riverside, CA) (27Norman, A. W., Okamura, W. H., Hammond, M. W., Bishop, J. E., Dormanen, M. C., Bouillon, R., Van Baelen, H., Ridal, A. L., Daane, E., Khoury, R., and Farach-Carson, M. C. (1997)Mol. Endocrinol., in press.Google Scholar). Vitamin D analogs were stored in the dark as stock solutions in absolute ethanol at −20 °C and added to the bath solution containing 1 mg/ml cytochrome c, which was used as a nonspecific protein carrier. Appropriate controls for cytochrome c and a final ethanol concentration of 0.01% or less were carried out before the addition of the analogs to the bath. CdCl2 (Sigma) and nifedipine (Sigma) were used as specific Ca2+ channel blockers and were added to the bath from aqueous and ethanolic stock solutions, respectively. 4,4′-Diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS, Sigma) was used as a specific Cl− channel blocker and was added to the bath from a stock solution made in the recording medium. Cholesterol (Calbiochem) and β-estradiol (Sigma) were added to the bath from a stock solution in ethanol. The structures of the conformationally flexible 1α,25(OH)2D3 and other analogs employed in this study are shown in Fig.1. We first recorded the activity of previously described voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels in the ROS 17/2.8 cells (9Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol.

In this experiment, an increase in the concentration of 1α,25(OH)2D3to 5 nm did not cause any additional effect, although this result varied among different cells. We recorded a mean shift of −10.4 ± 2.6 mV in 8 out of 22 cells (36%) studied under the same conditions. These 1α,25(OH)2D3-sensitive inward Ba2+ currents were almost completely blocked by 100 μm Cd2+, a Ca2+ channel blocker, subsequently added to the bath. As postulated previously (9Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this modification of the voltage sensitivity of Ca2+ channels in osteoblasts by 1α,25(OH)2D3 may result in the facilitation of Ca2+ channel opening by the hormone for Ca2+ uptake at membrane potentials close to the resting value, which has been reported to be in the range of −10 to −40 mV in osteoblasts (25Ferrier J.

In a preliminary communication we reported that 1α,25(OH)2D3 also affects Cl−channel activity in the ROS 17/2.8 cells (11Zanello L.P. Norman A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the presence of 100 μm Cd2+ in the bath which effectively blocks Ca2+ channel activity, an outward current was recorded in the range of −30 to 80 mV in the glutamate-containing external solution (see “Experimental Procedures”) in approximately 80% of the cells, as shown in Fig. 3. The addition of a final concentration of 0.05 nm1α,25(OH)2D3 to the bath caused, in the case of this particular cell, a 1.2-fold increase of the outward current measured at 80 mV over the course of 2.5 min. The time course of this effect is shown in Fig. 3 B. After a lag period of about 45 s, which could be attributed to the time required for diffusion of the steroid to the cell and/or the stimulation of cellular signal transduction pathways, the rapid increase of the current took place over the course of the next 30 s. 1α,25(OH)2D3 promoted the increase of outward currents in 14 out of 15 cells (93%) studied under the same recording conditions. This enhancing effect was dependent on the concentration of the hormone in the range of 0.05–50 nm (see also Fig.5).Figure 5Fold increase of outward currents in ROS 17/2.8 cells mediated by 1α,25(OH)2D3 in the absence and presence of 1 nm1β,25(OH)2D3. Fold increase of current amplitudes promoted by different concentrations of 1α,25(OH)2D3 were measured for currents elicited by a depolarizing step to 80 mV, in the absence and presence of 1 nm HL in the bath. In each case, at least a 3-min period was allowed after the addition of the analog to the bath for currents to reach a stable amplitude value. Currents were obtained in the presence of glutamate as the permeant anion since seals were more stable and long lasting than in the presence of Cl−. Anion currents were isolated from inward Ba2+ currents after blockade of Ca2+ channels with 100 μmCd2+. 1α,25(OH)2D3 alone showed a concentration-dependent effect on the promotion of anion currents (14 out of 15 cells, 93%), with a maximal value obtained for 0.5–5 nm hormone (black bars). In the presence of 1 nm 1β,25(OH)2D3 (white bars), the potentiation effect by 1α,25(OH)2D3 was significantly reduced (*,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01,n = 3–8) for a concentration of the hormone of 5 nm or less.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Permeability studies carried out by replacing the main anion in the recording solution are summarized in TableI. We found that the 1α,25(OH)2D3-sensitive outward current was permeable to glutamate and Cl−, suggesting a poor anion discrimination of this channel. On the other hand, gluconate in the external solution significantly decreased outward currents, as expected for a less permeable anion. The addition of 200 μm DIDS, a specific Cl− channel blocker, to the bath blocked the 1α,25(OH)2D3-enhanced outward currents, as shown in Fig. 4. This blockade by DIDS was time- and voltage-dependent. It developed over the course of 1–2 min after the addition of the agent to the bath. As described before for the blockade by DIDS of the cAMP-activated Cl− currents in primary cultured rat osteoblasts (22Chesnoy-Marchais D. Fritsch J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 415: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and of the mechanosensitive Cl− channels in ROS 17/2.8 cells (23Gosling M. Smith J.W. Poyner D.R. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 485: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), these 1α,25(OH)2D3-sensitive Cl− currents were strongly reduced by the agent but were not completely blocked. DIDS was shown to be effective at a concentration of 200 μm when any of the anions shown in Table I were used.Table IPermeability of the 1α,25(OH)2D3-sensitive outward conductance in ROS 17/2.8 cells to different anionsExternal solutionInternal solutionCurrent amplitudeMain anionMain cationMain anionMain cationpA130 glutamate110 NMDG+150 Hepes100 NMDG+178 ± 19 (n = 9)140 Cl−140 TEA+140 Cl−140 Cs+486 ± 106 (n = 14)140 gluconate140 Na+140 Cl−140 Cs+5 ± 3 (n = 5)The outward current amplitude was measured at 80 mV.

No inward currents were recorded at membrane potentials below the reversal potential (E rev) for Cl− in the Cl−-containing solutions (see “Experimental Procedures”). The E revfor Cl− calculated from the Nernst equation gave a value of ≈−6 mV, which is very close to the value found from the recordings. The synthetic analog 1β,25(OH)2D3 (analog HL), which only differs from the natural metabolite in the orientation of the hydroxy group on carbon 1 (see Fig. 1), has been shown by this laboratory to inhibit the rapid activation of transepithelial calcium transport by 1α,25(OH)2D3 in chick intestine (30Norman A.W. Bouillon R. Farach-Carson M.C. Bishop J.E. Zhou L.-X. Nemere I. Zhao J. Muralidharan K.R. Okamura W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20022-20030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and45Ca2+ uptake in ROS 17/2.8 cells (31Norman A.W. Nemere I. Raman Muralidharan K. Okamura W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1450-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Analog HL has also been shown to reduce the agonist potentiation by 1α,25(OH)2D3 of Ca2+ channels in ROS 17/2.8 cells (32Takeuchi K. Guggino S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33335-33343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated the effects of 1β,25(OH)2D3 on outward Cl−currents in the osteoblastic cells. No enhancement of the Cl− currents by 1 nm1β,25(OH)2D3 was found in 44% of the studied cells, while we recorded a modest 1.1 ± 0.3-fold increase of the outward currents at 80 mV in the remaining 56% of the cases (9 out of 16 cells) (data not shown). The addition of 0.05–5 nm1α,25(OH)2D3 to the bath in the presence of 1 nm HL promoted a significantly lower increase of the outward anion current if compared with the increments recorded for the hormone alone (see Fig. 5). On the contrary, when the concentration of 1α,25(OH)2D3 was raised to 50 nm, the increase of the outward currents in the presence of the β-stereoisomer was similar to that measured for the hormone alone, suggesting that both ligands may be competing for the same receptor. These results with HL suggest that the 1-hydroxy epimer 1β,25(OH)2D3 may act as an antagonist of the 1α,25(OH)2D3 effects on Cl−channels in osteoblasts as it blocked the effects of the hormone on these cells. The natural metabolite 25-OH-D3 promoted an increase in Cl− outward currents in 12 out of 14 (86%) ROS 17/2.8 cells within the first 5 min when added to the external solution at a concentration of 0.05–5 nm. In the case of the cell shown in Fig. 6 A, 5 nm25-OH-D3 caused a 2.7-fold increase of the current at 80 mV. On the other hand, 25-OH-D3 did not cause any significant modification of I/V relations for inward Ba2+currents in the range of 0.05–50 nm (see Fig.6 B), which agrees with previously published results (9Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yukihiro S. Posner G.H. Guggino S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23889-23893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of this effect of 25-OH-D3 on Cl− currents, which was not found on Ba2+currents in the same cellular system, may be indicative of different modulatory mechanisms underlying the mode of action of the vitamin D metabolites. It has been recently shown that synthetic vitamin D analogs locked in the 6-s-cis position (steroid-like molecules, see Fig. 1) are potent agonists for the rapid effects of the hormone, while 6-s-trans locked conformers (extended forms) are inactive for the same responses in target cells (27Norman, A. W., Okamura, W. H., Hammond, M. W., Bishop, J. E., Dormanen, M. C., Bouillon, R., Van Baelen, H., Ridal, A. L., Daane, E., Khoury, R., and Farach-Carson, M. C. (1997)Mol.

Noticeable transcaltachia-promoting effects in chick intestinal epithelium and 45Ca2+ uptake by ROS 17/2.8 cells have been described specifically for the synthetic conformer 1α,25(OH)2-lumisterol3 (analog JN), which is locked in the 6-s-cis position (27Norman, A. W., Okamura, W. H., Hammond, M. W., Bishop, J. E., Dormanen, M. C., Bouillon, R., Van Baelen, H., Ridal, A. L., Daane, E., Khoury, R., and Farach-Carson, M. C. (1997)Mol. Endocrinol., in press.Google Scholar). We found that 1–10 nm analog JN caused a 2.2 ± 0.7-fold increase of the outward anion conductance in 7 out of 10 ROS 17/2.8 cells (70%). This response did not differ significantly from the effects promoted by 0.5 nm 1α,25(OH)2D3(p < 0.05, see Fig. 7). On the other hand, 1α,25(OH)2-tachysterol (analog JB), a synthetic 6-s-trans conformer which has been shown to be inactive in both transchaltachia and 45Ca2+influx in osteoblasts (27Norman, A. W., Okamura, W. H., Hammond, M. W., Bishop, J. E., Dormanen, M. C., Bouillon, R., Van Baelen, H., Ridal, A. L., Daane, E., Khoury, R., and Farach-Carson, M. C. (1997)Mol. Endocrinol., in press.Google Scholar) promoted only a modest 0.8 ± 0.3-fold increase of Cl− currents at 80 mV when applied at 1–10 nm in 80% of the cells. In this case, the response differed significantly from the enhancing effect exerted by 0.5 nm 1α,25(OH)2D3(p < 0.05, Fig. 7). The magnitude of the effects on Cl− currents promoted by the different analogs of 1α,25(OH)2D3 used in this work is shown comparatively in Fig. 7. Note that the effects promoted by 1–10 nm JN and 1–10 nm JB on these Cl− currents differed significantly from each other (p < 0.01). The specificity of ion channel responses to 1α,25(OH)2D3 analogs was investigated by means of the evaluation of possible effects exerted by other steroids on the Cl− outward currents in ROS 17/2.8 cells. Steroid hormones have been demonstrated to modify ion channel activity in different cells (34Twyman R.E. Macdonald R.L. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1992; 456: 215-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 35Zhang S.J. Jackson M.B. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 6: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Joels M. Karst H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4289-4297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As also shown in Fig. 7, 50 nm cholesterol and 0.01–10 nm β-estradiol did not have any significant effect on the Cl− currents studied in this work. It has been demonstrated in osteoblasts that different hormones taking part in the process of bone remodeling affect ion channel activity in the plasma membrane. More specifically, electrophysiological measurements carried out on the bone-forming cells have shown that the secosteroid 1α,25(OH)2D3increases Ca2+ influx through voltage-activated Ca2+ channels by facilitating the opening of the channels at membrane potentials close to the resting value (9Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yukihiro S. Posner G.H. Guggino S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23889-23893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also enhances an outward K+ current activated by depolarization (37Chesnoy-Marchais D. Fritsch J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1148: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms for ion channel modulation by the hormone and their physiological role remain unknown. We recently described in a preliminary report the enhancing effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on Cl− currents in the osteoblastic cell line ROS 17/2.8 cells (11Zanello L.P. Norman A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present work, we describe in more detail the effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and related structural analogs on these currents, this being the first extended report on a Cl− conductive membrane pathway involved in the rapid responses of this secosteroid. We found an outwardly rectifying voltage-dependent Cl− current activated upon depolarization in ROS 17/2.8 cells that can be increased by external application of physiological concentrations of the hormonally active 1α,25(OH)2D3. This effect was found in 93% of the studied cells. Since patch-clamp currents are defined on the basis of the direction of the movement of positive charges, an outward current in the case of anions represents an influx of the negative charges into the cell. Therefore, according to our results, the depolarization of the osteoblast membrane from the resting value (−40 to −10 mV, according to Refs. 28Ferrier J. Ward A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 126: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 29Fritsch J. Edelman A. Balsan S. Bone Miner. 1987; 2: 463-478PubMed Google Scholar) activates an influx of anions, Cl− being the most abundant one under physiological conditions. The potentiation of the anion currents by 1α,25(OH)2D3 was dependent upon the concentration of the hormone and had a maximal increase at 0.5–5 nm followed by an attenuation at 50 nm. A biphasic effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 was also previously described for other nongenomic effects of the hormone including the promotion of Ca2+ uptake in ROS 17/2.8 cells and the rapid Ca2+ transport process in the chick intestinal epithelium (transcaltachia) (9Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Norman A.W. Okamura W.H. Farach-Carson M.C. Allewaert K. Branisteanu D. Nemere I. Muralidharan K.R. Bouillon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13811-13819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enhancing effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on the anion currents in the osteoblastic cell line developed rapidly, in the course of only a few seconds to minutes. The rapidity of these effects suggests that they are different from the classical steroid receptor-mediated nuclear effects and are part of an increasing list of 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated nongenomic effects described in different target cells (2Norman A.W.

Structure-function studies carried out with different structurally related 1α,25(OH)2D3 analogs on different target cellular systems have proved to be very useful in defining the molecular steps involved in the mechanisms of action of the hormone (reviewed in Ref. 1Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of rapid nongenomic effects postulated to be initiated at the plasma membrane level, the use of synthetic analogs has led to the discovery that some structural forms are “preferred” over others which have been shown to be more effective in genomic processes. The natural secosteroid 1α,25(OH)2D3 exists as a continuum of potential shapes extended from the 6-s-cis (steroid-like) to the 6-s-trans (extended, see Fig. 1) which may interact with the receptors. It has been shown recently that synthetic 6-s-trans locked analogs are inactive in both rapid and some genomic responses, while 6-s-cis locked analogs are potent agonists of membrane-initiated nongenomic effects (27Norman, A. W., Okamura, W. H., Hammond, M. W., Bishop, J. E., Dormanen, M. C., Bouillon, R., Van Baelen, H., Ridal, A. L., Daane, E., Khoury, R., and Farach-Carson, M. C. (1997)Mol. Endocrinol., in press.Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrate for the first time that the 6-s-cislocked analog 1α,25(OH)2-lumisterol3significantly increased outwardly rectifying voltage-activated Cl− currents in ROS 17/2.8 cells, whereas the enhancing effects by 1α,25(OH)2-tachysterol, the corresponding 6-s-trans conformer, were significantly lower (see Fig.7). In a related study the 1β epimer of 1α,25(OH)2D3, 1β,25(OH)2D3, which has been shown to block the rapid effects of the hormone (30Norman A.W. Bouillon R. Farach-Carson M.C. Bishop J.E. Zhou L.-X.

Holick M.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), remarkably decreased the potentiation of Cl− currents by 1α,25(OH)2D3 in ROS 17/2.8 cells (see Fig.5), suggesting that it may also act as an antagonist of ion channel responses by the hormone. We conclude that inversion of the orientation of the hydroxyl on carbon 1 of the hormone (1β for 1α) may be enough to block the response of cell ion channels by competitively binding to the same surface receptor as a first step in the process. Finally, the specific effects found for the natural metabolite 25-OH-D3 on Cl− currents but not on Ba2+ currents in ROS 17/2.8 cells (see Fig. 6) open the possibility to the existence of different cellular modulatory mechanisms underlying the control of membrane ionic pathways and the electrical state of the cell by active 1α,25(OH)2D3. Although there is growing evidence that 1α,25(OH)2D3 may exert its rapid, nongenomic effects by interacting with a putative mVDR and by initiating a series of molecular pathways involving second messengers, future experiments need to be carried out to elucidate the molecular steps linking the hormonal signal and the specific enhancement of voltage-dependent outward Cl− currents in osteoblasts. We wish to thank Prof. M. E. Adams and Dr. T. Norris for their helpful comments, Prof. W. H. Okamura for providing the analogs of 1α,25(OH)2D3, and June Bishop for her contributions to the project."

The peptide structures have been confirmed by mass spectrometry and chemical synthesis. In contrast to the 12–18 residue, 4 Cys-containing α-conotoxins, the new toxins have 30 residues and 6 Cys residues. The toxins, named αA-conotoxins EIVA and EIVB, block both Torpedo and mouse α1-containing muscle subtype nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes at low nanomolar concentrations. In contrast to α-bungarotoxin, αA-EIVA is inactive at α7-containing nAChRs even at micromolar concentrations. In this regard, αA-EIVA is similar to the previously described α-conotoxins (e.g. α-MI and α-GI) which also selectively target α1- versus α7-containing nAChRs. However, α-MI and α-GI discriminate between the α/δversus α/γ subunit interfaces of the mouse muscle nAChR with 10,000-fold selectivity. In contrast, αA-conotoxin EIVA blocks both the α/γ site and α/δ site with equally high affinity but with distinct kinetics. The αA-conotoxins thus represent novel probes for the α/γ as well as the α/δ binding sites of the nAChR.

The carnivorous cone snails (genus Conus) comprise 500 species that specialize on a variety of prey, including fish. There are ∼50–70 different fish-hunting Conus species which use venom as the primary weapon for immobilizing prey. Their venoms are extremely complex, and each Conus species has its own distinct complement of biologically active venom peptides. Nevertheless, all fish-hunting Conus venoms examined so far inhibit neuromuscular transmission. In all cases, one major molecular target involved in this inhibition is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; BTX, bungarotoxin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; BTX, bungarotoxin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. at the neuromuscular junction. Thus, all fish-hunting cone snail venoms appear to contain a major venom peptide which, like the snake toxin α-bungarotoxin, potently inhibits the postsynaptic nAChR by competitively blocking the acetylcholine (ACh) binding site. Despite this common mechanism of action, there are considerable differences in the structures of the nAChR-antagonist peptides in the venoms of various fish-hunting cone snails. The major family of such peptides identified so far are the α-conotoxins, which have been characterized from several species of Indo-Pacific fish-hunting cone snails (1Myers R.A. Cruz L.J. Rivier J. Olivera B.M. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 1923-1936Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Recently, a peptide which is a competitive nAChR antagonist was purified and characterized from the Eastern Pacific piscivorousConus species, Conus purpurascens (the purple cone) (2Hopkins C.

This peptide, αA-PIVA, has a disulfide framework entirely different from all other competitive nAChR antagonists fromConus. The peptide has three disulfide bonds instead of the two usually found in α-conotoxins. Furthermore, no obvious homology is detected between α- and αA-conotoxins when their sequences are aligned. Thus, the isolation of αA-PIVA suggests that there may be two major groups of competitive nicotinic antagonists in the venom of fish-hunting cone snails, the α- and the αA-conotoxins. Perhaps the most closely related fish-hunting Conus species to C. purpurascens is the “turtle” cone, Conus ermineus, which is found throughout the tropical Atlantic (see Fig. 1). However, the first nAChR antagonist which we purified from C. ermineus venom was not homologous to αA-PIVA, but was instead a highly divergent α-conotoxin, α-EI (3Martinez J.S. Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Craig A.G. Groebe D.R. Abramson S.N. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14519-14526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that in addition to α-EI, the venom of C. ermineus contains two other nicotinic antagonists, which are αA-conotoxins by virtue of their structural homology to αA-PIVA. The discovery of these two peptides, αA-conotoxins EIVA and EIVB, expands the membership of the αA-conotoxin family and provides initial structure-function information which will be useful for studies using this family of nicotinic antagonists. The three-dimensional structures of α-conotoxins GI (4Guddat L.W. Martin J.A. Shan L. Edmundson A.B. Gray W.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11329-11335Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and PnIA are known (5Hu S.-H. Gehrmann J. Guddat L.W. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Martin J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 417-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and that of the first αA-conotoxin was recently solved. 2Han, K. H., Hwang, K. J., Kim, S. K., Gray, W. R., Olivera, B. M., Rivier, J., and Shon, K. J. (1997)Biochemistry 36, 1669–1677.2Han, K. H., Hwang, K. J., Kim, S. K., Gray, W. R., Olivera, B. M., Rivier, J., and Shon, K. J. (1997)Biochemistry 36, 1669–1677. Thus, the α- and αA-conotoxins now provide two sets of ligands of known three-dimensional structure that can be used to probe the ligand binding sites of nAChRs in vertebrate muscle. We demonstrate here that the new αA-conotoxins have a selectivity profile which differs from both the α-conotoxins and α-bungarotoxin. Crude venom was obtained from milkings ofC. ermineus kept in aquaria. The venom was stored at −70 °C until used. Trifluoroacetic acid (sequencing grade) was from Aldrich, acetonitrile (UV grade) was from Baxter, and [125]α-BTX was from NEN Life Science Products. Individual milkings of C. ermineus venom (2Hopkins C. Grilley M. Miller C. Shon K.-J. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. Dykert J. Rivier J. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. J. Biol.

The concentrate was mixed with 3 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid just prior to application onto an HPLC column. Purification of the paralytic toxin was monitored by injecting fractions into goldfish as described previously (3Martinez J.S. Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Craig A.G. Groebe D.R. Abramson S.N. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14519-14526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The HPLC apparatus consisted of HPXL pumps and either a Dynamax model UVI or UV-DII detector (Rainin, Woburn, MA). All columns were also from Rainin. For isolation of peptide from venom and all subsequent purifications, buffer A consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and buffer B was 0.092% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile. Initial purification of αA-EIVA from milked venom was accomplished using a semipreparative C18 Vydac column (10 mm × 25 cm, 5-μm particle size), with a flow rate of 5.0 ml/min. Subsequent purification steps of αA-EIVA utilized an analytical C18 Microsorb or Vydac column (4.6 mm × 25 cm, 5-μm particle size) with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Purified peptides were reduced by dithiothreitol, alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine, and HPLC-purified by previously described methods (3Martinez J.S. Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Craig A.G. Groebe D.R. Abramson S.N. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14519-14526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed by an Applied Biosystems Model 477A protein sequencer at the Protein/DNA Core Facility at the University of Utah Cancer Center. Liquid secondary ionization mass spectra were measured using a Jeol HX110 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) double-focusing mass spectrometer operated at a 10-kV accelerating voltage and a nominal resolution of 3000. The sample (in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 25% acetonitrile) was mixed in a glycerol/3-nitrobenzyl alcohol matrix (1:1) and analyzed with an electric field/accelerating voltage scan over a narrow mass range. The mass accuracy of the HX110 instrument under these conditions was typically better than 50 ppm. Peptides were built on Rink amide resin using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an ABI Model 431A peptide synthesizer. Coupling was carried out using equimolar amounts of amino acid derivative, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Amino acid side chains were protected as follows: Asp, trans-4-hydroxyproline (Hyp), Ser, Thr, Tyr (tert-butyl); Cys, His (trityl); Lys (tert-butoxycarbonyl) and Arg (pentamethylchromansulfonyl). Linear peptides were released from resin (typically 100 mg), deprotected, and precipitated as detailed previously (7Shon K.-J. Hasson A. Spira M.E. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M.

After precipitation, pelleted peptides were readily soluble in 60% acetonitrile, 0.092% trifluoroacetic acid in H20. Peptides were purified by HPLC using Vydac C18 columns and eluted with buffers containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H20 (buffer A) and 60% acetonitrile, 0.092% trifluoroacetic acid in H20 (buffer B). Typically a linear gradient of 10–50% buffer B over 40 min was used. The linear peptides were first purified on a preparative HPLC column (22 mm × 25 cm, 10-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size, flow 20 ml/min). Following this, disulfide bonds were formed by oxidation with glutathione. Ten ml of 100 mm I2 in MeOH was added to 100 ml of 80 mm glutathione in H20 to make a stock solution of 40 mm reduced (GSH) and 20 mm oxidized (GSSG) glutathione. This solution was added to HPLC effluent containing linear peptide to make a final concentration of 1 mm GSH, 0.5 mm GSSG. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 using dry Tris base or 0.75 m dibasic sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.7), and the solution was incubated ∼20 h at room temperature. The resulting mixture of oxidized peptides potentially contained 15 isomers with different disulfide arrangements. The major product was purified on a preparative column followed by isocratic purification at 21% buffer B on a semipreparative column (10 mm x 25 cm, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size, flow 3 ml/min). Based on HPLC co-elution experiments and biological activity in goldfish, it was determined that both αA-EIVA and αA-EIVB are the major products under the oxidation conditions used. cRNA encoding nAChR subunits was prepared and injected into Xenopus oocytes as described previously (8Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected 1–2 days after harvesting and used for voltage clamp recording 1–7 days after injection. “α1β1γ” and “α1β1δ” receptors were expressed by omitting cRNA for either the δ or γ subunit, respectively, from the usual α1βγδ cRNA injection mixture used to express wild-type muscle receptors (9Charnet P. Labarca C. Lester H.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 708-717Google Scholar, 10Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Voltage clamp recording was done as described previously (8Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were clamped at −70 mV with a two-electrode system and perfused with ND96 containing 1 μm atropine (to block any endogenous muscarinic acetylcholine receptors). ND96 consists of 96 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.1–7.5). ACh-gated currents were elicited with 1-s pulses of 10 μm ACh (for Torpedo and mouse α1β1γ and α1β1δ nAChRs), 1 μm ACh (for wild-type muscle nAChRs), 300 μm (for α4β2, α3β2, and α3β4 nAChRs), and 1 mm ACh (for α7 nAChRs), applied at a frequency of 1/min, except for α4β2 receptors which were pulsed every 3 min to avoid desensitization. To elicit currents sufficient for recording a 10-fold higher concentration of ACh was necessary with α1β1γ and α1β1δ compared with wild-type nAChRs. When both ACh concentrations were tested on the wild-type muscle receptors the same toxin affinity was observed (data not shown). These results were expected given the short duration of ACh exposure during test pulses and the comparatively slow dissociation rate of the toxin. The ACh applied was approximately the lowest concentration required to elicit maximal current responses at each receptor subtype. For the muscle and Torpedo receptors, however, a submaximal concentration was chosen to allow the typically large current reponses to be voltage-clamped. Toxins were applied in ND96 containing 1 μm atropine and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Exposure to each concentration of αA-EIVA or αA-EIVB was continued until the peak amplitudes of the ACh-gated currents reached a steady state. The average peak amplitude of at least four control responses recorded in the absence of toxin was used to normalize the response at each toxin concentration to obtain the “fractional response.” After application of toxin, the perfusion medium was switched back to ND96 with atropine. All kinetic and dose-response curves were generated using Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Dose-response curves were fit to the equation: fraction response = 1/(1 + ([toxin]/IC50) n H) where n H is the Hill coefficient. It is assumed that the toxin (T) reversibly binds to its receptor site (S) according to the scheme,T+S*kon⇔koff*TSSCHEME*1with forward and reverse rate constantsk on and k off, respectively. It is also assumed that the amount of toxin greatly exceeds the number of sites, and thus the forward reaction follows pseudo-first order kinetics. We define p(t) as the probability that a site is occupied by toxin at time tand q(t) as the probability that the site is unoccupied; so q(t) = (1 −p(t). If the system is initially at equilibrium, then when the concentration of toxin is perturbed to a new concentration [T], the toxin occupancy of the site will relax to a new equilibrium value exponentially with a rate constantk = (k on[T] +k off) (see e.g. Ref. 6Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes.2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Thus,p will follow a time course from its initial valuep(0) to its new equilibrium value p(∞) according to the equationp(t)=[p(0)−p(∞)]e−kt+p(∞)Equation 1 which rearranged yieldsp(t)=p(0)e−kt+p(∞)[1−e−kt]Equation 2 Note that since p(0) and p(∞) are equilibrium values before and after the toxin concentration was perturbed (say from [T 0] to [T]), their values are given by the well-known relationship described by a rectangular hyperbola or binding isotherm, that isp(0)=11+koffkon[T0]Equation 3 andp(∞)=11+koffkon[T]Equation 4 It is also assumed that each receptor has Nindependent toxin-binding sites, and that occupancy of a single site is sufficient to inactivate the receptor. Then the probability that a receptor is active would be given by the probability thatnone of the sites on the receptor is occupied, and this in turn is given by the product of the probabilities of each site beingunoccupied; in other words, the fraction of receptors that are active, FA(t), is given byq N (t) if the binding sites are kinetically equivalent. If sites are not equivalent,FA(t) is the product of probabilitiesFA(t)=∏i=1N*qi(t)Equation 5 where q i represents the probability that theith site is unoccupied. Substituting the relationship in Equation 2 for (1 − p(t)) gives the following term for q(t)q(t)=(1−p(0)e−kt−p(∞)[1−e−kt])Equation 6 which rearranged yieldsq(t)=(1+[p(∞)−p(0)]e−kt−p(∞))Equation 7 When k, p(0), and p(∞) are replaced with their expanded versions given above, this yieldsq(t)=1+11+koffkon[T]−11+koffkon[T0]e−(kon[T]+koff)t−11+koffkon[T]Equation 8 Thus, for nAChRs with two nonequivalent binding sites, where occupation of either site is sufficient to block receptor function, the fraction of active receptors is given byFA(t)=∏i=1N*qi(t)=q1(t)·q2(t)Equation 9 with q i (t) specified by Equation 8using the respective k on andk off for each site. Note that when the initial concentration of toxin is zero (i.e. [T 0] = 0), then Equation8 reduces toq(t)=1−1−e−(kon[T]+koff)t1+koffkon[T]Equation 10 Conversely, when the toxin is washed out (i.e.[T] = 0) following equilibration with a toxin concentration of [T 0], Equation 8 reduces toq(t)=1−11+koffkon[T0]e−kofftEquation 11 Our experiments monitored FA(t) with pulses of ACh that produced brief responses (time to peak ∼1 s). Thus, the receptors are exposed to ACh only for a relatively short time compared with the off-kinetics of the toxin (1/k off) ∼1 min), and ACh has only minimal opportunity to displace toxin from the receptors. We therefore assumed that the pulses of ACh did not perturb the binding of toxin to receptor. To simplify the curve-fitting of toxin wash-out, the binding isotherm p(0), used to describe the initial conditions in Equation 11, was replaced by a variable, 1 −y min, and final conditions were described by a second variable, y max, yielding the equationy = (y max − [1 −y min] e−kofft)N. The values for k off were then used in Equation10 to fit toxin wash-in curves and calculate k onvalues. Binding methods were as described previously (3Martinez J.S. Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Craig A.G. Groebe D.R. Abramson S.N. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14519-14526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, BC3H-1 cells were incubated in 250 μl of assay buffer (140 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.7 mm MgSO4, 0.06 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) with or without αA-conotoxin EIVA.125I-α-BTX (10 μl, final concentration 20 nm) was then added, and the reaction was allowed to incubate for an additional 15 min. Cells were then washed twice with 2.0 ml of assay buffer to remove unbound ligands, and receptor-bound125I-α-BTX was removed from the wells with two 0.5-ml washes of 1% Triton X-100 in water and counted in a γ counter. Nonspecific binding was determined with cells previously exposed to 100 nm α-BTX for 30 min. The total density of125I-α-BTX binding sites was determined from a 60-min incubation in the absence of competing drug. Approximately 60–70% of the total specific 125I-α-BTX binding sites were labeled by 125I-BTX during the 15 min of the assays. All assays were performed at room temperature in triplicate. Crude venom from C. ermineus obtained by milking snails was fractionated by HPLC. The elution pattern of two of the peptides paralytic to fish are shown in Fig.2. These venom fractions were subfractionated until the peptides were purified to homogeneity. Disulfide bridges were reduced, and cysteines were alkylated prior to sequencing. Their amino acid sequences are as follows.GCCGPYONAACHOCGCKVGROOYCDROSGGEquation EA GCCGK¯YONAACHOCGCT¯VGROOYCDROSGGEquation EB SEQUENCE*1These sequences were confirmed by mass spectrometry (MH+ = 3095.2 and 3099.1); these values are consistent with the peptides amidated at their C termini and with all of the Cys residues in disulfide linkages (calculated mass 3095.2 and 3099.2). Based on the putative sequences, the two peptides were synthesized by solid-state methods as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The linear peptides were oxidized to form disulfide linkages. When air oxidation was used, the material corresponding to native peptide was not formed in high yield (data not shown). However, when glutathione oxidation was performed the major products corresponded to natural peptides by the criteria described below (Fig. 3,A and B). These major products were purified to homogeneity. The cleavage of 100 mg of resin typically yielded 5–10 mg of biologically active peptide product. When co-injected on HPLC the purified, chemically synthesized peptides co-eluted with the corresponding native peptide, as shown in Fig. 3,C and D. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the molecular masses of synthetic peptides are consistent with the predicted sequences (MH+ = 3095.2 and 3099.2; calculated mass 3095.19 and 3099.18). Furthermore, the paralytic activity of the synthetic peptides was quantitatively the same as that of the native peptides when injected into goldfish (data not shown). Thus, under glutathione oxidation conditions these peptides appear to form the disulfide linkages necessary to confer biological activity. Due to the limited availability of natural peptides, all subsequent experiments were performed with synthetic material. The peptide sequences have considerable homology with that of αA-PIVA, which has been shown to be an antagonist of the nAChR at the neuromuscular junction. Given the strong homology between the peptides from C. purpurascens and C. ermineus, our initial hypothesis was that the C. ermineus peptides cause paralysis because they are also nAChR antagonists. To directly assess the functional effects of these peptides, electrophysiological experiments were carried out with cloned skeletal muscle nAChRs expressed inXenopus oocytes. Fig.4 A shows the results obtained when the peptides were tested on oocytes expressing TorpedonAChRs. It is clear that both peptides are potent inhibitors of ACh-gated currents under these conditions, with nearly identical IC50 values. Given these results and the structural homology to αA-PIVA, we designate these peptides as αA-conotoxins EIVA and EIVB. α-MI is typical of many α-conotoxins from Indo-Pacific fish-huntingConus venoms in that it prefers the α/δ over the α/γ interface of the mouse muscle nAChR (11Kreienkamp H.-J.

We compared the affinity of αA-EIVA for each interface by using receptors expressed in oocytes in which only cRNA for the mouse muscle α1, β1, δ or α1, β1, γ subunits was injected, forcing the formation of receptors with only α/δ or α/γ interfaces, respectively (9Charnet P. Labarca C. Lester H.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 708-717Google Scholar, 10Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, 10 nmα-bungarotoxin was tested on these receptors in duplicate experiments. α-Bungarotoxin blocked ∼85% of the α1β1δ receptor response and ∼92% of the α1β1γ receptor response after 15 min of exposure to toxin (data not shown). Fig. 4 Bshows the potency of αA-EIVA when tested on α1β1δγ nAChRs, termed wild-type receptors, and on the subunit-deficient variations of this receptor. These results differ markedly from those previously shown for α-MI, which prefers α1β1δ receptors with a discrimination index of 104 (14Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The IC50values of αA-EIVA for wild-type, α1β1δ, and α1β1γ receptors are almost identical. Thus, it appears that both the α1/δ and α1/γ interfaces are high affinity targets for αA-EIVA. The wild-type mouse muscle nAChR is known to contain ACh binding sites at the α1/δ and α1/γ subunit interfaces (15Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), both of which must be occupied by agonist to activate the receptor. Receptors containing only α1β1δ or α1β1γ subunits have also been shown to contain two agonist binding sites which behave pharmacologically as a single class with respect to competitive antagonist binding (10Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To calculate the rate constantsk on and k off for the interaction of αA-EIVA with α1β1δ and α1β1γ receptors, we used the model with two equivalent competitive antagonist binding sites (at the two α1/δ or two α1/γ interfaces) in which binding to either site is sufficient to inhibit receptor function (10Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Taylor P. Brown R.D. Johnson D.A. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1983; 18: 407-444Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since the wild-type receptor contains both an α1/δ and an α1/γ toxin binding site, the receptor should exhibit kinetics consistent with both sites. In fact, this is what was observed. Fig.5 shows the time course of αA-EIVA block and recovery from block on α1β1δ, α1β1γ, and wild-type mouse muscle nAChRs. The parametersk on, k off, andK d for these receptors are summarized in TableI. As shown in Fig. 5, use of the kinetic values calculated from α1β1δ and α1β1γ receptors provides a good description of block and recovery from block by αA-EIVA on the wild-type receptor.Table IAssociation and dissociation constants of αA-EIVA for nAChRs containing the indicated subunitskon(×107)koffCalculated site K d 1-aThe calculated K d (koff/kon) is a measure of toxin affinity for a single binding site.Predicted IC501-bThe IC50 measures the functional block of receptor by toxin, presumably through binding at either of two pharmacologically equivalent binding sites present on a single receptor.

Open table in a new tab The observed rates of both block and recovery from block by toxin was more rapid for α1β1δ versus α1β1γ receptors. For the wild-type receptor, the observed rate of toxin block was relatively fast, like that of the α1β1δ receptor. In contrast, the rate of recovery from toxin block for wild-type receptor was slower, comparable to that observed for the α1β1γ receptor. Thus, the kinetics of block of wild-type receptor appear to be dictated primarily by the faster toxin association rate of the α1/δ site, while the rate of recovery of receptor function following toxin wash-out is primarily influenced by the slower dissociation rate of the α1/γ site. This is the expected result if binding of toxin to a single agonist site is sufficient to block receptor function. To investigate further the target specificity of αA-EIVA, we tested its activity on the α7 subtype of neuronal nAChRs. No detectable block of ACh-gated currents was observed in α7-expressing oocytes perfused with 1 μm αA-EIVA or upon exposure to 60 μm toxin in a static bath (data not shown). We also tested αA-EIVA on oocytes expressing α4β2, α3β2, or α3β4 nAChRs. 1 μm toxin (applied by perfusion) blocked α4β2 receptors ∼25% but failed to block α3β2 or α3β4 nAChRs (n = 3).

The possibility thus exists that a certain CNG channel functions in gustation as well. In the present study, we carried out reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and genomic DNA cloning and characterized a CNG channel (CNGgust) as a cyclic nucleotide-activated species expressed in rat tongue epithelial tissues where taste reception takes place. Several types of 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends clones of CNGgust cDNA were obtained with various 5′-terminal sequences. As the CNGgust gene was a single copy, the formation of such CNGgust variants should result from alternative splicing. The encoded protein was homologous to known vertebrate CNG channels with 50–80% similarities in amino acid sequence, and particularly homologous to bovine testis CNG channel and human cone CNG channel with 82% similarities. CNGgust was functional when expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, where it opened upon the addition of cGMP or cAMP. Immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody raised against a CNGgust peptide demonstrated the channel to be localized on the pore side of each taste bud in the circumvallate papillae, with no signal observed for degenerated taste buds after denervation of the glossopharyngeal nerve. All these results, together with the indication that cyclic nucleotides play a role gustatory signaling pathway(s), strongly suggest the involvement of CNGgust in taste signal transduction.

Several types of 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends clones of CNGgust cDNA were obtained with various 5′-terminal sequences. As the CNGgust gene was a single copy, the formation of such CNGgust variants should result from alternative splicing. The encoded protein was homologous to known vertebrate CNG channels with 50–80% similarities in amino acid sequence, and particularly homologous to bovine testis CNG channel and human cone CNG channel with 82% similarities. CNGgust was functional when expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, where it opened upon the addition of cGMP or cAMP. Immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody raised against a CNGgust peptide demonstrated the channel to be localized on the pore side of each taste bud in the circumvallate papillae, with no signal observed for degenerated taste buds after denervation of the glossopharyngeal nerve. All these results, together with the indication that cyclic nucleotides play a role gustatory signaling pathway(s), strongly suggest the involvement of CNGgust in taste signal transduction. Vertebrate sensory systems comprise several distinct organs, cell types, and cellular signalings. These systems share many common features in their transmission and amplification of signals intercellularly or intracellularly leading to sense transduction to the central nervous system. Vision is the most characteristic sensory process in vertebrates. Vision involves membrane receptors (rhodopsins) catching light, signal transducers such as transducin and phosphodiesterase, a soluble second messenger (cGMP), and membrane components such as a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) 1The abbreviations used are: CNG, cyclic nucleotide gated; nt, nucleotide; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: CNG, cyclic nucleotide gated; nt, nucleotide; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s).channel, all of which cooperate in the transduction of light signals to the central nervous system (1Yau K.-W. Baylor D.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 289-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Although this molecular apparatus is thought to be specific to vision, it is believed that similar signaling pathways exist for other sensory processes such as olfaction and gustation (2Buck L.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 517-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 3Kinnamon S.C. Margolskee R.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In olfactory neuron cells, olfactory receptors encoded by more than 1000 genes (4Ressler K.J. Sullivan S.L. Buck L.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a specific GTP-binding protein (G-protein) (Golf) (5Jones D.T. Reed R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 790-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), and a CNG channel (6Dhallan R.S. Yau K.-W. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Nature. 1990; 347: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) have been identified. One intriguing fact is that each olfactory neuron expresses one or a few receptor genes from a very large gene family, which strongly suggests that a certain receptor molecule determines the specificity for ligands (odorants) (4Ressler K.J. Sullivan S.L. Buck L.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A similar situation has been implicated in taste chemoreception. We have identified multiple seven-transmembrane receptors similar to olfactory receptors that may participate in gustatory signaling (7Abe K. Kusakabe Y. Tanemura K. Emori Y. Arai S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated by in situ hybridization (8Abe K. Kusakabe Y. Tanemura K. Emori Y. Arai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12033-12039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and immunostaining (9Kusakabe Y. Abe K. Tanemura K. Emori Y. Arai S. Chem. Senses. 1996; 21: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that GUST27, a representative receptor, is closely related to known olfactory receptors with a similarity of about 60% (8Abe K. Kusakabe Y. Tanemura K. Emori Y. Arai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12033-12039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is expressed exclusively in taste buds and surrounding sites. An independent group has reported similar receptors expressed in taste cells (10Matsuoka I. Mori T. Aoki J. Sato T. Kurihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Tal M. Ammar D.A. Karpuj M. Krizhanovsky V. Naim M. Thompson D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

McLaughlin et al. (13McLaughlin S.K. McKinnon P.J. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1992; 357: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and Ruiz-Avilaet al. (14Ruiz-Avila L. McLaughlin S.K. Wildman D. McKinnon P.J. Robichon A. Spickofsky N. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have confirmed the expression of gustducin, a taste bud-specific G-protein, and transducin in taste cells. Although many of the molecules present in olfactory and/or gustatory cells have not yet been proved to be involved directly in the intracellular signaling cascade, those that are homologous to the visual signaling process may give rise to olfactory and gustatory sensations. Recently, the functions of various specific molecules have been revealed. Knockout mice lacking the olfactory CNG channel are insensitive to most odors (15Brunet L.J. Gold G.H. Ngai J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 681-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and those lacking gustducin show greatly reduced or sometimes a complete lack of reactivity toward sweet and bitter tastants (16Wong G.T. Gannon K.S. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1996; 381: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). As described above, CNG channels may be generally positioned in the middle of the intracellular signaling pathway of a chemosensation. Despite that, there have been no reports of the existence or function of CNG channel(s) in the gustatory system, with the interesting exception that there is a cyclic nucleotide-suppressible conductance/channel in frog taste cells (17Kolesnikov S.S. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the present study, we carried out experiments aimed at finding and characterizing a mammalian gustatory CNG channel that is activated by cyclic nucleotides. The present report is the first that deals with a CNG channel occurring in taste buds. It also concerns the location of this gustatory CNG channel, CNGgust, on the pore side of each taste bud. Incidentally, it is noted that in this report CNGgust is sometimes specified as cyclic nucleotide-activated channel to distinguish it from the cyclic nucleotide-suppressible one (17Kolesnikov S.S. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from the tongue epithelia of rat circumvallate papillae using oligo(dT)-cellulose. A first-strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primer and a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia). Two degenerate oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GGITCIATGAT(ATC)TCIAA(TC)ATGAA(TC)GC-3′ and 5′-AG(TC)TTICC(TC)TC(TC)TT(GAT)AT(GAT)AT(GA)TACAT(TC)TC(TC)TT-3′, were synthesized according to the amino acid sequences GSMISNMNA and KEMYIIKEGKL, respectively, which are commonly conserved in the COOH-terminal cytosolic region of known CNG channels. PCR amplification was performed using the primers (1 μm each) and rat tongue epithelial cDNA as a template (45 s at 96 °C, 2 min at 45 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, 50 cycles). The amplified DNA fragments of about 380 bp were excised and subcloned into pBluescript KS vector. To obtain clones for CNG channel, another oligonucleotide, 5′-GTCCAIA(GA)(GA)TA(GA)TC(GA)AACCA(TC)TT(GAT)ATIAC-3′, was prepared as a probe according to the sequence VIKWFDYLW. To identify the cDNA corresponding to the RT-PCR fragment encoding the CNG channel named CNGgust, genomic DNA cloning and 5′-RACE were carried out. One million plaques from a rat genomic DNA library (kindly supplied by Dr. E. Kominami, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo) were screened with the 32P-labeled RT-PCR fragment encoding CNGgust. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C and washing at 65 °C in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. The positive clone obtained, designated λ2, was subcloned into pUC18 vector and sequenced. 5′-RACE was carried out to determine the nucleotide sequence of the 5′-end of the CNGgust cDNA as follows. Poly(A+) RNA from rat tongue epithelia was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the antisense oligonucleotide primer 5′-TGAAGTGCAAGGTC-3′ (+498 to +511 nt in Fig. 2), which is included in the λ2 genomic DNA fragment. An oligo(dA)-tail was added by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The oligo(dA)-tailed cDNA was amplified (30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, 50 cycles) using an oligo(dT) primer, 5′-GAGTCGACTCGAGAATTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′, and a specific primer according to the nucleotide sequence of the λ2 genomic DNA fragment, 5′-GTTTCCACAGCCTCTTGG-3′ (+470 to +487 nt, Fig. 2). The products were subcloned into a pUC 18 vector and sequenced. To obtain a full-length open reading frame of CNGgust cDNA, a random primed rat tongue epithelial cDNA was amplified using specific primers, 5′-TTCAGGATGCATCAGATG-3′ (−6 to +12 nt, Fig.2) of the 5′-RACE clone and 5′-GGATCCAACAACACTCTC-3′ (+2183 to +2200 nt, Fig. 2) of the λ2 genomic DNA fragment (30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, 50 cycles). A 10-μg portion of rat genomic DNA (CLONTECH) was digested with restriction endonuclease, EcoRI, BamHI, or PstI, electrophoresed, and transferred to a nylon filter. The filter was hybridized at 65 °C with the 32P-labeled RT-PCR fragment encoding CNGgust (+961 to +1343 nt in Fig. 2) and then washed at 65 °C in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. CNGgust expression plasmid pSRD-CNG was used for transient expression. pSRD-CNG was constructed as follows. pCNGg1 containing a 2.5 kb-BamHI fragment of λ2 was digested withStuI and SalI, and ligated with a StuI and SalI fragment of a 5′-RACE clone, pCNG5′-1, to generate a 2.2-kb insert encoding the full length of the coding region. The insert (−6 to +1836 nt in Fig. 2) was amplified and subcloned into the pSRD vector, yielding pSRD-CNG. The transient expression of CNGgust was performed by transfecting the expression plasmid pSRD-CNG into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). pAdVAntage (Promega) and a green fluorescent protein-expressing vector, pS64T-C1 (CLONTECH) were co-transfected with the expression plasmid. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 2 or 3 days. Electrical recordings were performed using green fluorescent protein-expressing cells. The current was recorded from inside-out patches using an EPC-7 amplifier (List Electronic) with the current filtered at 2 kHz. The pipette and bath solution used was 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The inside-out patch was held at 0 mV in the bath solution containing cGMP or cAMP and stepped from −75 mV to +90 mV for 30 ms, increasing the voltage by 15 mV every 1 s. The current was measured 5 ms before the ending of the voltage pulse. The COOH-terminal 15-mer peptide of CNGgust, FSPDRENSEDASKAD, was synthesized, and a cysteine residue was added to its NH2 terminus to conjugate the peptide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Rabbit antiserum was prepared by immunizing the synthetic peptide conjugated to hemocyanin. An anti-CNGgust antibody was affinity-purified by a peptide column. Rats were anesthetized and their tongues were rapidly excised. The excised tongues were immediately embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Miles Labs.), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and serially sectioned at 5-μm thickness. Sections containing circumvallate papillae were thaw-mounted onto glass slides, air-dried, and fixed for 10 min in 10% formaldehyde/PBS. The sections were preincubated with normal goat serum and subsequently immunoreacted with a diluted solution of the affinity-purified anti-CNGgust antibody (1:100 in PBS) overnight. After washing with PBS, the slide was incubated with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100 in PBS) for 30 min and observed using a fluorescent microscope. To promote degeneration of the taste buds in circumvallate papillae, the glossopharyngeal nerve was removed. This treatment was performed on 5-week-old male rats by the method described previously (18Ninomiya Y. Kajiura H. Naito Y. Mochizuki K. Katsukawa H. Torii K. Physiol. Behav. 1994; 56: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Sections containing circumvallate papillae were excised 6 weeks after denervation and used for immunostaining as described above. We first tried to obtain cDNA fragments encoding a CNG channel by RT-PCR with mRNA prepared from the epithelia of rat circumvallate papillae. Degenerated oligonucleotide primers corresponding to highly conserved sequences in the COOH-terminal cytosolic regions of known CNG channels were used for the RT-PCR. Resulting products with the expected nucleotide lengths of about 380 bp were subcloned and screened with an internal oligonucleotide probe corresponding to another conserved CNG channel sequence. By this method, we isolated a clone, designated pch 12, encoding a part of the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (Figs.1 and 2). From a data base search, the deduced amino acid sequence was found to be part of a CNG channel as a cyclic nucleotide-activated one, and so was named CNGgust. Next, we tried to obtain a full-length cDNA for CNGgust. Because no appreciable expression of CNGgust mRNA was observed by Northern blot analysis even using 10 μg of poly(A+) RNA extracted from rat tongue epithelial tissues (data not shown), it was considered very difficult to obtain any positive cDNA clone from a conventional cDNA library. Therefore, we obtained a genomic DNA fragment to determine a part of the CNGgust cDNA and then carried out 5′-RACE and RT-PCR. Since it is known that the 3′ two-thirds of the cDNA for the human rod CNG channel consists of a single exon (19Dhallan R.S. Macke J.P. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Reed R.R. Yau K.-W. Nathans J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3248-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a genomic DNA fragment containing a sequence of the RT-PCR clone (pch 12) was expected to code for the greater part of CNGgust. We then isolated a genomic DNA clone, termed λ2, by screening with pch 12 as a probe. Restriction mapping, Southern hybridization, and sequence analysis indicated that the 2.5-kbBamHI fragment contained a pch 12 sequence (Fig. 1) and that a single exon in this fragment encoded the COOH-terminal part of CNGgust, Phe147–Asp611 (Fig. 2). It was also suggested that the fragment contained at least the 3′-noncoding sequence and that exon(s) encoding the NH2-terminal part should be split by intron(s). To determine the sequence of the 5′-terminal region of the CNGgust cDNA, we next carried out 5′-RACE using a specific antisense primer corresponding to +470 to +487 nt (Fig. 2). As a result, several 5′-RACE clones were obtained. All had the same 3′-regional 446-bp sequence, but their 5′-regional sequences varied (data not shown). This variation was thought to result from alternative splicing, since the CNGgust gene is a single copy as revealed by genomic Southern analysis which yielded a single band under stringent conditions for digestion with EcoRI,BamHI, and PstI using the pch 12 insert (+961 to +1343 nt in Fig. 2) as a probe (Fig. 3). The lengths of the DNA fragments detected by genomic Southern analysis were consistent with the restriction map of λ2 (Figs. 1 and 3). A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the clone λ2 with that of 5′-RACE clones showed the partial organization of CNGgust gene. Two exons, 108 bp (+222 to +329 nt) and 107 bp (+330 to +436 nt) in length, are located separately (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of CNGgust cDNA. The nucleotide sequence was based on the λ2 genomic DNA clone and the most abundant 5′-RACE clones (−13 to +487 nt). Since the 5′-terminal CNGgust cDNA has not been definitely elucidated, the initiation methionine codon could not be assigned. The methionine residue in the most 5′-terminal region was taken as the starting position for nucleotide and amino acid numbering. Although the 3′-end of the cDNA has not been elucidated, the 2206-nt sequence (−6 to +2200 nt) (Fig. 2) containing the termination codon and part of the 3′-noncoding region was contained in one of the mRNA species, because we obtained a 2206-bp product by RT-PCR using a primer set (−6 to +12 nt and +2183 to +2200 nt in Fig. 2) and random primed cDNA from rat circumvallate papillae. CNGgust shares an overall structural similarity with other CNG channels. It contains 1) a central hydrophobic region comprising six membrane-spanning segments, 2) a pore-forming region that may determine ion permeability, and 3) a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain near the COOH terminus that locates in the cytosolic region. CNGgust also contains two potentialN-glycosylation sites (Fig.4). Fig. 4 shows an amino acid alignment of CNGgust with known CNG channels. Since the NH2-terminal sequence of CNGgust has not been definitely determined, a precise comparison of the NH2-terminal regions is not achieved. In terms of overall homology, CNGgust shows the highest similarity (82%) to bovine testis CNG channel (20Weyand I. Godde M. Frings S. Weiner J. Müller F. Altenhofen W. Hatt H. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1994; 368: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Biel M. Zong X. Distler M. Bosse E. Klugbauer N. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3505-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and the same degree of similarity to human cone CNG channel (22Yu W.-P. Grunwald M.E. Yau K.-W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, it shows lower similarities (50–70%) to other CNG channels: 66% to rat olfactory CNG channel (6Dhallan R.S. Yau K.-W. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Nature. 1990; 347: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and 63% to rat rod CNG channel (23Barnstable C.J. Wei J.-Y. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As for the central part ranging from the predicted first transmembrane region to the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, where the highest similarity has generally been observed among known CNG channels, CNGgust has a similarity as high as 85% to the bovine testis and human cone CNG channels, and a similarity of 60–70% to other vertebrate CNG channels. In the NH2-terminal region, on the other hand, CNGgust lacks the 20–40 amino acids between Gly74 and Arg75 when compared with bovine testis and human cone CNG channels (Fig. 4). It should be noted that an intron is inserted in this position of the CNGgust cDNA (Fig.2). Since known cloned CNG channels are functional when expressed in cultured cells, we expressed CNGgust in HEK 293 cells and investigated CNG channel properties. As shown in Fig.5, electrophysiological recording of CNGgust-expressing cells showed that the expressed protein in inside-out patches, although it may be missing the NH2-terminal region, can open when a cyclic nucleotide, cGMP and cAMP, is added. The current-voltage relationship was approximately linear through the change in membrane potential (+90 to −75 mV) at every nucleotide concentration tested (Fig. 5 A). The half-maximal activation constant (K½) at −60 mV was about 3 μm for cGMP, whereas it was about 300 μm for cAMP (Fig. 5 B). The sensitivity to cGMP is about 100 times higher than it is to cAMP. Further, the current observed with saturating cAMP (10 mm) was 85% of that observed with saturating cGMP (100 μm) (Fig.5 B). This ratio is similar to that reported by Biel et al. (21Biel M. Zong X. Distler M. Bosse E. Klugbauer N. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3505-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) for the bovine testis CNG channel. We observed the expression of CNGgust mRNA in the circumvallate papillae by 5′-RACE and RT-PCR. To determine the localization of CNGgust in tissue, immunostaining experiments were carried out using a polyclonal antibody raised against the COOH-terminal peptide. Intense fluorescence was observed in each of the taste buds, especially on the pore side of the apical region where taste reception followed by initial intracellular signaling may occur (Fig. 6, B and C). To examine whether or not the expression of CNGgust depends on the presence of taste buds, tongue sections from rats whose glossopharyngeal nerves connecting the tongue to the central nervous system had been destroyed were immunostained. The removal of this nerve is known to promote the degeneration of taste buds in the circumvallate papillae since regeneration no longer occurs (24Guth L. Anat. Rec. 1957; 128: 715-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The taste buds disappeared 6 weeks after denervation, and no CNGgust protein signal was observed in the corresponding region (Fig. 6 D). These results indicate that our cloned CNGgust is expressed in taste buds. In this study, we report the cloning of a CNG channel (CNGgust) as a cyclic nucleotide-activated one from rat tongue epithelia. This is the first study identifying a CNG channel in mammalian gustatory organs. CNGgust is expressed in taste buds including the taste cells where gustatory reception takes place. Our findings thus strongly indicate the possible involvement of CNGgust in the intracellular signal transduction of taste cells. CNGgust may consist of several variants judging from the results of 5′-RACE. Since the CNGgust gene is a single copy gene (Fig. 3), this variation probably results from alternative splicing that gives rise to different 5′-coding regions. Since the CNGgust derived from the most abundant type of 5′-RACE clones was shorter than other CNG channels in the NH2-terminal region (Fig. 4), a full-length CNGgust species with an additional NH2 sequence must exist. However, the CNGgust expressed in HEK cells, although not full-length, was functional as a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (Fig. 5). Electrophysiological information concerning cloned vertebrate CNG channels is available. It has been reported that cAMP is not capable of activating rod CNG channels even when a high concentration of cAMP (1 mm) is applied (23Barnstable C.J. Wei J.-Y. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Kaupp U.B. Niidome T. Tanabe T. Terada S. Bönigk W. Stühmer W. Cook N.J. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Miyata T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 342: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cAMP can activate olfactory CNG channels, but the sensitivity for cAMP is about 30 times lower than that for cGMP (6Dhallan R.S. Yau K.-W. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Nature. 1990; 347: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In our study, we showed that CNGgust responded to cAMP as well as to cGMP, although the sensitivity for cGMP was about 100 times greater than that for cAMP in terms of theK½ value (Fig. 5 B). Recently, a CNG channel has been shown to function as a hetero-oligomer of α- and β-subunits. The α-subunit has been shown to function as a CNG channel in the absence of the β-subunit. On the other hand, the β-subunit, which has been cloned from rod outer segments, olfactory neurons, and testis, does not form any functional channel by itself (26Chen T.-Y. Peng Y.-W. Dhallan R.S. Ahamed B. Reed R.R. Yau K.-W. Nature. 1993; 362: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 27Körschen H.G. Illing M. Seifert R. Sesti F. Williams A. Gotzes S. Colville C. Müller F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6349-6355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that the β-subunit increases the sensitivity for cAMP when coexpressed with the α-subunit (28Liman E.R. Buck L.B. Neuron. 1994; 13: 611-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 29Bradley J. Li J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Zinn K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus the β-subunit is considered to be a modulatory subunit. It is probable that the β-subunit per se exists in taste cells to form an α-β hetero-oligomer with the α-subunit (CNGgust), and that the resulting oligomer shows a high sensitivity for cAMP, similar to that for cGMP. The involvement of CNGgust in the taste signaling process is strongly suggested by the following findings and knowledge. First, CNGgust is expressed specifically on the pore side of each taste bud in the circumvallate papilla (Fig. 6, B and C). In addition, this site-specific expression is dependent on the existence of taste buds as shown by the denervation experiments (Fig.6 D). Second, it has been reported that taste buds contain a series of intrinsic molecules participating in the signal transduction cascade involving cyclic nucleotides. These are exemplified by G-protein-coupled receptors (8Abe K. Kusakabe Y. Tanemura K. Emori Y. Arai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12033-12039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Matsuoka I.

Third, it has been reported that the stimulation of taste cells with some sweet tastants increases their intracellular cAMP level (35Striem B.J. Naim M. Lindemann B. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1991; 1: 46-54Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Taken together, the CNGgust characterized here may be an essential mediator in cAMP/cGMP-dependent taste signaling. Recently, Kolesnikov and Margolskee (17Kolesnikov S.S. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have electrophysiologically demonstrated the occurrence of a cyclic nucleotide-suppressible conductance/channel in frog taste cells. In contrast is our finding that CNGgust, as well as many other CNG channels, is activated in the presence of cyclic nucleotides. It may therefore be appropriate to distinguish CNGgust by designating it as a cyclic nucleotide-activated rather than gated channel. However, it remains unclear whether a similar suppressible channel occurs in rat taste cells or if it is just intrinsic to frogs. If such a channel resides in mammals as well, the possibility exists that both positively and negatively controlled pathways are together involved in mammalian taste signaling, and it will be extremely interesting to define each of them at the molecular level. We express our thanks to Dr. Y. Ninomiya, Asahi University, for performing the denervation treatments, to Dr. S. Seino, Chiba University, for advice concerning the electrophysiological study, and to Dr. K. Sugimoto, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, for pertinent discussion on the histology of taste cells."

The inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) by alendronate suggests that PTPs may be molecular targets. As a clear understanding of the inhibition mechanism is lacking, our aim was to analyze the mechanism to provide further insight into its therapeutic effect. We show here that the inhibition of PTPs by alendronate in the presence of calcium followed first-order kinetic behavior, and kinetic parameters for the process were determined. Evidence is presented that the inhibition by alendronate/calcium is active site-directed. However, this process was very sensitive to assay constituents such as EDTA and dithiothreitol. Furthermore, the inhibition of PTPs by alendronate/calcium was eliminated by the addition of catalase. These observations suggest that a combination of alendronate, metal ions, and hydrogen peroxide is responsible for the inhibition of PTPs. The individual effects of alendronate, calcium, or hydrogen peroxide on the inactivation of CD45 were determined. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry demonstrated that the mass of PTP1B increased by 34 ± 2 units after the enzyme was inactivated with alendronate/calcium, due to the oxidization of the catalytic cysteine to sulfinic acid (Cys–SO2H). The inhibited PTP1B could be partially reactivated by treatment with reducing agents such as hydroxylamine (NH2OH) andN,N′-dimethyl-N,N′-bis(mercaptoacetyl)hydrazine, indicating the presence of other oxidized forms such as sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH). This further confirms that the inhibition is the result of oxidation of the catalytic cysteine. The relevance of this oxidative inhibition mechanism in a biological system is discussed.

The rationale for the therapeutic effect at the cellular level is that alendronate interferes with osteoclast resorption, resulting in reduced bone turnover and a net gain in bone mineral density (7Rodan G.A.

Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) suggests that PTP is possibly one of the targets. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases are important enzymes in living systems, acting in opposition to protein-tyrosine kinases to control the tyrosine phosphorylation level of proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role in the transduction of signals that control many diverse cell processes (10Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin.

PTPs are divided into two main groups: the receptor-like forms, such as CD45 (leukocyte common antigen); and the cytoplasmic forms, such as PTP1B. Each of the PTPs contains at least one conserved segment of ∼240 amino acid residues corresponding to the catalytic domain. Within this domain is the sequence motif (I/V)HC XAGXXR(S/T)G that uniquely defines the PTP family. The Cys residue (underlined in the sequence) is absolutely conserved and is involved in forming a thiophosphate intermediate as part of the catalytic mechanism (13Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work by Schmidt et al. (14Schmidt A. Rutledge S.J. Endo N. Opas E.E. Tanaka H. Wesolowski G. Leu C.T. Huang Z.

J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed that alendronate in the micromolar range inhibited the activity of PTPs such as PTPς and PTPε. The inhibition of PTP activity was correlated with the inhibition of in vitro osteoclast formation and bone resorption. Although these findings strongly suggest that PTPs are molecular targets of bisphosphonate action, the inhibition mechanism is not fully understood. Here we describe the inhibition of CD45 and PTP1B by alendronate and provide evidence that the oxidation of the active-site cysteine is the means of inhibition by alendronate. Tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide Lck505 (TEGQpYQPQP) and tyrosine-sulfated peptide (DIsYETD) were obtained from California Peptide Research Inc. Hydrogen peroxide (30%) was obtained from Aldrich. Sequencing-grade trypsin was supplied by Boehringer Mannheim. The calcium buffer kit and calcium green 5N were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. Bovine liver catalase, horseradish peroxidase, and all other chemicals of reagent grade came from Sigma. Fluorescein diphosphate (FDP), alendronate, andN,N′-dimethyl-N,N′-bis(mercaptoacetyl)hydrazine (DMH) were synthesized in house. The expression and purification of CD45 (16Wang, Q., Janzen, N., Ramachandran, C., and Jirik, F. (1997)Biochem. Pharmacol., in press.Google Scholar) and flag-PTP1B (17Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) have been described previously. The rates of enzyme-catalyzed dephosphorylation were determined using either FDP 2Z. Huang, Q. Wang, H. Ly, A. Gorvindarajan, J. Scheigetz, R. Zamboni, and C. Ramachandran, manuscript in preparation. or the phosphorylated peptide TEGQpYQPQP (19Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Selfer A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Chem. 1993; 211: 7-15Google Scholar) as a substrate at room temperature. In the case of FDP as a substrate, the rates were obtained by continuously monitoring the absorption of the production of fluorescein monophosphate (FMP) at 450 nm with ε450 = 27,500m−1 cm−1 or the fluorescence at an excitation of 475 nm and an emission of 515 nm. The rates using the phosphorylated peptide TEGQpYQPQP as a substrate were obtained by continuously monitoring the increase in fluorescent intensity due to the formation of free tyrosyl peptide at an excitation of 282 nm and an emission of 305 nm (19Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Selfer A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Chem. 1993; 211: 7-15Google Scholar). The assay buffer used in most experiments contained 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.5), 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 10 μm EDTA, and 1 mmcalcium chloride. For the other experiments as indicated, the buffer contained 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.5) pretreated with Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad), 1 mm DTT, and 1.0 μm free Ca2+ by adjusting the ratio of CaEGTA to EGTA (20Haugland R.P. Larison K. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 5th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1992–1994: 115-119Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in both 96-well plates and cuvettes. In the 96-well plates with FDP as a substrate, the total volume was 200 μl, and activities were measured using a Softmax 250 plate reader (Molecular Devices). In the cuvettes with FDP or the phosphorylated peptide as a substrate, the total assay volume was 1.0 ml, and activity was measured using a Perkin-Elmer luminescence spectrometer (LS 50B) or a Cary UV spectrometer. A fluorometric assay for measuring horseradish peroxidase activity using homovanillic acid as a substrate was employed to measure hydrogen peroxide (21Mevkh A.T. Sudina G.F. Golub N.B. Varfolomeev S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 100 μl of 10 mm homovanillic acid and 20 μl of 100 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase were added to 50 mm imidazole buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mmDTT, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 μm EDTA in the absence or presence of 20 μm alendronate to give a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction was followed by an increase in fluorescence at an excitation of 315 nm and an emission of 425 nm using a Perkin-Elmer luminescence spectrometer (LS 50B). The final fluorescent intensity, which corresponds to the complete depletion of hydrogen peroxide, was recorded. The actual concentration of hydrogen peroxide was calculated by comparison with a hydrogen peroxide standard curve (0–20 μm). To determine the free calcium concentration in the system, calcium green 5N was used as an indicator, and the fluorescent signal of the calcium indicator was measured using a Perkin-Elmer luminescence spectrometer (LS 50B) at an excitation of 506 nm and an emission of 530 nm. The principle of this method was described in Ref. 20Haugland R.P. Larison K. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 5th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1992–1994: 115-119Google Scholar. In our experiment, first the binding constant between calcium green 5N and calcium was determined at pH 6.5 using the standard MOPS buffer. Solution A or high calcium solution (50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 6.5) containing 10 μm EDTA, 20 μm FDP, and 50 nm calcium green 5N with 10 mm CaEGTA) and solution B or low calcium solution (50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 6.5) containing 10 μm EDTA, 20 μm FDP, and 50 nm calcium green 5N with 10 mm EGTA) were prepared. Solutions A and B were combined in specific ratios to obtain the required calcium concentration as shown in Equation 1.[Ca2+]=3728×10−9*M×[CaEGTA]/[EGTA]Equation 1 The fluorescent intensities of these solutions were measured, and a binding constant (K d) of 6.1 ± 0.4 μm (triplicate experiments) was obtained by fitting fluorescent intensity versus [Ca2+] into Equation 2.Fluorescent intensity=(capacity×[Ca2+])/(Kd+[Ca2+])+offsetEquation 2 Second, the standard curve in our assay system was generated. By applying the same K d in our assay system (50 mm imidazole buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mmDTT, 10 μm EDTA, 20 μm FDP, 4 μm H2O2, and 6 μmalendronate), the offset and capacity under the assay conditions were obtained from Equation 2. Then a standard curve of fluorescent intensity versus [Ca2+] under the assay conditions was prepared. Finally, the free calcium concentration in the kinetic experiments was obtained by measuring the fluorescent intensity in the presence of 50 nm calcium green 5N and then extrapolating the free [Ca2+] from the standard curve. PTP1B samples were prepared for MS by incubating 0.75 μm enzyme in the assay buffer (50 mm imidazole buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mmDTT and 10 μm EDTA) in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm alendronate and 1 mm calcium chloride to a total volume of 400 μl at 4 °C. The extent of inhibition of the PTP1B sample was followed at appropriate intervals by removing an aliquot of 1 μl and adding it to 200 μl of assay buffer containing 20 μm FDP to monitor the production of FMP. A control sample, which did not contain the inhibitor, was followed in parallel. After 6 h on ice, the residual activity of inhibited PTP1B was <1%, but the activity of the control sample had not significantly changed. Both samples were then concentrated using Centricon-10 concentration filters (Amicon, Inc.). After spinning at 10,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C, the final volume was ∼85 μl, and the protein concentration was ∼3.5 μm. The intact protein samples were then analyzed by capillary high pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (capillary LC-MS). This system has been described in detail previously (17Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Briefly, the capillary column consisted of a 254 μm (inner diameter) × 120-mm length of PEEK tubing packed with 10 μm of POROS® R2 (stationary phase; PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). The proteins were eluted into the electrospray ionization source of a TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) using a 15 μl/min mobile phase gradient (10–80% aqueous acetonitrile and 0.5% glacial acetic acid in 20 min). Full scan mass spectra (m/z 600–1800) were acquired in profile mode. Tryptic peptides were prepared by incubating the proteins overnight at 37 °C with sequencing-grade trypsin (1:20, w/w). The digests were analyzed by capillary LC-MS as described previously (17Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). In this instance, the tryptic peptides were resolved on a 300 μm (inner diameter) × 150-mm Hypersil C18 capillary column (Keystone Scientific Inc., Bellefonte, PA) using a 5.5 μl/min mobile phase gradient of aqueous isopropyl alcohol and 0.5% glacial acetic acid. Full scan mass spectra (m/z 300–2000) were acquired in centroid mode. CD45 (1.2 μg/ml) was preincubated with 2 μm alendronate and 1 mm calcium chloride in the assay buffer (200 μl). Then at appropriate intervals, the remaining activity was checked by removing an aliquot of 2 μl from the inactivation mixture and adding it to the assay buffer containing 20 μm FDP to measure the production of FMP. After 15 min, ∼96% inactivation had occurred. Aliquots (50 μl) of the inactivated enzyme were then added to 950 μl of (a) the assay buffer alone, (b) the assay buffer with 5 mm hydroxylamine, or (c) the assay buffer with 5 mm DMH. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 μm FDP and were monitored for the formation of FMP using a Perkin-Elmer luminescence spectrometer (LS 50B) at an excitation of 475 nm and an emission at 515 nm. When PTPs such as CD45 and PTP1B were assayed in the buffer system of 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.5) and 1 mm DTT in the presence of alendronate, a time-dependent inhibition of PTPs was observed, which was similar to that observed previously for PTPς and PTPε (14Schmidt A. Rutledge S.J. Endo N. Opas E.E. Tanaka H. Wesolowski G. Leu C.T. Huang Z. Ramachandran C. Sevgi B.R. Rodan G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1996; 11: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, as observed by Schmidt et al. 3A. Schmidt, E. Opas, personal communication. in the case of PTPς and PTPε, we also observed that the inhibition of CD45 and PTP1B was sensitive to the concentration of EDTA as shown in Fig.1. In the buffer containing 10 μm EDTA or the buffer pretreated with Chelex 100, no time-dependent inactivation was observed. Since metal chelating properties of bisphosphonates are well documented (22Nardelli N. Pelizzi G. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1983; 80: 259-271Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Lamson M.L. Fox J.L. Higuchi W.I. Int. J. Pharm. ( Amst. ). 1984; 21: 143-154Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Ostovic D. Stelmach C. Hulshizer B. Pharmacol. Res. 1993; 10: 470-472Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we suspected that alendronate chelated trace amounts of metal ions present in the imidazole buffer and that the resultant chelate(s) inhibited PTP activities. Not knowing what metal(s) were involved, we chose initially to study the effect of calcium as alendronate is used to treat bone diseases and calcium is the most abundant element in bone. The Ca2+ concentration was controlled in one of two ways: first, using the assay buffer containing 10 μm EDTA and 1 mm calcium chloride; and second, using the assay buffer treated with Chelex 100 and containing 1.0 μm free Ca2+ by adjusting the ratio of CaEGTA to EGTA (20Haugland R.P. Larison K. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 5th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1992–1994: 115-119Google Scholar). In the first case, the concentration of Ca2+ is much higher than that of EDTA to ensure that the free concentration of calcium is in excess even after the possible chelation by the buffer components. As shown in Fig. 2, CD45 was inactivated by alendronate and calcium in a time-dependent process, following first-order kinetics. The observed rate of inactivation was dependent on the alendronate concentration and was maximal at ∼20 μm. The Kitz-Wilson analysis (25Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of data yields an inactivation rate constant (k i) of 0.28 ± 0.02 min−1 and an apparent equilibrium binding constant (K i) of 2.4 ± 0.6 μm (Fig. 2,inset). The same results were obtained using a different way to measure the inactivation rate constants. 4The inactivation of CD45 by alendronate was also monitored by incubation of CD45 in 50 mm imidazole buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm DTT, 10 μm EDTA, and 1 mm CaCl2 in the presence of different concentrations (0, 6.25, and 25 μm) of alendronate. Residual enzyme activity was determined at appropriate intervals by the addition of FDP substrate (20 μm) and measurement of FMP release. Pseudo first-order rate constants (k obs) at each alendronate concentration were determined by plotting the residual activity versus time and were fitted to a first-order equation (y =a(1 − e − kt) +b) using the KaleidaGraph program (Version 3.05, Synergy Software PCS Inc.). Alendronate and calcium also inhibited the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B in a similar way, with a k i of 0.15 ± 0.01 min−1 and a K i of 5 ± 1 μm (data not shown). This inhibition does not appear to be substrate-dependent as similar results were obtained for CD45 using the phosphotyrosyl peptide Lck505 (TEGQpYQPQP), derived from the C terminus of the Lck sequence, as an alternative substrate (K i of 4 ± 0.9 μm andk i of 0.23 ± 0.02 min−1) (data not shown). Furthermore, we investigated whether the inactivation by alendronate and calcium occurs at the active site. First, the inhibition of CD45 by alendronate was found to be competitive with the FDP substrate. The inactivation rate constant dropped from 0.21 ± 0.02 min−1 at 20 μm FDP to 0.041 ± 0.006 min−1 at 200 μm FDP (data not shown). As shown by Huang et al.,2 the hydrolysis of FDP by PTPs is via the active-site cysteine, as it is for phosphorylated peptide substrates; thus, the competition between FDP and alendronate suggested that the inhibition occurs at the active site. Second, alendronate competes with a tyrosine-sulfated peptide inhibitor for the inhibition of PTPs. Tyrosine-sulfated peptide (DIsYETD) inhibits CD45 with an IC50 of 7 μm, 5S. Desmarais, Z. Jia, C. Ramachandran, unpublished results. and the inhibition is reversible and competitive with substrate (data not shown). Incubation of CD45 with 12 μm tyrosine-sulfated peptide reduced the apparent inactivation rate constant from 0.2 ± 0.02 to 0.027 ± 0.004 min−1 (Fig.3). This suggests that the two ligands are competing for the same site. During the studies of the effects of alendronate on the inhibition of PTPs, we observed inconsistent results even after controlling Ca2+concentration in the assay buffer. It had previously been observed by Huyer et al. (17Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) that in situ generation of H2O2 in the assay buffer system, in combination with vanadate, could cause an irreversible inactivation of PTPs by oxidizing the catalytic cysteine. H2O2is likely generated by the presence of trace metal ions in imidazole buffer, 6ICP (Inductive coupled plasma) analysis of the assay buffer showed that it contained mostly Cu2+ as a metal impurity. which are capable of catalyzing the reduction of O2 to H2O2 by DTT (26Percival M.D. Denis D.

In the absence of alendronate and calcium, the catalase did not significantly affect the activity of CD45. However, the inhibition of CD45 by alendronate and calcium was eliminated in the presence of catalase (Fig.4). This observation certainly raised the possibility that the observed inactivation of PTPs by alendronate and calcium was due solely to H2O2. To address this possibility, we decided to carry out the following experiments: (a) to determine the concentration of H2O2 in the assay system and (b) to determine the inhibitory potency of added H2O2for CD45 in the absence of alendronate and calcium. The concentration of H2O2 under the assay conditions (50 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 μm EDTA (pH 6.5)) was determined to be ∼3 μm using the fluorometric method (21Mevkh A.T. Sudina G.F. Golub N.B. Varfolomeev S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Alendronate does not generate H2O2 since the concentration of H2O2 was not changed in the same buffer system containing 20 μm alendronate. Since HEPES buffer (>99.5% purity) contains less trace metal impurities than imidazole buffer (99% purity) and was found to contain much smaller amounts of H2O2 (∼0.3 μm), 50 mm HEPES containing 1 mmDTT (pH 7.0) was used in the determination of the inhibitory potency of H2O2 for CD45. H2O2inactivated CD45 in a time-dependent process, following first-order kinetics. The observed rates of inhibition were dependent on H2O2 concentration, with an inactivation dissociation constant (K i) of 200 ± 1 μm (data not shown). Therefore, the K i is ∼70-fold higher than the H2O2concentration in the imidazole assay buffer. Obviously, the low concentration of H2O2 present in the imidazole buffer cannot account for the observed inactivation of CD45 in the presence of alendronate and calcium. While low concentrations of H2O2 alone are not sufficient for the inhibition of PTPs, the roles of alendronate and calcium in the inhibition are not clear. Therefore, we set up a series of experiments in HEPES buffer with the external addition of 10 μmH2O2 to look at the function of each component. The combination of calcium and alendronate without H2O2, the combination of alendronate and H2O2 without calcium, or the combination of calcium and H2O2 without alendronate gave no significant inactivation (Fig. 5,closed circles, open triangles, and closed triangles, respectively) relative to the control (open circles). Only in the presence of alendronate, calcium, and H2O2 was a time-dependent inhibition observed (Fig. 5, closed squares), indicating that the combination of these three components is necessary for the inactivation of PTPs. Although the combination of alendronate, calcium, and H2O2is required for the inhibition of PTPs, how these three components combine together, in what form or structure, is not clear. To investigate further the nature of this inhibitory species, the individual equilibrium binding constants (K i) for the inhibition of CD45 were determined. For the determination ofK i (ALN) (where ALN is alendronate), the concentrations of calcium (1 mm CaCl2) and hydrogen peroxide (externally added 4 μmH2O2) were fixed. As shown in Fig.6 a, the observed rate of inactivation was dependent on alendronate concentration. Under these conditions, the Kitz-Wilson method of data analysis (25Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) yielded ak i (ALN) of 0.72 ± 0.02 min−1 and an apparentK i (ALN) of 3.8 ± 0.7 μm. The faster inactivation rate constant obtained here compared with the result obtained in Fig. 2 is due to the higher amount of H2O2 in this experiment. For the determination of K i (Ca2+), the concentrations of alendronate (6 μm) and H2O2 (externally added 4 μmH2O2) were fixed. Fig. 6 b showed that the observed rate of inactivation was dependent on calcium concentration at fixed alendronate and H2O2concentrations. The same kind of data analysis as for alendronate gave a k i (Ca2+) of 0.65 ± 0.05 min−1 and an apparent dissociation constant (K i (Ca2+)) of 3.4 ± 0.7 μm. In this calculation, the free calcium concentration in the system was obtained by titration of calcium with the indicator calcium green 5N as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” The reason for this correction is that 10 μm EDTA in the assay buffer will chelate calcium; in addition, other components in the assay buffer might chelate calcium. For the determination ofK i (H2O2), the concentrations of alendronate (2 μm) and calcium (1 mm CaCl2) were fixed. The observed rate of inactivation was dependent on H2O2concentration as shown in Fig. 6 c. Thek obs3 in Fig. 6 c was obtained by subtracting the background rate of H2O2 alone from the rate in the presence of alendronate, calcium, and H2O2. In this case, ak i (H2O2)of 0.66 ± 0.02 min−1 and an apparent equilibrium binding constant (K i (H2O2)) of 19 ± 1 μm were obtained. The linearity of the three plots shown in Fig. 6 is consistent with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry of a ternary complex of alendronate, metal ion, and H2O2 as the inactivating species (30Stankiewicz P.J. Gresser M.J. Tracey A.S. Hass L.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), although the three components could also be acting synergistically to inactivate the enzyme without forming a ternary complex. The observed inhibition of PTP1B by the combination of alendronate and calcium was found not to be reversible by dilution (data not shown).

Among the events that occur during either “inside-out” or “outside-in” signaling through αIIbβ3 is the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) and the association of pp125FAK with cytoskeletal components. To examine the role of pp125FAK in these integrin-mediated events, pp125FAK phosphorylation and association with the cytoskeleton was determined in cells expressing two mutant forms of αIIbβ3: αIIbβ3(D723A/E726A), a constitutively active integrin in which the putative binding site for pp125FAK is altered, and αIIbβ3(F727A/K729E/F730A), in which the putative binding site for α-actinin is altered. Both mutants were expressed on the cell surface and were able to bind ligand, either spontaneously or upon activation. Whereas cells expressing αIIbβ3(D723A/E726A) were able to form focal adhesions and stress fibers upon adherence to fibrinogen, cells expressing αIIbβ3(F727A/K729E/F730A) adhere to fibrinogen, but had reduced focal adhesions and stress fibers. pp125FAK is recruited to focal adhesions in adherent cells expressing αIIbβ3(D723A/E726A) and is phosphorylated in adherent cells or in cells in suspension in the presence of fibrinogen. In adherent cells expressing αIIbβ3(F727A/K729E/F730A), pp125FAK was phosphorylated despite reduced formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers. We conclude that activation of pp125FAK can be dissociated from two important events in integrin signaling, the assembly of focal adhesions in adherent cells and integrin activation following ligand occupation.

The cytoplasmic domains of integrins constitute an essential link between the extracellular, ligand-binding domain of the receptor and both signaling and structural mechanisms inside the cell. Ranging in length from 15 amino acids for the α1 subunit to over 1000 amino acids for the β4 subunit, the cytoplasmic domains extend inward from the plasma membrane toward various cytosolic components known to be involved in integrin-mediated signaling such as heterotrimeric G proteins, proteins involved in phospholipid metabolism, serine-threonine kinases, tyrosine kinases, calcium transport systems, and cytoskeleton components (1Sims P.J.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although structurally distinct, the different α and β cytoplasmic domains show areas of regional homology, suggesting a conserved tertiary structure. The nine known β subunits contain a highly conserved membrane-proximal polar region with the consensus sequence HDRREFAKFEKEK, which is separated by a stretch of nine amino acids from a central NPXY motif and a stretch of 16–25 amino acids from a distal NPXY motif. The NPXY sequence prescribes a signal for clathrin-coated pit-mediated internalization of integral membrane proteins (8Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is a recognition site for Shc, an SH2-containing adaptor protein (9Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The spacing of the tyrosine residues in the α1, β3, and β6 cytoplasmic tails conforms to the spacing of tyrosine residues in immunoglobulin family tyrosine-based activation motifs, which represent coupling sequences for protein tyrosine kinases and adapter molecules (10Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Like the β subunits, the α subunits also contain a conserved membrane-proximal region with the consensus sequence, KXGFFKR, followed in many cases by a sequence predicting a β turn. The structural diversity of the cytoplasmic domains is increased further by the expression of alternatively spliced forms of several subunits, including β1 (11Altruda F. Cervella P. Tarone G.

Biochem. 1991; 199: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Several important integrin functions have been linked to sequences in the cytoplasmic domains. The recruitment of integrins into focal adhesions is mediated by the cytoplasmic domains. Solowska and co-workers (17Solowska J. Guan J.L. Marcantonio E.E. Trevithick J.E. Buck C.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) provided early evidence that deletion of the β1 subunit cytoplasmic domain blocked integrin association into focal adhesions. Subsequent deletion mapping and random mutagenesis studies have indicated that the sequences required for direction to focal adhesions are localized to several discrete regions in the β cytoplasmic domains, including the dibasic sequence in the membrane-proximal region that is highly conserved in those β cytoplasmic domains that localize to focal adhesions, the NPXY sequences, and the carboxyl terminus (18Marcantonio E.E.

Some of the same general regions required for direction to focal adhesions have been implicated in the interaction of β subunit cytoplasmic domains with α-actinin (24Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) and with talin (25Horwitz A. Duggan K. Buck C. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K.

(1994) The Interaction of Talin with Integrin Cytoplasmic Domains. Thesis, University of North Carolina.Google Scholar), proteins that are components of the cellular cytoskeleton and are present in focal adhesions. Sequences in the α subunit cytoplasmic domains also appear to play a role in normal ligand-dependent localization of integrins to focal adhesions (22Ylänne P. Chen Y. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 28Kassner P.D. Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol.

In addition, integrin cytoplasmic domains play an important role in regulating the affinity of the integrin for ligand. Both α and β subunit cytoplasmic tails appear to be important for affinity modulation. O'Toole et al. (30O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1991; 254: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) found that the affinity of αIIbβ3 for ligand was increased by truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of αIIb. Activation correlated with removal of the highly conserved membrane-proximal GFFKR motif, suggesting that this motif was required to maintain the receptor in a low affinity activation state. Deletion of the membrane-proximal LLITIHD region of the β3 cytoplasmic domain also produced a high affinity receptor (31Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylänne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Further studies have identified Asp-723 in β3 and Arg-995 in αIIb as important and suggested that these two residues form a molecular hinge that regulates receptor affinity (32Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The NPXY motif in the β subunit cytoplasmic domain also appeared to be important in the regulation of the affinity state of αIIbβ3, since point mutations in this region inhibited activation through the α subunit (33O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A naturally occurring mutation in the β cytoplasmic domain at serine 752 in a patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia inhibited activation of αIIbβ3 (34Chen Y.P. O'Toole T.E. Ylänne J. Rosa J.-P. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the association of integrins with focal adhesions has been well established, the factors regulating this association and the mechanisms by which integrins signal cytoskeletal assembly remain uncertain. Focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK), a 125-kDa cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (35Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar), is a component of focal adhesions and is phosphorylated following integrin-mediated adhesion or integrin clustering (36Guan J.L.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK is an early event in adhesion and phosphorylation persists as long as cells remain attached to substrata (41Defilippi P. Bozzo C. Volpe G. Romano G. Venturino M. Silengo L. Tarone G. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Inhibition of pp125FAK phosphorylation by tyrosine kinase inhibitors is associated with reduced formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers (38Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 41Defilippi P. Bozzo C. Volpe G. Romano G. Venturino M. Silengo L. Tarone G. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases results in increased phosphorylation of pp125FAK, which correlated with the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers (42Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3643-3654PubMed Google Scholar, 43Defilippi P. Retta S.F. Olivo C. Palmieri M. Venturino M. Silengo L. Tarone G. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These observations led to a suggestion that tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK might be implicated in cytoskeletal assembly and formation of focal adhesions. The present studies were undertaken to examine further the role of pp125FAK in integrin function. We have used two unique mutants of the β3 cytoplasmic domain to examine the role of pp125FAK in assembly of focal adhesions and in integrin activation. One mutation is in the region of the β3cytoplasmic domain, which has been suggested to interact with α-actinin and interrupts the association of αIIbβ3 with focal adhesions. The second, which is similar to a recent mutation reported by Hughes et al. (32Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), is in the putative pp125FAK binding site in the β3 cytoplasmic domain and results in a constitutively active integrin. To examine the role of pp125FAKphosphorylation in its association with focal adhesions and in integrin activation, we have examined the state of pp125FAKphosphorylation in cells expressing these mutant integrins. The results suggest that pp125FAK phosphorylation is independent of integrin association with focal adhesions and that activation of αIIbβ3 can occur without inducing pp125FAK phosphorylation.

Human thrombin was gift from Dr. Frank Church (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). β 3 and αIIbcDNA were isolated from a cDNA library provided by Lawrence Brass (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The β3 cDNA was mutated to eliminate the EcoRI site at nucleotide 2270 (β3ΔE). The cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI site in Bluescript II KS. The constructs were then subcloned into the HindIII andXbaI sites in the multiple cloning region of pT7T3. A cytoplasmic domain cassette was created in β3ΔE using the molecular cloning strategy diagrammed in Fig. 1 with the oligonucleotides listed in TableI. All restriction sites, which were created or modified, resulted in silent mutations. A uniqueNdeI restriction site (C to A at nucleotide 2247) flanking the 5′ end of the cytoplasmic domain was introduced by PCR mutagenesis during an initial round of amplification using oligonucleotides 1 and 2 (Fig. 1, Step A). An existing BsaBI restriction site at base 2418, 24 bases downstream from the stop codon, was altered by a C to G base change at position 2417, which was introduced during a second round of amplification (Fig. 1, Step B). In this reaction, the initial PCR product from Step A was used as a megaprimer with oligonucleotide 3. The modification of the BsaBI site removed a dam methylation site, thereby making the construct susceptible to digestion with BsaBI when grown in standard host strains. Full-length β3 in pT7T3 was digested withApaI and XbaI. The digestion fragment containing the vector and the 5′ region of β3 up to the firstApaI site at nucleotide 110 was isolated and ligated to the similarly digested PCR product (Fig. 1, Step C). Subsequently, the fragment from ApaI 110 to ApaI 2176 was cloned into the ApaI site in the correct orientation (Fig. 1, Step D). This new construct lacked most of the 3′-untranslated region of β3 cDNA. The region of the construct from base 2176 to 2418, which was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, was sequenced to confirm that there were no mutations. Three additional unique restriction sites, BssHII at base 2306 (A to G at 2304), AatII at base 2357 (C to G at 2355), and BglII, which is located at base 2405 in the 3′-untranslated region, were generated by PCR of the construct in Step D with oligonucleotides 4 and 5 (Fig. 1, Step E). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XbaI and subcloned into the similarly digested β3/pT7T3 construct (Fig. 1, Step F). The construct from Step F was digested with BssHII and AatII, isolated from an agarose gel, and ligated to annealed oligonucleotide pair 6 and 7. This completed the construction of the β3 cDNA with four unique, silent restriction sites in the cytoplasmic domain.Table IOligonucleotides used in the molecular construction of the β3cytoplasmic domain cassette and mutant cDNAs1.5′-AAAGACCTTAAGGACACTGGCAAGGATGC-3′*2.3′-CCGGACGCCGGGACGAGTATACCTTTGAG-5′NdeI*3.3′-CGTCAGTAGGAGTCTACTAATAGCCAATTGGAGATCTCGCGCG-5′BsaBI XbaI* *4.5′-GCCCGGGCATATGATCGTTGCGCGCATCGTTGACGTCTACCTTCACCAAT-3′NdeI BssBI AatII*** * *****5.3′-ATTACTATTCGTCTAGAGGAGTCTACTAATAGTAGATCTCGCGCG-5′BglII BsaBI XbaI6.5′-CGCGCCAGACGAAAatGGGACACAGCCAACAACCCACTGTATAAAGAGGCGACGT-3′7.3′-GGTCTCGTTTTACCCTGTGTCGGTTGTTGGGTGACATATTTCTCCGC-5′BssHII AatII8.5′-TATGGAAACTCCTCATCAC-3′9.3′-ACCTTTGAGGAGTAGTGGTAG-5′NdeI10.5′-CATCCACGACCGAAAAGAATTTGCTAAATTTGAGGAAGAG-3′11.3′- GTGCTGGCTTTTCTTAAACGATTTAAACTCCTTCTCGCGC-5′BssHII* **12.5′-CATCCACGCCCGAAAAGCTTTTGCTAAatTTGAGGAAGAG-3′13.3′- GTGCGGGCTTTTCGAAAACGATTTAAACTCCTTCTCGCGC-5′A A BssHII*** * ***14.5′-CATCCACGACCGAAAAGAAGCAGCTGAAGCAGAGGAAGAG-3′15.3′- GTGCTGGCTTTTCTTCGTCGACTTCGTCTCCTTCTCGCGC-5′A E A BssHIIOligonucleotides 1–5 are PCR primers that were used to introduce unique restriction sites into the cDNA.

The asterisks indicate base changes from the wild-type sequence. Cytoplasmic domain mutations were generated by annealing appropriate oligonucleotide pairs at 85 °C for 5 min and allowing to cool to 22 °C over 1 h. Double-stranded fragments containing the base changes required for the generation of the desired amino acid substitutions were ligated to the appropriately digested construct (Fig. 1, Steps H, I, and J). These completed constructs were sequenced to verify that there were no synthesis errors and that the desired base changes were present. The constructs were digested with AflII and XbaI, and the fragment was isolated and subcloned into similarly digested β3/pcDNAI/Amp. DNA for transfection was purified on a Qiagen-tip 100 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the University of North Carolina Tissue Culture Facility and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM-H) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.). Adherent CHO-K1 cells were detached in 1 × trypsin-EDTA (Boehringer Mannheim), washed, and resuspended in PBS containing 1 μg of linearized αIIb cDNA in pRc/CMV-Neo and 10 μg linearized β3 cDNA constructs in pcDNAI/Amp. The cells were electroporated at 25 microfarads and 0.75 kV for 5 s in a gene pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). After 48 h, cells were cultured in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml active Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and neomycin-resistant cells were selected for 2 weeks. Cells were harvested and immunostained with AP2 as described below, and single positive cells were sorted into individual wells in 96-well plates on an Epics model 753 cell sorter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Adherent cells grown to confluence were rinsed with PBS, incubated on ice with 5 mm NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min, and rinsed with cold 5 mm glycine in Tris-buffered saline. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS and solubilized in 75 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc SC (Boehringer Mannheim), and 10 μg/ml benzamidine for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min, then precleared with normal mouse serum and γ-Bind Plus Sepharose (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were centrifuged and incubated with 10 μg of purified Tab IgG for 1 h followed by γ-Bind Plus Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed five times with buffer containing 0.5 mNaCl, 0.05 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and immunoprecipitates were released from γ-Bind Plus Sepharose in Laemmli buffer (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on a 7.5% acrylamide gel with biotinylated molecular weight markers (Sigma) and separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were developed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and detected with BM chemiluminescence (Boehringer Mannheim). Clonal cell lines expressing wild-type αIIbβ3 or variants were harvested as follows. Briefly, cells grown to confluence in complete medium containing Geneticin were rinsed with PBS and incubated in 3.5 mm EDTA in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were trypsinized with the addition of 0.10 volume 0.1%l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (Sigma) and allowed to incubate for 5 min, before adding 0.50 volume 20% fetal bovine serum containing 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) in PBS. The cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in the buffers indicated below for the respective studies. Cells were harvested as described above and resuspended in PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.1 mm each MgCl2 and CaCl2 (PBC). Cells were incubated with AP2 ascites (1/16,000 dilution) for 30 min on ice, washed twice with cold PBS, and incubated as above with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Cells were washed once and resuspended in 400 μl of PBS for fluorescence analysis on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For PAC1 staining, cells were incubated with purified IgM antibody at 1 μg/ml in Tyrode's solution containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (PBB), for 30 min at room temperature, then stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM. Staining with PAC1 antibody was also performed in the presence of 1 mm GRGDSP. To detect activation of expressed αIIbβ3, cells were preincubated with LIBS6 ascites for 30 min at 37 °C, washed once with cold PBS, and immunostained with PAC1 in the presence or absence of 1 mmGRGDSP. 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with either 2.5 μg/ml fibronectin or 4 μg/ml fibrinogen in PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. Plates were then incubated with PBS containing 2% heat-inactivated BSA for 2 h at 37 °C to block non-specific binding on the plates. Cells harvested as described above were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in PBC and incubated in the presence or absence of 1 mmGRGDSP for 30 min at 22 °C prior to plating 1 × 105 cells/well. Cells were allowed to bind to the plates for 2 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBS to remove non-adherent cells. Adherent cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in PBS containing 20% methanol for 30 min at 22 °C. Excess dye was removed by three washes with water, and cells were solubilized in 1% SDS for 16 h at 22 °C. Cell binding was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm in a Bio Kinetics model EL 340 plate reader (Biotek Instruments). Specific binding was defined as the difference between t"

We used an antibody to rat ER-60 to investigate the possible role of this protease in apolipoprotein B (apoB) degradation. First, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments with the anti-rat ER-60 antibody suggested that HepG2 cells contain a homologue of ER-60 with an approximate molecular mass of 58–60 kDa. The ER-60 homologue was mostly associated with the luminal contents of HepG2 microsomes. Evidence from co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments appear to suggest that the ER-60 homologue in HepG2 cells is associated with apoB intracellularly. A small pool of apoB was recovered when HepG2 lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-rat ER-60 antibody followed by a second immunoprecipitation with anti-apoB antibody. Furthermore, cross-linking of permeabilized cells with dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) further demonstrated association of apoB with the ER-60 homologue in HepG2 cells. Three polypeptides with molecular masses of 78, 66, and 50 kDa were consistently found to be associated with apoB as well as the 58-kDa ER-60 homologue. The 78-kDa protein associated with both apoB and ER-60 appeared to represent immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) based on immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody. Cross-linking and immunoblotting experiments suggested the association of the 78-kDa BiP with both the 58-kDa ER-60 homologue as well as the 550-kDa apoB.In summary, the data suggests that HepG2 cells contain a 58-kDa protein which is homologous to the rat liver ER-60 in size, antigenecity, and intracellular localization. The ER-60 homologue in HepG2 cells appears to be closely associated with apoB, as well as other proteins possibly representing ER chaperones such as BiP. We hypothesize that the ER-60 homologue may be involved in the degradation of apoB in the ER lumen of HepG2 cells.

The identity of the ER-associated protease involved in apoB degradation has remained elusive, however, some characteristic features of this degradative system have recently been documented. The ER-associated protease appears to be responsible for fragmentation of apoB into a number of distinct degradation intermediates including an abundant 70-kDa fragment (12Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sallach S. Adeli K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

Intraluminal degradation of secretion-competent apoB associated with nascent HDL-like and LDL-like lipoprotein particles in the secretory pathway is also ALLN-sensitive and may be mediated by a putative ER-localized protease (17Adeli K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) has recently shown that the luminal degradative process is also DTT sensitive. The ER lumen contains a number of ER-resident proteins including molecular chaperones and proteases. Recently, two ER-associated proteases were purified to homogeneity and characterized (20Urade R. Nasu M. Moriyama T. Wada K. Kito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15152-15159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Urade R. Takenaka Y. Kito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22004-22009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these proteases, the ER-60 protease was first purified from the ER of rat liver, and was shown to be a cysteine protease (20Urade R. Nasu M. Moriyama T. Wada K. Kito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15152-15159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Urade R. Kito M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ER-60 has 98% homology in amino acid sequence to rat phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (20Urade R. Nasu M. Moriyama T. Wada K. Kito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15152-15159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protease has been implicated in degradation of human lysozyme (23Otsu M. Urade R. Kito M. Omura F. Kituchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14958-14961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ER-60 was shown to be chemically cross-linked to misfolded mutant lysozyme. It was also found to degrade the reduced and denatured form of lysozyme, but not the native form in vitro (23Otsu M. Urade R. Kito M. Omura F. Kituchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14958-14961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the present report, we demonstrate that HepG2 cells contain a homologue of rat liver ER-60, an ER-localized cysteine protease. Evidence from co-immunoprecipitation, chemical cross-linking, and a combination of immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments suggest that apoB-100 is associated intracellularly with the ER-60 homologue in HepG2 cells. It is thus postulated that the ER-60 homologue may be involved in a degradative system affecting apoB in the ER. Such a protease may be responsible for the ER luminal protease activity fragmenting apoB into distinct degradation intermediates. HepG2 cells (ATCC HB 8065) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Fetal bovine serum (certified grade) and cell culture media were obtained from Life Technologies (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Monoclonal anti-BiP was obtained from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Rabbit anti-ER-60 polyclonal antibody was developed from purified rat ER-60 (20Urade R. Nasu M. Moriyama T. Wada K. Kito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15152-15159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured HepG2 cells were maintained as described (24Adeli K. Sinkevitch C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 2: 345-348Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Confluent HepG2 cultures were incubated with methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential medium for 120 min, pulse-labeled (15 min to 2 h, see figure legends) with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine + cysteine (Pro-MixTM, NEN Life Science Products), washed 3 times and chased for 10 min, in culture medium supplemented with 10 mm methionine and 2 mm cysteine. The cells were then washed and incubated in CSK buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 0.1m KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium-free EDTA, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8) containing 50 μg/ml digitonin for 10 min at room temperature. Digitonized cells were washed three times in CSK buffer and then incubated in CSK buffer under various conditions as described under figure legends. The cells were solubilizied in a solubilization buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 KIU/ml Trasylol, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 0.5 μm ALLN). Cell extracts were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation. Total microsomes were isolated from intact cells (4 × 60-mm dishes) essentially as described (3Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Thorlin T. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol.

The membrane and luminal fractions were then subjected to immunoprecipitation as described below. To cross-link HepG2 cells, the cells were normally first permeabilized with digitonin as described above. Permeabilized cells were incubated with DSP (1 mm) for 30 min on ice, and the cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mm glycine and incubation for 15 min on ice. Cross-linked cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in solubilization buffer as above, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed using Immunoprecipitin (Life Technologies) as described previously (12Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Macri J. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7328-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In procedures where monoclonal antibodies were employed they were first bound to Affi-Gel beads (Bio-Rad) then incubated with the samples overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged to pellet the beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with wash buffer and were prepared for SDS-PAGE (12Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Macri J.

Immunoblotting was performed by SDS-PAGE analysis of cell lysates of normal or cross-linked cells, followed by electrophoretic transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Bio-Rad Semi-Dry blotter. Gels used for immunoblotting experiments were minigels (8 × 5 cm) and were either 10% resolving (for ER-60) or 4.5% resolving (for apoB). The membranes were washed, blocked with a 5% solution of fat-free dry milk powder, and then incubated with a primary antibody. After washing, the membranes were subsequently incubated with a second antibody conjugated to peroxidase. Detection of peroxidase activity was carried out using an AEC Turbo substrate (Dimension Lab Inc., Mississauga, Canada). SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Gels (16 × 12 cm) used were either 6% resolving, 10% resolving, or gradient gels (3–15%). The gels were fixed, stained, and were fluorographed by incubating in Amplify (Amersham). The gels were dried, and exposed to DuPont autoradiographic film at −80 °C for 1–4 days. The ER-60 protease has been previously detected in rat liver (20Urade R. Nasu M. Moriyama T. Wada K. Kito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15152-15159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first attempted to detect the presence of an ER-60 homologue in HepG2 cells. Two approaches were used. First, intact HepG2 cells were pulsed for 1 h, chased briefly to label intracellular proteins, and then immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against purified rat ER-60. As shown in Fig. 1 A(lanes 3 and 4), we consistently detected a protein with an approximate size of 58 kDa following immunoprecipitation with the anti-rat ER-60 antibody. In contrast, non-immune rabbit serum (lanes 1 and 2) did not immunoprecipitate a similarly sized band from HepG2 cells, suggesting the specificity of the immunoprecipitation with the anti-rat ER-60 antibody. The 58-kDa band immunoprecipitated from HepG2 cells thus resembles rat ER-60 in both size and antigenecity. In a second approach, we solubilized HepG2 cells and separated the total cell extract by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with either non-immune rabbit serum or with rabbit anti-rat ER-60 antibody. Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6, shows the immunoblot of HepG2 cell lysate probed with non-immune rabbit serum. No bands were detectable having a size in the 58-kDa range. However, immunoblotting with the rabbit anti-rat ER-60 antibody (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7 and 8) resulted in the detection of a protein with an approximate molecular size of 58 kDa. Thus, the immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting data both suggest the presence of a protein in HepG2 cells which resembles the rat ER-60 in size and antigenecity. Hence, we refer to this protein as an ER-60 protease homologue. Subcellular fractionation of HepG2 cells was also carried out to investigate the intracellular localization of the ER-60 homologue. Intact HepG2 cells were pulsed for 1 h, chased briefly, and then homogenized to isolate a total microsomal fraction. The microsomes were fractionated further by sodium carbonate extraction to prepare a membrane pellet and a soluble luminal content. The microsomal fractions were then immunoprecipitated with the anti-rat ER-60 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the 58-kDa ER-60 homologue was readily detectable in the lumen of microsomes (lanes 7–9), although some signal was also detectable in the membrane fraction (lane 10). The data suggest that the ER-60 protease homologue in HepG2 cells is present in the microsomal fraction and appears to be predominately luminal in nature with some possible association with the microsomal membrane. Immunoblotting of the same microsomal fractions showed similar results (data not shown), further confirming the observations made by immunoprecipitation. First, the association of apoB with the ER-60 homologue was examined by pulse-chase labeling of HepG2 cells followed by co-immunoprecipitation of apoB and ER-60 homologue. Fig.2 A (lane 1) shows the immunoprecipitation of apoB. Goat anti-human apoB antibody detected the full-length apoB as well as a large number of shortened apoBs which mostly represent nascent apoB chains since the cells were pulsed for a long period of time but chased briefly. Interestingly, the apoB immunoprecipitate included a band migrating at around 58 kDa which may possibly represent the ER-60 homologue co-immunoprecipitating with apoB. A 58-kDa band was consistently detected in the apoB immunoprecipitate in several experiments. The ER-60 antibody immunoprecipitated a 58-kDa protein (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) similar to that observed in Fig. 1 A. We also attempted to co-immunoprecipitate apoB and ER-60. In this approach, labeled HepG2 cells were first immunoprecipitated with the anti-rat ER-60 antibody, the immunoprecipitate was eluted and then subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with monospecific goat anti-human apoB antibody. A small amount of apoB was detected (Fig.2 A, lane 3) in the ER-60 immunoprecipitate. This further suggests that the ER-60 homologue in HepG2 cells is associated with a small pool of apoB. Experiments were also performed to demonstrate the association of apoB with the ER-60 homologue in CHAPS-solubilized HepG2 cells. Solubilization in CHAPS appears to provide a less stringent condition allowing for a better detection of intracellular protein-protein interactions (28Hjelmeland L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6368-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and has been previously employed to study intracellular association of ER chaperones with secretory and membrane proteins. As shown in Fig. 2 B, immunoprecipitation of apoB from CHAPS-solubilized HepG2 cells resulted in the detection of a number of additional proteins, which may represent proteins genuinely associated with apoB or nonspecifically immunoprecipitated. Probing CHAPS-solubilized HepG2 cells with the anti-rat ER-60 antibody again detected a 58-kDa protein, however, other bands were also detected in the ER-60 immunoprecipitate including a protein migrating at 550 kDa. Thus, the data from CHAPS-solubilized HepG2 cells appears to support the notion that apoB and the ER-60 homologue may be intracellularly associated. To confirm the observations in Fig. 2, A and B, we performed experiments in which 35S-labeled HepG2 lysates were first immunoprecipitated with either non-immune rabbit serum or non-immune goat serum. The immunoprecipitates were then dissociated and re-immunoprecipitated with either rabbit anti-rat ER-60 antibody or with goat anti-human apoB, respectively. As shown in Fig.2 C, no detectable bands were observed in either co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that the small amount of apoB detected in Fig. 2 A, lane C, is not due to nonspecific co-immunoprecipitation. Further confirmation for the specific association of the ER-60 protease homologue and apoB came from the experiment in Fig. 2 D. In this experiment, HepG2 lysates were first immunoprecipitated with either non-immune rabbit serum or with rabbit anti-rat ER-60 antibody. Both immunoprecipitates were dissociated and re-immunoprecipitated with goat anti-human apoB antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with goat anti-human apoB antibody. As shown in Fig.2 D, no detectable band was observed when the HepG2 lysates were first immunoprecipitated with non-immune rabbit serum (lane 1). However, immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-rat ER-60 antibody (lane 2) clearly resulted in the detection of a 550-kDa protein when immunoblotted with goat anti-human apoB antibody. These observations thus elaborate our earlier observations suggesting the intracellular association of apoB and ER-60 protease homologue in HepG2 cells. We also attempted to cross-link apoB and the ER-60 protease homologue using a commonly used chemical cross-linking agent, DSP. Preliminary experiments with DSP showed that prior permeabilization of HepG2 cells increased the efficiency of DSP-mediated cross-linking of proteins and enhanced the sensitivity of detection of apoB cross-linking to ER-60. We thus performed all our subsequent cross-linking experiments in permeabilized cells. Intact HepG2 cells were pulsed, briefly chased, and then permeabilized with digitonin. Permeabilized cells were then cross-linked with DSP, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against apoB and ER-60. The immunoprecipitates were treated with a high concentration of DTT to dissociate cross-linked proteins before analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Fig. 3 A shows the apoB immunoprecipitates from control and DSP-cross-linked permeabilized HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A (lane 1) goat anti-human apoB antibody consistently recovered from non-cross-linked cells both the full-length apoB, as well as a number of nascent chains. Cross-linking of HepG2 cells resulted in the recovery of apoB, its nascent chains, as well as a few other proteins (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). Two bands with approximate sizes of 58 and 78 kDa became more visible in the apoB immunoprecipitates when cells were cross-linked with DSP (observed in several independent experiments). When probed with the anti-rat ER-60 antibody (Fig. 3 A, lane 3), a single 58-kDa protein band was detected in control cells (as expected). A strong band was also visible with an approximate size of 300–400 kDa. This band has been previously observed when immunoprecipitation is performed with Immunoprecipitin. It is detected in some immunoprecipitation experiments (when a preclearing step with Immunoprecipitin is not performed) and is the result of nonspecific binding of the unknown protein with the Immunoprecipitin (the protein can be recovered by incubating the HepG2 lysate with Immunoprecipitin without any added antibody) (data not shown). Four bands were recovered from cross-linked cells when immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-rat ER-60 antibody (50, 58, 66, and 78 kDa) (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Among these four bands, the 58-kDa band appeared to represent the ER-60 homologue itself. The ER-60 homologue was consistently found to cross-link to the protein species at 50, 66, and 78 kDa in several experiments, two of which are shown in Fig. 3 B. In some immunoprecipitates, a small amount of the 550-kDa apoB was also detected after cross-linking of permeabilized HepG2 cells and immunoprecipitation with the anti-ER-60 antibody. However, long exposures of the fluorograph were needed to visualize the apoB bands, suggesting the cross-linking of only a very small amount of apoB with ER-60 homologue. To further confirm the association of apoB and ER-60, permeabilized and cross-linked HepG2 cells were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with the goat anti-human apoB antibody. The apoB immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the gel was further immunoblotted with the anti-rat ER-60 antibody (Fig. 3 C). As shown in Fig.3 C, a 58-kDa protein was clearly detectable in the apoB immunoprecipitate from cross-linked HepG2 cells. We also detected the ER-60 protease homologue in the apoB immunoprecipitates from control cells (Fig. 3 C, lane 1) upon immunoblotting, but cross-linking with DSP consistently resulted in an increase in the abundance of the 58-kDa ER-60 protease homologue (Fig. 3 C, lane 2). Finally, to examine the possibility of nonspecific immunoprecipitation in the experiments above, we performed an experiment in which control cells and cells cross-linked with DSP were immunoprecipitated with non-immune goat serum (Fig. 3 D). The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-rat ER-60 antibody. No bands were detected on the blot, suggesting that the detection of a 58-kDa protein in Fig. 3 C was not due to nonspecific immunoprecipitation. As described above, immunoprecipitation of apoB and ER-60 from DSP-cross-linked HepG2 cells consistently resulted in the detection of a 78-kDa protein. Considering the size homology of this protein species with the molecular chaperone, BiP, we examined whether this protein is indeed BiP by immunoprecipitating cross-linked HepG2 cells with a monoclonal antibody against BiP. Non-immune mouse serum did not detect the 78-kDa protein (Fig.4 A, lane 1). The mouse anti-BiP antibody detected a 78-kDa protein as expected, as well as a number of other proteins (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). The cross-linking of BiP with several intracellular proteins is clearly expected considering the role of BiP in the folding of many secretory proteins. Interestingly, among the proteins cross-linked to BiP was a band at 550-kDa protein comparable in size to apoB (Fig. 4 D, lane 2). A 58-kDa protein resembling ER-60 in size was also detectable in the BiP immunoprecipitate. To further investigate intracellular association with BiP, HepG2 cells were cross-linked and then immunoprecipitated with non-immune mouse serum bound to Affi-Gel beads (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) or mouse anti-BiP antibody bound to Affi-Gel beads (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed on two gels (a 10% gel for blotting with ER-60 antibody and a 4.5% gel for blotting with apoB antibody). The gels were then immunoblotted with either rabbit anti-rat ER-60 antibody or goat anti-human apoB antibody. Immunoblotting with anti-ER-60 antibody detected a 58-kDa protein in the BiP immunoprecipitate but not in the immunoprecipitate from non-immune serum. Similarly, immunoblotting with anti-human apoB antibody detected a 550-kDa protein in the BiP immunoprecipitate but not in the immunoprecipitate from non-immune serum. The data thus confirms the association of both the ER-60 protease homologue as well as apoB with the 78-kDa BiP protein. In another experiment (Fig. 4 C), control and DSP-cross-linked HepG2 cells were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-rat ER-60 antibody (lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Again, a single 58-kDa band was detected in control cells whereas a 58-kDa band as well as three other proteins with molecular sizes of 78, 66, and 50 kDa were observed in the immunoprecipitate from cross-linked cells. To examine the identity of the 78-kDa protein, DSP-cross-linked cells were first immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-rat ER-60 antibody and the immunoprecipitate was dissociated in a high DTT buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sample was then re-immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-BiP antibody bound to Affi-Gel. As shown in Fig. 4 C, lane 3, the 78-kDa band was recovered following the second immunoprecipitation with the BiP antibody. Interestingly, a second band around 50 kDa was also recovered in this experiment. Since the BiP antibody is raised against a KDEL sequence and has been reported to recover a 50-kDa protein previously (StressGen Technical Bulletin), it is possible that the 50-kDa protein may also represent a KDEL-bearing protein. Overall the cross-linking of a 78-kDa protein with both apoB and the 58-kDa ER-60 suggest intracellular association of BiP with both apoB and ER-60 protease homologue. Recent evidence from our laboratory suggest that apoB may be degraded both when associated with the ER membrane as well as when assembled into secretion competent lipoprotein particles (17Adeli K. Wettesten M. Asp L. Mohammadi A. Macri J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5031-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The kinetics of degradation of membrane-bound apoB and lipoprotein-associated apoB appeared to differ, with the membrane-bound apoB being degraded very rapidly (17Adeli K. Wettesten M. Asp L. Mohammadi A. Macri J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5031-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These findings raised the possibility that more than one proteolytic system may be involved in the degradation of different apoB pools. The degradation of lipoprotein-associated apoB in the lumen of the ER suggested that ER-resident proteases may be involved in this degradation. In the present report, we present evidence for association of apoB with an ER protease, ER-60. The evidence from co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking experiments were consistent in showing an intracellular association of apoB with an ER-60 protease homologue found in HepG2 cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the presence of an ER-60-like protease homologue in HepG2 cells. It is also interesting that this protease is intracellularly associated with apoB, raising the possibility of its involvement in the apoB degradation process. Cross-linking experiments in permeabilized HepG2 cells showed that the ER-60 protease homologue is intracellularly associated with other proteins with molecular masses of 50, 66, and 78 kDa. The 78-kDa protein which consistently cross-linked to ER-60 appeared to represent BiP. In addition, immunoprecipitation of BiP from CHAPS-solubilized HepG2 cells as well as cross-linking experiments showed that BiP may also be associated with apoB. These findings raise the intriguing possibility of a three way association between apoB, ER-60, and BiP in the ER lumen. Whether association of ER-60 and apoB with BiP is an indication of a regulatory process for targeting of apoB for degradation remains to be demonstrated and requires further investigation. It would not be surprising if apoB associates with BiP in the lumen of the ER since the folding and biogenesis of the extremely large apoB polypeptide would be expected to involve the action of intraluminal molecular chaperones. ApoB is already known to associate with microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, protein disulfide isomerase, and possibly calnexin (29Ginsberg H.N. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30Patel S.B. Grundy S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) during its biogenesis in the ER. Patel and Grundy (30Patel S.B. Grundy S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) also showed association of apoB41 with KDEL-bearing proteins including a 78-kDa protein resembling BiP in COS cells. The fraction of newly-synthesized apoB associated with the ER-60 homologue appears to be quantitatively very low. In several experiments performed it appears that only a small fraction of newly-synthesized apoB pool could be recovered in association with the 58-kDa ER-60 homologue. This finding is not surprising and should be expected since it is unlikely that a large portion of the apoB pool would be associated with the ER-60 homologue at any given time. In addition, a major fraction of the newly-synthesized apoB pool is normally found on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane and is unlikely to associate with the ER-60 homologue which appears to be luminal in nature. Presumably only the apoB pool that is fully-translocated and is present in the ER lumen would be targeted by a luminal protease such as the ER-60 protease homologue. Although we do not have direct evidence implicating the ER-60 protease homologue in apoB degradation, we hypothesize that the ER-60 protease is involved in intraluminal degradation of apoB in the ER, based on the evidence showing apoB-ER-60 association and the cysteine protease activity of ER-60 (20Urade R.

Ginsberg and co-workers (18Wu X. Sakata N. Lele K.M. Zhou M. Jiang H. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that even after apoB is translocated into the ER lumen, it can potentially be degraded by a luminal DTT-sensitive degradative system that may be responsible for degrading the N-terminal 70-kDa apoB fragment. We have previously reported that degradation of apoB in permeabilized HepG2 cells can generate specific apoB fragments in the ER including an abundant 70-kDa intermediate (12Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sallach S. Adeli K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Adeli K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7328-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recent experiments in our laboratory support the hypothesis that apoB degradation may occur in two steps. 3K. Adeli, D. Cavallo, A. Mohammadi, and J. Macri, submitted for publication. Our data in the present report demonstrating the association of apoB with an ER-resident protease, ER-60, supports the above notion that proteases other than the proteasome may be involved in the apoB degradation process. It is thus reasonable to hypothesize that the ER-60 protease homologue detected in HepG2 cells may be involved in a luminal proteolytic system that degrades fully-translocated apoB. The luminal process appears to be distinct from the proteasome-mediated degradative process (19Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) operating on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, which degrades the bulk of apoB co-translationally. Efforts are underway to further characterize the ER-associated degradation pathway and confirm its subcellular localization and the involvement of the ER-60 protease in this pathway. It would also be interesting to investigate the role of the ER-associated protease in degradation of nascent apoB-containing lipoprotein particles in the lumen of the ER, and the possible association of the ER-60 protease homologue with these lipoprotein particles."

Fibulin-1 has been shown to self-associate as well as to bind calcium, fibronectin (FN), laminin, nidogen, and fibrinogen. To map ligand-binding sites within fibulin-1, polypeptides corresponding to various regions of fibulin-1 were expressed recombinantly and evaluated for their capacity to bind calcium, FN, or fibulin-1. A calcium-binding site(s) was mapped to EGF-like modules 5–9. A fibulin-1 self-association site was localized to EGF-like modules 5 and 6 (amino acid residues 356–440), as was a binding site for FN. The self-association interaction mediated by this pair of modules involved calcium since divalent cation chelators reduced the binding affinity of the interaction. By contrast, FN binding to EGF-like modules 5 and 6 was unaffected by the presence of divalent cation chelators. It can be concluded that EGF-like modules 5 and 6 bind calcium and mediate homotypic interaction between EGF-like modules 5 and 6 present in different fibulin-1 molecules and heterotypic interaction between EGF-like modules 5 and 6 and type III repeats 13 and 14 in FN. While additional binding sites for calcium or FN were not detected, another fibulin-1 self-association site was found within amino acid residues 30–173. However, unlike the self-association site in EGF-like modules 5 and 6, which was functional in the native protein, the amino-terminal site was cryptic and revealed only after the protein was denatured.

It has been determined that fibulin-1 binds to FN within type III repeats 13 and 14 (6Balbona K. Tran H. Godyna S. Ingham K.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20120-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to a site within the amino-terminal G1-G2 domains of nidogen (7Pan T.C. Kluge M. Zhang R.Z. Mayer U. Timpl R. Chu M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), to a site contained within the carboxyl terminus of the α chain of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor laminin (α1β1γ1) (7Pan T.C.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 329-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and to a site within the carboxyl-terminal region of the fibrinogen Bβ chain (8Tran H. Tanaka A. Litvinovich S.V. Medved L.V.

However, localization of the binding sites within fibulin-1 for these ligands has not been determined. Similarly, the binding site(s) for calcium has not been localized within fibulin-1, although four of its nine EGF-like modules contain the consensus sequence for post-translational hydroxylation of asparagine, and such hydroxylation has been associated with calcium-binding EGF-like modules in a number of proteins (14Stenflo J. Ohlin A.-K. Owen W.G. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sugo T. Bjork I. Holmgren A. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5705-5710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to determine the location of ligand-binding sites within fibulin-1, we have expressed various portions of fibulin-1 in stably transfected eucaryotic cells, purified the expressed proteins, and used them in solid-phase binding assays to evaluate their capacity to bind calcium, fibulin-1, and FN. The mouse monoclonal fibulin-1 antibodies 3A11 and 5D12 and the rabbit polyclonal fibulin-1 antiserum 1323 have been described previously (1Argraves W.S. Tran H. Burgess W.H. Dickerson K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3155-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 4Argraves W.S. Dickerson K. Burgess W.H. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1989; 58: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The epitope for the 3A11 antibody maps to the amino-terminal region of fibulin-1 within residues 30–153, whereas the epitope for the 5D12 antibody maps to the carboxyl-terminal region of fibulin-1C within residues 567–683 (data not shown). The 3A11 and 5D12 IgGs were purified by protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) chromatography. Mouse monoclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antibody (FL-D6) was purchased from Sigma. Fibulin-1 was isolated from human placenta by immunoaffinity chromatography using 3A11 IgG-Sepharose as described previously (1Argraves W.S. Tran H. Burgess W.H. Dickerson K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3155-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Human FN was purified as described by Miekka et al. (16Miekka S.I. Ingham K.C. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The 30-kDa heparin-binding fragment of FN (30-kDa FN) that contains type III modules 12–14, also known as the HEP-2 fragment, was provided by Dr. Kenneth Ingham (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). Ovalbumin was purchased from Sigma. Fibulin-1 (50 μg) was radioiodinated using 20 μg of IODO-GEN (Pierce), 0.5 mCi of Na125I (Amersham Corp.), and 0.25 mm NaI in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Radiolabeled fibulin-1 was separated from the unincorporated iodine by gel filtration chromatography using a Sephadex G-25M column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The specific activity achieved ranged from 1 to 10 μCi/μg of protein. Proteins (e.g. placental fibulin-1, recombinant fibulin-1 polypeptide Fib5–9C, and 30-kDa FN) were fluorescein-labeled using a method described by Busby and Ingham (42Busby T.F. Ingham K.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6127-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, each protein was mixed with a 40-fold molar excess of FITC (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.5. After a 4-h incubation in the dark at room temperature, FITC-labeled protein was separated from unincorporated FITC by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25M column. The degree of labeling was determined optically as described by Ingham and Brew (17Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 670: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A typical labeling efficiency was 4–5 mol of FITC/mol for fibulin-1, 30-kDa FN, and FN and 0.75 for Fib5–9C. Plasmid constructs were designed to express full-length fibulin-1C and six permeations of fibulin-1 that are depicted in Fig.1. The eucaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was used to place the fibulin-1 cDNAs under the transcriptional control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter. The design of the full-length fibulin-1C expression construct designated pcDNAINeoFibC and its transfection into human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (ATCC CCL-121) have been described previously (3Tran H. Mattei M. Godyna S. Argraves W.S. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The constructs FibE1–9C, FibE5–9C, and FibE7–9C were generated by ligating a PCR fragment encoding the fibulin-1 signal sequence (PCR fragment 1) (Table I) to PCR fragments 2, 3, and 4, respectively, and subcloning each into pcDNA3. The construct designated FibA1–3C was made by ligating PCR fragments 5 and 6 and subcloning into pcDNA3. FibA1–3E1–4 was made by subcloning a single PCR fragment (fragment 7) into pcDNA3. FibA1–3E1–8 was made using site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) of two PCR fragments (fragments 8 and 9) to convert Asp525 to a stop codon. All of the PCR fragments described were made using the pairs of primers indicated in Tables I andII and pcDNAINeoFibC (3Tran H. Mattei M. Godyna S. Argraves W.S.

Fibulin-1 plasmid constructs were individually introduced into a non-fibulin-1-expressing cell line, human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, using calcium phosphate transfection with reagents supplied in a kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown in complete medium (minimal essential medium/Earle's balanced sodium salt (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.)) containing 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Colonies of resistant cells were isolated after 4–6 weeks using a sterile cotton swab. For immunological evaluation, the cells were grown in serum-free medium. Aliquots of the conditioned culture medium were screened by immunoblot analysis using fibulin-1 antibody 1323. Those cell lines that were found to express relatively high levels of each of the recombinant forms of fibulin-1 were selected for large-scale protein purification. Stably transfected cell lines were grown to confluence in 2-liter roller bottles (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) in complete medium containing 0.3 mg/ml Geneticin. The medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were grown for 2 days. The medium was collected and clarified by centrifugation at 5000 × g. The supernatant was supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration of 1 mm) and EDTA (final concentration of 5 mm) and preabsorbed on a column of Sepharose CL-4B. The flow-through fraction was applied to one of two types of anti-fibulin-1 IgG-Sepharose affinity columns. 5D12 IgG-Sepharose was used to purify those fibulin-1 polypeptides that contained the carboxyl-terminal fibulin-type module (e.g. FibE1–9C, FibE5–9C, and FibE7–9C fragments), whereas 3A11 IgG-Sepharose was used to purify those fibulin-1 polypeptides that contained the amino-terminal repeated anaphylatoxin domain. Bound protein was eluted with 4 mKSCN. After dialysis against Tris-buffered saline, the fibulin-1 polypeptide preparations were absorbed on heparin-Sepharose and gelatin-Sepharose to remove any contaminating FN, as described previously (19Godyna S. Mann D.M. Argraves W.S. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 467-477Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recombinant fibulin-1 polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes after SDS-PAGE. The membranes were treated with 3% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline and 5 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with 125I-labeled fibulin-1 (20 nm) in the same buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20. Following incubation, the filters were washed with Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 and used to expose Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed as described previously (6Balbona K. Tran H. Godyna S. Ingham K.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20120-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homologous and heterologous ligand displacement assays were carried out in a manner similar to that described before (20Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, FITC-labeled proteins were used instead of radiolabeled proteins, and binding was measured by ELISA using monoclonal FITC antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) and the substratep-nitrophenyl phosphate (disodium; Sigma). The relative efficiency of recombinant fibulin-1 derivatives to bind microtiter plastic was evaluated by ELISA, and based on the results, subsequent coating concentrations were adjusted to achieve equimolar coatings for each protein. Evaluation of the ability of recombinant fibulin-1 subfragments to bind calcium was carried out using the method of Maruyama et al. (21Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Recombinant fibulin-1 fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were washed with 60 mm KCl and 10 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with45Ca2+ (1 μCi/ml) in the same buffer. Unbound45Ca2+ was removed by washing the membrane twice (for 5 min each) with 50% ethanol. The membranes were dried and used to expose Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C. Analysis for the presence of hydroxyasparagine and/or hydroxyaspartate in fibulin-1 was carried out as described by Przysiecki et al. (22Przysiecki C.T. Staggers J.E. Ramjit H.G. Musson D.G. Stern A.M. Bennett C.D. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of fibulin-1 or bovine protein S (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc., South Bend, IN) were dried and resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (2 μg/μl final concentration). Pronase (Calbiochem) was added to a final concentration of 0.16 μg/μl and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C. An additional aliquot of Pronase was added to make the concentration 0.28 μg/μl and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. Following the Pronase digestion, aminopeptidase M (Calbiochem) was added to a concentration of 0.01 μg/μl and incubated for 10 h at 37 °C. The sample was adjusted to pH 2.0 with 98% formic acid and subjected to cation-exchange HPLC analysis. Chromatography was carried out using a 10 × 0.46 cm (inner diameter) column packed with SS/D-X8.25 resin (Sierra Separations, Reno, NV) and a 3 × 0.32-cm guard column of Aminex A-9 (Bio-Rad). Elution buffers and post-column derivatization conditions were as described by Przysieckiet al. (22Przysiecki C.T. Staggers J.E. Ramjit H.G. Musson D.G. Stern A.M. Bennett C.D. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A series of plasmid constructs were generated so as to permit expression in eucaryotic cells of six permeations of human fibulin-1. Fibulin-1 polypeptides were expressed that contained, either alone or in combination, each of the major structural elements found in fibulin-1, including the amino-terminal anaphylatoxin-like region (designated A), the EGF-like region (designated E), and the carboxyl-terminal fibulin-type module (designated C). The portion of the fibulin-1 protein that each construct encoded is schematically depicted in Fig. 1. Each plasmid was stably transfected into HT1080 cells, and the cDNA insert-encoded protein was isolated by anti-fibulin-1-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Shown in Fig. 2 is the SDS-PAGE analysis of the resulting preparations of recombinant fibulin-1 polypeptides. The typical yields ranged from 0.48 to 1.8 mg of protein/liter of conditioned culture medium. The results indicate that chemical amounts of fibulin-1 polypeptides corresponding to various regions of fibulin-1 could be derived from cell lines stably transfected with the fibulin-1 expression constructs. Previous studies have shown that fibulin-1 is a calcium-binding protein (4Argraves W.S. Dickerson K. Burgess W.H. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1989; 58: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 5Kluge M. Mann K. Dziadek M. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To localize the region(s) of fibulin-1 involved in calcium binding, purified recombinant fibulin-1 fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with45Ca2+. As shown in Fig.3, fibulin-1 polypeptides that contained EGF-like domains 5–9 (FibE1–9C, FibE5–9C, FibE7–9C, and FibA1–3E1–8) bound radioactive calcium. Fibulin-1 polypeptides that lacked these EGF-like domains such as FibA1–3E1–4 and FibA1–3C showed no ability to bind calcium in this assay. These data indicate that the calcium-binding site(s) are contained within EGF-like modules 5–9. Of the nine EGF-like modules present in fibulin-1, four (EGF-like modules 5–8) bear a consensus sequence for asparagine β-hydroxylation. Such hydroxylation has been associated with calcium-binding EGF-like modules in several proteins (14Stenflo J. Ohlin A.-K. Owen W.G. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sugo T. Bjork I. Holmgren A. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5705-5710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether fibulin-1 contains β-hydroxyasparagine, cation-exchange HPLC analysis of proteolytic digests of fibulin-1 was performed. As shown in Fig. 4, the HPLC profile of proteolyzed fibulin-1 contains a peak corresponding to that of the erythro-β-hydroxyasparagine standard (Fig. 4,traces C and A, respectively). Analysis of bovine protein S, which is known to contain hydroxylated asparagine (23Stenflo J. Lundwall A. Dahlback B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), produced a similar peak in its HPLC profile (Fig. 4, trace B). Because data from the enzymatic digestion of fibulin-1 could not be used to make quantitative estimates of the amount of β-hydroxyasparagine in fibulin-1, HPLC analysis of acid-hydrolyzed fibulin-1 was performed. The results of this analysis (data not shown) indicated that fibulin-1 contains 3 mol of β-hydroxyaspartate/mol of protein. Since the acid hydrolysis converts asparagine to aspartic acid and each of the consensus β-hydroxylation sites present in EGF-like modules 5–8 contains asparagine, the results can be interpreted to indicate that there are 3 mol of β-hydroxyasparagine in fibulin-1. To localize the regions of fibulin-1 that mediate its self-association, the various recombinantly derived fibulin-1 polypeptides were coated on microtiter wells and tested for their ability to promote binding of solution-phase FITC-labeled fibulin-1. As shown in Fig. 5 A, fibulin-1 polypeptides containing EGF-like modules 1–9, 1–8, and 5–9 (e.g. FibE1–9C, FibE5–9C, and FibA1–3E1–8) promoted binding of FITC-labeled fibulin-1. Fibulin-1 polypeptides that lacked EGF-like modules 5 and 6 (e.g. FibA1–3C, FibA1–3E1–4, and FibE7–9C) showed little or no ability to bind FITC-labeled fibulin-1. Similar binding results were obtained when radioiodinated or digoxygenin-labeled fibulin-1 was used as a probe (data not shown). In addition, when a recombinant fibulin-1 polypeptide that contained EGF-like modules 5–9 (FibE5–9C) was FITC-labeled and used as a probe in the binding assays, it was found to bind to those polypeptides that contained EGF-like modules 5 and 6, but not to the polypeptides that lacked the two modules (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, the binding data indicate that a fibulin-1 self-association site is contained within EGF-like modules 5 and 6. Considering the above-mentioned finding that EGF-like modules 5–8 also bind calcium, we evaluated the effect of divalent cation chelators (EDTA and EGTA) on the fibulin-1/fibulin-1 interaction. As shown in Fig. 5 C, when the binding reactions were done in the presence of EDTA, there was a marked decrease in the binding of FITC-labeled fibulin-1 to fibulin-1 polypeptides bearing EGF-like modules 5–8. A similar magnitude of reduction in binding was obtained when EGTA was used instead of EDTA (data not shown). While the apparent affinity of fibulin-1 binding to polypeptides bearing EGF-like modules 5–8 was significantly reduced by either EDTA or EGTA, complete inhibition of binding was not achieved. The results suggest that calcium bound to EGF-like modules 5–8 plays"

The GK transgene, an 83-kilobase pair mouse genomic DNA fragment containing both promoter regions, was expressed and regulated in a cell-specific manner, and rescued GK null lethality when crossed into mice bearing a targeted mutation of the endogenous GK gene. Livers from the transgenic mice had elevated GK mRNA, protein, and activity levels, compared with controls, and the transgene was regulated in liver by dietary manipulations. The amount of GK immunoreactivity in hepatocyte nuclei, where GK binds to the GK regulatory protein, was also increased.

GK gene expression is cell type-specific and involves two alternate promoters that are differentially regulated (8Iynedjian P.B. Pilot P.R. Nouspikel T. Milburn J.L. Quaade C. Hughes S. Ucla C.

Expression of the islet GK isoform, which is determined by the upstream promoter, is a key determinant of the insulin secretory response to glucose (11Matschinsky F.M.

Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2092-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The upstream promoter is also expressed in several other rare neural/neuroendocrine cell types in the brain and gut, including pituitary corticotropes, although the functional significance of GK in these locations remains to be determined (13Jetton T.

The downstream GK promoter determines expression of the hepatic GK isoform, which is thought to be a rate-determining step for hepatic glucose utilization (11Matschinsky F.M.

Studies of the cis-regulatory elements involved in cell-specific expression of islet GK have shown that a 294-bp DNA fragment containing the upstream promoter is sufficient for reporter gene expression in a variety of neural/neuroendocrine cell types, including pancreatic β cells (13Jetton T.

Elements in the proximal promoter region have been identified that contribute to transcription in both insulinoma cells (16Shelton K.D. Franklin A.J. Khoor A. Beechem J. Magnuson M.A. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). GK gene transcription in the islet appears to be largely constitutive, although glucose acts at a post-transcriptional level to regulate islet GK activity. Increased glucose leads to a 3–4-fold elevation in GK activity, islet glucose usage, and insulin secretion, without a parallel increase in islet GK mRNA (19Chen C. Hosokawa H. Bumbalo L.M. Leahy J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1616-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Liang Y. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol.

The regulation of the downstream GK promoter, which is expressed only in hepatocytes, is both more complex and less well understood than that of the upstream promoter. Insulin increases hepatic GK gene transcription, whereas glucagon, acting via cAMP, decreases transcription (8Iynedjian P.B. Pilot P.R. Nouspikel T. Milburn J.L. Quaade C. Hughes S. Ucla C.

Chem. 1991; 266: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Narkewicz M.R. Iynedjian P.B. Ferre P. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cis-regulatory elements that determine hepatocyte-specific expression and regulation of the hepatic GK isoform are largely undefined as a DNA fragment able to confer both hepatocyte-specific and hormone-regulated expression to a reporter gene has not yet been identified. While Iynedjian et al. (27Iynedjian P.B. Marie S. Wang H. Gjinovci A. Nazaryan K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29113-29120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have recently reported that a 1-kb fragment of the rat downstream promoter is transciptionally active in primary hepatocytes, it is not regulated by insulin. Furthermore, in transgenic mice a 7.5-kb fragment of the rat downstream promoter DNA does not confer position-independent expression on a reporter gene (28Postic C. Niswender K.D. Decaux J.-F. Parsa R. Shelton K.D. Gouhot B. Pettepher C.C. Granner D.K. Girard J. Magnuson M.A. Genomics. 1995; 29: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the cloning and partial sequencing of an 83-kb DNA fragment of the mouse GK gene locus (28Postic C. Niswender K.D. Decaux J.-F. Parsa R. Shelton K.D. Gouhot B. Pettepher C.C. Granner D.K. Girard J. Magnuson M.A. Genomics. 1995; 29: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that the two promoters in the mouse GK gene are separated by 35 kb, and that the gene contains at least eight liver-specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites that span over 20 kb of DNA (28Postic C. Niswender K.D. Decaux J.-F. Parsa R. Shelton K.D. Gouhot B. Pettepher C.C. Granner D.K. Girard J. Magnuson M.A. Genomics. 1995; 29: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Given the complexity of the GK gene locus, both in terms of the widely separated promoter regions, and the multiple, widely dispersed hypersensitive sites, we sought to place an upper limit on its size by inserting the 83-kb fragment of cloned genomic DNA into the genome of mice. The studies presented here indicate that this DNA fragment, which spans from −55 to +28 kilobase pairs relative to the liver transcription start site, is expressed and regulated both in the liver and in the islet, strongly suggesting that it contains the entire mouse GK gene locus. In addition to placing an upper limit on the size of the GK gene locus, these studies have generated a novel animal model for determining the metabolic ramifications of increased GK gene copy number, as are described separately (1Niswender K.D. Shiota M. Postic C. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22604-22609Google Scholar). The insert from P1–305, which contains all GK coding sequences and both promoter regions (28Postic C. Niswender K.D. Decaux J.-F. Parsa R. Shelton K.D. Gouhot B. Pettepher C.C. Granner D.K. Girard J. Magnuson M.A. Genomics. 1995; 29: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was isolated using a Qiagen Maxi plasmid purification kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Restriction of P1–305 DNA with NruI left 392 bp of vector sequence on the 5′ end and 202 bp of vector sequence on the 3′ end of the insert, thereby enabling the transgene to be distinguished from the endogenous mouse GK gene locus. The 83-kb genomic DNA fragment was isolated as a single fragment by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and agarase digestion (Gelase, Epicentre, Madison, WI) of a slice of gel. The DNA solution was dialyzed against TE, concentrated with a microconcentrator tube (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and quantitated by Hoechst dye fluorescence. Mouse zygotes produced by mating two (C57BL/6J × DBA/2J) F1 hybrid mice were microinjected with the P1–305 DNA fragment (∼3 ng/μl) then transferred into pseudopregnant ICR females (29Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994: 217-251Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were identified by PCR and Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA prepared from tail biopsies (29Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994: 217-251Google Scholar). PCR analysis was performed using primers that detected either a 355-bp fragment from the 5′ end vector sequence (5′-AGACGTAGCCCAGCGCGTCGGC and 5′-GCGGCCGCAAATTTATTAGAGC) or a 170-bp fragment from the 3′ end vector sequence (5′-CGACGGCCAATTAGGCCTAC and 5′-GGCTTGAGTCGCTCCTCCTG). Southern blot analysis was performed using standard procedures (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with the 5′ end-specific PCR fragment used to routinely identify transgenic animals. For copy number analysis, probe 1, which lies near the 5′ end of the transgene, was a 2.3-kbSacI fragment from plasmid mGK28.H2.S1. Probe 2, which is located near the middle of the transgene, was a 1.3-kbSacI-BamHI fragment from plasmid mGK40.SB. Probe 3 was a 500-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragment from pmGK18.BS, which contains sequences near the 3′ end of the transgene. Mice bearing the targeted mutation of the endogenous GK gene (7Bali D. Svetlanov A. Lee H.-W. Fusco-DeMane D. Leiser M. Li B. Barzilai N. Surana M. Hou H. Fleischer N. DePinho R. Rossetti L. Efrat S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21464-21467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were identified using a 268-bp PCR fragment amplified from pmGK28.H2 using the primer pair 5′-AGCTTTGGCAAATAGACAT and 5′-TGATGTAACTCATAAGGT. The DNA was cut with BglII and analyzed by Southern blot analysis. A 2.5-kb band was specific for the inactivated GK allele, and a 9-kb band indicated a wild type GK allele, as described previously by Bali et al. (7Bali D. Svetlanov A. Lee H.-W. Fusco-DeMane D. Leiser M. Li B. Barzilai N. Surana M. Hou H. Fleischer N. DePinho R. Rossetti L. Efrat S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21464-21467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). An ∼1-kb DNA fragment (generated by PCR using the primers 5′-CGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCC and 5′-GAACAAGCTAGACACAGGTAG) containing sequences from a neomycin resistance gene was used as an internal probe for the targeted GK locus. Quantitation of band intensity was performed by phosphorimager analysis (GS-250 Molecular Imager, o-Rad). All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities, maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed a standard rodent chow (Purina Mills, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Females from both transgenic lines were used for most analyses. The gene rescue experiment was conducted using animals from line 37 only. Non-transgenic offspring of similar genetic backgrounds from within the same mouse colony served as controls. Animals were killed at 0600, which corresponds to a fed state (31Nagai K. Nishio T. Nakagawa H. Nakamura S. Fukuda Y. Brain Res. 1978; 142: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), except for those in Fig. 5, which were killed in the afternoon. Total RNA was prepared by acid guanidinium thiocyanate extraction (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA gels, blots, and hybridizations were performed as described previously (28Postic C. Niswender K.D. Decaux J.-F. Parsa R. Shelton K.D. Gouhot B. Pettepher C.C. Granner D.K. Girard J. Magnuson M.A. Genomics. 1995; 29: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A 789-bp rat GK cDNA fragment from pGK.Z1 (24Magnuson M.A. Andreone T.L. Printz R.L. Koch S. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) was used as the probe. The loading control probe was an ∼700-bpHindIII-EcoRI cyclophilin DNA fragment (33Danielson P.E. Forss-Petter S. Brow M.A. Calavetta L. Douglass J. Milner R.J. Sutcliffe J.G. DNA. 1988; 7: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of autoradiograms was performed using NIH Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) after digital scanning. GK values were corrected for loading differences with the cyclophilin value. Western blot analyses were performed as described (34Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2619-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To visualize GK antibody binding, the washed membranes were incubated in a 1:10,000 dilution of donkey anti-sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1 h at room temperature. A solution consisting of 1.25 mm Luminol, 0.2 mm para-coumaric acid, and 0.009% H2O2 in 100 mmTris (pH 8.5) was used to initiate the chemiluminescence reaction. The membranes were then drip-dried, wrapped in polyvinyl chloride film, and exposed to autoradiography film. GK activities in crude liver extracts (as prepared for Western blotting) were estimated by determining the difference in glucose phosphorylation in the presence of 100 mm and 0.5 mm glucose. The final assay mixture contained 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm ATP, 1 mm NADP, either 0.5 or 100 mm glucose, 4 μg/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Boehringer Mannheim), and 100 μl of liver extract. Glucose phosphorylating activity was taken as the increase in NADPH fluorescence measured at 340 nm after 4 min at 32 °C. Tissues were processed for immunocytochemical analysis as described previously (34Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2619-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, GK immunoreactivity was detected using an anti-GST-GK fusion protein antibody (34Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2619-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with a CY3-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Samples were imaged using a Zeiss LSM410 confocal scanning laser microscope with the 543 nm line of a helium/neon laser, and digital images were quantitated using NIH Image software. When expression levels were to be compared, tissues were processed in parallel, sections cut to the same thickness, and immunostaining reactions were conducted in parallel with the same reagents. The sensitivity and base line of the photomultiplier tube in the confocal microscope was adjusted such that the full range of pixel intensities were collected without saturation. Hepatocyte nuclear GK quantification was performed by counting the number of immunofluorescent positive (nuclear signal above cytoplasmic signal) nuclei per high powered field (mm2). Islets were isolated from heterozygous transgenic animals from line 37 and control mice by pancreatic distension and collagenase digestion of the splenic portion of the pancreas (35Sharp D.W. Kemp C.B. Knight M.J. Ballinger W.F. Lacy P.E. Transplantation. 1973; 16: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 36Stefan Y. Meda P. Neufeld M. Orci L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 mm glucose for 40 h. Whole islet immunostaining was performed using affinity-purified anti-GK IgG (34Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2619-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) at a 1:10 dilution. Two-photon excitation microscopy analysis of NAD(P)H autofluorescence in intact islets was performed as described (37Bennett B.D. Jetton T.L. Ying G. Magnuson M.A. Piston D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3647-3651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Results are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Differences are reported as statistically significant at an α value of 0.05. Pronuclear DNA microinjection experiments were performed to generate transgenic mice containing additional copies of the entire GK gene, including both promoter regions and all exons (28Postic C. Niswender K.D. Decaux J.-F. Parsa R. Shelton K.D. Gouhot B. Pettepher C.C. Granner D.K. Girard J. Magnuson M.A. Genomics. 1995; 29: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Three founders were generated, two of which passed the transgene through the germline (animals 37 and 41). The founder that did not pass the transgene was presumed to be mosaic. Transgene inheritance patterns indicated that the exogenous GK gene sequences had integrated into the X chromosome in founder 37 and into an autosome in founder 41. Because of the large size of the transgene, both PCR and Southern blot experiments were performed to exclude fragmentation or rearrangement of the DNA upon integration into the genome. These analyses suggest that transgene integration occurred without any major rearrangements or deletions in both lines of mice (Fig. 1,A–C). Quantitation of Southern blot band intensities (Fig.1 C) indicated that line 37 had ∼1 transgene copy per haploid genome, whereas line 41 had ∼4 copies. To determine whether the downstream GK promoter in the transgene is expressed in liver, GK mRNA, GK activity, and GK immunoreactivity were assayed in transgenic and control mice. In fed animals from line 37, GK mRNA levels were elevated 1.8-fold in heterozygotes and 2.6-fold in homozygotes, compared with the controls (Fig.2 A, left). Similar expression expression levels were evident in line 41; GK mRNA was 1.8- and 2.4-fold greater in the heterozygous and homozygous transgenic mice, respectively (Fig. 2 D). Increased hepatic GK activity (Fig. 2, B and E) and increased GK protein (Fig.2, C and F) were also observed in both lines of mice. To assess the regulation of the transgene in liver, GK mRNA levels were determined in mice fasted for 34 h or fed diets that varied in carbohydrate content. In the 34-h fasted mice GK mRNA expression was decreased in both the transgenic and control mice to very low levels (Fig. 2 A). In addition, hepatic GK mRNA was decreased by ∼70% in mice fed a low carbohydrate diet, compared with those fed a high carbohydrate diet (data not shown). These results indicate that the GK transgene is expressed in liver, that there is an association between gene copy number and gene expression within a given line, and that the expression of the transgene in liver is affected by dietary manipulations known to alter expression of the endogenous GK gene (8Iynedjian P.B. Pilot P.R. Nouspikel T. Milburn J.L. Quaade C. Hughes S. Ucla C. Newgard C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7838-7842Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Magnuson M.A. Andreone T.L. Printz R.L. Koch S. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Identification of GK mRNA and GK immunoreactivity in the liver of a transgene-rescued GK null mouse (as shown below) also provides evidence that the downstream GK promoter in the transgene is transcriptionally active in hepatocytes. The transmission pattern of the GK transgene in line 37 revealed that it had integrated into the X chromosome, as noted above. In this line, hepatic GK mRNA was elevated 1.8-fold in heterozygotes (3 gene copies) and 2.6-fold in homozygotes (4 gene copies) compared with controls (2 gene copies). Since the increase in hepatic GK mRNA was nearly proportional to the number of GK genes, the GK transgene appears to escape X chromosome inactivation. Other X-linked transgenes have also been shown to escape inactivation (41Disteche C.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 17-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 42Wu H. Fassler R. Schnieke A. Barker D. Lee K.-H. Chapman V. Francke U. Jaenisch R. Development. 1992; 116: 687-695PubMed Google Scholar, 43Krumlauf R. Chapman V.M. Hammer R.E. Brinster R. Tilghman S.H. Nature. 1986; 319: 224-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). While both lines of mice showed increased GK gene expression in liver, thus suggesting position-independent expression of the downstream promoter in the transgene, the design of these studies, which did not use a reporter gene strategy, makes it difficult to conclude whether expression is also copy number-dependent. The combination of position-independent, and copy number-dependent transgene expression are accepted criteria by which the presence of a locus control region within a gene locus is defined (44Li Q. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6087-6096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 47Ganss R. Montoliu L. Monaghan A.P. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3083-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that GK translocates from the cytoplasm to nucleus in certain metabolic states (48Miwa I. Mitsuyama S. Toyoda Y. Nonogaki T. Aoki S. Okuda J. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 49Toyoda Y. Miwa I. Kamiya M. Ogiso S. Nonogaki T. Aoki S. Okuda J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, to examine the subcellular location of GK in the livers of transgenic mice, we performed immunocytochemical studies. In livers from fed control mice, GK immunoreactivity displayed a peri-central zonation pattern typical of GK and other glycolytic enzymes (50Moorman A.F. de Boer P.A. Charles R. Lamers W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with only a few faintly immunopositive nuclei being observed (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the livers of fed transgenic mice showed both more pronounced nuclear GK immunostaining (Fig. 3 B) and cytosolic GK immunoreactivity that was more intense than the controls (Fig. 3, compare Aand B). Approximately 5-fold more nuclei stained positively for GK in both homozygous and heterozygous transgenic livers (Fig.3 C). In addition, the peri-central zone of both nuclear and cytoplasmic GK immunoreactivity was expanded in transgenic livers (data not shown). While the functional significance of GK localization in the nucleus of the hepatocyte remains to be determined, the enhanced nuclear localization of GK in transgenic hepatocytes appears to reflect nuclear sequestration of excess GK by binding to GKRP, since the latter has been found to be a nuclear protein (48Miwa I. Mitsuyama S. Toyoda Y. Nonogaki T. Aoki S. Okuda J. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 51Toyoda Y. Miwa I. Satake S. Anai M. Oka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given that alterations in GK gene expression profoundly affect the plasma glucose concentration (1Niswender K.D. Shiota M. Postic C. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22604-22609Google Scholar), increased binding of GK to GKRP in these mice may be a mechanism that protects the animals from the physiologic effects of excess hepatic GK catalytic activity. To assess expression of the upstream GK promoter in the transgene, we used quantitative methods to examine GK immunoreactivity in pancreatic islets. Given that small fragments of the upstream GK promoter have previously been shown to be expressed in both the islet and other rare neuroendocrine cell types (13Jetton T. Liang Y. Pettepher C.C.

Magnuson M.A. Baba S. Kaneko T. Diabetes. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam1994: 193-197Google Scholar), we expected that a transgene with ∼15 kb of additional 5′-flanking sequence for the upstream promoter would cause increased islet GK gene expression. Surprisingly, in freshly isolated pancreata, the amount of immunoreactive GK in islets from both lines of transgenic mice was less than the controls: 66% and 74%, respectively, for line 37 and 41 (Fig. 4, A andB). Representative islets from a line 37 mouse, compared with a control mouse, are shown in Fig. 4 (C andD). However, since glucose is known to regulate islet GK content (20Liang Y. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16863-16866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Liang Y. Jetton T.L. Zimmerman E.C. Najafi H. Berner D.K. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and since these mice have a hypoglycemic phenotype, as is described in detail elsewhere (1Niswender K.D. Shiota M. Postic C. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22604-22609Google Scholar), decreased islet GK content may reflect differences in the plasma glucose concentrations in transgenic mice. To test this possibility, GK immunoreactivity was assessed after culturing islets under equivalent glucose conditions. After culturing control and transgenic islets from line 37 in 20 mmglucose, 1.5-fold more immunoreactive GK was present in the transgenic islets (Table I), a difference that parallels the addition of the single extra GK gene in these mice (3versus 2 gene copies). To further validate this result, differences in glucose metabolism were quantitatively assessed using two photon excitation microscopy to measure changes in NAD(P)H autofluorescence (37Bennett B.D. Jetton T.L. Ying G. Magnuson M.A. Piston D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3647-3651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The 1.5-fold increase in GK immunoreactivity observed after culturing the transgenic islets in 20 mmglucose was matched by a 1.4-fold increase in glucose-stimulated NAD(P)H autofluorescence. Finally, detection of GK immunoreactivity in β cells of the transgene-rescued mouse also provides clear evidence that the GK gene locus transgene is expressed in the islet (see below).Table IQuantitation of GK immunoreactivity and NAD(P)H autofluorescence in isolated islets after culture in 20 mm glucoseControlTransgenicRatioGK immunofluorescence intensity101 ± 3 (6)153 ± 4 (6)*1.5 ± 0.04NAD(P)H autofluorescence response to 30 mm glucose1.76 ± 0.08 (2)2.47 ± 0.005 (2)**1.41 ± 0.06Transgenic and control islets were isolated as described and cultured for 40 h in equimolar glucose conditions.

Open table in a new tab Transgenic and control islets were isolated as described and cultured for 40 h in equimolar glucose conditions.

The number of animals in each group is indicated in parentheses (*, p < 10−6, **, p < 0.05). These results indicate that transgenic islets, when exposed to the same glucose concentrations as controls, express a proportionally greater amount of GK. Moreover, like the liver, the amount of GK immunoreactivity also appears to be GK gene copy number-dependent. While an extensive analysis of transgene expression in other neuroendocrine cell types known to express the islet GK isoform was not performed (13Jetton T. Liang Y. Pettepher C.C. Zimmerman E.C. Cox F.G. Horvath K. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3641-3654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GK mRNA levels were elevated to a similar extent (∼1.6-fold) in a sample of pooled transgenic pituitaries, suggesting that the GK transgene is probably expressed in all locations where the endogenous upstream GK promoter is transcriptionally active. The effects of complete inactivation of the endogenous GK gene by gene targeting have been reported by two different groups (6Grupe A. Hultgren B. Ryan A. Ma Y.H. Bauer M. Stewart T.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Bali D. Svetlanov A. Lee H.-W. Fusco-DeMane D. Leiser M. Li B. Barzilai N. Surana M. Hou H. Fleischer N. DePinho R.

While the time of death varies greatly in the two different studies, the availability of these mice provided an opportunity to directly test the expression of the GK transgene in the absence of endogenous GK gene expression. GK transgenic mice were were first crossed with the heterozygous null GK mice generated and characterized by Bali et al. (7Bali D. Svetlanov A. Lee H.-W. Fusco-DeMane D. Leiser M. Li B. Barzilai N. Surana M. Hou H. Fleischer N. DePinho R. Rossetti L. Efrat S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21464-21467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) to generate animals that were heterozygous for both the GK transgene and targeted endogenous GK alleles. The double heterozygous mice were then intercrossed, and 56 offspring were generated and characterized. Because the genomic Southern blot analysis was complicated by the presence of up to four GK genes in some mice (Fig.5 A), variable band intensities, and a random insertion of the targeting vector in the genome of the GK null mice (see extra band for the neomycin resistance gene probe in Fig. 5 A), all candidate rescued mice were test-mated to a wild type mouse to verify transmission of one null GK allele to all offspring. From these matings, a single female mouse was identified that passed one null GK allele to all offspring (n = 7,p < 0.01), as shown in Fig. 5 B. This animal was killed for tissue analysis at ∼12 weeks of age and was euglycemic at that time (104 mg/dl). GK immunostaining in both liver and pancreatic tissue sections in the rescued mouse were indistinguishable from a control mouse (Fig. 5 C). RNA blot analysis also indicated that there was a similar amount of hepatic GK mRNA expressed compared with the control (Fig. 5 D). There was no evidence of transgene misexpression in a survey of several other tissues that do not express endogenous GK (Fig. 5 D). More importantly, the transgene-rescued mouse lived well past the time when the GK null mice died (6Grupe A. Hultgren B. Ryan A. Ma Y.H. Bauer M. Stewart T.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Bali D. Svetlanov A. Lee H.-W. Fusco-DeMane D. Leiser M. Li B. Barzilai N. Surana M. Hou H. Fleischer N. DePinho R.

While the results of this experiment need to be interpreted with caution, it suggests that the GK gene locus transgene is able to fully compensate for the lack of endogenous GK gene expression in the GK null mice, thus providing additional evidence that the 83-kb DNA fragment tested in these mice defines the mouse GK gene locus. The analyses performed here indicate that an 83-kb DNA fragment spanning from about −55 to +28 kilobase pairs relative to the liver transcription start site defines a functional mouse GK gene locus. By all criteria applied, expression of the GK gene locus transgene fully recapitulates the patterns of expression and regulation that characterize the endogenous GK gene. Given this, these mice can be used to explore the physiological effects of increased GK gene copy on blood glucose homeostasis, as we describe in a related study (1Niswender K.D. Shiota M. Postic C. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22604-22609Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1990198168,"Mammalian RNase HI has been shown to specifically cleave the initiator RNA of Okazaki fragments at the RNA-DNA junction, leaving a single ribonucleotide attached to the 5′-end of the downstream DNA segment. This monoribonucleotide can then be removed by the mammalian 5′- to 3′-exo-/endonuclease, a RAD2 homolog-1 (RTH-1) class nuclease, also known as flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1). Although FEN-1/RTH-1 nuclease often requires an upstream primer for efficient activity, the presence of an upstream primer is usually inhibitory or neutral for removal of this 5′-monoribonucleotide. Using model Okazaki fragment substrates, we found that DNA ligase I can seal a 5′-monoribonucleotide into DNA. When both ligase and FEN-1/RTH-1 were present simultaneously, some of the 5′-monoribonucleotides were ligated into DNA, while others were released. Thus, a 5′-monoribonucleotide, particularly one that is made resistant to FEN-1/RTH-1-directed cleavage by extension of an inhibitory upstream primer, can be ligated into the chromosome, despite the presence of FEN-1/RTH-1 nuclease. DNA ligase I was able to seal different monoribonucleotides into the DNA for all substrates tested, with an efficiency of 1–13% that of ligating DNA. These embedded monoribonucleotides can be removed by the combined action of RNase HI, cutting on the 5′-side, and FEN-1/RTH-1 nuclease, cleaving on the 3′-side. After FEN-1/RTH-1 action and extension by polymerization, DNA ligase I can join the entirely DNA strands to complete repair."

Hence, the simple view of nitrogen regulation by four GATA factors in yeast, but only one key regulator in filamentous ascomycetes seems no longer valid. Nitrogen metabolite repression controls the synthesis of a range of enzymes required for utilization of nitrogen sources in such a way that primary nitrogen sources, like ammonia or glutamine, are utilized preferentially (1Cooper T.G.

Several structural as well as regulatory genes involved in this process have been isolated and characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Cooper T.G. Esser K. Lemke P.A. The Mycota III: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 139-169Google Scholar). To date, five global nitrogen regulatory factors are known to participate in the regulated transcription of nitrogen catabolic genes in yeast. Four of them, Gln3p, Dal80p (also termed Uga43p), Nil1p (also termed Gat1p), and Gzf3p (also termed Nil2p), are DNA-binding proteins that contain a single GATA-type zinc finger, recognizing the consensus motif GATA (4Coffman J.A.

Gln3p and Nil1p are transcriptional activators whereas Dal80p and Gzf3p (proposed to repress Gln3p- and Nil1p-mediated transcription possibly by competing for some binding sites) act as negative regulators of multiple nitrogen catabolic genes. The fifth factor, Ure2p, is considered to be a negative regulator of Gln3p via direct binding (10Blinder D. Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of our understanding of regulatory circuits in multicellular fungi is based on Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa. In these species a number of genes have been identified as having an influence on the nitrogen regulatory network directly or indirectly (2Crawford N.M. Arst Jr., H.N. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 115-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3Marzluf G.A. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In contrast to S. cerevisiae, only one GATA factor has been implicated in nitrogen metabolite repression in both fungi at present: AREA from A. nidulans and NIT2, its homologue from N. crassa. Both proteins are highly related positive acting wide domain regulators (11Fu Y.H. Marzluf G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1056-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Kudla B. Caddick M.X. Langdon T. Martinez-Rossi N.M. Bennett C.F. Sibley S. Davies R.W. Arst Jr., H.N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The activity of NIT2 is modulated by the negative acting factor NMR through direct protein-protein interaction in N. crassa (13Xiao X. Fu Y.H. Marzluf G.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8861-8868Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Employing electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis, at least three GATA binding activities other than AREA have been distinguished in A. nidulans (14Peters D.G. Caddick M.X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5164-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This suggests the existence of additional GATA factors possibly involved in nitrogen metabolite repression, thus resembling the situation in S. cerevisiae. However, a number of possibilities other than nitrogen regulation may pertain since fungal GATA factors have also been shown to be involved in regulatory circuits as different as iron metabolism in Ustilago maydis, mating type switching in S. cerevisiae, blue-light signal transduction, and circadian rhythmicity in N. crassa(15Crosthwaite S.K. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Science. 1997; 276: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 16Linden H. Macino G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 17Sil A.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7091-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recently, a second GATA factor-encoding gene from A. nidulans has been described that appears to play a role in sexual development (19Chae K.-S. Kim J.H. Choi Y. Han D.M. Jahng K.-Y. Mol. Cells. 1995; 5: 146-150Google Scholar) GenBankTM accession number U70043). Hitherto, the knowledge about nitrogen control mechanisms in other fungi is rather fragmentary. The filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum is the most important industrial producer of the β-lactam antibiotic penicillin. The synthesis of this secondary metabolite is assumed to involve nitrogen metabolite repression (20Kolar M. Holzmann K. Weber G. Leitner E. Schwab H. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 17: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,21Martin J.F. Lopez-Nieto M.J. Castro J.M. Cortez J. Romero J. Ramos F.R. Cabtoral J.M. Alvarez E. Dominquez M.G. Barredo J.L.

VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1986: 41-75Google Scholar), among other regulatory circuits. Recently, we have isolated theareA/nit2 homologue nre from P. chrysogenum and demonstrated, besides its AREA/NIT2 homologous function, specific binding of an NRE fusion protein to double GATA elements in the promoter regions of the nitrate assimilation and penicillin biosynthesis gene clusters (22Haas H. Bauer B. Redl B. Stöffler G. Marzluf G.A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Haas H. Marzluf G.A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The aim of the present work was to identify and characterize additional GATA factors involved in nitrogen control in filamentous fungi. To further our understanding of this complex regulatory network, we have cloned and characterized the gene encoding NREB, a new DNA binding GATA factor from P. chrysogenum that is able to act as a repressor of nitrogen catabolic genes. The P. chrysogenum strain Q176, provided by the Biochemie GmbH (Kundl, Austria), was used throughout this study. All liquid cultures were inoculated with 108 conidiospores at 25 °C in 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks on a rotary shaker (250 rpm) in 250 ml of minimal medium containing 30 mm NaNO3, 7 mmKCl, 2 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 0.3 mm FeSO4·7H2O, 25 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 2% sucrose, and trace elements according to Vogel. For Northern analysis, nitrate was replaced by the respective nitrogen source, and sucrose was replaced by xylose. Unless otherwise noted, pBluescript KS (Stratagene) and Escherichia coli DH5α were used as plasmid vector and host, respectively. Fungal DNA and RNA were isolated according to Yelton (24Yelton M.M. Hamer J.E. Timberlake W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and using RNAzolTM (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.), respectively. A 56-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s).fragment of the zinc finger-encoding region of different putative GATA factors was amplified utilizing two degenerate oligonucleotide primers, 5′-ACNCCNYTNTGGMG (Y = T or C; M = A or C; N = any nt; P = A or G) derived from the amino acid sequence Thr-Pro-Leu-Trp-Arg and 5′-APNCCPCANGCPTTPCA, antisense according to the amino acid sequence Cys-Asn-Ala-Cys-Gly-Leu. In an alternative approach, GATA factor-encoding cDNA was amplified according to the RACE protocol of Frohman et al. (25Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) as described previously (26Haas H. Angermayr K. Stöffler G. Gene. 1997; 184: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The amplification products were gel purified and subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). For determination of the 5′-end of the nreB cDNA, totalPenicillium RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions and employing the oligonucleotide 5′–AGTCTCGTACAATCATC (corresponding to nt 777–793 in Fig. 1) as primer. Subsequently, this cDNA was d(A) tailed and amplified by PCR using the (dT)17-adapter primer, the adapter primer (25Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar), and the nested specific oligonucleotide 5′-CAGCCTCAGATCGTGGCGGGA (corresponding to nt 359–379 in Fig. 1). The nreB specific 331-bp fragment obtained was subcloned into pGEM-T vector and sequenced. To isolate a genomic fragment containing the nreB gene and the adjacent non-coding regions, a λEMBL3A P. chrysogenumphage gene library was screened using a radiolabeled PCR fragment of the cDNA clone (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two clones with strong hybridization signals were isolated out of 6 × 104 clones. A total of 7.3 kb was subcloned into plasmid vectors. Sequencing was carried out by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar). Generally, 15 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gels and blotted onto Hybond N membranes (Amersham Corp.). Hybridization probes were generated by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-CACATTGACTGACGATA and 5′-AGTCTCGTACAATCATC as primers for the coding region of nreB, 5′-GGCTTCGGAGACGTATG and 5′-GGTTGAGTCGATAAGGAAAG for the 5′-upstream region of nreB, 5′-TTCTTCCAGAACTCGAG and 5′-GCCAGGACCCGGTCAATTT for the 3′-downstream region of the first polyadenylation site of nreB, 5′-CCCGCCGACCTCATCAC and 5′-GAGTTTCAGGAACAGGC for nre (22Haas H.

Friedlin E. Stöffler G. Redl B. Gene. 1993; 126: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A 228-bp fragment encoding the N-terminal 76 amino acids of NREB was amplified from a 5-kb EcoRI fragment using oligonucleotides 5′-TTTGAATTCATGGCGACCACATTGA and 5′-TTTCTGCAGTTACTTGCGCTTAGGGCCT (corresponding to nt 1–16 and 213–228, respectively, in Fig. 1), which carry add-on restriction enzyme cleavage sites forEcoRI and PstI, respectively. Subsequently, the amplified product was cleaved with EcoRI and PstI and ligated into the respective restriction sites of pMal-cRI (New England Biolabs). After verification of proper integration of the relevant fragment into the plasmid by sequencing, the pMal-nreB plasmid was transformed into E. coliDH5α. Expression and purification of the MBP::NREB fusion protein were carried out as described by the manufacturer. The following restriction fragments of the niaD-niiA intergenic region, which contain GATA motifs, were used for mobility shift analysis for binding of MBP::NREB: a 100-bp SplI-SacII fragment (F100) and a 120-bp SacII-NcoI fragment (F120). Labeling was performed by end filling of 5′-overhangs with Klenow DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [α-32P]dATP. A 300-bp fragment of the nreB promoter region (nt −236–64) containing five GATA motifs was amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-ACATCATCACCGGCAGC and 5′-TGCCGCAATTCTGGCAA (corresponding to nt −236–−221 and 48–64 in Fig. 1, respectively) as primers.NarI treatment of the amplified product yielded two fragments, 130 bp (F130) and 170 bp (F170) in length, containing two and three GATA core elements, respectively. A synthetic 20-bp fragment (F20) with a single GATA site, which was surrounded by the same nucleotide environment as in the 170-bp fragment, was created by annealing two oligonucleotides (5′-TTCTTTCCTTATCGACTCAA and 5′-GGTTGAGTCGATAAGGAAAG) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl after incubation for 5 min at 90 °C and cooling to 4 °C. All fragments were purified on non-denaturating gels and radioactively end-labeled by filling in with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I using [α-32P]dCTP (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). NREB binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl of 12 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol, using 20,000 cpm of the respective 32P-end-labeled DNA fragment and different amounts of MBP::NREB. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and subsequently loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 × Tris-borate buffer (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were dried and autoradiographed. Quantification of the intensity of shifted bands in comparison with the respective free probes was performed using a Phosphor Storage Imaging System, model Storm 840 (Molecular Dynamics). For missing contact analysis, the end-labeled DNA fragments were partially depurinated prior to gel band mobility shift analysis. After separation, free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were isolated, cleaved at purine residues, and analyzed by electrophoresis in a sequencing gel and autoradiography as described previously (23Haas H. Marzluf G.A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). AxylP:nreB fusion gene was generated by PCR-mediated ligation (31Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The 1.6-kb upstream region of the xylanase promoter fragment was amplified by PCR from a subcloned SalI fragment (30Haas H. Friedlin E. Stöffler G. Redl B. Gene. 1993; 126: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) employing the M13 reverse sequencing primer and the oligonucleotide 5′-CAATGTGGTCGCCATGTTGGTTCTTCGAG. A 1.8-kb nreB fragment (bp 1–1822 in Fig. 1) was amplified recruiting the primers 5′-CGAAGAACCAACATGGCGACCACATTGAC and 5′-GGGCCAGGACCCGGTCA. The overlapping PCR products were gel purified, and equimolar amounts were used as templates for a second PCR with the left- and right-most primers. The 3.4-kb PCR fusion product was inserted into pGEM-T, resulting in pXNREB. The junction as well as the coding regions of the fused product were verified by sequencing. For cotransformation of pXNREB into P. chrysogenum Q176 the plasmid pBC1003 carrying the Tn5-phleomycin resistance gene under the control of the isopenicillin-N-synthetase promoter fromP. chrysogenum was used as the selection marker (32Kolar M. Punt P.J. van den Hondel C.A. Schwab H. Gene. 1988; 62: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Protoplasts were transformed according to Cantoral et al.(33Cantoral J.M. Diez B. Barredo J.L. Alvarez E. Martin J.F. Bio/Technology. 1987; 5: 494-497Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on minimal medium containing 10 μg/ml phleomycin (Sigma). Screening of positive clones was performed by PCR. To obtain homokaryotic transformants, colonies from single homokaryotic spores were picked, and genomic integration of the expression construct was verified by PCR and Southern analysis. Three different transformants carrying a single copy of pXNREB integrated ectopically were selected for growth tests and Northern analysis. For disruption of nreB, a 1.9-kbHindIII-ClaI-fragment carrying the Tn5-phleomycin resistance gene under the control of the isopenicillin-N-synthetase promoter was inserted between theHindIII and NarI sites of the nreBgene to replace 1.2 kb containing the complete coding region. Subsequently, a 5.7-kb Asp700-SacII fragment containing the selection marker with 1.1 kb 5′-upstream and 2.7 kb 3′-downstream flanking regions of nreB was gel purified from vector sequences. For transformation of P. chrysogenumapproximately 10 μg of purified DNA was used, and transformants were selected for resistance to phleomycin. Screening for positive clones was performed via PCR and Southern blot analysis. The various members of the GATA protein family are related by a high degree of similarity within their DNA binding domain. To isolate additional GATA factors from Penicillium, two different PCR-aided strategies that used degenerate oligonucleotide primers derived from two regions conserved in most fungal GATA factors were applied. In the first approach, cDNA was used as a template to amplify the 3′ part of the GATA factor-encoding transcripts as described previously (26Haas H. Angermayr K. Stöffler G. Gene. 1997; 184: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) according to the RACE protocol of Frohman et al. (25Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). In the second approach, genomic DNA was used as a template for conventional PCR to amplify a 56-bp fragment encoding the zinc finger region of the GATA factors. Both strategies yielded fragments of three different GATA factor-encoding genes: first, the already characterized major nitrogen regulatory gene nre; second, sreP, a putative homologue of the siderophore regulatory gene urbs1 from the basidiomycete U. maydis (26Haas H. Angermayr K. Stöffler G. Gene. 1997; 184: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); and third, a new gene, designated nreB, encoding a GATA-type zinc finger motif similar to that of Dal80p and Gzf3p from S. cerevisiae. To characterize the complete gene, including the adjacent non-coding regions, a 12-kb chromosomal clone was isolated from a λEMBL3AP. chrysogenum phage library using the amplified cDNA clone as probe and subcloned into plasmid vectors. Subsequently, a 7.3-kb SalI-EcoRI fragment containingnreB was sequenced in its entirety (Fig.1). Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences revealed an open reading frame of 894 bp interrupted by a single 102-bp intron, 3′ of the zinc finger-encoding region. The consensus sequences for the 5′- and 3′-borders of the intron, GTPNGY and YAG, respectively, as well as CTPAY, the putative internal consensus sequence for lariat formation, are conserved (34Gurr S.J. Uncles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Kinghorn J.R. Gene Structure in Eucaryotic Microbes. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1987: 93-193Google Scholar). The deduced P. chrysogenum NREB protein displays a calculated molecular mass of 32.7 kDa. Searches in several data bases using the BLAST alignment computer program (35Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71321) Google Scholar) confirmed that the cloned gene codes for a putative member of the GATA family. NREB exhibits the strongest similarity to Dal80p and Gzf3p fromS. cerevisiae (6Cunningham T.S. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6205-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Urrestarazu A. Jauniaux J.C. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The completion of the budding yeast genome sequencing project has made it possible to determine the exact number of genes of a particular type. In budding yeast, four CX 2CX 17CX 2C-type GATA factors (Gln3p, Dal80p, Nil1p, and Gzf3p) have been characterized, and all four participate in nitrogen regulation. Alignment of the DNA binding motifs indicates 86% amino acid identity of NREB to both Dal80p and Gzf3p, 76% to NRE (Fig. 2), but only 56% and 64% to the two GATA-type zinc fingers of SREP (data not shown). In addition, sequence similarity of NREB, Dal80p, and Gzf3p is not exclusively limited to the zinc finger region. All three proteins display a putative leucine zipper motif in the C terminus (Fig. 2). In Penicillium NREB, the heptad pattern of hydrophobic amino acids is even longer and includes 11 residues (Fig.1) in a region predicted to form a coiled coil structure by computer analysis using the ExPASy tools software package (36Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3482) Google Scholar). Although not all of these residues are leucines, mutational analysis of the GCN4 leucine zipper has proved that both aromatic and aliphatic residues can functionally replace leucine residues without affecting the dimerization properties of this motif (37Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In contrast to NRE and all other identified positive acting GATA factors involved in nitrogen regulation in fungi, NREB lacks regions rich in acidic residues putatively involved in transcriptional activation and in this respect also resembles Dal80p and Gzf3p. This is in accordance with the proposed role of NREB as an inhibitor of transcription. Several additional motifs have been identified in the amino acid sequence of NREB. Among them are three putative nuclear targeting sequences, a 4-residue pattern at amino acid position 72 and the bipartite consensus sequence at positions 221 and 235 (38Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 19 putative phosphorylation sites, including 4 for cAMP and cGMP dependent protein kinases, 5 for protein kinase C, and 10 for casein kinase, are detectable in the sequence (39Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The motif S(T)PXX, occurring at high frequencies in gene regulatory proteins, appears six times in NREB (40Suzuki M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 61-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The obvious similarity of the nitrogen metabolite repression system in filamentous ascomycetes gave rise to speculation that nreBhomologous genes may also exist in the genetic model organisms A. nidulans and N. crassa. Results of PCR amplification and subsequent sequence analysis of the obtained fragments support this assumption and prove that this gene is not unique toPenicillium (3Marzluf G.A. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). 2I. Zadra and H. Haas, unpublished results.Applying different PCR approaches, besides NREB or SREP homologues, no other CX 2CX 17CX 2C-type GATA factor-encoding genes could be amplified fromPenicillium, Aspergillus, orNeurospora. Our results suggest that the basic mechanism of nitrogen regulation is conserved in S. cerevisiae and filamentous fungi. In both systems, positive and negative acting GATA factors are engaged, but in contrast to yeast, only two GATA factors appear to be involved in nitrogen regulation in filamentous fungi. To examine if transcription of nreB is subject to nitrogen control, total RNA was isolated from mycelia grown in different nitrogen sources and probed with nreB. Subsequently, the blots were stripped and hybridized with the major nitrogen regulatory gene nre, the nitrate reductase-encoding gene niaD, and the γ-actin-encoding gene as a loading control (Fig.3). In mycelia grown in the presence of various derepressing nitrogen sources, nitrate, urea, alanine, or hypoxanthine, two transcripts, 1.5 and 1.8 kb in length, were detectable. In contrast, cells grown in ammonia or glutamine exhibited low levels of nreB transcript. To investigate the mode of induction of nreB expression, mycelia were grown in glutamine and subsequently transferred into medium containing nitrate as sole nitrogen source. nreBtranscripts were detectable 15 min after transfer. Interestingly, the steady state level of nreB mRNA displayed maximal expression about 1 h after derepression as already demonstrated for the nre gene (29Haas H. Marx F. Graessle S. Stöffler G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In mycelia grown for 36 h in a derepressing nitrogen source, the 1.5- and 1.8-kb mRNA species appeared approximately equimolar, whereas in the phase of derepression (20 and 60 min after shift), the shorter transcript was about 3-fold enriched. Although the significance of this observation remains to be elucidated one can speculate that the two transcripts might possess different features due to their different 3′-ends for example in mRNA stability. In this respect it is interesting that Plattet al. (41Platt A. Langdon T. Arst Jr., H.N. Kirk D. Tollervey D. Sanchez J.M. Caddick M.X. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2791-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that nitrogen metabolite signaling involves the 3′-untranslated region of areAtranscripts, encoding the major nitrogen regulatory gene of A. nidulans. In summary, our results suggest that expression of nreB is subject to nitrogen metabolite repression similar to that of the nitrogen regulatory gene nre and the nitrogen catabolic geneniaD. This expression pattern is reminiscent of that of yeast DAL80 (6Cunningham T.S. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6205-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast, transcription ofGZF3 is only slightly reduced by repressing nitrogen sources (8Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Urrestarazu A. Jauniaux J.C. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine the nreB transcription start points and polyadenylation sites, 5′- and 3′-RACE protocols as well as primer extension experiments were carried out. The single transcription start point detected is located 13 nt upstream of the putative start codon (Fig. 1). The two polyadenylation sites found are located at nt 1320 and 1640. Hence, the leng"
https://openalex.org/W2088813868,"Activation of transcription factor NF-κB involves the signal-dependent degradation of basally phosphorylated inhibitors such as IκBα and IκBβ. The gene encoding IκBα is under NF-κB control, which provides a negative feedback loop to terminate the induced NF-κB response. However, recent studies have identified a hypophosphorylated pool of IκBβ that shields nuclear NF-κB from inhibition by newly synthesized IκBα. In the present work, we provide three lines of evidence indicating that this protection mechanism is regulated by the C-terminal PEST domain of IκBβ. First, disruption of two basal phosphoacceptors present in the IκBβ PEST domain (Ser-313 and Ser-315) yields a mutant that forms ternary complexes with NF-κB and its target DNA-binding site. Second, based on in vitromixing experiments, these ternary complexes are resistant to the inhibitory action of IκBα. Third, mutants of IκBβ that are defective for phosphorylation at Ser-313 and Ser-315 fail to efficiently block NF-κB-directed transcription in vivo, whereas replacement of these two IκBβ residues with a phosphoserine mimetic generates a fully functional repressor. Taken together, our findings suggest that the functional fate of NF-κB when bound to IκBβ is critically dependent on the phosphorylation status of the IκBβ PEST domain.

Inducible members of the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors mediate rapid cellular responses to stress-related, mitogenic, and pro-apoptotic signals (reviewed in Ref. 1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). The most well characterized form of NF-κB consists of two DNA-binding subunits, termed p50 and RelA, which are sequestered in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells by basally phosphorylated IκB proteins (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Prior studies have defined a general three-step process for NF-κB activation involving signal-dependent phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IκB at N-terminal sites, which targets the inhibitor for degradation by the 26S proteasome (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In turn, this proteolytic event exposes subcellular localization motifs on NF-κB that direct the transcription factor to the nuclear compartment (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Within a given cell type, another layer of complexity in the NF-κB signaling pathway arises from the expression of multiple isoforms of IκB, including IκBα and IκBβ (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Although both of these inhibitors are basally phosphorylated and subject to signal-dependent degradation, recent studies indicate that IκBα and IκBβ are regulated by distinct mechanisms that affect the duration of nuclear NF-κB activity (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 2Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, activation cues that selectively trigger IκBα degradation are typically associated with a transient pattern of nuclear NF-κB expression, whereas the concomitant loss of IκBβ correlates with a persistent NF-κB response (2Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 3McKinsey T.A. Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. Al-Murrani S.W. Green P.L. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In further contrast to IκBβ, the gene encoding IκBα is rapidly induced by NF-κB (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). This relationship establishes a negative feedback pathway in which newly synthesized IκBα can facilitate a transient mode of NF-κB action (4Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, under stimulatory conditions that lead to prolonged NF-κB activation, cells may express a hypophosphorylated form of IκBβ that binds NF-κB and shields it from feedback inhibition by IκBα (5Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). The precise molecular mechanism by which NF-κB/IκBβ complexes escape from the inhibitory action of IκBα during a persistent NF-κB response remains unclear. In this report, we provide evidence for the presence of regulatory serine residues within the C-terminal PEST domain of IκBβ that affect its capacity to either terminate or preserve the functional expression of nuclear NF-κB. Specifically, when overexpressed in mammalian cells, mutants of IκBβ containing alanine substitutions for Ser-313 and Ser-315 fail to efficiently block NF-κB-directed transcription relative to the wild type inhibitor. These PEST mutants of IκBβ are hypophosphorylated in vivo and form ternary complexes with NF-κB and DNA that are resistant to dissociation by IκBα in vitro. In contrast, replacement of Ser-313 and Ser-315 with aspartic acid, which can act as a phosphoserine mimetic (7Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 8Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), rescues the NF-κB inhibitory function of IκBβ. These findings indicate that the PEST domain of IκBβ plays dual roles in the control of NF-κB activity, depending on the phosphorylation status of Ser-313 and Ser-315. cDNAs encoding RelA (9Ruben S.M.

Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) analyses have established that IκBβ is a tripartite inhibitor containing (i) an N-terminal response domain required for signal-dependent breakdown, (ii) a central NF-κB-interactive domain composed of six ankyrin repeat motifs, and (iii) a C-terminal PEST domain that harbors two consensus phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (CKII). We recently demonstrated that the PEST domain of IκBβ is basally phosphorylated at serine residues (14Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, five serines in this domain are clustered within or near the two consensus CKII motifs ((Ser/Thr)-Xaa-Xaa-(Glu/Asp); Ref. 24Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To initially explore which of these PEST residues are phosphoacceptors, a series of specific amino acid substitutions were introduced into the full-length IκBβ protein (Fig. 1 A), and the corresponding cDNA expression vectors were transfected into A293T cells. After metabolic radiolabeling with 32Pi, ectopic IκBβ proteins were immunopurified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). Substitution of alanine for Ser-313 and Ser-315 (Mu-1) resulted in a 3-fold reduction in phosphoryl group transfer to wild type IκBβ (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and2), whereas disruption of all five serines in this PEST region almost completely abolished basal phosphorylation (Mu-3; Fig.1 B, lane 4). In contrast, replacement of Ser-313 and Ser-315 with the phosphoserine mimetic aspartic acid (7Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 8Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) partially restored the phosphorylation defect of Mu-1 (∼75% of wild type; Fig. 1 B, lane 3). However, these aspartic acid mutations failed to rescue phosphorylation when introduced into the serine-depleted PEST background (Mu-4; Fig. 1 B,lane 5). All of these PEST mutants were expressed at comparable levels in vivo (data not shown). These data suggest that the IκBβ PEST domain is phosphorylated on multiple serines by a cooperative mechanism that is dependent on phosphoryl group transfer to Ser-313 and/or Ser-315. To directly test whether IκBβ is phosphorylated at Ser-313 and Ser-315, site-directed mutants containing threonine rather than serine at both positions were prepared and overexpressed in A293T cells. After biosynthetic radiolabeling with 32Pi, ectopic IκBβ proteins were immunopurified and subjected to two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis. Consistent with our prior findings (14Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), control experiments performed with wild type IκBβ revealed phosphorylation exclusively at serine residues (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, analysis of the threonine mutant (designated S313T/S315T) revealed the presence of both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Similar qualitative results were obtained with IκBβ mutants harboring single threonine substitutions at either position (data not shown). These findings indicate that Ser-313 and Ser-315 both serve as phosphoacceptors in vivo. Suyang et al. (Ref. 5Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar) have identified a hypophosphorylated species of endogenous IκBβ that forms stable complexes with NF-κB. Unlike wild type IκBβ, this species fails to block NF-κB DNA binding activity in vitro. Having defined phosphorylation-defective variants of IκBβ (Fig. 1), we next explored their potential to recapitulate the unusual functional phenotype of the hypophosphorylated form of IκBβ described by Suyang et al. (5Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For these studies, A293T cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for the p50 and RelA subunits of NF-κB along with plasmids encoding FLAG epitope-tagged IκBβ proteins. Nuclear extracts were prepared and cross-linked to 32P-labeled κB oligonucleotides. To specifically detect NF-κB/IκBβ complexes bound to target DNA, the resultant adducts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of RelA (Fig. 2 A). PEST mutants containing alanine substitutions for Ser-313 and Ser-315 formed stable ternary complexes with NF-κB and DNA, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation with RelA (Mu-1; Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Similar results were obtained with the serine-depleted PEST mutant of IκBβ (Mu-3; Fig. 2 A, lane 5). In contrast, PEST mutants containing phosphoserine mimetics at positions 313 and 315 associated with DNA-bound NF-κB at much lower efficiencies, provided that the neighboring serine residues were preserved (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 6). We conclude that phosphorylation of Ser-313 and Ser-315 in IκBβ is necessary but not sufficient to block ternary complex formation. Coupled with the finding that the phosphorylation status of Ser-313 and Ser-315 affects phosphoryl group transfer to vicinal serines (Fig.1 B), it seems likely that the hypophosphorylated form of endogenous IκBβ described by Suyang et al. (5Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) lacks modifications at these two PEST sites. Another proposed property of the hypophosphorylated form of IκBβ expressed in vivo is its ability to shield NF-κB from inhibition by newly synthesized IκBα (5Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). To test whether this protection mechanism is regulated specifically by PEST-directed phosphorylation events, lysates were prepared from A293T cells after cotransfection with expression vectors for p50 and RelA. In parallel, we prepared lysates enriched for either wild type IκBα or a phosphorylation-defective mutant of IκBβ that formed ternary complexes with NF-κB and DNA (Mu-3; Figs. 1 A and2 A). Extracts containing NF-κB were incubated with a photoreactive κB-pd probe in the presence of Mu-3, and the resultant nucleoprotein complexes were cross-linked and immunoprecipitated with RelA-specific antiserum. As shown in Fig. 2 B, radiolabeled RelA-DNA adducts were readily detected in IκBα-deficient reactions (Fig. 2 B, lane 1, top panel). The addition of IκBα to these reaction mixtures failed to disrupt the DNA binding function of NF-κB when associated with Mu-3 (Fig.2 B, lanes 2–5, top panel). In contrast, IκBα potently inhibited NF-κB DNA binding activity in control reaction mixtures lacking Mu-3 (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2–5, bottom panel), which confirmed the integrity of IκBα preparations used in these studies. As such, ternary complexes containing this phosphorylation-defective PEST mutant of IκBβ are resistant to dissociation by IκBα, a property consistent with that proposed for hypophosphorylated IκBβ in vivo (5Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). In addition to its capacity to bind DNA, the RelA subunit of NF-κB contains a C-terminal transactivation domain (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Although the data shown in Fig. 2 A demonstrate that complexes containing NF-κB and phosphorylation-defective forms of IκBβ bind target DNA in vitro, the in vivo activity of NF-κB in the presence of these PEST mutants remained untested. To address this critical issue, A293T cells were cotransfected with a CAT reporter plasmid driven by two κB enhancer elements along with expression vectors for p50, RelA, and IκBβ. Under our overexpression conditions, NF-κB stimulated reporter gene activity ∼35-fold over basal levels in control transfectants lacking ectopic IκB. As shown in Fig. 3 A, wild type IκBβ completely blocked the transactivation function of NF-κB. Similar results were obtained with a PEST mutant harboring phosphoserine mimetics in place of Ser-313/Ser-315 (Mu-2). In contrast, phosphorylation-defective mutants of IκBβ that formed ternary complexes with NF-κB and DNA in vitro failed to efficiently block NF-κB-dependent transcription in vivo. All of these functional results correlated strongly with the pattern of NF-κB DNA binding activity observed in gel shift experiments that were conducted with nuclear extracts from the same transfectants (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these in vivo data suggest that the functional fate of NF-κB when bound to IκBβ is critically dependent on the phosphorylation status of the IκBβ PEST domain. Recent studies have established that the PEST domain of IκBβ is basally phosphorylated on serines in vivo (14Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise role of this domain in the regulation of NF-κB activity remained unclear. One clue to its function emerged from experiments showing that bacterially expressed forms of IκBβ lacking these basal modifications associate with NF-κB but fail to prevent DNA binding (5Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, phosphatase treatment of purified IκBβ from mammalian cells results in the loss of NF-κB inhibitory activity (25Link E. Kerr L.D. Schreck R. Zabel U. Verma I. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 239-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, specific serine mutations within the PEST domain of IκBβ have been identified that disrupt its ability to associate efficiently with c-Rel, another member of the NF-κB family of transcription factors (14Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present report provides strong evidence that the PEST domain of IκBβ controls whether NF-κB/IκBβ complexes are either latent or competent for transcription. We have found that serines clustered within the IκBβ PEST domain are phosphorylated via a cooperative mechanism involving requisite modifications at Ser-313 and Ser-315. In keeping with the behavior of wild type IκBβ, mutants defective for phosphorylation at these two residues associate stably with NF-κB. In sharp contrast to the wild type inhibitor, these PEST mutants fail not only to prevent NF-κB DNA binding in vitro but also to terminate NF-κB-directed transcription in vivo. This functional defect is completely rescued by replacing the disrupted PEST sites with a phosphoserine mimetic. We conclude that basal phosphorylation of Ser-313 and Ser-315 of IκBβ is required for the formation of latent NF-κB/IκBβ complexes. However, phosphoryl group transfer to additional serines within this region of the PEST domain (Fig. 1 A) is necessary to generate the fully functional inhibitor. Unlike IκBβ, IκBα is encoded by an NF-κB-responsive gene (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). This interplay normally provides a feedback mechanism to ensure the transient action of NF-κB. In this regard, Suyang et al.(5Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently identified a hypophosphorylated form of IκBβ in untransfected lymphocytes and proposed that this species contributes to the chronic activation of NF-κB under certain stimulatory conditions. In support of their proposal, in vitro mixing experiments with bacterially expressed proteins showed that recombinant IκBβ associates efficiently with NF-κB and shields it from neutralization by IκBα (5Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these prior studies did not define the sequences in endogenous IκBβ that mediate this protective function. In the present work, we identified phosphorylation-defective PEST mutants with properties that closely mimic this unusual functional phenotype. As determined with IκB proteins from mammalian cells, mutants defective for phosphorylation at Ser-313 and Ser-315 form stable ternary complexes with NF-κB and target DNA that are resistant to dissociation by IκBα in vitro. These results highlight a potential regulatory role for the IκBβ PEST domain in the repression of NF-κB-directed transcription by IκBα. Further resolution of this issue awaits insights into the phosphorylation status of the PEST domain of IκBβ during a transientversus persistent NF-κB response.

https://openalex.org/W2072945073,"Activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in nucleated cells is dependent on both growth factor receptors and integrins engaged in cell adhesion. Human platelets are an interesting model for studying cell adhesion and the involvement of integrin engagement on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, independently from the nuclear-DNA signal pathway. Maximal phosphorylation and activity of ERK2 occurred late during thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (90 s and later), an αIIbβ3 integrin-dependent event. Surprisingly, αIIbβ3 inhibition by the RGDS ligand peptide, or (Fab′)2 fragments of the AP-2 monoclonal antibody, resulted in a 2-fold enhancement in ERK2 phosphorylation and activity. A similar 2-fold enhancement of ERK2 activation was observed in thrombasthenic platelets which are defective in αIIbβ3 and do not aggregate. This suggests that ERK2 activation in thrombin-induced platelet aggregation is dependent on thrombin rather than on αIIbβ3 and is down-regulated by αIIbβ3 engaged in ligand (fibrinogen) binding and/or aggregation. Finally, in the absence of stirring which allows fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 but prevents aggregation, ERK2 was again overactivated. This overactivation appears to be consecutive to inhibition of aggregation itself and to αIIbβ3 ligand binding. We conclude that in platelets, αIIbβ3 engaged in aggregation down-regulates thrombin-induced ERK2 activation.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are a family of serine-threonine kinases activated by many extracellular stimuli including growth factors and hormones. They mediate intracellular phosphorylation events and regulate gene expression by transcription factors which drive cell proliferation (1Cobb M.H. Boulton T.G. Robbins D.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The first members of this family to be discovered in mammalian cells, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) are essential for cell proliferation (2Lenormand P. Pagès G. Sardet G. L'Allemain G. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 28: 237-244PubMed Google Scholar) and differentiation (3Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Recently, novel subgroups of the MAP kinase family, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase family (JNK), and p38 MAP kinase were identified (4Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar, 5Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar). To become active, ERK requires phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine residues in a Thr-X-Tyr motif (6Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J-H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). This dual phosphorylation is mediated by specific activators called MAP kinase kinase (MEK-1/2) (7Ashworth A. Nakeilny S. Cohen P. Marshall C. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2555-2556PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that integrin-mediated cell adhesion strongly activates ERKs (8Chen Q. Kinch S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During adhesion, ERK activation is induced sequentially first by mitogens and then by cell matrix interaction during G1 cell cycle progression (9Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This activation has been demonstrated when cells adhere to substrata coated with the adhesive proteins fibronectin, laminin, or RGD-containing peptides (8Chen Q. Kinch S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y.

Unlike growth factors, integrin-mediated ERK activation is dependent on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton (10Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T.

Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Moreover, ERK activation caused by integrin ligation is dependent on activation of MEK and Raf, but the relationship between ERK activation and Ras is unclear (12Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Platelets, which are terminally differentiated and anucleated cells, are an attractive model to study coupling between cell adhesion and ERK activation, independent of nuclear DNA-dependent pathways. Recent studies have identified two forms of ERK, p42ERK2and p44ERK1, in sheep and human platelets stimulated by thrombin (13Samiei M. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Borsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The ERK signal pathway in platelets remains largely uncharacterized. The activation of ERKs by different agonists seems to involve MEK through protein kinase C-dependent and -independent pathways (15Aharonovitz O. Granot Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16494-16499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Platelets possess a number of adhesive receptors (16Williams M.J. Du X. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), including integrin αIIbβ3 (GPIIb-IIIa), the receptor of fibrinogen, involved in platelet to platelet adhesion or aggregation. Engagement of αIIbβ3 in aggregation following fibrinogen binding and clustering triggers cytoskeletal rearrangement and activation of tyrosine kinases (17Shattil S, J. Haimovich B. Cunningham M.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3117-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As early events in integrin-mediated signaling involve the ERK cascade in proliferative cells, we examined the contribution of αIIbβ3 integrin to the activation of ERK2 during platelet aggregation. Interestingly, αIIbβ3 down-regulated ERK2 activation when engaged in fibrinogen-mediated platelet to platelet adhesion or aggregation. This observation contrasts with studies in other cell systems which describe integrin-mediated adhesion as being linked to activation of the MAPK pathway. Bovine thrombin, synthetic peptides Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS), Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser (RGES), leupeptin, aprotinin, and myelin basic protein were from Sigma. Protein G-Plus-agarose and rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a C-terminal peptide of ERK2 (C-14) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse monoclonal antibody raised only against the phosphorylated form of ERK2 (ERK2-P) was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). [γ-32P]ATP (167 TBq/mmol) was from ICN (Irvine, CA). (Fab′)2 fragments of the mouse monoclonal IgG AP-2 specific for αIIbβ3 were an extremely generous gift from Dr. T. J. Kunicki (19Pidard D. Montgomery R.R. Bennet J.S. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12582-12586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia studied herein have been described previously (20Djaffar I. Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 2183-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Chen Y.P. Djaffar I. Pidard D. Steiner B. Cieutat A-M. Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10169-10173Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). They are characterized by an absence of platelet aggregation and total absence of fibrinogen binding. Normal donors and thrombasthenic patients had not received any drug during the 2 weeks before blood donation. Venous blood was obtained from both healthy donors and patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia with their informed consent. The platelets were isolated and washed by differential centrifugation in citrate buffer, pH 6, containing 10−4 mm prostaglandin E1, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 12 mm trisodium citrate, 10 mm glucose, and 12.5 mm sucrose and then in the same buffer without prostaglandin E1. The platelet pellet was resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mmKCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmNaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose. The cell concentration was adjusted to 5 × 108/ml. Platelet aggregation was initiated by the addition of bovine thrombin with constant stirring (1,200 rpm) in an aggregometer cuvette (Chronolog dual beam aggregometer). Aggregation was measured and is expressed as a percent change in the transmission of light, with the blank sample (buffer without platelets) defined as 100%. Samples were subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (22Papkoff J. Chen R-H. Blenis J. Forsman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 463-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and then filters were incubated with the polyclonal primary antibody anti-ERK2 (1:10,000) or a monoclonal antibody anti-ERK2-P (1:1,000). After 5 washings, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) or anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the Amersham ECL enhanced chemiluminescence system. Platelet lysates were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with anti-ERK2 antibody (0.2 μg/sample), then further incubated with Protein G-Plus-agarose (30 μl, v/v) for 1 h at 4 °C for kinase activity (23Berrou E. Fontenay-Roupie M. Quarck R. Lévy-Toledano S. Tobelem G. Bryckaert M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and autoradiographed. To examine the phosphorylation and activity of ERK2 during platelet activation, we determined the conditions of thrombin-induced ERK2 activation by incubating platelets with increasing concentrations of thrombin (0–2 NIH units/ml) for 2 min under stirring. The state of phosphorylation, which correlates with a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of ERK2, was investigated by Western blotting using one antibody specific for ERK2, whether phosphorylated or not, and another antibody which recognized only phosphorylated ERK2 (ERK2-P). In resting platelets and after induction with thrombin (0.02–0.1 NIH units/ml), only nonphosphorylated ERK2 was detectable (Fig. 1 A). A retardation in ERK2 mobility, characteristic of ERK2-P, was detected after treatment with 0.2 NIH unit/ml thrombin and at higher concentrations. The identity of the low mobility ERK2 band was confirmed by reprobing the Western blot with an anti-ERK2-P antibody. No detectable band was visible in resting platelets or when platelets were stimulated with thrombin between 0 and 0.1 NIH units/ml. ERK2-P was detected at 0.2 NIH unit/ml of thrombin at 60% platelet aggregation and reached maximum intensity at 1 NIH unit/ml. Scanning densitometry indicated that 30% of total ERK2 was ERK2-P following thrombin treatment. We tested ERK2 kinase activity under the same thrombin conditions after ERK2 immunoprecipitation, by in vitro phosphorylation of MBP as substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”). No MBP phosphorylation was observed in resting platelets or when platelets were stimulated with between 0.02 and 0.1 NIH units/ml of thrombin. In contrast, a significant increase in ERK2 activity was detectable with 0.2 NIH unit/ml of thrombin and reached a maximum at 1 NIH unit/ml of thrombin. Therefore, there was a direct correlation between electrophoretic mobility, phosphorylation, and ERK2 activity. A thrombin concentration as low as 0.02 NIH unit/ml resulted in detectable platelet aggregation but not ERK2 activation suggesting that ERK2 activation is not required to initiate platelet aggregation. We next used gel mobility shift assay and kinase assay to investigate the time course of ERK2 activation upon treatment with 1 NIH unit/ml of thrombin (Fig. 1 B). In resting platelets and platelets stimulated with thrombin for 30 s, only the nonphosphorylated form of ERK2 was detected, and there was no ERK2 activity. In contrast, ERK2 phosphorylation and activity were detected after 60 s of induction, when platelet aggregation was about 34%, reached maximum between 150 and 180 s, and then decreased. Thus ERK2 activation is a late event in thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. One interpretation consistent with these results is that ERK2 activation is dependent on αIIbβ3integrin-dependent platelet to platelet adhesion or aggregation. Alternatively, ERK2 activation may be dependent on thrombin platelet stimulation. These two interpretations are not mutually exclusive. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we investigated thrombin-induced ERK2 activation conditions of inhibition of fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3 and inhibition of aggregation. The involvement of αIIbβ3 in ERK2 activation was assessed first by use of the RGDS peptide, a competitive inhibitor of fibrinogen for binding to αIIbβ3. In resting platelets, preincubation with RGDS alone in the absence of thrombin did not activate ERK2 (Fig.2 A). In thrombin-activated platelets, however, preincubation with RGDS for 30 s (0.5 and 1 mm), which completely inhibited platelet aggregation, did not prevent but instead enhanced ERK2 phosphorylation and activity after 2 min of thrombin activation (Fig. 2 A). Quantification by densitometry demonstrated a 202.3 ± 20.1% increase (p = 0.0002) in ERK2 phosphorylation and a 321.2 ± 50.3% increase (p = 0.01) in activity in the presence of 1 mm RGDS. A control RGES peptide, which did not block platelet aggregation, did not modify the thrombin-induced phosphorylation or activity of ERK2. To confirm these results, we blocked fibrinogen binding using (Fab′)2 fragments of the anti-αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibody AP-2 preincubated for 5 min before thrombin addition (19Pidard D. Montgomery R.R. Bennet J.S. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12582-12586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin-induced ERK2 phosphorylation and activity were increased dose dependently by AP-2 (Fab′)2, reaching a plateau at 10 μg/ml (Fig.2 B). At this concentration (10 μg/ml), the values obtained were comparable with those obtained with RGDS: 240.0% ± 63.4% (p = 0.02) ERK2 phosphorylation and 245.0 ± 75.6% (p = 0.02) ERK2 activity. Thus both experiments (RGDS and (Fab)′2 fragments) suggest that activation of the ERK2 pathway is not dependent on aggregation and is up-regulated when fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 is inhibited. We next investigated ERK2 activation in platelets from two Glanzmann thrombasthenia patients which are characterized by absence of aggregation due to quantitative or qualitative defects in αIIbβ3. Platelets from patients I and II had 2-fold higher ERK2 activities than control platelets (Fig.3). The enhancement in ERK activation (patient I, 190%; patient II, 240%) was thus similar whether αIIbβ3 was absent (patient I) or nonfunctional (patient II) or fibrinogen binding was competitively inhibited (by RGDS peptide or AP-2 (Fab′)2). This confirms that the absence of αIIbβ3 integrin engagement up-regulates ERK2 activation and that ERK2 activation is independent of platelet aggregation. All conditions used so far prevented or led to the absence of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 and consequently to the absence of aggregation. To distinguish between fibrinogen binding and aggregation itself, we compared ERK2 overactivation in unstirred (fibrinogen-bound, no aggregation) and stirred (fibrinogen-bound and aggregation) thrombin-activated platelets. The RGDS peptide was used as a negative control for fibrinogen binding. As illustrated in Fig.4, in unstirred platelets which prevent aggregation but allow fibrinogen binding, ERK2 activation was higher than in stirred thrombin-activated platelets. In control platelets, absence of stirring induced ERK2 overactivation, 181% and 182% at 2 and 3 min of thrombin stimulation. Since platelets did not aggregate in these conditions, this suggests that events precluding aggregation and that include fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3and subsequent clustering may participate in ERK2 overactivation. However maximal ERK2 overactivation reached 254% and 202% at 2 and 3 min, respectively, in the presence of RGDS in both stirred and unstirred platelets. Thus both platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 (and/or clustering) appear to negatively control thrombin-induced ERK2 activation. Aggregation is a complex phenomenon consecutive to fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 integrin and cytoskeletal rearrangements (24Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the course of platelet to platelet adhesion. It is possible that the partial negative control of thrombin-activated ERK2 is due to inhibition of upstream effectors of ERK or activation of phosphatases. Several kinases that act upstream from ERK have been identified in platelets. MEK can directly phosphorylate and activate ERK1 and ERK2 (15Aharonovitz O. Granot Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16494-16499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). MEK can be stimulated by Raf-1, a serine/threonine kinase which is also present in platelets (25White G.C. Fisher T.H. Grandall R. Eads L.E. Duffy C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73 (abstr.): 995Google Scholar). In the case of a role of phosphatases, the threonine/tyrosine phosphatases that are responsible for ERK dephosphorylation in proliferative cells have not been described in platelets (26Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 27Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The absence or presence of these phosphatases does not exclude the possibility that serine/threonine phosphatases, for example PP1 and PP2A (29Toyoda H. Nakai K. Omay S.B. Shima H. Nagao M. Shiku H. Nishikawa M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), are involved in ERK2 inhibition. Similarly tyrosine phosphatases may be involved, for example SHP-1 (30Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Maclouf J. Caen J.P. Lévy-Toledano S. Chap H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which fails to associate with cytoskeleton upon thrombin stimulation of thrombasthenic platelets (31Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Maclouf J. Caen J.P. Lévy-Toledano S. Chap H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). ERK phosphorylation is the net result of a balance between kinases and phosphatases. It is possible that actin bundling consecutive to αIIbβ3 engagement leads to partitioning of one or several of these elements, leading to an alteration in the ERK2-P balance when absent. We are planning to test this possibility. Interestingly, Hughes et al. (32Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) have recently shown that activation of the Ras-Raf-1-dependent MAP kinase pathway by transfection of cells expressing activated chimeric mutants of αIIbβ3 with constitutively active Ras or Raf mutants led to suppression of integrin activation. Our observations are the mirror image of this work as we show down-regulation of MAP kinase pathway by an integrin. Taken together, the two observations are consistent with a two-way down-regulatory connection between the MAP kinase pathway and integrins. It remains to be established why the function of platelet αIIbβ3 is in opposition to that of other integrins studied in nucleated cells. A possibility is that αIIbβ3 and other integrins interact with the MAP kinase pathway in different ways. We believe this is unlikely because studies of nucleated cells transfected with αIIbβ3 demonstrate activation of the MAP kinase pathway via αIIbβ3 (32Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) in a manner similar to other integrins. Alternatively, this may be a specific effect of the megakaryocytic-platelet lineage. It may therefore be valuable to examine the relationship between αIIbβ3 and/or other integrin engagement and the MAP kinase activation in cells of the megakaryocytic lineage. A third possible explanation is that integrin signaling differs according to the physical state of the ligand, for example adhesion to a solid support-associated ligand leads to activation of tyrosine kinases different from those activated by interaction with the soluble form of the ligand (8Chen Q. Kinch S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 269-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A similar situation may exist for coupling integrins and the MAP kinase pathway; this may explain why integrin-mediated cell adhesion to an immobilized ligand activates the MAP kinase pathway, whereas platelet aggregation, a cell-to-cell adhesion process mediated by interaction of αIIbβ3 integrin with soluble fibrinogen triggers down-regulation of the MAP kinase pathway. In conclusion, this is the first report showing that integrin engagement down-regulates ERK activation, suggesting that integrin may regulate the MAP kinase pathway in various ways depending on the cell and function. We are grateful to Dr. T. J. Kunicki for the extremely generous gift of (Fab′)2 fragments of the mouse monoclonal IgG AP-2 specific for αIIbβ3 and Dr. E. Berrou and Dr. C. Launay-Longo for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2117384673,"The purine repressor, PurR, is the master regulatory protein of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. This dimeric transcription factor is activated to bind to cognate DNA operator sites by initially binding either of its physiologically relevant, high affinity corepressors, hypoxanthine (K d = 9.3 μm) or guanine (K d = 1.5 μm). Here, we report the 2.5-Å crystal structure of the PurR-guanine-purF operator ternary complex and complete the atomic description of 6-oxopurine-induced repression by PurR.

The former finding confirms the use of an identical allosteric DNA-binding mechanism whereby corepressor binding 40 Å from the DNA-binding domain juxtaposes the hinge regions of each monomer, thus favoring the formation and insertion of the critical minor groove-binding hinge helices. Strikingly, the higher binding affinity of guanine for PurR and the ability of PurR to discriminate against 2-oxopurines do not result from direct protein-ligand interactions, but rather from a water-mediated contact with the exocyclic N-2 of guanine, which dictates the presence of a donor group on the corepressor, and the better electrostatic complementarity of the guanine base and the corepressor-binding pocket.

The purine repressor, PurR, is a 341-amino acid residue, dimeric DNA-binding protein from Escherichia coli. In E. coli, PurR functions as the master regulatory protein for de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis and, to a lesser extent,de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis and salvage, by repressing transcription of over 18 genes (1Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, PurR regulates the transcription of several genes encoding proteins necessary for polyamine and nucleotide biosynthesis (2Steiert J.G. Rolfes R. Zalkin H. Stauffer G.V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3799-3803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3He B. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3598-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, PurR is autoregulated (4Rolfes R.J. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5758-5766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Meng L. Kilstrup M. Nygaard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PurR belongs to the highly homologous lactose repressor (LacI) family of transcription regulators (6Weickert M.J. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15869-15874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ngyuen C.C. Saier Jr., M.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Nearly all LacI members function by binding to similar pseudo-palindromic operator sites typically 16–18 base pairs long. Structurally, LacI members can be divided into two functional domains: an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (∼60 residues) and a C-terminal oligomerization effector-binding domain (>250 residues). Effector binding serves as a signal of the metabolic state of the cell, and whereas most LacI proteins bind with high affinity to their operator sites only in the absence of effector binding, the specific interaction of PurR with its DNA operator sites is dependent on corepressor binding. PurR is unique in having two physiologically relevant corepressors, hypoxanthine, to which it binds with aK d of 9.3 μm, and guanine, to which it binds with higher affinity (K d = 1.5 μm) (8Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6207-6214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To describe the interactions between PurR and its corepressors and operator sites, we determined the structure of a PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The structure revealed that PurR has a bipartite structure: a C-terminal corepressor-binding domain (CBD), 1The abbreviations used are: CBD, corepressor-binding domain; Wat, water. which spans residues 61–341 and is responsible for dimerization and corepressor binding and specificity, and an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, which spans residues 1–60. The latter domain is composed of a classical helix-turn-helix motif that is closed off by a loop and another helix. By engaging in a series of direct and water-mediated contacts, this three-helix bundle provides the major groove binding specificity of PurR. It is followed by another loop and a fourth helix, the hinge helix. The hinge helix, with a 2-fold related mate, inserts into the DNA minor groove and makes additional specific contacts. Furthermore, hinge helix insertion kinks the purF operator by permitting the interdigitation of the side chains of Leu54 (and its 2-fold mate, Leu54′) between the central CpG base pair step of the operator (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The CBD is oblate in shape and consists of two topologically similar α/β-subdomains (the N- and C-terminal subdomains) that are connected by three crossover connections. The CBD is structurally similar to the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (10Müller-Hill B. Nature. 1983; 302: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Bowie J.V. Lüthy R. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 253: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar, 12Quiocho F.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 922-933Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As observed in the periplasmic binding proteins, PurR binds hypoxanthine in the cleft between the CBD subdomains through a series of polar, nonpolar, and aromatic interactions (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Direct and water-mediated contacts are provided by the side chains of Tyr73, Phe74, Arg190, Thr192, Phe221, and Asp275. The ability of PurR to utilize hypoxanthine or guanine, but not adenine and xanthine, indicates the critical importance of the chemical nature of the exocyclic 2- and 6-groups in binding specificity. The key PurR residue that specifies an oxygen at the purine exocyclic 6-position is Arg190. The guanidinium group of Arg190 donates two hydrogen bonds to the O-6 acceptor of hypoxanthine (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Thus, the side chain donors of Arg190 dictate the requirement for hydrogen bond acceptors at this purine position. However, the mechanism of discrimination at the exocyclic 2-group was unclear, as was the stereochemical basis by which PurR binds guanine more tightly than hypoxanthine (8Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6207-6214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To begin the structural elucidation of the allosteric mechanism of PurR, which transduces the signal of corepressor binding by the CBD to effect DNA binding by the distal DNA-binding domain, the structure of the corepressor-free CBD was determined (13Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). From this and the hypoxanthine-bound PurR structure, the role of that purine corepressor binding was discerned. Upon binding hypoxanthine, there is a dramatic rearrangement in the tertiary and quaternary structures of the CBD N-terminal subdomain that results in the juxtaposition of the two hinge regions of PurR, which are over 40 Å away (13Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Corepressor binding is essential for this juxtaposition as it shifts the equilibrium from the open form of PurR, in which the N- and C-terminal subdomains of the CBD are rotated far apart, to the closed conformation. Although likely, it was not known if guanine binding causes the identical structural changes that result in this allosteric shift. To address the issues of the corepressor specificity and the higher affinity of PurR for guanine and its possible consequences on the intramolecular signaling pathway and allostery of this protein, we have determined the structure of a PurR-guanine-purF operator complex at 2.5-Å resolution. As expected, the PurR-purFoperator contacts and DNA bending are nearly identical to those seen in the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the structure reveals that the higher affinity of guanine for PurR (over hypoxanthine) and the discrimination against xanthine as a corepressor arise from 1) a corepressor–water–protein hydrogen bonding network, which involves the exocyclic N-2 hydrogen bond donor of guanine and the hydrogen bond acceptors, O-ε of Glu222and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Phe221, and 2) the intrinsic negative electrostatic environment of the corepressor-binding pocket, which favors the more positive guanine as the corepressor. PurR was overexpressed in E. coli and purified by DE53 cellulose and heparin-agarose chromatography as described (14Rolfes R. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5637-5642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystals of the PurR-guanine-purF operator complex were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, which was used previously to crystallize the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex (15Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein at a concentration of 0.25–0.50 mm was saturated with guanine and mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a 0.50 mm solution of the 16-base pair purF operator, which has an additional 5′-nucleoside overhang on both strands, the identity of which is irrelevant to crystallization. The protein/corepressor/DNA solution was mixed 1:1 with the reservoir solution, which was 25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.40 m ammonium sulfate, 25 mmhexamminecobalt chloride, and 0.10 m ammonium phosphate, pH 7.5. Crystals initially grow as thin two-dimensional plates and, within a period of 2 weeks to several months, melt and are replaced by large rhombohedral crystals (typically 0.6 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm). The PurR-guanine-purF operator crystals are isomorphous to the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator crystals and take the space group C2221, with unit cell dimensions of a= 176.0, b = 95.08, and c = 81.51 Å. There is one PurR monomer, one guanine molecule, and a purFoperator half-site in the asymmetric unit. X-ray intensity data were collected at room temperature with an Area Detector Systems Corp. multiwire area detector (16Xuong N. Nielsen C. Hamlin R. Andersen D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1985; 18: 342-350Crossref Google Scholar) and a Rigaku RU200-H rotating anode operating at 40 kV and 150 mA. The data from two crystals were processed and merged with the software provided by Area Detector Systems Corp. The R merge of the data to 2.5 Å is 6.29%, and the data are 87% complete from 10.0 to 2.5 Å and 78% from 2.7 to 2.5 Å. The redundancy of the data is 3-fold. TheI/ς(I) is 7.4 for the entire data set and 1.4 for the data in the resolution shell between 2.7 and 2.5 Å. The previously determined structure of the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex minus the hypoxanthine and solvent molecules was used as the starting model for refinement (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement was carried out on the model followed by XYZ and B factor refinement as implemented in TNT (17Tronrud D.E. TenEyck L.J. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 498-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The current model, refined from 10.0 to 2.5 Å, has an R factor of 18.0% and displays excellent stereochemistry with only two residues, Ser124 and Asp275 in the unfavorable region of the Ramachandran plot (18Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). As observed previously, the unfavorable φ/ψ angles of Asp275 are necessary for its interaction with the N-9 atom of the corepressor (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Although not directly in contact with the corepressor, Ser124 is located directly above the corepressor-binding pocket and takes this conformation to avoid steric clash with the side chain of Arg190. 2M. A. Schumacher and R. G. Brennan, unpublished data. The root mean square deviations of bond lengths and bond angles are 0.02 Å and 2.23°, respectively. An F o −F c omit map, in which the guanine base, residues 221–222, and Wat1 were omitted from the model and followed by 20 cycles of positional and thermal parameter refinement, is shown in Fig. 1 (17Tronrud D.E. TenEyck L.J. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 498-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The current model of the PurR-guanine-purF operator complex includes residues 3–340 of the PurR monomer, one guanine molecule, a purF operator half-site, and 20 solvent molecules (Fig. 2). The atomic structures of PurR and the purF operator are essentially identical to those seen in the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex and display a root mean square deviation of 0.25 Å for all atoms except solvent (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Therefore, guanine and hypoxanthine induce the same DNA binding conformation of PurR. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain (residues 3–60) consists of a helix-turn-helix-loop-helix motif, which is responsible for DNA major groove binding specificity, and a hinge helix, which binds, with its 2-fold related mate, in the minor groove of the DNA. The insertion of two α-helices into the narrow minor groove is made possible by the partial interdigitation of the hinge helix residue Leu54 (and Leu54′) within the central CpG base pair step. DNA bending, which was calculated with CURVES (19Lavory R. Sklenar H. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1990; 6: 215-235Google Scholar) and was exclusive of the first and last base pairs of the 16-base pair operator because of their poor electron density, revealed a 55° kink in the PurR-guanine-purF operator complex resulting from this side chain partial insertion. This bend is essentially identical to the 54° bend observed in the structure of the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G.

The CBD consists of two subdomains: the CBD N-terminal subdomain, which consists of a core of six β-strands (βA–βE and βJ) surrounded by four α-helices (I–III and IX), and the CBD C-terminal subdomain, which consists of a core of five β-strands (βF–βI and βK) surrounded by five α-helices (IV–VIII) (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Three crossover peptides connect the two subdomains and serve as a floor to the corepressor, which is bound in the cleft between the two CBD subdomains. As seen in the periplasmic binding proteins, these peptidic linkages act as a hinge to allow movements of subdomains upon ligand association and dissociation (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 10Müller-Hill B. Nature. 1983; 302: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Bowie J.V. Lüthy R.

All contacts observed between PurR and the corepressor hypoxanthine in the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex are also present in the PurR-guanine-purF operator complex. Stacking interactions occur between guanine and the side chains of Tyr73 and Phe221, which sandwich the corepressor, and Phe74. Hydrogen bonds are provided by Thr192, Asp275, and Arg190. O-γ of Thr192 hydrogen bonds with N-7 of the guanine ring (2.73 Å, O-γ–N-7) and also makes van der Waals contact with the corepressor C-8 via its side chain methyl group. Asp275makes a hydrogen bond with N-9 of the purine (2.92 Å, O-δ2–N-9). The importance of Arg190 in corepressor binding specificity at the exocyclic 6-position was revealed in the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In the PurR-guanine-purF operator complex, Arg190 also specifies an oxygen at the exocyclic 6-position by providing two hydrogen bonds to this exocyclic amine from its side chain N-ζ and NH-1 atoms (3.03 Å, N-ζ–O-6; and 2.72 Å, NH-1–O-6). Arg190 contributes further to corepressor binding affinity by hydrogen bonding to a water molecule that is simultaneously hydrogen-bonded to N-1 of the guanine ring (3.15 Å, H2O–N-1; and 2.72 Å, H2O–NH2). The essentially identical binding observed between PurR and hypoxanthine and guanine in the PurR-hypoxanthine-purFoperator and PurR-guanine-purF operator complexes and the identical corepressor-mediated conformations of both complexes reveal how PurR utilizes two related molecules as corepressors. However, these interactions do not explain the nearly 7-fold higher affinity of guanine for PurR or the mechanism by which PurR discriminates at the purine exocyclic 2-position, i.e. against xanthine. On the basis of the location of the side chain of Glu222 in the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complex (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), we anticipated that upon guanine binding by PurR, this side chain would swing into the corepressor-binding pocket, eject a tightly bound water molecule (Wat-1), and make a direct hydrogen bond with the exocyclic N-2 atom. However, in the PurR-guanine-purF operator complex, the position of the side chain of Glu222 has changed little, and the water molecule is still present, although slightly shifted in position (Fig. 1). Rather, now the water molecule is positioned perfectly to hydrogen bond to the exocyclic N-2 of the guanine ring (2.91 Å, H2O–N-2). This interaction is specific and discriminatory as both hydrogen bond donors of the water molecule are taken: one by the carbonyl oxygen atom of Phe221 (3.10 Å, H2O–O) and the other by O-ε1 of Glu222 (3.06 Å, H2O–O-ε1) (Fig.1). This leaves only the two acceptor lone pairs of this water molecule, one of which interacts with the guanine N-2 atom and presumably the other with a hydrogen bond donor from the bulk solvent. Such a hydrogen bonding network would disfavor the binding of xanthine, which has an exocyclic acceptor atom (O-2) at this position. Consistent with this hypothesis is the in vitro binding of xanthine to PurR, which is ∼200-fold weaker than guanine binding (data not shown). Remarkably, this water molecule is found not only in the PurR-guanine-purF operator and the PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator complexes, but also in the corepressor-free form of PurR, where the identical water–protein hydrogen bonds are made (13Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that this tightly bound water molecule acts as an extension of the protein. The importance of water-mediated contacts in ligand binding specificity is now well documented. Notable examples include members of the periplasmic binding protein family such as the arabinose-binding protein (21Quiocho F.A. Wilson D.A. Vyas N.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 22Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4769-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and oligopeptide-binding protein (OppA) (24Tame J.R.H. Sleigh S.H. Wilkinson A.J. Ladbury J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); enzymes, e.g.α-chymotrypsin (25Fujinaga M. Sielecki A.P. Read R.J. Ardelt W. Laskowski M. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 397-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar); and DNA-binding proteins as exemplified in the TrpR-tryptophan-trp operator complex (26Otwinowski Z. Schevitz R.W. Zhang R.-G.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the arabinose-binding protein, two hydrogen-bonded water molecules, located in the binding pocket, aid in l-arabinose binding while creating an unfavorable interaction with the C-5 methyl group ofd-fucose, thus explaining the low affinity of the latter. The near equal affinity of the arabinose-binding protein ford-galactose is explained by the replacement of one of these water molecules with the d-galactose -CH2OH group (21Quiocho F.A. Wilson D.A. Vyas N.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 22Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5226-5237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar situation is observed in the lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding protein, where water molecules assist in the binding of lysine, ornithine, and arginine. However, one of the water molecules must be displaced to permit binding of the larger arginine ligand (23Yao N. Trakhanov S. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4769-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, OppA provides an example of the use of solvent in decreasing ligand binding specificity through the accommodation of multiple substrates with different peptide side chains in voluminous hydrated cavities from which water molecules are readily gained or lost (24Tame J.R.H. Sleigh S.H. Wilkinson A.J. Ladbury J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the structure of α-chymotrypsin complexed with a turkey ovomucoid inhibitor, it was demonstrated that a water molecule, also present in the apo structure, mediated an ionic interaction that was critical for inhibitor binding specificity (25Fujinaga M. Sielecki A.P. Read R.J. Ardelt W. Laskowski M. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 397-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Thus, as in the case of PurR, this water molecule can be considered as a constitutive element of the protein. Finally, the TrpR-tryptophantrp operator complex reveals quite dramatically the use of water molecules to nearly completely specify protein-DNA binding specificity (26Otwinowski Z. Schevitz R.W. Zhang R.-G. Lawson C.L. Joachimiak A. Marmorstein R.Q. Luisi B.F. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1988; 334: 321-329Crossref Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 27Joachimiak A. Haran T.E. Sigler P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, through its small molecular size, which allows it to pack around ligands of different size and shape, and its ability to provide hydrogen bond donors as well as acceptors, water provides a key element in the formation of a wide variety of protein-ligand complexes. In addition to the direct water-mediated discrimination against xanthine, an examination of the electrostatic potential of the PurR corepressor-binding pocket and its proximity reveals a second possible source of unfavorable xanthine binding as well as the chemical basis of the more favorable binding of guanine over hypoxanthine. PurR displays a negative electrostatic potential surface near the exocyclic 2-position of the guanine ring (Fig. 3). Glu220, Glu222, and Glu70 and Glu70′ from the other subunit contribute to the negative potential of the binding pocket of PurR. This surface is complemented by N-2 of guanine, which imparts a significant positive potential to this base. Hypoxanthine, which lacks any exocyclic group at the ring 2-position, is nearly neutral, but is still weakly positive. In contrast to the physiological corepressors, xanthine possesses a negative electrostatic potential at its exocyclic O-2 position, which likely contributes further to its very low affinity (Fig.4). A similar electrostatic complementarity is observed between the exocyclic N-2 atom of the guanine base of GDP and ARF-1 (28Greasley S.E. Jhoti H. Teahan C. Solari R. Fensome A. Thomas G.M.H. Cockcroft S. Bax B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), where the N-2 atom is enclosed in a positive pocket in the protein. This suggests that such electrostatic complementarity may play a significant role in purine-protein binding and recognition. In addition to the patch of negative electrostatic potential near the exocyclic 2-atom of guanine, there is another locus of negative potential within the corepressor-binding pocket, which is contributed by Glu248 and Asp275 and complements the positive potential of the N-9 atom of the purine rings of guanine and hypoxanthine (Fig. 4). Beyond its contribution to binding, the charged environment of PurR could serve to steer its guanine and hypoxanthine corepressors into their bound positions within the binding pocket. Indeed, electrostatic focusing by narrow clefts appears to be a general phenomenon, having been perhaps best documented for copper,zinc-superoxide dismutase (29Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nature. 1983; 306: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and trypsin (30Klapper I. Hagstrom R. Fine R. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Thus, a tight water-mediated hydrogen bond and the negative electrostatic potential of the corepressor-binding pocket, which complements guanine better than hypoxanthine, provide a thermodynamic rationale for the increased affinity of PurR for guanine over hypoxanthine while allowing PurR to maintain the same activated conformation for both corepressors. Combined, these interactions are consistent with the small favorable free energy change (ΔΔG ≈ −1 kcal/mol, as calculated by the relationship ΔΔG = −RTln(K dGua/K dHyp) observed for PurR-guanine binding over PurR-hypoxanthine binding.Figure 4Electrostatic potentials of guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine. The atomic charges and electrostatic potentials are mapped on the van der Waals surfaces of guanine (A), hypoxanthine (B), and xanthine (C) and were calculated with a 3–21G* basis set using Spartan software (Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, CA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PurR is unique in being the only repressor with two physiologically relevant corepressors to have had their three-dimensional structures as well as its corepressor-free form determined at atomic resolution (9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y.

Nature. 1989; 341: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 35Somers W.S. Phillips S.E.V. Nature. 1992; 359: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 36Phillips K. Phillips S.E.V. Structure. 1994; 2: 309-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The TrpR and MetJ repressors are similar in that they both bind their corepressors within their DNA-binding domains. In the case of TrpR, thel-tryptophan corepressor reorients the flexible DNA-binding helix-turn-helix reading heads to allow them to fit into successive major grooves. Moreover, the l-tryptophan makes direct contacts with the DNA phosphate backbone. For MetJ, the binding of its corepressor, S-adenosylmethionine, which is located ∼12 Å from the DNA backbone, does not appear to result in any conformational change or structural rearrangement of the MetJ protein (34Rafferty J.B. Somers W.S. Saint-Girons I. Phillips S.E.V. Nature. 1989; 341: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 35Somers W.S. Phillips S.E.V. Nature. 1992; 359: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Rather, the electrostatic potential of MetJ becomes decidedly more positive and might effect, albeit indirectly, the high affinity DNA binding (36Phillips K. Phillips S.E.V. Structure. 1994; 2: 309-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Clearly, PurR is different and binds its corepressors within a corepressor-binding pocket, which is at least 40 Å from the DNA-binding domain. Corepressor binding activates DNA binding allosterically by repositioning the hinge regions of each PurR monomer such that they may interact, undergo a coil-to-helix transition (37Spolar R.S. Record M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar,38Nagadoi A. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Enari M. Kobagashi K. Yamamoto H. Sampei G. Mizobuchi K. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Nishimura Y. Structure. 1995; 3: 1217-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and bind the DNA minor groove. In summary, the structure of the PurR-guanine-purF operator complex has established that binding of either hypoxanthine or guanine induces the same activated conformation of PurR, which can then bind the pur regulon operators with high affinity. The structure also reveals the likely basis for the higher affinity of PurR for its guanine corepressor versus hypoxanthine and the stereochemical mechanism of xanthine discrimination: 1) water-mediated readout of the exocyclic 2-position of the purine and 2) better protein-corepressor electrostatic complementarity, notably about the exocyclic 2-position of the purine ring."

(1991) BioEssays 13, 429–437). Exon 6, which encodes residues 189–213 in long, 284-residue tropomyosins, has two alternative forms, exon 6a or 6b, both highly conserved throughout evolution. In α-tropomyosin, exon 6a or 6b is not specific to any one of the nine isoforms. Exon 6b encodes part of a putative Ca2+-sensitive troponin binding site in striated muscle tropomyosins, suggesting that the exon 6-encoded region may be specialized for certain tropomyosin functions.A series of recombinant, unacetylated tropomyosin exon 6 deletion and substitution mutants and chimeras was expressed in Escherichia coli to determine the requirements of exon 6 for tropomyosin function. Functional properties of the tropomyosins were defined by actin affinity measured by cosedimentation, troponin T affinity using a newly developed biosensor assay, and regulation of the actomyosin MgATPase. The region of tropomyosin encoded by exon 6 affects actin affinity but not thin filament assembly, troponin T binding, or regulation with troponin. The tropomyosins with exon 6a or 6b function normally whether a striated muscle exon 9a or smooth/non-muscle exon 9d is present. However, the effect of deleting 21 amino acids encoded by exon 6 or replacing it with a GCN4 leucine zipper sequence depends on the COOH-terminal sequence.

Tropomyosins (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, tropomyosin; Tn, troponin; RU, response units; DTT, dithiothreitol; αH, Hill coefficient. are a family of highly conserved coiled-coil actin binding proteins present in most eukaryotic cells. At least 15 different isoforms arise through the use of alternative promoters and alternative RNA splicing of the transcripts of a small number of genes (three to four in vertebrates; reviewed in Ref. 1Lees-Miller J. Helfman D. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These isoforms are expressed in developmentally and tissue-specific patterns and differ in actin affinity. A function common to all TMs is cooperative binding to F-actin (2Yang Y. Korn E.D. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7137-7140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tropomyosin molecules are aligned head-to-tail in the grooves of the helical actin filament (3O'Brien E.J. Bennett P.M. Hanson J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol.

The role of TM is best understood in striated muscle where it regulates Ca2+-dependent muscle contraction with Tn (reviewed in Refs. 5Lehrer S.S. J. Muscle Res.

The elongated NH2 terminus of TnT extends beyond the COOH terminus of one TM to the NH2-terminal 10–30 residues of the next TM along the actin filament (13Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Lewis S.F. Mistrik M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 14Brisson J.R. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4548-4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Troponin greatly increases the affinity of TM for actin in the presence of Ca2+, with a further increase upon removal of Ca2+ (15Wegner A. Walsh T.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on binding studies with TM and Tn peptides, Mak and Smillie (16Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) proposed that the α-TM-Tn interaction in the region of Cys-190 is weakened in the presence of Ca2+ (Ca2+-sensitive), whereas that at the COOH terminus and the overlap region is strong in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (Ca2+-independent). Substantial evidence has since supported this model. The presence of tissue-specific alternatively expressed exons implies distinct functions for the regions of TM they encode. For example, of four exons in the α-TM gene encoding the COOH terminus (9a-9d), exon 9a, important for Tn interaction on the thin filament (17Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4236-4242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), is uniquely expressed in striated muscles. Of the two sixth exons, only exon 6b is expressed in striated α- and β-TMs, although it is not restricted to striated isoforms. The exon 6b-encoded region of striated muscle TM (residues 189–214) is part of the putative Ca2+-sensitive Tn binding site. To determine the requirements of the alternatively spliced exon 6 for TM function, we expressed a series of recombinant, unacetylated TM exon 6 deletion and substitution mutants and chimeras in Escherichia coli. Functional properties of the modified TMs were defined by actin affinity, TnT affinity, assembly with Tn on the thin filament, and regulation of the actomyosin MgATPase. We have shown that the region of TM encoded by exon 6 affects actin affinity but not TnT binding, assembly with Tn on the thin filament, or thin filament regulation. Portions of this work have been reported in a preliminary form (19Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 259sGoogle Scholar).

The nucleotides encoding 21 amino acid residues 191–211 were deleted from TM6b-9d resulting in TMΔ6-9d. These nucleotides were then replaced with residues 191–211 encoded by exon 6a, resulting in TM6a-9d.

Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar), resulting in TM6zip-9d.

The oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer, purified using an NENSORB cartridge, and phosphorylated enzymatically using phage T4 polynucleotide kinase (24Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 468-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The synthesis reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. Competent E. coli DH5a cells were transformed with a portion of the synthesis reaction, then plated for colony isolation. Single colonies were reisolated and then used for DNA preparation. The DNA was screened for mutants using restriction analysis. The complete cDNA sequence was determined using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with α-35S-dATP (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52649) Google Scholar). Chimeric TMs containing exon 9a were constructed by ligating theNcoI-SmaI fragment from pUC119/TMΔ6-9d or pUC119/TM6a-9d, containing all of the TM codons except for the codons 238–284, to the SmaI-BamHI fragment from pUC119/STTM containing TM codons 238–284, resulting in the chimeras pUC119/TMΔ6-9a and pUC119/TM6a-9a. TheNcoI-BamHI fragments of the cDNAs were cloned in the NcoI and BamHI sites of the pET11d expression vector and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (26Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). The TMs were purified from two liters of cells (yield = 20–30 mg/liter) as described previously (18Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) were purified from chicken pectoral muscle. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was carried out by Dr. N. J. Greenfield to measure the folding of TM as a function of temperature (31Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16797-16805Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The TM exon 6 variants showed multiple transitions with virtually the same degree of folding at 20 °C, with the exception of TMΔ6-9d which is only about 80% folded (Table I) (32Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16797-16805Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal 27 residues encoded by the striated muscle-specific exon 9a is associated with an increase of the overall thermal stability of TM, the magnitude depending on the exon 6 variant (Table I). In general, the differences can be understood in terms of changes in the hydrophobicity of the a and d residues of the heptad repeat that form the interface between the two α-helices of the coiled coil (32Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16797-16805Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Binding of TM to actin was measured by cosedimentation at 25 °C in a Beckman model TL-100 centrifuge as described previously (33Heald R.W. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5254-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications (34Urbancikova M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24310-24315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bound and free TM were determined by quantitative densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue (34Urbancikova M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24310-24315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparent binding constants (K app) and Hill coefficients (αH) were determined by using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) to fit the data to the equationv=n*TM*αH·KappαH/1=*TM*αH·KappαHEquation 1 The TM/actin ratio determined using densitometry (arbitrary units) was normalized using the n reported by SigmaPlot. We have shown that saturation corresponds to a TM:actin molar ratio of 0.14, a stoichiometry of 1 TM:7 A. A BIAcore (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) biosensor was used to measure binding of TM in solution to immobilized TnT. Chicken muscle TnT was dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT at 4 °C overnight prior to immobilization on a sensor chip CM5 in the BIAcore system using an amine coupling kit (Pharmacia, Biosensor). Thirty μl of TnT diluted to 0.33 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 8.5, 300 mm NaCl, were immobilized on the carboxylated matrix of a sensor chip activated by a 20-μl injection of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. Excess reactive groups were blocked with a 30-μl injection of ethanolamine hydrochloride. Assays were carried out at 25 °C in a 5 μl/min flow of buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT). The density of TnT immobilized on the surface measured 3358 response units (RU) for the exon 6 variants and 2652 RU for the exon 9 variants, corresponding to 12–15 ng/mm2. Based on the RU when TM binds, the 1:1 stoichiometry of TM:Tn, and knowing that the surface plasmon resonance response is proportional to the surface concentration of bound protein (35Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), approximately 30% of the surface was active. When striated muscle TM was repeatedly injected, with regeneration of the surface between injections, the amount of bound TM was reproducible to within a few percent (730 ± 13 RU). An analytical cycle consisted of initiation of the association phase at 120–260 s by injection of 20 μl of TM (0.5–12 μm) at 25 °C in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT at 5 μl/min across a surface of immobilized TnT. The dissociation phase was initiated at 360–380 s by switching to continuous flow of buffer without TM, and finally, regeneration of the surface with 10 μl of 2.5 m NaCl at 5 μl/min. BIAevaluation software (Pharmacia, Biosensor, version 2.1) was used for data processing. Dissociation rate constants (k d) were determined by fitting the dissociation data to the equation: Rt = R 0e−k d1(t−t 0)+(R 0−R 1)e−k d2(t−t 0)which calculates the dissociation rate of two parallel reactions, where R t is the relative response (RU) (representing TM bound to TnT) at time t; R 0 is the response at the start of dissociation;k d 1 is the dissociation rate constant (s−1) for the first phase of the biphasic curve;k d 2 is the dissociation rate constant (s−1) for the second phase of the biphasic curve;t 0 is the start time for dissociation. The part of the sensorgram usable for analysis is the most linear region of a plot of ln(abs(dY/dX)) versus time after the initial bulk refractive index “hump.” Generally,t 0 was about 10–20 s and t was about 160–240 s after the start of elution (indicated by the region between the solid vertical lines in Figs. 5 and 6). Association rate constants (k a) were calculated from the calculatedk t values at different TM concentrations according to the following association type one model: Rt = Req1(1 − e−k a1·C·nl+k d1(t−t 0)) +Req2(1 − e−k a2·C·n2+k d2(t−t 0 )), which calculates the association rate constantsk a 1 andk a 2 for a heterogenous interaction, Req is steady state, C is the molar concentration of TM;n is the steric interference factor. Generally,t 0 was about 10–15 s and t was about 130–185 s after injection of TM (indicated by the region between thebroken vertical lines in Figs. 5 and 6). Apparent binding constants (K app) were calculated by dividing the average k a (determined at different concentrations of each TM variant) by the average k d. Applying the tests recommended by Schuck and Minton (36Shuck P. Minton A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 458-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), our data are valid when evaluated using a two-site model.Figure 6Association and dissociation kinetics ofA, TMΔ6-9a; B, TM6a-9a; C, TM6zip-9a, D, TM9a; E, TM9a/9d with TnT covalently linked to CM-dextran through amino groups.

The amount of inorganic phosphate released was determined colorimetrically according to White (37White H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and the plates were read in a Molecular Devices ThermoMax microtiter plate reader with a 650-nm filter. Time courses had been carried out previously to show that phosphate liberation was linear. The assays were single point determinations. Protein concentration was calculated using the difference absorption spectrum at 295 nm as described previously (18Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4236-4242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) assuming a value ε295(Tyr) = 2480 m−1 cm−1 (38Lehrer S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The concentration of the TM used for the standard curve for densitometry was determined using a microbiuret assay (39Goa J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1953; 5: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) and confirmed using the above method. The concentration of actin, myosin, Tn, and TnT were determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients (1% at 280 nm) 11.0, 5.3, 4.5, and 5.0, respectively. The alternatively spliced exon 6 of TM encodes residues 189–214 in striated TMs and is part of the putative Ca2+-sensitive Tn binding site. To define the requirements of the exon 6-encoded region for TM function, we made three exon 6 variants by deleting or replacing exon 6b in smooth TM (TM6b-9d, Fig.1 A). 1) Residues 191–212 of exon 6b were deleted (TMΔ6-9d). Only 21 of the 25 residues were deleted to maintain the heptapeptad repeat of hydrophobic residues important for the stability of the coiled coil. The deletion corresponds to one-half an actin binding period, based on there being seven quasiequivalent periodic sites (40McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). 2) Residues 191–211 were replaced with the corresponding sequence from the alternative α-TM exon 6a (TM6a-9d). 3) The entire sixth exon, residues 189–213, was replaced with a non-TM coiled-coil sequence from the yeast transcriptional activator, GCN4 (TM6zip-9d) (23Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar). Residue 212 in the original GCN4 sequence was changed from Gly to Ala to assure an uninterrupted coiled coil. These three exon 6 variants were expressed in E. coli to produce unacetylated TMs with two different COOH-terminal exons: exon 9d, found in smooth and most non-muscle TMs (Fig. 1 A) and exon 9a, unique to striated TM (Fig.1 B). All of the exon 6 variants contain the unique smooth α-TM exon 2a. The actin affinity of the TM exon 6 variants was measured by cosedimentation (Fig. 2, TableII). TM6b-9d (smooth muscle α-TM) bound to actin with high affinity, as previously reported (17Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4236-4242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Replacing 21 residues of exon 6b with 6a (TM6a-9d) resulted in a 2-fold increase in actin affinity, consistent with previous results (41Pittenger M.F. Helfman D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 841-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Replacement of exon 6b with a GCN4 leucine zipper sequence (TM6zip-9d) or deletion of half an actin binding period (TMΔ6-9d) reduced the actin affinity so it could not be accurately measured. The effect of the leucine zipper replacement was surprising because the 284 residue length of the molecule and the coiled-coil α-helix were maintained.Table IIActin binding constants and Hill coefficients of tropomyosin exon 6 variantsTropomyosinNo troponinTroponin + Ca2+Troponin + EGTAK appHill coefficientK appHill coefficientK appHill coefficientm −1m −1m −1TM6b-9d4.6 ± 0.2 × 1063.7 ± 0.57.7 ± 0.2 × 1062.9 ± 0.2>108NA2-aNA, not applicable.TMΔ6–9d<105NA<105NA≈105NATM6a-9d9.9 ± 0.3 × 1064.3 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.2 × 1074.0 ± 0.3>108NATM6zip-9d<105NA<105NA≈105NATMΔ6–9a≈106NA≈7 × 107≈4>108NATM6a-9a≈106NA≈7 × 107≈4>108NATM6zip-9a<105NA1.7 ± 0.1 × 1072.0 ± 0.3>108NAThe data from the binding isotherms in Figs. 2 and 3, A andB, were fit to the Hill equation.

Data are reported asK app and Hill coefficient ± the S.E. calculated using SigmaPlot. Note that all of the tropomyosin variants shown here contain the smooth-specific exon 2a. All of the exon 6 variants with an exon 9a-encoded COOH terminus bound weakly compared with TM6a-9d or TM6b-9d (Fig. 2, Table II), as does unacetylated striated α-TM (17Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4236-4242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, deletion of exon 6 had little effect while replacement with the GCN4 leucine zipper sequence significantly reduced actin affinity. It is unclear how the effect of deleting 21 residues depends on exon 9. If the region encoded by exon 6 contributes to the Tn binding site on TM, one might expect the TM exon 6 variants to differ significantly in the effect of Tn on thin filament assembly. Troponin in the presence of Ca2+ caused a ≈100-fold increase for all TM variants containing exon 9a (Fig.3 A), whereas it had only a small effect on the affinity of exon 9d-containing TMs, except TM6zip-9d and TMΔ6-9d which did not change (Fig. 3 B). The 4-fold lower actin affinity of TM6zip-9a compared with TM6a-9a was a similar effect to that reported for striated α-TM with GCN4 sequence inserted in the second or third periods of the molecule (42Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. An Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3600-3603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Removal of Ca2+ increased the affinity of all exon 9a- and 9d-encoded variants, independent of exon 6 identity (Fig. 3,A and B, and Table II). To measure accurately the actin affinities in the absence of Ca2+, the NaCl concentration was increased from 150 to 300 mm to weaken actin affinity (Fig.4). Together the results in Figs. 2, 3, 4and Table II show that the relationship of the different exon 6 variants in terms of actin affinity remained constant with Tn in the presence and absence of Ca2+, as well as in the absence of Tn. Clearly, alterations in exon 6, or deletion of exon 6, primarily affect actin affinity, not Tn interaction on the thin filament. The results are consistent with previous reports showing the importance of exon 9 on Tn-enhanced TM affinity for actin (17Cho Y.-J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4236-4242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). From the actin binding experiments, we can only infer the requirements of exon 6 for Tn interaction because Tn binds to both actin and TM. Existing methods used to evaluate TM-Tn interaction are qualitative or require covalent modification of TM (16Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 43Morris E.P. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2214-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 44Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6894-6903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we have developed a solid phase affinity assay employing biosensor technology to measure directly the binding of TM with TnT. In this assay, TnT was immobilized on a dextran matrix attached to a gold-coated sensor chip surface to detect binding of different TM variants in a flow chamber. The amount of TM which bound to the immobilized TnT was calculated from the surface plasmon resonance signal measured as a function of time (45Jonsson U. Malmqvist M. Turner A.P.F. Advances in Biosensors. JAI Press, London1992: 291-336Google Scholar). Using this technique, we have measured TnT binding of the exon 6 variants described here, as well as of a series of previously reported exon 9 variants (18Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4236-4242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Q"
https://openalex.org/W1643460169,"During prometaphase in mitotic cell division, chromosomes attach to the walls of microtubules and subsequently move to microtubule ends, where they stay throughout mitosis. This end-attachment seems to be essential for correct chromosome segregating. However, the mechanism by which kinetochores, the multiprotein complexes that link chromosomes to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle, recognize and stay attached to microtubule ends is not understood. One clue comes from the hydrolysis of GTP that occurs during microtubule polymerization. Although tubulin dimers must contain GTP to polymerize, this GTP is rapidly hydrolysed following the addition of dimers to a growing polymer. This creates a microtubule consisting largely of GDP-tubulin, with a small cap of GTP-tubulin at the end. It is possible that kinetochores distinguish the different structural states of a GTP- versus a GDP-microtubule lattice. We have examined this question in vitro using reconstituted kinetochores from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that kinetochores in vitro bind preferentially to GTP- rather than GDP-microtubules, and to the plus-end preferentially over the lattice. Our results could explain how kinetochores stay at microtubule ends and thus segregate chromosomes correctly during mitosis in vivo. This result demonstrates that proteins exist that can distinguish the GTP conformation of the microtubule lattice."
https://openalex.org/W2012734406,"Decreased levels of the nm23 gene product have been correlated with increased tumor metastatic potential in a variety of malignancies. At least a subset of the regulatory properties of Nm23 has been proposed to be due to transactivation of the human c-myc oncogene through binding to a homopyrimidine tract 140 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site (termed the CT element or the PuF site). Conventional transcription factors possess DNA binding and transactivation domains; Nm23 fusion proteins were used to address two questions. First, if provided with a well characterized DNA binding domain, does Nm23 possess a transactivation domain capable of stimulating transcription of an appropriate reporter? Second, if provided with a potent transactivation domain, is the DNA binding of Nm23 of sufficient specificity and affinity to direct the fusion protein to a CT-dependent reporter? Since reporter gene expression was not stimulated in either case, we conclude that Nm23 does not directly stimulate transcription through binding to the CT element and that its antimetastatic and other reported functions are likely due to other biochemical activities.

Interactions of Nm23 with small or heterotrimeric G proteins, GAP proteins, or microtubules have been postulated, but have been subject to considerable debate (reviewed in Ref. 5DeLaRosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A transcriptional regulatory activity for Nm23 was first proposed by Postel et al. (14Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 15Postel E.H. Ferrone C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8627-8630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) based principally upon in vitro observations. Protein from Escherichia coliexpressing a cDNA clone encoding nm23-H2 bound a probe derived from the nuclease-hypersensitive element (NHE site, also termed PuF site and CT element) derived from positions −142 to −115 of the c-myc promoter. Recombinant Nm23-H2/PuF bound to promoter fragments containing the GGGTGGG PuF recognition sequence and augmented c-myc transcription supported by a DEAE column fractionin vitro. Others have suggested that recombinant Nm23-H2/PuF recognizes a variety of single-stranded polypyrimidine-rich DNA and RNA sequences (18Hildebrandt M. Lacombe M. Mesnildrey S. Veron M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3858-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), including the NHE of the c-myc gene. Although structure of Nm23/NDPK has been determined and mutations that diminish interactions with nucleic acid have been engineered (19Postel E.H. Weiss V.H. Benken J. Kirtane A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6892-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the Nm23 sequence-specific DNA binding domain has not yet been delimited. The relative molar amounts of recombinant Nm23 proteinversus probe necessary to study binding in vitrowould indicate either that the DNA binding species in Nm23-H2/PuF preparations is a biochemically a minor fraction or alternatively that the nucleic acid-Nm23 interaction in vitro is weak. In vivo, an nm23-H2/PuF expression vector was reported to augment the expression of a c-myc reporter plasmid bearing the NHE by 3–4-fold in transient transfections (16Berberich S.J. Postel E.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar), but these studies leave unresolved the mechanism(s) through which Nm23-PuF might modify transcription. Given the broad specificity of Nm23-H2 in DNA binding assays in vitro, the high molar ratio of protein to DNA required to study nucleic binding, and the magnitude of its in vitro and in vivo effects on gene activation, we have designed a series of experiments to test for a direct role for the Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2 proteins in gene expression. Lysates of transiently transfected COS cells were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mmNaCl, 1% Triton, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 2 mmNa2VO4, and 10 mmNa2H2P2O7. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C. To immunoprecipitate Gal4 fusion proteins, the lystates were diluted 4-fold with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mmNaCl) and an anti-Gal4 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to a final concentration of approximately 30 μg/ml. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, 50 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose suspension (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) were added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.5% Triton in TBS, twice with TMD buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol), and finally resuspended in 30 μl of TMD buffer. Six microliters of the suspension were incubated with 1 μm[γ-32P]ATP and 0.1 mm GDP in a final volume of 8 μl at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with 1 volume of 50 mm EDTA, and 2 μl were applied to a 20 × 20-cm polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate (J. T. Baker Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ) and resolved by capillary action with 0.75 mKH2PO4, pH 3.65. The TLC plate was dried and exposed to autoradiography. HeLa and COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (6 × 106) were resuspended in 225 μl of 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (without calcium and magnesium) and incubated on ice 10 min with plasmid DNA. Electroporation was performed with a cellporator (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 180 V, 1180 microfarads setting. Following electroshock, cells were incubated on ice for an additional 10 min. Transfected cells were added to 10 ml of complete growth medium and incubated for 24 h before harvesting for CAT assays (20Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). The G/Nm23/VP16 fusion protein expression vectors were generated by cloning nm23 PCR products intoEcoRI, BamHI digested pG4/VP16 (21Tomonaga T. Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This vector expresses a G/VP16 fusion protein. 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides used for PCR of nm23-H1 were ACGCGTTGCGAATTCATGGCCAACTGTGAGCGTACCTTCATT and AGCTGCCGTGGATCCTTCATAGATCCAGTTCTGAGCACAGCT, respectively. 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides used for PCR of nm23-H2 were AGCCGTTGCGAATTCATGGCCAACCTGGAGCGCACCTTCATC and AGCCGTTGCGGATCCTTCATAGACCCAGTCATGAGCACAAGA, respectively. The G/Nm23 fusions were constructed similarly to the triple fusions except that a stop codon was introduced following the completion of thenm23 sequences. PCR products were cleaved withEcoRI and BamHI and gel purified before cloning. All clones were verified by double-stranded sequencing.nm23-H1/VP16 and nm23-H2/VP16 were constructed as follows: The BglII-PflMI fragments (encoding the entire Gal4 DBD and the amino termini of Nm23-H1 and Nm23-H2) were removed from G4/Nm23H1/VP16 and G4/Nm23H2/VP16 and the amino termini ofnm23-H1 and nm23H2 were restored by portions of their respective cDNAs, extending from the 5′-untranslated region through the PflMI sites. Nm23 expression vectors have been reported to stimulate modestly expression of the appropriate cotransfected reporters (16Berberich S.J. Postel E.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the various biochemical and physiological properties proven or ascribed to reside in this 17-kDa protein, a series of experiments were designed to test in vivo whether Nm23 could directly modify transcription. To assess the intrinsic transcriptional stimulatory capability of Nm23, it was directed to an upstream promoter region by fusion to the Gal4 DBD. Expression vectors encoding the Gal4 DBD fused with the H1 or H2nm23 isoforms (G/H1 and G/H2) were cotransfected into HeLa cells with a CAT reporter containing five Gal4 upstream activation sequences (UASs), each capable of binding a dimer of the Gal4 DBD. As a positive control, an expression construct encoding the Gal4 DBD linked to the Herpesvirus VP16 activation domain (G/VP16) strongly stimulated expression of the cotransfected CAT reporter (Fig.1 a, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, neither G/H1 or G/H2 stimulated CAT activity over the level seen with the Gal4 DNA binding domain alone (G, compare Fig. 1 A, lanes 7–10 with lanes 5 and6). Several possible artifactual explanations for the lack of activity by the nm23 constructs were investigated. Immunoblot analysis of extracts from transfected cells demonstrated proper expression of the full-length chimeric protein (data not shown). Nuclear localization and proper function of the Gal4 DBD when fused to the nm23 isoforms were preserved, since addition of the VP16 activation domain to the carboxyl terminus of the Gal4-Nm23 fusion proteins (G/H1/VP16 and G/H2/VP16) greatly increased levels of CAT activity (lanes 11–14). These experiments suggest that when tethered upstream of a promoter in vivo, Nm23 lacks an activation domain capable of interacting with the basal machinery and stimulating transcription. If the in vitro DNA binding by Nm23 to the PuF site is relevantin vivo, then the G/Nm23/VP16 constructs described above should bind to and transactivate a CAT reporter driven by the PuF/CT site. As a positive control, G/hnRNP K/VP16 was also transfected (21Tomonaga T. Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The hnRNP K protein binds sequence specifically to the top single strand of the PuF site in the c-myc promoter and is able to transactivate PuF/CT containing reporters with or without an artificially attached additional activation domain (21Tomonaga T. Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 22Takimoto M. Tomonaga T. Matunis M. Avigan M. Krutzsch H. Dreyfuss G. Levens D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2656-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Two elements of the experimental design are noteworthy. First, to prove nuclear localization and quantitate expression levels, constructs were also tested for activation of Gal4 site containing reporters. Stimulation through Gal4 UASs but absence of activation of the PuF/CT dependent reporter would indicate an in vivo failure to bind the PuF/CT element. Second, the VP16 activation domain would amplify any transcriptional stimulation resulting from binding as has been employed previously with hnRNP K (21Tomonaga T. Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of the G/K/VP16, G/H1/VP16, and G/H2/VP16 constructs with the Gal reporter showed that comparable amounts of functional nuclear fusion proteins were made in vivo (Fig.1 A, compare lanes 3 and 4 withlanes 11–14). As expected, G/K/VP16 protein bound to and transactivated a cotransfected CT-dependent reporter (as compared with the inactive G/VP16 fusion protein, which lacks a CT binding domain, Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 1 and2 with lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, neither G/Nm23/VP16 fusion protein activated transcription of this CT-dependent reporter and hence showed no evidence of binding in vivo (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5–8). Experiments were performed to test the possibility that the lack of functional activity by the triple-fusion constructs was due to misfolding or steric hindrance of the Nm23/PuF portion of the fusion protein. Such misfolding would be expected also to inhibit the NDPK activity of Nm23 in the triple fusion constructs. Extracts of cells transfected with the G/VP16, G/Nm23/VP16, and G/Nm23 expression vectors were immunoprecipitated with anti-Gal4 antibodies. The pellets were then washed and tested for the NDPK activity of Nm23 (Fig.2 B). Formation of [γ-32P]GTP from [γ-32P]ATP and cold GDP was stimulated by G/Nm23/VP16 and G/Nm23, but not by G/VP16 (the lower levels of NDPK activity in extracts of cells transfected with VP16 fusions paralleled lower protein levels of these chimeras, indicating that they were either less stable or expressed at lower levels (Fig.2 B)). Thus, the Nm23/PuF moieties in the triple-fusion expression constructs met the conformational stability requirements for enzymatic activity. These experiments indicate that the G/Nm23/VP16 fusions proteins fail to transactivate the PuF/CT-dependent reporter in vivo. Although Nm23 transcriptional activation has been described as requiring the greater context of the human c-mycpromoter, the powerful VP16 transactivating domain should bypass this prerequisite. Therefore, lack of transcription stimulation by the G/Nm23/VP16 fusion proteins of the CT-dependent reporter most likely was due to an inability to bind sequence specifically to the CT element and was not due to either misfolding of an otherwise high affinity DNA binding domain or an inability to interact with cooperating proteins. Nevertheless, a requirement by Nm23 for the intact c-myc promoter to activate transcription was directly investigated. The inability of the Gal4/Nm23/VP16 triple chimeras to stimulate CT element-dependent reporter gene expression indicated that the triple fusion protein did not bind with CT elements in vivo. Therefore, either these molecules intrinsically lacked biologically relevant CT element binding activity, or such activity was obstructed in the fusion protein. To eliminate the possibility that the Gal4 DBD interfered with the interaction of Nm23 with DNA, the same experiment was repeated with the dual Nm23/VP16 chimera retaining the natural Nm23 amino terminus (Fig. 3). Still no CT element-dependent activation was observed. It appears that irrespective of the presence or absence of the Gal4 DNA binding domain, Nm23/VP16 does not stimulate the transcription of a cotransfected CT element reporter. Nm23 has been reported to up-regulate transcription from a cotransfected reporter containing 409 base pairs of c-mycupstream promoter sequences (16Berberich S.J. Postel E.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar). The NDPK activity of Nm23 might provide a metabolic and indirect mechanism to explain these effects. To magnify any direct effect of Nm23 binding to DNA on c-mycpromoter activity, expression vectors for both G/H1/VP16 and G/H2/VP16 were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid containing 2.3 kb of c-myc upstream sequences. Despite the linkage to the powerful VP16 activation domain, neither isoform was able to enhance c-myc transcription relative to the G/VP16 control (Fig.4, compare lanes 3–6 withlanes 1 and 2). Strong stimulation of a cotransfected Gal4 UAS-driven reporter verified the synthesis of similar levels of active G/Nm23/VP16 and G/VP16 (data not shown). It appears that the specific DNA binding affinity of Nm23 for the CT element is insufficient to promote cis-element binding in vivo and hence that Nm23, alone, is not likely to be a CT-dependent transcription factor. Our data do not eliminate the possibilities that Nm23-H2/PuF might indirectly participate in transcription via a mechanism independent of the CT/PuF site or that special conditions or cofactors might be required to activate latent transcription factor activity. The inclusion of multiple positive controls in the experimental design has enabled a distinction between inconclusive and negative data. The biochemical features and mechanisms conferring a regulatory role upon Nm23 remain to be elucidated. The nm23 family of genes have been associated with diverse biological processes. Reduced Nm23 expression has been correlated with poor patient survival or other indicators of high tumor metastatic potential in cell line model systems as well as cohort studies of human breast, gastric, cervical, ovarian, and hepatocellular carcinomas and melanoma, although it does not represent an independent prognostic factor (reviewed in Ref. 5DeLaRosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Over expression of transfectednm23 reduced the in vivo tumor metastatic potential of melanoma and breast carcinoma cell lines, indicating that this gene suppresses metastasis (26Leone A. Flatow U.

Also, a role for thenm23/awd/ndpk gene family has been described in differentiation. Mutation or reduced expression of Drosophila awd resulted in altered morphology, aberrant differentiation, and cell necrosis in the wing disc and other organs postmetamorphosis, leading to death (31Dearolf C. Hersperger E. Shearn A. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 32Dearolf C. Tripoulas N. Biggs J. Shearn A. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining of Nm23 expression in mouse embryogenesis correlated increased protein expression with the functional differentiation of most epithelial tissues (33Lakso M. Steeg P.S. Westphal H. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 873-879PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection experiments have documented morphological, growth regulatory, and biosynthetic changes indicative of mammary differentiation following nm23-H1 transfection of human MDA-MB-435 cells (34Howlett A.R. Petersen O.W. Steeg P.S. Bissell M.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 1838-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Neuroendocrine differentiation followed transfection of the murine phaeochromocytoma PC12 cell line withnm23 (35Gervasi F. D'Agnano I. Vossio S. Zupi G. Sacchi A. Lombardi D. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1689-1695PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, nm23 influences genome stability as a mutator phenotype is present in knockout strains of bacteria (36Lu Q. Zhang X. Almaula N. Matthews C. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 37Zhang X. Lu Q. Inouye M. Matthews C.K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4115-4121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, particularly in unicellular lineages of cells, Nm23 expression often correlates with proliferation and lack of differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 5DeLaRosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). For some of these effects Nm23 was reported to function as a cytokine. If a transcription factor, then Nm23 might direct this broad spectrum of phenotypic changes through multiple target genes. Alternatively, its biological effects may be due to a series of protein targets for its enzymatic activity or through metabolic effects indirectly modifying the expression of other genes. The experiments presented in this report examined the hypothesis that a direct transcriptional role for Nm23 would most simply explain its biological properties. This role would impose two molecular requirements on the protein. First, in vivo Nm23 should have the capability of docking upon a cis-element, and second, that from this DNA based platform, Nm23 should project an effector domain capable of influencing the activity of a nearby promoter. Engrafting a strong activation domain, VP16, to any form of Nm23 failed to create an in vivo transactivator of a reporter plasmid driven by the sequence proposed to bind Nm23, NHE/CT element. The same triple chimera, Gal4/Nm23/VP16, which failed to activate thru a CT element, successfully stimulated a reporter otherwise identical except that the NHE/CT element was substituted with a Gal4 UAS. Therefore this artificial transactivator was expressed, localized to the nucleus, and when bound near a promoter, stimulated gene expression. Removing the Gal4 DBD (yielding Nm23/VP16), which might otherwise obstruct Nm23 DNA binding or re-direct the transactivator to alternative sequences, still failed to create a transactivator of NHE/CT elements. An important issue is the preservation of the native structure and activity of Nm23-H2/PuF in the double and triple fusion proteins. Following transfection, all of the chimeric proteins examined retained the best characterized enzymatic activity associated with Nm23, NDPK activity. Usually multifunctional proteins are formed by the linkage of structurally separable domains. Often distinct functions can be assigned to separated individual domains using biochemical and genetic approaches, although any allosteric coupling between these domains is lost. In contrast, due to the small size (17 kDa) and compact nature of Nm23, which folds into a single domain, the preservation of the NDPK kinase activity in the recombinant molecules used in this study should serve an accurate monitor of structural integrity. Unless alterations in Nm23-H2's secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure due to fusion cleanly abrogated the DNA binding activity of this small protein (17 kDa), without similarly effecting its enzymatic activity, the data argue that the Nm23-H2 proteins in double and triple constructs were functional. These experiments indicate that Nm23 is unikely to be a CT-dependent transcription factor in vivo. Our data do not eliminate the possibility that Nm23-H2/PuF might indirectly participate in transcription. Other known biochemical activities for the Nm23 protein family include a nonspecific nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndpk) activity (6Wallet V. Mutzel R. Troll H. Barzu O. Wurster B. Veron M.

https://openalex.org/W2027584098,"Various segments of the 3′-nontranslated region of the renal glutaminase (GA) mRNA were tested for their ability to enhance turnover and pH responsiveness. The combined effects were retained in the 340-base R-2 segment. However, the combined R-1 and R-3 fragments also imparted a partial destabilization and pH responsiveness to a chimeric β-globin mRNA. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that cytosolic extracts of rat renal cortex contain a protein that binds to the R-2 and R-3 RNAs. The binding observed with the R-2 RNA was mapped to a direct repeat of an 8-base AU sequence. This binding was effectively competed with an excess of the same RNA, but not by adjacent or unrelated RNAs. UV cross-linking experiments identified a 48-kDa protein that binds to the AU repeats of the R-2 RNA. The apparent binding of this protein was greatly reduced in renal cytosolic extracts prepared from acutely acidotic rats. Two related RNA sequences in the R-3 segment also exhibited specific binding. However, the latter binding was more effectively competed by R-2 RNA than by itself, indicating that the homologous sites may be weaker binding sites for the same 48-kDa protein. Thus, a single protein may bind specifically to multiple instability elements within the 3′-nontranslated region of the GA mRNA and mediate its pH-responsive stabilization.

Thus, a single protein may bind specifically to multiple instability elements within the 3′-nontranslated region of the GA mRNA and mediate its pH-responsive stabilization. Increased catabolism of glutamine is an important component of the renal adaptation that occurs in response to onset of metabolic acidosis (1Tannen R.L. Orloff J. Berliner R.W. Handbook of Physiology: Renal Physiology. I. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 1017-1059Google Scholar). In normal acid-base balance, the kidney metabolizes very little of the plasma glutamine (2Brosnan J.T. Vinay P. Gougoux A. Halperin M.L. Häussinger D. pH Homeostasis-Mechanism and Control. Academic Press, Inc., New York1988: 281-304Google Scholar). In contrast, during metabolic acidosis, approximately one-third of the arterial glutamine is extracted in a single pass through this organ. The increased renal catabolism of glutamine yields ammonium ions, which are largely excreted in the urine to facilitate the excretion of acids. The further catabolism of the carbon skeleton of glutamine generates bicarbonate ions, which are added to the blood to partially compensate the decrease in pH. The mitochondrial glutaminase catalyzes the initial reaction in the primary pathway for renal metabolism of glutamine (3Curthoys N.P. Watford M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). During chronic acidosis, the level of this activity is increased 7–20-fold within the rat renal proximal convoluted tubule (4Curthoys N.P. Lowry O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wright P.A. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F961-F970PubMed Google Scholar). The increased activity results from an increased rate of glutaminase synthesis (6Tong J. Harrison G. Curthoys N.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which correlates with an increase in the level of total and of translatable GA 1The abbreviations used are: GA, glutaminase; βG, β-globin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; BSA, bovine serum albumin; bp, base pair(s). mRNA (7Tong J. Shapiro R.A. Curthoys N.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2773-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Hwang J-J. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol.

However, the increased level of GA mRNA is not due to an increased rate of transcription (8Hwang J-J. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9392-9396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hwang J-J. Perera S. Shapiro R.A. Curthoys N.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7522-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These results suggested that increased expression of the GA gene may result from the selective stabilization of the GA mRNA. Rat kidney contains two forms of GA mRNA, a 5.0-kilobase and a less abundant 3.4-kilobase mRNA (8Hwang J-J. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9392-9396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hwang J-J. Perera S. Shapiro R.A. Curthoys N.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7522-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The smaller GA mRNA is probably synthesized by use of an internal polyadenylation site that is located at position 2984 in the GA cDNA (10Shapiro R.A. Farrell L. Srinivasan M. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18792-18796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of both GA mRNAs are coordinately affected in response to onset and recovery from metabolic acidosis (8Hwang J-J. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9392-9396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hwang J-J. Perera S. Shapiro R.A. Curthoys N.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7522-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that a 955-bp segment, which comprises the portion of the 3′-nontranslated region that is common to both GA mRNAs, contains a pH-responsive instability element (11Hansen W.R. Barsic-Tress N. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F126-F131PubMed Google Scholar). This was demonstrated by cloning this segment into the 3′-nontranslated region of a gene that encodes a β-globin/growth hormone (βG) mRNA. The parent pβG construct produced high levels of a very stable βG mRNA when expressed in LLC-PK1-F+ cells, a pH-responsive line of pig renal proximal tubule-like cells (12Gstraunthaler G. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C232-C238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Holcomb T. Curthoys N.P. Gstraunthaler G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C449-C457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of the βG mRNA was unaffected by transferring the cells to acidic medium (pH 6.9, 10 mm HCO3−). In contrast, the chimeric construct, pβG-GA, which contains the additional GA cDNA sequence, was expressed at significantly lower levels in stable transfectants of LLC-PK1-F+cells grown in normal medium (pH 7.4, 25 mmHCO3−). The decreased expression resulted from the more rapid turnover (t½ = 4.6 h) of the βG-GA mRNA. The transfer of the latter cells to acidic medium resulted in a pronounced stabilization and a gradual induction of the βG-GA mRNA. In the current study, the apparent half-lives and the pH responsiveness of various deletions of the pβG-GA construct were characterized. RNA gel shift analyses were also performed to further map the binding sites of a 48-kDa GA mRNA binding protein that is contained in cytosolic extracts of rat renal cortex. The apparent binding of this protein is decreased significantly in extracts prepared from acutely acidotic rats. The results of the two approaches indicate that redundant AU-rich binding elements mediate the inherent instability and the pH-responsive stabilization of the GA mRNA.

GeneScreen Plus was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Gel-blotting paper was purchased from Schleicher and Schuell. RNAsin was from Promega. Sequenase version 2.0 and agarose-LMP were obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium and Geneticin were products of Life Technologies, Inc. Guanidine thiocyanate and sodium-N-lauryl sarcosine were obtained from Fluka. Tissue culture plates were purchased from Dow Corning. All other biochemicals were purchased from Sigma. LLC-PK1-F+ cells were obtained from Gerhard Gstraunthaler (12Gstraunthaler G. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C232-C238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured as described previously (13Holcomb T. Curthoys N.P. Gstraunthaler G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C449-C457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a 50:50 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and Ham's F12 media containing 5 mm glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. Cell lines expressing the various βG-GA chimeric mRNAs were produced by transfection with calcium phosphate-precipitated DNA (14Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) and selection with Geneticin. Total RNA was isolated from LLC-PK1-F+ cells according to the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and mRNA half-life determinations and Northern analysis were performed as described previously (11Hansen W.R. Barsic-Tress N. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F126-F131PubMed Google Scholar). The initial β-globin expression vector (pβG) was created by ligating aPvuII/Bg1II fragment of the rabbit β-globin gene into the HindIII site of pRc/RSV (Invitrogen). Thus, pβG contains the strong viral promoter derived from the long terminal repeat of the Rous sarcoma virus followed by the transcriptional start site, the 5′-nontranslated region, the full coding sequence, and two introns of the rabbit β-globin gene; a multicloning site containing four unique restriction sites; and the 3′-nontranslated region and polyadenylation site of the bovine growth hormone gene (11Hansen W.R. Barsic-Tress N. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F126-F131PubMed Google Scholar). pβG-GA was created by cloning a 955-bp AccI/DrdI restriction fragment from pGA-12 (10Shapiro R.A. Farrell L. Srinivasan M. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18792-18796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the multicloning site of pβG. The inserted GA cDNA fragment contains 72 bp of coding sequence and extends to a site 18 bp 5′ of the internal polyadenylation signal (Fig. 1). The initial set of deletion constructs (pβG-GA1, pβG-GA2, and pβG-GA3) was generated by PCR amplification of the desired sequences within pGA-12 (10Shapiro R.A. Farrell L. Srinivasan M. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18792-18796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ primer (primer 2175, 5′-CAGACTAGTATTTACAACATCTGTCCCTG-3′) and the 3′ primer (primer 2985, 5′-ACGTCTAGATTGTAGAAGCTGAGAAGACC-3′) were used to synthesize pβG-GA1, which contains bases 2175–2985 of the 3′-nontranslated region of the GA cDNA (Fig. 1 A). The two primers contained SpeI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively (in boldface type). Similarly, the cDNA insert for pβG-GA2, which extends from base 2015 to 2866 was synthesized using primer 2015 (5′-GAGACTAGACCTCAAGGGGACGA-3′ and primer 2866 (5′-GACTCTAGAAGAGCAGAAATGGGAGGCTTGAT-3′. Finally, pβG-GA3, which extends from base 2175 to 2894, was synthesized using primer 2175 (see above) and primer 2894 (5′-CAGTCTAGAATAAACAGCCAAGCTCCTATC-3′). In each case, the primers were designed to have similar T m values. For the PCR amplification, the primers were diluted to a final concentration of 0.2 μm, and the pGA-12 cDNA template was used at a final concentration of 0.27 ng/ml. The fragments produced from the PCR reaction were purified from a 1% low melting temperature agarose gel, digested with SpeI and XbaI restriction enzymes, and ligated into the corresponding sites in the multicloning region of pβG. The remaining constructs were produced by deletion of sequences from pβG-GA3 (Fig. 1 A). pβG-GA4 was synthesized by digesting pβG-GA3 with NheI and BstEII and religating to yield a vector containing GA bases 2175–2343 and 2684–2894. The resulting NheI/BstEII fragment was blunted and ligated into pβG to create pβG-GA5, which contained GA sequence from bases 2344–2683. pβG-GA6 contained the same sequence as pβG-GA5 but was inserted in the reverse orientation. The validity of all constructs was verified by restriction mapping and dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Rats were made acutely acidotic by stomach-loading them with 20 mmol of NH4Cl/kg body weight. Normal and 16-h acutely acidotic rats were anesthetized with 1 mg/kg body weight of pentobarbital and opened with a midline incision. The kidneys were perfused in situwith a Krebs-Henseleit solution. They were removed immediately, decapsulated, sliced longitudinally, and placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit solution. The cortex was dissected from the papilla and the medulla, cut into small pieces, weighed, and placed in an equal volume of 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm antipain, and 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The tissue was homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. An aliquot of homogenate was examined microscopically for released nuclei and then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g to pellet intact cells and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria and then for 2 h at 100,000 × g to pellet membrane bound organelles and polyribosomes. The final supernatant was aliquoted and frozen at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The initial construct (pBS-GA) was created by inserting a NotI/SpeI fragment obtained from pβG-GA intoNotI/SpeI-digested pBlueScript-SKII(−) (pBS). A portion of the multiple cloning site of pBS was deleted by digesting with Asp718 and SpeI, followed by blunting with Klenow fragment, and religating. The Asp718 site was conserved and used for later deletion constructs. Thus, pBS-GA contains the original 955-bp fragment, which was cloned into pβG-GA and is able to produce sense transcripts from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. pBS-GA2344 and pBS-GA2684 were constructed by an Asp718/NheI and anAsp718/BstEII deletion of pBS-GA, respectively, followed by blunting and religation (Fig. 1 B). Similar strategies combining PCR amplification and cleavage at unique restriction sites (see Figs. 5 and 8) were used to synthesize the expression vectors needed to transcribe the RNAs that were used to map the RNA binding sites contained in the R-2 and R-3 RNAs. The vector used to transcribe the R-2I RNA was constructed by annealing and inserting two oligonucleotides, 5′-GTACCTCTTTAAATATTAAAATAATTACTACTAAT-3′ and 5′-CTAGATTAGTAGTAATTATTTTAATATTTAAAGAG-3′ into pBlueScript, which was previously restricted with Asp718 andXbaI. The boldface letters in the oligonucleotide sequences designate partial Asp718 and XbaI sites, respectively. The vectors used to transcribe the mutated sequences of the R-2I RNA were similarly synthesized from pairs of oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations (see Fig. 6).Figure 8Mapping of the protein binding sites within the R-3 segment of the GA mRNA. A, various lengths of the R-3 segment of the GA cDNA were cloned in pBlueScript by using the indicated restriction sites. The resulting vectors were then used to synthesize the indicated RNA probes (R-3A through R-3D). The lengths of the GA sequences in the various probes are indicated in bases (b) and are drawn to scale. B, the various32P-labeled probes were incubated with 3 μg of BSA or 3 μg of a cytosolic extract of rat renal cortex. The unbound RNA was then digested with RNase T1, and the remaining RNA-protein complexes were resolved on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and exposed either to x-ray film or a PhosphorImager screen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Mutation analysis of the specific binding to the R-2I segment. A, probe R-2I contains two direct repeats of an 8-base AU-sequence. The two sequences are 88% identical, but only the first sequence contains an SspI restriction site. Three mutated RNAs (m1–m3) were synthesized to contain a 5-base GC sequence in the core of either or both of the 8-base AU regions of the R-2I segment. B, the various32P-labeled probes were incubated with 3 μg of BSA or 3 μg of a cytosolic extract of rat renal cortex. The unbound RNA was then digested with RNase T1, and the remaining RNA-protein complexes were resolved on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and exposed either to x-ray film or a PhosphorImager screen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The pBlueScript-SKII(−) plasmid contains a BssHII site immediately upstream of the T7 promoter. Thus, the desired templates were obtained by restricting the various expression vectors with BssHII and a second restriction enzyme. For example, transcript R-1 was synthesized from the BssHII/NheI fragment of pBS-GA, transcript R-2 from the BssHII/BstEII fragment of pBS-GA2344, and transcript R-3 from the BssHII fragment of pBS-GA2684 (Fig.1 B). Similar fragments were also isolated from the additional transcription vectors to synthesize the smaller RNAs that were used to map the binding elements within the R-2 and R-3 RNAs (Figs. 5 and 8). Templates for the nonrelated RNAs were obtained by restricting pBlueScript with either PvuII or with BssHI and NotI. The former template yields a 335-base transcript, while the latter yields a 96-base RNA. The DNA templates were resolved in 8% acrylamide gels and eluted by the crush and soak method (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.1-6.48Google Scholar). In vitro transcription was performed using a slight modification of the standard method (18Melton D.A. Kreig P.A. Rebogliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). The 10-μl reaction mixture contained the following components: 10 ng/μl DNA template, [α-32P]UTP (40 μCi), 0.2 mmATP, CTP, and GTP, 50 μm unlabeled UTP, 20 units of RNAsin, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. After incubating at 37 °C for 1 h, 1.0 unit of RNase-free DNase was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. RNA was extracted with an equal volume of a 25:24:1 mixture of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitated two times in 0.5m ammonium acetate with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol at −20 °C. The pelleted RNA was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. The final product was quantitated by scintillation counting, and the volume was adjusted to yield the desired concentration. Synthesis of unlabeled RNA was performed using a 100-μl reaction mixture lacking [α32P]UTP but containing a 0.2 mmconcentration of each ribonucleotide. This assay was performed as described by Alberta et al. (19Alberta J.A. Rundell K. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4532-4538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. An aliquot of rat renal cortical extract containing 3 μg of protein was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 2 μg of yeast tRNA in 10 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 units of RNAsin. Then, approximately 10–40 fmol of labeled probe was added, and where indicated, a 250- or 500-fold excess of specific or nonspecific competitors was also added. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then 15 units of RNase T1 were added and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were adjusted to 2.5% Ficoll, 0.04% Bromphenol Blue, 0.04% xylene cyanol and subjected to electrophoresis for approximately 3 h in a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 170 V using a 90 mm Tris, 110 mm boric acid, 2 mmEDTA running buffer. Gels were dried and exposed either to film or a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). The addition of RNAsin was necessary to maintain the integrity of the probe during the initial incubation with the cytosolic extracts. The procedure of You et al. (20You Y. Chen C-Y.A. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2931-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. The samples were prepared as described for the RNA gel shift experiments, except that following RNase T1 digestion, they were transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate and exposed to shortwave (254 nm) radiation for 5 min in a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) on the automatic setting. The samples were then transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. An equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer was added, and the tubes were heated in boiling water for 5 min. Samples were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide). The gel was then dried and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C or a PhosphorImager screen. A pH-responsive stabilization of the βG-GA chimeric mRNA, which contains 955 bases of the 3′-nontranslated region of the GA mRNA, was observed in LLC-PK1-F+ cells (11Hansen W.R. Barsic-Tress N. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F126-F131PubMed Google Scholar). Six deletion constructs were synthesized and tested to further delineate the region that mediates this response (Fig.2). The separate cell lines, when grown in normal medium (pH 7.4, 25 mmHCO3−), expressed levels of the chimeric mRNAs that were similar to that of the full-length βG-GA mRNA. In addition, the levels of all six mRNAs were increased 1.5–2-fold when the cells were maintained in acidic medium (pH 6.9, 10 mm HCO3−) for 18 h (data not shown). The apparent half-lives of the chimeric mRNAs were measured by selectively inhibiting polymerase II transcription with 65 μm5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (21Dubois M.-F. Nguyen V.T. Bellier S. Bensaude O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13331-13336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The parent βG mRNA was very stable, and its rate of turnover was unaffected when the LLC-PK1-F+ cells were transferred to acidic medium (11Hansen W.R. Barsic-Tress N. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F126-F131PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the βG-GA mRNA, which contains the original 955-base insert, decayed with an apparent half-life of 4.6 h in cells grown in normal medium. Following transfer to acidic medium, the apparent half-life of the βG-GA mRNA was increased approximately 6-fold (t½ = 29 h). The chimeric mRNAs produced from the pβG-GA1, pβG-GA2, and pβG-GA3constructs contain deletions of either or both of the putative stem-loop structures previously identified in the GA mRNA (10Shapiro R.A. Farrell L. Srinivasan M. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18792-18796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All three mRNAs exhibited a rapid turnover in cells grown in normal medium (t½ values range from 5.2 to 6.7 h) and a significant stabilization when transferred to acidic medium (t½ values range from 15 to 29 h). Thus, neither of the two putative stem-loop structures is the primary determinant of the rapid turnover or the pH-responsive stabilization of the GA mRNA. βG-GA4 contains two segments of GA mRNA sequence that extend from base 2175 to 2343 and base 2684 to 2894. This mRNA was destabilized in cells grown in normal medium (t½ ≈ 8 h) and exhibited a slight pH response (1.9-fold). In contrast, βG-GA5, mRNA which contains only the bases 2344–2683, i.e. the bases deleted in the βG-GA4 construct, was also significantly destabilized (t½ ≈ 8 h) and exhibited a strong pH response (3.8-fold). Interestingly, when this sequence was inserted into pβG in the reverse orientation, the resulting βG-GA6 mRNA was less effectively destabilized (t½ = 15 h) but was still slightly pH-responsive (1.8-fold). These results suggest that the 3′-nontranslated region of the GA mRNA contains multiple functional elements that contribute to its inherent lability and pH-responsive stabilization. RNA gel shift analyses were performed to determine if cytosolic extracts of rat kidney cortex contain a protein that exhibits specific binding to the 3′-nontranslated region of the GA mRNA. Initial experiments were performed using three RNAs, R-1, R-2, and R-3, which correspond to bases 2009–2343, 2344–2683, and 2684–2963 of the GA mRNA, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Due to the length of the RNA probes, it was necessary to digest the free RNA and the RNA-protein complexes with RNase T1 before separating them by electrophoresis on a native polyacrylamide gel. When R-1 was used as a labeled probe, a minor band was detected, which exhibited a greater electrophoretic mobility than the undigested probe. However, this band is nonspecific because it was effectively competed by an excess of nonlabeled R-1, R-2, and R-3 and a nonrelated RNA containing 335 bases that was synthesized from pBlueScript (data not shown). In contrast, when R-2 was used as the 32P-labeled probe, a more intense banding pattern was observed (Fig.3 A). The shifted band exhibited a mobility different from that of the undigested probe and represented specific binding. The band was effectively competed with a 500-fold excess of unlabeled R-2 but was not competed by the same concentration of R-1 or the nonrelated RNA obtained from pBlueScript. The addition of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled R-3 RNA slightly reduced the binding to the R-2 RNA. Furthermore, the amount of the bound R-2 probe was increased with increasing amounts of the cytosolic extract (data not shown). When labeled R-3 was incubated with the renal cortical extract, two discrete bands were observed (Fig.3 B). These bands were also specific. They exhibited a mobility different from the undigested probe and they were competed by a 500-fold excess of unlabeled R-3. They were not competed by unlabeled R-1 or the nonrelated RNA obtained from pBlueScript. However, they were effectively competed by R-2. Competition with increasing amounts of R-2 and R-3 indicated that the observed bands were more effectively competed with lower amounts of R-2 than with itself (data not shown). Thus, this segment apparently contains two specific binding sites that have lower affinity for the same protein that binds to R-2. Cytosolic extracts were also prepared from the renal cortex of rats that were made acutely acidotic. The apparent binding of the32P-labeled R-2 and R-3 probes to cytosolic proteins from normal and acutely acidotic rats was then compared (Fig.4). The 32P-labeled R-2 probe produced a significant shift when incubated with 1.5 μg of the normal cytosolic extract. The intensity of this shift was nearly doubled when 3.0 μg of extract was used. In contrast, no specific binding was evident when 1.5 μg of the extract from an acutely acidotic rat was used. A slight binding was detectable with 3.0 μg of the latter extract. In contrast, with the 32P-labeled R-3 probe, the apparent binding responsible for the larger of the two shifted bands was reduced only 2-fold in acidotic versus normal extracts, whereas the binding responsible for formation of the smaller band was apparently unchanged. Thus, the onset of acidosis causes a large decrease in the apparent binding to the R-2 RNA but only a slight decrease in the intensity of only one of the two bands observed with the R-3 RNA. Additional RNA probes, R-2A through R-2I, were generated to further map the site of protein binding to the R-2 segment of the GA mRNA (Fig.5). The full banding pattern was retained in the first three constructs, which deleted increasing lengths of sequence from the 5′-end of R-2. The R-2D probe, which contained the sequence deleted in the R-2A through R-2C probes, and the R-2E probe, which lacked only the 82-base GA sequence from the 3′-end of R-2, failed to exhibit any protein binding. Based upon these data, it was anticipated that the specific binding was limited to the region containing the final 82 bases of the R-2 sequence. However, when this sequence (R-2F) was tested, only a less intense band that has a slower mobility was produced. Thus, three additional probes (R-2G through R-2I) were tested. All of the latter constructs including R-2I, which contains a 29-base sequence from GA, retained the initial banding pattern. Probes R-2F and R-2I were effectively com"

Loss of PFK2 causes elevated levels of metabolites such as glucose-6-P, hyperaccumulation of glycogen, and activation of glycogen synthase, whereas glucose-6-P is reduced in snf1 cells. Other mutations that increase glucose-6-P, deletion of PFK1, which codes for the α-subunit of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, or of PGI1, the phosphoglucoisomerase gene, had similar effects on glycogen metabolism as did pfk2 mutants. We propose that elevated glucose-6-P mediates the effects of these mutations on glycogen storage. Glycogen synthase kinase activity was reduced in extracts from pfk2cells but was restored to that of wild type if the extract was gel-filtered to remove small molecules. Also, added glucose-6-P inhibited the glycogen synthase kinase activity in extracts from wild-type cells, half-maximally at ∼2 mm. We suggest that glucose-6-P controls glycogen synthase activity by two separate mechanisms. First, glucose-6-P is a direct activator of glycogen synthase, and second, it controls the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase by inhibiting a glycogen synthase kinase.

Glycogen is a storage form of glucose in a wide variety of organisms and cell types. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glycogen accumulation is normally initiated in response to nutrient limitation, prior to entry into stationary phase (1François J. Blazquez M.A. Ariño J. Gancedo C. Yeast Sugar Metabolism.in: Zimmermann F.K. Technomics Publishing Co. Inc., Lancaster, PA1997Google Scholar). Glycogen biosynthesis requires a self-glucosylating initiator protein, glycogenin, glycogen synthase for chain elongation, and branching enzyme to introduce the α-1,6-glycosidic branch points (2Skurat A. Roach P.J. LeRoith D. Olefsky J.M. Taylor S.I. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 213-222Google Scholar). Over the past few years, the yeast genes encoding enzymes responsible for glycogen biosynthesis have been identified, including two glycogen synthase genes, GSY1 and GSY2 (3Farkas I. Hardy T.A. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20879-20886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Farkas I. Hardy T.A. Goebl M.G. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15602-15607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).GSY2 encodes the major nutritionally regulated form of glycogen synthase (4Farkas I. Hardy T.A. Goebl M.G. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15602-15607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One control of GSY2 is by its increased expression at the approach of stationary phase (4Farkas I. Hardy T.A. Goebl M.G. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15602-15607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this protein is regulated by covalent phosphorylation, which decreases its activity when measured in the absence of glucose-6-P (5Rothman-Denes L.B. Cabib E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Huang K-P. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3851-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, activity is restored even to fully phosphorylated enzyme by the presence of glucose-6-P, so the −/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio is frequently used as an index of the activation state of glycogen synthase. Glycogen synthase can be rate-determining for glycogen synthesis in yeast, and mutation of potential phosphorylation sites in Gsy2p results in overaccumulation of glycogen (7Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in GAC1 andGLC7, which encode type 1 phosphatase subunits, cause a decreased −/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio and concomitantly impaired glycogen deposition (8Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9François J. Thompson-Jaeger S Skroch J. Zellenka U. Spevak W. Tatchell K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Conversely, deletion of PHO85, which encodes a glycogen synthase kinase catalytic subunit, leads to glycogen hyperaccumulation (10Timblin B.K. Tatchell K. Bergman L.W. Genetics. 1996; 143: 57-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Huang D. Farkas I. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4357-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Another gene that influences glycogen storage is SNF1 (8Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Thompson-Jaeger S. François J. Gaughran J.P. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1991; 129: 697-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes a protein kinase essential for expression of glucose-repressible genes (13Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, snf1 mutants grow poorly on alternative carbon sources (14Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1981; 98: 25-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also fail to accumulate glycogen (8Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Thompson-Jaeger S. François J. Gaughran J.P. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1991; 129: 697-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We had previously suggested that the inability of snf1 mutants to synthesize glycogen was caused by hyperphosphorylation, and hence inactivation, of glycogen synthase (15Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27907-27913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we searched for second site suppressors of the glycogen accumulation defect of snf1 cells. One of the resulting suppressor genes was identified as PFK2, which encodes one subunit of the glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (16Heinisch J. Ritzel R.G. Borstel R.C.V. Aguilera A. Rodicio R. Zimmermann F.K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 78: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We propose that the glycogen storage phenotype caused by this mutation results from high intracellular glucose-6-P levels and that glucose-6-P acts not only as a direct activator of glycogen synthase but also as an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase activity. The S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table I. Rich medium (YP) contains 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% concentration of the indicated carbon source. Synthetic medium consists of yeast nitrogen base (6.7 g/liter), lacking the appropriate amino acid, and 2% concentration of the indicated carbon source. Cells carrying apgi1 disruption were grown in rich medium with 2% fructose and 0.1% glucose (YPFD). Plasmids were maintained in Escherichia coli strain DH5α.

DH65 and DH66 are the progeny of five and four backcrosses, respectively, to the wild type strain EG328-1A from F243. The DH strains are all related to EG328-1A. For disruption of PFK2, the polymerase chain reaction was used to generate a DNA fragment that contained PFK2 sequences straddling a URA3 marker gene (20Lorenz M.C. Muir R.S. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S.C. Heitman J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The vector pRS306 (21Sikorski R.S. Heiter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the template for the polymerase chain reaction. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product contained the 5′ sequence (+242 to +287, referred to the open reading frame) and 3′ sequence (+2806 to +2851) of PFK2 at each end of a 1.1-kilobase pair sequence containing the URA3gene. This DNA fragment was then used to transform strains EG328-1A, EG327-1D, and EG353-1C to replace the PFK2 gene and generate strains DH55-0, DH54-0, and DH58-0. Gene disruption in Ura+transformants was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. A similar strategy was employed to disrupt PFK1 and PGI1(Table I). For pgi1disruption, Ura+ transformants were selected in synthetic complete media without uracil and containing fructose (2%) and a low concentration of glucose (0.1%) as carbon source. Since diploids homozygous forsnf1 do not sporulate, we crossed an ssg1 snf1:: URA3 mutant to an isogenic wild-type strain DH66 (Ura−). Tetrad analysis revealed segregation ratios of 2+:2−, 3+:1− and 4+:0− for glycogen accumulation, with most tetrads 3+:1−, indicating that mutation in a single gene was responsible for the phenotype. The sporulation also yielded tetratypes consisting of one Ura− colony with normal glycogen (SSG1 SNF1), one Ura+ colony with normal glycogen (ssg1 snf1), one Ura+colony defective for glycogen (SSG1 snf1), and one Ura− colony with hyperaccumulation of glycogen (ssg1 SNF1). For spores segregating 2+:2−, the two glycogen-positive clones always hyperaccumulated and were Ura−, while the two glycogen negative clones were Ura+. These results suggest that, besides restoring glycogen in snf1 cells, ssg1 caused hyperaccumulation of glycogen in a wild-type background. We also tested whether ssg1 would overcome the glycogen deficit inglc7-1 cells, which are defective in the type 1 protein phosphatase catalytic subunit (8Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When an ssg1 strain (DH59-13) was crossed with EG327-1D (glc7-1), the resulting tetrads exhibited a 3+:1− segregation ratio for positive glycogen storage, suggesting that the ssg1mutation suppresses the glc7-1 glycogen-deficient phenotype. Multiple independent ssg1 glc7-1 double mutant strains were isolated and found to accumulate an intermediate level of glycogen. Thus, the ssg1 mutation partially suppressed the glycogen phenotype of glc7-1. A genomic library cloned in YCp50 (22Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), kindly provided by John Cannon (University of Missouri, Columbia), was used to transform a glycogen-accumulating ssg1 glc7-1 ura3strain (DH54-102). From approximately 5000 transformants, we obtained 14 colonies in which glycogen accumulation was eliminated as judged by iodine staining of colonies. We isolated a plasmid, YCSSG1-1, containing a 17.5-kilobase pair insert, that complemented thessg1 phenotype. Complementation was localized to a 2.9-kilobase pair EcoRI-EcoRI fragment, which, from sequence analysis, matched the PFK2 gene. The fragment began at +817 in the coding region of PFK2, exactly the sameEcoRI fragment as had previously been reported to complementpfk2 defects (23Heinisch J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine that the cloned sequence contained the SSG1 locus, the 2.9-kilobase pair fragment was integrated into the genome of strain DH54-102. The transformants had a glycogen-deficient phenotype. Two such transformants were mated with DH66 (ura3) to yield a strain with the putativessg1-URA3-SSG1 integration in a GLC7 background (DH60). This strain was then crossed to DH65 (SSG1 GLC7 URA3) and DH59-13 (ssg1 GLC7 ura3). When crossed to DH65, 10 tetrads examined revealed 4:0 segregation for the Ssg1+ phenotype (normal glycogen) and 4:0, 3:1, or 2:2 for Ura+. In a cross with DH59-13, 10 tetrads segregated 2:2 for both Ssg1+ and Ura+, and Ssg1+was always linked to Ura+. The tight linkage between Ssg1+ and Ura+ suggests that the cloned DNA derived from the ssg1 locus. Yeast cells were collected at late log phase (5–8 × 107 cells/ml), unless indicated otherwise, and resuspended in a homogenization buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4. The cells were broken with glass beads as described previously (7Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase was assayed by the method of Thomas et al. (24Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) as described by Hardy et al. (15Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27907-27913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the extracts were first passed over a Sephadex G25 spin column to remove low molecular weight compounds as described below. A unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of 1 μmol of glucose from UDP-glucose to glycogen per min under conditions of the standard assay. The total activity of glycogen synthase is that measured in the presence of 7.2 mm glucose 6-phosphate. The −/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio is defined as the activity measured in the absence of glucose-6-P divided by that measured in its presence. Each measurement was the average of duplicate assays. Glycogen synthase kinase activity in extracts was measured by two procedures. In one, the inactivation of added, purified recombinant Gsy2p protein was followed with time, monitoring the decrease in the −/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio. In the reaction, 20 μl of purified Gsy2p (0.76 mg/ml), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol was mixed with 300 μl of yeast lysate (adjusted to ∼4 mg of protein/ml) prepared as described above. The reaction was started by the addition of 80 μl of 25 mm ATP in 750 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4, together with any other additions. After incubation at 30 °C for different times, a portion (40 μl) was removed, mixed with 10 μl of 0.3 m EDTA, 0.4m NaF to terminate the reaction, and loaded onto a spin column (Sephadex G25, 1.5-ml volume). After centrifugation at 1000 rpm in an IEC Clinical Centrifuge for 3 min, the pass-through was collected, mixed with 50 μl of the same homogenization buffer described above but with 100 mm NaF, and assayed for glycogen synthase activity. In some experiments, cell extracts were pretreated with Sephadex G25 columns to remove endogenous glucose-6-P prior to initiating the protein kinase reaction. In control experiments in which we measured glucose-6-P levels, we found that the spin column removed over 95% of the glucose-6-P. To measure glycogen synthase kinase with this assay, we had to use gsy2 strains so that the endogenous glycogen synthase activity, which is reduced to about one-tenth of wild type, does not interfere significantly with that of the added Gsy2p. The amount of added Gsy2p gives a level of activity about twice that in a normal extract of wild-type cells. In the second assay for glycogen synthase kinase activity, the direct phosphorylation of purified Gsy2p added to cell extracts was determined by analyzing the incorporation of 32P into Gsy2p from [γ-32P]ATP. Yeast cells were grown and collected as described above. The cells were resuspended in a homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Cell extracts were prepared using glass beads and, in some cases, were passed over a Sephadex G25 spin column as described above. Yeast extract (5 μl, diluted to ∼2.5 mg of protein/ml with homogenization buffer) was combined with 2.5 μg of His6Gsy2p and 100 nm okadaic acid in a final volume of 20 μl. In some experiments, glucose 6-phosphate was also added from an aqueous stock solution. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP mix (1 mm ATP, 25 mmMgCl2, ∼1200 cpm/pmol). After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, 25 μl of a 1:1 slurry of nickel-nitrolotriacetic acid-agarose in wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitors as above) was added, followed by 500 μl of ice-cold wash buffer, and the incubation continued on ice for a further 30 min with occasional gentle agitation. The nickel-nitrolotriacetic acid-agarose was collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed four times with 500 μl of wash buffer. Bound His6Gsy2p was eluted using 25 μl of wash buffer with the imidazole concentration increased to 500 mm. The eluted material was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and autoradiography. Determination of glucose-6-P was a variation of the method of Lang and Michal (26Lang G. Michal G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 1235-1242Google Scholar) as described by Wilson (27Wilson, W. A. (1995) Characterization of a Homologue of the Mammalian AMP-activated Protein Kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Dundee, Scotland.Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by rapid filtration, resuspended in perchloric acid (5%), and broken with glass beads. The acid extracts were collected and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was extracted twice to remove perchloric acid with 10% excess (by volume) of a 1:1 mixture of tri-n-octylamine and 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane. Glucose-6-P was measured by using 0.5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.05 mm NADP. Typically, a relative value for glucose-6-P level was obtained by normalizing to the absorbance at 600 nm. To give an indication of the absolute concentrations, measurements of glucose-6-P in wild-type cells were also expressed in terms of the dry weight of cells. Glycogen was determined in extracts of cells as described by Hardy et al. (7Hardy T.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23799-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant His6Gsy2p with an NH2-terminal poly-His tag was produced in E. coli and purified as described previously (11Huang D. Farkas I. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4357-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was a variant of the method of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Cells defective in the Snf1p protein kinase fail to accumulate glycogen, a deficit that we attributed to hyperphosphorylation of glycogen synthase (15Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27907-27913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several second site suppressors of this glycogen phenotype, designatedssg1-5 (suppressor of s nf1 for glycogen phenotype), were identified, and the wild-type allele of one, ssg3, was found to encode Pho85p, a protein kinase catalytic subunit (11Huang D. Farkas I. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4357-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Another mutant allele, ssg1, also restored the wild-type glycogen synthase activity ratio to snf1 cells, suggesting that assg1 snf1 strain could have reduced glycogen synthase kinase activity. Also, the presence of the ssg1 allele in a wild-type background caused glycogen hyperaccumulation (Fig.1). Cloning ssg1 by complementation was complicated by the fact that transformation of thessg1 snf1 cells was extremely difficult, and we could not obtain sufficient numbers of transformants for effective library screening. Since ssg1 also complemented the glycogen defect in glc7-1 cells, which have an impaired type 1 phosphatase catalytic subunit (8Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we screened for loss of glycogen accumulation in an ssg1 glc7-1 ura3 strain (DH54-102) after transformation with a yeast genomic library (22Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). We isolated a plasmid that complemented the ssg1 phenotype and identified the responsible gene as PFK2, which encodes the β-subunit of phosphofructo-1-kinase (16Heinisch J. Ritzel R.G. Borstel R.C.V. Aguilera A. Rodicio R. Zimmermann F.K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 78: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we confirmed by genetic methods that the relevant phenotype was indeed linked to the PFK2 locus. Strains harboring deletions of PFK2 were found to hyperaccumulate glycogen in a wild-type background, and glycogen storage was restored to glc7-1 and snf1cells (Fig. 1). Deletion of PFK2 has been reported to increase glucose-6-P levels (28Breitenbach-Schmitt I. Schmitt H.D. Heinisch J. Zimmermann F.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 536-540Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and we therefore measured glucose-6-P in ssg1 and several other relevant strains. In wild-type cells, glucose-6-P decreases from about 2 nmol/mg, dry weight, during logarithmic growth to less than half of that level before the onset of stationary phase. Elevated levels of glucose-6-P were observed inssg1, pfk2, ssg1 glc7-1, andpfk2 glc7-1 cells (Table II). The double mutants ssg1 snf1 and pfk2 snf1contained less glucose-6-P than pfk2 cells but still more than wild type.

Open table in a new tab The glucose-6-P level is normalized to that in wild-type cells during logarithmic growth. The absolute value of glucose-6-P in wild-type cells under these conditions was 2 nmol/mg, dry weight, of cells. Since glucose-6-P is a potent activator of glycogen synthase, an obvious hypothesis is that enhanced glycogen storage by pfk2mutants is caused by this activation. In our initial analysis of glycogen synthase activity in extracts from ssg1 snf1 cells, we observed that the −/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio was significantly elevated as compared with snf1 cells (11Huang D. Farkas I. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4357-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, not knowing that glucose-6-P levels might be increased, we had taken no special measures in the earlier study to remove small molecules from the extract. Thus, there could have been carry-over of endogenous glucose-6-P from the cell extract into the glycogen synthase assay. For the assay in the absence of added glucose-6-P, this could cause increased activity and an erroneously high −/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio. Therefore, cell extracts were treated with a Sephadex G25 spin column to remove endogenous glucose-6-P prior to the assay. The −/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio in pfk2 mutants was still over twice that of wild-type cells (Fig. 2). In pfk2 snf1 cells, the activity ratio was restored to wild-type levels, whereas deletion of PFK2 in aglc7-1 background only partially restored the activity (Fig.2). This result indicates that the intrinsic activity, and by inference the phosphorylation state, of glycogen synthase was affected in these mutants. Since pfk2 mutants have elevated glucose-6-P, we explored the possibility that the high level of this metabolite caused the glycogen hyperaccumulation. Mutation of two other genes, PFK1 and PGI1, is also known to affect glucose-6-P levels, and we asked whether such mutations also influenced glycogen accumulation. Mutants defective in PFK1, which encodes the α subunit of phosphofructokinase, contain elevated glucose-6-P but less than in pfk2 strains (Ref. 28Breitenbach-Schmitt I. Schmitt H.D. Heinisch J. Zimmermann F.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 536-540Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar; see also Table II) and in general have a less severe phenotype thanpfk2 mutants. We found that pfk1 mutants did overaccumulate glycogen but to a lesser degree than pfk2cells. A pfk1 glc7-1 (DH57-0) double mutant was still glycogen-deficient (Fig. 1). However, glycogen accumulation was restored in pfk1 snf1 double mutants (Fig. 1), indicating that the defect in snf1 cells is more sensitive to the glucose-6-P level than the defect in glc7-1 cells. Similarly, the glycogen synthase activity ratio in extracts frompfk1 and snf1 pfk1 mutants was elevated beyond the wild-type values, whereas in a pfk1 glc7-1 strain it was still below wild type. Deletion of PGI1, which encodes phosphoglucose isomerase, prevents growth on glucose; therefore, pgi1 strains were grown in a fructose medium supplemented with trace amounts of glucose (YPFD; Ref. 29Corominas J.

https://openalex.org/W2082081646,"The functionality of the sequence Arg183-Gly184-Tyr185 of the substrate binding fourth β-α loop in the (β/α)8-barrel of barley α-amylase isozyme 1 (AMY1) was studied by random mutagenesis. A motif of polar Gly184hydrophobic residues was present in active mutants, selected by starch plate screening of yeast transformants. Gly184 was important, probably due to the carbonyl group binding to Ca2+ and the spatial proximity of Phe181. Mutation of both flanking residues as in Ser183-Gly184-Met185 (SGM-) and TGL-AMY1 decreased the Ca2+ affinity. SGM-AMY1 has 2-fold increased activity for amylose but reduced activity on maltooligosaccharides, whereas KGY-AMY1 has up to 3-fold elevated activity toward the oligosaccharides. TGL-AMY1 has modest activity on all substrates. Shifted action pattern on maltooligosaccharides for NGY-, SGM-, and TGL-AMY1 support that Arg183 in wild type is located at subsites +1 and +2, accommodating two sugar rings toward the reducing end from the site of cleavage. In the crystal structure of barley α-amylase 2 (AMY2), Lys182 (equivalent to AMY1 Arg183) is hydrogen-bonded with sugar OH-3 in subsite +2. Higher K i app for acarbose inhibition of KGY-AMY1 and parent AMY1 compared with the other mutants suggests favorable substrate interactions for Arg/Lys183. KGY-AMY1 was not inhibited by the AMY2-specific proteinaceous barley α-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor, although Lys182 of AMY2 is salt-linked to the inhibitor."

It belongs to the helical cytokine superfamily and is further classified as a short chain cytokine similar to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) (3Bazan J.F.

This helical bundle motif is completed by long overhand loops connecting the helices (loops AB and CD) and a type II turn (turn BC) between helices B and C. Distinct from the other short chain cytokines, the hIL-3 variant structure also revealed that loop AB contains an additional helix (helix A′) that is approximately parallel to helix D and interacts extensively with both helix D and loop CD. Furthermore, loop AB, which passes in front of helix D, has a threading topology that is more like that of the long chain cytokines such as growth hormone (8Abdel-Meguid S.S. Shieh H.-S. Smith W.W.

Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Binding to a cell surface receptor (IL-3R) composed of at least α and β chains is the initial event in the expression of IL-3's proliferative activity on a target cell. The α chain of this receptor (IL-3Rα) is specific for IL-3, whereas the β chain (βc) is shared with the related hematopoietic cytokines GM-CSF (10Kitamura T. Sato N. Arai K. Miyajima A. Cell. 1991; 66: 1165-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and IL-5 (11Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. derHeyden J.V. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). IL-3 binds to IL-3Rα with low affinity and has no detectable affinity for βc in the absence of IL-3Rα; high affinity binding requires the presence of both chains. Following the formation of the high affinity IL-3·IL-3R complex, signal transduction is mediated by the β chain. Although the precise stoichiometry of the IL-3 receptor has not been established, we refer to the receptor as a heterodimer for simplicity. Several approaches have been undertaken to define the regions of hIL-3 that interact with the receptor, including constructing interspecies chimeras (12Kaushansky K. Shoemaker S.G. Broudy V.C. Lin N.

These studies identified sequences important for activity in both N- and C-terminal regions of IL-3 and revealed many specific sites where amino acid substitutions lead to significant changes in receptor binding affinity and growth-promoting activity.

The recently available three-dimensional structure of an hIL-3 variant (7Feng Y. Klein B. McWherter C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 524-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) provides for the first time an experimentally derived model to understand the effect of these mutations. In this paper, the activities of hIL-3 mutants are interpreted in terms of IL-3's three-dimensional structure. Together these data define an IL-3Rα binding site on IL-3 consisting of the solvent-exposed surface of 10 residues located on helix A, helix A′, loop CD, and helix D. These findings are exploited to construct a molecular model of the IL-3·IL-3R complex structure. This model provides explanations of the mutagenesis results on the structural basis, suggests alternative ligand binding sites on IL-3Rβ, and proposes additional mutations for further investigation of the cytokine-receptor interaction. Recombinant DNA procedures used to generate the IL-3 variants have been described previously (19Olins P.O. Bauer S.C. Braford-Goldberg S. Sterbenz K. Polazzi J.O. Caparon M.H. Klein B.K. Easton A.M.

Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were conducted on a Jasco J500C at 20 °C. Samples for the CD experiments contained between 0.08 and 0.42 mg/ml protein in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate at pH 4. The percentage of helical conformation was estimated from the signal at 222 nm according to Chen et al.(21Chen Y.H. Yang Y.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Receptor binding affinity and cell proliferation activity of IL-3 variants were measured essentially as described previously (22Thomas J.W. Baum C.M. Hood W.F. Klein B. Monahan J.B. Paik K. Staten N.

Activity for each variant was reported as the concentration that gave 50% of the maximal response by fitting a four-parameter logistic regression model to the data. Relative potencies (EC50 of hIL-3 divided by EC50 of variant) are the mean of at least three independent assays. A model for the wild-type hIL-315–125 was generated from the energy-minimized average NMR structure of the hIL-3 variant SC-65369 (Protein Data Bank entry 1JLI). The mutated residues in the structure of SC-65369 were replaced with their wild-type counterparts using INSIGHTII (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA). These replacements were well-tolerated because nearly all of them occur on the surface of the molecule. The resultant structure was exported into XPLOR 3.1 (24Brunger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 803-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 25Brunger A.T. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, X-PLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), and 1000 energy minimization steps were performed while fixing the backbone N, Cα, C′, and O atoms. During the energy minimization, the electrostatic energy was included in the total energy, but the charges at the side chains of the ionizable residues, as well as at the termini, were excluded. Solvent-accessible surface area was calculated for each residue using the method of Lee and Richards (26Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar) as implemented in XPLOR using a solvent probe radius of 1.4 Å. Sequence alignment of the cytokine receptor motif (CRM) domains of the receptors was performed initially using the BESTFIT routine in the UWGCG Software Package (50UWGCG Software Package (1991) Version 7.3, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI.Google Scholar) and subsequently manually refined using the same package. Consideration was given to previously identified consensus sequence motifs (3Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar), secondary structure predictions, the locations of β strands and loops of growth hormone receptor (GHR) in the GH·GHR complex structure (Protein Data Bank entry 3HHR) (9deVos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar), and the locations of residues that contribute to the hydrophobic cores of the GHR domains. Specific reference points employed included the locations of conserved disulfide bridges in the N-terminal domain of GHR and the “WSXWS box” in the C-terminal domain. The initial coordinates of the CRM domains of IL-3Rα (residues 106–294) and βc (residues 244–439) were constructed by substituting the IL-3R sequences into the corresponding GHR structures in INSIGHTII. Extended loops were modeled from fragments of highly refined protein crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank and spliced into the receptor structures. The initial models for each subunit were exported into SYBYL (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO) where the side chain torsion angles were iteratively scanned for combinations that would relieve van der Waals violations. The structures were then exported to CHAIN (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) to improve the main chain geometry of the spliced loops. The resulting structures were further refined by energy minimization using XPLOR (24Brunger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 803-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 25Brunger A.T. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, X-PLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Initial energy minimizations were performed with all non-hydrogen atoms fixed and then repeated with all backbone atoms fixed. Subsequent full atom energy minimization employed distance and backbone dihedral angle constraints for β sheets to preserve secondary structure while still permitting side chain and segmental movements. The side chains were subject to 10 ps of molecular dynamics at 100 K and subsequently to energy minimizations with full electrostatic potentials for all atoms except for side chain atoms of ionizable residues and the termini. The model for the structure of the complex was generated through several stages. Initially, key mutagenesis data were used to identify putative complementary residues as tether points to place IL-3 in the ligand binding pocket. IL-3 and the receptor were then subject to rigid body movement tethered with distances from the side chain carboxyl group of IL-3 Asp21to the center of the charged side chain atoms of IL-3Rα Arg234, Lys235, and Arg277, and from the carboxyl group of IL-3 Glu43 to the center of the charged side chain atoms of IL-3Rα Arg145 and Arg146 constrained to be ≤5.0 Å. There is sufficient space between the two subunits in the receptor model so that no movement of the βc subunit was required when IL-3 is docked to the α subunit. Next, a full atom energy minimization of the complex (except for backbone atoms of IL-3Rα residues 211–294 and βc residues 343–439, sequences that are involved primarily in the intersubunit interface) was carried out using the same ligand-receptor distance constraints as described above. This minimization excluded electrostatic interactions, and it used distance and backbone dihedral angle constraints to maintain secondary structures in both IL-3 and its receptor. A subsequent round of energy minimization included electrostatic contributions for all atoms except for charged atoms of ionizable side chains and termini. At the final stage, the minimization was carried out with full electrostatic potentials for all atoms except for chain termini. The solvent-accessible areas buried upon complex formation were calculated in XPLOR using a probe size of 1.4 Å. The electrostatic potentials surrounding hIL-315–125 and the receptor were calculated using GRASP (27Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The Amber parameter set was used to assign partial charges. Dielectric constants of 80 and 2 were assigned to the solvent and the solute, respectively. The ionic strength of the solvent was set to 145 mm, the water probe radius to 1.4 Å, and the ionic radius to 2 Å. A charge of 0.5 unit was assigned to histidine side chains. Because only the CRM domains of the receptor sequences were used in modeling, the beginning and end of the receptor chains were left uncharged. An extensive screening mutagenesis study was carried out using hIL-315–125 as the template (19Olins P.O. Bauer S.C. Braford-Goldberg S. Sterbenz K. Polazzi J.O. Caparon M.H. Klein B.K. Easton A.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23754-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to identify amino acid residues important for biological activity. Libraries of single point mutants were created at nearly 90% of the positions using polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis methods. The resulting mutants were expressed for secretion in E. coli, and the secreted proteins were recovered after osmotic shock. Their bioactivity was measured using an IL-3-dependent cell proliferation assay, and protein concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The activities were evaluated for mutations at 97 of the 111 sites (with an average of eight amino acid substitutions at each position) to evaluate their tolerance to substitution. The results indicated that for >70% of the residues evaluated, substitution by other amino acids with a variety of size, polarity, and charge maintained significant level of biological activity. For the purpose of the following discussion, a residue is considered to be intolerant to substitution when, of at least three substitutions tested, no more than one had greater than 5% of the proliferation activity of the parental molecule. Residues that were found to have approximately half active (≥5% of hIL-3 activity) and half inactive (<5% of hIL-3 activity) substitutions are classified as partially tolerant. Residues where the majority of the mutations have >5% activity are considered tolerant. Using these criteria, the results reported previously by Olins et al. (19Olins P.O. Bauer S.C. Braford-Goldberg S. Sterbenz K. Polazzi J.O. Caparon M.H. Klein B.K. Easton A.M. Paik K. Klover J.A. Thiele B.R. McKearn J.P. J. Biol.

A total of 16 amino acid residues are classified as intolerant, and another 12 are classified as partially tolerant. Substitution-sensitive residues, consisting of both intolerant and partially tolerant residues, are distributed throughout the linear sequence of the protein.Table IAmino acid residues sensitive to substitution (see text) and conserved in mammalian IL-3 sequencesPositionClass1-aSensitivity to amino acid substitution: I, intolerant; PT, partially tolerant; T, tolerant; ND, not determined.SA area1-bIndicates the solvent-accessible area (in Å2) for the given residue in the three-dimensional model of hIL-315–125.Conservation1-cExtent of conservation at a given position: ch, chimpanzee; gi, gibbon; rh, rhesus; ov, ovine; bo, bovine; ra, rat; mu, mouse; ex, except.Cys16I20.6ex, ov, boIle20PT0.0ch, gi, rhAsp21PT68.4ch, gi, rhGlu22I81.9allIle23T0.7allIle24PT26.2ch, gi, rh, muLeu27I2.2allGlu43I128.4primateAsp44I22.7primateIle47PT7.2primate, ovLeu48I0.0allMet49PT111.6ch, gi, ta, maAsn52PT8.5primateLeu53I0.6ex, muArg54PT1.2primate, muAsn57ND0.0allLeu58I0.0allPhe61I0.0allAla64I12.1ex, ra, muLeu68PT3.3primateIle74ND10.4allLeu78ND0.3allLeu81I0.0ex, ov, boCys84I45.4ex, ov, boPro86T45.4allArg94I100.3ch, gi, rhPro96I54.0primateIle97PT8.9ex, muIle99PT7.9allGly102PT10.1primatePhe107ND1.3allLys110I2.5allLeu111ND0.3allPhe113ND49.6ex, ov, boLeu115I0.0ex, mu, raThr117PT16.7ex, bo1-a Sensitivity to amino acid substitution: I, intolerant; PT, partially tolerant; T, tolerant; ND, not determined.1-b Indicates the solvent-accessible area (in Å2) for the given residue in the three-dimensional model of hIL-315–125.1-c Extent of conservation at a given position: ch, chimpanzee; gi, gibbon; rh, rhesus; ov, ovine; bo, bovine; ra, rat; mu, mouse; ex, except. Open table in a new tab A model for hIL-315–125 was derived from the recently determined NMR structure of the hIL-3 variant SC-65369 (7Feng Y. Klein B. McWherter C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 524-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition to N- and C-terminal truncations of 13 and 8 residues, respectively, SC-65369 contains 14 amino acid substitutions (V14A, N18I, T25H, Q29R, L32N, F37P, G42S, Q45M, N51R, R55T, E59L, N62V, S67H, and Q69E) that were found to be localized at the solvent-exposed surface of the protein. Despite the number of amino acid substitutions, both biophysical and biochemical data (7Feng Y. Klein B. McWherter C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 524-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) indicate that the structural features of SC-65369 are relevant for wild-type hIL-3. In comparison to native IL-3, SC-65369 is fully active in both cell proliferation and cell surface IL-3Rα binding assays, and it has a similar helical content as determined by CD spectroscopy. 2R. Schilling, unpublished results. Residues that are sensitive to substitution may be so either because they are important for receptor contact and their substitution diminishes the complementarity required for optimal receptor recognition, or because they are important for structural integrity and their substitution deranges the structure, thereby indirectly distorting the recognition site. Correlating solvent accessibility with sensitivity to substitution is one approach to assess the role of an amino acid residue in protein-protein interaction. Solvent-accessible surface areas (SA) for individual residues in hIL-315–125 are presented in Fig.1. Fifteen out of the total of 28 substitution-sensitive residues in Table I are found to be hydrophobic (Ala, Phe, Ile, Leu, Val, Met, Trp). Met49 is the only hydrophobic and substitution-sensitive residue with a large solvent exposure (SA = 112 Å2). The remainder are largely buried inside the structure (SA ≤30 Å2). Among the non-hydrophobic residues classified as intolerant to substitution, Cys16 and Cys84 form the only disulfide bridge in hIL-3. Studies on both hIL-3 variants 3R. McKinnie and B. Klein, unpublished results. and mouse IL-3 (28Clark-Lewis I. Hood L. Kent S.B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7897-7901Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) indicated that this disulfide bond is required for bioactivity and may do so by stabilizing the tertiary structure. In addition to the above residues, five of the substitution-sensitive yet hydrophilic residues (Asp44, Asn52, Arg54, Lys110, and Thr117) are also buried in the structure (Fig. 1 and Table I). These residues are likely to stabilize the structure through internal salt bridging and/or hydrogen bonding interactions (see below). While greater than two-thirds of the substitution-sensitive residues are involved in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of hIL-3, six (Asp21, Glu22, Glu43, Met49, Arg94, and Pro96) have significant solvent-accessible area (>50 Å2) and are good candidates for being involved in direct contacts with the receptor. To confirm the results of the screening mutagenesis studies and to test the effect of the mutations on receptor binding properties, several point mutants were selected for purification and full characterization. Mutants were chosen on the basis of their sensitivity to substitution, solvent accessibility, and location in the three-dimensional structure (TableII). The genes encoding the point mutants were transferred to an E. coli cytoplasmic expression system, expressed, and purified to homogeneity. To rule out the possibility that structural perturbation leads to the loss of activity, seven of the mutants (G42A, G42D, E43N, D44A, E50D, F113Y, and K116W), along with the parental molecule hIL-315–125, were characterized using far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. All of the variants had a helical content of ∼40% that was indistinguishable from that of hIL-315–125 and was also consistent with the solution structure of SC-65369 (6Feng Y. Klein B.K. Vu L. Aykent S. McWherter C.A. Biochemisty. 1995; 34: 6540-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the mutants are properly folded with no large scale changes in global conformation.Table IIRelative activities of a selected set of purified hIL-3 variantsPositionSubstitutionRelative binding2-aLow affinity binding (α receptor subunit only) measured relative to hIL-31–133.Relative AML activity2-bCell proliferation activity expressed relative to hIL-31–133.hIL-315–1251.72.52-cData from Olins et al.

Physiol. 1987; 393: 595-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), in L-cells coexpression with the β1a subunit, especially at high levels, makes the expressed channel insensitive to the calcium channel dihydropyridine agonist Bay K 8644 (12Varadi G.

Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), these subunits do not stimulate skeletal muscle α1S currents.

Recently, an α1S was expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, but currents were still not detected in most cells in the absence of the agonist Bay K 8644 (17Johnson B.D. Brousal J.P. Peterson B.Z.

The cRNAs at the 1 × level for the β subunits were (in ng): 3 β1a, 3.3 β1b, 6.5 β2, 4.2 β3, and 6 β4. Oocytes were incubated in 0.5 × L15 medium (Sigma) at 19 °C for 3–5 days before two electrode voltage clamp recording in a bath solution composed of (in mm): 40 Ba(OH)2, 50 NaOH, 1 KOH, 0.5 niflumic acid, 0.1 EGTA, and 5 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.45 with methanesulfonate) (28Perez-Reyes E.

Electrodes (0.5–2 mΩ) were filled with 3m KCl in 1% agarose. Cells were held at −80 mV, and test pulses were 500 ms. Leak current was subtracted online with a P/4 protocol. Data were filtered at 500 Hz before analysis. Reverse transcription reactions using 1 μg of poly(A)+-selected RNA and a ratio of 1 μg primer/μg RNA were done according to Promega Technical Bulletin 502. The 50-μl PCR reaction mixture contained: 0.2 mm each dNTP, 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μm each primer, 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and 0.1 μl of reverse transcription reaction. Following an initial treatment for 2 min at 94 °C, the following cycle was repeated 35 times: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Final extension was 10 min at 72 °C. β1a and β1b are alternatively spliced isoforms of the β1 subunit. β1a is found predominantly in skeletal muscle (3Hofmann F. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), whereas β1b is found in brain (3Hofmann F. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). As a positive control, both isoforms are shown to stimulate calcium channel currents when the cardiac α1CΔN60 subunit is expressed inXenopus oocytes (Fig.1 A). As reported previously, no significant barium currents are detected when the skeletal muscle α1S subunit is coexpressed with β1a and the other subunits (α2δ and γ) (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether interaction with other β isoforms stimulates skeletal muscle α1S current expression, we coexpressed α1S, α2δ, and γ with β1b, the brain β isoform. Surprisingly, appreciable barium currents (293 ± 24 nA, n = 15,V test = 30 mV) were detected 3–5 days after cRNA injection (Fig. 1 C). This current activates slowly (τ = 33.7 ± 3.3 ms, n = 15, Vtest = 30 mV), which is typical for skeletal muscle l-type calcium channels (31Donaldson P.L. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 82: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, endogenous currents (recorded from cells injected with β1b, α2δ, and γ but not α1) are much smaller and activate much faster (Fig. 1,B and C), making it unlikely that the detected current from the α1S/β1b/α2δ/γ combination is a contamination. Like skeletal muscle calcium channel currents (17Johnson B.D. Brousal J.P. Peterson B.Z. Gallombardo P.A. Hockerman G.H. Lai Y. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the expressed current is sensitive to 1 μm (−) Bay K 8644, a calcium channel agonist (data not shown). Thus, we have defined, for the first time, conditions for recording calcium channel currents from skeletal muscle DHPRs expressed in Xenopusoocytes and have shown a differential effect of β1 splice isoforms on this DHPR. In skeletal muscle, the majority of α1S is a truncated form, presumably formed by post-translational proteolytic processing (1Catterall W.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 871-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 32De Jongh K.S. Merrick D.K. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine whether the truncated form also expresses calcium channel currents inXenopus oocytes, we constructed α1SΔC1698, truncated at amino acid 1698, where the proteolytic processing most likely occurs in vivo (33De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Colvin A.A. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10778-10782Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When the truncated form is coexpressed with α2δ, γ, and β1a, little or no current (<100 nA) is detected (Fig.2, A and B). However, in the presence of β1b, currents are readily detectable 3 days after injection (Fig. 2, A andB). The maximum currents from the truncated α1SΔC1698 (2.2 ± 0.2 μA, n = 37) are significantly larger than those from the full-length form (0.3 ± 0.02 μA, n = 15). With the truncated form, currents as large as 6 μA are found 7 days after cRNA injection (data not shown). Consistent with the pharmacological properties of skeletal muscle calcium channels, the expressed currents are blocked by 10 μm nifedipine, a dihydropyridine antagonist (data not shown). Four β subunit genes have been cloned from vertebrates (34Castellano A. Perez-Reyes E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As others have shown (34Castellano A. Perez-Reyes E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), all β subunits significantly increase the current generated from coexpression with cardiac α1C and α2δ (data not shown). To test if coexpression of α1S with these other β subunits can also reconstitute skeletal muscle calcium channels in Xenopus oocytes, we coexpressed β2, β3, or β4with α1SΔC1698, α2δ, and γ. In contrast to β1b, the coexpression of β2, β3, or β4 produces no detectable (or very small) barium currents (Fig. 2 C) even when a 5-fold molar excess of β subunit cRNA is injected (Fig. 2 D). Skeletal muscle calcium channels are composed of the main pore-forming α1 subunit and the auxiliary subunits α2δ, β, and γ (35Isom L.L. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). We recorded from oocytes expressing different subunit combinations to test if α1S currents are enhanced by other auxiliary subunits. Our results (Fig. 3) show that in addition to the β subunit, the α2δ subunit also significantly enhances the expressed currents (cf., Fig. 3,A and C). The γ subunit does not have much effect on the expressed current level (Figs. 3, A andB). Our data show that β1b is unique in its ability to stimulate functional expression of skeletal calcium channel α1 subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Does β1b play a role in vivo in expression of calcium currents in skeletal muscle? If so, then it should be expressed in that tissue. Previous reports showed that β1a is the major β isoform in skeletal muscle (3Hofmann F. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To determine whether β1b is also present, we probed a Northern blot from rat skeletal muscle with probe N (Fig.4 A) that recognizes both β1a and β1b. Consistent with previous reports (24Ruth P. Röhrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E. Regulla S. Meyer H.E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Science. 1989; 245: 1115-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a 1.6-kilobase transcript (the size of β1a) is detected in skeletal muscle and a 2.9-kilobase transcript (the size of β1b) is found in brain when short exposure times are used (lanes 1:SkM and 3:Br in Fig. 4 B). After a longer exposure, a band the size of β1b (2.9 kilobase) appears in skeletal muscle mRNA (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). Another probe specific for β1b (C in Fig. 4 A) also recognizes the 2.9-kilobase β1b message in skeletal muscle (lane 5, Fig. 4 B). (The additional bands seen at 2.5 and 4.4 kilobase presumably represent additional β1splice variants not characterized in this study.) We calculate by phosphoimaging that the relative abundance of the β1bmessage in skeletal muscle mRNA is 2.64 ± 0.05% (mean ± S.D., n = 2) that of β1a. To test further for the presence of β1b in skeletal muscle, we did RT-PCR using mRNA from skeletal muscle or brain as template and primers (PF and PR, Fig. 4 A) specific for β1b. A PCR product of the size predicted for β1b (716 base pairs) is detected in rat skeletal muscle (Fig. 4 C, lane 2), although it is significantly less abundant than the product produced with brain mRNA (Fig.4 C, lane 4) as the template. We have reconstituted mammalian skeletal muscle calcium channel function in Xenopus oocytes. Because the slow calcium channel current is significantly reduced in the dyspedic mouse lacking ryanodine receptors (18Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 37Fleig A. Takeshima H. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1996; 496.2: 339-345Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that the difficulty in functionally reconstituting the skeletal muscle calcium channels in nonmuscle cells was due to a missing interaction between dihydropyridine receptors and ryanodine receptors. Although we cannot rule out a possible interaction of our expressed DHPRs withXenopus ryanodine receptors, our results point to an essential role for the β subunit. Our finding that a β subunit dramatically increases the expressed current is similar to its effect on cardiac calcium channels (15Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) but seems to contradict previous expression studies in L-cells where coexpression of the β1a subunit did not increase the current even though drug binding and α1S membrane protein was increased (11Lacerda A.E. Kim H.S. Ruth P. Perez-Reyes E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Birnbaumer L. Brown A.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12Varadi G. Lory P. Schultz D. Varadi M.

Commun. 1995; 211: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The major difference between our study and the one in L-cells (11Lacerda A.E. Kim H.S. Ruth P. Perez-Reyes E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Birnbaumer L. Brown A.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,12Varadi G. Lory P. Schultz D. Varadi M. Schwartz A.

Commun. 1995; 211: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) is the β1 subunit isoform used. We used β1b, whereas the L-cell study used β1a. Our demonstration of the importance of the β subunit in skeletal muscle calcium channel function agrees with results in knock-out mice where disruption of the β1 subunit gene led to a dramatic reduction of both the α1S membrane protein and the slow calcium channel current (38Gregg R.G. Messing A. Strube C. Beurg M. Moss R. Behan M. Sukhareva M. Haynes S. Powell J.A. Coronado R. Powers P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13961-13966Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 39Strube C. Beurg M. Powers P.A. Gregg R.G. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2531-2543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle we found that the ratio of β1a to β1b mRNAs is 100:2.6. The ratio of these two proteins in skeletal muscle and their relative affinities for α1S are unknown. Our experiments describe the effects of β1a and β1b individually on expression of skeletal muscle calcium channel currents in oocytes. Conditions for current expression in actual muscle may differ from those we describe for oocytes. Along these lines it will be interesting to determine whether β1b can outcompete β1a for interaction with α1S. Such information may aid in understanding the importance of β1 isoforms in the in vivo function of dihydropyridine receptors as voltage sensors and as voltage-activated calcium channels. The β1a and β1b used in this study differ at many sites. There are major sequence differences in the middle region (which separates the two highly conserved domains I and II, Fig.4 A) and also in the C terminus (24Ruth P. Röhrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E. Regulla S. Meyer H.E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Science. 1989; 245: 1115-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) beginning ∼32 amino acids after the end of Domain II. In addition, even within the conserved regions there are isolated, single amino acid differences (indicated by the small arrows under β1a in Fig. 4 A). There are two amino acid differences in the N terminus, three in Domain I, two in the conserved part of the C terminus immediately adjacent to Domain II, and five in Domain II itself (four of which lie at the very beginning of Domain II in or near the beta interaction domain (40De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12056-12064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)). Studies are underway to determine the molecular site(s) responsible for the differential effects of the β subunit isoforms on α1S expression. The skeletal muscle α1S has two forms presumably generated by proteolytic processing: the less abundant full-length form and the more abundant truncated one (33De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Colvin A.A. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10778-10782Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The difference in function of these two forms has been elusive. The injection of cDNA constructs encoding the full-length form or a truncated form into dysgenic myocytes lacking α1S restores both the excitation-contraction coupling and slow calcium channel currents (41Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Tanabe T. Nature. 1992; 360: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This rescue experiment fails to reveal any functional differences between the two forms, presumably because the protein product from the full-length form can be cleaved into the truncated form in the myocytes. Our study in Xenopus oocytes, which may not have the same proteolytic cleavage machinery found in skeletal muscle, suggests a significant functional difference between these two forms, with the truncated form yielding much larger currents. This is reminiscent of cardiac α1C where deletion of up to 70% of the C terminus increases the channel current (42Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With three cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation consensus sites in the C terminus removed in the truncated form of α1S, the two isoforms have different phosphorylation patterns (43Rotman E.I. De Jongh K.S. Florio V. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16100-16105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to reconstitute both forms inXenopus oocytes will allow a determination of whether their function is differentially regulated by protein phosphorylation."

Previously, we reported that Escherichia coli flavodoxin (Fld), a soluble electron transfer protein, directly interacts with bovine cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (P450c17) and donates electrons to this enzyme when reconstituted with NADPH-ferredoxin (flavodoxin) reductase (FNR) (Jenkins, C. M., and Waterman, M. R. (1994)J. Biol. Chem. 269, 27401–27408). To investigate whether flavodoxins can serve as useful models of the analogous domain in P450 reductase, we have examined the FNR-Fld system from the cyanobacterium Anabaena. Mutagenesis of two acidicAnabaena Fld residues (D144A and E145A) significantly decreased flavodoxin-supported P450c17 progesterone 17α-hydroxylase activity. Specifically, D144A exhibited only 15% of the activity of wild-type Fld, whereas the adjacent mutation, E145A, caused a 40% loss in activity. P450-dependent hydrogen peroxide/superoxide production by wild-type FNR-Fld was measurably higher than that generated by FNR-D144A or FNR-E145A, indicating that the mutations do not lead to P450 heme-mediated electron uncoupling. Interestingly, the D144A and E145A mutants bind with equal or even greater affinity to P450c17 than wild-type Fld. Furthermore, these mutations (D144A and E145A) actually increased cytochrome c reductase activity (35 and 100% higher than wild type). Anabaena Fld residues Asp144 and Glu145 align closely with rat P450 reductase residue Asp208, which has been shown by mutagenesis to be important in electron transfer to P4502B1 but not to cytochrome c (Shen, A. L., and Kasper, C. B. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 27475–27480). Thus, these residues in flavodoxins and P450 reductase appear to have similar functions in P450 recognition and/or electron transfer, supporting the hypothesis that flavodoxins represent valid models for the FMN-binding domain of P450 reductase.

Tollin G Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 389-426Google Scholar). The FMN cofactor functions as the redox center of flavodoxins, allowing these proteins to serve as low potential electron shuttles in several important, biologically diverse reactions.

Most conserved residues in alignments between Flds and P450 reductase, for instance, lie within regions that bind FMN. In addition, clusters of negatively charged residues exist in these proteins, which have been proposed to be involved in the recognition of specific positively charged residues on their corresponding redox partners (11Nisimoto Y. Otsuka-Murakami H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5869-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Nadler S.G. Strobel H.W. Arch. Biochem.

Mutagenesis of residues within two negatively charged clusters of rat P450 reductase (Asp207-Asp-Asp209 (cluster I) and Glu213-Glu-Asp215 (cluster II) by Shen and Kasper (15Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27475-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that these clusters are distinct from one another with respect to their interaction with the electron acceptors cytochrome P4502B1 and cytochrome c (cyt c). In particular, substitution of Asn for Asp208 significantly decreased the rate of P4502B1-catalyzed benzphetamineN-demethylation without affecting cyt creduction, whereas substitution of Gln for Glu213 decreased the rate of cyt c reduction without altering P4502B1N-demethylation activity. In the course of investigating the ability of a FNR-Fld system from Anabaena to support P450c17-catalyzed 17α-hydroxylation of progesterone, we have found a strong similarity between the results obtained with two mutant Flds, D144A and E145A, and the results from the study of cluster I in P450 reductase. These mutants, in combination with FNR, are considerably less efficient than wild-type Fld in reconstituting P450c17 activity, whereas conversely, their ability to reduce cyt c has been increased. Importantly, Anabaena Fld residues Asp144 and Glu145 correspond to Asp208 and Asp209, respectively, in rat P450 reductase. Spectrophotometric binding experiments indicate that mutagenesis of Asp144 or Glu145 to alanine has no effect or actually decreases the apparent K s of these Flds for P450c17 relative to wild-type Fld. This result is consistent with the Shen and Kaspers observation that theK m of P450 reductase for P4502B1 was not changed in Asn208 even though electron transfer was significantly affected either directly or indirectly. From these results, we propose that the study of flavodoxin-P450 interactions and electron transfer may yield important information about analogous P450 reductase/P450 processes. Site-directed mutagenesis ofAnabaena Fld was performed as described previously (16Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Genzor C.G. Cheddar G. Fillat M.F. de la Rosa M.A. Gómez-Moreno C. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K.

Wild-type Anabaena flavodoxin was purified as described previously (17Genzor C.G. Beldarraı́n A. Gómez-Moreno C. López-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Sancho J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified bovine P450c17 (1.3 μm) andAnabaena FNR (0.2 μm) were preincubated (25 °C for 2 min) with varied amounts of Anabaena Fld in reconstitution buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml dilauryl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine, 3 mmglucose 6-phosphate, 0.6 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) containing [3H]- and unlabeled progesterone (100,000 cpm and 50 μm, respectively). Reactions (200 μl were initiated with NADPH (0.3 mm final concentration) and terminated after 10 min by vortexing with 2 ml of chloroform. Following evaporation of the organic phase, steroids were separated by TLC, visualized by UV light, and quantitated by scintillation counting. 50 μl of horse heart cytochrome c (7.5 mg ml−1), 10 μl of NADPH (6 mm) and 5 μl of FNR (2.6 μm) were mixed with different quantities of Tris-HCl 50 mm, pH 8, in a spectrometer cuvette (maintained at 25 °C). The reaction was initiated by adding concentrated mutant or wild-type Fld (final volume = 500 μl). The absorbance change was followed at 550 nm using 20 mm−1·cm−1 as the extinction coefficient of reduced cyt c. Spectral changes due to titration of P450c17 with wild-type and mutant Flds (initial concentrations = 360–443 μm) using tandem cuvettes were recorded between 350–450 nm as described previously (19Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except [P450c17] = 5.0 μm, [dilauryl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine] = 50 μg/ml, and [progesterone] = 50 μm. Fe2+-CO minus Fe2+ difference spectra of both the sample and reference cuvettes were measured after each titration to confirm P450c17 stability during the assay. P450c17 reactions were performed as described above except [3H]progesterone and, in some cases, P450c17 were omitted. Background H2O2/superoxide levels for each sample were measured after the addition of water instead of NADPH. Trichloroacetic acid (3% w/v, 100 μl) was used to stop each reaction. Samples were put on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. A solution of 7.2 mm ferroammonium sulfate in 0.7m KSCN (90 μl) was added to each reaction as well as to hydrogen peroxide standards. After 15 min at room temperature, the absorbance of each sample was determined at 480 nm (20Hildebrandt A.G. Roots I. Tjoe M. Heinemeyer G. Fleischer S. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology. 52. Academic Press, New York1978: 346-347Google Scholar). [3H]Progesterone was obtained from Amersham Corp. Progesterone was purchased from Steraloids, Inc. TLC plates were purchased from EM Separations. All other reagents and supplies were purchased from Sigma or VWR Scientific. After our initial observations that E. coli FNR and Fld can serve as a reductase system for bovine P450c17 (19Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether similar proteins from microorganisms other than E. coli would support P450c17 catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 1, P450c17 progesterone 17α-hydroxylase activity was also found to be dependent onAnabaena Fld in the presence of Anabaena FNR, P450c17, and NADPH. The maximum rate of P450c17 turnover withAnabaena FNR-Fld under these conditions is 2–3-fold higher than with the E. coli system but approximately 10-fold lower than with a 1:1 molar ratio of recombinant rat P450 reductase to P450c17. For the FNR-Fld systems, differences in theV max of Fld reduction by FNR using NADPH (5 s−1 for E. coliFNR-Fld 2C. Jenkins and M. Waterman, unpublished observation. versus 20 s−1 for Anabaena FNR-Fld (Fig.2)) or in the rate of P450c17 heme reduction by the different flavodoxins may account for the higher activity observed with the Anabaena system. Stopped-flow experiments with wild-type FNR and Fld indicate that the Fld semiquinone is predominantly formed after electron transfer from reduced FNR. 3C. Gómez-Moreno, unpublished observation.Thermodynamically, this is an expected result since the Fld oxidized/semiquinone and semiquinone/hydroquinone redox potentials in the electrostatic complex with FNR are −204 and −461 mV, respectively, whereas that for FNR (oxidized/hydroquinone) is only −340 mV (21Pueyo J.J. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1065-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that reduction of cyt c and P450c17 is mediated by the flavodoxin semiquinone.Figure 2NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity of Anabaena FNR in the presence of wild-type and mutant flavodoxins.

Ballou D.P. Massey V. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 266-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and by deletion mutagenesis of the FMN-binding domain, which abolished P450 reductase activity toward P4501A1 (23Smith G.C.M. Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Analogously, flavodoxin has been found to be absolutely (Refs. 19Jenkins C.M.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8380-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) required for P450 reactions supported by FNR-Fld systems. These results would indicate a functional similarity between the FMN-binding domain of P450 reductase and flavodoxins for electron transfer to microsomal cytochromes P450 as predicted by Porter and Kasper (10Porter T.D. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent experiments by Estabrook et al. (26Estabrook R.W. Shet M.S. Fisher C.W. Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) show thatE. coli FNR is not required for E. coliFld-mediated reduction of P450c17 upon electrochemical reduction of Fld. Thus, reduced flavodoxin possesses the minimal requirements to serve as a functional P450 reductase when electrons are transfered to the FMN cofactor. Chemical modification of Anabaena flavodoxin aspartic and glutamic acid residues has identified two regions of the protein that are important for the interaction with FNR (14Medina M. Peleato M.L. Méndez E. Gómez-Moreno C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Each of these regions contains a group of three carboxylate residues (Asp123, Asp126, Asp129, and Asp144-Glu-Asp146) of which four (Asp123, Asp126, Asp144, and Asp146) are highly conserved in all long chain flavodoxins. It was therefore proposed that these sites are essential for redox partner recognition (14Medina M. Peleato M.L. Méndez E. Gómez-Moreno C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Resolution of the crystal structure ofAnabaena flavodoxin to 1.4 Å (27Burkhart B.M. Ramakrishnan B. Yan H. Reedstrom R.J. Markley J.L. Straus N.A. Sundaralingam M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1995; D51: 318-330Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) has localized these regions within the protein. Specifically, the first group (Asp123, Asp126, Asp129) lies between two short consecutive β-sheets (β5a and β5b) within a long (20 amino acid) loop present in all long chain flavodoxins, whereas the second group (Asp144-Glu-Asp146) is present at the C-terminal end of β5b as part of a turn region (refer to Figs. 3 and4).Figure 4Amino acid sequence alignment betweenAnabaena Fld, E. coli Fld, and rat NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). Flavodoxin alignments have been previously reported (38Grandori R. Carey J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2185-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and P450 reductase was aligned using two highly conserved glycines (indicated byasterisks) found in all long chain flavodoxins as anchor residues. β5a and β5b refer to β-sheet regions in theAnabaena crystal structure (27Burkhart B.M.

The most profound effect occurs with the D144A mutant, which exhibits only 15% wild-type activity over a range of 1–15 μm flavodoxin. Similar mutagenesis of Glu145(E145A) also results in significantly lower (by 40%) P450c17 activity. Residues Asp144 and Glu145 closely align with rat P450 reductase residue Asp208, (Fig. 4) which, when replaced by asparagine, diminished the ability of this enzyme to support P4502B1 by 63% (15Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27475-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Substitution of Asp126 ofAnabaena Fld with an alanine had little effect on the ability of this protein to donate electrons to P450c17. The glutamic acid residue at position 67 present in helix α2 (Fig. 3) is positioned more distantly from the FMN isoalloxazine ring than the other three residues. Changing this residue to an alanine causes a 25% loss in activity in comparison to wild-type Fld. The roles of these mutations in the Fld-dependent NADPH-cytc reductase activity of Anabaena FNR are significantly different from their effects on P450 activity (Fig. 2). The D144A and E145A Fld mutants exhibited greater activity than wild-type (35% and 100% respectively), whereas D126A is 25% less efficient that the wild-type protein. These results are consistent with previous experiments showing increased rates of electron transfer from illuminated spinach photosystem I to the D144A and E145A Fld mutants (16Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Genzor C.G. Cheddar G. Fillat M.F. de la Rosa M.A. Gómez-Moreno C. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K. Yan H. Wong B. Straus N.A. Markley J.L. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Laser flash photolysis techniques were used in this case to measure the direct rate of electron transfer between the photosynthetic reaction center and the Fld flavin. Deletion of a negative charge at position 67 produced a drastic change in the ability of this protein to transfer electrons to cyt c, as indicated by the absence of saturation kinetics at increasing E67A Fld concentrations. This polarity in activities (P450c17 hydroxylase activityversus cyt c reductase activity) observed with D144A and E145A is not unprecedented in studies of electron transfer proteins. For example, site-directed mutagenesis of twoAnabaena ferredoxin surface amino acid residues (Phe65 and Glu94) dramatically decreased (by 4 orders of magnitude) electron transfer to Anabaena FNR (28Gómez-Moreno C. Medina M. Hurley J.K. Cusanovich M.A. Markley J.L. Cheng H. Chae Y.K. Tollin G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) but actually enhanced the reverse reaction by 1.5–2-fold, as measured by NADPH-cyt c reductase activity (29Schmitz S. Bohme H. Biochim. Biphys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 335-341Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Alignment of the β5 loop region of Anabaena Fld with the corresponding regions within E. coli Fld and rat cytochrome P450 reductase revealed a conserved negatively charged site within the β5b-sheet structure of Anabaena Fld (Fig. 4). This alignment takes into account the 20–21 residue loop insertion found in all long chain flavodoxins. From this, it would be predicted that the atomic structure of the trypsinized rat P450 reductase (39Kim J.J. Abstracts of the XIth International Symposium on Microsomes and Drug Oxidations, Los Angeles, July 21–24, 1996. 1996; : L-120Google Scholar) would resemble short chain flavodoxins that lack this insertion. Presumably, site-directed mutagenesis of this loop should have a limited effect on P450 recognition and electron transfer by Fld. Indeed, neutralizing an aspartic acid residue within this region (D126A) fails to appreciably effect Fld-mediated P450c17 turnover (Fig. 1). In contrast, Asp144 and Glu145 ofAnabaena Fld appeared to play key roles in P450 reductase activity as evidenced by 85% and 40% losses in activity upon mutation to alanine. Questions remained, however, regarding the ability of these mutants to bind and electrochemically couple to P450c17. To address the issue of binding, spectrophotometric changes in P450c17 upon flavodoxin binding were recorded and apparent K s values calculated (Fig. 5). The absorbance changes measured upon titration with wild-type and mutant Flds were indicative of a low-to-high spin transition of the P450c17 heme iron as observed with E. coli flavodoxin (19Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elimination of the negatively charged residues at positions 67, 144, or 145 ofAnabaena Fld did not disrupt the ability of these mutants to associate with P450c17. In fact, the apparent K s value for D144A is 3-fold less than that of wild-type Fld. The results of these equilibrium binding experiments between the oxidized Flds and P450c17 may be reflective of the dissociation rate (k off) of these proteins during catalysis. Thus, after transfer of an electron from semiquinone Fld to P450c17, ifk off is limiting, the steady-state rate of progesterone 17α-hydroxylation would be expected to decrease as in the case of D144A (and perhaps E145A). Indeed, loss of these charged residues may reduce charge repulsion, a process found to be important for P450 reductase-P4501A2 and P450 reductase-P4502B4 interactions (34Voznesensky A.I. Schenkman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14669-14676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Voznesensky A.I. Schenkman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15724-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, elimination of either the Asp144 or Glu145 carboxyl group may result in a flavodoxin·P450c17 complex whose conformation is more rigid and consequently less favorable for electron transfer relative to wild-type Fld. The need for flexibility of electron transfer complexes has been proposed for other redox proteins including cyt c/cyt c peroxidase (30Hazzard J.T. McLendon G. Cusanovich M.A. Das G. Sherman F. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4445-4451Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), cyt c/cyt c oxidase (31Hazzard J.T. Rong S. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), cytc/cytochrome b 5 (32Meyer T.E. Rivera M. Walker F.A. Mauk M.R. Mauk A.G. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), andAnabaena ferredoxin/FNR (33Hurley J.K. Salamon Z. Meyer T.E. Fitch J.C. Cusanovich M.A. Markley J.L. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9346-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As evidenced by the almost 4-fold increase in apparent K s, replacement of Asp126 with alanine may indirectly enhance charge repulsion, although not significantly enough to affect electron transfer. Since D144A and E145A Flds did not appear deficient in their ability to bind P450c17 nor to reduce cyt c, we decided to test whether these mutants were more uncoupled to P450c17 than wild-type Fld. One measure of uncoupling of the reaction would be given by the leakage of electrons toward molecular oxygen by either FNR, Fld, and/or P450c17 during catalysis. An assay in which oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) is followed would indicate the amount of reactive oxygen species, mostly hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, being generated in the mixture. We assume that, under the conditions of the assay, superoxide would protonate upon termination of the reaction with trichloroacetic acid (see “Experimental Procedures”) to produce HO2⋅ which would oxidize Fe(II). From Fig. 6, it is clear that in the absence of P450c17, FNR-D144A generates twice the amount of reactive oxygen as FNR-Fld. Presumably, this is a result of increased uncoupling in the transfer of electrons from FNR to D144A or simply electron leakage from the D144A semiquinone to generate superoxide. This could in part explain the observed 35% increase in cyt c reductase activity, since superoxide is able to directly reduce cyt c. It should be noted, however, that when HO2⋅ reacts with Fe(II), HO2− is formed and protonated to generate H2O2, which then oxidizes another Fe(II). Thus, the values in Fig. 6 cannot be precisely quantitated in terms of the number of electrons lost to oxygen. Nonenzymatic reduction of cyt c by superoxide (maximum rate = 60 min−1, Fig. 6), however, could not account for the total observed cyt c reductase activity (100 min−1 at 5 μm D144A, Fig. 2), suggesting that the D144A semiquinone exists long enough in solution to reduce cyt c. In the presence of P450c17, the level of reactive oxygen species generated using FNR-D144A is essentially unchanged (Fig. 6), suggesting that electrons are not being transferred to the heme iron. This is consistent with the loss in P450c17 activity (Fig. 1). In comparison, P450-dependent H2O2/superoxide production by FNR-E67A and FNR-D126A were essentially identical to that seen with FNR-Fld. These data are also consistent with the small changes in P450c17 catalytic activities (Fig. 1) in that electron transfer to the P450 heme iron leads not only to substrate turnover but also to uncoupling to reduce molecular oxygen. Finally, the 40% loss in P450c17 activity observed with FNR-E145A is accompanied by a comparable decrease in the amount of P450-generated reactive oxygen relative to wild type. In conclusion, the results presented here support the hypothesis that different structural features are required for flavodoxin to interact with a variety of different reaction partners (as has also been suggested for ferredoxin (16Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Genzor C.G. Cheddar G. Fillat M.F. de la Rosa M.A. Gómez-Moreno C. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K. Yan H. Wong B. Straus N.A. Markley J.L. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). For example, mutagenesis of specific amino acid residues in ferredoxin produces a drastic loss in the ability of this protein to exchange electrons with FNR but not with illuminated photosynthetic membranes (16Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Genzor C.G. Cheddar G. Fillat M.F. de la Rosa M.A. Gómez-Moreno C. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K. Yan H. Wong B. Straus N.A. Markley J.L. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The fact that different amino acid residues are required for the interaction with one reaction partner but not with another does not necessarily indicate that the electron transfer protein uses different regions to accomplish this, as has been proposed for plastocyanin (36Gross E.L. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 37: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Presumably, different sites on the surface of flavodoxin make contacts with different partners, as suggested by the contrasting results reported here with cytc and P450c17. The consistency between the effects of mutagenesis of corresponding regions within Anabaenaflavodoxin and rat P450 reductase (15Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27475-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that these analogous domains are very similar, and as a result, further study of flavodoxins may lead to a greater understanding of how these proteins interact with their multiple redox partners, including cytochromes P450."

In primary osteoblasts and osteoblastic cell lines, type I InsP3 receptor messenger RNA expression is decreased by 17β-estradiol and 1,25(OH)2D3 but increased by phorbol esters and serum (24Kirkwood K.L. Dziak R. Bradford P.G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1889-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that chronic regulators of cell secretory capacity may affect these changes through regulation of InsP3 receptor levels. As an initial step to help understand how InsP3 receptor gene expression may be regulated under different physiological or pathological situations, we have isolated genomic clones encoding the promoter and six of the initial exons of the human type I InsP3 receptor gene. The major transcription start sites are identified, and it is shown that the type I InsP3receptor gene promoter functions in human osteoblastic cell lines to regulate transcription of a reporter gene. Furthermore, it is shown that several chronic regulators of osteoblasts secretory activity affect type I InsP3 receptor promoter activity. Significantly, 17β-estradiol via the estrogen receptor down-regulates promoter activity, consistent with its effects on type I InsP3 mRNA levels in primary osteoblasts and osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells (24Kirkwood K.L. Dziak R. Bradford P.G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1889-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These findings are interpreted in terms of the potential mechanisms by which chronic estrogen treatment may affect osteoblast secretory capacity. Cells from the G-292 human osteosarcoma cell line (ATCC CRL 1423) were cultured in McCoy's 5a medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Experiments with G-292 cells were conducted in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum depleted of endogenous steroids as described (24Kirkwood K.L. Dziak R. Bradford P.G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1889-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Strobl J.S. Kirkwood K.L. Lantz T.K. Lewine M.A. Peterson V.A. Worley III, J.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5399-5405PubMed Google Scholar). G-292 cells have osteoblastic phenotype in that they express osteocalcin mRNA, bone morphogenic protein (BMP-7) receptor, and secrete interleukin-6 in response to interleukin-1β and other osteoblast secretagogues (26Kirkwood K. Higgins D. Rueger D. Bradford P. J. Dent. Res. 1997; 76: 342Google Scholar). Cells from the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line (ATCC CCL 240) were cultured and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 20% fetal bovine serum as described previously (19Bradford P.G. Wang X. Jin Y. Hui P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20959-20964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A human placental genomic DNA library in bacteriophage λFIXII (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) was screened by plaque hybridization (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (and 7.79–7.83, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 2.60-2.81Google Scholar) to obtain type I InsP3 receptor gene clones. Probes for the human type I InsP3 receptor gene were derived by PCR amplification of human HL-60 cell cDNA using primers based upon the mouse and rat type I InsP3 receptor cDNA sequences (7Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Mikoshiba K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5385-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,8Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primer pairs were numbered according to the mouse type I InsP3 receptor cDNA and included: p489s, 5′-GAG ACT GCC TCT TTA AGC TAT GTC C-3′ (489–513 nt) and p970a, 5′-CAG TTG ACG GAG TTG ACC TCA TTG C-3′ (antisense of 945–969 nt); p85s, 5′-GAG AGA AAG CGC ACG CCG AGA GGA G-3′ (85–109 nt) and p513a, 5′-GGA CAT AGC TTA AAG AGG CAG TCT G-3′ (antisense of 489–513 nt); and p85s, 5′-GAG AGA AAG CGC ACG CCG AGA GGA G-3′ (85–109 nt) and p255a, 5′-GCT CCT CTG TAG TCA GCT CCT TGG T-3′ (antisense of 241–255 nt). The p85s oligonucleotide was selected as the most 5′ primer in the cDNA because the reported mouse and rat type I InsP3 receptor cDNA sequences diverge upstream of this point. PCR products were gel-purified, subcloned into pGEM-11Zf(+) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and sequenced to confirm their identities. Type I InsP3 receptor cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer method and column-purified. For library screening, SRB/P2 host bacteria (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) were infected with the λFIXII phage and plated at 5 × 104plaque-forming units onto each of 10 150-mm plates. Resultant plaques were transferred in duplicate to Colony/Plaque Screen nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products). The membranes were prehybridized and hybridized according to manufacturer's recommendations using 5 × 105 cpm/ml 32P-labeled type I InsP3receptor cDNA probe (1 × 109 dpm/μg). Positive plaques were identified by autoradiography and selected through secondary and tertiary screenings. Purified phage DNAs were digested with various restriction enzymes for mapping, hybridization, subcloning, and sequencing. For analysis of the type I InsP3 receptor gene promoter region, a 3.2-kbXbaI/HindIII fragment containing 5′-flanking gene sequences, the first exon, and part of the first intron was subcloned into pGEM-11Zf(+). An internal 1.5-kb BglII fragment of theXbaI/HindIII fragment was subcloned and sequenced from both strands in its entirety using M13 and internal primers. DNA sequencing reactions were performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [α-35S]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). Sequences were analyzed using MatInspector version 2.0 (28Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Primer extension was carried out as described (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (and 7.79–7.83, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 2.60-2.81Google Scholar) with modification. A 25-mer oligonucleotide, p109a, corresponding to the antisense sequence of bases +109 through +85 of the reported mouse type I InsP3 receptor cDNA (7Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Mikoshiba K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5385-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (+37 through +13 of the later reported human sequence; Ref. 11Yamada N. Makino Y. Clark R.A. Pearson D.W. Mattei M.

J. 1994; 302: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol, ICN Biomedical Inc, Costa Mesa, CA) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified using Bio-spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad). The labeled primer (50 fmol, 4 × 105cpm/reaction) was allowed to anneal to 20 μg of total cellular RNA derived from either G-292 osteoblasts or HL-60 promyelocytic cells by incubation for 1 h at 62 °C in Superscript II reverse transcriptase buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing RNasin. The reactions were cooled to 46–48 °C, and then extended for 25 min by addition of dNTPs and Superscript II reverse transcriptase. The mixtures were subjected to RNase A digestion, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol/sodium acetate precipitation. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels alongside DNA sequencing reactions of the 0.5-kb human type I InsP3 receptor SacI genomic subclone using the same p109a type I InsP3 receptor oligonucleotide as used for the extension. The eukaryotic expression vector pCAT-Basic (Promega Corp, Madison, WI), which contains the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene but lacks promoter and enhancer sequences, was used as the parent vector in constructing reporter plasmids for the analysis of putative InsP3receptor promoter and transcriptional regulatory sequences. The 1.5-kbBglII restriction fragment, containing bp −1150 through +350 of the human type I InsP3 receptor gene, was filled-in and blunt end-ligated into the filled-in, XbaI-cut pCAT-Basic vector. Clones with the promoter in the forward orientation in front of the CAT gene were isolated, digested with PstI and SalI, and subjected to unidirectional digestion using exonuclease III followed by mung bean nuclease. This produced a series of constructs containing progressively larger deletions starting from the SalI site in the vector multiple cloning site and proceeding into 5′ end of the upstream region of the promoter construct. The resultant DNAs were ligated and used to transform competent DH5α Escherichia coli. Recombinant pCAT constructs were purified by Midi Kit procedures (Qiagen), sequenced to identify the extent of the deletion, and used in transient transfection assays. In some experiments, the 0.5-kb SacI restriction fragment including bp −359 through +153 of the type I InsP3 receptor gene was cloned in front of the CAT gene of the pCAT-Basic vector and used in transient transfections. G-292 cells were cultured to ca. 50% confluency in 60-mm2 tissue culture dishes, washed twice with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and then transfected with a DNA-LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) mixture according to manufacturer's instructions. Equal molar amounts of the various recombinant pCAT-Basic expression vectors (approximately 3 μg) were transfected along with a fixed amount (1.5 μg) of the pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega Corp.). Cells were incubated for 12–14 h with the DNA-LipofectAMINE mixture, washed twice, and then incubated with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Hormones and other test agent were then added. After 48–72 h, the cells were harvested, washed, and soluble extracts prepared by repeated freeze-thawing in 0.15 ml of 0.25 m Tris, pH 8.0, and used for determination of β-galactosidase and CAT activities. β-Galactosidase activity in 20 μl of each sample was determined spectrophotometrically as described (29Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. After normalization for β-galactosidase activities, CAT activities in the soluble extracts (usually ∼50–100 μl) were determined by incubation at 37 °C for 12–18 h with 3 μl of [14C]chloramphenicol (50–60 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), 5 μl of 5 mg/ml acetyl coenzyme A, and 0.25 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, in a volume of 150 μl. The mixtures were phase extracted and subjected to thin layer chromatography. Results were analyzed by autoradiography using Bio-Rad Phosphor Imaging and Molecular Imager Systems, version 1.4. Water-soluble 17β-estradiol, 17α-estradiol, tamoxifen, retinoic acid, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), were purchased from Sigma. Retinoic acid and TPA were dissolved as stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. 1,25(OH)2D3 was generously provided by Dr. J. Napoli (SUNY, Buffalo). The concentration and purity of the 1,25(OH)2D3 were assessed by UV spectroscopy with an absorbance maximum at 265 nm (ε265 = 18,200), minimum at 229 nm, and a maximum/minimum ratio of 1.80. ICI 182,780 was generously provided by Dr. A. E. Wakeling of Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, United Kingdom. Hormones and reagents were added from 2,000-fold stock concentrations. Equivalent volumes of vehicle had no effect on cell viability or CAT activity. Restriction enzymes and other DNA modification reagents were from Promega Corp. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). To study the regulatory elements governing the tissue-specific expression of the type I InsP3 receptor, a human placental genomic DNA library in a λFIXII host was screened for clones containing the 5′-untranslated and promoter regions of the type I InsP3receptor gene. Using a series of PCR-derived probes corresponding to the 5′ region of the human type I InsP3 receptor cDNA, five independent clones were isolated and characterized by restriction enzyme mapping, Southern blotting, DNA subcloning, and DNA sequencing (Fig. 1). Three of these clones (λ1-5-1, λ3-1-2, and λ5-2-1) were selected by their hybridization to a human probe corresponding to bp 489–970 of the type I InsP3 receptor cDNA (numbering is in reference to the homologous mouse sequence) and were shown to overlap as indicated. Three separate exons were found by restriction enzyme digestion and Southern hybridization of these overlapping clones. A fourth independent clone (λ124) encoding two exons was isolated using a human cDNA probe derived from bp 85–513 of the cDNA sequence (mouse numbering). The more 5′ of these exons, denoted exon 3, is at least the third exon in the gene and begins at base 241 of the human cDNA sequence (11Yamada N. Makino Y. Clark R.A. Pearson D.W. Mattei M. Guenet J. Ohama E. Fujino I. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ATG initiation methionine codon at nucleotides 257–259 is included within this exon. The clone λ5-1-7 was isolated using a human 174-bp probe derived from bp 85–187 (mouse cDNA numbering) of the 5′-untranslated region of the type I InsP3 receptor cDNA. Subclones of this λ5-1-7 DNA, including a 0.5-kb SacI fragment and a 3.2-kb XbaI/HindIII fragment were isolated by their hybridization to the same 174-bp probe. The 1.5-kb BglII internal fragment of the 3.2-kbXbaI/HindIII subclone was sequenced completely (Fig.2). This BglII fragment contains ∼1.2 kb of upstream nontranscribed DNA including a consensus TATA box element, the first exon, and part of the first intron of the human type I InsP3 receptor gene.Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of the 5′ region of the human type I InsP3 receptor gene. Nucleotide numbering is referenced to the +1 nucleotide (A) identified as the major transcription start site (arrow) by primer extension. 5′-RACE termination sites are indicated by asterisks and are located within the GGAGGA high homology region, shown initalics. The putative TATA box (beginning at −39 nt) isoverlined in bold. Potential transcription regulatory sites are also overlined and include steroid hormone response element (HRE), CAATT enhancer-binding protein element (C/EBP), AP-1 sites, NF-κB sites, and SRE.

The first intron is indicated by lowercase lettering.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The transcription start site was determined by primer extension and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE). The antisense primer, p109a, corresponding to bases +109 through +85 of the mouse type I InsP3 receptor cDNA (7Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Mikoshiba K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5385-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (+37 through +13 of the human type I InsP3R cDNA; Ref. 11Yamada N. Makino Y. Clark R.A. Pearson D.W. Mattei M. Guenet J. Ohama E. Fujino I. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was hybridized to and extended by reverse transcription of RNA from human G-292 osteosarcoma cells and human HL-60 promyelocytic cells. The primer extension (Fig. 3) identified an adenine (A) residue as the predominant transcription start site. This adenine is located 39 residues downstream of a consensus TATA box motif (TATATAA) and is referenced in the sequence as position +1 (Fig. 2). Results from three separate experiments using independently isolated RNAs from G-292 and HL-60 cells indicated the same major transcription start site in both cell types. A minor start site (C), also identified in both cell types, was identified at position −26 relative to the major start site and 14 bp downstream of the TATA box. Interestingly, the 5′-RACE analysis performed at 37 °C consistently yielded products shorter (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 2) than expected from the published human and rat cDNAs or from the observed primer extension products. Inspection of the DNA sequence immediately upstream and encompassing the 5′-RACE terminated sites indicates a conserved GGA-rich region, which may impart an unusual secondary structure on the DNA and prevent full-length extension. Successful primer extension through this region required temperatures of 46–48 °C; extensions at 37 °C were terminated prematurely. To determine if the 5′-flanking region of the InsP3 receptor gene could function as a promoter and regulate transcription in target cells, the 0.5-kb SacI genomic fragment (−359 bp through +153 bp) was subcloned into the promoterless pCAT-Basic expression vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After transient transfection of G-292 osteosarcoma cells with reporter constructs containing the SacI fragment inserted in the forward orientation in front of the CAT gene, CAT activity averaged 4-fold greater (n = 3) than activity in cells transfected with constructs in the reverse orientation (Fig.4). In G-292 cells transfected with the forward promoter construct, CAT activity was further increased by treatment with 1 nm phorbol ester (TPA) but decreased in cells treated with either 10 nm 17β-estradiol or 10 nm 1,25(OH)2D3. Both 17β-estradiol and 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased CAT expression when added together with TPA when compared with TPA alone. Transcription promoting activity of the 5′-flanking region of the type I InsP3 receptor gene promoter was also determined by transient transfection of G-292 cells with pCAT-Basic constructs containing the 1.5-kb BglII fragment (−1152 through +350 bp) or 5′-deletions of this fragment. These data (Fig.5) have been normalized and are reported as percent of activity relative to the −174 bp construct, which consistently exhibited the greatest CAT activity. The results summarized in Fig. 5 show that the longer promoter constructs (−1150 bp, −911 bp) had less CAT promoting activity that shorter constructs (−691 bp through −134 bp), and that even shorter constructs (−110 bp through −39 bp) had less CAT promoting activity than the −174 bp promoter construct. Significantly, CAT expression from deletion constructs including just the TATA box, as in the −39 construct, was greater than expression from the pCAT-Basic parental vector, whereas the slightly longer constructs (−54, −134, and −174 bp) that included a consensus NF-κB binding element and a serum response element had greater transcription promoting activity than constructs containing only the TATA box (p < 0.05, paired Student's t test). We have reported that treatment of human G-292 osteosarcoma cells and rat primary calvarial osteoblasts with estrogen decreases steady state expression of type I InsP3 receptor mRNA (24Kirkwood K.L. Dziak R. Bradford P.G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1889-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). That data were consistent with mechanism involving reduced gene transcription. Using the human type I InsP3 receptor promoter CAT reporter constructs, the regions of the promoter that might confer transcription repression by 17β-estradiol were investigated. Following transient transfection of G-292 cells with various deletion constructs of the type I InsP3 receptor gene promoter-pCAT plasmid, cells were incubated with or without 10 nm 17β-estradiol for 48 h and then assayed for CAT activity. Fig. 6 shows that cells transfected with the longer promoter constructs (−2.9 kb and −1152 bp) expressed relatively low CAT activity and 17β-estradiol had little affect on this expression. However, cells transfected with the shorter promoter constructs (−486 bp and −174 bp) expressed greater CAT activity, and this activity was inhibited 20–40% by 10 nm 17β-estradiol (p < 0.05, paired Student's t test). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of 17β-estradiol on type I InsP3 receptor promoter activity in G-292 cells might be mediated by the estrogen receptor, CAT expression from the type I InsP3 receptor promoter construct was determined in cells treated with 17β-estradiol plus the antiestrogen tamoxifen, the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780, or 17α-estradiol, the inactive isomer of 17β-estradiol. The data in Fig. 7 A show that 10 nm 17β-estradiol reduced CAT expression in cells transfected with the −357 bp type I InsP3 receptor gene promoter and that 100 nm tamoxifen did not mimic this response. However, tamoxifen did block the effect of 17β-estradiol. In this experiment, a slight inhibitory effect of 17α-estradiol was seen but this was not reproduced in the other experiments. In a separate series of experiments, the pure estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, was used. In these experiments (Fig. 7 B), 10 nm 17β-estradiol reduced CAT expression from the −357 bp type I InsP3 receptor promoter construct to 87 ± 2% (mean ± S.E., p < 0"
https://openalex.org/W2045489933,"Coexpression of the enzyme, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), has been shown to increase soluble and secreted IgG levels from baculovirus-infected insect cells (Hsu, T.-A., Watson, S., Eiden, J. J., and Betenbaugh, M. J. (1996)Protein Expression Purif. 7, 281–288). PDI is known to include catalytic active sites in two separate thioredoxin-like domains, one near the amino terminus and another near the carboxyl terminus. To examine the role of these catalytic active sites in enhancing immunoglobulin solubility, baculovirus constructs were utilized with cysteine to serine mutations at the first cysteine of one or both of the CGHC active site sequences. Trichoplusia niinsect cells were coinfected with a baculovirus vector coding for IgG in concert with either the wild-type human PDI virus, amino-terminal mutant (PDI-N), carboxyl-terminal mutant (PDI-C), or mutant with both active sites altered (PDI-NC). Western blot analysis revealed that both immunoglobulins and PDI protein were expressed in the coinfected cells. To evaluate the effect of the PDI variants on immunoglobulin solubility and secretion, the infected cells were labeled with35S-amino-acids for different periods, and the soluble immunoglobulins were immunoprecipitated from clarified cell lysates and culture medium using anti-IgG antibodies. Only coinfections with the wild-type PDI and PDI-N mutant led to increased immunoglobulin solubility and higher IgG secretion. In contrast, infection with the PDI-C and PDI-NC variants actually lowered immunoglobulin solubility levels below those achieved with a negative control virus. Immunoprecipitation with anti-PDI antibody revealed that heterologous PDI-C and PDI-NC were insoluble, even though PDI-N and wild-type PDI protein were detected in soluble form. The capacity for PDI-N to increase immunoglobulin solubility whereas the PDI-C mutant lowered solubility indicates that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal thioredoxin domains of PDI are functionally distinct in vivo following mutations to the active site. Furthermore, mutations at the active site of the carboxyl-terminal thioredoxin domain result in PDI variants that can act as anti-chaperones of immunoglobulin solubility in vivo as has been observed in vitro for lysozyme aggregation by wild-type PDI and PDI mutants (Puig, A., and Gilbert, H. F. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 7764–7771). Coexpression of the enzyme, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), has been shown to increase soluble and secreted IgG levels from baculovirus-infected insect cells (Hsu, T.-A., Watson, S., Eiden, J.

F. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 7764–7771). The baculovirus expression system has been utilized for the expression of a wide variety of proteins in insect cells (1Luckow V.A. Shuler M.L. Wood H.A. Granados R.R. Hammer D.A. Baculovirus Expression Systems and Biopesticides. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 51-90Google Scholar, 2Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 47-55Crossref Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, yields of the secreted proteins are often much lower than those obtained for nonsecreted proteins (3Shuler M.L. Hammer D.A. Granados R.R. Wood H.A. Shuler M.L. Wood H.A. Granados R.R. Hammer D.A. Baculovirus Expression Systems and Biopesticides. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 1-12Google Scholar). IgG antibodies are one of the many proteins that have been secreted in a functional and active form from the baculovirus-insect cell system (4Haseman C.A. Capra J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5zu Putlitz J. Kubasek W.L. Duchene M. Marget M. von Specht B.-U. Domdey H. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 651-654PubMed Google Scholar). However, a substantial fraction of the immunoglobulin is observed to accumulate intracellularly in the form of incorrectly associated chains and insoluble aggregates (4Haseman C.A. Capra J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Hsu T.-A. Eiden J.J. Bourgarel P. Meo T. Betenbaugh M.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This suggests that post-translational processing in insect cells may be unable to accommodate the high level expression of immunoglobulins (7Hsu T.-A. Eiden J.J. Betenbaugh M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 721: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has become evident that the proper folding and post-translational modification of nascent polypeptides in the cell can be assisted by additional cellular factors including folding enzymes and chaperones (8Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar). In the absence of sufficient levels of these cellular proteins, the polypeptides may fail to fold correctly or they may associate into aggregates. Improper polypeptide processing and protein aggregation can be especially problematic in baculovirus-infected insect cells since heterologous protein production can be very high during the late stages of the baculovirus infection, and synthesis of host chaperones and folding enzymes will be repressed during the viral infection (2Luckow V.A.

Folding and assembly of IgG antibodies in the endoplasmic reticulum is believed to be assisted by a number of cellular proteins including the endoplasmic reticulum-localized enzyme, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). 1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; PDI-C, human PDI mutated at the first cysteine of the carboxyl-terminal active site; PDI-N, human PDI mutated at the first cysteine of the amino-terminal active site; PDI-NC, PDI mutated at the first cysteine of both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal active sites; PDI-WT, wild-type human PDI; AcBB, the negative control baculovirus AcBB; JPLH, baculovirus containing the genes for immunoglobulin G; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; PDI-C, human PDI mutated at the first cysteine of the carboxyl-terminal active site; PDI-N, human PDI mutated at the first cysteine of the amino-terminal active site; PDI-NC, PDI mutated at the first cysteine of both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal active sites; PDI-WT, wild-type human PDI; AcBB, the negative control baculovirus AcBB; JPLH, baculovirus containing the genes for immunoglobulin G; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PDI levels have been observed to increase with the maturation of B cells (11Freedman R.B. Bulleid N.J. Hawkins H.C. Paver J.L. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1988; 55: 167-192Google Scholar) and with immunoglobulin synthesis rates (12Roth R.A. Koshland M.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6594-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). IgG includes multiple intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds, and chemical cross-linking reagents have been shown to generate covalent complexes between PDI and the immunoglobulins in hybridomas (13Roth R.A. Pierce S.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4179-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitrostudies have demonstrated that the presence of PDI can improve the reactivation yield of reduced and denatured antibody Fab fragments (14Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the coexpression of a heterologous PDI has been observed to enhance intracellular immunoglobulin solubility and IgG secretion from baculovirus-infected insect cells (15Hsu T.-A. Watson S. Eiden J.J. Betenbaugh M.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Expression of PDI has also been observed to increase yields of select heterologous protein produced in other hosts including yeast (16Robinson A. Hines V. Wittrup K.D.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PDI is a multifunctional protein that includes several structural and functional domains. The enzyme includes two thioredoxin-like domains, one near the amino terminus and the other near the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Each domain contains highly conserved motifs along with the active site sequence, CGHC. This sequence is important in catalyzing thiol-disulfide exchange reactions in vitroleading to oxidation, reduction, or isomerization of protein disulfide bonds (20Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 21Wittrup K.D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mutations at the first cysteine 2The “first cysteine” refers to the first cysteine residue in the amino acid sequence (C GHC) of either the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal active site.2The “first cysteine” refers to the first cysteine residue in the amino acid sequence (C GHC) of either the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal active site. of the active site in either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal thioredoxin domain will inhibit the capacity of PDI to catalyze thiol-disulfide exchange reactions in vitro (22Vouri K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30946-30952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutations at both initial cysteines reduce enzymatic activity to negligible levels (23Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). PDI also comprises the β-subunit of the tetramer prolyl-4-hydroxylase (25Vouri K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (26Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. McLean L.R. Spinner S.N. Aggerbeck L.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9728-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the α-subunits in insect cells in the absence of coexpressed PDI leads to aggregation and insolubility of these subunits (27Vouri K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, coexpression of a PDI mutant containing serine at the first cysteine of both CGHC active site sequences was still able to form soluble and active prolyl hydroxylase (α2β2) tetramers and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in insect cells even though this PDI variant could not facilitate disulfide isomerase reactions in vitro (25Vouri K.

PDI has also been observed to prevent aggregation of other proteins in vitro in a role comparable to chaperones (28Cai H. Wang C.-C. Tsou C.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Quan H. Fan G. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Conversely, PDI can facilitate the in vitro aggregation of lysozyme at select substrate and enzyme concentrations in an anti-chaperoning role (30Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active sites' cysteines are not required for the anti-chaperoning function of PDI (31Puig A. Lyles M.M. Noiva R. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19128-19135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) since mutation of these cysteines to serines leads to anti-chaperone activity at all PDI concentrations. PDI also includes a distinct peptide binding site near the carboxyl terminus of the protein that will bind peptides and unfolded proteins with a slight propensity for peptides containing cysteine residues (32Morjana N.A. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Noiva R. Kimura H. Roos J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol.

The relevance of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal thioredoxin domains to PDI's enhancement of immunoglobulin solubility and secretion from baculovirus-infected insect cells is not understood. Although the two active sites can function independently in vitro (22Vouri K. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7211-7217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the two domains do not possess equivalent catalytic activities or substrate binding affinities (23Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30946-30952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal active site sequences, wild-type human PDI and three mutants were expressed in insect cells. These PDI variants included serine mutations at the first, more reactive, active site cysteine of the amino (PDI-N), carboxyl (PDI-C), or both (PDI-NC) thioredoxin-like domains of PDI (22Vouri K. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7211-7217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of these PDI mutants with immunoglobulin G in baculovirus-infected insect cells produced substantially different effects on the immunoglobulin solubility and secretion. Although the amino-terminal PDI mutant enhanced immunoglobulin solubility and provided IgG secretion levels similar to those of the wild-type enzyme, the carboxyl-terminal variant (PDI-C) and N + C variant (PDI-NC) lowered both immunoglobulin and PDI solubility in an anti-chaperoning role. Hence, the two thioredoxin-like domains, when mutated, act significantly different in vivoin their ability to alter immunoglobulin solubility. The transfer vectors containing the human PDI and PDI mutants were kindly provided by K. Kivirikko (University of Oulu, Finland). The three mutants of PDI were generated by mutagenesis of one or both catalytic sites (22Vouri K. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7211-7217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used for the construction of recombinant baculovirus vectors utilizing the BacPAK Baculovirus Expression System (CLONTECH). The recombinant baculoviruses PDI-WT, PDI-C, PDI-N, and PDI-N/C were each constructed following co-transfection of Sf-9 cells with the appropriate transfer vector and the linearized wild-type baculovirus (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, AcNPV) (CLONTECH). Plaque assays were performed to select recombinant baculovirus by identifying plaques in low melting point agarose overlays. The construction of the AcBB negative control containing the gene for β-galactosidase but without PDI insert has been described previously (35Lindsay D.A. Vonderfecht S.L. Betenbaugh M.J. Eiden J.J. Virology. 1993; 193: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The recombinant baculovirus for immunoglobulin G2a, JPLH, containing genes for both the heavy and light chain subunits of an antibody directed against lipoprotein I of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was kindly provided by Horst Domdey (5zu Putlitz J. Kubasek W.L. Duchene M. Marget M. von Specht B.-U. Domdey H. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 651-654PubMed Google Scholar). Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells were maintained in monolayer and adapted to suspension. Suspension cultures were maintained at 27 °C in shaker flasks with 30 ml of ExCell 401 (JRH Biosciences). High Five (BTI-TN5B1–4) (36Davis T.R. Shuler M.L. Granados R.R. Wood H.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1993; 29: 842-846Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen) insect cells adapted to suspension were maintained at 27 °C in shaker flasks with 30 ml of ExCell 405 (JRH Biosciences). Cells were subcultured onto monolayers for infection at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. High Five (BTI-TN5B1–4) cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well) infected with recombinant baculovirus in 24-well plates were collected and disrupted. Methods for the disruption of the cells have been described previously (6Hsu T.-A. Eiden J.J. Bourgarel P. Meo T. Betenbaugh M.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing and denaturing conditions on a 15% gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining or by transferring onto a nitrocellulose membrane (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose sheets were either incubated with 1:2000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-PDI (Stressgen) antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody for detecting PDI or directly incubated with 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Pierce) for detecting recombinant IgG. Purified bovine PDI was used as the immunogen for the polyclonal anti-PDI antibody, which is known to cross-react with human, monkey, rat, mouse, and hamster PDI (Stressgen). Blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) (35Lindsay D.A. Vonderfecht S.L. Betenbaugh M.J. Eiden J.J. Virology. 1993; 193: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Insect cells were plated and infected in a 24-well plate at the density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well. At 44 h post-infection, cells were incubated with 0.5 ml/well of methionine-free Excell 401 media (JRH Biosciences) for 1 h followed by labeling with 50 μCi/well of Trans-labeled [35S]methionine and -cysteine (ICN Biomedicals) in methionine-free media. At the end of the labeling period, cells were harvested and lysed in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmEDTA, 20 mm iodoacetamide, pH 7.5, with freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)) on ice for 20 min. After clarification at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 12 min to separate the soluble proteins from insoluble protein and aggregates (38Haase-Pettingell C.A. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4977-4983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal rabbit anti-murine IgG (heavy and light chains) (Pierce) and Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) overnight. Beads were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed with 15% SDS-PAGE under reducing and denaturing conditions. The labeling medium was collected, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed with reducing and denaturing SDS-PAGE for soluble IgG. The radioactive bands were visualized by soaking the gels in Amplifier (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.) fluorographic reagent for 20 min. The gels were then dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 autoradiographic film. High Five cells infected in 24-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well) were starved with methionine-deficient Excell 401 (JRH Bioscience) at 44 hpi for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with 50 μCi/ml Trans-labeled35S for 4 h. At the end of the labeling period, cells were harvested, lysed, immunoprecipitated with polyclonal rabbit anti-murine IgG (Pierce) and Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia), and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE under reducing and denaturing conditions followed by autoradiography as described. High Five cells infected in 24-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well) were starved with methionine-deficient Excell 401 (JRH Bioscience) at 44 h post-infection for 1 h.

At the end of the labeling period, cells were harvested, lysed, immunoprecipitated with polyclonal rabbit anti-PDI IgG (Stressgen) or polyclonal rabbit anti-murine IgG antibody (Pierce) and Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia). The samples were then analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography as described. The films were scanned with Apple One Scanner (Apple Computer, Inc.). The scanned films were quantified by means of the image analysis and processing software NIH Image (version 1.49). This software permits the measurement of the density of a specified area. Baculovirus vectors containing wild-type human PDI and several mutant PDIs were created from baculovirus transfer plasmids kindly provided by Kivirikko and coworkers (25Vouri K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The PDI constructs utilized in this study are shown in Fig. 1 along with the particular modifications within the active site sequence. Each of the PDI variants includes a mutation of the first active site cysteine to serine in either the amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal thioredoxin domain. To verify expression of each PDI, Trichoplusia ni(BTI-TN5B1–4, High Five) (36Davis T.R. Shuler M.L. Granados R.R. Wood H.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1993; 29: 842-846Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) insect cells were infected with the specific recombinant baculovirus construct of interest for 3 days followed by cell lysis, protein separation on a 15% SDS-PAGE, and staining with Coomassie Blue stain (Fig.2). A distinct protein band at approximately 58 kDa was observed for the wild-type and mutant PDIs that was not observed for an infection with the virus, JPLH, coding for murine immunoglobulin G (IgG). Viral stocks of each of the PDI variants were then generated and titered to provide sufficient virus for coinfection studies.Figure 2Coomassie Blue stain. 15% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue stain shows the production of the PDI wild-type, mutant PDI proteins, and immunoglobulin G2a(IgG). High Five insect cells were infected with single viruses only.Marker, molecular mass marker; PDI WT, PDI wild-type; PDI C, carboxyl-terminal PDI mutant; PDI N, amino-terminal PDI mutant; PDI NC, PDI mutated at amino and carboxyl terminus; IgG, JPLH baculovirus coding for immunoglobulin G.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To provide simultaneous expression of PDI and the immunoglobulins, duplicate cultures of T. ni insect cells were coinfected with a different PDI virus in concert with the recombinant baculovirus, JPLH. High Five infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for each virus to ensure simultaneous infection of the cells by the two different viruses (39O' Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). After several days' infection, the cells were harvested, lysed under reducing and denaturing conditions, and the proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-PDI antibody or anti-mouse IgG antibody (heavy and light chain-specific). Shown in Fig.3 are the Western blots of the cell lysates for the coinfections with each of the PDI virus variants. A distinct protein band was detected for each infection using a PDI virus (Fig. 3 a) to indicate that the PDI variants were expressed and recognized by the rabbit polyclonal antibody. The antibody did not detect any PDI in the uninfected cells or cells infected with the control baculovirus (AcBB) to indicate that there was no cross-reaction with any native insect PDI. Also, an examination of PDI levels in the Coomassie gels (Fig. 2 and data not shown) showed that the level of heterologous PDI was substantially higher than that of most native proteins, which is expected due to the strength of the baculovirus promoter and the shut down of host protein synthesis following viral infection. Expression of significant levels of immunoglobulin heavy chain was also detected in Western blots using the anti-IgG antibody for all the infections (Fig. 3 b). The light chain was also observed although the levels detected were lower since the polyclonal antibody is not as sensitive to light chain (40Hsu T.-A. Betenbaugh M.J. Biotechnol. Prog. 1997; 13: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). There were some differences in the total immunoglobulin and PDI levels detected due to the relative difficulty in obtaining exact viral titer measurements for the equivalent coinfections. However, it is evident from the Western blot studies in Fig. 3 that synthesis of immunoglobulins and PDI was achieved in all four coinfections. After 2 days of baculovirus infection, a sufficient amount of heterologous PDI will be produced to evaluate its effect on immunoglobulin solubility and secretion (7Hsu T.-A. Eiden J.J. Betenbaugh M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 721: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Consequently, the effect of coexpressing human wild-type PDI or the PDI mutants on immunoglobulin solubility and secretion was evaluated in radioactive labeling studies. T. ni cells were coinfected with JPLH and baculoviruses coding for PDI, PDI-C, PDI-N, or PDI-NC. After 44 h infection, the cells were labeled in [35S]methionine- and [35S]cysteine-supplemented medium for short (30 min) and long (4 h) periods. Following labeling, the cells were lysed in buffer, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation, which is known to separate soluble proteins from insoluble proteins and aggregates (38Haase-Pettingell C.A. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4977-4983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble intracellular immunoglobulin proteins were then immunoprecipitated from the clarified cell lysate and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and x-ray fluorography. For both short (Fig. 4) and long (Fig.5, a and b) labeling periods, significant levels of soluble protein were immunoprecipitated from the High Five cells coinfected with JPLH and wild-type human PDI or the PDI variant, PDI-N. In contrast, the soluble immunoglobulin levels were significantly lower and nearly undetectable for the coinfections with the PDI-C and"

This laboratory previously reported that purified liver microsomal P450 cytochromes are directly inactivated to varying extents by HNE. We have now found a mechanism-based reaction in which P450s are inactivated by HNE in the presence of molecular oxygen, NADPH, and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. The sensitivity of the various isozymes in the two pathways is different as follows: P450 2B4 and the orthologous 2B1 are inactivated to the greatest extent and 2C3, 1A2, 2E1, and 1A1 to a somewhat lesser extent by the pathway in which HNE undergoes metabolic activation. In contrast, 2B4 and 2B1 are insensitive to direct inactivation, and the reductase is unaffected by HNE by either route. Recent studies on the catalytic activities of the T302A mutant of P450 2B4 have shown that the rate of oxidation of a variety of xenobiotic aldehydes to carboxylic acids is decreased, but the rates of aldehyde deformylation and mechanism-based inactivation of the cytochrome are stimulated over those of the wild-type enzyme (Raner, G. M., Vaz, A. D. N., and Coon, M. J. (1997) Biochemistry36, 4895–4902). Inactivation by those aldehydes apparently occurs by homolytic cleavage of a peroxyhemiacetal intermediate to yield formate and an alkyl radical that reacts with the heme. In sharp contrast, the rate of mechanism-based inactivation by HNE is decreased with the T302A mutant relative to that of the wild-type P450 2B4, and mass spectral analysis of the heme adduct formed shows that deformylation does not occur. We therefore propose that the metabolic activation of HNE involves formation of an acyl carbon radical that leads to the carboxylic acid or alternatively reacts with the heme.

Since the first target of the toxic products of lipid peroxidation would be expected to be membranous enzymes, this laboratory recently undertook a study of the sensitivity of hepatic microsomal P450 (see Ref. 10Nelson D.R.

A. 1995; 92: 3764-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The six purified isozymes that were examined were found to differ in the effect of this agent at various concentrations, with P450s 1A1, 2E1, and 1A2 being most readily inactivated. The present paper is concerned with a newly discovered reaction in which HNE undergoes metabolic activation by cytochrome P450 in a reconstituted oxygenating system containing molecular oxygen, NADPH, and the reductase. All of the P450 isozymes examined are inactivated in this mechanism-based reaction, but the pattern is strikingly different from that seen in the earlier studies on the direct effect of HNE, that is in the absence of NADPH and reductase. For example, P450 2B4, the phenobarbital-inducible isozyme (11Haugen D.A. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7929-7939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is unaffected by direct exposure to HNE but is the most sensitive of all of the cytochromes examined to metabolically activated HNE. This laboratory has been interested in the deformylation of aldehydes as a model for the final step in the aromatase-catalyzed reaction in which androgens are converted to estrogens (12Cole P.A. Robinson C.H. J. Med. Chem. 1990; 33: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and has shown that similar oxidative cleavages occur with purified liver microsomal P450s. The reactions include the conversion of cyclohexane carboxaldehyde to cyclohexene (13Vaz A.D.N. Roberts E.S. Coon M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5886-5887Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), of a series of low molecular weight branched chain aldehydes to the n − 1 alkenes, and of citronellal to 2,6-dimethyl-1,5-heptadiene (14Roberts E.S.

Our recent investigation on the effect of site-directed mutagenesis of threonine 302 to alanine on the activities of recombinant P450 2B4 (16Vaz A.D.N. Pernecky S.J. Raner G.M. Coon M.J. Proc. Natl.

Of particular interest, the deformylation of cyclohexane carboxaldehyde by the mutant 2B4 P450 to produce cyclohexene is greatly increased, which along with other evidence led us to conclude that the iron-peroxy species, rather than the iron-oxene species, is the direct oxygen donor. More recently, we have examined the mechanism by which a series of xenobiotic aldehydes bring about the mechanism-based inactivation of P450 2B4 (19Raner G.M. Chiang E.W. Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results obtained with the T302A mutant of P450 2B4, along with isotope effects and observations on the influence of aldehyde structure, indicated that an alkyl free radical produced upon decomposition of the proposed peroxyhemiacetal intermediate reacts with the heme and thus causes the observed inhibition. In contrast, as described below, our evidence on the nature of the heme adduct formed from HNE points to the involvement of an acyl carbon radical. Rabbit liver microsomes served as the source of purified P450 cytochromes 2E1, 2B4, 1A1, 1A2, 2C3, and 3A6 (9Bestervelt L.L. Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The concentration of the HNE stock solution, which was prepared daily, was determined from the absorbance at 224 nm (29Schauenstein E. Taufer M. Esterbauer H. Kylianek A. Seelich T. Monatsh. Chem. 1971; 102: 517-529Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A typical reaction mixture contained the following components, added in the order indicated: purified P450 isozyme (0.1 to 0.2 nmol), potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (12.5 μmol), and HNE (40 nmol) in a final volume of 0.20 ml. After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, the mixture was placed on ice and promptly assayed for catalytic activity in the oxidation of 1-phenylethanol to acetophenone (30Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6442-6449Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For this purpose, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (equimolar with respect to the P450), freshly dispersed DLPC (15 μg), 1-phenylethanol (5 μmol), and NADPH (0.5 μmol) were added in a final volume of 0.5 ml. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C the reaction was stopped with 0.25 ml of 6% perchloric acid, and acetophenone was determined by the method of Vaz and Coon (30Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6442-6449Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The activity of the P450 enzyme incubated with HNE was compared with that in a control experiment in the absence of inhibitor, and the results are given as percentage inhibition. The reaction mixture contained a purified P450 isozyme (1.0 nmol), reductase (1.0 nmol), DLPC (20 μg), catalase (100 units), superoxide dismutase (100 units), potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (17.5 μmol), HNE (140 nmol), and NADPH (0.35 μmol) in a final volume of 0.35 ml. The reaction was at 30 °C, and a 10-μl aliquot was removed at various time points and added to a solution containing 1-phenylethanol (5 μmol), DLPC (15 μg), phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (50 μmol), and NADPH (0.5 μmol) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Acetophenone was quantified by HPLC, and the percentage inhibition was ascertained by comparison of the activity with and without HNE present. To a solution containing P450 2B4 (1.0 nmol), reductase (1.0 nmol), DLPC (40 μg), phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (50 μmol), and HNE (400 nmol), NADPH (1.0 μmol) was added to initiate the reaction in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and then dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of the same phosphate buffer containing 10% glycerol. A portion of the mixture (100 μl) was injected onto a C4 (214TP54) column (5μ, 4.6 × 250-mm, from Vydac) and submitted to HLPC at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. A solvent linear gradient was programmed to deliver acetonitrile, aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid from a 40:60 to a 50:50 ratio over 15 min, then to 80:20 over 15 min, and finally to 100% acetonitrile over 5 min. Heme and heme adducts were detected by a variation of the procedure described by Osawa et al. (31Osawa Y. Martin B.M. Griffin P.R. Yates III, J.R. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Murphy A.C. Chen L.

The native heme, heme adduct I, and heme adduct II (a very small, unidentified peak) had retention times of 12, 18, and 30 min with absorption maxima of 398, 403, and 413 nm, respectively. Electrospray and MALDI mass spectral analyses were performed at The University of Michigan mass spectrometry core facility with a VG Fisons “Platform” single quadrupole mass spectrometer and Perspective Biosystems Vestec Lasertec MALDI Linear Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer with the laser set at 327 nm. Samples were introduced in 50:50:0.05 acetonitrile:H2O:trifluoroacetic acid. Individual P450 isozymes were incubated with 200 μm HNE for 15 min as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subsequently assessed for catalytic activity with 1-phenylethanol in the oxidative conversion to acetophenone. This is a useful assay because all of the isozymes so far examined catalyze the reaction. The results given in Table Ishow that P450 1A1 is by far the most sensitive to inactivation by HNE, followed by 2A10/2A11 (a mixture of two isoforms differing in only eight amino residues), with 2E2, 1A2, 2E1, and 2C3 being only moderately sensitive. Several other isoforms, including 2B4, undergo negligible loss of activity. In our earlier paper by Besterveltet al. (9Bestervelt L.L. Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3764-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), somewhat different relative losses in activity of the various isozymes were observed, and the results were found to depend on the HNE concentrations used. At that time we were unaware of the occurrence of the mechanism-based inactivation to be described in this paper. The experimental conditions under which the P450 cytochromes were exposed to HNE differ in several respects from those used previously, and the aldehyde was generated from the dimethylacetal by 1 mm rather than 1 m HCl. The stronger acid used in our earlier studies may have led to the formation of additional inhibitory products.Table IDirect inactivation of enzymes by HNEEnzymeInactivation%P450 1A154 ± 2P450 1A1 (rat)38 ± 2P450 2A10/2A1128 ± 1P450 2E217 ± 1P450 1A216 ± 2P450 2E1 (human)12 ± 1P450 2E110 ± 1P450 2C311 ± 1P450 2B40P450 3A60P450 2B1 (rat)0P450 2G10Reductase0The inactivation of P450 isozymes was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The source of the various purified enzymes was rabbit liver microsomes unless otherwise indicated.

The reductase was also exposed to HNE and subsequently assayed for catalytic activity upon supplementation with P450 2B4 or 2E1. No inactivation was detected (Table I), which provides assurance that the results with the individual P450 isozymes are not attributable to impairment in the ability of the flavoprotein to transfer electrons from NADPH to the cytochromes. In experiments not presented in which several of the P450 isozymes were individually exposed to HNE, similar results were obtained whether at the end of the reaction the mixtures were diluted 50-fold or dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol, before catalytic activity was determined. Therefore, the results in Table I are not attributable to a contribution of HNE to the mechanism-based inactivation to be described below. The extent of direct inactivation is linear with respect to time, as shown with P450 1A2 in Fig. 1, but the reaction does not go to completion. The inactivation was examined at 20 min as a function of the HNE concentration. The results in Fig.2 indicate that the impairment in catalytic competence correlates well with the decrease in CO-reactive P450. In additional experiments not presented, the typical 29% decrease in P450 1A2 treated with 400 μm HNE for 20 min resulted in only a 6% increase in P420, but the total heme as determined by HPLC remained unchanged. Furthermore, no evidence could be obtained by HPLC for the formation of a modified heme.Figure 2Decrease in spectrally detectable P450 1A2 and catalytic activity as a function of HNE concentration. The cytochrome was incubated with various amounts of HNE for 20 min, and the reaction mixtures were assayed for P450 by the ferrous carbonyl difference spectra. Activity was measured on aliquots diluted 50-fold before determination of the rate of 1-phenylethanol oxidation. The data were analyzed by linear regression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The NADPH-dependent metabolic activation of HNE was discovered with P450 isozyme 2B4, which, as described above, is unaffected by this agent in the absence of the reduced pyridine nucleotide. The requirements for this reaction are shown in TableII. The usual components of the functional reconstituted enzyme system in addition to P450 are required, including the reductase and molecular oxygen as well as NADPH. Catalase and superoxide dismutase are routinely included to avoid possible inactivation of P450s by hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and other reactive oxygen species formed in the complete system, but their omission was without effect on the results with isozyme 2B4. This and other isoforms were examined as shown in TableIII. 2B4 and the orthologous rat cytochrome, 2B1, are highly inactivated, and 2C3, 2E1, and 1A2 are more sensitive than in the direct (NADPH-independent) inactivation. In contrast, 1A1, which is the most sensitive to direct exposure to HNE, is inactivated to a lesser extent in the mechanism-based reaction. This was determined by including a control experiment in which NADPH was omitted and making the necessary correction. The reductase was also examined for possible mechanism-based inactivation. After incubation of the complete system containing P450 2B4 with HNE, the rate of 1-phenylethanol oxidation was determined in the presence of additional 2B4 but no reductase. Under these conditions reductase inactivation was negligible, thus providing assurance that the results with the various P450s in Table III are due to an effect on the cytochromes and not to interference with electron transfer from NADPH because of inhibition of the flavoprotein.Table IIRequirements for mechanism-based inactivation of P450 2B4 by HNESystemInactivation%Complete49 ± 3No HNE0No reductase0No NADPH3 ± 2Anaerobic6 ± 4No catalase50 ± 2No superoxide dimutase50 ± 2No catalase and superoxide dismutase52 ± 2The complete reconstituted system was as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with purified P450 2B4 in the presence of 400 μm HNE.

Additional P450 2B4 (0.3 nmol) but no reductase was added to the assay mixture for 1-phenylethanol oxidation. In view of the known relatively high rate of direction inactivation of P450 1A1 by HNE (Table I), a control experiment was carried out in which NADPH was omitted.

The time course of inactivation of the six P450 isoforms by 0.4 mm HNE in the complete reconstituted enzyme system is shown in Fig.3. A time-dependent decline in catalytic activity in 1-phenylethanol oxidation was observed with all of the P450s investigated, albeit at different rates; inactivation at 20 min was about 30% for human or rabbit 2E1 and rat 1A1, and 50 to 60% for the 2B1 and 2B4 orthologues. Isoforms 1A1 and 1A2 exhibit both direct and mechanism-based inactivation, and the rates required correction for those determined in the absence of NADPH, as shown in Fig. 4. The effect of inactivator concentration on P450 2B4 was also determined, as indicated in Fig.5. Inactivation increased with time in an apparent biphasic manner. Biphasic kinetics were also observed with 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin as substrate. From double-reciprocal plots of such kinetic data, the apparent K I andk inactivation were found to be 0.31 mm and 0.076/min, respectively, for the fast phase of the reaction (0–5 min). The corresponding values for the slow phase (10–20 min) are 0.75 mm and 0.02/min. The partition coefficients were also determined from the kinetic data. The values are about 80 and 70 for the fast and slow phases, respectively. Coefficients of this magnitude suggest that the activated HNE intermediate that inactivates P450 has at least one other metabolic fate.Figure 4Time course of inactivation of P450s 1A1 (rat) and 1A2 (rabbit) in the presence and absence of NADPH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Effect of HNE concentration on the mechanism-based inactivation of P450 2B4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With purified P450 2B4 in a reconstituted system, a heme adduct was generated during mechanism-based inactivation by HNE. A representative HPLC chromatogram, obtained by direct injection of the reaction mixture containing inactivated P450 onto the column, is shown in Fig.6, along with the appropriate control in which NADPH was omitted. The adduct was purified by HPLC and submitted to MALDI and electrospray mass spectrometric analysis to determine the molecular weight. The mass of 770 for the modified heme (adduct I) is 154 mass units larger than native heme, which has a mass of 616. These values are consistent with the addition of an HNE carbonyl carbon radical and the loss of a hydrogen atom from the porphyrin. Whereas the T302A mutant of truncated P450 2B4 is more active than the corresponding wild-type cytochrome in the inactivation by xenobiotic aldehydes (19Raner G.M. Chiang E.W. Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the reverse was found to be true with HNE. As shown in Fig. 7, the mutant protein is about 30% less effective in inactivation. In results not presented, the 4-hydroxy-2-nonenoic acid formed under the same conditions was identified by HPLC according to Hartley et al. (33Hartley D.P. Ruth J.A. Petersen D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); the mutant protein is about 34% less effective in this conversion. These findings, along with the molecular weight of the heme adduct, support our idea that P450 inactivation by HNE involves formation of a radical species associated with oxidation to the carboxylic acid rather than with loss of the aldehyde carbon by the deformylation route. The results presented establish a number of differences between the direct inhibition of P450 cytochromes by HNE described earlier (9Bestervelt L.L. Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3764-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the inhibition requiring metabolic activation. The latter reaction has a clear requirement for the presence of NADPH, molecular oxygen, and the reductase, thus providing a reconstituted system in which HNE undergoes oxidative mechanism-based activation. The isozyme specificity shows some similarity but also some striking differences. Whereas direct exposure to HNE has no effect on rabbit P450 2B4 or the orthologous rat 2B1, these cytochromes are by far the most sensitive of those examined to metabolically activated HNE. The reverse is true of P450 1A1, which is the most sensitive of the isoforms to direct inactivation but only moderately affected in the mechanism-based reaction. Several of the cytochromes are somewhat inactivated by both routes. Mechanistically the reactions are also quite different. No heme adducts could be detected upon direct exposure of P450s to HNE, suggesting that a reaction occurs instead with reactive amino acid residues in the protein. In contrast, the metabolic activation of HNE in the mechanism-based reaction described in the present paper leads to the formation of a heme adduct. The scheme in Fig.8 summarizes our present knowledge of P450 inactivation by aldehydes in the reconstituted oxygenating system and shows the requirement for protons in the active site for cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond in the oxenoid pathway but not for the pathway in which peroxo-iron is the direct oxygen donor. In the case of HNE, hydrogen abstraction yields the carbonyl carbon radical, which combines with the iron-bound hydroxyl radical by the widely accepted “oxenoid” mechanism (34Ullrich V. Staudinger H. Hess B. Staudinger H. Nineteenth Colloquium der Gesellschaft für Biologische Chemie: Biochemie des Sauerstoffs. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1968: 229-248Google Scholar, 35Groves J.T. McClusky G.A.

Macdonald T.L. Adv. Electron Transfer Chem. 1993; 3: 191-241Crossref Google Scholar) to give the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, the radical attacks the heme to give the adduct in which the carbon chain of the starting aldehyde remains intact. The 2B4 T302A mutant is less effective in acid formation and in P450 inactivation, apparently because of disruption of proton delivery. In contrast, in the case of the saturated and unsaturated xenobiotic aldehydes studied previously (19Raner G.M. Chiang E.W. Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), reaction with the iron-peroxo species gives the peroxyhemiacetal, which upon deformylation yields an alkyl radical that gives the olefin or alcohol with one less carbon atom than in the starting aldehyde. Alternatively, this radical attacks the heme to give the C n − 1 adduct. The T302A mutation results in enhanced activity in the formation of these products and in inactivation of the cytochrome, as predicted by the scheme in Fig.8. Since the P450 cytochromes play a primary role in the metabolism of chemical carcinogens and drugs, as well as in the synthesis of biologically important compounds such as steroids and retinoids, inactivation of these catalysts by the products of lipid peroxidation may be of considerable physiological significance. HNE was selected for our studies because it is known to be particularly damaging in leading to the pathophysiological effects associated with oxidative stress in cells and tissues. However, other products of membrane lipid peroxidation, including alkanals, alkenals, 2,4-alkadienals, and various hydroxyaldehydes, should also be considered as potential inactivators. Although the direct and mechanism-based routes for inhibition by HNE affect a somewhat different set of P450 isozymes, together they inactivate all of the purified cytochromes we have examined. Hochstein and Ernster (39Hochstein P. Ernster L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1963; 12: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) were the first to report that lipid peroxidation is coupled to the NADPH oxidase system of microsomes. More recently we showed that P450 2E1, the alcohol-inducible form, and P450 2B4, the phenobarbital-inducible form, are the most active of a series of isozymes examined in the reductive cleavage of fatty acid hydroperoxides to hydrocarbons and aldehyde acids (40Vaz A.D.N. Roberts E.S. Coon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5499-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 2E1 is particularly effective in the reduction of molecular oxygen to reactive species that may contribute to the initiation of membrane lipid peroxidation (41Coon M.J. Roberts E.S. Vaz A.D.N. Davies K.J.A. Oxidative Damage and Repair: Chemical, Biological, and Medical Aspects. Pergamon Press Inc., Tarrytown, NY1991: 726-731Google Scholar). In view of the activities of these two isoforms in particular and also of other P450s in generating lipid hydroperoxides and in their β-scission to aldehydic compounds, inactivation by HNE as a product of lipid peroxidation may provide a negative regulatory function. We are grateful to Dr. Gregory M. Raner for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2070873384,"Mutations in the presenilin genes (<i>PS-1</i> and <i>PS-2</i>) are linked to early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms by which these mutations cause the cognitive impairment characteristic of AD are unknown. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are involved in learning and memory processes, and reductions in choline acetyl-transferase (ChAT) activity are a characteristic feature of AD brain. We therefore hypothesized that presenilin mutations suppress expression of the cholinergic phenotype. In rat PC12 cells stably transfected with the human <i>PS-1</i> gene containing the Leu → Val mutation at codon 286 (L286V), we observed a drastic reduction (>90%) in basal ChAT activity compared with cells transfected with vector alone. By immunocytochemistry, a similar decrease in ChAT protein levels was found in the mutant transfectants. In cells differentiated with nerve growth factor, ChAT activity was again markedly lower in L286V-expressing cells than in control cells. We also observed reductions in ChAT activity in PC12 cells expressing the wild-type human <i>PS-1</i> gene but to a lesser extent than in L286V-expressing cells. The viability of cells transfected with either the wild-type or the mutant <i>PS-1</i> gene was not compromised. Our results suggest that <i>PS-1</i> mutations may contribute to the cognitive impairment in AD by causing a nontoxic suppression of the cholinergic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2025972448,"Mg2+-induced polymerization of type III intermediate filament proteins vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein was studied by transient electric birefringence. In the absence of MgCl2 we found a net permanent dipole moment, ∼45-nm-long dimers for vimentin, ∼65-nm-long tetramers, hexamers, and possibly octamers for both proteins, and 100-nm aggregates for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Controlled oligomerization occurred after the addition of MgCl2. Although the solutions contained (small) aggregates of different sizes, more or less discrete steps in polymer formation were observed, and it was possible to discriminate between an increase in width and length. At the first stage of polymerization (in 0.3 mm MgCl2 for vimentin and 0.2 mm MgCl2 for glial fibrillary acidic protein), the permanent dipole moment disappeared without a change in length of the particles. At higher MgCl2concentrations, structures of approximately 100 nm were formed, which strongly tended to laterally assemble into full-width intermediate filament structures consisting of about 32 monomers. This contrasts with previous models where first full-width (∼10-nm) aggregates are formed, which then increase in length. Subsequently, two discrete elongation steps of 35 nm are observed that increase the length to 135 and 170 nm, respectively. Possible structural models are suggested for the polymerization.

Many eukaryotic cells contain cytoplasmic intermediate filaments (IFs), 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filaments; TEB, transient electric birefringence; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; Ω, ohm; SI, sample interval. which are composed of proteins with a molecular mass of 40–210 kDa (1Fuchs E.

All IF proteins contain a central α-helix-rich region, consisting of approximately 310 amino acids, flanked by nonhelical amino- and carboxy-end domains, which are extremely diverse in size, composition, and charge characteristics. The α-helical regions of two IF protein chains assemble parallel and exactly in register to form a 45-nm coiled-coil rod with end domains of uncertain length (2Heins S. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell.

At the level of tetramers, essentially four alignments of the constituting dimers have been suggested: antiparallel in register forming a rod approximately 45 nm long, head-to-tail with slight overlap and antiparallel staggered in two different ways, yielding a rod length of approximately 65 nm. Together with other data (9Potschka M. Nave R. Weber K. Geisler N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Steinert P.M. J. Struct.

Moreover, we detected particles with a length very similar to that of staggered tetramers but with a much larger permanent dipole moment (6Kooijman M. Bloemendal M. van Amerongen H.

As mentioned by Heins and Aebi (2Heins S. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1994; 6: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) “the hierarchy of the three types of lateral dimer-dimer interaction is ambiguous in these models.” Furthermore, it is not clear what the exact number of IF monomers in filament cross-section is, this may be varying in different filaments and even within the same filament (2Heins S. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1994; 6: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Heins S. Wong P.C. Müller S.A. Goldie K. Cleveland D.W. Aebi U. J. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Most evidence for current ideas on IF assembly is based on EM results and cross-linking studies. The latter give very detailed information on the connections between amino acids of different protein subunits, but the hierarchy of dimer-dimer interactions in IFs cannot be deduced from them, the size distribution of the oligomers is unknown, and direct evidence for higher structures is not obtained. To verify postulated models in solution and to obtain more information on three-dimensional growth and organization of IFs, we have performed a TEB study on MgCl2-induced filament formation of the type III IF proteins vimentin and GFAP. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study on the architecture of complete glial filaments, the paper by Stewart et al. (26Stewart M. Quinlan R.A. Moyer R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) on the rod portion of GFAP being the only other detailed structural study on this protein. Vimentin from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and GFAP from bovine brain white matter, purified as described (27Vorgias C.E. Traub P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C, was dissolved in 2 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 6 m urea. From this buffer, the proteins were dialyzed at 4 °C for at least 16 h against 0.7 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 6 mm2-mercaptoethanol (vimentin), and 2 mm BisTris·HCl, pH 6.8, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (GFAP). The vimentin and GFAP concentrations in the absence of MgCl2 were determined from the absorption using a molar extinction coefficient (ε) (per polypeptide chain) at 280 nm of 24,240 m−1cm−1 for vimentin and 20,100 m−1cm−1 for GFAP, calculated from the extinction coefficients of the individual tryptophan (ε = 6300 m−1cm−1) and tyrosine (ε = 1380m−1 cm−1) residues (28). Protein concentrations were adjusted to 0.08–0.14 mg/ml. When dissolved optically anisotropic molecules are oriented by a square electric-field pulse, the solution becomes birefringent. When the field is switched off, the order and hence the birefringence decays by rotational diffusion with a rate that depends on the size and the shape of the molecules. From the accurately measurable time-resolved birefringence, the following parameters can be determined. 1) The ratio of the areas enclosed by the rise and decay curve of the birefringence, S 1/S 2 (see Fig. 1), which is related to the relative magnitudes of the permanent (P) and induced (Q) dipole moments of the particles according to Ref. 29Fredericq E. Houssier C. Electric Dichroism and Electric Birefringence.in: Harrington W. Peacocke A.R. Clarendon Press, Oxford1973Google Scholar.S1S2=4PQ+1/PQ+1Equation 1 2) The Kerr constant (K), which is defined as the proportionality constant between the magnitude of the steady-state birefringence, Δn 0, and the square of the electric field E (K = Δn 0/E 2) at low fields;K is proportional to the product of P +Q and the optical anisotropy factor of the molecule. 3) The field-free decay time τ of the birefringence signal, yielding information on size and flexibility of the molecules (29Fredericq E. Houssier C. Electric Dichroism and Electric Birefringence.in: Harrington W. Peacocke A.R. Clarendon Press, Oxford1973Google Scholar). In a multispecies system, the average decay time τav is given by the equation,τav=∑iciKiτi∑iciKiEquation 2 where c i and K i are the concentration and Kerr constant of species i with decay time τ i. Here we treat the filament aggregates as rigid cylindrical rods. For such particles, τ equals 1/(6D r), whereD r is the end-over-end rotational diffusion coefficient (s−1). Several expressions forD r have been developed (30Broersma S. J. Chem. Phys. 1960; 32: 1626-1631Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 31Broersma S. J. Chem. Phys. 1981; 74: 6989-6990Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 32Mandelkern M. Elias J.G. Eden D. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).D r is strongly dependent on the length and rather insensitive to changes in the diameter. The electric birefringence setup has been described in detail (33Van Haeringen B. Jiskoot W. van Grondelle R. Bloemendal M. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1992; 9: 991-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The field strength was varied between 0.3 and 4.0 kV/cm, the pulse width between 70 and 500 μs, and the sample interval between 0.1 and 1.0 μs. At least one early experiment was repeated at the end of a series to ensure that the samples remained intact. For each birefringence curve, at least 100 transients were averaged. Field strengths were determined by averaging five electric field pulses. Measurements were performed at 20 °C. To study the assembly of GFAP and vimentin IF under the influence of MgCl2 (or NaCl), small aliquots of a 20 mmstock solution were added to the protein solution (volume 0.8 ml) and mixed using a Pasteur pipette. Transients were measured after 10 min and repeated until the TEB signal was constant. Conductivity of the samples was determined by measuring the impedance of the solution in the Kerr cell at 1 kHz (Fluke Impedance Bridge model 710B). The resistance of the solution ranged from 400 ± 100 Ω in the absence of MgCl2 to approximately 80 Ω at 2.5 mm MgCl2. The Kerr constants were determined in solutions with a resistance of 200 Ω by dialysis of the proteins from the aqueous low salt buffers (0.7 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 2 mmBisTris·HCl, pH 6.8) to buffers with different concentrations of MgCl2 (see Table I). The resistance was then adjusted to 200 Ω with NaCl, which did not change the birefringence decay signals. For vimentin at 1 mm MgCl2, where the resistance of the solution was 140 Ω only, a correction of the Kerr constant to 200-Ω solutions was made. Since the Kerr constants of vimentin at pH 8.5 and T-vimentin at pH 7.5 (in the presence and absence of MgCl2) were approximately 30% smaller at 140 than at 200 Ω, the corrected K value for vimentin at 1 mm MgCl2 as presented in Table I is 50% larger than the measured one.Table IKerr constants for 1 m protein chain and S1/S2 values of vimentin and GFAP at different MgCl2 concentrationprotein[MgCl2]Pulse lengthS 1/S 2Kmmμs× 10 −13 m 2 V −2Vimentin0702.1 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.2Vimentin0.3701.1 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.2Vimentin0.52001.1 ± 0.14.0 ± 1.0Vimentin1.05001.1 ± 0.113.2 ± 1.31-aCorrected value (see “Experimental Procedures”).GFAP01401.5 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.3GFAP0.21401.2 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.3GFAP0.35001.1 ± 0.112.4 ± 0.8GFAP0.55001.1 ± 0.117.0 ± 1.1The resistance of the solution was adjusted to 200 Ω (see “Experimental Procedures”).1-a Corrected value (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab The resistance of the solution was adjusted to 200 Ω (see “Experimental Procedures”). Steady-state birefringence was determined by averaging the plateau of the rise curve. The field-free decay of the birefringence was analyzed on a SUN4 workstation using the computer programs DISCRETE (34Provencher S.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 27-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 35Provencher S.W. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 2772-2777Crossref Scopus (621) Google Scholar) and CONTIN (36Provencher S.W. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 213-227Crossref Scopus (2623) Google Scholar, 37Provencher S.W. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). The former fits data with discrete exponential decays, while the latter uses a continuous distribution of exponential decay times. In this paper we predominantly present results obtained from the analysis with DISCRETE, but in all cases the data were also analyzed with CONTIN to ensure that consistent results were obtained. Analyses were started 0.20 μs (when the sample interval (SI) = 0.1 or 0.2 μs), 0.50 μs (SI = 0.5 μs), or 1.0 μs (SI = 1.0 μs) after the orienting field was turned off. The TEB signal of vimentin at pH 7.5 in the absence of MgCl2 is shown in Fig. 1. TheS 1/S 2 value (2.1 ± 0.1) is somewhat lower than that reported previously for vimentin at pH 6.8 and 8.5 (6Kooijman M. Bloemendal M. van Amerongen H. Traub P. van Grondelle R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), presumably due to the use of a slightly different buffer. When 0.3 mm MgCl2 is added,S 1/S 2 decreases from 2.1 ± 0.1 to 1.1 ± 0.1 (TableI), showing that the permanent dipole moment has almost disappeared. Such a decrease is not observed when MgCl2 is replaced by NaCl under conditions of equal sample resistance, reflecting a specific role of Mg2+. The Kerr constant of vimentin in the absence of MgCl2 is 1.2 ± 0.2 × 10−13 m2V−2 for 1m protein chain, a value comparable with that at pH 6.8 and 8.5 (6Kooijman M. Bloemendal M. van Amerongen H. Traub P. van Grondelle R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The addition of 0.3 mm MgCl2 does not change the Kerr constant to a large extent (Table I). For GFAP at pH 6.8, the effect of small amounts of MgCl2 (0.2 mm) on S 1/S 2is comparable with that for vimentin (a decrease from 1.5 ± 0.2 to 1.2 ± 0.1; see Table I), while NaCl did not result in such a decrease. The Kerr constant of GFAP is not affected between 0 and 0.2 mm MgCl2 (Table I). Raising the MgCl2 concentration from 0.3 to 1.0 mm for vimentin and from 0.2 to 0.5 mm for GFAP leads to an increase of K by a factor of 15 and 12, respectively (Table I). On the other hand, theS 1/S 2 values of both proteins are not affected. At higher MgCl2 concentrations, no steady-state birefringence could be reached; thus, no Kerr constants and S 1/S 2 values could be estimated. CONTIN and DISCRETE analyses of the birefringence decay signals of vimentin (after 70-μs pulses) and GFAP (after 140-μs pulses) are presented in Tables II andIII. For clarity, the decay processes in the tables have been denoted τ1 … τ6(Table II) or τ1 … τ7 (Table III) with corresponding relative contributionsA 1 … A 6 orA 1 … A 7. This classification is just for convenience and does not automatically mean that, for instance, all τ3 values in the table are identical (compare τ3 of GFAP at 0.2 mm and 2.5 mm MgCl2). At MgCl2concentrations higher than 2.5 mm, CONTIN (showing a broad distribution of decay times) and DISCRETE are not able to resolve the decay processes adequately (data not shown). However, up to 2.5 mm MgCl2 well defined and mutually consistent decay times are produced by CONTIN and DISCRETE, CONTIN giving fully resolved distributions around the average decay times of DISCRETE. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 for GFAP at 2.5 MgCl2, where a good description requires decay times of approximately 40, 100, and 430 μs. Apparently, up to 2.5 mm MgCl2, a limited number of species are present in the solution.Table IITEB decay analysis after electric field pulses of vimentin at various concentrations of MgCl2 by CONTIN and DISCRETE[MgCl2]A 1τ1A 2τ2A 3τ3A 4τ4A 5τ5A 6τ6mm%μs%μs%μs%μs%μs%μs02-aSample interval was 0.1 μs.48 ± 51.2 ± 0.848 ± 55.3 ± 1.3<424 ± 80.32-aSample interval was 0.1 μs.52 ± 61.2 ± 0.844 ± 65.5 ± 1.5<630 ± 100.52-bSample interval was 0.5 μs.13 ± 41.4 ± 0.560 ± 85.5 ± 1.527 ± 1226 ± 51.02-bSample interval was 0.5 μs.<104.0 ± 2.075 ± 829 ± 825 ± 670 ± 171.42-bSample interval was 0.5 μs.35 ± 733 ± 755 ± 560 ± 10<10170 ± 501.82-bSample interval was 0.5 μs.60 ± 102-cDecay times not assigned to distinct oligomeric species but to a bent/flexible structure (see “Results”).44 ± 52-cDecay times not assigned to distinct oligomeric species but to a bent/flexible structure (see “Results”).35 ± 7120 ± 15<5250 ± 502.52-bSample interval was 0.5 μs.45 ± 82-cDecay times not assigned to distinct oligomeric species but to a bent/flexible structure (see “Results”).42 ± 62-cDecay times not assigned to distinct oligomeric species but to a bent/flexible structure (see “Results”).50 ± 8110 ± 15<5250 ± 50Decay times (τ) and their relative contributions (A) assigned to distinct oligomeric species with a relative contribution >10% are denoted in boldface type; decay times with a relative contribution <10% are denoted in italics.

Pulse length was 140 μs. For vimentin at 0 mm MgCl2, two major decay processes (1.2 ± 0.8 μs (τ1) and 5.3 ± 1.3 μs (τ2)), and a small contribution (<4%) of a longer component (24 ± 8 μs) (Table II) are found. In our previous studies on vimentin at pH 6.8 and 8.5 in the absence of MgCl2 (6Kooijman M. Bloemendal M. van Amerongen H. Traub P. van Grondelle R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Kooijman M. Bloemendal M. Traub P. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2931-2937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we found that decay times of 0.3–2.0 μs can be assigned to dimers of approximately 45 nm in length with a flexible and/or bent structure and that decay times of 4.0–7.0 μs can be assigned to staggered particles (probably tetramers and hexamers, possibly also octamers) with a length of 60–70 nm. Therefore, we conclude that, as at pH 6.8, vimentin at pH 7.5 without MgCl2 is mainly present as single dimers and staggered particles. At 0.3 mm MgCl2, the decay times are almost identical to those in the absence of MgCl2, suggesting that the average length of the particles does not change. Also for GFAP at 0 or 0.2 mm MgCl2, a decay time of 5.5 ± 1.5 μs is found (Table III). As for vimentin, we assign this to staggered particles (probably tetramers and hexamers, possibly also octamers) with a length of 60–70 nm. However, additionally, a small component with a decay time of 17 ± 4 μs is detected (Table III), showing that larger aggregates are already formed in the absence of MgCl2. The shortest decay time of GFAP (τ1 in Table III) has been described and analyzed before (7Kooijman M. van Amerongen H. Traub P. van Grondelle R. Bloemendal M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and is probably not due to dimers but arises from a bent and/or flexible higher oligomer. This can explain the lower value forS 1/S 2 in comparison with vimentin, since fewer dimers means a lower permanent dipole moment contribution to the orientation mechanism of the particles. At higher MgCl2 concentrations, the average TEB decay time (τav) becomes much larger (see Fig.2), whereas addition of NaCl (not shown) had no effect on τav. For vimentin, formation of larger aggregates starts at 0.5 mmMgCl2. A “new” component with a decay time of 26 ± 5 μs (τ3) and a relative contribution of approximately 27% (see Table II) appears, but a significant fraction of dimers and staggered structures (τ1 and τ2) is still present. τ1 and τ2 disappear at higher concentrations of MgCl2, and a gradual shift to longer decay times due to larger particles (τ3, τ4, and τ5) is observed. At 1.8 and 2.5 mm MgCl2, two major decay times, around 40 and 110 μs, are found. The 40-μs component is intermediate between τ3 and τ4 as obtained at lower MgCl2 concentrations and might be an unresolved average of the two. Alternatively, it is due to a flexibility mode of higher oligomers. For GFAP, a similar pattern with almost identical decay times as for vimentin is observed (Table III, Fig. 2), but assembly occurs at lower MgCl2 concentrations. Larger structures are formed at 0.3 mm MgCl2, where τ1 and τ2 are no longer observed. Above 1.0 mmMgCl2, the shortest decay time (τ3) reflects either the average of τ3 and τ4 measured at lower MgCl2 concentrations or flexibility of higher order aggregates. At 2.0 and 2.5 mm MgCl2, a very long decay time of approximately 430 μs is observed (τ7in Table III), which is not detected in the case of vimentin. In Table IV, the weighted average values of the various relaxation times with their assignments are given. We do not use decay times with a relative contribution less than 10% in the calculation, since their precise value is difficult to estimate.Table IVAverage-relaxation times (τav) (μs) and their assignment in vimentin and GFAPτavvimentinτav GFAPAssignment4-asee Results and Discussion for assignments.μsμsτ1A1.3 ± 0.4Dimer rotation and flexibilityτ1B1.0 ± 0.3Flexibility of higher oligomerτ25.4 ± 1.05.7 ± 0.8Rotation staggered ∼65-nm building blockτ3A17 ± 4Particle with le"

The mutations was genetically stable. Despite this massive loss of mitochondrial genes, the mutant did not seem to be affected. Distribution of the two genome types, cell levels of mitochondrial DNA, steady-state concentrations of the mitochondrial gene transcripts, mitochondrial enzymatic activities, and ATP synthesis capacities were measured in the head, thorax, and abdomen fractions of the mutant strain in comparison with a wild type strain. Results indicate that the deleted genomes are detected in all fractions but to a lesser extent in the male and female abdomen. In all fractions, there is a 50% increase in cellular mitochondrial DNA content. Although there is a decrease in steady-state concentrations of mitochondrial transcripts of genes affected by deletion, this is smaller than expected. The variations in mitochondrial biochemical activities in the different fractions of the wild strain are upheld in the mutant strain. Activity of complex I (involved in mutation) nevertheless shows a decrease in all fractions; activity of complex III (likewise involved) shows little or no change; finally, mitochondrial ATP synthesis capacity is identical to that observed in the wild strain. This latter finding possibly accounts for the lack of phenotype. This mutant is a good model for studying mitochondrial genome alterations and the role of the nuclear genome in these phenomena.

Various alterations in the mitochondrial genome have been correlated with severe human pathology (1DiMauro S. Moraes C.T. Arch. Neurol. 1993; 50: 1197-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 2Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8739-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 3Wallace D.C.

Among the most substantial of these alterations, deletions, which account for a small fraction of the described cases, have always been detected at the heteroplasmic state (4Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Morgan-Hugues J.A. Nature. 1988; 331: 717-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 5Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Petty R.K.H. Morgan-Hugues J.A. Am. J. Hum.

Once the proportion of deleted genomes reaches a critical threshold, these deletions have often very pejorative effects on mitochondrial function (7Hayashi J.-H. Ohta S. Kikuch A.M.T. Goto Y.-I.

Acta. 1995; 1271: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Such mutations are generally sporadic, although dominant autosomal factors have been observed (9Zeviani M. Servidei S. Gellera C. Bertini E. DiMauro S. DiDonato S. Nature. 1989; 339: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 10Suomalainen A. Kaukonen J. Amati P. Timonen R. Haltia M. Weissenbach J.

In the heteroplasmic state, the mutant Drosophila subobscurastrain studied in our laboratory presents a substantial mtDNA 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; W, wild strain; H, mutant strain; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; α-GP, α-glycerophosphate; CO, cytochrome oxydase; ND, NADH dehydrogenase. deletion (30% of the coding region) (12Volz-Lingenhöhl A. Solignac M. Sperlich D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11528-11532Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Contrary to clinical findings (1DiMauro S. Moraes C.T. Arch. Neurol. 1993; 50: 1197-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), this mutation remains stable from one generation to the next. It does not seem to affect the mutant (apparent absence of phenotype) in terms of reproduction (number of embryos, emergence of larvae), life span, or flight capacities. This strain thus offers a good model for studying possible biochemical and molecular consequences of severe mitochondrial genome alteration and the responses that enable the mutant to survive. The first investigations, performed in the whole adult fly (13Béziat F. Morel F. Volz-Lingenhöhl A. Saint-Paul N. Alziari S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), showed a strong heteroplasmic tendency in the deleted molecules; this affected 78% of the mitochondrial genomes. mtDNA cell content (per nuclear genome) showed a 50% increase in the mutant strain compared with theD. subobscura wild strain. Determinations of steady-state concentrations of mitochondrial transcripts showed these to be identical to values measured for transcripts of genes unaffected by deletion (12 S, COIII). On the other hand, the transcript concentrations of the concerned genes showed a decrease, although this was less than expected and differed according to the genes (from 55% for ND1 to 35% for cytochrome b). Furthermore, detection of the fusion transcript (13Béziat F. Morel F. Volz-Lingenhöhl A. Saint-Paul N. Alziari S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that both types of genomes were expressed. Maximum respiratory complex activities were identical in the wild type and mutant strains for complex IV. They were, respectively, 30% and 40% lower for complexes III and I (14Debise R. Touraille S. Durand R. Alziari S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these differences were not seen for complex III in our experimental conditions for respiratory chain observation (oxygraphy), whereas complex I consistently presented a 30% decrease in activity. The respiratory chain would thus seem to be operative as of complex III. No ultra structural mitochondrial alteration was observed irrespective of the studied tissues. Moreover, cytochrome oxidase activity was detectable in all mitochondria. Heteroplasmy was probably intramitochondrial (15Lecher P. Béziat F. Alziari S. Biol. Cell. 1994; 80: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Lecher P. Petit N. Béziat F. Alziari S. Eur. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 71: 423-427PubMed Google Scholar), since both types of genomes coexisted in each mitochondria. Overall, these results tend to indicate compensation for the consequences of deletion at the level of the whole fly. One possible explanation for this surprising apparent innocuousness of the mutation is that compensation may exist between the various tissues or certain (vital) tissues may be less affected than others. The results presented in this article were obtained from measurements performed in mitochondrially enriched fractions of various tissues with high energy requirements. Whereas studies described in man show that distribution of deleted molecules and effects of deletion may differ substantially from one tissue to another (17Ponzetto C. Bresolin M. Bordini A. Moggio M. Meola G. Bet L. Prelle A. Scarlato G. J. Neurol. Sci. 1990; 96: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), this is not so for the mutant D. subobscura strain we studied, in which biochemical specificities of the various tissues are upheld. The studied flies belong to the D. subobscura strain and were raised on medium standard cornmeal as described (12Volz-Lingenhöhl A. Solignac M. Sperlich D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11528-11532Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) at 19 °C. The wild strain (W) acts as a control to study the effects of deletion on the mutant strain (H). The various studied fractions were enriched with a given mitochondrial type: the mitochondria of the nerve tissue for the head, those of the muscle tissue for the thorax, and those of male or female genital organs for the male or female abdomens. The flies were frozen for molecular biology or anaesthetized in ice for biochemistry before dissection of the three parts (head, thorax, abdomen). The obtained fractions were used as quickly as possible for extraction of nucleic acids or mitochondria. Total DNA was obtained from 50–60 heads, thoraces, or abdomens according to the method described by F. Béziat et al.(13Béziat F. Morel F. Volz-Lingenhöhl A. Saint-Paul N. Alziari S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 50–60 heads, thoraces, or abdomens were ground in 1 ml of RNA-ZOLTM (Bioprobe system) at 4 °C. 0.1 volume of chloroform, isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v) was added. After stirring and incubation (5 min at 4 °C), the aqueous and organic layers were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C. The RNA was precipitated with a volume of isopropyl alcohol. Heteroplasmy was determined by Southern blotting of DNA fragments obtained after digesting DNA with MspI and hybridization with the COIII probe labeled as described (13Béziat F. Morel F. Volz-Lingenhöhl A. Saint-Paul N. Alziari S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The signals were analyzed by densitometry. Mitochondrial DNA content was measured by comparison with nuclear DNA by slot blot of the various DNA fractions followed by hybridization with a mitochondrial probe (12 S RNA) and a nuclear probe (18 S). The signals were analyzed by densitometry, as was heteroplasmy. RNA content was estimated by the Northern technique using 18 S RNA as the control RNA. The studied RNAs are 12 S RNA and COIII (genes not involved in deletion), cytochrome b, and ND1, ND5, ND4-4L (genes involved in deletion), using the probes described in Ref.13Béziat F. Morel F. Volz-Lingenhöhl A. Saint-Paul N. Alziari S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. The mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugations of ground tissue samples in buffer containing 0.22 msucrose, 0.12 m mannitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tricine, pH 7.6 (18Alziari S. Stepien G. Durand R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Protein determination was performed with Bio-Rad reagent using the method of Bradford method (19Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). For enzymatic assays, mitochondria (about 1 mg protein/ml) were sonicated for 6 s at 4 °C then frozen and unfrozen except for α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and ATP synthesis determinations. All activities were measured at 28 °C and expressed in nmol·min−1· mg−1. NADH oxidation was monitored at 340 nm in a pH 7.2 buffer containing 35 mmNaH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence of 2 μg/ml antimycin, 2 mm KCN, 97.5 μm ubiquinone, 0.13 mm NADH, and 50 μg of mitochondrial proteins. Only the rotenone-sensitive activity is noted. Ubiquinol was obtained by reduction of ubiquinone with sodium dithionite followed by extraction with cyclohexane. After evaporation of the cyclohexane, ubiquinol was dissolved in ethyl alcohol and stabilized with 10 mm HCl. To measure the activity of complex III, cytochrome c reduction was monitored at 550 nm (ε = 18,500m−1·cm−1) in 1 ml pH 7.2 buffer containing 35 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence of 2 mm KCN, 2 μg/ml rotenone, 15 μm ubiquinol, 15 μm cytochromec, and 5 μg of mitochondrial proteins. The nonenzymatic reduction of cytochrome c with ubiquinol (in the absence of mitochondria) was deduced from this measurement. Oxidation of partially reduced cytochrome c (reduced OD − oxidized OD ∼ 0.65) was monitored at 550 nm (ε = 18,500m−1·cm−1) in 1 ml of pH 7.4 buffer containing 30 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 56 μm cytochrome c, 5 μg of mitochondrial proteins. The appearance of thionitrobenzoic acid (yellow) derived from the reduction of dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) (colorless) with coenzyme A, was monitored at 412 nm (ε = 13,600 m−1·cm−1) in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 8 buffer, 2.5 mm EDTA, 37 μm acetyl-CoA, 75 μm dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), 300 μm oxaloacetate, 5 μg of mitochondrial proteins. 20 μg of mitochondrial proteins were incubated for 30 min in 100 μl of 40 mm Pi buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mmKCN, 0.2% p-iodonitrotetrozolium violet, 10 mmα-glycerophosphate (α-GP). The reaction was stopped with 400 μl of 1 m acetic acid, and the iodoformazan thus formed was extracted with 1 ml of pure ethyl acetate. The organic layer was recovered by centrifugation and the OD was read at 500 nm (ε = 18,500m−1·cm−1). This value allows deduction of the OD of a test not containing α-GP. The reduction of NAD by α-GP was monitored at 340 nm in 100 mm glycine buffer, pH 9.8, containing 0.5 mmNAD, 10 mm hydrazine (to displace the reaction toward NADH formation), 5 mm α-GP, and 50 μg of post-mitochondrial supernatant proteins. Mitochondrial ATP synthesis was measured using a technique derived from that described by Wibomet al. (26Wibom R. Söderlund K. Lundin A. Hultman E. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1991; 6: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) based on the luminescence of luciferin in the presence of luciferase, which is proportional to the ATP concentration in the test medium (27Deluca M. Adv. Enzymol. 1969; 44: 37-68Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, the photon flux emitted by the reagent (BioOrbit) remains constant for several minutes for a determined ATP concentration. Synthesis kinetics can thus be directly monitored with a BioOrbit 1251 luminometer. Kinetics were recorded at 25 °C, pH 7.5, with 50 μl of the incubation medium containing 0.15 mm ATP and 1 μg of mitochondrial proteins. After 2 min of incubation, 5 μl of substrate and 100 μl of reagent were added simultaneously, and fluorescence was monitored for 1 min. The final concentrations of substrates were 5 mmglutamate + 2 mm malate, 15 mm proline + 2 mm malate, 1 mm palmityl carnitine + 2 mm malate, or 10 mm α-glycerophosphate. Calibration was performed at the end of each measurement by the addition of 200 pmol of ATP. A control run in the presence of oligomycin allows ATP synthesis imputable to intermembranar adenylate kinase activity to be subtracted from the result. Results are compared for the various tissues of a single strain, then for tissues of the two strains (W and H). The values thus determined are considered significantly different where the statistical study (Student's t test) yields a value ofp < 0.05. Three fractions are readily accessible in the Drosophila. One tissue is particularly well represented in each of these three fractions. Hence, mitochondria from this tissue constitute the dominant population: the head, where the mitochondrial pellet is enriched with nerve tissue mitochondria; the thorax, with muscle mitochondria, particularly from flight muscles; and the abdomen, with mitochondria from the germ line, particularly in the abdomens of pubescent females. These samples thus allow evaluation of the characteristics of mitochondria from different tissues, all of which have high energy demands but different biochemical characteristics. The possible influence of mutation is studied on these fractions; thus, on mitochondria from different tissues. Relative proportions of the two types of mitochondrial genomes are determined after incubation of total DNA with the MspI enzyme followed by hybridization with the COIII probe as described above (13Béziat F. Morel F. Volz-Lingenhöhl A. Saint-Paul N. Alziari S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Heteroplasmy measured in the fractions from heads and thoraces (containing somatic tissues), 74 ± 5% and 79 ± 6%, respectively, is not significantly different (p < 0.05) from that measured in the whole fly (78 ± 5%). On the other hand, there is a significantly lower percentage of heteroplasmy in the abdomens (containing the germ cells): 71 ± 5% in males, 63 ± 5% in females. Moreover, there is a significant difference in values for male and female abdomens. Cellular mtDNA content extracted from the various fractions of the wild and mutant strains is compared with nuclear DNA content as described previously (13Béziat F. Morel F. Volz-Lingenhöhl A.

These cellular contents are compared for different tissues from a given strain and for each tissue, comparing the two strains. To facilitate comparisons between the different fractions of the wild type strain, relative quantities of cellular mtDNA in the thorax and abdomen (Fig. 2) are evaluated by comparison with the content measured in the head (base 100 for the head). The cellular mtDNA content in the thorax is identical to that measured in the male abdomen and exceeds the content measured in the head by 50%. The mtDNA content is higher in the female abdomen than in the other fractions: × 3 compared with the head. Cellular mitochondrial DNA content is thus lower in the head fraction. The difference observed between the head and thorax corroborates electron microscopy findings, 2P. Lécher, unpublished results. where mitochondria are seen to be much more abundant in the thorax, or measurement of citrate synthetase activity, which is 2.5 times higher in the thorax than in the head. Very high levels are observed in female abdomens where maturing ova are prevalent. The same distribution of cellular mtDNA levels in the mutant strain for the various fractions is encountered (Fig. 2). mtDNA contents for each fraction are compared for the two strains. Compared with the wild strain, the mtDNA/cell content in the mutant strain shows a 43–75% increase (respectively, 75 ± 3, 72 ± 3, 43 ± 4, and 62 ± 4 for head, thorax, male and female abdomens). However, these differences do not significantly differ from results obtained for the whole fly (50% increase; Ref. 13Béziat F. Morel F. Volz-Lingenhöhl A. Saint-Paul N. Alziari S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For each fraction from the mutant strain, the relative percentage of intact and deleted molecules compared with the wild strain was calculated taking two parameters into account: increased cell content and heteroplasmy (the mtDNA content in each tissue of the wild strain is 100%, Fig. 3). The percentages of intact molecules are identical in the head and thorax fractions (36%) and comparable to those measured in the whole fly (30%). The percentage is significantly higher in the male abdomen (44.5%). The female abdomen contains 54% of intact molecules. Hence, the female abdomen apparently constitutes the fraction least affected by mutation. Total RNA extracted from the different fractions of the mutant and wild strains (see “Experimental Procedures”) is analyzed by Northern blot and hybridization with different probes. The results presented are obtained from six different extractions and Northern blot analyses. The fact that different probes with different specific activities were used makes it very difficult to exactly estimate steady-state concentrations for each transcript in the various fractions of the two strains. Steady-state concentrations are thus determined by comparing hybridization signals obtained with a single probe for transcripts extracted from head and thorax fractions and from male and female abdomens in the two strains. A control of RNA extraction and hybridization is obtained with the 18 S probe. The Rf ratios express hybridization signal ratios (corrected with 18 S) for each transcript in the various fractions of a given strain. The same membranes were used to compare the different transcript concentrations in each fraction between mutant and wild type. The Rs ratios express hybridization signal ratios (corrected with 18 S) for each transcript in the various fractions for the two strains. Head and thorax concentrations of the 12 S transcripts are identical (Rf = 1.1 ± 0.5). The COIII transcript shows a lower concentration (p < 0.05) in the head (Rf = 0.7 ± 0.2). Transcripts of complex I genes constitute identical quantities in both tissues (Rf ND1 = 0.9 ± 0.3, ND4-4L = 0.9 ± 0.2, ND5 = 1 ± 0.5). On the other hand, the concentration for cytochrome btranscript is much higher (p < 0.05) in the head (r = 3.3 ± 1.2). Male and female abdomen comparison gives results similar to those described for head and thorax except for cytochrome btranscript, which is in identical concentration in both abdomens (Rf = 0.7 ± 0.4, p > 0.05). Results indicate that the Rf obtained for transcripts 12 S, ND1, and cytochrome b (head/thorax or male/female abdomens) are identical to those obtained for the wild type. In the head and thorax, the COIII transcripts are in identical concentration (Rf = 1.4 ± 0.4; the difference is not significant). ND4-4L and ND5 transcripts (Rf = 1.3 ± 0.3 and Rf = 1.5 ± 0.1) show levels in male abdomens to be significantly higher than those observed in female abdomens (p < 0.05). The most remarkable finding is the fact that the head/thorax Rf for the cytochrome b transcript is very high (Rf = 2.6 ± 1.3), as in the wild strain. This tissular specificity was thus unaffected by the mutation involving this gene. Results indicate that the concentrations of gene transcripts (12 S, COIII) unaffected by deletion are lower in the head (20–30%); COIII transcript concentration also decrease in thorax. In contrast, they are higher (20–30%) in the abdomens of male or female. Concentrations of gene transcripts affected by mutation are lower in each fraction. Those of complex I decreased by 70% in the head and thorax. The decrease is less important in the abdomens (50% in male, 10–50% in female). The cytochrome b transcript concentration shows a 50% decrease in the different fractions. In each fraction, the mutation has affected the transcript concentrations of the genes involved by the deletion, but as observed in the whole fly, the observed decreases are very often not directly proportional to the quantities of intact genomes. The ND1–ND5 fusion transcript (1300 base pairs) was detected in RNA extractions from the whole fly, where its relative concentration was very similar to that of ND1 (13Béziat F. Morel F. Volz-Lingenhöhl A. Saint-Paul N. Alziari S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This transcript is detected in all fractions (results not show), indicating an expression of the deleted genomes in all tissue. The concentration in all fractions is not significantly different from that of the ND1 transcript. Mutation affects genes implicated in respiratory chain function. Biochemical activities of respiratory complexes I, III, and IV, certain subunits of which are coded by the mitochondrial genome, were tested in various fractions of the wild and mutant strains. The activity of citrate synthetase, an enzyme of the Krebs cycle of nuclear origin, was also measured. Enzymatic systems known to be active in insect mitochondria (28Sacktor B. Rockstein M. The Physiology of Insects. 4. Academic Press, New York1974: 271-354Google Scholar) and which possibly play a role in electron transfers toward respiratory chain complexes such as the α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and α-glycerophosphate oxidase couple, were likewise measured. Finally, ATP synthesis capacity by isolated mitochondria was evaluated. Activity of NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) by comparison with the head is lower in the abdomen and higher in the thorax. Activity of complex III is higher in the head than in the other fractions: three times the activity measured in the abdomen fractions (the difference between the male and female abdomen is not significant) and five times the measured activity in the thorax. In the head fraction, this activity is superior to that of complex I (× 8) and complex IV (× 2). Such activity in mitochondria of the head fraction correlated with the high concentration of Cytob transcript theoretically corresponds to higher demand on this complex and a different respiratory metabolism ensuring direct electron supply to ubiquinone and to complex III. Complex IV activity shows no significant differences for the studied fractions. This is the highest activity of the respiratory chain: 7–9 times the activity of complex I in the various fractions, except in the head where complex III is dominant. The activity of citrate synthetase is identical in the head, the male abdomen, and the female abdomen. On the other hand, it is very high (× 2.5) in the thorax, showing a much greater Krebs cycle potentiality in the muscles, which are highly solicited in flight (28Sacktor B. Rockstein M. The Physiology of Insects. 4. Academic Press, New York1974: 271-354Google Scholar). Two enzymes, the α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase cytosolic enzyme and α-glycerophosphate oxidase, located on the outer surface of the internal membrane, allow direct reduction of ubiquinone through cytosolic redox potential (α-GP shunt). Activities of these enzymes are clearly higher in the thorax: thoracic α-glycerophosphate oxidase is 3 times more active than α-glycerophosphate oxidase in the head or male abdomen (p < 0.001), and thoracic α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase is 4–5 times higher than α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase in these fractions. Activity of these enzymes is low in the female abdomen. Male and female activities are significantly different (p < 0.05). This metabolic shunt, which plays a major role in insects (28Sacktor B. Rockstein M. The Physiology of Insects. 4. Academic Press, New York1974: 271-354Google Scholar), should be more effective in the muscles, since α-GP is a substrate rapidly used for flight. Hence, mitochondrial metabolism in the fly shows tissular specificity: enzymatic capacities vary and logically reflect different metabolic flux for the different tissues. Comparison of activities in the various studied fractions leads to the same conclusions as above. Mutation did not modify tissular specificities of the studied metabolisms; hence, normal metabolic flux was theoretically upheld. We compared activity for each fraction of the mutant strain with that of the corresponding wild strain: Ra (activity H/activity W) is shown in Fig. 7. Activity of complex I clearly decreases in all fractions: Ra = 0.5 in the head, 0.6 in the thorax, and 0.7 in the abdomen. In the whole fly (Ra = 0.6), this activity decreases as observed in the thorax. The smallest decrease in activity, in the abdomen, is probably attributable to the fact that heteroplasmy is only 62% in females and 71% in males (but the differences between the male and female abdomen is not significant). Activity of the complex III is not affected in the head and male abdomen but drops in the thorax (Ra = 0.8) and in the female abdomen (Ra = 0.7). This decrease is identical to that observed in the whole fly (Ra = 0.8). Hence, mutation does not affect the very important activity of this complex in the head. There is no significant difference in complex IV activity for the two strains irrespective of the studied fraction. Results thus bear out those observed for the whole fly (14Debise R. Touraille S. Durand R. Alziari S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar): mutations affecting complex I and complex III activities do not affect complex IV activity. This indicates that in the mutant strain, the protein synthesis in all mitochondria is normal, as observed previously (15Lecher P. Béziat F. Alziari S. Biol. Cell. 1994; 80: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Activity of citrate synthetase is identical in the two strains for the head and thorax but is higher in the mutant abdomens (p< 0.05). This possibly indicates increased Krebs cycle activity.
