https://openalex.org/W2616215756,"Polymorphisms in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I genes can cause the rejection of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived products in allogeneic recipients. Disruption of the Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M) gene eliminates surface expression of all class I molecules, but leaves the cells vulnerable to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells. Here we show that this 'missing-self' response can be prevented by forced expression of minimally polymorphic HLA-E molecules. We use adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene editing to knock in HLA-E genes at the B2M locus in human PSCs in a manner that confers inducible, regulated, surface expression of HLA-E single-chain dimers (fused to B2M) or trimers (fused to B2M and a peptide antigen), without surface expression of HLA-A, B or C. These HLA-engineered PSCs and their differentiated derivatives are not recognized as allogeneic by CD8+ T cells, do not bind anti-HLA antibodies and are resistant to NK-mediated lysis. Our approach provides a potential source of universal donor cells for applications where the differentiated derivatives lack HLA class II expression."
https://openalex.org/W2616744713,"Elise Robinson and colleagues present the polygenic transmission disequilibrium test (pTDT) for evaluating transmission of polygenic risk in family-based study designs. The authors apply pTDT to a cohort of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) families and find that common polygenic variation acts additively with de novo variants to contribute to ASD risk. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk is influenced by common polygenic and de novo variation. We aimed to clarify the influence of polygenic risk for ASD and to identify subgroups of ASD cases, including those with strongly acting de novo variants, in which polygenic risk is relevant. Using a novel approach called the polygenic transmission disequilibrium test and data from 6,454 families with a child with ASD, we show that polygenic risk for ASD, schizophrenia, and greater educational attainment is over-transmitted to children with ASD. These findings hold independent of proband IQ. We find that polygenic variation contributes additively to risk in ASD cases who carry a strongly acting de novo variant. Lastly, we show that elements of polygenic risk are independent and differ in their relationship with phenotype. These results confirm that the genetic influences on ASD are additive and suggest that they create risk through at least partially distinct etiologic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2614253029,"Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics are ideally placed to unravel intratumoral heterogeneity and selective resistance of cancer stem cell (SC) subpopulations to molecularly targeted cancer therapies. However, current single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches lack the sensitivity required to reliably detect somatic mutations. We developed a method that combines high-sensitivity mutation detection with whole-transcriptome analysis of the same single cell. We applied this technique to analyze more than 2,000 SCs from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) throughout the disease course, revealing heterogeneity of CML-SCs, including the identification of a subgroup of CML-SCs with a distinct molecular signature that selectively persisted during prolonged therapy. Analysis of nonleukemic SCs from patients with CML also provided new insights into cell-extrinsic disruption of hematopoiesis in CML associated with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we used this single-cell approach to identify a blast-crisis-specific SC population, which was also present in a subclone of CML-SCs during the chronic phase in a patient who subsequently developed blast crisis. This approach, which might be broadly applied to any malignancy, illustrates how single-cell analysis can identify subpopulations of therapy-resistant SCs that are not apparent through cell-population analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2613240323,"Herpes zoster (shingles) causes significant morbidity in immune compromised hosts and older adults. Whereas a vaccine is available for prevention of shingles, its efficacy declines with age. To help to understand the mechanisms driving vaccinal responses, we constructed a multiscale, multifactorial response network (MMRN) of immunity in healthy young and older adults immunized with the live attenuated shingles vaccine Zostavax. Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, plasmablasts, and CD4+ T cells yet limited CD8+ T cell and antiviral responses. The MMRN reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms controlling immunity to vaccination."

Here we report the cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human spliceosome just before exon ligation (the C∗ complex) at an average resolution of 3.76 Å. The splicing factor Prp17 stabilizes the active site conformation. The step II factor Slu7 adopts an extended conformation, binds Prp8 and Cwc22, and is poised for selection of the 3′-splice site. Remarkably, the intron lariat traverses through a positively charged central channel of RBM22; this unusual organization suggests mechanisms of intron recruitment, confinement, and release. The protein PRKRIP1 forms a 100-Å α helix linking the distant U2 snRNP to the catalytic center.

Each splicing cycle consists of two sequential steps of transesterification (Fica et al., 2013Fica S.M. Tuttle N. Novak T. Li N.S. Lu J. Koodathingal P. Dai Q. Staley J.P. Piccirilli J.A.

The first step, commonly known as branching, results in the release of the 5′-exon and formation of an intron lariat intermediate. The second step leads to ligation of the 5′- and 3′-exons. The highly dynamic spliceosome contains a stable core of about 20 components. Spliceosomal remodeling by the conserved DExD/H-box ATPases/helicases during each splicing cycle generates at least seven distinct states: the pre-catalytic B complex, the activated Bact complex, the step I catalytically activated B∗ complex, the C complex, the step II catalytically activated C∗ complex, the post-catalytic P complex, and the ILS complex (Ohrt et al., 2013Ohrt T.

In contrast, the second-step transesterification (exon ligation) remains to be mechanistically characterized despite structural advances on the C∗ complex (Bertram et al., 2017Bertram K.

Limited by its inherent compositional heterogeneity and conformational flexibility, the human spliceosome is yet to be captured at an atomic resolution. In this manuscript, we report the cryo-EM structure of the human C∗ complex at an average resolution of 3.76 Å, with the local resolution at the center of the spliceosome reaching 3.0–3.5 Å. Using a combination of de novo modeling, homology building, and structure docking, we have generated a complete atomic model for the human C∗ complex. The structure reveals a number of striking features that advance mechanistic understanding of the exon ligation. To trap the C∗ complex, we incubated the HeLa cell nuclear extract with a synthetic MS2-tagged MINX pre-mRNA where the nucleotides AG at the 3′ end of the 3′-splice site (3′SS) were mutated to GG. The assembled spliceosome was affinity purified, centrifuged in the presence of the crosslinking agent glutaraldehyde, and imaged on a Titan Krios microscope (Figure S1). A total of 661,614 particles were chosen from 7,308 micrographs and sorted by three-dimensional (3D) classifications (Figure S2). Reconstruction of 100,085 particles yielded an EM density map of the human spliceosome at an average resolution of 3.76 Å on the basis of the FSC value 0.143 (Figures S2 and S3; Tables S1 and S2). The EM map quality in the peripheral regions of the spliceosome was further improved by the application of soft masks and additional 3D classification (Figure S4).Figure S2Cryo-EM Structure Determination of the Human Spliceosomal C∗ Complex, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Analysis of the initial dataset of 500 micrographs of the affinity-purified human spliceosomal complexes.(B) A flow chart for the cryo-EM data processing and structure determination of the human spliceosomal C∗ complex.

Although the quality of the EM map is progressively lower away from the core (Table S2), it still allows atomic modeling in the surrounding regions and docking of known X-ray structures in the periphery. The final atomic model of the human C∗ complex contains 14,496 residues from 46 proteins and 380 RNA nucleotides, which amount to approximately 1.7 mega-Daltons (Figure 1A; Tables S1 and S2). Of the modeled residues, 12,030 have side chains, and the rest were built as poly-Ala. 321 nucleotides are assigned to U2, U5, and U6 snRNAs. 59 nucleotides are attributed to the intron lariat intermediate and the 5′-exon.Figure S6Representative EM Density Maps of the RNA Elements in the Human C∗ Complex, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) The overall EM density map surrounding the active site.

The overall organization and the active site conformation of the human C∗ complex are very similar to those reported in the 5.9-Å structure (Bertram et al., 2017Bertram K. Agafonov D.E. Liu W.T.

Cryo-EM structure of a human spliceosome activated for step 2 of splicing.Nature. 2017; 542: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The much-improved resolution allows us to identify six additional spliceosomal proteins that play crucial roles in exon ligation. These proteins include the ATPase/helicase Brr2, the step II factor Slu7, the double-stranded RNA-binding protein PRKRIP1 (Yin et al., 2003Yin Z. Haynie J. Williams B.R. Yang Y.C. C114 is a novel IL-11-inducible nuclear double-stranded RNA-binding protein that inhibits protein kinase R.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22838-22845Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and three components of the EJC (MAGOH, Y14, and MLN51). Importantly, we were able to continuously trace the polypeptide chains of the step II splicing factor Prp17 and the NineTeen Complex-related (NTR) protein RBM22, each playing a key role in pre-mRNA splicing. Furthermore, there are numerous fine structural features that may bear functional implications. On the basis of the EM density maps (Figure S6) and information on the yeast C∗ complex (Fica et al., 2017Fica S.M. Oubridge C. Galej W.P. Wilkinson M.E. Bai X.C. Newman A.J. Nagai K.

In the human C∗ complex, M1 is coordinated by the phosphates of G72 and U74 from U6 snRNA and the 3′-OH at the 3′ end of the 5′-exon (Figure 2B, left panel). M2 activates the nucleophile in the branching reaction and stabilizes the leaving group during exon ligation. M2 is bound by the phosphates of three nucleotides from U6 snRNA: A53, G54, and U74 (Figure 2B, right panel). In addition to the three structural metals, an additional metal ion stabilizes a tight turn of the RNA sequences at the edge of the internal stem loop (ISL); this metal is absent in the yeast C∗ complex (Fica et al., 2017Fica S.M.

The EM density in this region allow unambiguous identification of the duplex but is insufficient for atomic modeling of the base-pairing interactions (Figure S7A). Although the ISL is perfectly aligned between the human and yeast C∗ complexes, the U6 snRNA sequences upstream of the ACAGA box exhibit quite distinct local conformations due to formation of the extended duplex in the human C∗ complex (Figure 2E). The intron sequences downstream of the 5′SS in the human C∗ complex are separated away from those in the yeast by up to 40 Å. Remarkably, the EM density for a large proportion of the intron sequences, both downstream and upstream of the lariat junction, is clearly visible (Figures S7B and S7C). This organization likely places the disordered portion of the lariat in contact with the two RecA domains of the RNA helicase Aquarius (De et al., 2015De I. Bessonov S. Hofele R. dos Santos K.

https://openalex.org/W2613825882,"We examined the evolutionary history of leading multidrug resistant hospital pathogens, the enterococci, to their origin hundreds of millions of years ago. Our goal was to understand why, among the vast diversity of gut flora, enterococci are so well adapted to the modern hospital environment. Molecular clock estimation, together with analysis of their environmental distribution, phenotypic diversity, and concordance with host fossil records, place the origins of the enterococci around the time of animal terrestrialization, 425-500 mya. Speciation appears to parallel the diversification of hosts, including the rapid emergence of new enterococcal species following the End Permian Extinction. Major drivers of speciation include changing carbohydrate availability in the host gut. Life on land would have selected for the precise traits that now allow pathogenic enterococci to survive desiccation, starvation, and disinfection in the modern hospital, foreordaining their emergence as leading hospital pathogens."

Moreover, gene order and gene sequences often differ substantially between cultivars of the same crop species. A major bottleneck for gene cloning in cereals is the generation of high-quality sequence information from a cultivar of interest. In order to accelerate gene cloning from any cropping line, we report 'targeted chromosome-based cloning via long-range assembly' (TACCA). TACCA combines lossless genome-complexity reduction via chromosome flow sorting with Chicago long-range linkage to assemble complex genomes. We applied TACCA to produce a high-quality (N50 of 9.76 Mb) de novo chromosome assembly of the wheat line CH Campala Lr22a in only 4 months. Using this assembly we cloned the broad-spectrum Lr22a leaf-rust resistance gene, using molecular marker information and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutants, and found that Lr22a encodes an intracellular immune receptor homologous to the Arabidopsis thaliana RPM1 protein."

We have examined the neural and behavioral correlates of novelty and familiarity in the olfactory system of Drosophila. Novel odors elicit strong activity in output neurons (MBONs) of the α'3 compartment of the mushroom body that is rapidly suppressed upon repeated exposure to the same odor. This transition in neural activity upon familiarization requires odor-evoked activity in the dopaminergic neuron innervating this compartment. Moreover, exposure of a fly to novel odors evokes an alerting response that can also be elicited by optogenetic activation of α'3 MBONs. Silencing these MBONs eliminates the alerting behavior. These data suggest that the α'3 compartment plays a causal role in the behavioral response to novel and familiar stimuli as a consequence of dopamine-mediated plasticity at the Kenyon cell-MBONα'3 synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2612730713,"Behavioral deficits in neurodegenerative diseases are often attributed to the selective dysfunction of vulnerable neurons via cell-autonomous mechanisms. Although vulnerable neurons are embedded in neuronal circuits, the contributions of their synaptic partners to disease process are largely unknown. Here we show that, in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a reduction in proprioceptive synaptic drive leads to motor neuron dysfunction and motor behavior impairments. In SMA mice or after the blockade of proprioceptive synaptic transmission, we observed a decrease in the motor neuron firing that could be explained by the reduction in the expression of the potassium channel Kv2.1 at the surface of motor neurons. Chronically increasing neuronal activity pharmacologically in vivo led to a normalization of Kv2.1 expression and an improvement in motor function. Our results demonstrate a key role of excitatory synaptic drive in shaping the function of motor neurons during development and the contribution of its disruption to a neurodegenerative disease."

However, the ability of fusion genes to be transduced by exosomes is unknown. We characterized exosomes from GBM cells harbouring and not harbouring PTPRZ1-MET fusion (ZM fusion). We also determined the effect of the exosomes from ZM fusion cells (ZM exosomes) on pro-oncogenic secretions and showed that ZM exosomes are internalized by the recipient cells. In addition, we studied the effect of ZM exosome-mediated intercellular communication in the GBM microenvironment. MET proto-oncogene expression was higher in ZM exosomes. Moreover, phosphorylated MET was detected only in ZM exosomes and not in exosomes released by non-ZM fusion GBM cells. ZM exosomes transferred to non-ZM fusion GBM cells and normal human astrocytes altered gene expression and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The uptake of ZM exosomes also induced an exosome-dependent phenotype defined by GBM cell migration and invasion, neurosphere growth and angiogenesis. In addition, ZM exosomes conferred temozolomide resistance to the GBM cells, and exosome-derived ZM fusion network proteins targeted multiple pro-oncogenic effectors in recipient cells within the GBM microenvironment. Our findings show that exosomes mediate the aggressive character of GBM and demonstrate the role of ZM fusion in the exacerbation of this effect. These findings have possible implications for the foundation of gene fusion-based therapy for managing GBM."

Nevertheless, the effects of plant based diets on the intestinal microbiome especially of juvenile Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are yet to be fully investigated. The present study demonstrates, based on 16S rDNA bacterial community profiling, that the intestinal microbiome of juvenile Rainbow trout is strongly affected by dietary plant protein inclusion levels. After first feeding of juveniles with either 0%, 50% or 97% of total dietary protein content derived from plants, statistically significant differences of the bacterial gut community for the three diet-types were detected, both at phylum and order level. The microbiome of juvenile fish consisted mainly of the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria, and thus fits the salmonid core microbiome suggested in previous studies. Dietary plant proteins significantly enhanced the relative abundance of the orders Lactobacillales, Bacillales and Pseudomonadales. Animal proteins in contrast significantly promoted Bacteroidales, Clostridiales, Vibrionales, Fusobacteriales and Alteromonadales. The overall alpha diversity significantly decreased with increasing plant protein inclusion levels and with age of experimental animals. In order to investigate permanent effects of the first feeding diet-type on the early development of the microbiome, a diet change was included in the study after 54 days, but no such effects could be detected. Instead, the microbiome of juvenile trout fry was highly dependent on the actual diet fed at the time of sampling."

They show that Tet1 deletion causes embryonic defects, which are partially penetrant in an inbred strain but fully lethal in non-inbred mice. The mammalian TET enzymes catalyze DNA demethylation. While they have been intensely studied as major epigenetic regulators, little is known about their physiological roles and the extent of functional redundancy following embryo implantation. Here we define non-redundant roles for TET1 at an early postimplantation stage of the mouse embryo, when its paralogs Tet2 and Tet3 are not detectably expressed. TET1 regulates numerous genes defining differentiation programs in the epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm. In epiblast cells, TET1 demethylates gene promoters via hydroxymethylation and maintains telomere stability. Surprisingly, TET1 represses a majority of epiblast target genes independently of methylation changes, in part through regulation of the gene encoding the transcriptional repressor JMJD8. Dysregulated gene expression in the absence of TET1 causes embryonic defects, which are partially penetrant in an inbred strain but fully lethal in non-inbred mice. Collectively, our study highlights an interplay between the catalytic and non-catalytic activities of TET1 that is essential for normal development."

Here we identify a previously unknown neuron type in the songbird brain that transmits vocal motor signals to the auditory cortex. Genetically ablating these neurons in juveniles disrupted their ability to imitate features of an adult tutor's song. Ablating these neurons in adults had little effect on previously learned songs but interfered with their ability to adaptively modify the duration of vocal elements and largely prevented the degradation of songs' temporal features that is normally caused by deafening.

We found that peripheral immune activation caused dendritic spine loss, impairments in learning-dependent dendritic spine formation and deficits in multiple learning tasks in mice. These observed synaptic alterations in the cortex were mediated by peripheral-monocyte-derived cells and did not require microglial function in the central nervous system. Furthermore, activation of CX3CR1highLy6Clow monocytes impaired motor learning and learning-related dendritic spine plasticity through tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-dependent mechanisms.

Speech comprehension results were analyzed and correlated to electrode length.While the FLEX20 ES and FLEX24 ES groups were still in their learning phase between the 3 to 6 months interval, the FLEX28 ES group was already reaching a performance plateau at the three months appointment yielding remarkably high test scores. EAS subjects using FLEX20 or FLEX24 electrodes outscored ES-only subjects with the same short electrodes on all 3 tests at each interval, reaching significance with FLEX20 ES and FLEX24 ES subjects on all 3 tests at the 3-months interval and on 2 tests at the 6- months interval.

Here we show that VEGFA induction of Sox2 promotes EMT and tumor metastasis. In breast lines and primary cancer culture, VEGFA rapidly upregulates SOX2 expression, leading to SNAI2 induction, EMT, increased invasion and metastasis. We show Sox2 downregulates miR-452, which acts as a novel metastasis suppressor to directly target the SNAI2 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). VEGFA stimulates Sox2- and Slug-dependent cell invasion. VEGFA increases lung metastasis in vivo, and this is abrogated by miR-452 overexpression. Furthermore, SNAI2 transduction rescues metastasis suppression by miR-452. Thus, in addition to its angiogenic action, VEGFA upregulates Sox2 to drive stem cell expansion, together with miR-452 loss and Slug upregulation, providing a novel mechanism whereby cancer stem cells acquire metastatic potential. Prior work showed EMT transcription factor overexpression upregulates CSC. Present work indicates that stemness and metastasis are a two-way street: Sox2, a major mediator of CSC self-renewal, also governs the metastatic process."

Genomic rearrangements are a hallmark of human cancers. Here, we identify the piggyBac transposable element derived 5 (PGBD5) gene as encoding an active DNA transposase expressed in the majority of childhood solid tumors, including lethal rhabdoid tumors. Using assembly-based whole-genome DNA sequencing, we found previously undefined genomic rearrangements in human rhabdoid tumors. These rearrangements involved PGBD5-specific signal (PSS) sequences at their breakpoints and recurrently inactivated tumor-suppressor genes. PGBD5 was physically associated with genomic PSS sequences that were also sufficient to mediate PGBD5-induced DNA rearrangements in rhabdoid tumor cells. Ectopic expression of PGBD5 in primary immortalized human cells was sufficient to promote cell transformation in vivo. This activity required specific catalytic residues in the PGBD5 transposase domain as well as end-joining DNA repair and induced structural rearrangements with PSS breakpoints.

NF-E2 related factor-2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of antioxidant response is implicated in chemoresistance in solid tumors. However, little is known about the role of Nrf2 in AML chemoresistance and the effect of pharmacological inhibitor brusatol in modulating this resistance. Primary AML samples with high ex-vivo IC50 to Ara-C, ATO, Dnr had significantly high NRF2 RNA expression. Gene-specific knockdown of NRF2 improved sensitivity to these drugs in resistant AML cell lines by decreasing the expression of downstream antioxidant targets of Nrf2 by compromising the cell's ability to scavenge the ROS. Treatment with brusatol, a pharmacological inhibitor of Nrf2, improved sensitivity to Ara-C, ATO, and Dnr and reduced colony formation capacity. AML cell lines stably overexpressing NRF2 showed increased resistance to ATO, Dnr and Ara-C and increased expression of downstream targets. This study demonstrates that Nrf2 could be an ideal druggable target in AML, more so to the drugs that function through ROS, suggesting the possibility of using Nrf2 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutic agents to modulate drug resistance in AML."

In addition, the possible role of some anti-diabetic drugs in the neuro-protection processes and their effect in combination with NSO and/or the insulin receptor inhibitor IOMe-AG538 were investigated.T2DM-induced rats were orally and daily administrated 2.0 ml NSO, 100 mg metformin (MT), 0.8 mg glimepiride (GI) and different combinations (100 mg MT & 2.0 ml NSO, 0.8 mg GI & 2.0 ml NSO and 2.0 ml NSO & intraperitoneal injection of 1/100 LD50 of IOMe-AG538) per kg body weight for 21 days.A significant increase in the brain lipid peroxidation and decrease in the antioxidant status with peripheral and central production of pro-inflammatory mediators were observed in diabetes-induced rats. The brain AChE was activated and associated with diminished brain glucose level and cholinergic function. In addition, the brain insulin resistance and the attenuated insulin signaling pathway (p-IRS/ p-AKT/p-GSK-3β) were accompanied by an augmentation in GSK-3β level, which in turn may contribute in the extensive alterations of Tau phosphorylation along with changes in PP2A level. Furthermore, neuronal loss and elevation in Aβ-42 plaque formation were observed due to a low IDE formation and an increased expression of p53, BACE1 and APP with diminished ADAM10, SIRT1 and BDNF levels. The expression profile of AD-related miRNAs in sera and brain tissues displayed its neuro-protection role. The treatment of diabetes-induced rats with NSO and the anti-diabetic drugs alone and/or in combination have the potential to suppress the oxidative stress, the pro-inflammatory mediators and amyloidogenic pathway. Moreover, it lowers the insulin receptor inhibitory effect of IOMe-AG538 and modifies the insulin-signaling pathway. Therefore, it prevents the neurotoxicity, amyloid plaque formation and Tau hyper-phosphorylation and restores AD-related miRNA normal levels.These data suggest that NSO or its combined treatments with anti-diabetic drugs have a possible benefit as disease modifying agents for the insulin resistance in the brain through enhancing brain insulin signaling pathway."

The discovery of inhibitors of methyl- and acetyl-binding domains has provided evidence for the 'druggability' of epigenetic effector molecules. The small-molecule probe UNC1215 prevents methyl-dependent protein-protein interactions by engaging the aromatic cage of MBT domains and, with lower affinity, Tudor domains. Using a library of tagged UNC1215 analogs, we screened a protein-domain microarray of human methyllysine effector molecules to rapidly detect compounds with new binding profiles with either increased or decreased specificity. Using this approach, we identified a compound (EML405) that acquired a novel interaction with the Tudor-domain-containing protein Spindlin1 (SPIN1). Structural studies facilitated the rational synthesis of SPIN1 inhibitors with increased selectivity (EML631–633), which engage SPIN1 in cells, block its ability to 'read' H3K4me3 marks and inhibit its transcriptional-coactivator activity. Protein microarrays can thus be used as a platform to 'target-hop' and identify small molecules that bind and compete with domain-motif interactions."

On the single-neuron level, surround input profoundly alters response amplitude and modulates spatial preference in the cortex. On the population level, surround input organizes the spatial preference of neurons into a continuous map of the space swept out by the whiskers. These data demonstrate how spatial summation over a moving sensor array is critical to generating population codes of sensory space. During active sensation, sensors scan space in order to generate a representation of the outside world. However, since spatial coding in sensory systems is typically addressed by measuring receptive fields in a fixed, sensor-based coordinate frame, the cortical representation of scanned space is poorly understood. To address this question, we probed spatial coding in the rodent whisker system using a combination of two-photon imaging and electrophysiology during active touch. We found that surround whiskers powerfully transform the cortical representation of scanned space. On the single-neuron level, surround input profoundly alters response amplitude and modulates spatial preference in the cortex. On the population level, surround input organizes the spatial preference of neurons into a continuous map of the space swept out by the whiskers. These data demonstrate how spatial summation over a moving sensor array is critical to generating population codes of sensory space. Cortical neurons represent sensory space through topographic projections of the peripheral sense organs, creating maps of the physical world in the brain. Sensory coding through maps is thought to make both the structure and function of neural circuits more efficient (Knudsen et al., 1987Knudsen E.I. du Lac S. Esterly S.D. Computational maps in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 41-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In passive systems, maps can be probed by systematically stimulating different parts of the sensor array and measuring the receptive fields of individual neurons. In many sensory systems, such as the retina, integration over the sensor array is critical for receptive field formation (Hartline et al., 1956Hartline H.K. Wagner H.G. Ratliff F. Inhibition in the eye of Limulus.J. Gen. Physiol. 1956; 39: 651-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, Kuffler, 1953Kuffler S.W. Discharge patterns and functional organization of mammalian retina.J. Neurophysiol. 1953; 16: 37-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). During active sensation, however, the sensors themselves move, scanning space to provide greater coverage of the outside world (Kleinfeld et al., 2006Kleinfeld D. Ahissar E. Diamond M.E. Active sensation: insights from the rodent vibrissa sensorimotor system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). How neurons in the cortex encode scanned space, and whether integration across the sensor array is involved, are not known. Furthermore, sensor scanning has the potential to create its own spatial map in the cortex, not of the sensor array itself but of the space swept out by the sensors. Such a map of scanned space could provide a basis for fine object localization and identification needed for behaviors such as prey capture, predator avoidance, and navigation. The rodent whisker system is an advantageous system to address this question (Brecht, 2007Brecht M. Barrel cortex and whisker-mediated behaviors.Curr. Opin.

On one hand, the topographic and discretized representation of the rodent’s whiskers along the sensory hierarchy facilitates detailed analysis for how sensory neurons perform multi-whisker integration (Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970Woolsey T.A.

On the other, the stereotyped pattern of whisking during spatial exploration facilitates investigation into the sensorimotor processes underlying active sensation (Diamond et al., 2008Diamond M.E. von Heimendahl M.

An artificial whisking paradigm in anesthetized animals has allowed investigators to probe spatial coding during active touch, albeit in a reduced brain state (Brown and Waite, 1974Brown A.W.

Surprisingly, despite the well-ordered anatomical topography of the barrels in L4 (Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970Woolsey T.A. Van der Loos H. The structural organization of layer IV in the somatosensory region (SI) of mouse cerebral cortex. The description of a cortical field composed of discrete cytoarchitectonic units.Brain Res. 1970; 17: 205-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar), two-photon imaging in layer 2/3 (L2/3) has revealed that on the cellular scale, the whisker map breaks down, exhibiting a salt and pepper tuning for whisker preference (Clancy et al., 2015Clancy K.B. Schnepel P. Rao A.T. Feldman D.E. Structure of a single whisker representation in layer 2 of mouse somatosensory cortex.J.

The functional microarchitecture of the mouse barrel cortex.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e189Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similar receptive field studies in other rodent cortical areas, such as the auditory and visual cortices, have also found local breakdowns in maps of sensory space (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010Bandyopadhyay S.

Häusser M. Parallel processing of visual space by neighboring neurons in mouse visual cortex.Nat.

Garcia-Junco-Clemente P. Trachtenberg J.T. Spatial clustering of tuning in mouse primary visual cortex.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12270Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, these works analyzed maps of a fixed sensor array and not of scanned space. It remains uncertain whether an orderly map of scanned space exists in the barrel cortex or elsewhere. During active touch, barrel cortex neurons are often well tuned to the horizontal location of an object (Pluta et al., 2015Pluta S. Naka A. Veit J. Telian G. Yao L. Hakim R. Taylor D. Adesnik H. A direct translaminar inhibitory circuit tunes cortical output.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2015Yu C. Horev G. Rubin N. Derdikman D.

Multiple mechanisms potentially contribute to their tuning. These include selectivity for the phase (Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009Curtis J.C. Kleinfeld D. Phase-to-rate transformations encode touch in cortical neurons of a scanning sensorimotor system.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), deflection angle (Knutsen et al., 2008Knutsen P.M. Biess A. Ahissar E.

Whisking kinematics enables object localization in head-centered coordinates based on tactile information from a single vibrissa.Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2016; 10: 145Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) at the moment of touch. These schemes can all operate at the single-whisker level and do not require multi-whisker integration, which is likely to occur in most natural contexts. Several studies have found that rodents perform better on whisker-guided behaviors when using multiple whiskers, suggesting that multi-whisker integration is critical for perceptual acuity (Knutsen et al., 2006Knutsen P.M.

Vibrissa-based object localization in head-fixed mice.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1947-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although spatial summation is not required for spatial tuning per se, multi-whisker integration could powerfully transform the cortical representation of space. This might be particularly true during active sensing, where neighboring sensors probe overlapping regions of space. This raises the possibility that multi-whisker integration during active sensing might transform a discretized vibrissotopic map into a continuous map of scanned space that could be highly advantageous for object localization and discrimination. Whether such a map exists in the barrel cortex, and, more specifically, how multi-whisker integration could shape its organization, are unknown. Most prior studies of the barrel cortex during active sensation have either been done in unrestrained animals, when controlling the stimulus is challenging, or in head-fixed mice where only a single whisker is left intact. One study in unrestrained animals quantified tactile responses before and after removing select whiskers surrounding the principal whisker (PW) column and found opposing effects in the cortex and the thalamus (Kelly et al., 1999Kelly M.K. Carvell G.E. Kodger J.M. Simons D.J. Sensory loss by selected whisker removal produces immediate disinhibition in the somatosensory cortex of behaving rats.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9117-9125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet in these freely behaving conditions, precise measurements of neuronal receptive fields could not be obtained. We used two-photon imaging and multi-electrode array physiology to address spatial summation and map organization in the somatosensory thalamocortical system. First, we tracked how spatial summation evolves across four stages of the sensory hierarchy, from the thalamus through three cortical layers. We found that neurons in the cortex, but not in the thalamus, exhibited an asymmetric, rostro-caudal gradient of summation over surround whiskers. Surround modulation not only had dramatic impacts on firing rates but also generated a heterogeneous and substantial shift in the spatial preference of most neurons. On the population level, our data reveal a highly ordered and continuous map of scanned space in L2/3 of the barrel cortex. This map was nearly absent when only a single whisker was intact, indicating that summation over surrounding whiskers is critical to map organization. These data demonstrate that multi-whisker integration in the cortex organizes the spatial preference of neurons to create a continuous map of scanned space. Maps of scanned space may contribute to high-fidelity encoding of the location and shape of objects during natural exploration. To address how barrel cortex neurons encode scanned space and summate over whiskers in naturally whisking mice, we employed a head-fixed preparation in which mice ran on a free-spinning circular treadmill while we presented a vertical bar to the whiskers at fixed locations for 1.5 s (Figure 1A). Mice were habituated to run for extended periods, a condition in which they move their whiskers in a highly rhythmic fashion (Pluta et al., 2015Pluta S. Naka A. Veit J. Telian G. Yao L. Hakim R. Taylor D. Adesnik H. A direct translaminar inhibitory circuit tunes cortical output.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, Sofroniew et al., 2014Sofroniew N.J. Cohen J.D. Lee A.K. Svoboda K. Natural whisker-guided behavior by head-fixed mice in tactile virtual reality.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 9537-9550Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Figure 1G). Under these conditions, we could measure and quantify spatial representations with high precision. Neural activity was recorded with two-photon calcium imaging in the upper cortical layers or multi-electrode arrays in the lower cortical layers and the ventro-posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPM). Neural data were analyzed in the final 500 ms of stimulus presentation, during which neural activity and whisking kinematics had returned to a stable state after abrupt positioning of the stimulus bar (Figure S1). Experimental trials were selected based on the velocity and consistency of treadmill running to minimize variation in whisking behavior (Figure S1E; STAR Methods). This strict sampling of running behavior ensured consistent, repetitive touches with the stimulus throughout the object presentation period (Figure S1F). Prior to each experiment, we first identified the location of the C2 whisker’s representation in each mouse using intrinsic optical imaging. In both imaging and electrophysiology experiments, we found neurons across all layers of the barrel cortex whose tactile-evoked responses were tuned to the horizontal location of the vertical pole (Figures 1B–1D). By labeling a single PW in a subset of mice with reflective paint, we could track this whisker reliably in the presence of all other whiskers (Figures 1E–1H and S1). Using high-speed whisker tracking we found that across the full “whisking field,” the PW made rhythmic contact with the stimulus bar throughout the stimulus period at central locations, but not lateral locations, where only adjacent whiskers (AWs) contacted the bar, defining a PW contact zone (PWCZ) and an adjacent whisker contact zone (AWCZ; Figures 1E and 1F). To explore spatial summation during active sensation, we sought to quantify the contribution of the PW and the AWs to each neuron’s spatial representation. We reasoned that we could measure this by comparing a neuron’s spatial tuning function before and after acutely trimming off all the surround whiskers. The difference in these two measurements would reveal the parallel contributions of the AWs and PW to each neuron’s spatial receptive field. Toward this aim, we collected spatial tuning curves both before and after trimming all but the PW in a single experimental session (<1 hr), so that after trimming, only the PW could contact the stimulus bar. Importantly, whisker trimming on such an acute timescale is much shorter than required for the induction of sensory-deprivation-induced plasticity (Bender et al., 2006Bender K.J. Allen C.B.

Initiation, labile, and stabilization phases of experience-dependent plasticity at neocortical synapses.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 8483-8493Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The dataset consisted of 1,016 neurons in L4 (340 ± 120 regions of interest [ROIs] per mouse; three mice), 2,572 neurons in L2/3 (640 ± 120 ROIs per mouse; four mice), 172 regular spiking (RS) units in L5 (10 ± 2 units per mouse; 16 mice), and 90 units in VPM (11 ± 2 per mouse; eight mice). Since acute whisker trimming might alter an animal’s pattern of whisking during active sensation, in a subset of mice, we tracked the PW both before and after surround whisker trimming and found that trimming did not significantly alter the kinematics of the animals’ whisking patterns, except for a minute difference in amplitude (Figure S1; mean ± SEM: 0.90 ± 0.20 degrees, far smaller than the 10–15 degrees between presented stimuli). This indicates that any changes we observed in neuronal response functions were due to changes in neural computation and not to changes in whisking behavior. First we addressed spatial coding and summation in excitatory neurons in L4 of the barrel cortex. To record from a large population of L4 excitatory neurons across the spatial map in S1, we expressed GCaMP6s (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A.

A direct translaminar inhibitory circuit tunes cortical output.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Prior to whisker trimming, we observed contact-evoked responses across the entire imaging field. Following removal of the surround whiskers, sensory evoked responses were essentially abolished outside of the PW “column” (68% ± 9% decrease in number of significantly driven units, n = 3 mice; for column identification, see STAR Methods and Figure S2), demonstrating that the PW preferentially drives touch responses within its anatomically aligned column, consistent with prior observations under both passive and active conditions (Goldreich et al., 1999Goldreich D.

Low-noise encoding of active touch by layer 4 in the somatosensory cortex.eLife. 2015; 4: 4Google Scholar). Strikingly, in the rostral position of the PWCZ the majority (56% ± 8%, n = 3 mice) of L4 neurons within the PW column exhibited significant enhancements in their contact-evoked activity following surround whisker trimming (4.0-fold ± 1.3-fold increase in population mean, n = 231, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.001; Figures 2B–2E). We computed a “trimming index” as a metric for how surround whiskers influenced the evoked firing rate of each given neuron, defined as the difference over the sum of evoked activity between pre- and post-trimming conditions. In the rostral PWCZ position, nearly all neurons had a positive trimming index, indicating pronounced disinhibition following surround whisker trimming (trimming index = 0.33 ± 0.03, n = 231, p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank text; Figure 2F). In contrast, in the caudal PWCZ position, most neurons showed a reduction in tactile evoked response (0.8-fold ± 0.1-fold decrease in population mean, trimming index = −0.30 ± 0.03, n = 231, p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure 2F). These data indicate that surround input from more caudal whiskers provides facilitation, whereas input from the more rostral whiskers primarily provides suppression. To address how surround whisker input influences spatial coding, we computed an index of spatial preference (the center of mass of the spatial tuning curve in the PWCZ). We found that for nearly all L4 neurons that exhibited spatial tuning (one-way ANOVA), spatial preference shifted forward (1.77 ± 0.09 mm mean shift, n = 139, p < 0.001, t test; Figure 2G). Next, we addressed spatial coding and summation in L2/3 and L5, the two major output layers of the barrel cortex. In L2/3, we used two-photon imaging (110–195 μm deep) to sample a large number of L2/3 neurons across the spatial map in S1. In L5, we employed laminar multi-channel electrodes that spanned the complete depth of L5. The laminar position of the electrode in each experiment was confirmed with a combination of depth readings off a precise mi"

Heme binding to Rev-erbβ indirectly facilitates its interaction with the nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR1), resulting in repression of Rev-erbβ target genes. Fe3+-heme binds in a 6-coordinate complex with axial His and Cys ligands, the latter provided by a heme-regulatory motif (HRM). Rev-erbβ was thought to be a heme sensor based on a weak Kd value for the Rev-erbβ·heme complex of 2 μm determined with isothermal titration calorimetry. However, our group demonstrated with UV-visible difference titrations that the Kd value is in the low nanomolar range, and the Fe3+-heme off-rate is on the order of 10−6 s−1 making Rev-erbβ ineffective as a sensor of Fe3+-heme. In this study, we dissected the kinetics of heme binding to Rev-erbβ and provided a Kd for Fe3+-heme of ∼0.1 nm. Loss of the HRM axial thiolate via redox processes, including oxidation to a disulfide with a neighboring cysteine or dissociation upon reduction of Fe3+- to Fe2+-heme, decreased binding affinity by >20-fold. Furthermore, as measured in a co-immunoprecipitation assay, substitution of the His or Cys heme ligands in Rev-erbβ was accompanied by a significant loss of NCoR1 binding. These results demonstrate the importance of the Rev-erbβ HRM in regulating interactions with heme and NCoR1 and advance our understanding of how signaling through HRMs affects the major cellular processes of circadian rhythm maintenance and metabolism.

Heme (Fe-protoporphyrin IX) is a versatile protein cofactor that can adopt a wide range of redox potentials and reactivities depending on its environment (1Chapman S.K. Daff S. Munro A.W. Hill H.A.O. Sadler P.J. Thomson A.J. Metal Sites in Proteins and Models: Iron Centres. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Berlin1997: 39-70Google Scholar). As a result, heme plays a critical role in many cellular processes, including electron transport during oxidative phosphorylation, binding oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin, and generating high valence and reactive iron-oxo species in enzymes such as cytochrome P450s (2Tsiftsoglou A.S.

In contrast to its archetypal role as a cofactor, recent studies have implicated heme as an important signaling molecule regulating diverse pathways ranging from heme biosynthesis to circadian rhythm maintenance (3Mense S.M.

HRM-containing proteins regulate key metabolic pathways; for example, the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis, aminolevulinic acid synthase-1, contains three HRMs that mediate its mitochondrial import, maturation, and facilitate its degradation (4Kubota Y.

BACH1, a mammalian transcription factor and repressor of heme-oxygenase 1 and α/β globin genes, harbors six HRMs, several of which bind heme and inhibit DNA binding and target the protein for degradation (13Zenke-Kawasaki Y.

Time for food: the intimate interplay between nutrition, metabolism, and the circadian clock.Cell. 2015; 161: 84-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, cells are entrained to a diurnal cycle by factors, including light and feeding. At the molecular level, these signals are integrated into a set of core clock proteins that form a transcription-translation feedback loop (23Takahashi J.S. Molecular components of the circadian clock in mammals.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2015; 17: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Two of these proteins, Bmal1 and CLOCK (or NPAS2), form a heterodimeric complex that activates transcription of clock-controlled genes. Although NPAS2 does not harbor an HRM, it binds heme and CO, which regulate its DNA-binding activity (24Dioum E.M. Rutter J. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.-A. McKnight S.L. NPAS2: a gas-responsive transcription factor.Science. 2002; 298: 2385-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar); NPAS2 is also a redox sensor that integrates energy metabolism into the circadian cycle by sensing changes in the NAD+/NADH couple (25Rutter J. Reick M. Wu L.C. McKnight S.L. Regulation of clock and NPAS2 DNA binding by the redox state of NAD cofactors.Science. 2001; 293: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Genes activated by Bmal1·CLOCK include per1, per2, and per3 (encoding Period 1, 2, and 3), and cry1 and cry2 (encoding Cryptochromes 1 and 2), Rev-erbα, and Rev-erbβ. Although Period and Cryptochrome proteins heterodimerize and feedback to inhibit the activator function of the Bmal1·CLOCK complex, Rev-erbs are potent repressors of both Bmal1 and CLOCK genes (23Takahashi J.S.

Direct regulation of CLOCK expression by REV-ERB.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17290Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Rev-erbs belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily, a group of ligand-responsive transcription factors that include receptors of steroid hormones like estrogen and testosterone. Nuclear receptors have a conserved modular structure consisting of a DNA-binding domain harboring two 4-Cys zinc fingers, a flexible hinge region, and an adjoining globular ligand-binding domain (LBD). In addition to their role as circadian factors, Rev-erbs repress the transcription of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory pathways, entraining these processes to the molecular clock (5Yin L.

Rev-erbs do so by interacting with the nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR1), which recruits histone deacetylase complexes to the promoters of target genes. Our group and others have shown that Rev-erbs bind heme, which indirectly facilitates the interaction with NCoR1 and has a modest effect on promoting degradation (5Yin L. Wu N. Curtin J.C.

Rev-erbs bind Fe3+-heme in a 6-coordinate complex with conserved His and Cys residues, the latter provided by an HRM (36Pardee K.I. Xu X. Reinking J. Schuetz A. Dong A. Liu S. Zhang R. Tiefenbach J.

The structural basis of gas-responsive transcription by the human nuclear hormone receptor REV-ERBβ.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Previously, our group reported that under oxidizing conditions, the Rev-erbβ HRM axial thiolate, Cys-384, forms a disulfide with neighboring Cys-374 lowering heme affinity from 23 to 117 nm (37Gupta N. Ragsdale S.W. Thiol-disulfide redox dependence of heme binding and heme ligand switching in nuclear hormone receptor Rev-erbβ.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4392-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, reduction of Fe3+-heme to Fe2+-heme is accompanied by dissociation of the HRM axial thiolate to a mixed 5/6 coordinate system (38Marvin K.A. Reinking J.L. Lee A.J. Pardee K. Krause H.M. Burstyn J.N. Nuclear receptors Homo sapiens Rev-erbβ and Drosophila melanogaster E75 are thiolate-ligated heme proteins which undergo redox-mediated ligand switching and bind CO and NO.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7056-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); however, based on equilibrium titrations, this iron redox change appears to have little effect on heme affinity (37Gupta N.

Chem. 2011; 286: 4392-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the various activities of Rev-erbs, e.g. heme-binding, repression, and degradation, may be modulated by thiol-disulfide conversion or heme redox state. In this paper, we further investigate the role of the HRM thiolate in regulating Rev-erbβ activity. Utilizing stopped-flow UV-visible spectrophotometry and myoglobin competition assays, we dissected the kinetics of Fe3+- and Fe2+-heme binding to Rev-erbβ. These studies were performed in a unique buffer system containing caffeine, which we and others have found to stabilize monomeric heme and allow for the determination of second-order on-rates for heme binding (39Kawamura-Konishi Y. Suzuki H. Binding reaction of hemin to globin.J. Biochem. 1985; 98: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 40Pasternack R.F. Gibbs E.J. Hoeflin E. Kosar W.P. Kubera G. Skowronek C.A.

Elliott W.B. Caffeine derivatives of haematin compounds.Biochem. J. 1967; 105: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses provide Kd values for Fe3+-heme in the picomolar range, far lower than those previously reported using equilibrium-based methods. Significantly, loss of the HRM heme axial thiolate by disulfide bond formation or by reduction of Fe3+- to Fe2+-heme has a major effect on lowering heme affinity (by at least 20-fold but by as much as 4 orders of magnitude). Furthermore, substitution of the cysteine thiolate in the HRM with an alanine significantly diminishes NCoR1 binding in a co-immunoprecipitation assay, suggesting the Rev-erbβ HRM is critical for stabilizing the co-repressor complex. These results implicate redox processes, including thiol-disulfide conversion and heme oxidation state, as regulatory mechanisms controlling Rev-erb heme occupancy, repressor activity, and ultimately circadian rhythm and metabolism. Previous equilibrium titrations yielded Kd values for Fe3+-heme complexes with wild-type and C384A LBDs of 23 ± 3 and 46 ± 14 nm (Table 1), respectively, suggesting the axial thiolate has a minor impact on heme affinity (37Gupta N. Ragsdale S.W. Thiol-disulfide redox dependence of heme binding and heme ligand switching in nuclear hormone receptor Rev-erbβ.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 4392-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, recent studies from our laboratory have shown that equilibrium-based methods for determining heme affinities are inaccurate. Standard assays for measuring heme Kd values, such as UV-visible spectrophotometric titrations, use micromolar concentrations of heme and protein. Because heme Kd values are generally low nanomolar and below, during the titration the majority of heme is protein-bound; therefore, the concentration of free heme cannot be assumed to be equal to that of total heme. The expansion of the simple hyperbolic binding curve to include the concentration of free ligand leads to a quadratic form that has been used to fit tight-binding stoichiometric data like those acquired with heme titrations (originally described by Morrison (42Morrison J.F. Kinetics of the reversible inhibition of enzyme-catalysed reactions by tight-binding inhibitors.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar)). In our experience, the quadratic fit is also limited in that its accuracy depends on the sharpness of the curve around the point of saturation. When Kd is in the single digit nanomolar range and below, the standard error of the quadratic fit is too high to yield an accurate estimation; therefore, the quadratic equation yields only the upper limit of the Kd value (35Carter E.L.

Instead, analysis of heme-binding kinetics provides the most accurate estimation of affinity. Thus, assessing the effect of redox changes on the affinity of Rev-erbβ for heme required the development of a kinetic system to establish accurate Kd values. As described below, by measuring the dissociation (koff) and association (kon) rate constants for interactions of Rev-erbβ with Fe3+-heme, we obtained Kd (koff/kon) values that are significantly lower than reported previously.Table 1Comparison of Rev-erbα/β, HO2(1-248), and myoglobin/hemoglobin dissociation constants obtained with different methodsa Heme oxidation state and the presence or absence of caffeine is indicated in parentheses.b On-rates in parentheses are calculated from kobs2 (see Fig. 3).c All off-rate data in this study and in Ref. 35Carter E.L.

Thus, we generated and purified a truncated construct (the LBD) consisting of an N-terminal MBP solubility tag fused to Rev-erbβ residues 370–579. The LBD exhibits heme Kd values similar to those of FLRev-erbβ (35Carter E.L. Gupta N. Ragsdale S.W.

The fusion protein was proteolytically digested, and the LBD was isolated for transient kinetic experiments. The second major barrier to overcome in these kinetic studies related to the propensity of heme to form π-π stacked dimers in aqueous solution (44de Villiers K.A. Kaschula C.H. Egan T.J. Marques H.M.

To ensure that our experiments were performed with monomeric heme solutions, we used methylxanthine (caffeine), which prevents heme dimerization (41Gallagher W.A. Elliott W.B.

Rapid mixing of Fe3+-heme with varying concentrations of thiol-reduced LBD (thiol-RED; 370–579 contains two Cys residues, Cys-384 and Cys-374, that exist in the dithiol state, see under “Experimental procedures” for details) in 0.5× TNG buffer produced spectral changes consistent with heme binding to Rev-erbβ, namely formation of the Soret band centered at 423 nm (Fig. 1A). The 423-nm kinetic traces fit best to a quadruple exponential equation, but none of the observed rate constants were dependent on [LBD] (Fig. 1, A, inset, and B) suggesting that a rate-limiting first-order process precedes axial ligation of heme, undoubtedly the dissociation of the heme dimer or higher oligomers. Similar observations have been made with hemoglobin binding free heme in aqueous solution, which is also thought to be due to heme oligomer dissociation (47Gibson Q.H. Antonini E.

https://openalex.org/W2613909613,"Objectives Associations between androgens and depressive symptoms were mostly reported from cross-sectional and patient-based studies. Study design/main outcome measures Longitudinal data from 4,110 participants of the Study of Health in Pomerania were used to assess sex-specific associations of baseline total and free testosterone, androstenedione and sex hormone-binding globulin with incident depressive symptoms and cognitive status at 5- and 10-year follow-up. Results Despite sex-specific differences in depressive symptoms prevalence at baseline (women: 17.4%, men: 8.1%), cross-sectional analyses showed no associations between sex hormones and depressive symptoms. In age-adjusted longitudinal analyses, total testosterone was associated with incident depressive symptoms (relative risk at 5-year follow-up: 0.73, 95% confidence interval: 0.58–0.92). Similarly, age-adjusted analyses showed a positive association between sex hormone-binding globulin and cognitive status in men (β-coefficient per standard deviation: 0.44, 95% confidence interval: 0.13–0.74). In women, age-adjusted associations of androstenedione with baseline depressive symptoms (relative risk: 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.77–0.99) were found. None of the observed associations remained after multivariable adjustment. Conclusions The present population-based, longitudinal study revealed inverse associations between sex hormones and depressive symptoms. However, the null finding after multivariable adjustment suggests, that the observed associations were not independent of relevant confounders including body mass index, smoking and physical inactivity. Furthermore, the low number of incident endpoints in our non-clinical population-based sample limited the statistical power and reduced the chance to detect a statistically significant effect."
https://openalex.org/W2612927433,"Enterocytozoon bieneusi has been increasingly reported in non-human primates (NHPs) in recent years, and this has garnered attention. However, reports of E. bieneusi infections in NHPs are limited worldwide. To appreciate the genetic diversity and assess the zoonotic potential during the transmission of human microsporidiosis, we examined a total of 369 fecal samples from NHPs and performed PCR amplification of the ITS gene of E. bieneusi. An infection rate of 12.5% (46/369) was detected in NHPs, with three known genotypes (D, PigEBITS7, and SC02) and a novel genotype (SCM01) characterized. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all four genotypes in our study were classified as zoonotic group 1. Multilocus genotyping of positive E. bieneusi strains revealed that 36, 37, 30, and 29 specimens were successfully amplified and sequenced to generate 16, six, four, and five types of MS1, MS3, MS4, and MS7 loci, respectively. Twenty-four specimens were successfully amplified and sequenced at all four loci, forming 13 multilocus genotypes (MLGs). The occurrence of zoonotic genotypes suggests that zoonotic transmission of E. bieneusi between humans and NHPs has probably occurred and NHPs could be a source of human microspordiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2613284188,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women, with the majority of these deaths caused by metastasis to distant organs. The most common site of breast cancer metastasis is the bone, which has been shown to provide a rich microenvironment that supports the migration and growth of breast cancer cells. Additionally, growing evidence suggests that breast cancer cells that do successfully metastasize have a stem-like phenotype including high activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and/or a CD44+CD24- phenotype. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that these ALDHhiCD44+CD24- breast cancer cells interact with factors in the bone secondary organ microenvironment to facilitate metastasis. Specifically, we focused on bone-derived osteopontin and its ability to promote the migration and stem-like phenotype of breast cancer cells. Our results indicate that bone-derived osteopontin promotes the migration, tumorsphere-forming ability and colony-forming ability of whole population and ALDHhiCD44+CD24- breast cancer cells in bone marrow-conditioned media (an ex vivo representation of the bone microenvironment) (p≤0.05). We also demonstrate that CD44 and RGD-dependent cell surface integrins facilitate this functional response to bone-derived osteopontin (p≤0.05), potentially through activation of WNK-1 and PRAS40-related pathways. Our findings suggest that soluble bone-derived osteopontin enhances the ability of breast cancer cells to migrate to the bone and maintain a stem-like phenotype within the bone microenvironment, and this may contribute to the establishment and growth of bone metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2613516933,"The contribution of RNA processing to tumorigenesis is understudied. Here, we report that the human RNA debranching enzyme (hDBR1), when inappropriately regulated, induces oncogenesis by causing RNA processing defects, for example, splicing defects. We found that wild-type p53 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 co-regulate hDBR1 expression, and insufficient hDBR1 leads to a higher rate of exon skipping. Transcriptomic sequencing confirmed the effect of hDBR1 on RNA splicing, and metabolite profiling supported the observation that neoplasm is triggered by a decrease in hDBR1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, when modulating the expression of hDBR1, which was found to be generally low in malignant human tissues, higher expression of hDBR1 only affected exon-skipping activity in malignant cells. Together, our findings demonstrate previously unrecognized regulation and functions of hDBR1, with immediate clinical implications regarding the regulation of hDBR1 as an effective strategy for combating human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2612528408,"Accelerated weathering exposures were performed on poly(ethylene-terephthalate) (PET) films. Longitudinal multi-level predictive models as a function of PET grades and exposure types were developed for the change in yellowness index (YI) and haze (%). Exposures with similar change in YI were modeled using a linear fixed-effects modeling approach. Due to the complex nature of haze formation, measurement uncertainty, and the differences in the samples' responses, the change in haze (%) depended on individual samples' responses and a linear mixed-effects modeling approach was used. When compared to fixed-effects models, the addition of random effects in the haze formation models significantly increased the variance explained. For both modeling approaches, diagnostic plots confirmed independence and homogeneity with normally distributed residual errors. Predictive R2 values for true prediction error and predictive power of the models demonstrated that the models were not subject to over-fitting. These models enable prediction under pre-defined exposure conditions for a given exposure time (or photo-dosage in case of UV light exposure). PET degradation under cyclic exposures combining UV light and condensing humidity is caused by photolytic and hydrolytic mechanisms causing yellowing and haze formation. Quantitative knowledge of these degradation pathways enable cross-correlation of these lab-based exposures with real-world conditions for service life prediction."

The effects of developmental nicotine exposure are known, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism that can be used for uncovering genetic and molecular mechanisms for drugs of abuse. Here I show that Drosophila can be a model to elucidate the mechanisms for nicotine's effects on a developing organism. Drosophila reared on nicotine food display developmental and behavioral effects similar to those in mammals including decreased survival and weight, increased developmental time, and decreased sensitivity to acute nicotine and ethanol. The Drosophila nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 7 (Dα7) mediates some of these effects. A novel role for Dα7 on ethanol sedation in Drosophila is also shown. Future research taking advantage of the genetic and molecular tools for Drosophila will allow additional discovery of the mechanisms behind the effects of nicotine during development."
https://openalex.org/W2616171702,"The proto-oncogene PTTG and its binding partner PBF have been widely studied in multiple cancer types, particularly thyroid and colorectal, but their combined role in tumourigenesis is uncharacterised. Here, we show for the first time that together PTTG and PBF significantly modulate DNA damage response (DDR) genes, including p53 target genes, required to maintain genomic integrity in thyroid cells. Critically, DDR genes were extensively repressed in primary thyrocytes from a bitransgenic murine model (Bi-Tg) of thyroid-specific PBF and PTTG overexpression. Irradiation exposure to amplify p53 levels further induced significant repression of DDR genes in Bi-Tg thyrocytes (P=2.4 × 10−4) compared with either PBF- (P=1.5 × 10−3) or PTTG-expressing thyrocytes (P=NS). Consistent with this, genetic instability was greatest in Bi-Tg thyrocytes with a mean genetic instability (GI) index of 35.8±2.6%, as well as significant induction of gross chromosomal aberrations in thyroidal TPC-1 cells following overexpression of PBF and PTTG. We extended our findings to human thyroid cancer using TCGA data sets (n=322) and found striking correlations with PBF and PTTG expression in well-characterised DDR gene panel RNA-seq data. In addition, genetic associations and transient transfection identified PBF as a downstream target of the receptor tyrosine kinase-BRAF signalling pathway, emphasising a role for PBF as a novel component in a pathway well described to drive neoplastic growth. We also showed that overall survival (P=1.91 × 10−5) and disease-free survival (P=4.9 × 10−5) was poorer for TCGA patients with elevated tumoural PBF/PTTG expression and mutationally activated BRAF. Together our findings indicate that PBF and PTTG have a critical role in promoting thyroid cancer that is predictive of poorer patient outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2615787203,"Enzymes are highly specific biocatalysts, yet they can promote unwanted side reactions. Here we investigated the factors that direct catalysis in the enoyl-thioester reductase Etr1p. We show that a single conserved threonine is essential to suppress the formation of a side product that would otherwise act as a high-affinity inhibitor of the enzyme. Substitution of this threonine with isosteric valine increases side-product formation by more than six orders of magnitude, while decreasing turnover frequency by only one order of magnitude. Our results show that the promotion of wanted reactions and the suppression of unwanted side reactions operate independently at the active site of Etr1p, and that the active suppression of side reactions is highly conserved in the family of medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (MDRs). Our discovery emphasizes the fact that the active destabilization of competing transition states is an important factor during catalysis that has implications for the understanding and the de novo design of enzymes."

Cellular Automaton (CA) is a uniform array of finite-state machines that update their states in discrete time depending on states of their closest neighbors by the same rule. Arrays of MFCs could, in principle, act as massive-parallel computing devices with local connectivity between elementary processors. We provide a theoretical design of such a parallel processor by implementing CA in MFCs. We have chosen Conway’s Game of Life as the ‘benchmark’ CA because this is the most popular CA which also exhibits an enormously rich spectrum of patterns. Each cell of the Game of Life CA is realized using two MFCs. The MFCs are linked electrically and hydraulically. The model is verified via simulation of an electrical circuit demonstrating equivalent behaviours. The design is a first step towards future implementations of fully autonomous biological computing devices with massive parallelism. The energy independence of such devices counteracts their somewhat slow transitions—compared to silicon circuitry—between the different states during computation."

A retrospective analysis on Pj pneumonia (PjP) cases occurring in Tor Vergata University Hospital, Italy, during the period 2011-2015. The patients' demographic, clinical and radiological characteristics and the Pj genotypes were considered. The study population included 116 patients, 37.9% of whom had haematological malignancy or underwent haematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 22.4% had HIV infection, 16.4% had chronic lung diseases (CLD), 7.8% had a solid cancer, and 3.4% underwent a solid organ transplant (SOT). The remaining 12.1% had a miscellaneous other condition. At univariate analysis, being older than 60 years was significantly correlated with a severe PjP (OR [95%CI] 2.52 [0.10-5.76]; p = 0.031) and death (OR [95%CI] 2.44 [1.05-5.70]; p = 0.036), while a previous trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis were significantly associated with a less severe pneumonia (OR[95%CI] 0.35 [0.15-0.84], p = 0.023); moreover, death due to PjP was significantly more frequent in patients with CLD (OR[95%CI] 3.26 [1.17-9.05]; p = 0.019) while, admission to the Infectious Diseases Unit was significantly associated with fewer deaths (OR[95%CI] 0.10 [0.03-0.36], p = 0.002).

https://openalex.org/W2613975862,"Exposure to metals and other trace elements negatively affects infection dynamics of monogeneans, including diplozoids, but, physiological mechanisms linked to exposure have yet to be documented. In this study sequestration of trace elements and reactive oxygen intermediate production in the monogenean, Paradiplozoon ichthyoxanthon, was demonstrated. During dissection of host fish, Labeobarbus aeneus, the gills were excised and assessed for P. ichthyoxanthon, which were removed and frozen for fluorescence microscopy or fixed for transmission electron microscopy. Trace elements were sequestered in the vitellaria and sclerites in P. ichthyoxanthon, and the presence of reactive oxygen intermediates was observed predominantly in the tegument of the parasite. Trace elements and metals identified and ranked according to weight percentages (wt%) in the vitellaria were Cu > C > Au > O > Cr > Fe > Si while for the sclerites C > Cu > O > Au > Fe > Cr > Si were identified. For most element detected, readings were higher in the vitellaria than the sclerites, except for C and O which were higher in sclerites. Specifically for metals, all levels detected in the vitellaria were greater than in sclerites. Based on the proportion of trace elements present in the vitellaria and sclerites it appears that most trace elements including metals were sequestered in the vitellaria. The results of reactive oxygen intermediate production in the tegument of the parasite suggests either trace element accumulation takes place across the tegument or results from the action of the host's immune response on the parasite. The results serve as the first demonstration of trace element sequestration and reactive oxygen intermediates in a freshwater monogenean parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2612020007,"End of life (EOL) care is associated with greater costs, particularly for acute care services. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), EOL costs may be accentuated due to reliance on hospital-based services and expensive diagnostic tests and treatments. We aimed to compare EOL health care use and costs between IBD and non-IBD decedents.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all decedents of Ontario, Canada between 2010 and 2013 using linked health administrative data. IBD (N = 2,214) and non-IBD (N = 262,540) decedents were compared on total direct health care costs in the last year of life and hospitalization time during the last 90 days of life.During the last 90 days of life, IBD patients spent an average of 16 days in hospital, equal to 2.1 greater adjusted hospital days (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-2.8 days) than non-IBD patients. IBD diagnosis was associated with $7,210 CAD (95% CI $5,005 - $9,464) higher adjusted per-patient cost in the last year of life, of which 76% was due to excess hospitalization costs. EOL cost of IBD care was higher than 15 of 16 studied chronic conditions. Health care costs rose sharply in the last 90 days of life, primarily due to escalating hospitalization costs.IBD patients spend more time in hospital and incur substantially greater health care costs than other decedents as they approach the EOL. These excess costs could be curtailed through avoidance of unnecessary hospitalizations and expensive treatments in the setting of irreversible deterioration."

The aim of our analysis was to evaluate the effects of manual therapy delivered by general practitioners and ambulatory orthopedic surgeons in routine care on follow up consultations, sick leave, health service utilization and costs for acute LBP compared to matched patients not receiving manual therapy. This is a propensity score matched cohort study based on health claims data. We identified a total of 113.652 adult patients with acute LBP and no coded red flags of whom 21.021 (18%) received SMT by physicians. In the final analysis 17.965 patients in each group could be matched. Balance on patients’ coded characteristics, comorbidity and prior health service utilization was achieved. The provision of SMT for acute LBP had no relevant impact on follow up visits and days of sick leave for LBP in the index billing period and the following year. SMT was associated with a higher proportion of imaging studies for LBP (30.6% vs. 23%, SMD: 0.164 [95% CI 0.143–0.185]). SMT did not lead to meaningful savings by replacing other health services for LBP. SMT for acute non-specific LBP in routine care was not clinically meaningful effective to reduce sick leave and reconsultation rates compared to no SMT and did not lead to meaningful savings by replacing other health services from the perspective of health insurance. This does not imply that SMT is ineffective but might reflect a problem with selection of suitable patients and the quality and quantity of SMT in routine care. National Manual Medicine societies should state clearly that imaging is not routinely needed prior to SMT in patients with low suspicion of presence of red flags and monitor the quality of provided services."
https://openalex.org/W2612071885,"Traditional measurement models of health care utilization are not able to represent the complex structure of health care utilization. In this qualitative study, we, therefore, developed a new model to represent the health care utilization structure. In Norway and Germany, we conducted episodic interviews, participant observation and a concurrent context analysis. Data was analyzed by thematic coding in the framework of grounded theory. Consultations do very often not only have one single reason for encounter. They are usually not independent events but form part of consultation sequences. We could find structural differences between Norway and Germany regarding the flow of information between consultations and which providers are involved in health care in what way. This leads to a sequential model, in which health care utilization is seen as sequences of consultations. Such health care utilization sequences consist of nodes which are connected by edges. Nodes represent patient-provider contacts and edges depict the flow of information. Time and the level of health care providers are dimensions in the model. These sequences can be described by different measures and aggregated on population level. Thus, the sequential model can be further used in analyzing health care utilization quantitatively, e.g., by using routine data."

The two reproductive modes (strains) of the parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens share the same geographical areas but live in contrasting habitats: arrhenotokous wasps live in the wild (generally orchards), whereas thelytokous ones live mostly in stored-products buildings (e.g. granaries). This species thus represents a relevant biological model for understanding the relationship between the ecological constraints faced by a species and its memory and learning ability. We showed that after having laid eggs in presence of both a synthetic odour and natural olfactory cues of their host, arrhenotokous wasps exhibited a change in their behavioural response towards the synthetic odour that was at least as pronounced as in thelytokous ones even though they were faster in their decision-making process. This is consistent with better learning skills in arrhenotokous wasps. The corresponding memory trace persisted in both strains for at least 51 h. We compare and discuss the learning and memory ablities of both strains as a function of their costs and benefits in their preferential habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2616557843,"Previous studies have shown that children of alcohol use disorder (AUD) parents are more likely to develop alcohol problems as well as antisocial and other behavior problems. The purpose of this study was to examine gender discordance in the effect of early maternal and paternal influences on antisocial behaviors of boys and girls, as well as the environmental factors that moderate the parental effects. Specifically, we examined the effects of childhood and adulthood antisocial behavior of the parents on offspring antisocial behavior as young adults. We also examined whether mothers' and fathers' drinking problems when offspring were young children (6-8 years) affected offspring antisocial behavior as young adults (18-21 years). We evaluated 655 children from 339 families in the Michigan Longitudinal Study (MLS), a prospective study of AUD and non-AUD families. Path models were constructed in order to test for the parental contributions to offspring outcomes. We found that both mothers' and fathers' antisocial behavior contributed to the children's young adult antisocial behavior. Only mothers' drinking problems while their children were little had a significant effect on their sons' later drinking, but not on their daughters'. These different parental effects suggest that maternal and paternal influences may be mediated by different mechanisms."
