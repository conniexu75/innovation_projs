https://openalex.org/W2949996247,"Microglia are increasingly recognized for their major contributions during brain development and neurodegenerative disease. It is currently unknown whether these functions are carried out by subsets of microglia during different stages of development and adulthood or within specific brain regions. Here, we performed deep single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of microglia and related myeloid cells sorted from various regions of embryonic, early postnatal, and adult mouse brains. We found that the majority of adult microglia expressing homeostatic genes are remarkably similar in transcriptomes, regardless of brain region. By contrast, early postnatal microglia are more heterogeneous. We discovered a proliferative-region-associated microglia (PAM) subset, mainly found in developing white matter, that shares a characteristic gene signature with degenerative disease-associated microglia (DAM). Such PAM have amoeboid morphology, are metabolically active, and phagocytose newly formed oligodendrocytes. This scRNA-seq atlas will be a valuable resource for dissecting innate immune functions in health and disease."

Photorespiration deals with these by-products, converting them into metabolically useful components, but at the cost of energy lost. South et al. constructed a metabolic pathway in transgenic tobacco plants that more efficiently recaptures the unproductive by-products of photosynthesis with less energy lost (see the Perspective by Eisenhut and Weber). In field trials, these transgenic tobacco plants were ∼40% more productive than wild-type tobacco plants. Science , this issue p. eaat9077 ; see also p. 32"
https://openalex.org/W2907992023,"Existing high-throughput methods to identify RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are based on capture of polyadenylated RNAs and cannot recover proteins that interact with nonadenylated RNAs, including long noncoding RNA, pre-mRNAs and bacterial RNAs. We present orthogonal organic phase separation (OOPS), which does not require molecular tagging or capture of polyadenylated RNA, and apply it to recover cross-linked protein-RNA and free protein, or protein-bound RNA and free RNA, in an unbiased way. We validated OOPS in HEK293, U2OS and MCF10A human cell lines, and show that 96% of proteins recovered were bound to RNA. We show that all long RNAs can be cross-linked to proteins, and recovered 1,838 RBPs, including 926 putative novel RBPs. OOPS is approximately 100-fold more efficient than existing methods and can enable analyses of dynamic RNA-protein interactions. We also characterize dynamic changes in RNA-protein interactions in mammalian cells following nocodazole arrest, and present a bacterial RNA-interactome for Escherichia coli. OOPS is compatible with downstream proteomics and RNA sequencing, and can be applied in any organism."
https://openalex.org/W2907712446,"The 2018 Nigerian Lassa fever season saw the largest ever recorded upsurge of cases, raising concerns over the emergence of a strain with increased transmission rate. To understand the molecular epidemiology of this upsurge, we performed, for the first time at the epicenter of an unfolding outbreak, metagenomic nanopore sequencing directly from patient samples, an approach dictated by the highly variable genome of the target pathogen. Genomic data and phylogenetic reconstructions were communicated immediately to Nigerian authorities and the World Health Organization to inform the public health response. Real-time analysis of 36 genomes and subsequent confirmation using all 120 samples sequenced in the country of origin revealed extensive diversity and phylogenetic intermingling with strains from previous years, suggesting independent zoonotic transmission events and thus allaying concerns of an emergent strain or extensive human-to-human transmission."

Stickleback fish represent a classic example of this, in which repeated colonizations of freshwater have resulted in the loss of pelvic hind fins. Previous work has shown that a pelvic enhancer gene is involved. Xie et al. now show that this gene lies within a region of the genome that is prone to double-stranded DNA breakage owing to a high thymine-guanine content. This enhanced region of breakage could lead to enhanced mutation rates that facilitate repeated adaptations to new environments. Science , this issue p. 81"
https://openalex.org/W2907110015,"Reversing chromatin dynamics for development Compacted chromatin regions, marked by trimethylation of histone H3 at position lysine 9 (H3K9me3), occur at highly repeated DNA sequences, helping to suppress recombination and gene expression. Because pluripotent cells contain low levels of H3K9me3 heterochromatin relative to differentiated cells, it has been thought that an increase in such heterochromatin helps to define cell differentiation. Nicetto et al. used two independent methods to examine compacted heterochromatic domains and found that H3K9me3 compaction increased at protein-coding genes during early mouse organogenesis. During differentiation, these domains open up to allow cell-specific expression. Loss of heterochromatin by genetic inactivation of the H3K9me3 methyltransferases caused ectopic expression of cell-inappropriate genes and tissue pathology. Science , this issue p. 294"

The parallel collicular pathway is believed to sparsely project throughout the visual cortex and have a modulatory role on cortical responses to visual stimuli. Beltramo and Scanziani found a visual cortical area that is entirely dedicated to the superior colliculus. This area can discriminate moving visual stimuli that the “classical” primary visual cortex cannot. Thus, the superior colliculus, a phylogenetically ancient structure, has its own projection in neocortex that provides this area with exquisite feature-detection abilities not found in the classical primary visual cortex.

Kolmer et al. show that fluorinated aryl groups can be coupled to form nanographenes on the rutile surface of titanium oxide. The fluorine substitution of the aryl groups was selected so that as the carbon-fluorine bonds were thermally activated, a stepwise process sequentially added aromatic rings around a central aryl group until it was completely substituted.

https://openalex.org/W2906697862,"The unique physical properties of buckminsterfullerene, C60, have attracted intense research activity since its original discovery. Total quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of isolated C60 molecules has been of particularly long-standing interest. Such observations have, to date, been unsuccessful owing to the difficulty in preparing cold, gas-phase C60 in sufficiently high densities. Here we report high-resolution infrared absorption spectroscopy of C60 in the 8.5-micron spectral region (1180 to 1190 wave number). A combination of cryogenic buffer-gas cooling and cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy has enabled the observation of quantum state-resolved rovibrational transitions. Characteristic nuclear spin statistical intensity patterns confirm the indistinguishability of the 60 carbon-12 atoms, while rovibrational fine structure encodes further details of the molecule's rare icosahedral symmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2907055014,"Machine learning (ML) algorithms provide effective ways to build prediction models using longitudinal information given their capacity to incorporate numerous predictor variables without compromising the accuracy of the risk prediction. Clinical risk prediction models in chronic hepatitis C virus (CHC) can be challenging due to non-linear nature of disease progression. We developed and compared two ML algorithms to predict cirrhosis development in a large CHC-infected cohort using longitudinal data.We used national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data to identify CHC patients in care between 2000-2016. The primary outcome was cirrhosis development ascertained by two consecutive aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio indexes (APRIs) > 2 after time zero given the infrequency of liver biopsy in clinical practice and that APRI is a validated non-invasive biomarker of fibrosis in CHC. We excluded those with initial APRI > 2 or pre-existing diagnosis of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatic decompensation. Enrollment was defined as the date of the first APRI. Time zero was defined as 2 years after enrollment. Cross-sectional (CS) models used predictors at or closest before time zero as a comparison. Longitudinal models used CS predictors plus longitudinal summary variables (maximum, minimum, maximum of slope, minimum of slope and total variation) between enrollment and time zero. Covariates included demographics, labs, and body mass index. Model performance was evaluated using concordance and area under the receiver operating curve (AuROC). A total of 72,683 individuals with CHC were analyzed with the cohort having a mean age of 52.8, 96.8% male and 53% white. There are 11,616 individuals (16%) who met the primary outcome over a mean follow-up of 7 years. We found superior predictive performance for the longitudinal Cox model compared to the CS Cox model (concordance 0.764 vs 0.746), and for the longitudinal boosted-survival-tree model compared to the linear Cox model (concordance 0.774 vs 0.764). The accuracy of the longitudinal models at 1,3,5 years after time zero also showed superior performance compared to the CS model, based on AuROC.Boosted-survival-tree based models using longitudinal information are statistically superior to cross-sectional or linear models for predicting development of cirrhosis in CHC, though all four models were highly accurate. Similar statistical methods could be applied to predict outcomes in other non-linear chronic disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2908291032,"Proxy records show that before the onset of modern anthropogenic warming, globally coherent cooling occurred from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. The long memory of the ocean suggests that these historical surface anomalies are associated with ongoing deep-ocean temperature adjustments. Combining an ocean model with modern and paleoceanographic data leads to a prediction that the deep Pacific is still adjusting to the cooling going into the Little Ice Age, whereas temperature trends in the surface ocean and deep Atlantic reflect modern warming. This prediction is corroborated by temperature changes identified between the HMS Challenger expedition of the 1870s and modern hydrography. The implied heat loss in the deep ocean since 1750 CE offsets one-fourth of the global heat gain in the upper ocean."

However, how these distinct substructures are formed, whether they are assembled by different scaffolds, and whether different RNA granule scaffolds induce these different substructures remains unknown. Here, using fluorescence microscopy–based morphological and molecular-dynamics analyses, we demonstrate that RNA granule scaffold proteins (scaffolds) can be largely classified into two groups, liquid and solid types, which induce the formation of liquid-like and solid-like granules, respectively, when expressed separately in cultured cells. We found that when co-expressed, the liquid-type and solid-type scaffolds combine and form liquid- and solid-like substructures in the same granules, respectively. The combination of the different types of scaffolds reduced the immobile fractions of the solid-type scaffolds and their dose-dependent ability to decrease nascent polypeptides in granules, but had little effect on the dynamics of the liquid-type scaffolds or their dose-dependent ability to increase nascent polypeptides in granules. These results suggest that solid- and liquid-type scaffolds form different substructures in RNA granules and differentially affect each other.

Describing plasmas theoretically is tricky when they are in the strongly coupled regime; reaching that regime in the laboratory would provide a valuable benchmark for theory. To that end, Langin et al. worked with a cold plasma created out of atoms of strontium that were ionized by laser light (see the Perspective by Bergeson). They used lasers to cool the ions down to about 50 millikelvin, reaching the desired strongly coupled regime. Science , this issue p. 61 ; see also p. 33"
https://openalex.org/W2907477221,"Background Obesity among children is an alarming issue due to an increased incidence over the last years with devastating physiological and psychological consequences. Current available medical diagnostic tools use invasive methods to evaluate and monitor the lipid profile, glycaemia or liver status for determining the overweight/ obesity complications. The standard methods proposed for the assay of IL6 and leptin from saliva cannot detect these two biomarkers in children saliva; the levels of IL6 and leptin in children’s saliva are lower than the limit of determination of the standard methods. Therefore, we proposed a method based on utilization of stochastic sensors, able to simultaneously perform a qualitative and quantitative determination of these two biomarkers within minutes, in the range able to cover healthy and obese children. Methods Children from the urban area monitored for annual standard analyses and health status assessment at National Institute of Endocrinology C.I. Parhon within University of Medicine and Pharmacy “Carol Davila”, Bucharest, Romania were included in the study. In the same day, for all participants of the study, blood analyses were performed and saliva samples were collected for the determination of the IL-6 and leptin levels. Findings/ Results The children diagnosed with overweight/ obesity presented not significantly different blood lipid profile and glycaemia comparing to the control group. Only few cases of the children presented high levels of cholesterol, low level of HDL-cholesterol, a slightly increased level of triglycerides and transaminases. No correlation with the body mass index could be established with the blood analyses results. In case of the overweight/obese children, the salivary level of the proinflammatory citokynes IL-6 (41ng/mL±21) and leptin (40.4ng/mL±28.8), were significantly increased comparing to normal weight children (IL-6 8.1±4.6, leptin 9.58±3.1). Moreover, the saliva level of the IL-6 was positively correlated with the body mass index. Salivary leptin level was highly variable in case of obese children, 6 patients presenting similar levels with the control group. Conclusions Increased levels of salivary IL-6 and leptin sustain a systemic inflammation status despite normal range of standard blood analyses. The results were positively correlated in case of IL-6 with the body mass index the general accepted method used for the assessment of the obesity or overweight degree The determination of these markers in saliva samples by a stochastic method proved the utility within the medical examination for a better evaluation of the health status in obesity. The method has some advantages like: easy collection of the biological sample, fast determination of low concentrations and could be promising in case of no associated oral cavity infections or inflammations which could interfere the results."

https://openalex.org/W2907783376,"Objective To identify nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver stiffness in Mexican subjects with different body mass index (BMI). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 505 adults. Risk for NASH was defined as the presence of one or more of the following biochemical and metabolic parameters (BMPs): fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dl, triglycerides (TG) ≥150 mg/dl, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) ≥2.5, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >54 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >42 IU/L. Body mass index measurement and nutritional assessment were performed by standard procedures. Liver fibrosis stage was determined by liver stiffness measurement using transitional elastography (TE) or by liver biopsy (LB). Results Risk for NASH was 57% (290/505). Most BMPs values incremented by BMI category. Among 171 at-risk patients, 106 subjects were evaluated by TE and 65 subjects by LB. Abnormal liver stiffness (≥6.0 kPa) was prevalent in 54% (57/106) of the cases, whereas by LB, 91% (59/65) of patients with obesity had NASH and liver fibrosis. Furthermore, liver fibrosis was prevalent in 46% (6/13) in normal weight individuals, whereas 4.6% (3/65) of patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 showed no histopathological abnormalities. Overall, 67.8% (116/171) of the patients had abnormal liver stiffness or NASH. The normal weight patients with liver damage consumed relatively a higher fat-rich diet compared to the other groups whereas the remaining subgroups shared a similar dietary pattern. Conclusion Young patients with overweight and obesity showed a high prevalence of altered BMPs related to abnormal liver stiffness assessed by TE and NASH by LB. Early diagnostic strategies are required to detect the risk for NASH and avoid further liver damage in populations with a rising prevalence of obesity by defining the risk factors involved in the onset and progression of NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2907621416,"Lipidomic techniques can improve our understanding of complex lipid interactions that regulate metabolic diseases. Here, a serum phospholipidomics analysis identified associations between phosphatidylglycerols (PGs) and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Compared with the other phospholipids, serum PGs were the most elevated in patients with low microbiota gene richness, which were normalized after a dietary intervention that restored gut microbial diversity. Serum PG levels were positively correlated with metagenomic functional capacities for bacterial LPS synthesis and host markers of low-grade inflammation; transcriptome databases identified PG synthase, the first committed enzyme in PG synthesis, as a potential mediator. Experiments in mice and cultured human-derived macrophages demonstrated that LPS induces PG release. Acute PG treatment in mice altered adipose tissue gene expression toward remodeling and inhibited ex vivo lipolysis in adipose tissue, suggesting that PGs favor lipid storage. Indeed, several PG species were associated with the severity of obesity in mice and humans. Finally, despite enrichment in PGs in bacterial membranes, experiments employing gnotobiotic mice colonized with recombinant PG overproducing Lactococcus lactis showed limited direct contribution of microbial PGs to the host. In summary, PGs are inflammation-responsive lipids indirectly regulated by the gut microbiota via endotoxins and regulate adipose tissue homeostasis in obesity.-Kayser, B.

G., Oakley, F., Langella, P., Clément, K., Dugail, I. Phosphatidylglycerols are induced by gut dysbiosis and inflammation, and favorably modulate adipose tissue remodeling in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2907688616,"The Global Gender Gap Index is one of the best-known measures of national gender inequality, used by both academics and policy makers. We argue that that this measure has a number of problems and introduce a simpler measure of national levels of gender inequality. Our proposed measure is based on sex differences in the opportunity to lead a long healthy and satisfied life that is grounded on educational opportunities. The measure better captures variation in gender inequality than other measures, with inclusion of outcomes that can be favorable or unfavorable to either sex, not simply unfavorable to women. We focus on some of the most basic measures available for 134 countries from 2012-2016 (i.e., disadvantages in children's basic education, life satisfaction, and healthy life span) and we relate these to various measures, including the United Nations' Human Development Index. We found that low levels of human development are typically associated with disadvantages for girls and women, while medium and high levels of development are typically associated with disadvantages for boys and men. Countries with the highest levels of human development are closest to gender parity, albeit typically with a slight advantage for women. We argue that the disparities, when they are found, are related to the sexual division of labor (i.e., traditional gender roles) in poorly developed countries as well as the underinvestment in preventative health care in more developed nations."

https://openalex.org/W2952791358,"Bone remodeling involves the coordinated actions of osteoclasts, which resorb the calcified bony matrix, and osteoblasts, which refill erosion pits created by osteoclasts to restore skeletal integrity and adapt to changes in mechanical load. Osteoblasts are derived from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cell precursors, which undergo differentiation under the influence of a host of local and environmental cues. To characterize the autocrine/paracrine signaling networks associated with osteoblast maturation and function, we performed gene network analysis using complementary “agnostic” DNA microarray and “targeted” NanoString nCounter datasets derived from murine MC3T3-E1 cells induced to undergo synchronized osteoblastic differentiation in vitro. Pairwise datasets representing changes in gene expression associated with growth arrest (day 2 to 5 in culture), differentiation (day 5 to 10 in culture), and osteoblast maturation (day 10 to 28 in culture) were analyzed using Ingenuity Systems Pathways Analysis to generate predictions about signaling pathway activity based on the temporal sequence of changes in target gene expression. Our data indicate that some pathways involved in osteoblast differentiation, e.g. Wnt/β-catenin signaling, are most active early in the process, while others, e.g. TGFβ/BMP, cytokine/JAK-STAT and TNFα/RANKL signaling, increase in activity as differentiation progresses. Collectively, these pathways contribute to the sequential expression of genes involved in the synthesis and mineralization of extracellular matrix. These results provide insight into the temporal coordination and complex interplay between signaling networks controlling gene expression during osteoblast differentiation. A more complete understanding of these processes may aid the discovery of novel methods to promote osteoblast development for the treatment of conditions characterized by low bone mineral density."
https://openalex.org/W2907239680,"Altered reward processing is a transdiagnostic factor implicated in a wide range of psychiatric disorders. While prior animal and adult research has shown that stress contributes to reward dysfunction, less is known about how stress impacts reward processing in youth. Towards addressing this gap, the present study probed neural activation associated with reward processing following an acute stressor. Healthy adolescents (n = 40) completed a clinical assessment, and fMRI data were acquired while participants completed a monetary guessing task under a no-stress condition and then under a stress condition. Based on prior literature, analyses focused on a priori defined regions-of-interest, specifically the striatum (win trials) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC] and insula (loss trials). Two main findings emerged. First, reward-related neural activation (i.e., striatum) was blunted in the stress relative to the no-stress condition. Second, the stress condition also contributed to blunted neural response following reward in loss-related regions (i.e., dACC, anterior insula); however, there were no changes in loss sensitivity. These results highlight the importance of conceptualizing neural vulnerability within the presence of stress, as this may clarify risk for mental disorders during a critical period of development."
https://openalex.org/W2950171690,"Safety pharmacology screening against a wide range of unintended vital targets using in vitro assays is crucial to understand off-target interactions with drug candidates. With the increasing demand for in vitro assays, ligand- and structure-based virtual screening approaches have been evaluated for potential utilization in safety profiling. Although ligand based approaches have been actively applied in retrospective analysis or prospectively within well-defined chemical space during the early discovery stage (i.e., HTS screening and lead optimization), virtual screening is rarely implemented in later stage of drug discovery (i.e., safety). Here we present a case study to evaluate ligand-based 3D QSAR models built based on in vitro antagonistic activity data against adenosine receptor 2A (A2A). The resulting models, obtained from 268 chemically diverse compounds, were used to test a set of 1,897 chemically distinct drugs, simulating the real-world challenge of safety screening when presented with novel chemistry and a limited training set. Due to the unique requirements of safety screening versus discovery screening, the limitations of 3D QSAR methods (i.e., chemotypes, dependence on large training set, and prone to false positives) are less critical than early discovery screen. We demonstrated that 3D QSAR modeling can be effectively applied in safety assessment prior to in vitro assays, even with chemotypes that are drastically different from training compounds. It is also worth noting that our model is able to adequately make the mechanistic distinction between agonists and antagonists, which is important to inform subsequent in vivo studies. Overall, we present an in-depth analysis of the appropriate utilization and interpretation of pharmacophore-based 3D QSAR models for safety screening."
https://openalex.org/W2908223959,"The increasing use of personal listening devices (PLDs) has been accompanied by a rise in the prevalence of hearing loss (HL) in younger age groups. However, there have been few reports on the relationship between HL and leisure noise exposure (LNE) in adolescents. The purpose of our study was to investigate the prevalence of HL in students attending general middle and high schools and to identify factors affecting HL prevalence. A total of 2,879 nationally representative adolescents in the first years of middle and high school underwent audiometric testing and otological examinations, and completed questionnaires, from June to December 2016. A speech-frequency hearing loss (SFHL) was considered present when the pure tone averages (PTAs) at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz were ≥ 15 dB and a high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL) was considered present when the PTAs at 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz were ≥ 15 dB. About 17% of Korean adolescents exhibited at least slight HL. The prevalence rates of SFHL and HFHL in the poorer ear were 11.6% and 10.3%, respectively, among Korean adolescents. The use of local area network (LAN) gaming centers and an experience of being asked by others to lower earphone volume were associated with both SFHL and HFHL. It is important to avoid excessive LNE to prevent adolescent HL. Additionally, SFHL or HFHL in the poorer ear was associated with lower academic performance."
https://openalex.org/W2950289963,"Sexual and physical abuse in childhood creates a great health burden including on mental and reproductive health. A possible link between child abuse and HIV infection has increasingly attracted attention. This paper investigated whether a history of child physical and sexual abuse is associated with HIV infection among adult women.A cross sectional survey was conducted among 2042 postnatal women (mean age = 26y) attending six public primary health care clinics in Harare, Zimbabwe within 6 weeks post-delivery. Clinic records were reviewed for mother's antenatal HIV status. Participants were interviewed about childhood abuse including physical or sexual abuse before 15 years of age, forced first sex before 16, HIV risk factors such as age difference at first sex before age 16. Multivariate analyses assessed the associations between mother's HIV status and child physical and sexual abuse while controlling for confounding variables.More than one in four (26.6%) reported abuse before the age of 15: 14.6% physical abuse and 9.1% sexual abuse,14.3% reported forced first sex and 9.0% first sex before 16 with someone 5+ years older. Fifteen percent of women tested HIV positive during the recent antenatal care visit. In multivariate analysis, childhood physical abuse (aOR 3.30 95%CI 1.58-6.90), sexual abuse (3.18 95%CI: 1.64-6.19), forced first sex (aOR 1.42, 95%CI: 1.00-2.02), and 5+ years age difference with first sex partner (aOR 1.66 95%CI 1.09-2.53) were independently associated with HIV infection.This study highlights that child physical and/or sexual abuse may increase risk for HIV acquisition. Further research is needed to assess the pathways to HIV acquisition from childhood to adulthood. Prevention of child abuse must form part of the HIV prevention agenda in Sub-Saharan Africa."

Transgenic plants generated by employing such methods offer the prospect of low-cost sustainable pest management; in this regard, we used chloroplast targeting and cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway enhancement in this study to investigate the interaction of santalenes and bergamotene with insects. The santalene- and bergamotene-emitting transgenic tobacco plants thus generated were utilized to study host preference in the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae (Sulzer)). The results showed that co-expression of either 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) or truncated HMGR with santalene synthase led to the production of higher amounts of santalenes and bergamotene in transgenic tobacco plants, and that these santalene- and bergamotene-emitting plants were attractive to green peach aphids. We accordingly propose that such transgenic plants may have potential application in pest management as a trap crop to prevent green peach aphid infestation of wild-type tobacco plants."
https://openalex.org/W2907542103,"The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (or citric acid cycle) is responsible for the complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA and formation of intermediates required for ATP production and other anabolic pathways, such as amino acid synthesis. Here, we uncovered an additional mechanism that may help explain the essential role of the TCA cycle in the early embryogenesis of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that knockdown of citrate synthase (cts-1), the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the TCA cycle, results in early embryonic arrest, but that this phenotype is not because of ATP and amino acid depletions. As a possible alternative mechanism explaining this developmental deficiency, we observed that cts-1 RNAi embryos had elevated levels of intracellular acetyl-CoA, the starting metabolite of the TCA cycle. Of note, we further discovered that these embryos exhibit hyperacetylation of mitochondrial proteins. We found that supplementation with acetylase-inhibiting polyamines, including spermidine and putrescine, counteracted the protein hyperacetylation and developmental arrest in the cts-1 RNAi embryos. Contrary to the hypothesis that spermidine acts as an acetyl sink for elevated acetyl-CoA, the levels of three forms of acetylspermidine, N1-acetylspermidine, N8-acetylspermidine, and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine, were not significantly increased in embryos treated with exogenous spermidine. Instead, we demonstrated that the mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 4 (encoded by the sir-2.2 gene) is required for spermidine's suppression of protein hyperacetylation and developmental arrest in the cts-1 RNAi embryos. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that during early embryogenesis, acetyl-CoA consumption by the TCA cycle in C. elegans prevents protein hyperacetylation and thereby protects mitochondrial function. The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (or citric acid cycle) is responsible for the complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA and formation of intermediates required for ATP production and other anabolic pathways, such as amino acid synthesis. Here, we uncovered an additional mechanism that may help explain the essential role of the TCA cycle in the early embryogenesis of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that knockdown of citrate synthase (cts-1), the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the TCA cycle, results in early embryonic arrest, but that this phenotype is not because of ATP and amino acid depletions. As a possible alternative mechanism explaining this developmental deficiency, we observed that cts-1 RNAi embryos had elevated levels of intracellular acetyl-CoA, the starting metabolite of the TCA cycle. Of note, we further discovered that these embryos exhibit hyperacetylation of mitochondrial proteins. We found that supplementation with acetylase-inhibiting polyamines, including spermidine and putrescine, counteracted the protein hyperacetylation and developmental arrest in the cts-1 RNAi embryos. Contrary to the hypothesis that spermidine acts as an acetyl sink for elevated acetyl-CoA, the levels of three forms of acetylspermidine, N1-acetylspermidine, N8-acetylspermidine, and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine, were not significantly increased in embryos treated with exogenous spermidine.

Several studies have elucidated that the TCA cycle inhibitor fluoroacetate blocks the development of 1-cell or 2-cell embryos in rabbits and mice (1Kane M.T. Buckley N.J.

Moreover, down-regulation of genes for the TCA cycle components has been shown to hamper early embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans (3Rahman M.M. Rosu S. Joseph-Strauss D. Cohen-Fix O.

Thus, although the TCA cycle is essential for early embryonic development, its molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. tricarboxylic acid capillary electrophoresis isolation buffer total lysate mitochondrial pellet post-mitochondrial supernatant spermidine. The starting point for the TCA cycle is acetyl-CoA that reacts with oxaloacetate to form citrate, which is then oxidized to CO2 for ATP production in the cycle. In addition, acetyl-CoA is used for the acetylation reaction as a donor of the acetyl group that is transferred to α-amino groups of N-terminal amino acids or the ε-amino group of lysine residues of proteins as well as amino groups of metabolites, such as polyamines (5Pegg A.E. Spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase: A key metabolic regulator.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Reversible protein acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. In the nucleus, reversible acetylation of histones and transcription factors through acetyltransferases and deacetylases plays central roles in the regulation of gene expression (6Verdin E. Ott M. 50 years of protein acetylation: From gene regulation to epigenetics, metabolism and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16 (25549891): 258-26410.1038/nrm3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Likewise, mitochondria have been shown to harbor numerous acetylated proteins; namely 63% of mitochondrial proteins contain lysine acetylation sites (7Lundby A. Lage K. Weinert B.T. Bekker-Jensen D.B. Secher A. Skovgaard T. Kelstrup C.D. Dmytriyev A. Choudhary C. Lundby C. Olsen J.V.

However, unlike the nucleus, mitochondrial acetylation is thought to be largely elicited by nonenzymatic reaction of reactive lysine residues with acetyl-CoA and removed by the mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacylase SIRT3 (8Anderson K.A.

It should be noted that protein acetylation in mitochondria typically results in dysfunction of various major aspects of mitochondrial biology. It was previously reported that acetyl-CoA levels were elevated and proteins were acetylated in mitochondria when fuel was increased (12Ghanta S. Grossmann R.E. Brenner C. Mitochondrial protein acetylation as a cell-intrinsic, evolutionary driver of fat storage: Chemical and metabolic logic of acetyl-lysine modifications.CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2013; 48 (24050258): 561-57410.3109/10409238.2013.838204Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, current evidence suggests that acetyl-CoA is a key factor determining the levels of protein acetylation during early embryonic development in Xenopus laevis (13Tsuchiya Y. Pham U. Hu W. Ohnuma S. Gout I. Changes in acetyl CoA levels during the early embryonic development of Xenopus laevis.PloS One. 2014; 9 (24831956)e97693 10.1371/journal.pone.0097693Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Given that elevated acetyl-CoA levels could induce protein lysine acetylation in mitochondria, we hypothesized that the consumption of acetyl-CoA through the TCA cycle is an indispensable process for maintaining normal mitochondrial function. Here we provide a functional relationship between the TCA cycle and mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation during early embryonic development in C. elegans. To understand the role of the TCA cycle during embryogenesis, we first measured the levels of metabolites of the TCA cycle at both the early and late embryonic stages in C. elegans. LC-MS analysis showed that the relative ratio of citrate, but not other metabolites of the TCA cycle, is significantly decreased in the late embryos (Fig. 1A). Given that citrate is consumed and then regenerated by the sequence of reactions to complete the TCA cycle, the reduction of citrate at the late embryonic stage implies a contribution of the TCA cycle to the process of embryogenesis. To investigate whether the consumption of citrate is an essential process involved in embryogenesis, we focused on citrate synthase encoded by cts-1 gene that is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the TCA cycle. As shown in Fig. 1B, the levels of all TCA metabolites in early embryos were markedly decreased when cts-1 was silenced by feeding RNAi. Thus, cts-1 knockdown approach has allowed us to clarify the role of citrate consumption in early embryogenesis. The TCA cycle is an oxidative device coupled to the electron transport chain for the production of ATP and the genes responsible for the electron transport chain are known to be required for early embryogenesis (4Sönnichsen B. Koski L.B. Walsh A. Marschall P. Neumann B. Brehm M. Alleaume A.M. Artelt J. Bettencourt P. Cassin E. Hewitson M. Holz C. Khan M. Lazik S. Martin C. et al.Full-genome RNAi profiling of early embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2005; 434 (15791247): 462-46910.1038/nature03353Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Because cts-1 knockdown led to dysfunction of the TCA cycle, we hypothesized that cts-1 RNAi animals exhibit early developmental defects. As expected, cts-1 knockdown dramatically reduced hatching rate and also caused developmental arrest at the early embryonic stage (Fig. 2, A and B). Next, to test whether these phenotypes result from a failure of ATP production by cts-1 knockdown, we measured ATP levels in mock or cts-1 RNAi embryos using CE-TOF/MS. Surprisingly, however, the ATP levels of cts-1 RNAi embryos were comparable with those of mock RNAi embryos (Fig. 2C). Similar result was obtained using the luciferase-luciferin system (Fig. S1A). These data suggest that energy shortage is not a cause of early embryonic arrest in cts-1 RNAi animals. Several amino acids are synthesized from TCA metabolites, including α-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate. Thus, homeostatic imbalance of amino acids could be a possible explanation for early embryonic arrest by cts-1 knockdown. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the relative amounts of amino acids using CE-TOF/MS and found that glutamate and aspartate, which are derived from α-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate, respectively, were decreased in cts-1 RNAi embryos as compared with mock control (Fig. S1, B and C). Next, to determine whether reduction of glutamate and aspartate is sufficient to account for early embryonic arrest by cts-1 knockdown, we supplemented cts-1 RNAi embryos with an excess dose (30 mm) of glutamate and aspartate and examined hatching rate. Although the levels of glutamate and aspartate in cts-1 RNAi embryos were completely restored by the supplementation, this treatment failed to rescue the reduced hatching rate even when both glutamate and aspartate were added (Fig. 2, D–F). These observations imply that decreased levels of glutamate and aspartate do not account for early embryonic arrest by cts-1 knockdown. Alternatively, because it has been reported that citrate allosterically modulates metabolic enzymes, such as phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby controlling glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis (14Iacobazzi V. Infantino V. Citrate—new functions for an old metabolite.Biol. Chem. 2014; 395 (24445237): 387-39910.1515/hsz-2013-0271Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we assessed a direct effect of citrate depletion on the embryogenesis by adding back citrate to cts-1 RNAi embryos. However, consistent with the results of amino acid supplementation (Fig. 2, D–F), addition of citrate had no effect on the reduced hatching rate in cts-1 RNAi embryos, despite the fact that citrate levels were recovered to those in mock RNAi embryos (Fig. 2, G and H). Taken together, these results suggest that early embryonic arrest by cts-1 knockdown is not attributed to reduced levels of glutamate, aspartate, and citrate in C. elegans. As referred to above, our results demonstrated that at least production of ATP, amino acids, and citrate through the TCA cycle does not play a critical role in the hatching process of C. elegans. If so, what is the role of the TCA cycle in early embryogenesis? To find a clue to address this question, we performed LC-MS/MS analysis with mock and cts-1 RNAi embryos and found that acetyl-CoA, the starting point for the TCA cycle, is significantly increased by cts-1 knockdown (Fig. 3A). This finding raised the possible involvement of acetyl-CoA in early embryogenesis, and because acetyl-CoA serves as an acetyl donor for the acetylation as well as a source of ATP, we tested whether elevated levels of intracellular acetyl-CoA promotes acetylation of proteins in cts-1 RNAi embryos. Expectedly, Western blotting with an anti-acetyl lysine antibody showed that although only a few bands, probably histones, are detected as acetylated proteins in mock control, cts-1 knockdown apparently enhances the acetylation of a wide range of proteins (Fig. 3B). Next, to determine in which cellular compartment(s) hyperacetylation occurs in cts-1 RNAi embryos, we focused on mitochondria where the elevation of acetyl-CoA levels has been shown to induce lysine acetylation (12Ghanta S. Grossmann R.E. Brenner C. Mitochondrial protein acetylation as a cell-intrinsic, evolutionary driver of fat storage: Chemical and metabolic logic of acetyl-lysine modifications.CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2013; 48 (24050258): 561-57410.3109/10409238.2013.838204Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Total lysates from mock and cts-1 RNAi embryos were separated into mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial fractions as verified by Western blotting with organelle markers, and an increased acetylation was observed exclusively in mitochondrial fraction of cts-1 RNAi embryos (Fig. 3C). These data were further confirmed by proteome analysis, showing that a number of mitochondrial proteins, such as ACO-2, ATP-3, and HSP-6, are acetylated to a greater extent by cts-1 knockdown (Fig. S2). Next, we attempted to investigate whether early embryonic arrest by cts-1 knockdown would be because of aberrant hyperacetylation of proteins in C. elegans. To this end, as a potent acetylase inhibitor, we adopted the naturally occurring polyamines: spermidine and putrescine. It has been reported that spermidine inhibits acetyltransferase activity and its decline with age leads to hyperacetylation, early necrotic death, and decreased life span (15Eisenberg T. Knauer H. Schauer A. Büttner S. Ruckenstuhl C. Carmona-Gutierrez D. Ring J. Schroeder S. Magnes C. Antonacci L. Fussi H. Deszcz L. Hartl R. Schraml E. Criollo A. et al.Induction of autophagy by spermidine promotes longevity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11 (19801973): 1305-131410.1038/ncb1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 16Morselli E. Mariño G. Bennetzen M.V. Eisenberg T. Megalou E. Schroeder S. Cabrera S. Bénit P. Rustin P. Criollo A. Kepp O. Galluzzi L. Shen S. Malik S.A. Maiuri M.C. et al.Spermidine and resveratrol induce autophagy by distinct pathways converging on the acetylproteome.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192 (21339330): 615-62910.1083/jcb.201008167Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Besides, putrescine is interconvertible with spermidine. Exogenous supply of putrescine and spermidine to cts-1 RNAi animals caused a marked decrease in the extent of protein acetylation (Fig. 4A). Importantly, we found that the same experimental conditions enable amelioration of a reduced hatching rate of cts-1 RNAi embryos (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, polyamine treatment had no recovery effect on decreases in TCA metabolites and amino acids, glutamate and aspartate (Figs. S3, A–C). Taken together, these results suggest that the proper progression of the TCA cycle could be required for normal embryogenesis to prevent aberrant hyperacetylation of mitochondrial proteins in C. elegans. Although the rescue effect of polyamine in embryogenesis would be achieved through inhibition of hyperacetylation because of overproduction of acetyl-CoA, the detailed mechanism how polyamine reduces protein acetylation remains unclear. Meanwhile, we noticed key findings from the CE-TOF/MS data demonstrating that cts-1 knockdown augments the levels of acetylated polyamines, namely, acetylputrescine and acetylspermidine (Fig. 5A). These emerging data prompted us to consider that excess concentrations of polyamines might be sinks for the elevated acetyl-CoA levels as acetylation acceptors, thereby siphoning off the amount of acetyl-CoA for protein acetylation. To test this hypothesis, we set up to determine the levels of acetylspermidine in mock and cts-1 RNAi embryos treated with or without spermidine. Because amino groups of spermidine are acceptable for acetylation at both its ends (Fig. 5B), the two distinct mono- (N1- and N8-acetylspermidine) and the diacetylated (N1,N8-diacetylspermidine) forms of spermidine were measured specifically using LC-MS/MS. Unexpectedly, however, we found that the levels of all forms of acetylspermidine in cts-1 RNAi embryos are not significantly increased when treated with exogenous spermidine (Fig. 5, C–E). A similar result was observed in the levels of acetylputrescine (data not shown). These data indicate that polyamine-mediated inhibition of protein hyperacetylation is not attributed to the function of spermidine as a sink for acetyl groups under overproduction of acetyl-CoA. An alternative possible mechanism for polyamine-mediated inhibition of hyperacetylation could be the activation of protein deacetylase. Considering that polyamine treatment inhibited protein hyperacetylation occurring primarily in mitochondria, potential targets of polyamine should be the mitochondrial deacetylases, including three sirtuin isoforms, SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5. Among them, mammalian SIRT3 is the major protein deacetylase in mitochondria (10Hirschey M.D. Shimazu T. Jing E. Grueter C.A. Collins A.M. Aouizerat B. Stančáková A. Goetzman E. Lam M.M. Schwer B. Stevens R.D. Muehlbauer M.J. Kakar S. Bass N.M. Kuusisto J. et al.SIRT3 deficiency and mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation accelerate the development of the metabolic syndrome.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44 (21856199): 177-19010.1016/j.molcel.2011.07.019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), but there are no genes with similarity to SIRT3 and also SIRT5 in C. elegans. Instead, C. elegans possesses two genes, sir-2.2 and sir-2.3, both of which are orthologs of SIRT4 and their products are localized in mitochondria (17Wirth M. Karaca S. Wenzel D. Ho L. Tishkoff D. Lombard D.B. Verdin E. Urlaub H. Jedrusik-Bode M. Fischle W. Mitochondrial SIRT4-type proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals interact with pyruvate carboxylase and other acetylated biotin-dependent carboxylases.Mitochondrion. 2013; 13 (23438705): 705-72010.1016/j.mito.2013.02.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, because C. elegans SIR-2.2 and SIR-2.3 proteins have not been demonstrated to catalyze deacetylation on a variety of substrates, we first examined broad deacetylase activity of SIR-2.2 in mock and cts-1 RNAi embryos. As shown in Fig. 6A, we found that although endogenous protein acetylation levels of early embryos are comparable between WT N2 and sir-2.2(tm2648) mutant animals, cts-1 knockdown-induced hyperacetylation of proteins larger than 28 kDa is slightly augmented in sir-2.2(tm2648) mutant, suggesting that SIR-2.2 contributes to protein deacetylation, at least, when acetyl-CoA levels are elevated. We next investigated the role of sir-2.2 in spermidine-mediated inhibition of protein hyperacetylation under cts-1 knockdown condition. Notably, the inhibitory effect of spermidine on protein hyperacetylation in cts-1 RNAi embryos was completely abolished by deletion of sir-2.2 gene (Fig. 6B). In contrast, spermidine treatment substantially decreased the cts-1 knockdown-induced hyperacetylation in sir-2.3(ok444) mutants (Fig. 6C), indicating that not sir-2.3, but sir-2.2 is involved in the spermidine-mediated inhibition of protein hyperacetylation. Finally, we examined hatching rate of WT N2 and deletion mutants of sir-2.1 (the SIRT1 ortholog), sir-2.2, and sir-2.3 to ascertain whether sir-2.2 indeed plays a role in the spermidine-mediated recovery of embryonic development. As expected, the reduced hatching rates by cts-1 knockdown were observed in all strains tested, whereas the recovery effect of spermidine was partially abrogated in the sir-2.2(tm2468) mutant compared with N2 and other mutants (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these results imply that SIR-2.2 is a target of spermidine for preventing hyperacetylation when the TCA cycle is impaired during early embryogenesis. The fundamental question in this study is what the role of the TCA cycle during embryogenesis in C. elegans is. We demonstrated that the TCA cycle is indispensable for early embryonic development by RNAi depletion of CTS-1 that functions as the initial and rate-limiting enzyme of the TCA cycle (Fig. 1, A and B). Although ATP deprivation appeared to be a cause of early developmental arrest in cts-1 RNAi embryos, there was no difference in intracellular ATP levels between control and cts-1 RNAi embryos (Figs. 1C and S1A). This finding indicates that intracellular ATP levels are sustained during early embryogenesis even without ATP production through the TCA cycle. If so, what pathways are used for supplying ATP? We consider two possibilities: (1) through glycolysis and (2) through amino acid metabolism. To address this issue, we treated early embryos with 2-deoxyglucose, a glycolysis inhibitor, but no decrease was observed in ATP levels (data not shown), suggesting that glycolysis is not likely to participate in ATP supply during early embryogenesis. Another possibility is the use of amino acid as a substitute for acetyl-CoA to produce ATP. An interesting model has been proposed in which the TCA cycle reactions are split into complementary mini-cycles: namely, the first mini-cycle converts α-ketoglutarate to oxaloacetate and the second mini-cycle converts oxaloacetate to α-ketoglutarate (18Rustin P. Bourgeron T. Parfait B. Chretien D. Munnich A. Rötig A. Inborn errors of the Krebs cycle: A group of unusual mitochondrial diseases in human.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361 (9300800): 185-19710.1016/S0925-4439(97)00035-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Based on this model, the first mini-cycle would allow metabolizing glutamate for producing ATP even when the second mini-cycle does not function by cts-1 knockdown. Supporting this notion, we found that the levels of glutamate are considerably decreased in cts-1 RNAi embryos (Fig. S1B). Instead, the existence of multiple metabolic pathways to ensure the level of intracellular ATP implies other roles of the TCA cycle in early embryonic development. Here, we demonstrated the relationship between the TCA cycle and protein/metabolite acetylation through acetyl-CoA. The primary function of the TCA cycle is to release stored energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA into carbon dioxide and chemical energy in the form of ATP. As mentioned above, however, we revealed that ATP levels are not influenced by cts-1 knockdown and rather successive consumption of acetyl-CoA via the TCA cycle plays a crucial role in preventing accumulation of acetyl-CoA in mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Given that mitochondrial proteins possessing intrinsic acetyltransferase activity have not been identified so far (9Baeza J. Smallegan M.J. Denu J.M. Mechanisms and dynamics of protein acetylation in mitochondria.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41 (26822488): 231-24410.1016/j.tibs.2015.12.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), excessive accumulation of acetyl-CoA exclusively in mitochondria seems to cause aberrant acetylation of proteins and metabolite through the nonenzymatic reaction, thereby resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction related to early embryonic arrest. Moreover, it is noted that a large number of mitochondrial proteins involved in metabolic pathways have been shown to be regulated by reversible acetylation (7Lundby A. Lage K. Weinert B.T. Bekker-Jensen D.B. Secher A. Skovgaard T. Kelstrup C.D. Dmytriyev A. Choudhary C. Lundby C. Olsen J.V. Proteomic analysis of lysine acetylation sites in rat tissues reveals organ specificity and subcellular patterns.Cell Rep. 2012; 2 (22902405): 419-43110.1016/j.celrep.2012.07.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Taken together, we suggest the notion that homeostatic modulation of mitochondrial protein acetylation could be an alternative function of the TCA cycle at least during embryogenesis. Meanwhile, because blocking citrate synthase would have a number of effects beyond producing an excess amount of acetyl-CoA, it is important to provide evidence that increasing acetylation of mitochondrial proteins by a method except cts-1 knockdown also leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and early embryonic lethality. To prevent hyperacetylation of mitochondrial proteins, we used natural polyamines, such as spermidine, which has been reported to inhibit histone acetyltransferases and thereby promote longevity through up-regulation of autophagy-related transcripts (15Eisenberg T. Knauer H. Schauer A. Büttner S. Ruckenstuhl C. Carmona-Gutierrez D. Ring J. Schroeder S. Magnes C. Antonacci L. Fussi H. Deszcz L. Hartl R. Schraml E. Criollo A. et al.Induction of autophagy by spermidine promotes longevity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11 (19801973): 1305-131410.1038/ncb1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). In addition to the fact that a definitive mitochondrial acetyltransferase has not been identified, our findings from metabolome analysis led to the hypothesis that excess concentrations of polyamines might be sinks for the elevated acetyl-CoA levels by being acetylated themselves and thus siphon off the amount of acetyl-CoA for protein acetylation. However, because no significant increase in the levels of acetyl forms of spermidine, including N1-acetylspermidine, N8-acetylspermidine, and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine, was observed even when the TCA cycle was compromised by cts-1 knockdown (Fig. 5), this hypothesis appears to be incorrect at least in our experimental conditions. Instead, we discovered that the nematode mitochondrial sirtuin, SIR-2.2, has deacetylase activity, albeit at a lower level, and could be a target of spermidine-mediated inhibition of hyperacetylation (Fig. 6). Although we are unable to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying the action of polyamine on SIR-2.2 function, our findings provide new insight into the physiological significance of polyamine as an acetylation inhibitor. Interestingly, it was reported that N1,N8-diacetylspermidine is a potential cancer marker for early detection because its levels in the urine from patients are increased along with a progression of cancer (20Park M.H. Igarashi K. Polyamines and their metabolites as diagnostic markers of human diseases.Biomol. Ther. 2013; 21 (24009852): 1-910.4062/biomolther.2012.097Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, to date, there is no report describing the existence of N1,N8-diacetylspermidine in animals other than human and it remains unknown how N1,N8-diacetylspermidine is produced in cancer cells. In this study, we first discovered the endogenous production of N1,N8-diacetylspermidine in nematode when the TCA cycle is compromised by cts-1 knockdown (Fig. 5E). Considering that N1,N8-diacetylspermidine is predicted to arise simultaneously with the accumulation of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, this diacetylpolyamine could be a biomarker that identifies the metabolic balance between glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Our present study revealed a possible link among the TCA cycle, acetylation, and polyamine at the stage of early embryonic development in C. elegans. On the other hand, it is likely that this mutual relationship plays an important role in various biological phenomena throughout life. In particular, considering that spermidine is a longevity drug that can increase life span in yeast, nematodes, and flies (15Eisenberg T. Knauer H. Schauer A. Büttner S. Ruckenstuhl C.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11 (19801973): 1305-131410.1038/ncb1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), the acetylation status mediated by the TCA cycle is emerging as a promising regulatory mode of chronological aging. Consistent with this notion, a glucose-enriched diet has been shown to shorten life span by down-regulating the DAF-16 and HSF-1 transcription factors in C. elegans (21Lee S.J. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Glucose shortens the life span of C. elegans by down-regulating DAF-16/FOXO activity and aquaporin gene expression.Cell Metab. 2009; 10 (19883616): 379-39110.1016/j.cmet.2009.10.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Further investigations of the relationship between the TCA cycle and protein/metabolite acetylation in view of metabolic change with age will shed light on how spermidine increases longevity and also contributes to identify therapies to slow down aging and delay age-associated diseases. Bristol N2 WT, sir-2.1(ok434), and sir-2.3(ok444) were provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC). sir-2.2(tm2468) was obtained from National BioResource Project (NBRP). All mutants were backcrossed five times to N2. All strains were maintained on Nematode Growth Medium plates at 20 °C. To suppress the loss of the collected embryos and metabolites through the nonspecific adsorption with tubes and tips, we used platinum tubes and tips (BM-Bio Inc.) in all experiments. Reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Wako, Tokyo-INC, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., and Cayman Chemical Co. Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cell Signaling Technology, MBL International, and Abcam. N1,N8-diacetylspermidine was chemically synthesized and purified. The detailed information on reagents and antibodies is shown in Table S1. Early and late embryos were collected immediately and 11–12 h after bleaching of 5000 gravid adults, respectively. Embryos of mock RNAi or cts-1 RNAi were collected after thorough bleaching of ∼14,000 or 27,000 gravid adults, respectively. The embryonic pellets were stored at −80 °C. Chilled methanol and internal standards were added to the embryonic pellet. The mixture was sonicated. Metabolites were extracted by addition of chloroform and water. The upper phase was carefully transferred into new tubes and dried with a rotary concentrator at 4 °C. The dried pellet was resuspended in MS-grade distilled water and centrifuged. The supernatant was utilized for LC-MS and LC-MS/MS. Detailed procedures for LC-MS or LC-MS/MS analysis are shown in supporting experimental procedures (Table S2). Synchronized L1 animals were grown on Nematode Growth Medium plates seeded with Escherichia coli (OP50). Two hundred early L4 animals were transferred to RNAi plates containing ampicillin (100 mg/L) and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1.0 mm) seeded with E. coli (HT115) expressing target gene dsRNA, and embryos were examined after 45 h of RNAi treatment. In supplementation with metabolites, we prepared RNAi plates seeded with E. coli (HT115) and dropped metabolite water solution onto the surface of the agar so that final concentration was 30 mm or 60 mm, and then dried it just before transferring early L4 animals to RNAi plates. In this study, we used the plates as 30 mm or 60 mm metabolite supplementation plates. Chilled methanol and internal standards were added to the embryonic pellet. The mixture was sonicated four times. For metabolome analysis, the mixture was deproteinized with 5 kDa MW cutoff spin filter. The filtrate was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. The large-scale measurements and data processing of metabolites were performed through a facility service at Human Metabolome Technologies, Inc. (Tsuruoka, Japan). Early L4 animals were bred on RNAi plates for 45 h. Embryos of mock RNAi or cts-1 RNAi were collected after thorough bleaching ∼3000 or 4000 gravid adults, respectively. The embryonic pellets were boiled in 50 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.8% mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). Then, 5–10 μl of the lysates were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, and then the proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was treated with the blocking buffer, and then incubated with primary antibodies followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Table S1). Densitometric analyses of anti–acetylated-lysine Western blotting bands were performed by ImageJ software. Briefly, areas of Western blot bands larger than 28 kDa were framed as acetylated protein signals and then converted into gray values. After subtracting background values, the intensity profiles were determined and presented as a relative ratio. The acetylated protein signals larger than 28 kDa were divided into three sizes, namely: upper (> 75 kDa), middle (48–75 kDa), and lower (28–48 kDa) and then the linearity of signal intensities was validated by quantification of densitometric values of each area around 3-s exposure. Hatching rate was measured in reference to previous research (3Rahman M.M. Rosu S. Joseph-Strauss D. Cohen-Fix O. Down-regulation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle genes blocks progression through the first mitotic division in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In brief, early L4 animals were bred on RNAi plates for 45 h, and then 6–8 gravid adults were transferred to new RNAi plates. These animals were removed 6 h thereafter, and then hatchlings and eggs were counted 24 h later. In this fractionation, we referred to the protocol shown by Jonassen et al. (19Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Larsen P.L. Development and fertility in Caenorhabditis elegans clk-1 mutants depend upon transport of dietary coenzyme Q8 to mitochondria.J. Biol.

Large numbers of early embryos were collected by bleaching 35,000 gravid adults. The embryos were washed four times in M9 buffer, then resuspended in 2 ml of isolation buffer (IB) (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm PMSF). The samples were kept cold on ice throughout the fractionation procedure. The animals were homogenized with 15 up-and-down strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were saved, and 2 ml of IB were further added to the pellets. The pellets were resuspended and homogenized again with additional 15 strokes, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. An aliquot of the combined supernatants was saved as total lysate (TL). The supernatants were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were suspended with IB, and then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were saved, and another 1 ml of IB was added to the pellets. The pellets were resuspended and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. An aliquot of the combined supernatants was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the mitochondrial pellet (MP) was obtained. The supernatants centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min were additionally centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. An aliquot of the resulting supernatant was saved as post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS). Protein pellets of TL and PMS were collected by chloroform precipitation. SDS sample buffer was added to all pellets of TL, PMS, and MP. Results were presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significances were determined by two-tailed Student’s t test using GraphPad Prism software. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. K. Hada, K. Hirota, and A.

https://openalex.org/W2907802786,"One of the main challenges of bioremediation is to define efficient protocols with low environmental impact and high removal rates, such as static magnetic field (SMF). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of SMF exposure on the biodegradation rate of a mixture of pollutants using three bacterial strains which were isolated and identified from the Bizerte lagoon: Pseudomonas stutzeri LBR (KC157911), Cupriavidus metallidurans LBJ (KU659610) and Rhodococcus equi LBB (KU743870). To recognize the improvement role of SMF, the culture was submitted to a pre-treatment with SMF with an induction equal to 200 mT for 5 hours, after that the degradation experiment was followed with individual strains and with a consortium. Results showed an increase by 20% in the growth of the exposed bacterial population compared to controls, and 98% of biodegradation of DDT and 90% for BaP after 30 days of follow-up. This encouraging data opens new perspectives for a bioremediation bioprocess using SMF."
https://openalex.org/W2907871908,"C1q-like 4 (C1QL4), a novel member of the C1q- and TNF-related protein family, was found to be highly expressed in rodent and human testis. However, the localization, developmental, and hormonally regulated expression and biologic function of C1ql4 in the testis have not been investigated. Here, we demonstrated that C1ql4 mRNA and protein levels in murine testes gradually increased from the postnatal period to the adult stage and were up-regulated by LH in vivo. In situ hybridization demonstrated that the distribution and expression levels of C1ql4 mRNA varied at different developmental stages, although C1ql4 mRNA was detected in the seminiferous tubule and interstitial Leydig cells. Recombinant C1QL4 did not affect cell proliferation but did increase testosterone production in TM3 Leydig cells, as well as in cultured seminiferous tubules. C1QL4-induced testosterone secretion in Leydig cells was accompanied by increased expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein and steroidogenic enzymes. During this process, the c-Raf/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2/ERK1/2/mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 and cAMP/PKA/cAMP-responsive element binding protein signaling cascades were activated by C1QL4. The cell-adhesion GPCR brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 3 (BAI3), a putative receptor of C1QL4, was detected in the seminiferous tubule and interstitial Leydig cells during testicular development. Knockdown of Bai3 expression in Leydig cells led to a reduction in Star expression, accompanied by increases in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and intercellular cAMP levels. However, C1QL4-induced StAR expression was not completely suppressed in the Bai3-deficient Leydig cells, and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and intercellular cAMP levels were not significantly changed before and after C1QL4 stimulation. Our results suggested that although BAI3 played a role in C1QL4-induced steroidogenesis, there was an unidentified receptor that mediated C1QL4-activated testosterone secretion in Leydig cells through phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and up-regulation of intracellular cAMP levels. Taken together, our results showed, for the first time to our knowledge, that C1QL4 served as a novel acute regulator of testosterone secretion, and BAI3 functioned as a new receptor that is involved in steroidogenesis in Leydig cells. BAI3-independent ERK1/2 activation and cAMP activation mediated C1QL4-induced testosterone secretion. This study expanded the reproductive roles and mechanisms of C1QL4 and BAI3 signaling pathways.—Tan, A., Ke, S., Chen, Y., Chen, L., Lu, X., Ding, F., Yang, L., Tang, Y., Yu, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2907977381,"Background Overweight is known as a risk factor for ischemic stroke. However, the effect of weight change on the development of ischemic stroke remains controversial. We investigated the relationship between weight change and the risk of ischemic stroke using a nationwide population-based cohort. Methods Our study enrolled 11,084,683 participants (Mean age 49.7±13.5 years, range 20–114 years) in the Korean National Health Screening Program from 2009 to 2012. Weight change was calculated using the difference between the baseline weight and the weight at health screening four years prior to the baseline. The occurrence of newly-diagnosed ischemic stroke was observed until the end of 2015. We categorized the study population according to weight change and performed multivariable analysis to compare the risk. Results Ischemic stroke was newly diagnosed in 113,591 subjects. The crude incidence rates of ischemic stroke per 1000 person-years according to the change in body weight were 3.059, 1.906, and 1.491 in the <-5%, ±5%, and ≥+5% groups, respectively. After adjusting all variables, the hazard ratio (HR) of ischemic stroke was higher in subjects who underwent weight loss (HR 1.152) or weight gain (HR 1.087) than in those who maintained their weight. When analyzed by eight groups of 5% intervals, the risk showed a U-shaped curve with those who maintained their weight showing the lowest risk. Conclusions The risk of ischemic stroke was gradually increased in those who lost or gained more than 5% of their weight over four years, after adjusting for confounders. We should be aware of the increased risk of ischemic stroke in people who undergo weight change and should identify and manage the cause of weight change."
https://openalex.org/W2908395672,"Cortical sensory neurons are characterized by selectivity to stimulation. This selectivity was originally viewed as a part of the fundamental ""receptive field"" characteristic of neurons. This view was later challenged by evidence that receptive fields are modulated by stimuli outside of the classical receptive field. Here, we show that even this modified view of selectivity needs revision. We measured spatial frequency selectivity of neurons in cortical area MT of alert monkeys and found that their selectivity strongly depends on luminance contrast, shifting to higher spatial frequencies as contrast increases. The changes of preferred spatial frequency are large at low temporal frequency, and they decrease monotonically as temporal frequency increases. That is, even interactions among basic stimulus dimensions of luminance contrast, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency strongly influence neuronal selectivity. This dynamic nature of neuronal selectivity is inconsistent with the notion of stimulus preference as a stable characteristic of cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2906971533,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death due to cancer in women. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subgroup with unique behavior. There is a controversy in organ involvement in metastasis. In this study, we planned to define the prognostic factors, survival, and recurrence incidence of patients.Among the 583 patients with breast mass referred to hematology and oncology clinic in Shariati hospital, Tehran, Iran from March 2005 to March 2015, fifty four patients entered the survival analysis whom we followed for two years until March 2017. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) and Cumulative recurrence incidences (RI) were estimated. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to assess risk factors in predicting OS and DFS.Median follow up for the patients was 5.00 years. The five-year OS, DFS and RI were 86.13% (95% CI (71.42-93.59), 63.09% (95% CI (47.04-75.49) and 32.15% (95% CI (19.52-47.43) respectively. Among the factors studied OS, DFS and RI differed significantly only between patients with and without nodal involvement (P = 0.004, P = 0.003, and P = 0.02 respectively). On the other hand, based on the univariate modeling, patients with nodal involvement had a higher risk of breast cancer-specific death (HR: 17.99, P = 0.004). Furthermore, patients with nodal involvement had a higher risk of breast cancer-specific death or recurrence (HR = 5.64, P = 0.008). In Multivariate model, just the nodal involvement significantly changed the hazard for OS (HR = 23.91, P = 0.001). As the nodal involvement was the only significant risk factor at the 0.2 level of significance, we can consider the hazard ratio of lymph node positivity in DFS univariate models as adjusted hazard.The only factor with significant effect on OS, DFS and RI was nodal involvement in the pathology report."
https://openalex.org/W2907230270,"The use of remote desktop services on virtualized machines is a general trend to reduce the cost of desktop seats. Instead of assigning a physical machine with its operating system and software to each user, it is considerably easier to manage a light client machine that connects to a server where the instance of the user’s desktop machine actually executes. Citrix and VMware have been major suppliers of these systems in private clouds. Desktop-as-a-Service solutions such as Amazon WorkSpaces offer a similar functionality, yet in a public cloud environment. In this paper, we review the main offerings of remote desktop protocols for a cloud deployment. We evaluate the necessary network resources using a traffic model based on self-similar processes. We also evaluate the quality of experience perceived by the user, in terms of image quality and interactivity, providing values of Mean Opinion Score (MOS). The results confirm that the type of application running on the remote servers and the mix of users must be considered to determine the bandwidth requirements. Applications such as web browsing result in unexpectedly high traffic rates and long bursts, more than the case of desktop video playing, because the on-page animations are rendered on the server."
https://openalex.org/W2907373713,"Primary blood coagulation and wound sealing are orchestrated by von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric glycoprotein. Upon release of arginine vasopressin (AVP), VWF containing high molecular weight multimers is secreted. By measuring copeptin, the C-terminal part of the AVP prohormone, we recently found strongly increased AVP levels in children with febrile seizures (FS) as compared to children with fever but without seizures. It is unknown if increased AVP levels in FS are of any biological function. Therefore, our a priori hypothesis was that children with FS have increased VWF parameters in parallel with higher AVP levels.We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study of children aged between 6 months and 5 years. Children that presented at our emergency department with fever or a recent FS (within four hours) were evaluated to be included to the study. We measured serum copeptin and VWF parameters, including analyses of VWF:Antigen (WVF:Ag), VWF:collagen binding activity (VWF:CB) and VWF multimers in children with FS, febrile infections without seizures and additionally, in a non-febrile control group.We included 54 children in our study, 30 with FS, 10 in the febrile control group, and 14 in the non-febrile control group. Serum copeptin levels were significantly higher in children with FS (median [IQR] 24.73 pmol/l [13.65-68.65]) compared to the febrile control group (5.66 pmol/l [4.15-8.07], p = 0.002) and the non-febrile control group (4.78 pmol/l [3.33-5.3], p<0.001). VWF:CB levels were also significantly higher in children with FS (VWF:CB 2.29 U/ml [1.88-2.97]) as compared to the febrile (VWF:CB 1.41 U/ml [1.27-1.93], p = 0.048) and the non-febrile control group (VWF:CB 1.15 U/ml [0.98-1.21], p<0.001). VWF:Ag tended to be higher in children with FS compared to both control groups. Multivariate regression analysis revealed FS and copeptin as major determinants of VWF:CB.Our results suggest that increased secretion of AVP in children with FS is associated with higher plasma levels of VWF parameters. Especially VWF:CB may serve as additional biomarker in the diagnosis of FS."

Moreover, the importance of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) family in biology and disease is very well known because of its central role in Alzheimer disease. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the independently folded E2 domain of APLP2 and compared that with its paralogues APP and APLP2, demonstrating high overall structural similarities. The crystal structure of APLP2 E2 was solved as an antiparallel dimer, and analysis of the protein interfaces revealed a distinct mode of dimerization that differs from the previously reported dimerization of either APP or APLP1. Analysis of the APLP2 E2 metal binding sites suggested it binds zinc and copper in a similar manner to APP and APLP1. The structure of this key protein might suggest a relationship between the distinct mode of dimerization and its biologic functions.—Roisman, L. C., Han, S., Chuei, M. J., Connor, A. R., Cappai, R.

https://openalex.org/W2906872095,"Members of the millipede order Julida rely on dominantly quinonic defensive secretions with several minor, non-quinonic components. The free radical-scavenging activities of ethanol, methanol, hexane, and dichloromethane extracts of defensive secretions emitted by Pachyiulus hungaricus (Karsch, 1881) and Megaphyllum unilineatum (C. L. Koch, 1838) were investigated using the ABTS, DPPH, and total reducing power (TRP) tests. The obtained extracts were also tested for inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase activity. Finally, the antifungal potential of both julid extracts was evaluated against seven Fusarium species. Secretions of both species showed activity against free radicals, acetylcholinesterase, tyrosinase, and all of the selected fungal species. The secretions of P. hungaricus exhibited a more potent antioxidative effect than did those of M. unilineatum, while there were no significant differences of antiacetylcholinesterase activity between the tested extracts. Only the hexane extract of M. unilineatum showed an effect on tyrosinase activity stronger than that of P. hungaricus. Fusarium sporotrichioides, F. graminearum, and F. verticillioides were the fungi most resistant to secretions of both julids. The Fusarium species most susceptible to the secretion of P. hungaricus was F. avenaceum, while the concentrations of M. unilienatum extracts needed to inhibit and completely suppress fungal growth were lowest in the case of their action on F. lateritium. Our data support previous findings that julid defensive secretions possess an antimicrobial potential and reveal their antioxidative and antineurodegenrative properties. Bearing in mind the chemical complexity of the tested defensive secretions, we presume that they can also exhibit other biological activities."

https://openalex.org/W2906697139,"The increasing amount of clinical research conducted outside the “traditional” countries raises questions about the benefits of hosting offshored clinical research. The extent to which trials contribute to the scientific knowledge base and, in particular, whether there are differences between different types of trials remain open questions. By examining a change in clinical trial regulations in India, a country often viewed as a first-choice offshoring location, we study how the relaxation of clinical trial regulations affects the number and the type of clinical trials as well as the domestic scientific knowledge base. Based on trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov and data on associated publication activities, our empirical analysis suggests that, despite an initial increase in the number of clinical trials, relaxing clinical trial regulations has a limited impact on the domestic scientific knowledge base. More specifically, the number of Indian researchers involved in the production of trial-related scientific knowledge remains modest. Furthermore, the potential to learn from the additional trials appears to be limited: the influx of phase 3 trials—mainly sponsored by Western-pharmaceutical firms—is accompanied by a lower likelihood that the trial results will be used in Indian researchers’ subsequent research activities when compared to phase 3 trials with preceding phase 2 trials, as was required before the regulatory change. Overall, our results contradict expectations that relaxing the regulatory requirements for conducting late-stage clinical trials is an appropriate means of supporting the development of the domestic scientific knowledge base."
https://openalex.org/W2907359700,"The study of brood parasitism has traditionally been focused on the breeding period, but recent evidence suggests that it urgently needs a new spatio-temporal perspective to explore novel avenues on brood parasite-host co-evolutionary interactions. Many brood parasites are migrants, but their ecology outside their short breeding season is poorly known. The great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius) is one of the classical models in the study of brood parasitism, however, there is very little information on its migratory strategy, route and wintering grounds. Furthermore, there is no previous information on the geographical distribution of mortality and its causes in this species; information that is critical to understand the fluctuations in cuckoo populations and detect potential conservation risks. Using satellite tracking technology, we provide novel insight into the migratory behavior and performance of the great spotted cuckoo. We found individuals from southern Spain to be long-distance nocturnal migrants that use the East Atlantic Flyway for both post and pre-breeding migration, and that winter in the western Sahel. We found evidence of individual variation in their migration route, particularly regarding their post-breeding behavior in Spain. Our study also suggests that the south of Morocco is the most dangerous area due to a large number of deaths during the post-breeding migratory period. Furthermore, we found that natural predation seems to be the main cause of death, probably due to raptors, although human activities (i.e. hunting) could also played a role in the southern Mediterranean shore. Our study offers novel findings and challenges traditional ideas on the ecology of this species providing a good example of how the new spatio-temporal perspective can expand our knowledge on brood parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2907908768,"Optimization of an artificial neural network model through the use of optimization algorithms is the common method employed to search for an optimum solution for a broad variety of real-world problems. One such optimization algorithm is the kidney-inspired algorithm (KA) which has recently been proposed in the literature. The algorithm mimics the four processes performed by the kidneys: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion. However, a human with reduced kidney function needs to undergo additional treatment to improve kidney performance. In the medical field, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) test is used to check the health of kidneys. The test estimates the amount of blood that passes through the glomeruli each minute. In this paper, we mimic this kidney function test and the GFR result is used to select a suitable step to add to the basic KA process. This novel imitation is designed for both minimization and maximization problems. In the proposed method, depends on GFR test result which is less than 15 or falls between 15 and 60 or is more than 60 a particular action is performed. These additional processes are applied as required with the aim of improving exploration of the search space and increasing the likelihood of the KA finding the optimum solution. The proposed method is tested on test functions and its results are compared with those of the basic KA. Its performance on benchmark classification and time series prediction problems is also examined and compared with that of other available methods in the literature. In addition, the proposed method is applied to a real-world water quality prediction problem. The statistical analysis of all these applications showed that the proposed method had a ability to improve the optimization outcome."

The provided models share similarities with collective decision making models inspired by honeybees and evolutionary games. As first contribution, we develop an evolutionary game-theoretic model that accommodates the different consensus dynamics in a unified framework. As second contribution, we study equilibrium points and extend such study to the symmetric case where the transition probabilities of the evolutionary game dynamics are symmetric. Symmetry is associated with the case of equally favourable options. As third contribution, we study stability of the equilibrium points for the different cases.

Initial tests of selected Group 3 human medulloblastoma cell lines in culture showed that D283 Med and D425 Med were resistant to cytosine arabinoside and methotrexate. D283 Med cells were also resistant to topotecan, whereas 1 μM topotecan killed over 99% of D425 Med cells. We therefore introduced D425 Med cells, modified to express firefly luciferase, into the CSF of immunodeficient mice. Mice were then treated with topotecan or saline in five groups: continuous intraventricular (IVT) topotecan via osmotic pump (5.28 μg/day), daily bolus IVT topotecan injections with a similar daily dose (6 μg/day), systemic intraperitoneal injections of a higher daily dose of topotecan (15 μg/day), daily IVT pumped saline and daily intraperitoneal injections of saline. Bioluminescence analyses revealed that both IVT topotecan treatments effectively slowed leptomeningeal tumor growth in the brains. Histological analysis showed that they were associated with localized brain necrosis, possibly due to backtracking of topotecan around the catheter. In the spines, bolus IVT topotecan showed a trend towards slower tumor growth compared to continuous (pump) IVT topotecan, as measured by bioluminescence. Both continuous and bolus topotecan IVT showed longer survival compared to other groups. Thus, both direct IVT topotecan CSF delivery methods produced better anti-medulloblastoma effect compared to systemic therapy at the dosages used here."
https://openalex.org/W2950602174,"Microhemorrhages are common in the aging brain and are thought to contribute to cognitive decline and the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Chronic aspirin therapy is widespread in older individuals and decreases the risk of coronary artery occlusions and stroke. There remains a concern that such aspirin usage may prolong bleeding after a vessel rupture in the brain, leading to larger bleeds that cause more damage to the surrounding tissue. Here, we aimed to understand the influence of aspirin usage on the size of cortical microhemorrhages and explored the impact of age. We used femtosecond laser ablation to rupture arterioles in the cortex of both young (2–5 months old) and aged (18–29 months old) mice dosed on aspirin in their drinking water and measured the extent of penetration of both red blood cells and blood plasma into the surrounding tissue. We found no difference in microhemorrhage size for both young and aged mice dosed on aspirin, as compared to controls (hematoma diameter = 104 +/- 39 (97 +/- 38) μm in controls and 109 +/- 25 (101 +/- 28) μm in aspirin-treated young (aged) mice; mean +/- SD). In contrast, young mice treated with intravenous heparin had an increased hematoma diameter of 136 +/- 44 μm. These data suggest that aspirin does not increase the size of microhemorrhages, supporting the safety of aspirin usage."

https://openalex.org/W2900088787,"This article explores how probabilistic programming can be used to simulate quantum correlations in an EPR experimental setting. Probabilistic programs are based on standard probability which cannot produce quantum correlations. In order to address this limitation, a hypergraph formalism was programmed which both expresses the measurement contexts of the EPR experimental design as well as associated constraints. Four contemporary open source probabilistic programming frameworks were used to simulate an EPR experiment in order to shed light on their relative effectiveness from both qualitative and quantitative dimensions. We found that all four probabilistic languages successfully simulated quantum correlations. Detailed analysis revealed that no language was clearly superior across all dimensions, however, the comparison does highlight aspects that can be considered when using probabilistic programs to simulate experiments in quantum physics."
https://openalex.org/W2908413090,"When I left my tenured professorship for a nonacademic job, I thought I had already done the hard part: making the decision to leave the professional world that had been my home for many years. I had little inkling of the culture shock that awaited me in my new sphere of science policy and how disorienting it would be. In the 17 years since, I've seen that I'm far from the only one who struggles with this transition. Regardless of career stage, leaving academia requires some adjusting. For those who, like me, make the move later in their careers, after decades as established academics, it can be even harder. Knowing what to expect beforehand can take some of the shock out of the transition to the world outside academia.

YOU AREN'T THE CENTER OF THE WORLD, AND YOU WILL HAVE AN ACTUAL BOSS. If you're a senior academic, teaching, advising, and managing a research group can turn your world into a solipsistic universe where what you say goes. Most students are attentive and agreeable, no matter what they really think. The dean and department chair are loosely construed as your supervisors, but they generally want you to focus on your own ideas so that you can bring in grant money and prestige.

Outside of academia, on the other hand, collaboration in service of a common goal is far more important than any one person's ideas. That is true even if you are in a very senior leadership role. There are goals to achieve and relationships to manage; you can't pursue just your own interests. Having a more formal boss might feel odd, but be open to it. Bosses can offer support in ways that university structures can't.

YOU WON'T HAVE NEARLY ENOUGH TIME TO DO THE BACKGROUND WORK YOU'D LIKE. Completeness and thorough examination are hallmarks of a serious scholar. In academia, you can usually take all the time you need to do plenty of background research, talk to colleagues, and cogitate before producing a decision or a publication. But in the outside world, you may have 30 minutes to come up with an answer. This was a particularly hard lesson for me to learn. Sage advice from someone more junior than I but with more “real world” work experience helped immensely. They said that sometimes I just had to go with my gut and call it a day.

SUMMER IS NOT SPECIAL. After a long academic year, summer feels different and, in some ways, special. It can be a time to regroup and refresh—write, develop ideas, even spend a few months away from the distractions of campus. Outside of academia, summer is generally three more months in the workplace. It might be punctuated by vacation, but by and large, work goes on as usual for 12 months a year.

THERE IS NO TENURE. This is a tough one! Many in the professoriate value this near-guarantee of steady employment for a lifetime. But leaving tenure can actually be liberating for a go-getter with a good work ethic. Employers want to keep strong, creative employees around, and they realize that individuals are not necessarily there for life. That means that organizations can be very loyal to their long-term, high-performing employees and treat them well. And if you don't enjoy the work or feel badly treated, there's no reason to stay.

If you decide to take the plunge into the outside world, take some time to acclimate to the new environment. You'll probably experience some initial surprises, but give yourself a chance to see whether things get better. And if this article convinces you that academia is the right place for you and that you should stay and flourish there, then that is a win, too.

In this study, a repeatable semi-automatic protocol capable of providing a 3D realistic developmental map of the prenatal mouse knee joint was designed by combining Optical Projection Tomography imaging (OPT) and a deformable registration algorithm (Sheffield Image Registration toolkit, ShIRT). Eleven left limbs of healthy murine embryos were scanned with OPT (voxel size: 14.63μm) at two different stages of development: Theiler stage (TS) 23 (approximately 14.5 embryonic days) and 24 (approximately 15.5 embryonic days). One TS23 limb was used to evaluate the precision of the displacement predictions for this specific case. The remaining limbs were then used to estimate Developmental Tibia and Femur Maps. Acceptable uncertainties of the displacement predictions computed from repeated images were found for both epiphyses (between 1.3μm and 1.4μm for the proximal tibia and between 0.7μm and 1.0μm for the femur, along all directions). The protocol was found to be reproducible with maximum Modified Housdorff Distance (MHD) differences equal to 1.9 μm and 1.5 μm for the tibial and femoral epiphyses respectively. The effect of the initial shape of the rudiment affected the developmental maps with MHD of 21.7 μm and 21.9 μm for the tibial and femoral epiphyses respectively, which correspond to 1.4 and 1.5 times the voxel size. To conclude, this study proposes a repeatable semi-automatic protocol capable of providing mean 3D realistic developmental map of a developing rudiment allowing researchers to study how growth and adaptation are directed by biological and mechanobiological factors."
