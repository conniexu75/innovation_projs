https://openalex.org/W2036799174,"Budding yeast grown under continuous, nutrient-limited conditions exhibit robust, highly periodic cycles in the form of respiratory bursts. Microarray studies reveal that over half of the yeast genome is expressed periodically during these metabolic cycles. Genes encoding proteins having a common function exhibit similar temporal expression patterns, and genes specifying functions associated with energy and metabolism tend to be expressed with exceptionally robust periodicity. Essential cellular and metabolic events occur in synchrony with the metabolic cycle, demonstrating that key processes in a simple eukaryotic cell are compartmentalized in time."

https://openalex.org/W2060181803,"To study the genetic basis of natural variation in gene expression, we previously carried out genome-wide linkage analysis and mapped the determinants of approximately 1,000 expression phenotypes. In the present study, we carried out association analysis with dense sets of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from the International HapMap Project. For 374 phenotypes, the association study was performed with markers only from regions with strong linkage evidence; these regions all mapped close to the expressed gene. For a subset of 27 phenotypes, analysis of genome-wide association was performed with >770,000 markers. The association analysis with markers under the linkage peaks confirmed the linkage results and narrowed the candidate regulatory regions for many phenotypes with strong linkage evidence. The genome-wide association analysis yielded highly significant results that point to the same locations as the genome scans for about 50% of the phenotypes. For one candidate determinant, we carried out functional analyses and confirmed the variation in cis-acting regulatory activity. Our findings suggest that association studies with dense SNP maps will identify susceptibility loci or other determinants for some complex traits or diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2172287039,"Molecules capable of mimicking the function of a wide range of mechanical devices have been fabricated, with motors that can induce mechanical movement attracting particular attention1,2. Such molecular motors convert light or chemical energy into directional rotary or linear motion2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, and are usually prepared and operated in solution. But if they are to be used as nanomachines that can do useful work, it seems essential to construct systems that can function on a surface, like a recently reported linear artificial muscle11. Surface-mounted rotors have been realized and limited directionality in their motion predicted12,13. Here we demonstrate that a light-driven molecular motor capable of repetitive unidirectional rotation14 can be mounted on the surface of gold nanoparticles. The motor design14 uses a chiral helical alkene with an upper half that serves as a propeller and is connected through a carbon–carbon double bond (the rotation axis) to a lower half that serves as a stator. The stator carries two thiol-functionalized ‘legs’, which then bind the entire motor molecule to a gold surface. NMR spectroscopy reveals that two photo-induced cis-trans isomerizations of the central double bond, each followed by a thermal helix inversion to prevent reverse rotation, induce a full and unidirectional 360° rotation of the propeller with respect to the surface-mounted lower half of the system."

Studies were performed to identify proteins that interact with CFP1 to gain insight into the molecular function of this protein. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry reveal that human CFP1 associates with a ∼450-kDa complex that contains the mammalian homologues of six of the seven components of the Set1/COMPASS complex, the sole histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase in yeast. In vitro assays demonstrate that the human Set1/CFP1 complex is a histone methyltransferase that produces mono-, di-, and trimethylated histone H3 at Lys4. Confocal microscopy reveals that CFP1 and Set1 co-localize to nuclear speckles associated with euchromatin. A Set1 complex of reduced mass persists in murine embryonic stem cells lacking CFP1. These cells carry elevated levels of methylated histone H3-Lys4 and reduced levels of methylated histone H3-Lys9. Together with the previous finding of reduced levels of cytosine methylation, these data indicate that cells lacking CFP1 contain reduced levels of heterochromatin. Furthermore, ES cells lacking CFP1 exhibit a 4-fold excess of histone H3-Lys4 methylation following induction of differentiation, indicating that CFP1 restricts the activity of the Set1 histone methyltransferase complex. These results reveal a mammalian counterpart to the yeast Set1/COMPASS complex. The presence of CFP1 in this complex implicates this protein as a critical epigenetic regulator of histone modification in addition to cytosine methylation and reveals one mechanism by which this protein intersects with the epigenetic machinery.

Targeted disruption of the CXXC1 gene results in peri-implantation embryonic lethality in mice (21Carlone D.L. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a developmental stage associated with global remodeling of chromatin structure and cytosine methylation patterns (22Lee J-H. Hart S.R.L. Skalnik D.G. Genesis. 2004; 38: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 23Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 24Reik W. Dean W. Walter J. Science. 2001; 293: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). CXXC1-/- embryonic stem (ES) cells exhibit a 60-80% decrease in global cytosine methylation, including hypomethylation of repetitive genomic elements, single copy genes, and imprinted genes (25Carlone D.L. Lee J-H. Young S.R.L. Dobrota E. Butler J.S. Ruiz J. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4881-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity is reduced 60% in CXXC1-/- ES cells and expression of Dnmt1 protein is also reduced, although de novo DNA methyltransferase activity is normal (25Carlone D.L. Lee J-H. Young S.R.L. Dobrota E. Butler J.S. Ruiz J. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4881-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cytosine methylation deficiencies observed in CXXC1-/- ES cells, although dramatic, cannot account for the severity of the observed phenotype. For example, ES cells lacking Dnmt1 exhibit a 90% reduction in Dnmt activity and cytosine methylation, yet exhibit normal growth prior to in vitro differentiation (26Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, undifferentiated CXXC1-/- ES cells exhibit a lengthened doubling time as a consequence of an increased rate of apoptosis (25Carlone D.L. Lee J-H. Young S.R.L. Dobrota E. Butler J.S. Ruiz J. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4881-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, mouse embryos lacking Dnmt1 die later in gestation (8.5-9.5 days post-coitus) (26Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) compared with CXXC1-/- embryos (4.5-6.5 days post-coitus) (21Carlone D.L. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Finally, decreased Dnmt activity and Dnmt1 protein levels in CXXC1-/- ES cells are unlikely to fully explain the observed deficiency in genomic cytosine methylation, as Dnmt1+/- ES cells express reduced Dnmt1 protein but retain normal levels of cytosine methylation (27Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar, 28Chan M.F. Van Amerongen R. Jijjar T. Cuppen E. Jones P.A. Laird P.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 21: 7587-7600Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The existence of CFP1 homologues in lower eukaryotes that lack CpG methylation, such as yeast and C. elegans, provides additional circumstantial evidence for a function of CFP1 that is independent of cytosine methylation. Interestingly, sequence alignment reveals that CFP1 homologues in organisms that lack CpG methylation lack the CXXC DNA-binding domain (data not shown). The yeast CFP1 homologue, Spp1, is a component of the multimeric Set1 histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase complex (also known as COMPASS) (2Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 29Nagy P.L. Griesenbeck J. Kornberg R.D. Cleary M.L. Proc.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). This is the sole histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase in yeast and is also required for telomeric and rDNA silencing (31Krogan N.J. Dover J. Khorrami S. Greenblatt J.F. Schneider J. Johnston M.

Biol. 2002; 12: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Set1 is recruited by the RNA polymerase II elongation machinery to actively expressed genes (33Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Ryan O.W. Golshani A. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Mol.

Mol Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The subsequent deposition of H3K4me3 at these genomic sites provides a localized mark of recent transcriptional activity. Spp1 is dispensable for histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase activity in S. cerevisiae but is necessary for methyltransferase activity in S. pombe (35Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Aasland R. Shevchenko A. Stewart A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8487-8493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Given the presence of yeast Spp1 within a histone-modifying complex and the severity of the CXXC1-/- phenotype in mice, we hypothesized that mammalian CFP1 may play a role in the control of histone modification and chromatin structure in addition to facilitating cytosine methylation. The studies reported here demonstrate that CFP1 is a component of a mammalian Set1 histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase that is analogous to the yeast Set1/COMPASS complex. Furthermore, CXXC1-/- ES cells exhibit perturbed global patterns of histone modification, demonstrating that CFP1 is a critical epigenetic regulator of both cytosine methylation and histone methylation. Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were cultured and transfected as described (20Lee J-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42259-42267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and transfected cells were selected in 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Mouse ES cells were cultured and differentiated in vitro as described (22Lee J-H. Hart S.R.L. Skalnik D.G. Genesis. 2004; 38: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). ES cell lines either homozygous or heterozygous for a disrupted CXXC1 allele were generated from blastocysts derived from matings between CXXC1+/- mice (21Carlone D.L. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as described (25Carlone D.L. Lee J-H. Young S.R.L. Dobrota E. Butler J.S. Ruiz J. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4881-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CXXC1-/- ES cells were transfected with a CFP1 cDNA expression vector to produce rescued cells (CXXC1-/cDNA) or were transfected with empty expression vector as a control (CXXC1-/vector), as described previously (25Carlone D.L. Lee J-H. Young S.R.L. Dobrota E. Butler J.S. Ruiz J. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4881-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions—FLAG-tagged human CFP1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen). cDNA of human Set1 (KIAA0339) was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. This cDNA clone carried a single nucleotide deletion, which was corrected by reverse transcription PCR amplification of this region and substitution into the cDNA clone. Ash2 (BC015936), Rbbp5 (BC037284), and Wdr5 (BC001635) cDNA were amplified from expressed sequence-tagged clones obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. hSwd2 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from HEK-293 RNA. The cDNA clones were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector that contains an amino-terminal FLAG epitope. The cDNA of human CFP1 (1Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pEGFP-C2 and pcDNA3-FLAG vectors (20Lee J-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42259-42267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cDNA for human Set1 was similarly cloned into the pEGFP-C2 vector. The nucleotide sequence of all constructs was confirmed. Purification of a CFP1 Complex—HEK-293 cells expressing FLAG-CFP1 were incubated in hypotonic buffer for 10 min on ice and homogenized, and nuclei were harvested by centrifugation. Ten milliliters of extraction buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, supplemented with the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin (1 μg/ml each), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100) was added and incubated for 10 min on ice. The pellets were extensively Dounce homogenized on ice. The solubilized nuclear fraction was separated by centrifugation and used for immunoprecipitation. FLAG-IgG-agarose slurry (Sigma) was added, incubated for 3 h, and washed five times with 12 ml of extraction buffer. Bound proteins were eluted twice with 0.5 ml of extraction buffer containing 250 μg/ml FLAG peptide. Combined eluants were loaded onto 10-50% sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 18 h using a SW41 rotor (Beckman). Five-hundred-milliliter fractions were collected. Molecular markers were applied to a parallel gradient, and their migration was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions enriched for CFP1 (#9-12) were pooled and subjected to a second round of FLAG immunoprecipitation. Bound proteins were similarly eluted and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-4 concentrator (100 kDa cut-off). Samples were separated by 4-12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coommassie Brilliant Blue or silver stain, and protein bands were excised for in-gel trypsin digestion. Peptides were extracted and desalted on C18-Ziptips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol and resuspended in 10 μl of 30% methanol, 0.5% acetic acid. The peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Indiana University Protein Analysis and Research Center), and protein identity was determined using the ProFound search engine (129.85.19.192/profound_bin/WebProFound.exe). Histone Methyltransferase Assay—Histone methyltransferase assays were performed on the immunoprecipitated Set1/CFP1 complex, as described previously (36Strahl B.D. Ohba R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Either 10 μg of core histones purified from chicken erythrocytes (Upstate Biotechnology), 2 μg of recombinant histone H3 or recombinant histone H4 purified from Escherichia coli (Upstate Biotechnology), or 10 μg of core histones purified by acid extraction (22Lee J-H. Hart S.R.L. Skalnik D.G. Genesis. 2004; 38: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) from HEK-293 cells were used for methyltransferase reactions. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and fluorography. Alternatively, reaction products were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed by Western blotting using modification-specific antisera. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analysis—Nuclear extract preparations and FLAG immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. For CFP1, Ash2, and Rbbp5 immunoprecipitations, nuclear extracts were precleared and incubated with antibodies for 1 h and incubated with protein-A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h. Protein-A-agarose beads were washed four times with extraction buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Polyclonal anti-CFP1 antiserum has been described previously (1Voo K.S. Carlone D.L. Jacobsen B.M. Flodin A. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell.

Anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma; anti-H3K4me2 and anti-H3K9me2 antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology; anti-BRG1 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-H3K4me3, anti-H3K9me3, anti-H3K4me1, and anti-histone H3 antibodies were obtained from Abcam; anti-Ash2 and anti-Rbbp5 antibodies were obtained from Bethyl Laboratories; and anti-Set1 amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal antibodies were obtained from Abgent. Anti-Set1 antibody was a kind gift of Winship Herr (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Anti-MEP50 antibody was a kind gift of Gideon Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania). Core histones were isolated from ES cells as described (22Lee J-H. Hart S.R.L. Skalnik D.G. Genesis. 2004; 38: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). ES cells (∼108 cells) were harvested and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer containing 10 mm sodium butyrate. Cells were resuspended with 10 ml of cell lysis buffer and lysed by 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in 5 ml of wash buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm sodium butyrate, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine). The nuclear suspension was overlaid onto 5 ml of a sucrose cushion (30% sucrose in wash buffer) and subjected to centrifugation at 2400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were resuspended in a minimum volume of wash buffer. For acid extraction of histones, an equal volume of ice-cold 0.8 m HCl was added and stirred on ice for 2 h, and the acid-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The histone-containing supernatant was saved. The pellet was re-extracted as above, and the supernatants were combined. The histones were precipitated by adding 8 volumes of acetone and incubating at -20 °C overnight. The histones were recovered by centrifugation. The histone pellets were washed twice with freshly prepared acetone/100 mm HCl (10:1) solution and then washed three times with acetone. The histone pellets were dried at room temperature and reconstituted with water. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, an equivalent amount of core histone was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. Following electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE, proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were seeded onto a cover glass at 2-5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well dish and grown for 24 h, fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, and washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and a blocking solution (PBS containing 2.5% normal serum and 0.2% Tween 20) was added and incubated for 1 h. Anti-FLAG antiserum (1:1000) was added and incubated for 2 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 5 min. Secondary antibody labeled with Texas Red (2 μg/ml in blocking solution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and incubated for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 5 min. Nuclear counterstaining was performed with 0.1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 5 min followed by washing with PBS. Cells were mounted with 10 μl of Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) and scanned with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. CFP1 Is a Component of the Mammalian Set1 Complex—HEK-293 cells were stably transfected with an expression vector containing the FLAG-CFP1 cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer (or the empty expression vector). These cells express FLAG-CFP1 at a level ∼80% of endogenous CFP1 (data not shown). Nuclear extracts isolated from these cells were subjected to sucrose gradient equilibrium centrifugation (Fig. 1A). Both endogenous CFP1 and FLAG-CFP1 are present in a complex of ∼450 kDa. The migration of CFP1 is not affected by the presence of 500 mm NaCl (data not shown), illustrating the stability of the CFP1 complex. To determine the composition of this complex, nuclear extracts were subjected to FLAG immunoprecipitation, followed by sucrose gradient equilibrium centrifugation. Sucrose gradient fractions enriched for CFP1 were pooled, subjected to a second round of FLAG immunoprecipitation, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, B and C). Six major protein bands were detected. Analysis by mass spectrometry reveals that many of these proteins represent human homologues of components of the yeast Set1/COMPASS histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase complex, including Set1 (XP_049380.2), homologue to yeast Set1 (BLAST score of 214); Ash2 (NP_004665.1), homologue to yeast Bre2 (BLAST score of 62); Wdr5 (also known as BIG-3, NP_060058.1), homologue to the yeast WD repeat protein Swd3 (BLAST score of 162); hSwd2 (XP_293514.1), homologue of the yeast protein Swd2 (BLAST score of 168); and Rbbp5 (also known as RBQ-3, NP_005048.1), the human homologue of the yeast WD40 repeat protein Swd1 (BLAST score of 150). Last, the WD40 domain protein MEP50 (38Friesen W.J. Wyce A. Paushkin S. Abel L. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8243-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was also detected by mass spectrometry, although this protein does not correspond to a Set1/COMPASS homologue. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed to further assess the authenticity of the putative Set1/CFP1 complex. Set1, Ash2, MEP50, and Rbbp5 were each detected by immunoblot following immunoprecipitation of FLAG-CFP1 (Fig. 1D). However, MEP50 was also detected following immunoprecipitation of the vector control extract, indicating that the presence of this factor in the original FLAG immunoprecipitation was an artifact. Antisera directed against hSwd2 and Wdr5 were not available for these studies. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies were also performed. Because immunoprecipitating antisera directed against Set1, Wdr5, and hSwd2 were not available, FLAG-tagged expression vectors for each of these factors were stably introduced into HEK-293 cells. All six components of the CFP1 complex were detected by immunoblot following immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against CFP1, Ash2, or Rbbp5 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, FLAG immunoprecipitation of cells expressing FLAG-Set1, FLAG-Wdr5, or FLAG-hSwd2 led to recovery of CFP1, Set1, Ash2, and Rbbp5 (Fig. 2B). No signal was detected when immuoprecipitations were performed on HEK-293 cells transfected with an empty expression vector. The Set1/CFP1 complex was further analyzed by Western analysis following sucrose gradient fractionation. All six components of the Set1/CFP1 complex were detected in the ∼450 kDa size range, although the majority of the FLAG-Wdr5 and FLAG-hSwd2 proteins was found in a smaller size range (Fig. 2C). Previous work documented that CFP1 localizes to euchromatin nuclear speckles (20Lee J-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42259-42267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Co-localization studies using confocal microscopy demonstrated that CFP1 exhibits a subnuclear distribution that is entirely distinct from heterochromatin markers such as HP1α and MeCP2 but partially overlapping with euchromatin markers such as acetylated histones, sites of transcription, and RNA splicing (20Lee J-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42259-42267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was performed to determine the subnuclear localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Set1 fusion protein in HEK-293 cells. GFP-Set1 fusion protein is found in nuclear speckles that are largely excluded from DAPI-bright regions (heterochromatin), indicating a euchromatin localization (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, consistent with the biochemical data presented above, FLAG-CFP1 and GFP-Set1 colocalize to sub-nuclear regions that are distinct from regions of DAPI-bright heterochromatin (Fig. 3B). The Set1/CFP1 Complex Exhibits Histone H3-Lys4 Methyltransferase Activity—Because other mammalian complexes containing Set1-like proteins exhibit histone methyltransferase activity (15Hughes C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2073865076,"Tn syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease in which subpopulations of blood cells in all lineages carry an incompletely glycosylated membrane glycoprotein, known as the Tn antigen. This truncated antigen has the sugar N-acetylgalactosamine α-linked to either a serine or threonine amino-acid residue1,2, whereas the correct T antigen has an additional terminal galactose; the defect may be due to a malfunction of the glycosylating enzyme T-synthase3,4. Here we show that Tn syndrome is associated with a somatic mutation in Cosmc, a gene on the X chromosome that encodes a molecular ‘chaperone’ that is required for the proper folding and hence full activity of T-synthase5. The production of the autoimmune Tn antigen by a glycosyltransferase enzyme rendered defective by a disabled chaperone may have implications for other Tn-related disorders such as IgA nephropathy, a condition that can result in renal failure."

https://openalex.org/W2035457970,"An electron propagating through a solid carries spin angular momentum in addition to its mass and charge. Of late there has been considerable interest in developing electronic devices based on the transport of spin, which offer potential advantages in dissipation, size, and speed over charge-based devices. However, these advantages bring with them additional complexity. Because each electron carries a single, fixed value (-e) of charge, the electrical current carried by a gas of electrons is simply proportional to its total momentum. A fundamental consequence is that the charge current is not affected by interactions that conserve total momentum, notably collisions among the electrons themselves. In contrast, the electron's spin along a given spatial direction can take on two values, ""up"" and ""down"", so that the spin current and momentum need not be proportional. Although the transport of spin polarization is not protected by momentum conservation, it has been widely assumed that, like the charge current, spin current is unaffected by electron-electron (e-e) interactions. Here we demonstrate experimentally not only that this assumption is invalid, but that over a broad range of temperature and electron density, the flow of spin polarization in a two-dimensional gas of electrons is controlled by the rate of e-e collisions."

These results have raised the interesting possibility that sequence differences between the pro-domain of LOX and LOXL account for some of the functional differences observed for the two enzymes. Production of a mature and functional elastic fiber is a complex process that is only partially understood. Monomers of elastin (tropoelastin) are cross-linked in the extracellular space by one or more members of the lysyl oxidase (LO) 3The abbreviations used are: LOlysyl oxidaseLOXlysyl oxidaseLOXLlysyl oxidase-likeΔmatmature region deletedΔproproregion deletedFLfull-lengthPCPpro-collagen C proteinaseRFL-6rat fetal lung fibroblasts-6TEtropoelastinPBSphosphate-buffered salineECMextracellular matrixCterC terminusADactivating domainBDbinding domain. gene family to form an elastin polymer, which is the functional form of the mature protein. Fibrillin-containing microfibrils are thought to play an important role in the assembly process by serving as a scaffold for aligning cross-linking domains within tropoelastin. Recently, several other proteins, such as members of the fibulin and emilin families, have been suggested to play a role in elastic fiber formation, although their exact function has not yet been determined (1Keeley F.W. Alatawi A. Lab. Investig. 1991; 64: 499-507PubMed Google Scholar). lysyl oxidase lysyl oxidase lysyl oxidase-like mature region deleted proregion deleted full-length pro-collagen C proteinase rat fetal lung fibroblasts-6 tropoelastin phosphate-buffered saline extracellular matrix C terminus activating domain binding domain. LOs are extracellular copper-requiring enzymes that catalyze the cross-linking of collagen and elastin through oxidative deamination of lysine or hydroxylysine side chains. The resultant allysine residues can then spontaneously condense with vicinal peptidyl aldehydes or with ϵ-amino groups of peptidyl lysines to generate covalent cross-linkages. There are five members of the LO family: lysyl oxidase (LOX) and lysyl oxidase-like 1–4 (LOXL 1–4) (reviewed in Ref. 2Csiszar K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 70: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of all of the LO family members contains the elements required for catalytic activity (the copper binding site, tyrosyl and lysyl residues that contribute to the carbonyl cofactor, and 10 cysteine residues), and the high sequence homology in this region suggests that all family members share a common enzymatic mechanism. The N-terminal regions, in contrast, show the greatest variability in size and sequence. The genes for LOX and LOXL have a similar exon structure consisting of seven exons, five of which (exons 2–6) are of similar size and encode proteins with 76% amino acid identity (3Kim Y.H. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7176-7182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Differences between LOX and LOXL reside mainly in sequences coded by exon 1. In LOX, exon 1 codes for a signal peptide, a putative pro-enzyme region, and the beginning of the mature enzyme. In LOXL, this exon is larger than exon 1 in LOX and encodes a proline-rich region. Both LOX and LOXL are enzymatically active after processing from their secreted pro-forms by procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) or mammalian tolloid proteinases (4Borel A. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J.

LOXL-2, -3, and -4 are the largest family members and have cysteine-rich scavenger receptor-like domains in their N-terminal region that are not found in LOX and LOXL. The substrate preferences or specificities of the various LO family members are not known. LOX and LOXL are the best studied, and both have been shown in vitro to use tropoelastin as a substrate (4Borel A. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Kessler E. Gleyzal C. Hulmes D.J. Sommer P. Font B. J.

Ultrastructural analysis shows poorly developed, fragmented, and discontinuous elastic fibers in aorta, lung, and skin. LOXL-null mice, in contrast, have a mild connective tissue phenotype characterized by pelvic laxity in female animals and enlarged pulmonary air spaces that result from decreased elastin content 4Ian Hornstra, unpublished results.

A recent study of LOX and LOXL distribution in the developing mouse (12Hayashi K. Fong K.S. Mercier F. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. Hayashi M. J. Mol. Histol. 2004; 35: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) found co-localization of both enzymes in the tissues that are most affected in the knock-out animals. Heart, lung, and skin, for example, have overlapping localization of LOX and LOXL. Furthermore, both enzymes co-localize to the same elastic fibers of human skin using immunoelectron microscopy (13Noblesse E. Cenizo V. Bouez C. Borel A. Gleyzal C. Peyrol S. Jacob M.P. Sommer P. Damour O. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 621-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that even if LOX and LOXL have the same catalytic activity and are expressed in the same tissues, they appear to not have completely redundant roles in elastic fibers formation and homeostasis. The reason that one enzyme may not compensate for the other in the knock-out animals may relate to differing substrate specificities resulting from substrate interaction determinants outside of the catalytic domain. The present studies were undertaken to determine how LOX and LOXL are targeted to elastic fibers. A recombinant approach was developed to study the role of each domain of LOX and LOXL in a lung RFL-6 fibroblast model. Direct protein binding assays were also used to characterize the binding region for LOX and LOXL within tropoelastin. Our results showed that the pro-regions of LOX and LOXL play a significant role in directing the deposition of both enzymes onto elastic fibers by mediating interactions with tropoelastin. This has raised the interesting possibility that functional differences between the two enzymes will be manifested when LOX and LOXL are still pro-enzymes. Materials—All reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. Antibodies—A polyclonal antibody against human recombinant LOX (anti-LOX228–279) was used as described (13Noblesse E.

Dermatol. 2004; 122: 621-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for LOX immunolocalization and Western blot analysis. For LOXL Western blot analysis, a polyclonal antibody against human recombinant LOXL (anti-LOXL355–416) was used as described (13Noblesse E. Cenizo V. Bouez C. Borel A. Gleyzal C. Peyrol S. Jacob M.P. Sommer P. Damour O. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 621-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A new polyclonal antibody against recombinant mouse LOXL (anti-LOXL204–393) was used for immunolocalization of LOXL. This antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbits with the C-terminal two-thirds (45 kDa, starting with the sequence VYYRG) of the mouse LOXL cDNA cloned into the EcoRI site of pET-28b and purified from a bacterial extract using metal affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. A smaller 20-kDa fragment consisting of the N-terminal region of the 45-kDa protein ending with VGSVY and not containing the catalytic domain was expressed in bacteria and purified. Antisera to the 45-kDa fragment were affinity-purified by absorption against the smaller 20-kDa recombinant fragment that was covalently bound to Ultra-link resin (Pierce). This purification removed antibodies reactive toward the common catalytic domain, yielding antibodies specific for LOXL. Other antibodies used in this study were polyclonal antibodies to the N-terminal portion of mouse recombinant tropoelastin (N6–17) (14Kozel B.A. Wachi H. Davis E.C. Mecham R.P. J. Biol.

Schematics of the chimeras are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The LOX constructs that were expressed in this study include: (a) full-length (FL) murine LOX (FL-LOX-V5); (b) LOX with its pro region deleted (Δpro) (Δpro-LOX-V5); and (c) unmaturable LOX, with its PCP maturation site deleted (ΔPCP) (ΔPCP site-LOX-V5). These constructs have been characterized previously (16Seve S. Decitre M. Gleyzal C. Farjanel J. Sergeant A. Ricard-Blum S. Sommer P. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). LOX with its catalytic (i.e. mature) domain deleted (Δmat) (Δmat-LOX-V5) was generated by subcloning a BamHI-ApaI fragment of ΔPCP-LOX-V5 into a new pcDNA4-V5/His vector. An expression construct for full-length human LOXL (FL-LOXL-V5) has been described previously (17Morris S.M. Kagan H.M. Stone P.J. Snider G.L. Albright J.T. Anat. Rec. 1986; 215: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Several steps were required to generate a Δpro-LOXL-V5 and Δmat-LOXL-V5 plasmid. First, a mutant of the FL-LOXL-V5 vector containing an XhoI site at +910 was generated using PCR primers (5′-TCTCGAGCCCACGCCTGGGCTGG-3′ and 5′-TACTCGAGCCATGGGCCTGCGCC-3′). The mutant fragment was then cut using BamHI and XhoI and inserted in-frame before the V5/His sequence of a new pcDNA4-V5/His vector, thereby generating the Δmat-LOXL-V5 plasmid. The Δpro-LOXL-V5 plasmid was generated by cutting the mutant vector with SmaI and XhoI and filling the resultant linearized vector with Klenow fragment followed by self-ligation.FIGURE 4Deletion of putative proregion decreased, but did not completely inhibit, LOXL-V5 deposition on elastic fibers. RFL-6 cells transfected with human FL, Δpro,- or Δmat-LOXL-V5 expression constructs were stained with antibodies against the V5 epitope tag (left column) and with the tropoelastin N6–17 antibody (middle column). A merge of the two labels is presented in the right column. LOXL-V5 was deposited onto elastic fibers (A–C), whereas Δpro-LOXL-V5 was secreted but did not associate with the extracellular matrix (D–F). The deposition of Δmat-LOXL-V5 was restricted to fibers close to transfected cells (G–I). Images were acquired with a ×40 objective at a final optical magnification of ×400. The localization of recombinant LOXL-V5 to elastic globules is shown in J, which is a merged image of LOXL-V5 and tropoelastin staining. It was acquired using a ×100 objective. Scale bars represents 50 μm. The expression of all of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the cell culture medium and cell layer extracts using the V5 antibody (K and L).

Three days after visual confluency and immediately before transfection, the culture medium was replaced with fresh growth medium without antibiotic, and the cells were transfected with 4 μg of the appropriate plasmid using 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then incubated for 48 h before immunostaining or extraction of recombinant proteins. Protein Extraction, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot Analysis—To study the secretion of recombinant LOs, medium from 48 h-transfected or untransfected cells was collected. After clearing by centrifugation, 2 ml of supernatant were incubated with 50 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) for 45 min at 4 °C. After two washes in 20 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, the resins were collected, and proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. Cell layers were lysed using 8 m urea in 16 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7, harvested, and diluted in a 16 mm Na2HPO4 buffer to a final concentration of 2 m urea. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After 30 min, the samples were rinsed in cold acetone, solubilized in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) for 1 h at 70 V in 10 mm 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid, 10% methanol (v/v). Membranes with transferred protein were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with specific primary antibodies for 1 h (anti-LOX228–279 and anti-LOXL355–416 antibodies were used at 1:400, anti-V5 at 1:2000), and then washed three times with blocking agent. The membranes were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG or horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed twice, and detected with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein molecular mass markers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. To characterize the time course of endogenous LOX and LOXL expression, RFL-6 cells were seeded at 30% confluency into 6-well plates. Two days before confluency and 1, 3, 5, and 8 days after confluency, proteins were extracted from cell layers and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Indirect Immunofluorescence Detection—Cultures of untransfected and transfected RFL-6 cells, plated as described above, were washed with PBS and fixed with cold methanol. Nonspecific immunoreactivity was blocked with heat-denatured 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cell layers were then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed by several washes in blocking buffer and a second incubation with the appropriate fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Slides were washed three times and mounted with Gel/Mount™ (Biomeda, Forest City, CA). Fluorescence was examined with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope coupled with a Zeiss AxioCam CCD camera. Images acquired with a ×40 objective were recorded using Zeiss AxioVision software. All antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. Anti-LOX228–279 and anti-LOXL204–393 antibodies were diluted 1:500. Rat tropoelastin was detected using N6–17 diluted 1:400. Anti-V5 antibody was diluted 1:2000. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse was used to detect anti-V5 antibodies, and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit was used to detect anti-LOs antibodies, whereas Alexa Fluor 596 goat anti-rabbit was used to detect the polyclonal antibodies against tropoelastin. All were diluted 1:1000. Mammalian Two-hybrid and Dual-Luciferase Assays—For mammalian two-hybrid assays, HeLa cells (4 × 105 cells) were seeded onto 6-well plates. When the cells reached ≥80% confluency after about 24 h, the medium was replaced with OptiMEM (Invitrogen) immediately before transfection, and the cells were transfected with 200 ng of the appropriate pBIND-X, 200 ng of pACT-Y, 100 ng of pG5LUC. Negative controls include empty vector pBIND and pACT. pBIND-Id vector and pACT-MyoD served as positive controls. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The luciferase activity is recorded in relative light units using a luminometer. Cell transfection efficiency and protein expression are standardized by Renilla luciferase expression of the pBIND vector, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The background signal resulting from AD-TE-Cter alone is eliminated by dividing each result by the results obtained with pAD-TE-Cter + empty pBIND. The ratio of luciferase activity obtained was characteristic of a positive interaction when this ratio was greater than 1. Expression and Purification of Tropoelastin and Fragments—A full-length tropoelastin construct, generated from the bovine-C variant, was cloned into the PQE expression system using a BamHI linker in place of the initiator methionine as described previously (18Park P.W. Roberts D.D. Grosso L.E. Parks W.C. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23399-23406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subfragments were generated from the full-length construct using restriction enzyme digestions. The exon 1–15 construct was a HindIII fragment and represents amino acid residues 2–274. The exon 15–36 construct begins at the HindIII site and represents amino acid residues 275–747. The residue numbering is based on the translated bovine A splice variant (accession number P04985) beginning with the initial methionine (19Raju K. Anwar R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5755-5762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bovine C variant has exons 13 and 14 spliced out. Full-length constructs and fragments of recombinant bovine tropoelastin were expressed as His6 fusion proteins with the pQE vectors (Qiagen) in the M-15 strain of E. coli. Expressed proteins were initially purified using nickel chromatography under denaturing conditions using the batch purification method described by Qiagen. Eluted tropoelastin or tropoelastin fragments were dialyzed against 50 mm acetic acid, lyophilized, and then further purified using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydak 214TP510 C-4 column using a 0–50% of acetonitrile gradient. Peak fractions were dried by rotary evaporation, dissolved in MilliQ water, and then lyophilized. Purity of the expressed proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE using 8–25% PhastGels (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Translation Product and Recombinant Protein—The V5 plasmids were used as DNA templates for in vitro translation with TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The translation products were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, analyzed by autoradiography, and used as antigen substrate in ligand blot assay. Ligand Blot Analysis—TE peptides were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels under non-reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose as described above. The blots were blocked after transfer with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature. 100 μl of LOX or LOXL generated by in vitro translation were added to the blocking solution, and the blots were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C under gentle shaking. The blots were washed three times in blocking agent and dried. Autoradiography was used to detect bound, radiolabeled proteins generated by in vitro translation. Endogenous LOX and LOXL Are Targeted to Extracellular Fibers of Lung Fibroblasts—RFL-6 cells were used as a model system to study the synthesis, secretion, and targeting of lysyl oxidase to the extracellular matrix, particularly to elastic fibers. RFL-6 cells are derived from fetal rat lung mesenchyme. They produce LOX (20Chen L.J. Zhao Y. Gao S. Chou I.N. Toselli P. Stone P. Li W. Toxicol Sci. 2005; 83: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and deposit an elaborate fibrillar matrix containing fibrillin-1, fibrillin-2, tropoelastin (21Kozel B.A. Ciliberto C.H. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and other ECM proteins. To characterize the time course of endogenous LOX and LOXL expression, endogenous proteins were extracted from the cell layer 2 days before and 1, 3, 5, and 8 days after confluency. LOX and LOXL were then detected by Western blot analysis using polyclonal LOX228–279 and LOXL355–416 antibodies. LOX was identified in the cell layer as a 50-kDa precursor and a 32-kDa mature form (Fig. 1A). A weaker band was also detected at 48 kDa, which has been described as the prepro-enzyme without glycosylation. LOXL was expressed as a 60-kDa precursor and a mature form at 31 kDa (Fig. 1B). LOX and LOXL expression occurred throughout the culture period, whereas maturation was highest around 3 days of confluency (Fig. 1, A and B) at a time when RFL-6 cells start to produce and assemble extracellular matrix components (21Kozel B.A. Ciliberto C.H. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A band slightly smaller than 200 kDa was detectable after 8 days of confluency and most likely resulted from LOXL polymerization. To localize LOs in the extracellular matrix, RFL-6 cells were fixed days after confluency and stained with LOX228–279 5 and LOXL204–393 antibodies. These antibodies will detect both precursor and mature forms of the respective enzymes. Immunostaining of permeabilized RFL-6 cell cultures showed LOX and LOXL to be distributed intracellularly throughout the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus and in secretary vesicles (data not shown). The enzymes were also detected on fibrous extracellular matrix (Fig. 2, A and B) at a time when RFL-6 produced elastic fibers (21Kozel B.A. Ciliberto C.H. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The specificity of the LOXL204–393 antibody was established by showing immunoreactivity with an appropriately sized band in 6 m urea extracts of wild type but not LOXL knock-out adult mouse heart and lung (Fig. 2C). The specificity of anti-LOX228–279 has been established previously (13Noblesse E. Cenizo V. Bouez C. Borel A. Gleyzal C. Peyrol S. Jacob M.P. Sommer P. Damour O. J. Investig.

To determine the functional consequences of Gab2 overexpression, we utilized the immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. In monolayer culture, expression of Gab2 at levels comparable with those detected in human breast cancer cells accelerated epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell cycle progression and was associated with increased basal Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced and/or more sustained EGF-induced Erk and Akt activation. Three-dimensional Matrigel culture of MCF-10A cells resulted in the formation of polarized, growth-arrested acini with hollow lumina. Under these conditions, Gab2 increased cell proliferation during morphogenesis, leading to significantly larger acini, an effect dependent on Gab2 binding to Grb2 and Shp2 and enhanced by recruitment of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK revealed that, in addition to direct activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, increased Erk signaling also contributed to Gab2-mediated enhancement of acinar size. In addition, Gab2 overcame the proliferative suppression that normally occurs in late stage cultures and conferred independence of the morphogenetic program from exogenous EGF. Finally, higher levels of Gab2 expression led to the formation of large disorganized structures with defective luminal clearance. These findings support a role for Gab2 in mammary tumorigenesis.

Docking proteins represent an important class of signal transducer utilized by receptor and receptor-associated tyrosine kinases (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3456) Google Scholar). Upon receptor activation, these proteins localize to the plasma membrane via an N-terminal domain (e.g. a pleckstrin homology domain in the case of Gab 7The abbreviations used are: GabGrb2-associated binderDOSdaughter of SevenlessSHSrc homologyRANKreceptor activator of NF-κBGrb2growth factor receptor-bound 2Erkextracellular signal-regulated kinaseEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinStatsignal transducer and activator of transcriptionRbretinoblastoma proteinMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase.7The abbreviations used are: GabGrb2-associated binderDOSdaughter of SevenlessSHSrc homologyRANKreceptor activator of NF-κBGrb2growth factor receptor-bound 2Erkextracellular signal-regulated kinaseEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinStatsignal transducer and activator of transcriptionRbretinoblastoma proteinMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase./DOS proteins) and, following tyrosine phosphorylation at multiple sites, act to recruit a variety of SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins. Docking proteins thereby function as plasma membraneproximal assembly platforms that mediate signal localization, amplification, and integration. The Gab/DOS family of docking proteins is represented by three paralogs in mammals (Gab1–3) and one ortholog each in Drosophila (DOS) and Caenorhabditis (SOC-1) (2Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab proteins has been reported in response to activation of a plethora of cell-surface receptors, including several classes of receptor tyrosine kinases, T- and B-cell antigen receptors, RANK, and β1-integrins (2Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 3Gu H. Neel B.G.

Med. 2005; 11: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although Gab1 can bind the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase directly (6Lock L.S. Frigault M.M. Saucier C. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30083-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), association of Gab1 and Gab2 with receptor signaling complexes is often mediated by the adaptor protein Grb2 (3Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The latter binds the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor or a receptor-associated protein via its SH2 region and the Gab protein via its C-terminal SH3 domain. An important signaling function of Gab proteins is to bind and activate the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, resulting in enhanced and/or more sustained Ras/Erk signaling (3Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Shp2 can positively regulate Ras activation by dephosphorylating Ras GTPase-activating protein recruitment sites on the EGFR (7Agazie Y.M. Hayman M.J. Mol. Cell.

A second key pathway downstream of Gab proteins is activation of PI3K because Gab1–3 exhibit three YXXM motifs that mediate recruitment of the p85 subunit of this enzyme. In addition, Gab1 and Gab2 both bind Crk adaptors, and Gab1 couples to phospholipase Cγ (2Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 3Gu H.

Although Gab3-deficient mice lack an obvious phenotype, suggesting functional redundancy with the other family members (11Seiffert M. Custodio J.M. Wolf I. Harkey M. Liu Y. Blattman J.N. Greenberg P.D. Rohrschneider L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2415-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Gab1 and Gab2 perform unique functions in normal and pathological states. Gab1 gene knockouts display embryonic lethality, probably due to the key role played by Gab1 in Met signaling (12Itoh M. Yoshida Y. Nishida K. Narimatsu M. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice lacking Gab2, which has a more tissue-specific expression pattern, exhibit impaired mast cell-mediated allergic responses and osteoclast differentiation due to a requirement for Gab2 downstream of Fcϵ receptor I and RANK, respectively (5Wada T.

Furthermore, Gab2 is strongly implicated in oncogenic signaling. Gab2 S159A, which is uncoupled from negative feedback phosphorylation by Akt, displays potent transforming properties in fibroblasts, identifying Gab2 as a proto-oncogene product (15Lynch D.K. Daly R.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Also, Gab2 is essential for the transformation of fibroblasts by the v-Sea tyrosine kinase oncoprotein (16Ischenko I. Petrenko O. Gu H. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6311-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and of myeloid cells by Bcr-Abl (17Sattler M. Mohi M.G. Pride Y.B. Quinnan L.R. Malouf N.A.

Chan G. Kutok J.L. Cohen S. Morgan K. Boulton C. Shigematsu H. Keilhack H. Akashi K. Gilliland D.G. Neel B.G. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 179-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Finally, Gab2 is overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancer specimens (19Daly R.J. Gu H. Parmar J. Malaney S. Lyons R.J. Kairouz R. Head D.R. Henshall S.M. Neel B.G. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5175-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is now well established that signaling by specific receptor tyrosine kinases plays key roles in both mammary gland development and tumorigenesis. For example, in the normal mammary gland, the ErbB receptor signaling network functions in ductal outgrowth, alveolar morphogenesis, and lactation (20Troyer K.L. Lee D.C. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas in breast cancer, overexpression of either EGFR/ErbB1 or ErbB2 is associated with a more aggressive disease phenotype (21Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). Consequently, given the oncogenic potential of Gab2 and its common overexpression in breast cancers, an important unresolved question is the functional consequences of elevated Gab2 expression in normal mammary epithelial cells. To address this, we have exploited the characteristics of the spontaneously immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. Upon three-dimensional culture in reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel), these cells form acinar structures that retain important characteristics of glandular epithelium in vivo, such as apicobasal polarization, suppression of proliferation, and acinar cavitation through apoptosis of cells located within the inner cell mass (22Shaw K.R. Wrobel C.N. Brugge J.S. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2004; 9: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This three-dimensional culture system provides a powerful model for characterizing the biological activities of proteins implicated in breast cancer development and progression. Effects observed upon overexpression and/or constitutive activation of particular oncoproteins include lack of proliferative suppression (cyclin D1), luminal filling, development of multiacinar structures (ErbB2), and disruption of cell-cell adhesion in acini (colony-stimulating factor receptor) (23Debnath J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that, depending on its expression level in MCF-10A cells, Gab2 is capable of conferring increased acinar size, resistance to proliferative suppression within acinar structures, independence of the morphogenetic program from exogenous EGF, and defective luminal clearance, thus supporting a role for Gab2 in breast cancer development. Mutation Detection—Genomic DNA was extracted from 32 cancer cell lines (17 breast, 12 ovarian, and three prostate) and four cell lines from normal breast tissue using conventional methods. Detection of genetic variation was performed using PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (26Wu Y. Hayes V.M. Osinga J. Mulder I.M. Looman M.W. Buys C.H. Hofstra R.M.

Amplified products showing aberrant denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis banding patterns were subjected to automated sequencing using an ABI 3100 gene analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Retroviral Vectors—A cDNA insert encoding human Gab2 with a C-terminal HA tag was excised from pcDNA3.1/Gab2-HA 9D. K. Lynch and R. J. Daly, unpublished data. by XbaI/HindIII digestion, blunted, and subcloned into the HpaI site of the retroviral vector pMIG (also known as pMSCV-IRES-GFP (28Van Parijs L. Refaeli Y. Lord J.D.

The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate pMIG/Gab2 expression vectors encoding Gab2 mutants lacking the binding sites for Grb2 (ΔGrb2), p85 (Δp85), and Shp2 (ΔShp2). In brief, the ΔGrb2 mutant was generated by deleting the 351PPPRPPKP358 sequence, representing a typical Grb2-binding site, and by performing two alanine substitutions to mutate the atypical Grb2-binding site from 510PPPVNR515 to PAPVNA (29Lock L.S. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31536-31545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The other mutants were generated by performing phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr614 and Tyr643 (ΔShp2) and Tyr452, Tyr476, and Tyr584 (Δp85). 10Primer details are available upon request. The coding sequences of all Gab2 mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Retroviral Infection of MCF-10A Cells—Monolayer cultures of MCF-10A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% (v/v) horse serum (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml human recombinant EGF (R&D Systems), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin G (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). For growth factor stimulation experiments, cells were starved overnight in 0.2% (v/v) horse serum prior to treatment with 10 ng/ml EGF. For cell cycle analysis of cells grown in monolayer culture, MCF-10A cells were starved for 34 h in 0.2% (v/v) horse serum and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF. Relative cell numbers were estimated using a non-radioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega) after up to 5 days of EGF treatment, and doubling times were calculated from lines of best fit during exponential growth. For the establishment of three-dimensional cultures, cells grown in monolayer culture were detached by trypsin/EDTA treatment and seeded in precoated glass chamber slides as described previously (30Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in assay medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 2% (v/v) horse serum, cholera toxin, hydrocortisone, penicillin G, and streptomycin sulfate as described above) at 2.5 × 104 cells/ml. 8- or 4-well glass chamber slides were coated with 40 or 80 μl of Matrigel/well, respectively, and left to solidify in the incubator for 1 h. The cells were then mixed with an equal volume of assay medium containing 4% (v/v) Matrigel, which was supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF and 10 μg/ml insulin or with either EGF or insulin alone. The cell suspension was then added to the 4- or 8-well chamber slides to yield 5 × 103 or 1 × 104 cells/well, respectively. This time point was taken as Day 0, and the medium was replaced every 4 days. For preparation of cell lysates from the three-dimensional culture, the appropriate medium was replaced at Day 3, and cells were recovered and lysed at Day 4 as described below. Where indicated, U0126 (Promega Corp.) was added to cultures at the specified dose on Day 1, and the medium was replaced on Day 3. MCF-10A cells expressing the ecotropic retroviral receptor (MCF-10A/EcoR cells; a kind gift of Drs. Danielle Lynch and Joan Brugge) were grown and infected with retroviruses as described (30Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). In brief, the ecotropic packing cell line Phoenix-Eco was transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA using PolyFect (Qiagen Inc.). Retroviral supernatants were collected 48 h post-transfection, passed through a 0.22-μm filter, supplemented with Polybrene at a final concentration of 8 μg/ml, and diluted with fresh MCF-10A growth medium. This solution was then used to overlay a subconfluent culture of MCF-10A/EcoR cells, which were plated out at a density of 5 × 106 cells/10-cm dish on the day before infection. GFP-positive cells were then sorted to homogeneity by flow cytometry. Antibodies—Antibodies against phospho-Thr308 Akt, phospho-Ser473 Akt, total Akt, and phosphorylated and total p42/44 Erk and Stat5 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody 3F10 was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 and antibodies against β-catenin (clone 14) and E-cadherin (clone 36) were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies against the EGFR (528 or 1005) and Rb (C-15) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The anti-Gab2 (B-D39), anti-phospho-Rb (S780), anti-activated caspase-3, anti-β-actin (clone AC-15), and anti-Ki67 antibodies were purchased from Diaclone, Calbiochem, R&D systems, Sigma, and DakoCytomation, respectively. Analysis of Three-dimensional Matrigel Cultures by Bright-field and Confocal Microscopy—Acini were photographed, and their diameters were assessed using Leica Q500 MC QWin software (Version V01.02). For confocal microscopy, the acini were fixed and stained using the indicated antibodies as described (30Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). Following incubation with the primary antibodies, the acini were stained using the appropriate Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and TOPRO-3 or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as a DNA counterstain. Recovery of Acini from Three-dimensional Matrigel Cultures—After removal of the supernatant, the cultures were incubated in an appropriate volume of cell recovery solution (BD Biosciences) for 75 min at 4 °C to dissolve the Matrigel. Thereafter, acini were collected by centrifugation at 805 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Recovered acini or cells grown in monolayer culture were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 10 min on ice. Thereafter, the suspension was centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube and stored at -80 °C. For the immunoprecipitation of Gab2 signaling complexes, a subconfluent 10-cm dish of MCF-10A cells expressing the indicated Gab2 proteins was lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 15 min. Subsequently, immunoprecipitations were performed by adding 1 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody to 900 μl of post-nuclear supernatant containing 50 μl of recombinant protein G-Sepharose 4B slurry (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as described previously (31Brummer T. Elis W. Reth M. Huber M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 271: 189-212PubMed Google Scholar). Following overnight incubation, the immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Western Blot Analysis—This was performed as described previously (32Janes P.W. Daly R.J. deFazio A. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3601-3608PubMed Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Cells grown in monolayer culture or recovered acini were trypsinized at 37 °C for 12 min. Subsequently, the trypsin was inactivated by adding harvest medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum), and cells were collected by centrifugation at 805 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, cells were resuspended in harvest medium containing 62.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 3 h. 2 h before fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, RNase (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. All fluorescence-activated cell sorting data were acquired with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with CellQuest professional software. Analysis was performed with ModFit software. Densitometry—This was performed using IPLab Gel software (Signal Analytics Inc.). Statistical Analysis—This utilized a two-sided Student's t test, and differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. For statistical evaluation of more than two groups, analysis of variance was used. A Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch multiple comparison test was employed to compare every possible pair of means and to distinguish significantly different groups using SPSS software. Overexpression of Gab2 in the Immortalized Human Mammary Epithelial Cell Line MCF-10A—Prior to commencing our functional analysis of Gab2, it was important to determine whether the GAB2 gene is mutated in breast cancer cell lines, leading to expression of Gab2 proteins with enhanced transforming potential (e.g. Gab2 S159A (15Lynch D.K. Daly R.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). All of the nine coding exons and the corresponding intron-exon boundaries of the GAB2 gene were screened for mutations in 17 breast cancer cell lines; however, no changes affecting the Gab2 protein sequence were detected. Similarly, the GAB2 coding sequence in 12 ovarian and three prostate cancer cell lines was not altered (data not shown). Although this does not rule out the possibility of a low frequency of GAB2 mutations in primary breast cancers, these data led us to focus on the functional consequences of overexpressing the wild-type Gab2 protein in human mammary epithelial cells. In our original study, we determined that normal or immortalized human mammary epithelial cells express very low levels of endogenous Gab2, whereas a subset of breast cancer cell lines exhibits Gab2 expression that is at least an order of magnitude higher (19Daly R.J. Gu H. Parmar J. Malaney S. Lyons R.J. Kairouz R. Head D.R. Henshall S.M. Neel B.G. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5175-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, MCF-10A cells were not included in this analysis. Therefore, Western blotting was used to confirm that Gab2 expression in these cells was also low (Fig. 1A and data not shown). The cells were then infected with a bicistronic retrovirus encoding Gab2 and GFP from the same transcript and sorted according to their green fluorescence. This allowed the isolation of three pools expressing relatively low, medium, and high levels of Gab2 (Fig. 1A). These pools expressed levels of Gab2 that were 3-, 6-, and 18-fold higher, respectively, than those in the breast cancer cell line with the highest Gab2 expression, MDA-MB-468 (19Daly R.J. Gu H. Parmar J. Malaney S. Lyons R.J. Kairouz R. Head D.R. Henshall S.M. Neel B.G. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5175-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, the low expressing pool represented an appropriate model to study the biological consequences of Gab2 overexpression and was used for all of our analyses, unless indicated otherwise. Effects of Gab2 Overexpression on EGF-induced Signaling and Cell Cycle Progression in Monolayer Culture—EGF is an important mitogen for MCF-10A cells in culture (33Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined the effects of Gab2 overexpression on EGF-induced signaling events. Western blotting of cell lysates revealed reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of protein bands at ∼180 and 110 kDa and increased phosphorylation of a band at 95 kDa in MCF-10A/Gab2 cells compared with controls (Fig. 1B). Immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis identified the 180-kDa band as the EGFR (data not shown) and the 95-kDa band as Gab2 (see Fig. 4A), whereas the 110-kDa band remained uncharacterized. Because the total levels of the EGFR were unchanged (data not shown), reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor upon Gab2 overexpression is likely to reflect competition between phosphorylation sites on Gab2 and the EGFR C terminus. Furthermore, the activity of several downstream signaling pathways was enhanced in MCF-10A/Gab2 cells relative to controls. Phosphorylation of the PI3K effector Akt at the regulatory sites Thr308 and Ser473 was increased at both early and late time points (Fig. 1, B and C), whereas MCF-10A/Gab2 cells also exhibited more sustained Erk activation as indicated by increased levels of phospho-Erk at 15 and 45 min post-stimulation (Fig. 1, B and D). Finally, MCF-10A/Gab2 cells displayed a higher basal level of Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation. (In three independent experiments, there was a mean increase of 2.3-fold (p < 0.05).) This increased phosphorylation was maintained over 45 min of EGF stimulation. To further characterize the functional consequences of Gab2 overexpression, we investigated growth factor regulation of the cell cycle. EGF treatment of cells arrested in G1 phase by serum starvation led to a semisynchronous entry into S phase that was both more pronounced and more rapid for Gab2-overexpressing cells, so the percentage of cells in S phase peaked ∼3 h earlier than for vector controls (Fig. 2). EGF stimulation led to sustained proliferation of both control and Gab2-overexpressing cells, with respective doubling times of 35.5 and 27.0 h at 0.1 ng/ml EGF and 15.5 and 14.2 h at 10 ng/ml EGF. Therefore, the increased activation of mitogenic signaling pathways i"
https://openalex.org/W2065522875,"Thioredoxin binding protein-2 (TBP-2) is a negative regulator of thioredoxin and has multiple regulatory functions in cellular redox, growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and aging. To investigate the function of TBP-2 in vivo, we generated mice with targeted inactivation of TBP-2 (TBP-2-/- mice). Here, we show that TBP-2 expression is markedly up-regulated during fasting in wild-type mice, while TBP-2-/- mice were predisposed to death with bleeding tendency, as well as hepatic and renal dysfunction as a result of 48 h of fasting. The fasting-induced death was rescued by supplementation of glucose but not by that of oleic acid, suggesting that inability of fatty acid utilization plays an important role in the anomaly of TBP-2-/- mice. In these mice, plasma free fatty acids levels are higher, whereas glucose levels are lower than those of wild-type mice. Compared with wild-type mice, TBP-2-/- mice showed increased levels of plasma ketone bodies, pyruvate and lactate, indicating that Krebs cycle-mediated fatty acid utilization is impaired. Because the fatal impairment of fatty acid utilization is a characteristically metabolic feature of Reye (-like) syndrome, TBP-2-/- mouse may represent a novel model for investigating the pathophysiology of these disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2050289673,"Using a dual pipette assay that measures the force required to separate adherent cell doublets, we have quantitatively compared intercellular adhesiveness mediated by Type I (E- or N-cadherin) or Type II (cadherin-7 or -11) cadherins. At similar cadherin expression levels, cells expressing Type I cadherins adhered much more rapidly and strongly than cells expressing Type II cadherins. Using chimeric cadherins, we found that the extracellular domain exerts by far the dominant effect on cell adhesivity, that of E-cadherin conferring high adhesivity, and that of cadherin-7 conferring low adhesivity. Type I cadherins were incorporated to a greater extent into detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal complexes, and their cytoplasmic tails were much more effective in disrupting strong adherent junctions, suggesting that Type II cadherins form less stable complexes with β-catenin. The present study demonstrates compellingly, for the first time, that cadherins are dramatically different in their ability to promote intercellular adhesiveness, a finding that has profound implications for the regulation of tissue morphogenesis.

The present study demonstrates compellingly, for the first time, that cadherins are dramatically different in their ability to promote intercellular adhesiveness, a finding that has profound implications for the regulation of tissue morphogenesis. Adhesive interactions, so essential to multicellular life, are mediated by a diversity of cell surface receptors. Prominent among them are the cadherins, calcium-dependent adhesion molecules central to tissue development and morphogenesis (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 2Tepass U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 207-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The growing superfamily of cadherins is subdivided into five families: classical Type I cadherins, atypical Type II cadherins, desmosomal cadherins, protocadherins, and seven-pass transmembrane cadherins (4Yagi T. Takeichi M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1169-1180PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Classical Type I and desmosomal cadherins are found primarily in tissues where a high degree of cell cohesion is required for tissue integrity. Other types of cadherins are expressed in situations where cells are more motile, and intercellular interactions are more transitory (6Dufour S. Beauvais-Jouneau A. Delouvée A. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Pishavaian M.J. Feltes C.M. Thompson P. Bussemakers M.J. Schalken J.A. Byers S.W.

Neurosci. 1997; 9: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It is increasingly clear that cadherins contribute to other cellular functions, including cell signaling, proliferation, differentiation, segregation, and migration (10Chen H. Paradies N.E. Fedor-Chaiken M. Brackenbury R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 345-356PubMed Google Scholar, 11Murase S. Schuman E.M. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Predictably, the pattern of cadherin expression during development is complex. For example, development of the neural crest involves epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, cell migration, cell aggregation, and cell differentiation (18Le Douarin N.M. Kalcheim C. The Neural Crest. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1999Crossref Google Scholar), each of which is associated with tightly regulated, differential expression of Type I and II cadherins. Premigratory cells of the avian neural crest express first N-cadherin, and then they down-regulate N-cadherin and express Type II cadherin-6B, but later down-regulate it and induce expression of the Type II cadherin-7 as they migrate throughout the embryo (19Duband J.-L. Volberg T. Sabanay I. Thiery J.P. Geiger B. Development. 1988; 103: 325-344PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another Type II cadherin, cadherin-11, is similarly induced in migrating neural crest cells of rat and Xenopus embryos (21Simonneau L. Kitagawa M. Suzuki S. Thiery J.P. Cell Adhes. Comm. 1995; 3: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Vallin J. Thiery J.P. Broders F. Mech. Dev. 1998; 75: 183-186Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Borchers A. David R. Wedlich D. Development. 2001; 128: 3049-3060PubMed Google Scholar). Cell grafting experiments in vivo verify that expression of cadherin-7 correlates with cell dispersion and migration along migratory pathways, whereas that of N-cadherin fosters strong intercellular cohesivity and failure to migrate (6Dufour S. Beauvais-Jouneau A. Delouvée A. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Regulation of cellular adhesion can be achieved in a variety of ways (for review see Ref. 24Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The simplest, altering the number of cadherins on the cell surface, has been clearly shown to dictate the pattern of cell sorting in vitro (25Steinberg M.S. Takeichi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 26Friedlander D.R. Mege R.-M. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Changes in the cadherins expressed on cells during morphogenesis and under pathological conditions are also well documented (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 2Tepass U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 207-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Such differential expression would be even more effective if each cadherin promoted intercellular adhesion that is qualitatively or quantitatively unique. To test this possibility, we developed a dual pipette assay that quantifies precisely and reproducibly the force required to separate pairs of adherent cells (28Chu Y.S. Thomas W.A. Eder O. Pincet F. Perez E. Thiery J.P. Dufour S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 29Chu Y.S. Dufour S. Thiery J.P. Perez E. Pincet F. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2005; 94: 028102Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In earlier work we focused on E-cadherin that mediates rapid initial adhesion subsequently strengthened by cytoskeletal remodeling and nectin modulation (28Chu Y.S. Thomas W.A. Eder O. Pincet F. Perez E. Thiery J.P. Dufour S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 30Martinez-Rico C. Pincet F. Perez E. Thiery J.P. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Dufour S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4753-4760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we compare four different cadherins. The results indicate that Type I cadherins (E and N) promote much stronger adhesiveness than Type II cadherins (7 and 11), the difference being attributable primarily to the extracellular domain of the molecules. Antibodies and Reagents—NCD-2 and CCD7-1 mAbs 6The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; SF, separation force(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney. were a generous gift from M. Takeichi and S. Nakagawa (Kyoto University, Japan). The polyclonal antibody recognizing an epitope common to N- and E-cadherin and the ECCD-2 mAb were from Takara Biomedicals. mAb against cadherin-11 (clone 5B2H5) was obtained from Zymed Laboratories. ACAM and DECMA-1 mAb directed against N- and E-cadherin, respectively, were from Sigma. 7D6 mAb directed against chicken E-cadherin was from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. mAbs against α-catenin, β-catenin, or phosphorylated tyrosine (clone PY20) were from Transduction Laboratories. mAb against α-tubulin and secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were from Amersham Biosciences. Secondary antibodies coupled to Texas Red, Cy3, and fluorescein isothiocyanate were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Cell Lines and Stable Transfections—The Ecad and Ncad are S180 transfected clones expressing chicken E-cadherin and N-cadherin, respectively, and were previously described (6Dufour S. Beauvais-Jouneau A. Delouvée A. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Friedlander D.R. Mege R.-M. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7043-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The E14, E38, E41, and E58 clones, named according to their level of E-cadherin expression, were previously described by Chu et al. (28Chu Y.S. Thomas W.A. Eder O. Pincet F. Perez E. Thiery J.P. Dufour S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Clones with different levels of cadherin-7 or cadherin-11 were obtained by stable transfection of S180 cells with pMiwccad7 or pMiwmcad11, respectively (20Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kimura Y. Matsunami H. Inoue T. Shimamura K. Uchida N. Ueno T. Miyazaki T. Takeichi M. Dev.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of MDCK cells with constructs containing the cytoplasmic tails of cadherins were carried out using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Construction of Chimeric Cadherins and Cytoplasmic Tails of Cadherins Fused to GFP—pMiwNcad, pMiwcad7, and pBSSKcad7 were a generous gift from M. Takeichi. The pCE2 and pCE-Ecad plasmids were described by Boyer et al. (32Boyer B. Dufour S. Thiery J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We produced plasmids coding for chimeric EE7, E77, 7EE, and 77E cadherins (Fig. 1B), in which the extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of E-cadherin and cadherin-7 were exchanged, as described in supplemental Fig. S2. Constructs coding for GFP fused in frame with the cytoplasmic tails of N-cadherin and cadherin-7 (GFP-Ncadcyto and GFP-cad7cyto, respectively) were produced as indicated below. The list of primers used is shown in Fig. 1A. The cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin was amplified by PCR from pMiwcNcad using P16 and P17 primers. Amplification of the cadherin-7 cytoplasmic domain was performed from pMiwcad7 using P18 and P19 primers. The corresponding inserts were digested with either BglII and XbaI or BglII and BamHI and subcloned into pEGFPC1 (Clontech). The integrity of each construct was verified by analysis of the DNA sequence. Cell Dissociation and Aggregation Assays—The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, and confluent cultures were routinely passaged by treatment with 0.05% trypsin + 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. For separation force (SF) measurements and cell aggregation assay, cell dissociation was performed in TC buffer (0.01% trypsin + 10 mm calcium) (20Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to SF measurements, the cells were resuspended in working medium (CO2-independent medium; Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and used immediately. Pre-existing doublets (doublets never disrupted by the dissociation procedure used to prepare cell suspensions) were allowed to sit for one additional hour in the assay dish before use to be certain that they were not mitotic pairs. Cadherin-dependent aggregation assays were performed as described elsewhere (6Dufour S. Beauvais-Jouneau A. Delouvée A. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Extracts and Immunoblotting—Extraction of cell monolayers and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (6Dufour S. Beauvais-Jouneau A. Delouvée A. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with a mixture of antibodies directed against β-catenin and α-tubulin or cadherin, followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative analysis was done by the ImageQuant program on a representative Western blot from three independent experiments. The α-tubulin content was used to normalize for the protein level of each lane. The levels of β-catenin and E-cadherin of Ecad cells were taken as the 100% standard for comparison with all other transfected clones. For Western blot analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, the cell extracts were prepared in the presence of 100 μm sodium orthovanadate. Analysis of cadherin distribution between the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions was carried out as described by Bauer et al. (33Bauer A. Lickert H. Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28314-28321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell monolayers were extracted using CSK buffer to obtain the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. Identical volumes of the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis as described above with cadherin-specific antibodies. Metabolic labeling of cells was performed by an overnight incubation of subconfluent monolayers with 250 μCi of [35S]methionine (in vivo labeling grade; Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation of catenins with cadherins were performed as previously described (34Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis was done using the ImageQuant program on a representative autoradiograph displaying the results from three independent experiments. The methionine content was taken into account to normalize the band intensity calculated for each cadherin. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunodetection of cadherins in cultured cells was performed as previously described (6Dufour S. Beauvais-Jouneau A. Delouvée A. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cells were viewed by epifluorescence using a Leica DMRBE microscope and a cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu C5985). Image acquisitions were controlled by a Power Macintosh work station operating IP-Lab software. Cadherin expression was analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described (28Chu Y.S. Thomas W.A. Eder O. Pincet F. Perez E. Thiery J.P. Dufour S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Measurement of Separation Forces between Cells—The micromanipulation technique was previously described in detail by Chu et al. (28Chu Y.S. Thomas W.A. Eder O. Pincet F. Perez E. Thiery J.P. Dufour S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 29Chu Y.S. Dufour S. Thiery J.P. Perez E. Pincet F. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2005; 94: 028102Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, SF were measured on the heating stage of a Leica inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled CCD Hamamatsu C5985 or Nikon Coolpix 5000 camera. Image acquisition was controlled by a Power Macintosh work station operating IP-Lab software. Two cells were gently aspirated, one on the tip of each pipette, and were brought into contact for a designated period of time through the use of micromanipulators. At the end of the designated time, the pipettes were moved apart in an effort to detach the adherent cells from one another. A doublet pulled intact from the left pipette was moved back to the orifice of that pipette, where the aspiration was then increased. The cycle was repeated with discrete increments in aspiration, the magnitudes of which were measured with a pressure sensor (Validyne; model DP103-38; 0-50000 Pa), until the level reached in the left pipette was sufficient to pull the doublet apart. Aspiration values recorded for each of the last two cycles in the series (Pn-1 and Pn) were used to calculate the SF for each doublet using the equation: SF = π(d/2) 2These authors contributed equally to this work. (Pn-1 + Pn)/2 where d is the internal diameter of left pipette. The results for 30-50 measurements were used to obtain the mean SF for a specific contact time in at least three independent experiments. The mean SF is referred to as the SF values indicated in the figures presented. Cadherin and β-Catenin Expression in Transfected Cells—Parental S180 cells do not express detectable levels of cadherins or β-catenin and exhibit minimal cell-cell adhesion in tissue culture (6Dufour S. Beauvais-Jouneau A. Delouvée A. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Friedlander D.R. Mege R.-M. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7043-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). S180 cells stably transfected to express E-cadherin (Ecad cells), N-cadherin (Ncad cells), cadherin-11 (cad11 cells), or cadherin-7 (cad7 cells) formed characteristic intercellular adhesions in tissue culture with the respective cadherin and β-catenin (Fig. 2, A-H) localized at cell-cell contacts. Several transfected clones expressing varying levels of E-cadherin (Fig. 2, I and M), cadherin-7 (Fig. 2, J and M), or cadherin-11 (Fig. 2, K and M) were compared for their cadherin and β-catenin contents. The highest expressor clones for cadherin-11 and cadherin-7 (cad11-cl14 and cad7-cl29, respectively) were selected for further analysis and referred to simply as cad11 and cad7 cells. The cell lines were analyzed by Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against a common epitope in cadherin cytoplasmic domain. Ncad cells and three E-cadherin clones, E58, E41, and E38 (28Chu Y.S. Thomas W.A. Eder O. Pincet F. Perez E. Thiery J.P. Dufour S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), expressed 115, 58, 41, and 38%, respectively, of the 100% Ecad reference (Fig. 2, L and M). Type II cadherins could not be quantified with this because of a lack of the common epitope. However, the level of β-catenin expression was proportional to that of cadherin in all the clones (Fig. 2, K-M, and data not shown). Moreover, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and cadherin-7 co-precipitated at a comparable level with β- and α-catenin (Fig. 3). β-Catenin expression was therefore used to estimate the cadherin content in Type I and Type II cadherin-expressing clones. E- and N-cadherin and cadherin-7 are not removed from the cell surface by TC treatment (see “Materials and Methods”) as shown by FACS (Figs. 2, I and J, and 4A). The lack of an appropriate antibody prevented comparable visualization of cadherin-11 at the surface of TC-treated cad11 cells. However, cad11 cells, like Ecad, Ncad, and cad7 cells, formed aggregates in short term gyratory aggregation assays (supplementary Fig. S1), implying that cadherin-11, like the other cadherins, is present and functional after TC treatment. FACS analysis showed that Ecad, Ncad, and cad7 cells expressed high levels of cadherin at their surfaces (Fig. 4A). The mean intensity values for the FACS profile peaks were 71.19, 72.21, and 51.39 for Ecad, Ncad and cad7 cells, respectively. Thus, Ecad and Ncad cells expressed similar levels of cadherin at their surface, and cad7 cells expressed 72% of the Ecad level (taken as the 100% reference level). These results correlate with the percentage of cadherin evaluated from the Western blot analyses (Fig. 2, L-M) of cell extracts. They were also in agreement with the fact that cadherins are mostly located at the surfaces of cell monolayers, as shown in Fig. 2 (A-H). Kinetics of the SF Measured for Different Cadherin-expressing Cells—Using our dual pipette assay, we first determined the time course of SF for cells expressing the four different cadherins. We had previously observed that Ecad cells adhere rapidly and then strengthen their adhesion with time of contact (Ref. 28Chu Y.S. Thomas W.A. Eder O. Pincet F. Perez E. Thiery J.P. Dufour S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar and Fig. 4B). Ncad cells (Fig. 4C) showed nearly identical kinetics but with lower overall adhesivity. After 4 and 30 min of contact, we measured a mean SF of 8 and 73 nanonewtons (nN), respectively, for Ncad doublets compared with 52 and 180 nN, respectively, for Ecad doublets. Adhesions between cells expressing Type II cadherins formed much more slowly and were very weak. Cad7 adhesion displayed kinetics seemingly similar to those of Type I cadherins, but on axes with very different scales (Fig. 4D). A SF of 17 nN developed after 60 min of contact was comparable with values for Ecad cells (20 nN) and Ncad cells (27 nN) developed after only 30 s and 8 min of contact, respectively. The results for Cad11 cells were even more striking; they displayed no measurable SF for contact times of less than 30 min (not shown). The cad11 doublets were so susceptible to vibrations that SF measurements were impractical at early times. The SF of 3.5 and 7.4 nN measured at 30 and 60 min, respectively, were far below those obtained even for cad7 cells. Measurement of SF in Long Term Adherent Doublets—The maximal SF was determined using doublets never disrupted by the TC dissociation procedure (pre-existing doublets). In every case, the SF for preexisting doublets was significantly higher than that obtained for doublets formed after 60 min of contact (Fig. 4E). For cells expressing Type I cadherins, the SF for pre-existing doublets were much more similar (SF Ncad/SF Ecad = 0.86) than those of 60-min doublets (SF Ncad/SF Ecad = 0.40). SF for pre-existing doublets expressing Type II cadherins (cadherin-7 or cadherin-11) were much weaker than those of Type I cadherins (about 50 nN) and were indistinguishable from those of preexisting doublets of parental S180 cells lacking cadherins. Fixed Time Point Comparison of SF for Cells Expressing Different Cadherins—A fixed time point comparison of cells expressing different cadherins yielded corroborating results (Table 1). The SF at 30 min for Ecad doublets (194 nN) was much greater than that obtained for Ncad doublets (74 nN), even though cadherin expression in the latter was ∼115% that in the former. Similar results were obtained with a second, comparable N-cadherin expressing clone (not shown).TABLE 1Comparison between the mean SF measured for 30-min doublets expressing different cadherinsCellsEstimated cadherin contentSF at 30 min%nNNcad11574.9 ± 7.8Cad7798.8 ± 0.9Cad11393.5 ± 0.5Ecad100194.1 ± 14.9E585853.4 ± 1.3E383819.9 ± 2.4E14148.5 ± 1.4 Open table in a new tab The difference between Type I and Type II cadherins was even more dramatic. Although cad7 and cad11 cells expressed cadherin at 79 and 39% of the Ecad reference level, they exhibited SF of only 8.8 and 3.5 nN, respectively. These values were either comparable with or less than those measured for the E14 clone expressing the lowest level (14%; 8.5 nN) of Type I E-cadherin. Incorporation of Cadherins into Junctional Complexes—We next investigated the subcellular distribution of cadherins by analyzing detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions extracted from confluent monolayers of Ecad, Ncad, and cad7 cells. All three cadherins were found in both fractions (Fig. 5A), but their distribution between the two fractions varied considerably with the type of cadherin: 34 and 33% of the E- and N-cadherin, respectively, but only about 6% of cadherin 7, was found in the detergent-insoluble fraction of the corresponding cell extracts. The results for cadherin-11 were similar to those for cadherin-7 (not shown). Post-extraction immunolabeling of cells with anti-β-catenin revealed that cell-cell junctions of Ncad cells were much more resistant to detergent treatment than those of cad7 cells. The majority of junctional staining remained in Ncad cells after detergent treatment (Fig. 5, B and D), whereas most staining was lost in cad7 cells (Fig. 5, C and E). These results suggest that Type II cadherin-7 is incorporated much less readily than Type I E- or N-cadherin into the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton complex. E-cadherin, N-cadherin and cadherin-7 co-precipitated with β- and α-catenin (Fig. 3). Tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin is known to modulate cadherin function (35Balsamo J. Leung T. Ernst H. Zanin M.K. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 36Roura S. Miravet S. Piedra J. Garcia de Herreros A. Dunach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36734-36740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), but Ecad, cad7, and Ncad cells displayed similar levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated β-catenin (Fig. 5F), suggesting that the reduced adhesiveness of cad7 cells does not involve changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin. Transient expression of Type I cadherin cytoplasmic tails can disrupt adherent junctions in highly cohesive cells and interfere with β-catenin localization (37Simcha I. Kirkpatrick C. Sadot E. Shtutman M. Polevoy G. Geiger B. Peifer M. Ben-Ze'ev A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1177-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have therefore compared the ability of the cytoplasmic domain of the different cadherins to affect intercellular adhesion. Constructs containing GFP fused to the cytoplasmic tails of each cadherin were transiently expressed in MDCK cells, and their effect on the organization of adherens junctions was determined (Fig. 5, G and J). Expression of a Type I cadherin tail (E- or N-) resulted in an increased cytoplasmic pool of β-catenin and a significant decrease in the localization of β-catenin at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 5, G and H, arrows, and Ref. 37Simcha I. Kirkpatrick C. Sadot E. Shtutman M. Polevoy G. Geiger B. Peifer M. Ben-Ze'ev A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1177-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Of the 110 cells examined, more than 90% displayed accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, and at least 55% showed much reduced staining for β-catenin at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 5J). By contrast, expression of the Type II cadherin-7 cytoplasmic tail affected neither junctional organization nor β-catenin distribution. β-Catenin was localized at cell-cell contacts in more than 70% of the cells (Fig. 5I), and only about 50% of them displayed accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5J). SF Measurements on Cell Doublets Expressing Chimeric Cadherins—We constructed expression vectors coding for chimeric cadherins where the extracellular, transmembrane or cytoplasmic domain were exchanged between E-cadherin (prototypical Type I cadherin) and cadherin-7 (prototypical Type II cadherin). These two cadherins were chosen because they fostered the greatest measurable difference in SF in our assay. Stably transfected S180 cells expressing EE7, E77, 77E, or 7EE chimeric cadherins (Figs. 6 and 7) were selected and compared with clones producing either wild type E-cadherin (EEE) at different levels or cadherin-7 (777) (Table 1).FIGURE 7Characterization of clones expressing 77E and 7EE chimeric cadherins and determination of their SF.

We have therefore determined the role of oligomerization of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4. A series of glutathione S-transferase-syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 chimeric proteins showed that all syndecan constructs containing the transmembrane domain formed SDS-resistant dimers, but not those lacking it. SDS-resistant dimer formation was hardly seen in the syndecan chimeras where each transmembrane domain was substituted with that of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Increased MAPK activity was detected in HEK293T cells transfected with syndecan/PDGFR chimeras in a syndecan transmembrane domain-dependent fashion. The chimera-induced MAPK activation was independent of both ligand and extracellular domain, implying that the transmembrane domain is sufficient to induce dimerization/oligomerization in vivo. Furthermore, the syndecan chimeras were defective in syndecan-4-mediated focal adhesion formation and protein kinase Cα activation or in syndecan-2mediated cell migration. Taken together, these data suggest that the transmembrane domains are sufficient for inducing dimerization and that transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization is crucial for syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 functions.

Taken together, these data suggest that the transmembrane domains are sufficient for inducing dimerization and that transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization is crucial for syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 functions. The syndecans are a major family of transmembrane cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans that are developmentally regulated with tissue-specific distributions (1Kim C. Goldberger O. Gallo R.

Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Syndecan-2 is abundantly expressed in mesenchymal cells, whereas syndecan-1 and syndecan-3 are characteristic of epithelial and neuronal cells (2Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 620-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). All syndecans are type I transmembrane receptor proteins, with an N-terminal signal peptide, an ectodomain containing several consensus sequences for glycosaminoglycan attachment, a putative protease cleavage site proximal to the membrane, a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (2Bernfield M.

Their extracellular domain sequences are very distinct, but transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain sequences are highly conserved (2Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), implying a possible biological role for the cytoplasmic domain. Indeed, during cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interaction, syndecans have important roles as cell surface receptors (6Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 7Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8Simons M. Horowitz A. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is common that signaling through cell surface receptor proteins containing a single transmembrane domain is transduced by noncovalent dimerization of the proteins in response to ligand binding (9Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 10Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). In the case of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) 3The abbreviations used are: PDGFplatelet-derived growth factorPDGFRplatelet derived growth factor receptorErkextracellular signal-regulated kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateMAPKmitogen-activate protein kinasePBSphosphate-buffered salinePKCαprotein kinase CαREFrat embryo fibroblast. receptor (PDGFR), ligand stimulation of the PDGFR leads to receptor dimerization, activation of the kinase activity of the receptor, and phosphorylation of the receptor at numerous intracellular tyrosine residues. Subsequently, various molecules containing Src homology domains are recruited to the PDGFR where they act as signaling enzymes and adapter molecules (11Schlesinger T.K. Demali K.A. Johnson G.L.

The possible participation of syndecans in signaling was first suggested by the findings that syndecan-4 is a component of focal adhesions (13Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), where extracellular matrix-induced signal transduction takes place (6Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 7Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8Simons M. Horowitz A. Cell.

When plated on fibronectin, syndecan-4 on the cell surface becomes clustered, and the clustered syndecan-4 interacts with both protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to further transduce downstream signals for focal adhesion and stress fiber formation (14Oh E.S.

Like growth factor receptors, oligomerization is probably a major step for syndecan-4-mediated signal transduction (6Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 7Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8Simons M. Horowitz A. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, the oligomerization status of syndecan-4 is a key important issue, but many of details remain unknown. Several lines of evidence clearly show that the syndecan family has a propensity to oligomerize. All members of this family form homologous dimers or multimers that are resistant to treatment with SDS (2Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 19Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have shown that recombinant syndecan-3 core protein forms stable, noncovalent multimer complexes, and this property requires the presence of the transmembrane domain and a short sequence in the ectodomain flanking region. Similarly, recombinant syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 core proteins form SDS-resistant oligomers even in the complete absence of the cytoplasmic domain (14Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), implying that the cytoplasmic domains of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 are not essential for basal oligomerization. All of these studies indicate the importance of the transmembrane domain for syndecan dimerization. However, the relationship between dimerization and function is unclear. In this study we demonstrate that the transmembrane domains are sufficient for SDS-resistant dimerization in vitro and functional dimer formation in vivo and that transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization is crucial for functions of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4.

Rat embryo fibroblast (REF) cells were maintained in α-modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. For treatment with PDGF, HEK293T cells were starved for 12 h in serum-free media (SFM), and 50 ng/ml PDGF was then added for 15 min. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-Syndecan-2 and GST-Syndecan-4 Core Proteins—Sydnecan-2 and syndecan-4 cDNAs encoding full-length (2W, 4W), the extracellular and the transmembrane domain (2ET, 4ET), the extracellular domain (2E, 4E), the transmembrane domain (2T, 4T), the cytoplasmic domain (2C, 4C), and the transmembrane domain containing four flanking extracellular amino acid residue (KRTE, ERTE; single letter amino acid codes) in the extracellular domain either in the absence (2eT, 4eT) or presence (2eTC, 4eTC) of the cytoplasmic domain were synthesized by PCR and subcloned into GST expression vector pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed mutations were generated by PCR amplification (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Introduction of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the plasmids. TABLE ONE lists the oligonucleotides that were used as PCR primers for cloning, and the TABLE ONE legend explains the oligonucleotide names (such as 4W, 2W, etc.) that are used here and throughout. These constructs were used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α, and the expressions of fusion proteins, the GST-syndecan mutants, were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 7 h.

The LET/PC chimera was constructed by linking the extracellular domain and transmembrane domain (amino acids 1–27) of LAT (linker for activation of T cells) and the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 557–1107) of PDGFR. The PE/4T/PC chimera was constructed by linking the extracellular domain (amino acids 1–531) of PDGFR, the transmembrane domain (amino acids 150–174) of syndecan-4, and the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 557–1107) of PDGFR. The chimeras, and full-length syndecan-2/syndecan-4 constructs were inserted into the HA tagging pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells (6 × 105) were plated on 6-cm-diameter culture dishes, incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and then cotransfected with 1 μg of either 2ET/PC, 4ET/PC, LET/PC, PE/4T/PC, 2W, 4W, or HA-pcDNA3 cDNAs and 1 μg of HA-Erk1 cDNA in Effectene reagents (Qiagen). REFs were transfected with either 4W or 4E/PT/4C using Effectene reagents, and these cells were selected by G418 (500 μg/ml) for 3 weeks. RIE1 cells were transfected with either 2W or 2E/PT/2C using PolyFect reagents (Qiagen). Lysate Preparation and Immunoblotting—After cultures were washed twice with PBS, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 2 mm Na3VO4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, denatured with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with appropriate antibodies, followed by species-specific, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Cell Adhesion Assay—35-mm bacteria culture plates were coated with either 20 μg/ml syndecan-2 or syndecan-4 antibody in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Each antibody-coated plate was washed with PBS, blocked with 0.2% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed again with PBS (3 × 5 min). HEK293T cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin suspended in serum-free media containing 0.25 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and centrifuged. Cells were resuspended in 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, plated on the coated plates, and incubated at 37 °C. Microscopic Analysis—Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at a density of 4 × 104 cells, incubated for 24 h, and then fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. After rinsing three times with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% gelatin in PBS for 1 h. After being washed, cells were stained with the specific antibodies. Images were obtained by digital imaging florescence microscopy using a charge-coupled device camera (Carl Zeiss). In Vitro PKC Activity Assay—The standard reaction mixture (total 20 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 3 mm magnesium acetate, PKCα (Upstate Biotechnology), and 1 μg of 50 mm HEPES histone III-S as a substrate. PIP2 (50 μm) and 4W, 4E/PT/4C, 4TC, and PT/4C (0.25 mg/ml) were added as indicated. Reactions were started by the addition of 200 mm ATP (0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). After incubation at 25 °C for 5 min, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and phosphorylated histone III-S was detected by autoradiograph and quantified by Image Reader BAS-2500 (Fujifilm) imaging densitometer. GST Pull Down Assays—Recombinant GST-syndecan-4 proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (14Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 15Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.T. Theibert A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10624-10629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Proteins bound on the bead were washed three times with lysis buffer and mixed with either REF cell lysate (Fig. 6C) or purified PKCα (20Inagaki M. Watanabe M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2922-2925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6D). After incubation at 4 °C on a rotator for 2 h, the precipitated complex was eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the specific antibody. Migration Assay—Gelatin (1 μg/μl in PBS) was added to each well of a Transwell plate (8-μm pore size; Costar, Cambridge, MA), and the membranes were allowed to dry for 1 h at room temperature. The Transwells were assembled in a 24-well plate, and the lower chambers were filled with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells (3 × 104) were added to each upper chamber, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 16 h. Cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filters were stained with 0.6% hematoxylin and 0.5% eosin and counted. Transmembrane Domains Are Essential for SDS-resistant Dimerization of Syndecan-2 and Syndecan-4 Core Proteins—Several recombinant syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 constructs were expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1A) that were purified using glutathione-agarose beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE following Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 1, B and C). Consistent with the previous reports (14Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), recombinant full-length syndecan-4 core protein (GST-4W) resolved as SDS-resistant dimers. In addition, five different mutants (4ET, 4eTC, 4TC, 4eT, and 4T) that contained the transmembrane domain showed SDS-resistant dimer formation. On the other hand, neither the cytoplasmic domain (4C) nor the extracellular domain alone (4E) showed SDS-resistant dimerization. Syndecan-2 core proteins showed closely similar results to those of syndecan-4 (Fig. 1C). Therefore, it seems that the transmembrane domain is important for SDS-resistant dimerization of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4. Similar to syndecan-3 (19Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), replacement of conserved glycine residues in the transmembrane domain with leucine residues (Gly → Leu) abolished SDS-resistant dimer formation of both syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 (Fig. 2), supporting the notion that the transmembrane domain is crucial for SDS-resistant dimerization of both syndecan-2 and syndecan-4.FIGURE 2Transmembrane mutants fail to form SDS-resistant dimerization of syndecan-4 and syndecan-2. A, syndecan amino acid sequences of the transmembrane (TM) with four amino acid residues (ERTE, KRTE) in the membrane flanking region are shown. Two of the conserved glycine residues indicated by closed circles were replaced by leucine residues, as indicated by the arrows. B and C, both total cell lysates (TCL) and purified recombinant syndecan or its mutant (Gly → Leu) were separated by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. Migration positions of SDS-resistant dimer (••) and monomer (•) are indicated. IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate the function of the transmembrane domain, each transmembrane domain of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 was replaced with the transmembrane domain of PDGFR that contains a single transmembrane domain and forms noncovalent dimers in response to ligand binding (9Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 10Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Consistently, GST-4W and GST-2W showed a strong SDS-resistant dimer formation that was hardly seen in 4E/PT/4C (Fig. 3A) and 2E/PT/2C (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, mutants PE/4T and PE/4TC, which contained the transmembrane domain of syndecan but not that of PDGFR, showed SDS-resistant dimer formation (Fig. 3C). Therefore, these data strongly suggest that the transmembrane domain is sufficient for inducing SDS-resistant dimerization of both syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 core proteins. Transmembrane Domains Are Sufficient for Inducing Dimer Formation of Chimeric Proteins in Vivo—Additional syndecan chimeras (4ET/PC and 2ET/PC) were constructed that consisted of the extracellular domain and transmembrane domain of each syndecan and the cytoplasmic domain of PDGFR. Either 4ET/PC or 2ET/PC chimera cDNA was cotransfected with Erk1 cDNA into HEK293T cells, and chimera-induced MAPK activation was analyzed. Because it is well known that dimerization of PDGFR cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to activate MAPK activity (11Schlesinger T.K. Demali K.A. Johnson G.L. Kazlauskas A. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12DeMali K.A. Balciunaite E. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19551-19558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), MAPK activation indicates dimerization of these chimeras. Western blotting with anti-phospho-Erk antibody showed that MAPK activation in chimera-transfected cells was increased compared with that in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4A, bottom section) together with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (Fig. 4A, top section). In contrast, transfection of wild type syndecan-4, wild type syndecan-2, or the syndecan-4 chimera with Gly to Leu substitution in the transmembrane domain cDNAs did not affect MAPK activity (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, there was no significant difference in MAPK activation between 4ET/PC and 2ET/PC (Fig. 4B), implying that both transmembrane domains similarly induce dimerization of chimeras. Because overexpression of the PDGFR cytoplasmic domain per se might affect chimera-induced MAPK activation, LET/PC was constructed that consisted of the extracellular domain and transmembrane domain of LAT, which has not been known to form oligomers (21Wonerow P. Watson S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6273-6283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Tomlinson M.G. Lin J. Weiss A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 584-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the cytoplasmic domain of PDGFR (Fig. 4C). Overexpression of LET/PC did not significantly affect MAPK activity, implying that transmembrane domain induced dimerization is crucial for chimera-induced MAPK activation. Therefore, it is likely that transmembrane domain is sufficient for inducing the dimer of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 in vivo. Transmembrane Domain-induced Dimerization Is Independent of the Extracellular Domain—Because it is known that engagement of syndecan through its extracellular domain induces oligomerization, we investigated the effect of the extracellular domain on chimera-induced dimerization. Vector and chimera (4ET/PC)-transfected cells were plated on either syndecan-2 or syndecan-4 antibody-coated plates to induce clustering of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 extracellular domains. However, chimera-induced MAPK activities were not affected by engagement of the extracellular domain with the specific antibodies (Fig. 5A). We then made a PDGFR chimera where its transmembrane domain was substituted with that of syndecan-4 (PE/4T/PC) (Fig. 5, B and C). Transfection of this chimera in HEK293T cells showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of this PDGFR chimera (Fig. 5B, top section) and MAPK activity (Fig. 5B, bottom section). This chimera-induced MAPK activation was independent on treatment of 50 ng/ml PDGF (Fig. 5C). Thus, it is likely that the transmembrane domain of syndecan-induced dimerization is not affected by the extracellular domain. These results strongly suggest that both syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 form dimers in vivo mediated by their transmembrane domains alone. Transmembrane Domain-induced Oligomerization Is Crucial for Syndecan Functions—We next investigated the functionality of transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization. Because syndecan-4 plays an important role in focal adhesion formation, we analyzed the effect of the altered oligomerization on focal adhesion formation. REF cells transfected with the cDNAs of either 4W or 4E/PT/4C were plated on fibronectin, and the focal adhesions were highlighted by indirect immunofluorescence using vinculin or paxillin antibodies. Consistent with previous reports (23Longley R. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Echtermeyer F. Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Ge Y. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3433-3441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increased focal adhesion formation was observed in 4W-transfected cells as compared with vector-transfected cells. In contrast, expression of an oligomerization mutant 4E/PT/4C slightly decreased focal adhesion formation (Fig. 6A). Exogenously expressed 4W, but not 4E/PT/4C, was retained in the Triton X-100-resistant cytoskeleton (25Greene D.K. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7617-7623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), implying that the susceptibility of Triton X-100 extraction was significantly increased in the oligomerization mutant (Fig. 6B) and that the interaction with syntenin (26Grootjans J.J.

Ceulemans H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19933-19941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was evidently decreased in 4E/PT/4C (Fig. 6C). Previous work has shown that, in combination with PIP2, syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain can interact and strongly activate PKCα (14Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 16Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15871-15877Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the syndecan-4 oligomerization mutant 4E/PT/4C showed reduced interaction with PKCα (Fig. 6D), and 4E/PT/4C, PT/4C, and 4Gly → Leu promoted much less in vitro PKCα activity (Fig. 6E). The functions of syndecan-2 were also affected by transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization. RIE1 cells transfected with the cDNAs of 2W, but not 2E/PT/2C, showed increased cell migration compared with control cells (Fig. 7A). Similar to 4E/PT/4C, the interaction with syntenin was decreased in 2E/PT/2C (Fig. 7B). Taken together, all these data strongly suggest that transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization is crucial for the functions of both syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 in vivo. Syndecan core proteins are known to have propensity to form non-covalently linked dimers (2Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 5Rapraeger A.C. Ott V.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 620-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 19Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). High sequence homology and a previous study with syndecan-3 have suggested that both the transmembrane domain and the four amino acid residues in the ectodomain flanking region are important for dimerization of syndecan core proteins. In this study, we have further investigated the importance of each syndecan domain for functional dimerization. Consistent with previous results (14Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 19Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), recombinant full-length core proteins of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 (GST-4W and GST-2W) showed a strong SDS-resistant dimer formation (Figs. 1, 2, 3) that was hardly seen in 4E/PT/4C (Fig. 3A) and 2E/PT/2C (Fig. 3B). Replacement of the conserved glycine residues in the transmembrane domain with leucine residues also abolished SDS-resistant dimer formation of recombinant syndecan core proteins (Fig. 2), supporting the notion that the transmembrane domain is crucial for SDS-resistant dimerization of both syndecan-2 and syndecan-4. However, unlike syndecan-3, where mutation of any of the four amino acid residues (ERKE) in the ectodomain immediately external to the transmembrane domain decreased the extent of dimer formation (19Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), deletion of all four amino acid residues does not decrease SDS-resistant dimer formation of either syndecan-2 or syndecan-4 core proteins (Fig. 1). Clearly, the ectodomains do not promote SDS-resistant dimerization of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 and seem not to be required. It is clear that syndecans form dimers and the transmembrane domains are crucial for SDS-resistant dimerization of both syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 in vitro. However, there is no direct evidence showing transmembrane domain-induced dimer formation of syndecans in vivo. To define functional dimerization of syndecan core protein in cells, several syndecan-PDGFR chimeras have been used. This receptor has been chosen because its activation is dependent on receptor dimerization and its signaling can be readily analyzed by MAPK activation. Transfection studies with syndecan-PDGFR chimeras clearly show that the transmembrane domains of both syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 are able to induce dimerization of these chimeras, resulting in constitutive MAPK activation (Fig. 4 and 5). Similarly to SDS-resistant dimerization of recombinant core proteins, the extracellular domain is not involved in dimerization of syndecan-PDGFR chimera, as shown by the following three findings. 1) Antibody-induced oligomerization of syndecan extracellular domain did not affect chimera-induced MAPK activation (Fig. 5A). 2) Chimera-induced MAPK activation was similarly increased in suspended cells (data not shown). 3) PDGFR chimeras containing the transmembrane domain of syndecan-4 by itself induced MAPK activation independently of PDGF treatment (Fig. 5C). It is believed that growth factor receptors form dimers in a ligand-dependent manner. However, the chimeras containing the transmembrane domain of either sydecan-2 or sydecan-4 likely form constitutive dimers, based on MAPK activation and electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 4 and 5). This result confirms the hypothesis that dimerization of PDGFR is PDGF-dependent and sufficient for PDGF-mediated MAPK activation. However, it is not the case in syndecan-mediated cell spreading. Because syndecan-4 has a strong tendency for higher order oligomerization (6Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 19Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Oh E.S. Couchman J.R. Mol Cells. 2004; 17: 181-187PubMed Google Scholar), both syndecan-2 and sydecan-4 may form constitutive dimers that, after plating on the extracellular matrix, form higher order oligomers. Because syndecan-4 can become a high order oligomer both in vivo and in vitro, we could not exclude the possibility that the chimeric proteins described here might also form higher order oligomers. Under our experimental conditions, MAPK activity only reflects dimerization but not higher order oligomerization. Therefore, we cannot discriminate whether the transmembrane domain induces dimerization or higher order oligomerization of syndecan core protein in vivo. In addition, although neither the extracellular domain nor the cytoplasmic domain promotes SDS-resistant dimerization of syndecans, it may be possible that both domains regulate higher order oligomerization of syndecan core protein in vivo. Syndecan-4 acts as a coreceptor with integrins in focal adhesion formation (6Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 7Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), but oligomerization mutants failed to enhance focal adhesion formation (Fig. 6A), reside in the Triton X-100-resistant cytoskeleton (Fig. 6B), interact with PKCα (Fig. 6D), or efficiently activate PKCα in vitro (Fig. 6E). This implies that transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization may control the biological activity of the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain. The syndecan-2 oligomerization mutant was also unable to regulate cell migration (Fig. 7). Therefore, it seems that the transmembrane domain is crucial for inducing functional oligomerization of the syndecan-2 and sydecan-4 core proteins. This is the first evidence to show the functionality of the transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization in vivo. One of the most important observations in this study is the apparent specificity of the transmembrane domain. The functionality of the transmembrane domain is more significant when contrasted with growth factor receptor-mediated signal transduction. During transmembrane signaling, extracellular ligands bind to specific receptors on the cell surface, and the binding subsequently alters their oligomeric status to evoke a signal cascade inside the cell (9Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 10Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). A variety of studies have shown that the activation of downstream signaling is dependent on the oligomeric status of the cytoplasmic domain. However, although it plays a major role in controlling oligomeric status of the cytoplasmic domain in the case of syndecans, the transmembrane domain has received relatively little attention. It is clear that oligomerization of the cytoplasmic domain of receptor is a different issue from that of whole receptor protein, where the transmembrane domains are a key driver of oligomerization. Thus, the transmembrane domain inevitably regulates the activity of the cytoplasmic domain and is crucial for receptor functions. How does the transmembrane domain regulate the cytoplasmic domain? Is it only by inducing oligomerization? Transmembrane domains of both PDGFR and syndecan are able to induce oligomerization of the receptor protein in vivo, although the ligand dependence may be different for the two. The important point is that they both have the potential to do so and that their oligomerization is crucial for activating signaling cascades. Interestingly, however, the unique nature of syndecan function is that the specific activity of syndecan requires the presence of syndecan but not of the PDGFR transmembrane domain. This is demonstrated by the syndecan/PDGFR chimeras where each syndecan transmembrane domain was substituted with that of PDGFR, which showed a clear defect in most of syndecan functions tested (Figs. 6 and 7). This implies that transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization is not just for aggregating the receptors. It may induce a quaternary structure of the cytoplasmic domain, whose overall structure is required for the specific function of each receptor protein. Therefore, syndecan transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization plays a syndecan-specific role in regulating the functions of syndecan that cannot be replaced by other transmembrane oligomerization domains. It remains unclear whether this is a general phenomenon of homo-oligomerization of receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2023003671,"Retrograde (RTG) signaling senses mitochondrial dysfunction and initiates readjustments of carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism through nuclear accumulation of the heterodimeric transcription factors, Rtg1/3p. The RTG pathway is also linked to target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling, among whose activities is transcriptional control of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)-sensitive genes. To investigate the connections between these two signaling pathways, we have analyzed rapamycin sensitivity of the expression of the RTG target gene CIT2 and of two NCR-sensitive genes, GLN1 and DAL5, in respiratory-competent (ρ+) and -incompetent (ρ0) yeast cells. Here we have presented evidence that retrograde gene expression is separable from TOR regulation of RTG- and NCR-responsive genes. We showed that expression of these two classes of genes is differentially regulated by glutamate starvation whether in response to mitochondrial dysfunction or induced by rapamycin treatment, as well by glutamine or histidine starvation. We also showed that Lst8p, a component of the TOR1/2 complexes and a negative regulator of the RTG pathway, has multiple roles in the regulation of RTG- and NCR-sensitive genes. Lst8p negatively regulates CIT2 and GLN1 expression, whereas DAL5 expression is independent of Lst8p function. DAL5 expression depends on the GATA transcription factors Gln3p and Gat1p. Gat1p is translocated to the nucleus only upon TOR inhibition by rapamycin. Altogether, these data show that Rtg1/3p, Gln3p, and Gat1p can be differentially regulated through different nutrient-sensing pathways, such as TOR and retrograde signaling, and by multiple factors, such as Lst8p, which is suggested to have a role in connecting the RTG and TOR pathways.

The survival of cells depends on their ability to cope with environmental changes and with alterations in cellular functions through the deployment of adaptive responses in metabolic and regulatory networks. Mitochondria play an important role in cellular adaptation via a mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling pathway called retrograde regulation (1Butow R.A. Avadhani N.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of respiratory function, for instance, in cells that lack mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 petites), leads to changes in the expression of a subset of nuclear genes that enable those cells to adapt to their respiratory-deficient state (2Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In particular, a variety of anaplerotic pathways are activated in respiration-deficient cells that provide key metabolites such as acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to mitochondria to compensate for the block of the Krebs cycle. This allows respiratory-deficient cells to maintain the synthesis of α-ketoglutarate, a precursor to glutamate and glutamine, thus preventing amino acid starvation. The glyoxylate cycle gene, CIT2, encoding an isoform of citrate synthase, and DLD3, encoding a cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase, are among the genes activated in respiratory-deficient cells (3Chelstowska A.

Their expression is positively regulated by the heterodimeric transcription factors Rtg1p and Rtg3p and Rtg2p, a novel cytoplasmic protein with an N-terminal ATP binding domain that is required for the relocalization of Rtg1/3p from the cytoplasm to the nucleus when the retrograde pathway is activated (5Sekito T.

The WD-40 protein, Lst8p, is also a negative regulator of the RTG pathway (15Liu Z. Sekito T. Epstein C.B. Butow R.A.

Analysis of different mutant alleles of LST8 that result in constitutive activation of RTG target gene expression reveals that Lst8p acts at two distinct sites, one upstream and the other downstream of Rtg2p (15Liu Z. Sekito T. Epstein C.B. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7209-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Chen E.J. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 333-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The former site is believed to involve the role of Lst8p on the activity or assembly of the SPS (Ssy1p, Ptr3p, and Ssy5p) amino acid-sensing system, affecting the ability of cells to sense external glutamate (17Forsberg H. Gilstring C.F. Zargari A. Martinez P. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). How Lst8p negatively regulates the RTG pathway downstream of Rtg2p is unclear. Interestingly, Lst8p is also a component of the TOR complexes (16Chen E.J. Kaiser C.A. J.

GβL, the mammalian homologue of the yeast Lst8p, has been shown to bind to the kinase domain of mammalian TOR and to be needed, together with raptor (the homologue of yeast Kog1p), for formation of the nutrient-sensitive complex that signals to the cell growth machinery (20Kim D.H.

Inhibition of TOR results in the activation of expression of genes encoding enzymes for the synthesis of glutamate and glutamine as well as the activities of permeases responsible for the uptake of amino acids for use as a source of nitrogen. The RTG pathway has been shown to be regulated by glutamate, glutamine, and ammonia (2Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 11Dilova I.

When cells are provided with a poor nitrogen source, such as proline, or when the supply of a good nitrogen source becomes limiting, the GATA transcription factors Gln3p and Gat1p accumulate in the nucleus and activate transcription of genes of the nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) pathway, such as GLN1, whose expression is regulated by Gln3p, and DAL5, a target of Gat1p (24Cooper T.G.

Glucose starvation has also been reported to cause nuclear localization of Gln3p and increased NCR-sensitive transcription, depending upon the nitrogen source provided (26Cox K.H. Tate J.J.

Hence, to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense changes in carbon and nitrogen sources as well as the role of mitochondria in the integration of these metabolic signals, we have investigated how the retrograde and TOR signaling pathways integrate in response to specific stimuli in yeast cells. Our results show that the two pathways can be separated such that RTG responses can occur independent of TOR signaling. Strains, Media, Growth Conditions, and General Methods—Yeast strains used are reported in TABLE ONE and were grown at 30 °C in YPD, YPR, YPGly (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 2% glucose, raffinose, or glycerol, respectively), YNBcasD/R (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 1% casamino acids, 2% dextrose/raffinose) or in minimal YNBD/R medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose/raffinose) supplemented with the necessary auxotrophic requirements with or without glutamate at the concentrations indicated under “Results” and in the figures. Rapamycin (Sigma) was dissolved in 90% ethanol/10% Tween 20 and added to yeast cell cultures grown to A600 = 0.7–0.8 at a final concentration of 300 ng/ml. Incubation (30 min unless otherwise indicated) was stopped on ice for 15 min. Cell pellets were directly analyzed by fluorescence microscopy or stored at –80 °C for further analysis. MSX and 3-AT (Sigma) were dissolved in water and added to a final concentration of 2 and 50 mm, respectively.TABLE ONESaccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSource or referenceS228cMATa ura3-52Butow laboratory collectionPSY142MATα ura3 leu2 lys2 CIT2-lacZButow laboratory collectionZLY98407MATa ura3-52 CIT2::kanMX4::CIT2-lacZ lst8-1This studyZLY98573MATa ura3-52 CIT2::kanMX4::CIT2-lacZ lst8-2This studyZLY98405MATa ura3-52 CIT2::kanMX4::CIT2-lacZ lst8-4This studyZLY98577MATa ura3-52 CIT2::kanMX4::CIT2-lacZ lst8-5This studyZLY98832MATa ura3-52 CIT2::kanMX4::CIT2-lacZ lst8-5 rtg3Δ::kanMX4This studySGY127MATa ura3-52 gat1Δ::kanMX4This studySGY121MATa ura3-52 gln3Δ::kanMX4This studySGY164MATa ura3-52 gat1Δ::kanMX4 gln3::URA3This studyBY4741MATa ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0ATCCJTY413MATa ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0 sit4::KanMX4This studyZLY98711MATa ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0 pph21Δ::kanMX4 pph22Δ::kanMX4This studyZLY98713MATa ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 lys2Δ0 pph21Δ::kanMX4 sit4Δ::kanMX4This studyZLY98715MATa ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 lys2Δ0 met15Δ0 pph22Δ::kanMX4 sit4Δ::kanMX4This studyTSY279MATα ura3 leu2 lys2 RTG3-GFP(5Sekito T.

Single colonies inviable on YPGly solid medium were selected and analyzed for complete mitochondrial DNA depletion by 4′-6′-diamino-2-phenylindole staining and epifluorescence microscopy analysis. Strains carrying lst8–1, lst8–2, lst8–4, and lst8–5 mutations (15Liu Z. Sekito T. Epstein C.B. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7209-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were obtained by replacing the wild-type LST8 gene with respective lst8 mutant genes by two-step gene replacement. Deletion of GLN3 and GAT1 genes was performed by PCR amplification of the respective kanMX4 deletion cassette from the commercially available Research Genetics strain (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was isolated from gln3Δ::kanMX4/GLN3 and gat1Δ::kanMX4/GAT1 cells and amplified using the oligonucleotide couples 5′-GTGACATGGCAATGCT-3′, 5′-AGCCAGTGTTCAATGC-3′ and 5′-CCAACGTCAACAAAGCA-3′, 5′-GAAGCATAACGCACAC-3′, respectively. The PCR products were then used to replace the GLN3 and GAT1 wild-type genes in S288c cells, and the replacement was confirmed by Southern blotting analysis of genomic DNA digested with HpaI/SacI and SalI/BglII, respectively. To perform gln3Δ,gat1Δ double knock-out, a gln3Δ::URA3 deletion cassette was constructed. gln3Δ::kanMX4 module was amplified from the genomic DNA isolated from the previously constructed gln3Δ strain using the oligonucleotides 5′-GGATCCTCTAGAGTGACATGGCAATGCT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCTCGAGAGCCAGTGTTCAATGC-3′ (restriction sites used for cloning are underlined). The PCR product was subcloned into pBluescriptKS(+) (Stratagene) plasmid digested with XbaI/XhoI, and the EcoRI/SalI fragment of kanMX4 was substituted with the EcoRI/SalI fragment of URA3 cut from plasmid YDp-U (35Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), thus obtaining a recombinant pBluescriptKS(+) harboring a gln3Δ::URA3 module. The gln3Δ::URA3 cassette was then recovered by XbaI/XhoI digestion and used to replace the GLN3 wild-type gene in S288c gat1Δ::kanMX4 cells and the replacement confirmed by Southern blotting analysis of genomic DNA digested by HpaI/SacI. The sit4Δ single mutant was obtained by dissecting a SIT4/sit4Δ heterozygous diploid in BY4743 from Research Genetics. The sit4Δ,pph21Δ, sit4Δ,pph22Δ, and pph21Δ,pph22Δ double mutants were generated by crossing respective haploid mutant strains, followed by sporulation and dissection. Genomic DNA and RNA Analysis and Plasmid Constructs—Genomic DNA was isolated from 10 ml of stationary phase liquid cultures as previously described (36Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). For Southern blot analysis 4 μg of genomic DNA were digested with the relevant restriction enzymes, electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, denatured, transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by capillary blotting in 10× SSC (0.15 m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate) and cross-linked to the membrane with a Stratalinker® UV-cross-linker (Stratagene). Radiolabeled probes were added and hybridized overnight at 65 °C. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences)-labeled DNA probes for hybridization were prepared by using the Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Blots were exposed on Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Biosciences). The probes used for confirming GLN3 and GAT1 deletions were the smallest SalI digestion products of the PCR-amplified products containing gln3Δ::kanMX4 and gat1Δ::kanMX4 modules (see above), respectively. Total yeast RNA was isolated as previously described (37Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) from 50–200 ml of liquid culture (A600 = 0.7–0.8). RNA was aliquotted and stored at –80 °C. For Northern blot analysis 40 μg of RNA were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde for 3 h at room temperature. The fractionated RNAs were transferred to a Nytran membrane and hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA probes as previously described for Southern blot analysis. Hybridized blots were scanned with a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) or exposed on Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Biosciences). For quantitative Northern analysis radioactive band images were quantified against the levels of actin mRNA using ImageQuant 5.0 software (Amersham Biosciences). The DLD3, GLN1, DAL5, and ARG4 probes were amplified by PCR from selected regions of the respective genes using genomic DNA as template. The CIT2 and ACT1 probes were prepared as previously described (38Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The GFP-tagged fusions of GLN3 and GAT1 were constructed using the primer couples 5′-GGATCCACTAGTTGACGTCAACTCCATAGA-3′, 5′-GGATCCGTCGACTATACCAAATTTTAACCA-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCTAGACGGGTAAACCCCTGATAA-3′, 5′-GGATCCGTCGACTAAATTCAGATTCAACCA-3′, respectively, with restriction sites used for cloning underlined. 2960- and 2200-bp fragments containing GLN3 and GAT1 promoter and coding sequences, respectively, with the stop codon deleted were amplified from genomic DNA, digested with SpeI/SalI or XbaI/SalI, and cloned into pRS416-GFP plasmid (9Liu Z. Sekito T. Spirek M. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), yielding pRS416-GLN3-GFP and pRS416-GAT1-GFP. Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis—Cells expressing Gln3p-GFP or Gat1p-GFP proteins as indicated in Fig. 5 were grown in YNBD medium with 0.2% glutamate to A600 = 0.6–0.8 and incubated with 300 ng/ml rapamycin or 90% ethanol/10% Tween 20 as a control for 20 min at 30 °C as described above. Cells expressing Rtg3p-GFP fusion protein were grown in YNBD medium with 0.2% glutamate to A600 = 0.6–0.8 and treated with or without 50 mm 3-AT for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were concentrated by pelleting, and live cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy on a Leica microscope (model DMRXE) equipped with an HBO 100 W/2 mercury arc lamp, ×100 Plan-Apochromat objective. Epifluorescence was detected with a green fluorescence filter set (Leica N2.1–513812). Digital images were acquired with a Hamamatsu C5810 cooled CCD camera. Separation of the Retrograde and TOR Pathways—The retrograde pathway was originally defined in comparisons of gene expression between respiratory-competent ρ+ cells and respiratory-incompetent petite cells grown in rich medium (39Parikh V.S. Morgan M.M. Scott R. Clements L.S. Butow R.A. Science. 1987; 235: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To gain insight into how the retrograde and TOR signaling pathways are integrated under these growth conditions, we examined the expression of two RTG target genes, CIT2 and DLD3, and two NCR-responsive genes, GLN1 and DAL5, in ρ+ and ρ° cells before and after the addition of rapamycin to the medium. Characteristic of the retrograde response to mitochondrial dysfunction, CIT2 and DLD3 expression is higher in ρ° than in ρ+ cells (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, GLN1 expression was only slightly increased in ρ° cells, and no DAL5 expression was detected in either ρ+ or ρ° cells. Rapamycin treatment of ρ+ cells resulted in large increases in the expression of all four genes (lanes 1 and 2), in agreement with the findings of Komeili et al. (6Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, there was no substantial increase in expression of these genes in rapamycin-treated ρ° cells (lane 4), and DAL5 expression decreased somewhat under these conditions. Glutamate is a repressor of RTG-dependent gene expression (2Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, CIT2 expression was analyzed in cells grown in minimal medium containing 0.5% ammonium sulfate with or without 0.1% glutamate. A high level of CIT2 expression was observed in ρ+ cells due to glutamate starvation (Fig. 2, lane 1), with no increased expression detected in ρ° cells (lane 2). The addition of 0.1% glutamate to the culture medium abolished CIT2 expression in both ρ+ and ρ° cells (lanes 3 and 4). Rapamycin treatment resulted in an 8-fold increase in CIT2 expression in both ρ+ and ρ0 cells grown in the absence of glutamate (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6), whereas in the presence of glutamate in the medium, CIT2 expression increased 30- to 40-fold following TOR inhibition by rapamycin (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). Lst8 Mutations Increase the Expression of CIT2 and GLN1, but Not DAL5—A common feature of the RTG and TOR pathways is Lst8p. Biochemical studies have shown that Lst8p is an integral component of the TOR complexes, and it has been proposed to act as a positive regulator of TOR kinase activity (16Chen E.J. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 333-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol.

Genetic studies indicate that Lst8p is a negative regulator of the RTG pathway functioning at two sites, one upstream and the other downstream of Rtg2p (15Liu Z. Sekito T. Epstein C.B. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7209-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These regulatory sites have been revealed through the identification and analysis of collections of lst8 mutants. The lst8–1 mutant allele, for example, shows an RTG2-dependent activation of CIT2 expression, which is also observed in mutants defective in the SPS (Ssy1p, Ptr3p, and Ssy5p) amino acid-sensing system (15Liu Z. Sekito T. Epstein C.B. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7209-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that lst8–1 mutant cells are defective in targeting Ssy1p to the plasma membrane. As a consequence, lst8–1 mutant cells would behave as though they were starved for glutamate and thus up-regulate the RTG pathway because of an inactive SPS (Ssy1p, Ptr3p, and Ssy5p) sensor system. To investigate how Lst8p affects the link between RTG and TOR signaling, we compared the expression of CIT2, GLN1, and DAL5 in ρ+ wild-type and four lst8 mutants strains harboring the lst8–1 and lst8–2, lst8–4, and lst8–5 mutant alleles; the latter three mutants show RTG2-independent activation of CIT2 expression (15Liu Z. Sekito T. Epstein C.B. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7209-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These cells were grown in rich raffinose medium with or without the addition of rapamycin (Fig. 3). As expected, CIT2 expression was increased in all the lst8 mutant strains, although to somewhat different extents depending on the lst8 allele. The addition of rapamycin had little effect on the level of CIT2 expression in lst8–2, lst8–4, and lst8–5 cells but resulted in a significant increase in CIT2 expression in lst8–1 cells. Among the lst8 mutants, GLN1 was most dramatically activated in the lst8–5 mutant, and the differential levels of GLN1 expression observed among all of the lst8 mutants tested was not substantially affected by the addition of rapamycin. These data, in agreement with the findings of Chen and Kaiser (16Chen E.J. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 333-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), further suggest a complex interaction of Lst8p with TOR in that the effect of rapamycin is not a simple consequence of abrogation of a positive regulatory effect of Lst8p on TOR activity. An unexpected finding was that none of the lst8 mutants caused a detectable increase in the expression of DAL5, although both DAL5 and GLN3 are induced by rapamycin treatment. Finally, inactivation of RTG3 completely abolished the expression of CIT2 but had no effect on GLN1 and DAL5 expression in lst8–5 mutant cells in the absence or presence of rapamycin (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 12), suggesting that failure to activate DAL5 expression in lst8 mutants is not due to activation of the RTG pathway. Together, these data indicate that lst8 mutants differentiate among targets regulated by TOR. Both Gat1p and Gln3p Are Essential for Rapamycin-induced Expression of DAL5—NCR-sensitive gene expression in yeast has been shown to be mediated mainly by two GATA family transcriptional activators, Gln3p and Gat1p (24Cooper T.G.

Our current studies demonstrate that lack of MLK3 blocks signaling of activated Cdc42 to c-Jun N-terminal kinase, giving strong support for the idea that Cdc42 is a physiological activator of MLK3. We show herein that Cdc42, in a prenylation-dependent manner, targets MLK3 from a perinuclear region to membranes, including the plasma membrane. Cdc42-induced membrane targeting of MLK3 is independent of MLK3 catalytic activity but depends upon an intact Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding motif, consistent with MLK3 membrane translocation being mediated through direct binding of Cdc42. Phosphorylation of the activation loop of MLK3 requires MLK3 catalytic activity and is induced by Cdc42 in a prenylation-independent manner, arguing that Cdc42 binding is sufficient for activation loop autophosphorylation of MLK3. However, membrane targeting is necessary for full activation of MLK3 and maximal signaling to JNK. We previously reported that MLK3 is autoinhibited through an interaction between its N-terminal SH3 domain and a proline-containing sequence found between the leucine zipper and the CRIB motif of MLK3. Thus we propose a model in which GTP-bound Cdc42/Rac binds MLK3 and disrupts SH3-mediated autoinhibition leading to dimerization and activation loop autophosphorylation. Targeting of this partially active MLK3 to membranes likely results in additional phosphorylation events that fully activate MLK3 and its ability to maximally signal through the JNK pathway.

Targeting of this partially active MLK3 to membranes likely results in additional phosphorylation events that fully activate MLK3 and its ability to maximally signal through the JNK pathway. The activation of protein kinases and the specification of their signaling pathways is a highly orchestrated process that is accomplished through dynamic and reversible events including phosphorylation, molecular interactions with proteins or other effector molecules, and subcellular targeting. Altered subcellular localization may impact protein kinase activation, signaling, or both. For instance, whether a protein kinase encounters an activating protein may depend upon its subcellular localization. Alternatively, many protein kinases have multiple in vivo substrates and signaling pathways, and spatiotemporal localization of protein kinases provides a mechanism by which substrate and signaling specificity can be achieved.

Deciphering how MLK3 is regulated is critical to our ultimate understanding of how MLK3 integrates different MAPK signaling pathways. Autoregulatory interactions are key to controlling MLK3 activity and signaling. The catalytic domain of MLK3 is flanked by an N-terminal SH3 domain and a centrally located zipper and Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding (CRIB) motif. Zipper-mediated homo-oligomerization is required for full activity of MLK3, proper substrate phosphorylation, and activation of the JNK pathway (17Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Vacratsis P.O. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27893-27900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Work from our lab indicates that MLK3 is autoinhibited through an interaction between its SH3 domain and a proline-containing sequence within MLK3 (19Zhang H. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45598-45603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation also contributes to the regulation of MLK3. Site-directed mutagenesis data indicate that activation loop phosphorylation of Thr277 and Ser281 is critical for MLK3 activity (20Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1961-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition MLK3 is reported to be negatively regulated by Akt phosphorylation (21Barthwal M.K.

Finally, in vivo labeling coupled with mass spectrometry has revealed multiple sites of phosphorylation of MLK3, most of which are clustered at the C terminus (22Vacratsis P.O. Phinney B.S. Gage D.A. Gallo K.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5613-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whose functions are currently under study. Cdc42 and Rac are Rho family GTPases that regulate diverse cellular processes including actin cytoskeleton remodeling, vesicular transport, endocytosis, cell cycle progression, cellular transformation, motility, and cell polarity (23Cerione R.A.

Cerione R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Like all members of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac are able to associate with cellular membranes by virtue of posttranslational prenylation of the Cys of the C-terminal CAAX motif (28Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 29Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). A second signal for membrane localization, found in the so-called hypervariable region immediately upstream of the CAAX motif, typically contains either palmitoylation sites (30Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) or a series of basic residues (31Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2).

Herein we provide evidence that Cdc42 induces JNK signaling through endogenous MLK3. Furthermore we show that activated Cdc42 translocates MLK3 to membranes and induces activation loop phosphorylation of MLK3. The data presented support a mechanism whereby Cdc42 binding is sufficient for activation loop autophosphorylation of MLK3, but prenylation-dependent, Cdc42-induced membrane targeting of MLK3, which does not in itself require MLK3 activity, is required for full activation of MLK3 and signaling to JNK. This work provides important insight into the molecular mechanism by which Cdc42 activates MLK3 and its signaling pathways.

The phospho-c-Jun (KM-1) mouse monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and actin mouse monoclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Other antibodies used were the MLK3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (34Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol.

HeLa cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with 250 nmol of siRNA oligonucleotide/well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 20 h, transfections using FLAG-Cdc42V12 expression vector were performed; and after another 20 h, the cells were lysed. Expression Vectors and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The construction of the cytomegalovirus-based expression vectors containing the cDNA for the wild type MLK3 (pRK5-mlk3) has been described elsewhere (35Gallo K.A.

The expression plasmid construct encoding the N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged constitutively active Cdc42 (pRK5-N-FLAG.cdc42V12) was kindly provided by Avi Ashkenazi (Genentech, Inc.). Variants of Cdc42V12 containing point mutations were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) and 15 cycles of amplification. To generate pRK5-NFLAG.cdc42V12C188S, 5′-GATGTTCATAGCAGCACAGATCTGCGGCTCTTCTTCG-3′ and its reverse complement were used as primers, and pRK5-NFLAG.cdc42V12 was used as the template. To substitute Lys183, Lys184, Arg186, and Arg187 of Cdc42 with neutral Gln residues, pRK5-NFLAG.cdc42V12C188S, was used as a template in two successive rounds of mutagenesis using the following primers and their reverse complements: 5′-CCAGAACCGAAGAAGAGCCAGAGGTCTGTGCTGCTATGAAC-3′ for the first round and 5′-GCCTCCAGAACCGCAGCAGAGCCAGCAGTCTGTGCTGCTATGAAC-3′ for the second round. The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Michigan State University Genomics Technology Support Facility). Cell Lines and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured and transfected using the calcium phosphate method as previously described (34Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 8% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Subcellular Fractionation—Plasma membrane-enriched fractions were generated according to Stokoe et al. (36Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and disrupted in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 35 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na4PPi, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 μm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin). The cells were homogenized with 60 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Centrifugation of the supernatant at 4 °C at 16,900 × g yielded a plasma membrane-enriched pellet (P16.9) fraction and a soluble (S16.9) fraction. The pellet fractions were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na4PPi, 10 mm NaF, 100 μm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin). The protein concentrations in each fraction were determined using Bradford assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Either equal amounts of total protein or equal cellular equivalents from the S16.9 and P16.9 fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE as indicated in figure legends, and Western blotting for MLK3 and FLAG-Cdc42 was performed as described below. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitations—The cells were harvested and lysed as described previously (18Vacratsis P.O. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27893-27900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The clarified lysates were incubated with antibody-bound protein A-agarose for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Lysates and immunoprecipitates of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and Western blotted using appropriate antibodies. Western blots were developed by the chemiluminescence method. Multiple exposures of the Western blots were developed, and densitometry (ImageJ, rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) of unsaturated films was used to determine relative expression levels/phosphorylation. The statistics were calculated using an unpaired Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells were plated onto 6-well plates containing cover slips (1 × 105 cells/well) and transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection for 16-18 h, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed in 2% formaldehyde (Polyscience, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS. The cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 37 °C and blocked in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and RNase A (100 μg/ml) for 60 min at room temperature. After incubation with the primary antibody (5 μg/ml of the MLK3 rabbit polyclonal antibody or 3.5 μg/ml FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum and incubated for 1 h with the appropriate Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). After extensive washing with PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum, the nuclei were stained with TO-PRO-3 iodide (2 μm; Molecular Probes, Inc.) and mounted onto glass slides. The fluorescently labeled cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM Pascal confocal laser scanning microscope. Three separate tracks were used for capturing fluorescent images; excitation was done using 488-, 543-, and 633-nm lasers with BP 500-530 nm (FLAG-Cdc42, represented in green), BP 560-615 nm (MLK3, represented in red) and LP 650 nm (TO-PRO-3 iodide, represented in blue), respectively, as emission filters (Fig. 4). Immune Complex Kinase Assays—For measurement of MLK3 activity in the plasma-enriched fractions, an immune complex kinase assay of the solubilized P16.9 fractions was performed. The relative amounts of MLK3 in the P16.9 fractions from cells expressing MLK3 alone or MLK3 plus Cdc42V12 were determined by densitometry (NIH Image) and adjusted to ensure equal amounts of immunoprecipitated MLK3 from the P16.9 fractions. Solubilized portions of the P16.9 fractions were incubated with 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads prebound with MLK3 antibody for 90 min at 4 °C. The MLK3 kinase assay was carried out as described previously (18Vacratsis P.O. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27893-27900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), except that 10 μg of purified GST-MKK4 was used as substrate. The extent of GST-MKK4 phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting with an anti-phospho-MKK4 antibody. For measurement of MLK3 activity in total cellular lysates, the MLK3 precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer. 8 μg of recombinant, catalytically inactive GST-MKK7 K165A (9Zhang H. Wu W. Du Y. Santos S.J. Conrad S.E. Watson J.T. Grammatikakis N. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was used as substrate, and the reaction was carried out for 20 min at room temperature. The extent of GST-MKK7 phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting with a phospho-MKK7 antibody. Cdc42-induced JNK Activation Requires MLK3—Previous studies have demonstrated that activated Cdc42 binds MLK3 and increases its catalytic activity (33Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 34Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, these studies have relied upon ectopically expressed MLK3. To determine whether Cdc42 regulates JNK signaling through endogenous MLK3, Cdc42-induced JNK activation was measured in HeLa cells in which MLK3 expression was abolished using RNA interference (15Chadee D.N. Kyriakis J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, Cdc42-induced JNK activation is reduced at least 5-fold upon transfection with human-specific siRNA but not the control siRNA, indicating that MLK3 is a major physiological target of Cdc42 in signaling to JNK. Membrane Targeting-defective Variants of Activated Cdc42 Are Able to Interact with MLK3—The C-terminal CAAX motif of Cdc42 serves as a target for geranylgeranylation, thus endowing Cdc42 with the ability to associate with membranes. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that prenylated, activated Cdc42 localizes MLK3 to cellular membranes. To study the potential of Cdc42-induced membrane targeting of MLK3, variants of Cdc42 that fail to undergo prenylation and/or lack the basic secondary membrane targeting motifs were constructed as diagrammed in Fig. 2A. Specifically, the prenylation site Cys188 in the CAAX motif of Cdc42V12 was mutated to Ser (Fig. 2A). In yeast, this analogous change of a sulfhydryl to a hydroxyl group prevents prenylation and rescues the lethal phenotype induced by constitutively active Cdc42V12 (37Ziman M. O'Brien J.M. Ouellette L.A. Church W.R. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3537-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In initial fractionation experiments, the prenylation-defective mutant of Cdc42V12 C188S was found primarily in a soluble fraction, but a small amount was still retained in a membrane-enriched fraction (data not shown). This observation suggests that, even in the absence of prenylation, the hypervariable region of Cdc42 mediates residual membrane binding, as has been shown for K-Ras (31Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Consequently the four basic residues in the hypervariable region of Cdc42, Lys183, Lys184,Arg186, and Arg187 were mutated to neutral glutamine residues to generate Cdc42V12C188S, K/R4Q (Fig. 2A). Two of these residues, Lys183 and Lys184, are critical for endomembrane binding of Cdc42 through γ-COP (38Wu W.J. Erickson J.W. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This variant, Cdc42V12C188S, K/R4Q, was present only in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3A). As has been observed for Ras (30Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 31Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 39Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20054-20059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the posttranslationally modified Cdc42 migrates more rapidly than the unprenylated mutant form in SDS-PAGE. To rule out the possibility that the introduced mutations interfere with the ability of Cdc42V12 to interact with MLK3, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, both prenylation-defective variants of Cdc42V12 associate with MLK3 to the same extent, indicating that the geranylgeranyl group and the C-terminal basic residues of Cdc42 are not required for association with MLK3. Activated Cdc42 Targets MLK3 to a Plasma Membrane-enriched Fraction—To determine whether Cdc42 impacts the subcellular distribution of MLK3, biochemical fractionation experiments were performed using HEK 293 cells transiently expressing MLK3 and variants of constitutively active Cdc42V12. The distribution of MLK3 between a soluble (S16.9) and a plasma membrane-enriched pellet (P16.9) fraction was assessed by Western blotting. Data from a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 3A. Based on five independent experiments, MLK3 is distributed approximately equally between the S16.9 and P16.9 fractions when expressed alone. In contrast, upon coexpression with activated Cdc42V12, MLK3 is found predominantly in the P16.9 fraction. However, activated Cdc42V12 is present in both fractions, as has been reported for overexpressed RasV12 in COS cells (36Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Coexpression of MLK3 with the membrane targeting-defective, activated GTPase, Cdc42V12C188S, K/R4Q yielded a fractionation pattern identical to that of MLK3 alone (Fig. 3A), indicating that activated Cdc42V12 alters the subcellular localization of MLK3 in a prenylation-dependent manner. To confirm that MLK3 is only activated at the plasma membrane upon targeting by Cdc42, the catalytic activity of MLK3 in the P16.9 fractions was measured in in vitro kinase assays. The P16.9 fractions were solubilized in Triton X-100-containing buffer, and equal amounts of immunoprecipitated MLK3 were subjected to in vitro kinase assays using unlabeled ATP and recombinant GST-MKK4 as substrates. Phosphorylation of the activation segment of MKK4 was monitored using a phospho-specific antibody against MKK4. Data from three independent experiments demonstrate that MLK3 activity is present in the plasma membrane-enriched fractions only in the presence of active, prenylated Cdc42 (Fig. 3B). When MLK3 is expressed alone or with the prenylation-defective Cdc42V12C188S, K/R4Q, negligible MLK3 activity resides in the P16.9 fraction. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that functional prenylation is required for Cdc42-mediated targeting and activation of MLK3 at the plasma membrane. Activated Cdc42 and MLK3 Colocalize at the Plasma Membrane—To examine the subcellular localization of Cdc42V12 and MLK3 in cells, confocal microscopy experiments were performed using HeLa cells transfected with vectors encoding MLK3 and Cdc42V12 variants. MLK3 alone displays prominent perinuclear staining along with punctate, vesicular patterns and limited diffuse cytosolic staining (Fig. 4, top panel). These data are in general agreement with reports that MLK3 localizes to the Golgi (40Cha H. Smith B.L. Gallo K. Machamer C.E. Shapiro P. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and centrosome regions (41Swenson K.I. Winkler K.E. Means A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 156-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cdc42V12 has been previously shown to localize to the plasma membrane (42Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). When MLK3 is coexpressed with Cdc42V12, they clearly colocalize at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4, center panel). In contrast the prenylation-defective, activated Cdc42V12 consistently displays cytosolic staining. In the presence of prenylation-defective Cdc42V12, MLK3 fails to localize to the plasma memb"

https://openalex.org/W2171631362,"Defective expression of dystrophin in muscle cells is the primary feature of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is accompanied by fiber necrosis and intracellular calcium mishandling. These features led to the hypothesis that dystrophin could control calcium movements. Calcium mishandling in human DMD myotubes is dependent on contraction and/or calcium release activity, suggesting the involvement of channels being activated during these processes. Forced expression of minidystrophin at the plasma membrane of dystrophin-deficient Sol8 myotubes reactivates appropriate sarcolemmal expression of dystrophin-associated proteins and results in normal calcium homeostasis. In active dystrophic myotubes, store-operated calcium channels could be responsible for a sustained calcium influx in muscle cells. We show here that depletion of calcium stores (sarcoplasmic reticulum) by repetitive activation of calcium release and blockade of SERCA leads to a calcium influx. In myotubes expressing recombinant minidystrophin, these store-dependent influxes were reduced to a level similar to that observed in myotubes expressing native dystrophin. High store-dependent calcium influxes in dystrophin-deficient myotubes were associated with sustained cytosolic calcium transients and high intramitochondrial entries, while lower store-dependent calcium influx in myotubes expressing minidystrophin resulted in shorter calcium transients and reduced calcium uptake into mitochondria. We propose that minidystrophin negatively regulates sarcolemmal store-dependent calcium channels, which reduces store-dependent calcium influx, as well as its mitochondrial uptake. Forced expression of minidystrophin in dystrophic cells might restore the regulation of sarcolemmal store-dependent channels, which could protect against calcium mishandling."
https://openalex.org/W1521559784,"Glomerular mesangial cells can produce high amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we analyzed the impact of NO on the ROS-generating system, particularly on the NADPH oxidase Nox1. Nox1 mRNA and protein levels were markedly decreased by treatment of mesangial cells with the NO-releasing compound DETA-NO in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. By altering the cGMP signaling system with different inhibitors or activators, we revealed that the effect of NO on Nox1 expression is at least in part mediated by cGMP. Analysis of a reporter construct comprising the 2547 bp of the nox1 promoter region revealed that a stimulatory effect of IL-1beta on nox1 transcription is counteracted by an inhibitory effect of IL-1beta-evoked endogenous NO formation. Moreover, pretreatment of mesangial cells with DETA-NO attenuated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB or serum stimulated production of superoxide as assessed by real-time EPR spectroscopy and dichlorofluorescein formation. Transfection of mesangial cells with siRNAs directed against Nox1 and Nox4 revealed that inhibition of Nox1, but not Nox4 expression, is responsible for the reduced ROS formation by NO. Obviously, there exists a fine-tuned crosstalk between NO and ROS generating systems in the course of inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2020989705,"To gain more insights about the biological roles of PDK1, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system and in vivo binding assay to identify interacting molecules that associate with PDK1. As a result, serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP), a transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor-interacting protein, was identified as an interacting partner of PDK1. STRAP was found to form in vivo complexes with PDK1 in intact cells. Mapping analysis revealed that this binding was only mediated by the catalytic domain of PDK1 and not by the pleckstrin homology domain. Insulin enhanced a physical association between PDK1 and STRAP in intact cells, but this insulin-induced association was prevented by wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor. In addition, the association between PDK1 and STRAP was decreased by TGF-β treatment. Analysis of the activities of the interacting proteins showed that PDK1 kinase activity was significantly increased by coexpression of STRAP, probably through the inhibition of the binding of 14-3-3, a negative regulator, to PDK1. Consistently, knockdown of the endogenous STRAP by the transfection of the small interfering RNA resulted in the decrease of PDK1 kinase activity. PDK1 also exhibited an inhibition of TGF-β signaling with STRAP by contributing to the stable association between TGF-β receptor and Smad7. Moreover, confocal microscopic study and immunostaining results demonstrated that PDK1 prevented the nuclear translocation of Smad3 in response to TGF-β. Knockdown of endogenous PDK1 with small interfering RNA has an opposite effect. Taken together, these results suggested that STRAP acts as an intermediate signaling molecule linking between the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PDK1 and the TGF-β signaling pathways.

TGF-β receptors subsequently propagate signals downstream through direct interaction with cytoplasmic Smads, and possibly other proteins as well (7Piek E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P.

Smad proteins are subdivided into three classes, the receptorregulated Smads (R-Smads), the common Smads (Co-Smads), and the inhibitory Smads (I-Smads). Once phosphorylation, R-Smads, including Smads 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8, dissociate from the type I TGF-β receptor and physically associate with Co-Smads such as Smad 4, and translocate into the nucleus and regulate the transcription from specific gene promoters (10Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). In addition to Smads, several proteins interacting with TβR-I or TβR-II have been identified (4Engel M.E. Datta P.K. Moses H.L. J. Cell.

Among them, serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP), a novel WD40 domain-containing protein, was shown to interact with both TβR-I and TβR-II and to inhibit TGF-β signaling (12Datta P.K. Chytil A. Gorska A.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34671-34674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, STRAP was shown to stabilize the complex formation between Smad7, an inhibitory Smad, and activated TβR-I in the inhibition of TGF-β signaling, preventing Smad2 and Smad3 from access to the receptor (13Datta P.K.

Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). PDK1 is broadly expressed and has been described as constitutive (15Casamayor A. Morrice N. Alessi D.R.

In addition, recent studies have shown that insulin inhibits TGF-β-mediated apoptosis and that PI3K signaling can be activated by TGF-β, suggesting a functional link between PI3K and TGF-β signaling pathways (22Tanaka S. Wands J.R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3391-3394PubMed Google Scholar, 23Buenemann C.L. Willy C. Buchmann A. Schmiechen A. Schwarz M.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate how these two signaling pathways are physically and functionally associated with each other.In this study, we show that STRAP interacts with PDK1 and that this interaction is important for the modulation of PDK1 activity. Moreover, coexpression of PDK1 results in the enhancement of the STRAP-dependent TGF-β transcriptional inhibition. These findings provide insights into the cross-talk between PI3K/PDK1 and TGF-β signaling pathways.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Plasmids, and Reagents—293T, HepG2, Hep3B, and SK-N-BE(2)C cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) as described (26Jung H.

The p3TP-Lux reporter plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. J. Massague (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). To generate two deletion constructs, FLAG-PDK1(PH) and FLAG-PDK1(CA), we performed a PCR using the full-length PDK1 cDNA as the template.

The amplified PCR products for deletion mutants were cut with EcoRI plus XhoI and EcoRI plus SalI, and cloned into pFLAG-PAG (26Jung H. Kim T. Chae H.-Z. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol.

The identity of all PCR products was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing analysis on both strands. To generate GST-STRAP, we first cloned the EcoRI/XhoI fragment of STRAP cloned in pJG4-5 into pBacPAK9 (Clontech), digested with EcoRI plus NotI, and subcloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene). Finally, the ClaI/NotI fragment of the resulting plasmid was cloned into pEBG cut with ClaI and NotI, yielding pEBG-STRAP (GST-STRAP). On the other hand, to generate FLAG-STRAP, a STRAP cDNA (pJG4-5-STRAP) was subcloned as an EcoRI/XhoI fragment into the EcoRI/SalI site of pFLAG-PAG (26Jung H. Kim T. Chae H.-Z. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J.

The animals were boosted four times every week and bled from the ear vein 10 days after the last injection. A titer of the antiserum was measured by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Antiserum was removed by centrifugation after incubation at 37 °C for 3 h.Yeast Two-hybrid Specificity Test—A fish plasmid, pJG4-5 harboring PDK1, was transformed back into EGY48 cells along with either the bait plasmid, pEG202 harboring STRAP, or other several bait plasmids available in our laboratory as described (28Seong H.-A. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Transient Transfection and in Vivo Interaction Assay—Each plasmid DNA indicated under “Results” was transfected into 293T or HepG2 cells with a calcium phosphate precipitation method or Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight incubation, the cells transfected were incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (100 pm) for 20 h. Cells were then washed and solubilized with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 as described (28Seong H.-A. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Detergent-insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, and the cleared lysates were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer. For immunoblotting, coprecipitates or whole cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies and then developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Assay of PDK1 Kinase Activity—Cells transiently transfected were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized with 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.3 m NaCl). The cleared lysates were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads and rotated for 2 h at 4°C. After washing the precipitate three times with lysis buffer and then twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2), the precipitate was incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of kinase buffer containing 500 ng of recombinant SGK (Upstate), separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and detected by autoradiography.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Experiments—The PDK1 siRNA of the oligonucleotides (5′-GGACUCGAACUCCUUUGAATT-3′) targeting a coding region (amino acids 420–425) on the human PDK1 (GenBank™ accession number Y15056) and STRAP siRNA oligonucleotides (334, 5′-GGGUGCAACACUGAAUAAG-3′; 515, 5′-UUACGCAUAUAUGACUUGA-3′) corresponding to two coding regions (334, amino acids 64–69; 515, amino acids 124–129) of human STRAP (GenBank™ accession number BC000162) were synthesized by SamChully Pharm. Co. Ltd. (Seoul, Korea). The sense and antisense oligonucleotides for each siRNA were mixed and heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and the combined reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. 293T or HepG2 cells were plated in 6-well flat-bottomed microplates (Nunc) at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells per well the day before transfection. siRNA oligonucleotides (50 nm) were transfected into cells using the Lipofectamine Plus method. After 48 h transfection, reverse transcription-PCR or immunoblottings were carried out to confirm the downregulation of target proteins.Luciferase Reporter Assay—HepG2 cells were transfected according to the Lipofectamine Plus method with the p3TP-Lux reporter plasmid, along with each expression vector as indicated. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was monitored with a luciferase assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Light emission was determined with a Berthold luminometer (Microlumat LB96P). The cell extracts containing equal amounts of PDK1 and STRAP, determined by Western blot analysis, were used for luciferase assay, and the total DNA concentration was constantly kept by supplementing with empty vector DNAs. The values were adjusted with respect to expression levels of a cotransfected β-galactosidase reporter control, and experiments were repeated at least three times.Assays for Cell Death and Cell Survival—293T cells undergoing apoptosis, after treatment with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), were quantitated by staining with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and the fluorescent dye propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Cells in 6-cm dishes treated with TNF-α and cycloheximide for 14 h were harvested and incubated with annexin V- and propidium iodidecontaining buffer for 10 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS as described (28Seong H.-A. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 10,000 events were analyzed per sample using a FACSCalibur-S system (BD Biosciences). For a cell death experiment using the GFP system, 293T cells grown on sterile coverslips were transfected with pEGFP, an expression vector encoding GFP, together with expression vectors as indicated. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated with TNF-α and cycloheximide. The cells were fixed with icecold 100% methanol, washed three times with PBS, and then stained with bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258). The coverslips were washed with PBS, then mounted on glass slides, using Gelvatol, and visualized under a fluorescence microscope as described previously (28Seong H.-A. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei divided by the total number of GFP-positive cells. For a cell survival assay, 293T cells transfected with a STRAP-specific siRNA (515) for 12 h were seeded in 24-well plates at a concentration of 4–5 × 104 cells per well and allowed to grow in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% FBS. The cell number was counted with a hemocytometer at the indicated times. By using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assaybased cell counting kit-8 (Dojindo), the percentage of cell survival was determined by estimating the value of parental cells at the indicated times as 100%.Immunofluorescene and Confocal Microscopy—Hep3B cells were plated and transfected with FLAG-Smad3 and/or MYC-tagged PDK1 constructs on sterile coverslips, placed on ice, and washed three times with ice-cold PBS prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS, treated with 0.2% Triton X-100, and rewashed with PBS. The mouse anti-FLAG (M2) antibody diluted 1000-fold in PBS or rabbit anti-MYC antibody diluted 200-fold in PBS was applied for 2 h at 37°C.The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with 1000-fold diluted Alexa Fluor-594 anti-mouse secondary antibody or Alexa Fluor-488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 1 h. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and then mounted on glass slides, using Gelvatol. Confocal laser scanning microscopy observations were done on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 15-milliwatt argon-krypton laser as described (28Seong H.-A. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).RESULTSPDK1 Interacts with STRAP—To explore the mechanism by which PDK1 activity is regulated, we employed a yeast two-hybrid specificity test to search PDK1-interacting proteins using more than 30 different baits available in our laboratory, together with the fish plasmid, pJG4-5 harboring a full-length of PDK1 cDNA, as described previously (28Seong H.-A. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). From this random screening, we found that PDK1 cDNA interacted with a tested bait plasmid, pEG202 harboring STRAP (results not shown). Based on this, to investigate a possible cross-talk between PDK1 and TGF-β signaling pathways, we first performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro kinase assay using the human embryonic kidney carcinoma cell line 293T. Endogenous PDK1 immunoprecipitate from cell lysates treated with TGF-β significantly reduced PDK1 activity about 3.0-fold compared with the control PDK1 immunoprecipitate untreated with TGF-β (Fig. 1), suggesting that a functional link between PDK1 and TGF-β signaling pathways may exist.We then speculated that PDK1 might interact with STRAP in intact cells, and we performed cotransfection experiments using GST- and FLAG-tagged eukaryotic expression vectors. In these experiments, the wild-type PDK1 and STRAP were coexpressed as a GST fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged protein in cells, respectively. The interactions of FLAG-tagged STRAP proteins to the GST-PDK1 fusion proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, the STRAP was detected in the coprecipitate only when coexpressed with the GST-PDK1 but not with the control GST alone, in addition to the failure of the binding of the control vector alone (CMV) to GST-PDK1, demonstrating that PDK1 physically interacts with STRAP. In order to confirm the interaction between PDK1 and STRAP, we next carried out coimmunoprecipitation experiments using FLAG-STRAP-transfected 293T cell extract and endogenous PDK1 (Fig. 2B). Endogenous PDK1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and Western blot analysis showed that PDK1 was precipitated (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The binding of STRAP was subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. STRAP was only present in the PDK1 immunoprecipitate when coexpressed with the FLAG-STRAP (Fig. 2B, upper panel) but not in the control transfected the vector alone (CMV). In addition, to examine the interaction between the two endogenous proteins, we produced antiserum specific to STRAP as described under “Materials and Methods.” The specificity of the antiserum was confirmed by immunoblotting using cell extracts from 293T cells transfected with FLAG-STRAP (results not shown). As shown in Fig. 2C, immunoprecipitation of endogenous PDK1 by anti-PDK1 antibody and then immunoblotting with STRAP-specific antiserum showed the interaction of these two endogenous proteins, regardless of cell types used. This interaction was also confirmed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments in which STRAP-specific antiserum, instead of anti-PDK1 antibody, was used for immunoprecipitation (results not shown). Taken together, our results demonstrate that PDK1 associates with STRAP in vivo.FIGURE 2Association of PDK1 with STRAP in vivo. A, pEBG vector alone (GST), as a negative control, and pEBG-PDK1 (GST-PDK1) were cotransfected with either FLAG-tagged STRAP (FLAG-STRAP) containing the full-length human STRAP cDNA or pFLAG-CMV2 vector (CMV) into 293T cells. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathioneSepharose beads (GST purification), and the complex formation (top panel) and the amount of FLAG-tagged STRAP used for an in vivo binding assay (bottom panel, Lysate) were determined by anti-FLAG antibody immunoblot (IB). The same blot was stripped and re-probed with an anti-GST antibody (middle panel) to confirm the expression of GST-PDK1 and a GST control (GST). B, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the vector alone (CMV), as a negative control, or FLAG-STRAP, and lysed and immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-PDK1 antibody. The PDK1 immunoprecipitate was analyzed for the presence of STRAP by immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody (upper panel). The amount of immunoprecipitated PDK1 was analyzed using anti-PDK1 antibody (lower panel). C, cell lysates from the parental 293T, Hep3B, and SK-N-BE(2)C cells were immunoprecipitated with rabbit preimmune serum (preimm.) or rabbit anti-PDK1 antibody (α-PDK1). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with STRAP-specific antiserum. These experiments were performed in duplicate at least four times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Catalytic Domain of PDK1 Specifically Binds to STRAP in Vivo—To determine which region of PDK1 was necessary for the association with STRAP, we generated two PDK1 deletion constructs FLAG-PDK1(PH), comprising the carboxyl-terminal PH domain (amino acids 411–556), and FLAG-PDK1(CA), harboring the catalytic domain (amino acids 67–359) as described in Fig. 3A, and we examined the ability of the constructs to form a complex with STRAP. GST-STRAP construct was expressed in 293T cells and used for in vivo binding assay with FLAG-PDK1(PH), FLAG-PDK1(CA), and wild-type FLAG-PDK1. As shown in Fig. 3B, the binding of wild-type FLAG-PDK1 and FLAG-PDK1(CA) with GST-STRAP was detectable (top panel, 4th and 6th lanes), whereas the interaction could not be observed between FLAG-PDK1(PH) and GST-STRAP (top panel, 5th lane). These results clearly defined the amino-terminal catalytic kinase domain of PDK1 as essential for STRAP binding in vivo.FIGURE 3Domains of PDK1 involved in the PDK1-STRAP association. A, the schematic structures of PDK1 wild-type and deletion constructs. Kinase and PH indicate the catalytic kinase domain and PH domain of PDK1, respectively. The numbers indicate amino acid residues, and amino acid number of domain boundaries is indicated. B, 293T cells were cotransfected with a GST alone or GST-STRAP, together with FLAG-PDK1 (WT, wild-type PDK1), FLAG-PDK1(CA) containing only the catalytic kinase domain of PDK1 (amino acids 67–359), and FLAG-PDK1(PH) harboring only the PH domain of PDK1 (amino acids 411–556), and precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GST purification). A complex formation was determined by immunoblot (IB) analysis using anti-FLAG antibody (top panel). The same blot was re-probed with an anti-GST antibody to confirm the expression of GST fusion proteins in the coprecipitates (middle panel), and the expression level of FLAG-tagged proteins in total cell lysates (Lysate) was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody (bottom panel). These experiments were performed in duplicate at least five times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TGF-β and Insulin Modulate PDK1-STRAP Complex Formation—It has been demonstrated previously that the STRAP phosphorylation is slightly modulated when cells are stimulated by TGF-β and that TGF-β signaling pathway is regulated by insulin stimulation (13Datta P.K.

By this process, astrocytes may participate in intercellular communication and neuromodulation. Acute inflammation in vitro, induced by adding reactive microglia to astrocyte cultures, enhances TNFα production and amplifies glutamate release, switching the pathway into a neurodamaging cascade (Bezzi, P., Domercq, M., Brambilla, L., Galli, R., Schols, D., De Clercq, E., Vescovi, A., Bagetta, G., Kollias, G., Meldolesi, J., and Volterra, A. (2001) Nat. Neurosci. 4, 702–710). Because glial inflammation is a component of Alzheimer disease (AD) and TNFα is overexpressed in AD brains, we investigated possible alterations of the cytokine-dependent pathway in PDAPP mice, a transgenic model of AD. Glutamate release was measured in acute hippocampal and cerebellar slices from mice at early (4-month-old) and late (12-month-old) disease stages in comparison with age-matched controls. Surprisingly, TNFα-evoked glutamate release, normal in 4-month-old PDAPP mice, was dramatically reduced in the hippocampus of 12-month-old animals. This defect correlated with the presence of numerous β-amyloid deposits and hypertrophic astrocytes. In contrast, release was normal in cerebellum, a region devoid of β-amyloid deposition and astrocytosis. The Ca2+-dependent process by which TNFα evokes glutamate release in acute slices is distinct from synaptic release and displays properties identical to those observed in cultured astrocytes, notably PG dependence. However, prostaglandin E2 induced normal glutamate release responses in 12-month-old PDAPP mice, suggesting that the pathology-associated defect involves the TNFα-dependent control of secretion rather than the secretory process itself. Reduced expression of DENN/MADD, a mediator of TNFα-PG coupling, might account for the defect. Alteration of this neuromodulatory astrocytic pathway is described here for the first time in relation to Alzheimer disease.

Alteration of this neuromodulatory astrocytic pathway is described here for the first time in relation to Alzheimer disease. Studies over the last 15 years provide new insight in the neuron-astrocyte interrelations, revealing that astrocytes do not merely support neuronal functions but also actively control them (for review, see Refs. 2Haydon P.G.

Therefore, they provide a good experimental model to study changes occurring in astrocytes during the development of the disease. The properties of Ca2+-dependent glutamate release evoked by stimulation of the TNFα-dependent pathway were evaluated in brain slices from PDAPP mice at early and late stages of the disease and compared with those of age-matched non-transgenic littermates. We report a region-specific alteration of TNFα-dependent glutamate release in the hippocampus of aged PDAPP mice correlated to the presence of Aβ deposits and reactive astrocytosis. At variance with the observations in the acute inflammation paradigm in vitro, in the PDAPP mice the cytokine-dependent process was found to be dramatically impaired. Animals—Homozygous transgenic mice carrying the APPV717F familial AD mutation under the control of the platelet-derived growth factor-β promoter (PDAPP, 4-month-old animals, n = 14; 12-month-old animals, n = 17) (28Games D.

These mice are derived from a hybrid background representing combinations of C57BL/6J x DBA/2J x Swiss-Webster strains. Materials—Percoll was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. TNFα was from R&D Systems. The anti-pan β-amyloid antibody was purchased from BIOSOURCE. The antibody anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was from DAKO. The anti-differentially expressed in normal versus neoplastic (DENN)/mitogen-activated protein kinase activating death domain (MADD) polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Ulrich Blank (INSERM U699, Paris, France). All the other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. Acute Brain Slice—Acute brain slices were prepared as previously described (1Bezzi P. Domercq M. Brambilla L. Galli R. Schols D. De Clercq E. Vescovi A. Bagetta G. Kollias G. Meldolesi J. Volterra A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 13Bezzi P. Carmignoto G. Pasti L. Vesce S. Rossi D. Rizzini B.L. Pozzan T. Volterra A. Nature. 1998; 391: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were killed, their brains were removed, and the two hemispheres were separately processed for preparing acute slices or for immunohistochemistry. The hemi-brain used for preparing the slices was immersed in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid of the composition 120 mm NaCl, 3.1 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 4 mm glucose, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm myo-inositol, 0.1 mm ascorbic acid, pH 7.4, bubbled with a 95% O2, 5% CO2 gas mixture. Transverse thin slices (200 μm) from brain or cerebellum were prepared using a Vibratome (Campden Instruments). Hippocampal slices were carefully isolated from the coronal brain section by gently removing the extraneous cortical tissue. Slices were subsequently placed in a chamber thermostated at 37 °C and containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid continuously bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 for at least 1 h before processing. Synaptosomal Preparation—Synaptosomes from mouse hippocampus were prepared using the Percoll gradient method (38Dunkley P.R. Heath J.W. Harrison S.M. Jarvie P.E. Glenfield P.J. Rostas J.A. Brain Res. 1988; 441: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15–20 hippocampi/experiment were removed, placed in ice-cold sucrose buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), and homogenized in a Teflon glass homogenizer (12 times at 2800 rpm). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended and spun again at 15,700 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were pooled, layered onto discontinuous sucrose-Percoll gradients (2.5 ml of 23% Percoll, 3 ml of 10%, and 2.5 ml of 3%) and centrifuged at 38,600 × g. The synaptosomal fraction was recovered from the 23%, 10% Percoll interface. Synaptosomes were washed twice in 30 volumes of ice-cold Krebs buffer (135 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4,2mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 12.5 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and stored in suspension at 4 °C before use (≤6 h). Cell Cultures—Astrocyte-pure cultures (>99% of GFAP-positive cells) and microglia-pure cultures (>99% cells positive for the Griffonia Simplicifolia isolectin B4) were obtained as described (1Bezzi P. Domercq M. Brambilla L. Galli R. Schols D. De Clercq E. Vescovi A. Bagetta G. Kollias G. Meldolesi J. Volterra A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of cultured astrocytes from the cerebral cortex of newborn animals were depleted of microglial cells by mechanical shaking and treatment with the microglial toxin l-leucine methyl ester (7.5 mm, 12 h). Free-floating microglia were collected from shaken astrocyte flasks, purified by pre-plating on plastic dishes for 1 h, seeded on 35-mm dishes (300,000 cells/dish), and used in experiments within 12–24 h. Cultures enriched in mature, galactocerebroside-positive oligodendrocytes were obtained by differentiation of the bipotential CG-4 glial precursor cell line as described by Louis and co-workers (39Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Finally, mixed neuron-glia cultures were obtained from embryonic day 16 mouse brains. Hippocampi were dissociated by treatment with trypsin (0.25%) plus DNase (0.05%) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, 15 min, 37 °C). The reaction was stopped with 10% fetal bovine serum followed by gentle mechanical pipetting. Cells were then plated at a density of 3 × 105 onto astrocyte monolayers. Cultures were then grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and N2 (Invitrogen) and treated on day 3 with cytosine arabinoside (5 μm; 24 h) to prevent glial proliferation. In part of the experiments we depleted the neuronal component of the mixed neuron-glia cultures (40Rouach N. Glowinski J. Giaume C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1513-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, at 7 days in vitro, cultures were exposed to N-methyl-d-aspartate (300 μm) for 1 h in a Mg 2+-free medium and utilized 24 h later, after all neurons had died, and debris was removed by several pipette washes. Enzymatic Assay of Endogenous Glutamate Release—Efflux of endogenous glutamate from synaptosomal suspensions, cell cultures, or tissue slices in response to various stimuli was monitored on-line by a specific enzymatic assay, as previously described (1Bezzi P. Domercq M. Brambilla L. Galli R. Schols D. De Clercq E. Vescovi A. Bagetta G. Kollias G. Meldolesi J. Volterra A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 13Bezzi P. Carmignoto G. Pasti L. Vesce S. Rossi D. Rizzini B.L. Pozzan T. Volterra A. Nature. 1998; 391: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Briefly, each type of preparation was lodged in a 1 × 1-cm cuvette (1.3-ml volume: Hellma Italia s.r.l., Italy) inside a LS55 computerized spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C under continuous stirring in a buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 3.1 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 25mm Na-HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2 at pH 7.4 with glutamate dehydrogenase (15.5 units/ml) and 1 mm NADP+. Synaptosomal pellets were resuspended in Krebs buffer and, shortly before the assay, preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with bovine serum albumin (16 μm) to bind any released free fatty acids. Glutamate released from the preparations was immediately oxidized by glutamate dehydrogenase to α-ketoglutarate with formation of NADPH and fluorescence emission at 430 nm (excitation light 335 nm). This procedure allows reliable detection of the glutamate released without important subtraction by re-uptake even in thin slices (41Volterra A. Steinhauser C. Glia. 2004; 47: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Release was quantified referring to standard curves constructed with exogenous glutamate, and values were normalized relative to the total protein content of each sample. Agonists inducing glutamate release were added directly in the cuvette. Agents acting intracellularly, such as 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA/AM), cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT), and bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), required a pretreatment that was usually performed by incubating brain slices in artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 37 °C under constant bubbling with 95% O2, 5% CO2. BAPTA/AM and COX inhibitors were preincubated for 30 min, whereas TeNT required 40 min. The effect of Baf A1 was assessed using two different experimental protocols; hippocampal slices were (a) exposed to the drug for 2 or 6 h in the dark and stimulated with agonists inducing glutamate release at the end of the incubation period or (b) exposed to the drug for 2 h and stimulated 2 times with an agonist (either TNFα or PGE2) at the start and at the end of the incubation period. Immunohistochemistry—Brain hemispheres used for histological analyses were fixed in Carnoy solution (ethanol, chloroform, glacial acetic acid, 6:3:1) and embedded in paraplast. 5-μm-thick serial sections from paraplast-embedded blocks were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, cresyl violet for Nissl substance, and thioflavin S for amyloid. For immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated with a polyclonal antibody to a synthetic peptide homologous to residues 1–40 of human amyloid-β peptide (anti-pan β-amyloid, 1:800, overnight) or a polyclonal antibody against GFAP (1:800, overnight). Before Aβ-immunostaining, the sections were pretreated with guanidine thiocyanate (3 m, 25 °C, 30 min). Immunoreactivity for GFAP was enhanced by pretreatment with 4% formaldehyde solution. Immunoreactions were revealed by Envision system (DAKO, Denmark) for rabbit immunoglobulins using 3–3′-diaminobenzidine as chromogen. The relative area of GFAP immunoreactive structures was measured on the 5-μm-thick sections immunostained with anti-GFAP antibody using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a color video camera (Nikon DMX 1200) and a computer-based image analysis system (Lucia Measurement, Version 4.60, Laboratory Imaging, Czech Republic). After establishing a density threshold, the software calculated the percentage of area occupied by the reaction product by dividing the area of immunopositivity by the total area. Using a 20× objective, we measured 6–8 fields in the hippocampus of 4- and 12-month-old PDAPP and control mice. To quantify the number of astrocytes present in the hippocampus, sections were immunostained with anti-GFAP antibody and visualized with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:400, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Nuclei were subsequently labeled with Hoechst 33342 staining (10 μg/ml, 15 min). Immunopositive cells were counted in 6 different fields per each hippocampus using a 40× objective mounted on Axioskop 40 fluorescence microscope. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from astrocyte-pure cultures using RNeasy Mini kit according to manufacturer's guidelines (Qiagen, Italy). 1 μg of extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed using RETROscript according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion Europe Ltd). 1 μl of the resulting cDNA was amplified using DENN/MADD (sense, 5′-CAGCCCATCCATTATCGAGTC; antisense, 5′-CTCCACTTCACTGGCATCTCCC) and β-actin (sense, 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACAA; antisense, 5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC) primers. Western Blot Analysis—Samples were electrophoresed through 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). DENN/MADD was detected by incubation with 1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-DENN/MADD antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO, 5000-fold dilution in TBST (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% dry milk) at room temperature for 1 h. The immune complex was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce). Membranes were stripped and incubated with an anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Appropriate film exposures were acquired with Versadoc 3000 (Bio-Rad) and quantified with Quantity-One 4.4.1 software. Statistical Analyses—Student's t test was used for comparisons between two groups; one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's F-test was used for post hoc comparisons of multiple groups. Analyses were performed with Statview Version 1.2. TNFα-dependent Glutamate Release in Hippocampal Slices—Previous work in our laboratory established that stimulation of TNFR-1 with TNFα evokes glutamate release from astrocyte-pure cultures via a Ca2+-dependent process that requires the production of PGE2 (1Bezzi P. Domercq M. Brambilla L. Galli R. Schols D. De Clercq E. Vescovi A. Bagetta G. Kollias G. Meldolesi J. Volterra A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Here we show that the cytokine evokes an analogous release from acute hippocampal slices (Fig. 1A) and that such a glutamate release has a non-neuronal, most likely astrocytic origin. First, we directly demonstrate that the soluble cytokine does not evoke glutamate release from nerve terminals. In these experiments we used synaptosomal suspensions prepared from mouse hippocampus. As expected, both [Ca2+]i elevation with the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin (2 μm), and membrane depolarization with high K+(20 mm) elicited a large glutamate release response from the synaptosomes (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, TNFα (30 ng/ml; n = 6) did not induce detectable glutamate release (Fig. 2A). Second, we confirm that TNFα does not elicit detectable glutamate release from neurons by studies in hippocampal cultures. Thus, administration of the cytokine (30 ng/ml) to mixed hippocampal cultures induced a rapid glutamate release response (1.22 ± 0.18 nmol/mg of protein, n = 3), whose extent was identical to the response obtained from the same cultures after selective depletion of the neuronal component (see “Experimental Procedures”; 1.20 ± 0.08 nmol/mg of protein, n = 3). Third, by comparing the glutamate release responses to TNFα in purified cultures of different glial cell types, astrocytes, microglia, or oligodendrocytes (see “Experimental procedures”), we find that the cytokine (30 ng/ml) evokes glutamate release exclusively from astrocytes (1.32 ± 0.2 in nmol/mg of protein from astrocytes; 0.04 ± 0.02 in nmol/mg of protein from microglia; 0.02 ± 0.02 in nmol/mg of protein from oligodendrocytes; n = 4–6 for each cell culture type). Finally, we show that the pharmacological properties of the release processes evoked by TNFα in cultured astrocytes (1Bezzi P. Domercq M. Brambilla L. Galli R. Schols D. De Clercq E. Vescovi A.

https://openalex.org/W2044048780,"Myo1b is a widely expressed myosin-I isoform that concentrates on endosomal and ruffling membranes and is thought to play roles in membrane trafficking and dynamics. Myo1b is alternatively spliced within the regulatory domain of the molecule, yielding isoforms with six (myo1ba), five (myo1bb), or four (myo1bc) non-identical IQ motifs. The calmodulin binding properties of the myo1b IQ motifs have not been investigated, and the mechanical and cell biological consequences of alternative splicing are not known. Therefore, we expressed the alternatively spliced myo1b isoforms truncated after the final IQ motif and included a sequence at their C termini that is a substrate for bacterial biotin ligase. Site-specific biotinylation allows us to specifically attach the myosin to motility surfaces via a biotin-streptavidin linkage. We measured the ATPase and motile properties of the recombinant myo1b splice isoforms, and we correlated these properties with calmodulin binding. We confirmed that calcium-dependent changes in the ATPase activity are due to calcium binding to the calmodulin closest to the motor. We found that calmodulin binds tightly to some of the IQ motifs (Kd < 0.2 μm) and very weakly to the others (Kd > 5 μm), suggesting that a subset of the IQ motifs are not calmodulin bound under physiological conditions. Finally, we found the in vitro motility rate to be dependent on the myo1b isoform and the calmodulin concentration and that the myo1b regulatory domain acts as a rigid lever arm upon calmodulin binding to the high affinity and low affinity IQ motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2053917765,"The appropriate regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for cell movement, changes in cell shape, and formation of membrane protrusions like lamellipodia and filopodia. Moreover, several regulatory proteins affecting actin dynamics have been identified in the motile regions of cells. Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of SPIN90 in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and actin comet tail formation. SPIN90 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in COS-7 cells, but exposing the cells to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) caused a redistribution of SPIN90 to the cell cortex and the formation of lamellipodia (or membrane ruffles), both of which were dramatically inhibited in SPIN90-knockdown cells. In addition, the binding of the C terminus of SPIN90 with both the Arp2/3 complex (actin-related proteins Arp 2 and Arp 3) and G-actin activates the former, leading to actin polymerization <i>in vitro</i>. And when coexpressed with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5 kinase, SPIN90 was observed within actin comet tails. Taken these findings suggest that SPIN90 participates in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and in actin-based cell motility."

The early steps in clavulanic acid biosynthesis leading to the bicyclic β-lactam intermediate (3S,5S)-clavaminic acid have been defined. However, the mechanism by which (3S,5S)-clavaminic acid is converted to the penultimate intermediate (3R,5R)-clavaldehyde is unclear. Disruption of orf15 or orf16, of the clavulanic acid biosynthesis gene cluster, blocks clavulanic acid production and leads to the accumulation of N-acetyl-glycyl-clavaminic acid and N-glycyl-clavaminic acid, suggesting that these compounds are intermediates in the pathway. Two alternative start codons have been proposed for orf17 to encode for two possible polypeptides, one of which has 92 N-terminal residues less then the other. The shorter version of orf17 was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as a monomeric protein. Sequence analyses predicting the ORF17 protein to be a member of the ATP-grasp fold superfamily were supported by soft ionization mass spectrometric analyses that demonstrated binding of ATP to the ORF17 protein. Semisynthetic clavaminic acid, prepared by in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthetic pathway from the synthetically accessible intermediate proclavaminic acid, was shown by mass spectrometric analyses to be converted to N-glycyl-clavaminic acid in the presence of ORF17, ATP, and glycine. Under the same conditions N-acetyl-glycine and clavaminic acid were not converted to N-acetyl-glycyl-clavaminic acid. The specificity of ORF17 as an N-glycyl-clavaminic acid synthetase, together with the reported accumulation of N-glycyl-clavaminic acid in orf15 and orf16 disruption mutants, suggested that N-glycyl-clavaminic acid is an intermediate in clavulanic acid biosynthesis.

The bicyclic β-lactam clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of Class A serine β-lactamases (penicillinases) and is used clinically in combination with semisynthetic penicillins such as amoxicillin (1Brown A.G.

Clavulanic acid is one of a family of clavams produced as secondary metabolites by Streptomyces clavuligerus, but it is unusual among naturally occurring clavams in that it possesses the 3R,5R stereochemistry required for reaction with penicillin-binding proteins and β-lactamases. Although clavulanic acid has only eight carbons and two chiral centers, its lability and density of functionalization renders its preparation via chemical synthesis difficult (2Baggaley K.H.

There has been interest in clavam biosynthesis with a view to optimizing the fermentation of clavulanic acid as well as for engineering the pathway to produce new derivatives with a broad spectrum of antibacterial and β-lactamase inhibitory activities. The clavulanic acid biosynthesis gene cluster in S. clavuligerus is currently thought to comprise ∼18 genes that are directly involved in its biosynthesis, transport, and regulation (Fig. 1a, or fs 2–19) (4Mellado E.

Acylated (3S,5S)-derivatives of clavaminic acid (Fig. 1c), N-acetyl-clavaminic acid, N-acetyl-glycyl-clavaminic acid, and N-glycyl-clavaminic acid have been isolated from a mutant strain of S. clavuligerus deficient in clavulanic acid production (designated dcl8) (33Elson S.W. Gillett J. Nicholson N.H. Tyler J.W. J. Chem. Soc.-Chem. Commun. 1988; : 979-980Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, the latter two of these compounds have been reported in disruption mutants of orf15 and orf16 (32Jensen S.E. Paradkar A.S. Mosher R.H. Anders C. Beatty P.H. Brumlik M.J. Griffin A. Barton B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These compounds have not been observed in disruption mutants of any of the other orfs of the clavulanic acid biosynthetic gene cluster, and the reactions by which they are produced have not been defined. One problem with attempts to define the reactions involved in the biosynthesis of (3R,5R)-clavaldehyde from (3S,5S)-clavaminic acid is the availability of potential substrates with which to challenge candidate enzymes. This problem is common to studies on other biosynthetic pathways leading to many secondary (and some primary) metabolites. Here we have described studies on the latter stages of clavulanic acid biosynthesis in which we approached the problem of a lack of availability of intermediates by utilizing the activity of characterized recombinant enzymes coupled to accessible synthetic intermediates. The results revealed that ORF17 can catalyze the biosynthesis of N-glycyl-clavaminic acid from clavaminic acid in an ATP-dependent manner, supporting the proposal that N-glycyl-clavaminic acid is an intermediate in the clavulanic acid biosynthesis pathway. Materials—Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma. DNA manipulations were carried out by standard protocols (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by SigmaGenosys Ltd. Expression vectors were purchased from Novagen. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. LC-MS Analyses—The LC-MS system comprised a Waters 600 controller pump with a Waters 2700 sample manager in combination with a Micromass ZMD mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). MassLynx version 3.5 was used for data analysis and processing. The following high performance liquid chromatography columns were used: C18 (150 × 4.60 mm, 5μ) reversephase column (LUNA 5μ C18 (2Baggaley K.H. Brown A.G. Schofield C.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1997; 14: 309-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) 100A, Phenomenex). C18 octadecylsilyl guard cartridges (SecurityGuard, Phenomenex) were used throughout and replaced as required. The method was modified from Jensen et al. (32Jensen S.E. Paradkar A.S. Mosher R.H. Anders C. Beatty P.H. Brumlik M.J. Griffin A. Barton B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Samples were eluted with a gradient from 5 to 30% acetonitrile in 100 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.0, at a flow rate of 1 ml·min–1 over 15 min followed by a wash of 30% acetonitrile in 100 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.0, for 10 min before the column was re-equilibrated to 5% acetonitrile in 100 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.0, over 5 min. The production of clavams was also monitored by imidazole-derivatization as described previously (35Foulstone M. Reading C. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1982; 22: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), using LC-MS analysis on a LUNA C18 reverse-phase column. Sequence Analysis and Modeling—Homologous polypeptide sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base, using the search programs Position Specific Iterated–Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST) and Conserved Domain Database (CCD) (36Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59413) Google Scholar). The initial multiple alignments of complete sequences were performed using T-coffee (37Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5398) Google Scholar) and then manually adjusted to maximize sequence conservation with GeneDoc (38Nicholas K.B. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Deerfield II, D.W. EMBNEW. NEWS. 1997; 4: 14Google Scholar). Structural homologs to ORF17 were obtained using the search program 3D-PSSM (three-dimensional position-specific scoring matrix) (39Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.E J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Based on these results, the structure of biotin carboxylase (1DV2) (40Thoden J.B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16183-16190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was selected to build a sequence-based structural model of ORF17 using MODELLER (41Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10446) Google Scholar). The program Swiss-pdb Viewer (42Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9503) Google Scholar) was used to superimpose biotin carboxylase complexed with ATP (1DV2) (43Fan C. Park I.S. Walsh C.T. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2531-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the ORF17 model. PYMOL was used for visual analysis and rendering of Fig. 2b (44DeLano W.L. Drug Discovery Today. 2005; 10: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cloning of the Two Proposed Versions of orf17—Two orf17 sequences have been proposed, differing in length by 92 amino acids. Both the short (32Jensen S.E. Paradkar A.S. Mosher R.H. Anders C. Beatty P.H. Brumlik M.J. Griffin A. Barton B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the long (4Mellado E. Lorenzana L.M. Rodriguez-Saiz M. Diez B. Liras P. Barredo J.L. Microbiology (Reading). 2002; 148: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) forms of the orf17 gene were amplified by PCR from wild-type S. clavuligerus genomic DNA. Both versions were cloned directly into the pET24a(+) vector (Novagen) as an NdeI/BamHI fragment. The primers used for the short version of orf17 were: forward, 5′-ggtggtcatatgaccacacccc-3′; reverse, 5′-ggtggtggatcctcacgactccc-3′. The primers used for the long version of orf17 were: forward, 5′-ggtggtcatatgacccccggggcc-3′; reverse, 5′-ggtggtggatcctcacgactccc-3′. The shorter version of orf17 was also cloned into the pET28a(+) vector as an NdeI/BamHI fragment (primers as above); this produced protein with a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal His tag. It was also cloned, as an NdeI/XhoI fragment, into the pET24a(+) vector (Novagen) to produce a construct encoding for ORF17 with a C-terminal His tag; the primers used are forward, 5′-ggtggtcatatgaccacacccc-3′ and reverse, 5′-ggtggtctcgagcgactccccgccccgctcgcc-3′. Expression and Purification of C-terminal His-tagged ORF17 (Short Form)—Orf17/pET24a(+) (short form) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent cells and grown at 37 °C in 2TY medium containing 30 μg·ml–1 kanamycin to an A600 of 0.8. The temperature was reduced to 15 °C, and expression of orf17 was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Growth was continued for a further 18 h at 15 °C. C-terminal His-tagged ORF17 was purified by sequential use of affinity chromatography (His·Bind® resin, Novagen) and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S75, Amersham Biosciences) yielding C-terminal His-tagged ORF17 of >95% purity by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3, lane 4 against SeeBlue® Plus2 pre-stained standard, Invitrogen). Native Molecular Mass Determination—The molecular mass of ORF17 was estimated by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 HR, 10/300). Calibration was carried out using cytochrome C (12 kDa), chymotrypsin (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and blue dextran (2000 kDa). An elution volume parameter (Kav) was calculated for each of the calibration proteins, and a calibration curve was constructed. Mass Spectrometric Analyses—For molecular weight determination of ORF17, ESI-MS was performed using a VG Platform II spectrometer with Agilent 1100 series pump and auto-sampler. ORF17 samples were prepared in 1:1 water-acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid with a final protein concentration of 10 μm. Soft ESI-MS was preformed on a quadrupole time-of-flight micro with collisional cooling (Micromass UK Ltd., Altrincham, UK). ORF17 samples were prepared in 50 mm ammonium acetate with a final protein concentration of 2 μm. A 20-fold excess of ATP was added to a final protein concentration of 2 μm in 50 mm ammonium acetate. The capillary voltage was set to 3 kV, and the sample cone voltage and extractor cone voltage were changed to 120 and 20 kV, respectively. ORF17 Activity Assays—The rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured at 25 °C by coupling the production of ADP to pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase while monitoring the loss of NADH at 340 nm (45Cooper R.A. Kornberg H.L. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 309-314Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 46Penefsky H.S. Bruist M.F. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 4.

The final reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, varying amounts of ATP (0.1–4.0 mm), 0.7 units of pyruvate kinase, and 1 unit of lactate dehydrogenase (10 μl of stock pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle solution), and the assay was initiated by the addition of 80 μg of ORF17 in a final volume of 1 ml. The release of inorganic phosphate from the hydrolysis of ATP, by ORF17, was confirmed using the EnzChek® phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes). ORF17 assays were carried out, in the same manner, using the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase ATPase assay (45Cooper R.A. Kornberg H.L.

A typical coupled enzyme incubation mixture contained 150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 12 μm CEAS, BLS, PAH, and CAS2 with appropriate cofactors (30 mm d/l-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 1.5 mm thiamin diphosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm FeSO4, and 10 mm 2-OG) and substrates (30 mm l-arginine or 10 mm deoxyguanidinoproclavaminic acid), in a final volume of 100 μl. The assay mixtures were incubated at 30 °C in a water bath for 1 h, and the reaction was then stopped by heating for 2 min at 100 °C. Protein was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was stored at –80 °C before LC-MS analysis on a LUNA C18 reverse-phase column. Controls were conducted in the absence of enzyme(s). Coupled CAS2/ORF17 Activity Assay—The CAS2 assay was modified from that reported by Lloyd et al. (24Lloyd M.D. Merritt K.D. Lee V. Sewell T.J.

The assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C in a water bath. After 20 min, more FeSO4 and dithiothreitol (10 μl of a 10 mm stock of each) were added. After 40 min, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min, to remove any precipitate, and the supernatant was filtered through a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. 25 μl of the CAS2-free filtrate was then combined with a buffer solution of 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm ATP, 2 mm glycine, or alternative potential substrates, and the assay was initiated by the addition of 80 μg of ORF17 in a final volume of 50 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 30 min before the reaction was stopped by the addition of acetone (120 μl). After centrifugation, the acetone was removed in vacuo (using a Speed-Vac SC110, Savant), and the mixture was then analyzed by LC-MS. This assay and substrate specificity assays were also conducted using the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase ATPase assay (45Cooper R.A. Kornberg H.L.

In this work we reported the solution structure of the first FF domain of Prp40 and the identification of a novel ligand-binding site in FF domains. By using chemical shift assays, we found a binding site for the N-terminal crooked neck tetratricopeptide repeat of Clf1 that is distinct and structurally separate from the previously identified CTD-RNAPII binding pocket of the FBP11 (formin-binding protein 11) FF1 domain. No interaction, however, was observed between the Prp40 FF1 domain and three different peptides derived from the CTD-RNAPII protein. Indeed, the equivalent CTD-RNAPII-binding site in the Prp40 FF1 domain is predominantly negatively charged and thus unfavorable for an interaction with phosphorylated peptide sequences. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree reconstructions using the FF domains of three functionally related proteins, Prp40, FBP11, and CA150, revealed that Prp40 and FBP11 are not orthologous proteins and supported the different ligand specificities shown by their respective FF1 domains. Our results also revealed that not all FF domains in Prp40 are functionally equivalent. We proposed that at least two different interaction surfaces exist in FF domains that have evolved to recognize distinct binding motifs.

Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar). In the early stages of spliceosome assembly, the splicing factor Prp40 associates with the U1 snRNP and plays an important role in bringing the 5′ and the 3′ splice sites into spatial proximity (2Abovich N. Rosbach M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Prp40 is a modular protein consisting of an N-terminal WW domain pair followed by several FF domains. Although the Prp40 WW domains bind to proline-rich sequences in the branch point-binding protein and the U5 snRNP-associated protein Prp8 (2Abovich N. Rosbach M.

FF domains were first identified in the murine splicing factor FBP11 (formin-binding protein 11) as a repeated sequence of about 60 amino acids containing two conserved phenylalanine (F) residues that give name to the domain (9Bedford M.T. Leder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 264-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although protein-interaction modules are commonly found in functionally unrelated proteins, FF domains are primarily present in only the following three protein families: the splicing factors FBP11 and Prp40, the transcription factor CA150, and p190 RhoGTPase-related proteins (9Bedford M.T. Leder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 264-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). With only few exceptions, FF domains are arranged in arrays of up to six domains that in the case of CA150 seem to create multiple independent binding sites, rather than to confer binding cooperativity (10Smith M.J. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9274-9285Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, Prp40, FBP11, and CA150 have all been shown to recognize phospho-CTD repeats through their FF domains (11Carty S.M. Goldstrohm A.C. Sune C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9015-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Some progress has been made to understand how FF domains recognize phosphorylated ligands. In this respect, the solution structure of the N-terminal FF domain (FF1) of the human Huntingtin yeast partner (HYPA)/FBP11 has shown that the FF domain fold consists of three α-helices arranged as an orthogonal bundle and a 310 helix in the loop connecting the second and the third helix (12Allen M. Friedler A. Schon O. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). By using chemical shift perturbation experiments, Bycroft and co-workers (12Allen M. Friedler A. Schon O. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were able to identify the binding site of HYPA/FBP11 FF1 domain for a peptide corresponding to two doubly phosphorylated RNAPII CTD repeats, leading to the suggestion that FF domains may represent a new class of phosphopeptide-binding modules. Most significantly, the phospho-ligand recognition site described for the HYPA/FBP11 FF1 domain is only conserved in a particular subset of FF sequences, indicating that different binding motifs may exist for other FF domains. For the splicing factor Prp40, previous studies have shown that a region including its first FF domain interacts with the protein Clf1. Clf1/Syf3p is an essential and well conserved multifunctional protein involved in cell cycle progression, pre-mRNA splicing, and initiation of DNA replication in yeast (5Chung S. McLean M.R. Rymond B.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1042-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Vincent K. Wang Q. Jay S. Hobbs K. Rymond B.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7875-7883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Clf1 is composed of 15 crooked neck-like tetratricopeptide repeats (crn-TPR) (5Chung S. McLean M.R. Rymond B.C. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1042-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Vincent K. Wang Q. Jay S. Hobbs K. Rymond B.C.

TPR motifs represent a class of ubiquitous protein-interaction modules of partially conserved sequence. Although some RNAPII CTD heptapeptides form β-turns at the central SPTS motif in the presence of the target protein (14Fabrega C. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1549-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Meinhart A. Cramer P.

Biol. 2005; 12: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and others adopt an extended conformation (17Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), TPR motifs in general fold as a pair of anti-parallel α-helices. Repeats of TPR motifs often assemble into right-handed helical superstructures creating extensive binding surfaces with diverse specificities (18D'Andrea L.D. Rega L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to the RNAPII CTD, phosphorylation does not seem to occur in TPR motifs. The diversity in not only the function but also in the structure of these Prp40 FF domain binding partners raises important questions as to whether distinct binding specificities exist in FF domains and how the FF domain fold enables this potential promiscuity in ligand binding. To gain more insight into the interaction mode of FF domains, we have determined the solution structure of the first FF domain of Prp40, and we characterized its interaction with the first crn-TPR motif (crn-TPR1) of Clf1 by chemical shift perturbation experiments. Most interestingly, the interaction surfaces of the Prp40 and HYPA/FBP11 FF1 domains are adjacent but structurally separate. NMR binding studies with the Prp40 FF1 domain using phosphorylated and unphosphorylated RNAPII CTD repeats revealed no interaction. Furthermore, no interaction was observed between the C-terminal FF domain (FF4) of Prp40 and the Clf1 crn-TPR1 motif showing that not all FF domains in the splicing factor Prp40 are functionally equivalent. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic reconstructions using the FF domains of Prp40, HYPA/FBP11, and CA150 proteins reveal that Prp40 and HYPA/FBP11 are not orthologous proteins and support the different ligand specificities shown by their respective FF1 domains. Taken together, at least two spatially separate interaction surfaces seem to exist in FF domains that recognize distinct binding motifs. Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Tree Reconstructions—Sequence alignments were performed using T-Coffee (19Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5336) Google Scholar). For initial alignments, all predicted FF domain sequences in the literature (8Morris D.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39935-39943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and those found in data bases, such as smart.embl-heidelberg.de and www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam, were used. After an initial alignment, FF domains that did not satisfy our confidence level were manually removed resulting in the final alignment (see supplemental Fig. 1). Proteins annotated in data bases as hypothetical were classified by domain architecture and length of the linkers connecting the WW domains as follows: proteins containing two WW domains separated by a short (∼15 aa) conserved linker were initially classified as similar to FBP11 proteins, whereas proteins with two or more WW domains separated by long, variable linkers were categorized as CA150-related. Because in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe there is only a unique Prp40 protein, whereas all remaining organisms contain at least one CA150-type (transcription factor) and one FBP11-type (splicing factor) protein, independence of the Prp40 subclass was maintained for the analysis. As sequence identity between equivalent FF domains within each of the three protein families is higher than 75%, two, three, and four representative protein sequences were selected from Prp40, CA150, and FBP11 proteins, respectively, for sequence alignment. Phylogenetic trees were generated with Phylip 3.5 based on the previous alignment. The protdist program was used to compute distance matrices from protein sequences employing the Dayhoff PAM matrix and neighbor programs. The final tree is shown in Fig. 5A. The SwissProt/UniProt accession numbers of the protein sequences are as follows: CG3542, Drosophila melanogaster FBP11; Q90WG3, Gallus gallus FBP11 (formin-binding protein 11-related protein). The FF domain-containing region is identical to human protein FNB3_HUMAN (Huntingtin yeast partner A/Huntingtin-interacting protein HYPA/FBP11), and because of this we named the sequence as Hs/Gg HYPA/FBP11; Q6NWY9, Homo sapiens HYPC/FBP11 (Huntingtin-interacting protein C/formin-binding protein 11-related protein); Q8IEF0, Plasmodium falciparum FBP11; O14776, H. sapiens CA150; Q86MP, Caenorhabditis elegans CA150; Q7PMV0, Anopheles gambiae CA150; O14176, S. pombe Prp40; and P33203, S. cerevisiae Prp40. Sample Preparation—DNA fragments encoding the respective FF domains and TPR motifs were amplified by PCR using genomic S. cerevisiae DNA as template. FF domain constructs correspond to residues 134-189 (FF1) and 121-189 (extended FF1), to residues 488-552 and 465-552 (FF4 and extended FF4) of Prp40, and to residues 212-266 of Ypr152. Protein constructs of TPR motifs correspond to residues 31-64 and 1-64 (crn-TPR1 and extended crn-TPR1) of Clf1. The gene fragments were inserted into a modified pET24d vector (G. Stier, EMBL Heidelberg, Germany) enabling production of the N-terminal fusion protein with a His tag followed by glutathione S-transferase and a TEV protease cleavage site. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified in three steps. After affinity purification with glutathione-Sepharose, the fusion protein was subsequently cleaved with an N-His-tagged TEV protease, and both the protease and the glutathione S-transferase proteins were separated from the domain by a Ni2+-chelation step and gel filtration chromatography. Protein purity was determined by SDS-PAGE. All constructs contain two to four additional residues (GA, GAM, and GAMD) preceding the domain that result from primer design and the TEV cleavage site. To prepare 13C- and/or 15N-labeled samples, cells were grown in minimal medium (M9) with d-[13C]glucose and/or 15NH4Cl as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively. NMR samples of the Prp40 FF1 domain and Clf1 crn-TPR1 motif had a protein concentration of ∼1 mm for structure determination and were dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 in 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 100% D2O at pH 6.2. NMR Spectroscopy—Except for chemical shift perturbation experiments, all NMR data were collected at 285 K for the Prp40 FF1 domain and at 295 K for the Clf1 crn-TPR1 motif on Bruker DRX-500, DRX-600, and DRX-800 NMR spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance z-gradient probes. All spectra were processed with the NMRPipe/NMRDraw package (20Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11279) Google Scholar) and were analyzed with XEASY (21Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar), whereas 15N relaxation data were analyzed using NMRView (22Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts were assigned by standard methods (23Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1363) Google Scholar) using 1H, 15N-HSQC, HNCA, CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, HNHα-J experiments for backbone assignments and 1H-13C-CT-HSQC, HC(CO)NH-, C(CO)NH- and HC(C)H-TOCSY experiments for aliphatic side chain assignments. For the Prp40 FF1 domain, aromatic side chain assignments were achieved using two-dimensional (Hβ)Cβ(CγCδ)Hδ and (Hβ)Cβ(CγCδCϵ)Hϵ experiments (24Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11054-11055Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar), two-dimensional homonuclear 1H-TOCSY and NOESY, and three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY experiments, whereas the three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY was sufficient to assign aromatic side chains in the Clf1 crn-TPR1 motif. Heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE experiments were recorded at 500.13-MHz proton frequency by standard two-dimensional methods (25Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) using a 1.0 mm15N-labeled sample. The heteronuclear NOE experiments were run twice in an interleaved fashion with and without (reference experiment) proton saturation during the recovery delay. Errors in the peak intensities were estimated from the average base-line noise in the spectra of repeated experiments. {1H}-15N NOEs were determined as the peak intensity ratio between the reference and the saturation experiment and are the average of two measurements. Structure Calculation—Inter-proton distance restraints were derived from fully assigned peaks in three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOE experiments (using mixing times of 140 ms) integrated with the XEASY package. Hydrogen bond restraints were applied as indicated by 3J(HN,Hα) coupling constants, 13Cα and 13Cβ secondary chemical shifts, and NOE patterns. Restraints for the backbone angles ϕ and Ψ were derived from the program TALOS (26Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar) and were applied where they agreed with the experimental ϕ angles determined by quantitative 3J(HN,Hα) correlation experiments (27Kubinowa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). For the dihedral angles predicted by TALOS, the upper and lower restraint boundaries were doubled as compared with those suggested by the program. 3J(N,Cγ) coupling constants were measured by spin-echo difference experiments (28Hu J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to restrain the side chain angle χ1 to 180 ± 40° for trans-rotamers and to 0 ± 90° for gauche-rotamers. For structure calculation the programs CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

Structures were calculated in 8 iterations producing 30 structures in each of the first 7 iterations and 50 structures in the final iteration. The 20 lowest energy structures of the final iteration were submitted to water refinement. The quality of the 10 lowest energy structures was analyzed after water refinement using the programs CNS and PROCHECK-NMR (32Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J.

Equilibrium was achieved at 55000 rpm after 12 h on a Ti60 rotor. Curves were fitted with the ULTRASCAN software to a monomer-dimer equilibrium profile (see supplemental Fig. 4). Models of the crn-TPR Motif—These models were generated with InsightII using the NMR data to define the boundaries of the helices and their relative orientation (see supplemental Fig. 5). Available structures of TPR motifs were not used as templates to generate the model because the crn-TPR motif used in this work is quite divergent with respect to the canonical TPR repeats characterized so far. In them, the packing of both helices is normally stabilized by contacts between the highly conserved residues WXXXGXXL from the first helix that form a hydrophobic pocket and the side chain of a conserved aromatic residue of the second helix that fits into the pocket. In the case of the crn-TPR1 repeat, the equivalent positions of Trp and Gly are occupied by an Asn and a Glu, respectively, unlikely to form the classical cavity. As such, models that would have been generated only by sequence homology would have given an orientation of the helices different from the one obtained in this work, which is based on NOE data. Chemical Shift Mapping Experiments—Chemical shift perturbation experiments with the 15N-labeled Prp40 FF1 domain and unlabeled Clf1 crn-TPR1 were performed at 600-MHz proton frequency on a Bruker DRX-600 NMR spectrometer at 295 K using two-dimensional 1H,15N-HSQC experiments. All samples were dissolved in the same NMR buffer as described above. The 15N-labeled proteins were 0.5 mm in concentration. Unlabeled Clf1 crn-TPR1 was added to the 15N-labeled Prp40 FF1 domain to a final molar ligand:protein ratio of ∼2:1. As a control experiment unlabeled Clf1 TPR1 was added to the 15N-labeled C-terminal FF4 domain of Prp40 to a final molar ratio of ∼3:1 (data not shown). For binding studies with the 15N-labeled Prp40 FF1 domain and peptides derived from the RNAPII CTD, a synthetic doubly phosphorylated CTD repeat with the sequence SYpSPTpSPS (where pS indicates phosphoserine) and an unphosphorylated CTD repeat with the sequence (YSPTSPS)2 were purchased from MWG Biotec AG (Ebersberg, Germany). A (YpSPTpSPS)2 peptide was synthesized in-house by using the Fmoc strategy. The Fmoc-Ser(PO(benzyloxy)OH)-OH amino acid was purchased from Novabiochem. The final peptide was cleaved with 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% H2O and precipitated in cold ether. The crude material was purified by preparative HPLC to 90% purity (as characterized by HPLC-MS). The peptides were added to the 15N-labeled Prp40 FF1 domain up to a molar peptide:protein ratio of ∼7:1. The NMR data corresponding to the (YpSPTpSPS)2 titration were acquired on a Bruker DRX-800 NMR spectrometer (see supplemental Fig. 6). Average chemical shift changes upon ligand binding were calculated with the equation Δδav = ((Δδ)1H)2 + (Δδ15N/n)2)1/2, where Δδ1H and Δδ15N are the linear change along the 1H and 15N axes, respectively, and n is the ratio of the chemical shift dispersion in 15N and 1H. Chemical shift perturbations were determined to be significant if they were >0.2 ppm. Affinity Measurements—The dissociation constant of the Prp40 FF1-Clf1 TPR1 complex was determined as 150 ± 20 μm by fluorescence spectroscopy, titrating a 60 μm solution of the Prp40 FF1 domain with a 1.1 mm solution of the Clf1 crn-TPR motif. Both samples were used in the same buffer as for the NMR experiments. The temperature was set to 295 K to avoid dimerization of the ligand. The excitation wavelength was 297 nm. Changes in the intensity of the fluorescence signal upon addition of the ligand at 343 nm were used for calculating the dissociation constant. Homology Models—FF2 homology models were generated using MODELLER6.1 (33Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) based on the sequence alignment shown in supplemental Fig. 1, the lowest energy structure of the Prp40 FF1 domain and the solution structure of the HYPA/FBP11 FF1 domain (Protein Data Bank entry 1uzc). Other Methods—Figures of three-dimensional structures and surface representations were prepared with MOLMOL (34Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar). Solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated using NACCESS (35Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS Computer Program. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College, London, UK1993Google Scholar). NMR data were represented using XW in Plot, version 3.1. Prp40 FF1 Domain Boundaries—Because sequence alignments produced consistent domain boundaries for the N- and the C-terminal Prp40 FF domain (hereafter referred to as FF1 and FF4, respectively (8Morris D.P.

Tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are critical components of eukaryotic signaling. The superfamily of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) 2The abbreviations used are: PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; HPTP-A and -B, human red cell low molecular weight PTPase A and B isoenzymes; LMW PTPase, low molecular weight phosphotyrosyl phosphatase; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; EGFP, epidermal growth factor protein; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. is defined in part by a canonical CX5R(S/T) active site motif (P-loop), and can be divided into families based on substrate specificity and protein size (1Alonso A.

Mustelin T. Cell. 2004; 117: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar), the receptor-like PTPases such as CD45 (4Dahlke M.H. Larsen S.R. Rasko J.E.J. Schlitt H.J. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2004; 45: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and non-receptor PTPases such as PTP1B (5Tonks N.K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) are subdivisions of the class I Cys-based family, multidomain proteins where the canonical phosphatase domain is roughly 30 kDa. The low molecular weight (LMW) PTPase, a soluble 18-kDa protein with essentially no sequence similarity to the other families beyond the active site P-loop (6Raugei G. Ramponi G. Chiarugi P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), is the only member of the class II Cys-based family. Two isoenzyme forms of the LMW PTPase are expressed in humans, HPTP-A and HPTP-B, identical in sequence except for an mRNA splice variant sequence corresponding to residues 40–73 (7Wo Y.-Y.P.

Although all PTPases are thought to have the same basic mechanism, the families show marked differences in substrate specificity and small molecule modulation. Within the class II family those differences can be sorted into either an HPTP-A or HPTP-B type response. Both isoenzyme forms have been isolated from rat, chicken, Xenopus laevis, and Drosophila (8Park E.K. Warner N. Mood K. Pawson T. Daar I.O. Mol. Cell.

Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15601-15609Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, yeast, and bovine enzymes are similar to HPTP-B (15Modesti A.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2175-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The human isoenzymes exhibit a dramatically different response to a variety of purine molecules (19Dissing J. Rangaard B. Christensen U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Wang S. Stauffacher C.V. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1234-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In particular, adenine has been shown to inhibit HPTP-A and activate HPTP-B, whereas hypoxanthine activates HPTP-A with little to no effect on HPTP-B. It has also been reported that the rat isoenzyme ACP2 is activated 900% by cGMP, whereas the activity of isoenzyme ACP1 is unchanged (21Cirri P. Caselli A. Manao G. Camici G. Polidori R. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1243: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Adenine has been co-crystallized with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae LMW PTPase, and the structure suggests a basis for HPTP-B activation (20Wang S. Stauffacher C.V. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1234-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The adenine binds near the top of the active site and helps position a water molecule to attack the covalent cysteine intermediate, accelerating the rate-limiting step, which is the release of phosphate from the enzyme. This mode of activation may be extended to explain the effect of hypoxanthine on HPTP-A and cGMP on rat ACP2, but does not explain the negligible or inhibitory effect of these compounds on the alternate isoenzyme. Nonetheless, these subtle differences might be exploited to develop inhibitors that specifically target either isoform. Several reports in the literature have suggested that the LMW PTPase family has oncogenic relevance because overexpression of the A isoform of LMW PTPase is sufficient to transform epithelial cells (22Kikawa K.D. Vidale D.R. Van Etten R.L. Kinch M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39274-39279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This, coupled with the modulation effects seen with purines, encouraged us to pursue a course of rational inhibitor design (23Zabell A.P.R. Corden S. Helquist P. Stauffacher C.V. Wiest O. Bioorgan. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 1867-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In an effort to design both isoenzyme and family-specific inhibitors, it is necessary to have high resolution structures of both human forms of the enzyme. We describe in this report the structure of HPTP-B at 1.6-Å resolution, the highest reported resolution for a LMW PTPase to date. A packing arrangement unseen in previous LMW PTPase structures intercalates a pair of cationic residues in the active site pocket. This structure provides a unique opportunity to revisit the question of substrate specificity and further examine the structural parameters for the design of LMW PTPase inhibitors. To that end, kinetic parameters for both of the HPTP isoenzymes have been determined with a variety of substrates and inhibitors, along with a mutational analysis of the role that three variant residues in the two isoforms have in cGMP activation. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Wild-type Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—Cloning, expression, and purification of HPTP-A and HPTP-B were performed as previously described (7Wo Y.-Y.P. McCormack A.L. Shabanowitz J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Analysis of purity by SDS-PAGE showed two impurities of lower molecular weight for the A isoform and three for the B isoform. These fragments are the result of Asp-Pro bond cleavage (25Lin D. Mechanistic Studies of the Inactivation of Low Molecular Weight Tyrosine Phosphatase. Purdue University, 2000Google Scholar, 26Kishiyama A. Zhang Z. Henzel W.J. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 5431-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 27Ségalas I. Thai R. Ménez R. Vita C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and appear because of heating the sample prior to loading the gel. Unboiled samples did not show these bands (data not shown). HPTP-B was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and dialyzed into nanopurified water prior to all crystallization trials. Fine needle clusters appeared consistently across a relatively broad range of conditions, so variations in drop size and well-to-protein ratio were examined to produce diffraction quality crystals. Spontaneous overnight growth of small distinct plates (0.1 × 0.04 × 0.02 mm) was eventually obtained in a 6-μl hanging drop using 0.5 μl of the concentrated HPTP-B and 5.5 μl of a well solution consisting of 100 mm MES at pH 6.5 with 30% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (Mr 5000) and 50 mm (NH4)2SO4. Individual crystals were mounted in a cryoloop and flash frozen in liquid N2 after a 10-s soak in a cryoprotectant solution of 90% well solution, 10% glycerol. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of HPTP-B Mutant Proteins—Mutant proteins were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) of the wild-type HPTP-B coding sequence (7Wo Y.-Y.P. McCormack A.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Davis J.P. Mitchell G.L. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10856-10865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments of ∼550 bp containing the HPTP-B gene were digested from the original pET vector and subcloned into the corresponding sites of the bacteriophage M13mp18. Mutagenesis was performed using a Mutagene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit from Bio-Rad. A StyI restriction site was engineered into each mutagenic primer to facilitate initial screening. The mutant gene was digested using NcoI-BamHI restriction enzymes and subcloned into the pET-11d expression vector. The ligation mixture was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain DH5α, and individual colonies were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used for overexpression of the mutant proteins. Expression and purification of the mutant B-W49Y was accomplished by the standard LMW PTPase two-step purification scheme (24Davis J.P. Zhou M.-M. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For B-N50E, B-R53N, and B-W49Y/N50E the first step of the purification scheme used a hydrophobic interaction chromatography column. The lysate was loaded onto the hydrophobic interaction chromatography column using 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4, after which the salt concentration was gradually reduced. The protein was eluted using 0.5 m (NH4)2SO4 buffer. The protein was further purified using size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-50 as in the standard scheme. Yields for all mutants were at least 20 mg of protein per liter of culture. Data Collection and Structure Refinement—Initial data collection was done on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode x-ray generator with an R-AxisIV++image plate detector. The preliminary refinement indicated a highly ordered crystal that diffracted to 2.0 Å. To maximize the number of observable reflections, high resolution data were collected on the ID19D beamline at the Advanced Photon Source at 100 K and the frames were indexed and integrated using HKL2000 (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38605) Google Scholar). HPTP-B crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 31.3 Å, b = 35.5 Å, c = 60.4 Å, and β = 100.0° and diffracted to 1.62 Å. Structure determination was performed with elements of the CCP4 package (30Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19796) Google Scholar, 31Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement was performed using MOL-REP (32Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4173) Google Scholar) and the full coordinates for HPTP-A (Protein Data Bank code 5PNT (33Zhang M. Stauffacher C.V. Lin D. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21714-21720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) as the search model to find initial phases. The R-factor for this initial solution was 40.2%. The final structure was established after eight cycles of manual adjustment followed by refinement using Refmac5.2 (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Acta Cryststallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13910) Google Scholar) with an Rwork of 15.8% and an Rfree of 21.5%. Water molecules were added using Refmac starting with the second round of refinement, deleting by hand those with high B factors or unassociated with the enzyme. A glycerol molecule was fit to a portion of density in the 2Fo - Fc map not sufficiently explained by water. Starting with the sixth round of refinement, 10 residues were built with half-occupancy in two conformations. In each case, multiple rotamers were assigned only to those residues that exhibited reasonable density in each position as measured with a 2Fo - Fc map, but also showed some negative density at 3σ in the Fo - Fc map for any one rotamer at full occupancy and positive density at 3σ for the position of the other rotamer. The final refined model of HPTP-B contains 157 amino acids, 139 water molecules, one sulfate ion, and one glycerol molecule. As measured using Procheck (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), HPTP-B has no outliers in the Ramachandran plot and 94% of the residues are in the most favored regions. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (36Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N.

Phosphatase activity was measured as described previously (17Zhang Z.Y. Van Etten R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), with 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as substrate. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance measurement using extinction coefficients calculated by the ProtParam tool from the ExPASy website (37Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (3543) Google Scholar). Steady State Kinetics—Michaelis-Menten parameters for wild-type and mutant proteins were determined using pNPP and phosphotyrosine in sodium acetate buffer. Reactions were performed in triplicate in a volume of 400 μl with 10 different substrate concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 Km (Michaelis constant, substrate concentration at one-half Vmax). The amount of p-nitrophenolate produced after quenching in strong base was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm as described previously (24Davis J.P. Zhou M.-M. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For phosphotyrosine, the reactions were quenched after 4 min by adding 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by the addition of a 500-μl mixture composed of 200 μl of 2% ammonium molybdate and 300 μl of 14% ascorbic acid in 50% trichloroacetic acid. A 1-ml aliquot of 2% trisodium citrate and 2% sodium arsenite in 2% acetic acid was then immediately added. The resulting blue phosphomolybdate complex was developed for 10 min, and the absorption at 700 nm was measured (38Black M.J. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For both assays, the values were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the computer program Scientist (MicroMath, Inc.). Inhibition and Activation Studies—Inhibition constants for HEPES, inorganic phosphate, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), vanadate, and ZnCl2 were determined at five different pNPP concentrations (0.1–5 Km). At each substrate concentration, 10 different inhibitor concentrations were used to determine the initial velocity. A plot of 1/V versus 〈I 〉 was made, and the Ki (inhibition constant) value determined from the point where all lines intersected in the second quadrant (39Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). The cGMP activation studies were performed under the same conditions as the inhibitor studies at a fixed concentration of pNPP (10 mm). Ten different cGMP concentrations were used, ranging from 0 to 2.4 mm. Reactions were quenched after 4 min and performed in duplicate. The data were fit to Equation 1 where Vm′ is the maximal activity at saturation, M is the cGMP concentration, and Ka′ is the apparent activation constant as shown in the equation.ν=100+Vm'[M]Ka'+[M](Eq. 1) Peptide Substrate Studies—A selection of peptides (Table 2) was examined for substrate specificity against both isoenzyme forms by analogy to previous studies done with PTP1B (40Zhang Z.-Y. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4446-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 41Vetter S.W.

Caselli A. Bucciantini M. Pazzagli L. Dolfi F. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 43Bucciantini M. Stefani M. Taddei N. Chiti F. Rigacci S. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The PTP1B study showed that class I PTPs have a preference for sequences with anionic residues preceding the phosphotyrosine, whereas the rat isoenzyme study suggested the class II HPTP-B-like PTPs prefer hydrophobic residues to precede the phosphotyrosine. The AA series of phosphopeptides were synthesized at the Purdue University Protein Separation and Analysis Facility, whereas the remaining phosphopeptides were a generous gift from Dr. Chidambaran Ramachandran, Merck Sharp and Dohme. Phosphopeptide kinetics were conducted at 37 °C in 100 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 7.0, with the ionic strength adjusted to 150 mm with NaCl. For each peptide, six concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 mm were prepared to a final volume of 45 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of either isoenzyme at a concentration of 0.045 mg/ml except for the peptide B38, which required an enzyme concentration of 0.7 mg/ml. Reactions were run for 6 min in all cases except for experiments with the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) peptides, where the reactions were run for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 450 μl of diluted Malachite Green assay reagent (see below) and the reaction was allowed to sit for at least 5 min before measuring absorbance at 620 nm. The phosphate concentration was determined by comparison to a standard curve for sodium phosphate.TABLE 2Isoform activity towards selected peptidesPeptideaPeptide names are based on the source protein: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; B3, band 3; Lck, T-cell specific protein-tyrosine kinase; Syk, spleen tyrosine kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; AA, poly-Ala based peptides.

Biochem. 1983; 135: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) because the increased sensitivity made it possible to minimize peptide use. The Malachite Green assay reagent was prepared by combining 10 ml of Malachite Green dye concentrate (130 mm Malachite Green in 3.6 m sulfuric acid) with 2.5 ml of 7.5% ammonium molybdate and 0.2 ml of 11% Nonidet P-40. Diluted assay reagent was prepared by combining 100 μl of assay reagent with 350 μl of either water or bis-Tris buffer. The assay reagent was prepared daily and remained stable for several hours, whereas the diluted reagent was prepared immediately prior to use. Phosphatase Topology—The overall fold of HPTP-B (Fig. 1) is essentially identical to other LMW PTPase crystal structures with an average Cα root mean square deviation of 0.79 Å. The HPTP-B structure consists of a pair of βαβ motifs, where the four β-strands form a continuous parallel β-sheet flanked on both sides by α-helices. The active site P-loop, residues 12–19, extends from the end of β1 to the start of α1. A 42-residue section between strands β2 and β3 contains two α-helices separated by relatively extended segments. This region forms one side of the active site and contains most of the variable region that distinguishes the HPTP isoenzymes. Following β4 is another extended loop that forms the other side of the active site and leads into a long 16-residue α-helix that ends just before the C terminus. The active site forms a deep pocket in the surface of the enzyme, flanked by aromatic residues at the mouth and the three essential catalytic residues at the base. Two of the catalytic residues are part of the PTPase superfamily signature sequence, CX5R(S/T), in the characteristic P-loop conformation required to position the Cys and Arg for catalytic action. The cysteine accepts the phosphate group from the phosphotyrosine substrate to form the phosphoenzyme intermediate, whereas the arginine side chain and the P-loop backbone amides help position the tetrahedral anion. The third catalytically necessary residue, Asp129, donates a proton to the phenolate anion of the tyrosyl leaving group during the rate-determining step (48Zhang Z. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25947-25950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This aspartic acid is part of the extended loop after β4 and is followed by the tandem tyrosine residues Tyr131 and Tyr132, which form one side of the active site mouth. The other side of the active site is capped by Trp49. Together these three aromatic residues help form a pocket deep enough to prevent catalytic action on phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. Trp49 is also part of the 34-residue variable region distinguishing the A and B isoenzyme forms (7Wo Y.-Y.P. McCormack A.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Davis J.P. Mitchell G.L. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10856-10865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This variable region forms a groove on the enzyme surface that extends from the active site and is thought to contain the residues responsible for the differences in isoenzyme specificity. Residues with Partial Occupancy—At a resolution of 1.6 Å, the structure of HPTP-B affords us the opportunity to determine which rotamers, if any, could be exploited during inhibitor design. Ten residues were found that clearly exist in multiple rotamers. All but one of these residues are at least partially exposed to solvent. The buried residue, Ile77,is surrounded by hydrophobic residues Leu9, Val11, Phe82, Ile88, and Leu99, and the acyl portion of Lys102. Residues Leu29, Asn34, Glu93, and Leu125 are well separated from symmetry-related monomers and the multiple rotamers are likely the result of simple heterogeneity upon exposure to solvent. Other multiple positions are influenced by crystal packing. The two rotamers of Gln105 are both within hydrogen bonding distance of Asp129 on a symmetry related monomer. One rotamer of Lys123 has no intermolecular contacts, whereas the other rotamer forms a hydrogen bond to Ser7 Oγ and Thr84 O of another monomer. Residues Glu37 and His69 face each other in the crystal packing, but fail to form a plausible hydrogen bonding pattern. The van der Waals contacts between the monomers are such that the side chains lie against the monomer surface, preventing an ideal hydrogen bond angle between either of the carboxyl rotamers and either of the histidine rotamers. The most interesting of the multiple rotamers is Arg53 because it is closest to the active site and has been suggested to play a significant role in determining isoenzyme specificity (33Zhang M.

The YdiF protein from Escherichia coli O157:H7 is an acyl-CoA transferase of unknown physiological function, and belongs to a large sequence family of CoA transferases, present in bacteria to humans, which utilize oxoacids as acceptors. In vitro measurements showed that YdiF displays enzymatic activity with short-chain acyl-CoAs. The crystal structures of YdiF and its complex with CoA, the first co-crystal structure for any Family I CoA transferase, have been determined and refined at 1.9 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. YdiF is organized into tetramers, with each monomer having an open α/β structure characteristic of Family I CoA transferases. Co-crystallization of YdiF with a variety of CoA thioesters in the absence of acceptor carboxylic acid resulted in trapping a covalent γ-glutamyl-CoA thioester intermediate. The CoA binds within a well defined pocket at the N- and C-terminal domain interface, but makes contact only with the C-terminal domain. The structure of the YdiF complex provides a basis for understanding the different catalytic steps in the reaction of Family I CoA transferases.

The structure of the YdiF complex provides a basis for understanding the different catalytic steps in the reaction of Family I CoA transferases. Coenzyme A is a cofactor utilized by as many as 4% of all enzymes for a diverse variety of biological functions, including cell-cell-mediated recognition, nerve impulse conductance, transcription, and fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation (1Mishra P.K. Drueckhammer D.G. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 3283-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2Knudsen J. Jensen M.V. Hansen J.K. Faergeman N.J. Neergaard T.B. Gaigg B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 192: 95-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mainly, these reactions involve the binding and transfer of an acyl group from one substrate to another as part of an enzymatic reaction; it has been noted that coenzyme A is the most prominent acyl group carrier in all living systems (3Engel C. Wierenga R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Enzymecatalyzed reactions employing CoA thioesters can be divided into two categories, (i) those where the thioester carbonyl C atom reacts as an electrophile and (ii) those where the thioester α-carbon is deprotonated and reacts as a nucleophile, in Claisen enzymes (1Mishra P.K. Drueckhammer D.G. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 3283-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). CoA transferases, which catalyze the reversible transfer of CoA from a donor CoA thioester to a carboxylic acid acceptor generating the free donor and a new acyl-CoA (Scheme 1), belong to the first category of enzymes. Among the large number of CoA transferases, much attention has focused on mitochondrial succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase (SCOT), 4The abbreviations used are: SCOTsuccinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferaseGCTglutaconate CoA transferaser.m.s.root mean square.4The abbreviations used are: SCOTsuccinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferaseGCTglutaconate CoA transferaser.m.s.root mean square. as its autosomal recessive deficiency in humans results in improper ketone body utilization causing episodic severe ketosis, hypoglycemia, and ultimately coma (4Fukao T.

Dis. 2001; 24: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Three classes of CoA transferases have been defined based mainly on mechanistic and sequence criteria (6Heider J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Family I enzymes employ as acceptors 3-oxoacids, short-chain fatty acids, or glutaconate. These enzymes operate with a ping-pong kinetic mechanism and form a covalent thioester intermediate (7Solomon F. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1079-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most thoroughly studied member of the Family I CoA transferases is SCOT. Family II consists of the multifunctional enzymes citrate or citramalate lyase, and unlike Family I enzymes, they do not form a covalent thioester intermediate. Family III enzymes have been discovered more recently, and are distinct both mechanistically (6Heider J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Jonsson S.

Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) from Family I enzymes. Family III enzymes require formation of an enzyme-substrate ternary complex for catalysis. Both Families I and III of CoA transferases are expected to form either glutamyl-(Family I; Ref. 10Selmer T. Buckel W. J. Biol.

Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1079-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11White H. Solomon F. Jencks W.P. J. Biol.

Fierke C.A. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11678-11689Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These studies established a landmark for the concept of substrate binding energy utilization by an enzyme to effect catalysis, showing that SCOT utilizes its covalent (γ-glutamyl-CoA thioester) and noncovalent interactions with the CoA moiety of the acyl-CoA substrate differentially to reduce the Gibbs activation energy required for catalysis (13Whitty A. Fierke C.A. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11678-11689Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The utilization of this binding energy for catalysis differs for different chemical moieties within the CoA cofactor, as well for the different steps along the reaction coordinate. Although crystal structures are available for three Family I CoA transferases, including glutaconate CoA transferase (GCT) from Acidaminococcus fermentens (14Jacob U. Mack M. Clausen T. Huber R. Buckel W. Messerschmidt A. Structure. 1997; 5: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), acetate-CoA transferase (ACT, α-subunit) from Escherichia coli (15Korolev S.

Sci. 2004; 60: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), no structure has yet been determined with bound substrate or product. The absence of an enzyme-substrate co-crystal structure for any Family I CoA transferase has prevented a detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism at the atomic level.Here, we present the crystal structure of YdiF and its complex with CoA, belonging to Family I of the CoA transferases. Activity measurements in vitro confirmed that YdiF is indeed a CoA transferase and identified it as having broad substrate specificity for short-chain acyl-CoA thioesters with the activity decreasing when the length of the carboxylic acid chain exceeds four carbons. Co-crystallization with different CoA derivatives in the absence of an acceptor co-substrate allowed us to capture the structure of the γ-glutamyl-CoA thioester, a reaction intermediate. This structure allows us to propose roles for structurally conserved residues involved in substrate binding or catalysis. Based on the native and γ-glutamyl-CoA thioester crystal structures, we propose a structural description for the steps in the Family I CoA-transferase catalytic cycle.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning, Expression, and Purification—The ydiF gene was amplified by PCR from E. coli O157:H7 genomic DNA (18Perna N.T. Plunkett G.I. Blattner F.R. Mau B. Blattner F.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and oligonucleotide primers (IDT, Coralville, IA). The ydiF gene was cloned into a modified pET15b vector (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as a fusion with a TEV protease-cleavable N-terminal (His)8 tag. The E. coli methionine auxotroph strain DL41(DE3) was transformed by the plasmid, for the production of selenomethionine-labeled protein (19Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar).Bacterial cultures were grown in Circle Grow medium (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA), or LeMaster medium for selenomethionine-labeled protein (19Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced with 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-βd-galactopyranoside followed by a 6-h incubation at room temperature. Cell pellets were lysed by solubilization in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.4 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.7 mg lysozyme, 10 units/ml Benzonase nuclease (Novagen), 1× Bugbuster detergent solution (Novagen), and 1 tablet of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 40 min, 4 °C) and soluble protein was incubated with 2 ml of DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in lysis buffer without lysozyme, Benzonase, or detergent. The flow-through fraction was then loaded onto 2-ml (bed volume) of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8), 0.4 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 40 mm imidazole, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. YdiF was eluted with the above buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluted protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8), 0.4 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol, was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 8 mg/ml. The (His)8 tag was not removed following purification. Selenomethioninelabeled protein was purified in a similar manner.Gel filtration chromatography was carried out using a Superose 12 HR10/30 column on an Akta Purifier FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Purified YdiF enzyme (200 μg) was applied to the column pre-equilibrated with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.4 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and protein elution was monitored by UV absorption at λ = 280 nm. Molecular masses were estimated by comparison with the elution profile of molecular mass standards (Sigma). Dynamic light-scattering measurements were done on a DynaPro plate reader molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions, Charlottesville, VA) at room temperature using a protein concentration of 8 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8), 0.4 m NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol.Mass Spectrometry—Electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry was performed using an Agilent 1100 Series LC/MSD (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). YdiF protein was diluted to 0.4 mg/ml in 20% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and ionized by direct injection. The γ-glutamyl-CoA thioester form of YdiF was prepared in a 50-μl reaction consisting of 0.15 μm YdiF, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and 1 mm CoA thioester (acetyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, or crotonoyl-CoA) in the presence and absence of 20 mm sodium acetate. For identification of products, 2 μl of the reaction mixture following incubation at 21 °C for 2 h was injected and analysis was carried out in negative mode with the above buffer system with 10 mm ammonium acetate.Enzyme Activity Measurements—Characterization of YdiF enzymatic activity was performed essentially according to Buckel et al. (20Buckel W. Dorn U. Semmler R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A 1-ml reaction mixture containing 50 μm coenzyme A derivative (Sigma), 10 mm sodium acetate (or other carboxylic acid), 10 mm oxaloacetate, 10 μg of citrate synthase (Sigma), 10 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), and 20 μg of purified YdiF was incubated at room temperature for 30, 60, and 120 min and the release of free coenzyme A monitored at 412 nm and detected via formation of the nitrothiobenzoate dianion. Propionate-CoA transferase from Clostridium propionicum (21Selmer T. Willianzheimer A. Hertzel M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control.Crystallization—Initial crystallization conditions were determined by hanging drop vapor diffusion using screens from Hampton Research (Laguna Hills, CA). The best YdiF crystals were obtained by equilibrating 1 μl of protein (7.5 mg/ml) in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (22.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 3% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5) and suspended over 1 ml of reservoir solution. Crystals grew to a size of ∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.06 mm in 2 days at 21 °C. For data collection, crystals were transferred for 1 min to a cryo-protectant solution containing reservoir solution supplemented with 17% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, picked up in a nylon loop, and flash cooled in a N2 cold stream (Oxford Cryosystem, Oxford, UK). Crystals of YdiF belong to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 80.2, b = 132.3, c = 105.1 Å, β = 100.6°, and Z = 8, with a Vm of 2.4 Å3 Da–1 and a solvent content of 48% (22Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7902) Google Scholar).Crystals of the YdiF-γ-glutamyl-CoA thioester were obtained by cocrystallization of YdiF with 10 mm acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, or crotonoyl-CoA (Sigma), and reservoir solutions containing 15.5–17.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 and 80 mm sodium potassium tartrate. Crystals formed after 3–4 days by mixing 1 μl of 7.5 mg/ml YdiF in buffer and 1.5 μl of reservoir solution in a microbatch plate and layering it with paraffin oil. Crystals were cryoprotected by a brief transfer to a solution containing reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol and flash cooled in the nitrogen stream at 100 K. Crystals obtained in the presence of acetoacetyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and propionyl-CoA also belonged to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 81.1, b = 140.2, c = 112.6 Å and β = 108.2°, whereas crystals obtained from butyryl-CoA and crotonoyl-CoA had cell dimensions a = 80.8, b = 137.1, c = 110.4 Å, and β = 105.8°.Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Diffraction data from a selenomethionine-labeled YdiF crystal were collected using a three wavelength MAD regime with a Quantum-4 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., San Diego, CA) at beamline X8C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data processing and scaling was performed with HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar) (TABLE ONE). Of 44 expected selenium atoms in the asymmetric unit, 39 were located using data to 2.7-Å resolution with the program SOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Sci. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), and used to calculate phases with a resulting figure of merit of 0.55. Density modification with the program RESOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Sci. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) improved the quality of the map (figure of merit = 0.73) and allowed for automated model building of 52% of main chain atoms and fitting of 26% of the expected side chains within the asymmetric unit. The partial model obtained from RESOLVE was extended manually with the help of the program O (26Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The final model of apo-YdiF includes four independent monomers, each consisting of residues 4–276, 284–342, and 349–529 with good stereochemistry (PRO-CHECK, Ref. 28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The model also includes 1271 water molecules and has an R-factor of 0.187 and Rfree of 0.221 for all data to 1.9-Å resolution (TABLE ONE).Diffraction data for YdiF co-crystallized with various CoA thioesters were collected at beamline X29, National Synchrotron Light Source, using a Quantum-315 CCD detector (ADSC). Datasets were obtained as follows: acetoacetyl-CoA (2.4 Å), acetyl-CoA (2.0 Å), propionyl-CoA (2.1 Å), butyryl-CoA (2.15 Å), and crotonoyl-CoA (2.4 Å). The structures of YdiF-CoA complexes were determined by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (29Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Sci. 2001; 57: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) with the apo-YdiF tetramer as the search model. Comparison of electron density maps for each of the datasets collected showed very similar features in the active site region, therefore, only data from acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA co-crystals, which showed good density for CoA, were used to build and refine models of the CoA complex. In subunit D of the YdiF-CoA complex obtained from the butyryl-CoA co-crystals the C-terminal domain is less well ordered because of few crystal lattice contacts. These models were refined using REFMAC to a final R-value of 0.184 (Rfree of 0.224) for the CoA thioester complex derived from acetyl-CoA, and an R-value of 0.186 (Rfree of 0.235) for the same complex derived from butyryl-CoA, respectively.

Within the E. coli K12 genome, the individual N-terminal domain (residues 12–255) and C-terminal domain (residues 285–512) of YdiF are related in sequence to AtoD (24% identity) and AtoA (25% identity), representing the α- and β-subunits, respectively, of ACT (36Jenkins L.S. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 42-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The highest similarity to a CoA transferase with an experimentally verified function is for propionyl-CoA transferase from C. propionicum, which shows 45% sequence identity with YdiF (21Selmer T. Willianzheimer A. Hertzel M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), leading to the possibility that YdiF possesses this function. YdiF also shows 23% sequence identity to SCOT from pig heart (37Lin T.W. Bridger W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 975-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal domains of YdiF show 16 and 18% identity, respectively, with the α- and β-subunits of GCT (38Mack M. Bendrat K. Zelder O. Eckel E. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J.

Chem. 1976; 6: 1688-1699Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), various acyl-CoA thioesters were tested for in vitro activity with YdiF. Among the CoA derivatives tested, acetoacetyl-CoA exhibited the highest activity with acetate as an acceptor. When acetyl-CoA was used as the donor, YdiF utilized propionate, acetoacetate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and 4-hydroxybutyrate as acceptors but not isovalerate (TABLE TWO). No free CoA could be detected when the enzyme was incubated with CoA derivatives in the absence or presence of co-substrate. Overall, the activity profile of YdiF with various CoA thioesters resembles that of ACT (39Sramek S.J. Frerman F.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 171: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Based on the activity profile and sequence analysis, we speculate that YdiF plays a role in short-chain fatty acid metabolism in E. coli (41Nunn W.D. Microbiol.

Open table in a new tab Monomer StructureThe asymmetric unit contains four nearly identical YdiF monomers, with any pair of them superimposing with a root mean square deviation between 0.26 and 0.41 Å for all Cα atoms. Each YdiF monomer consists of two domains, an N-terminal domain (Val4-Pro254) and C-terminal domain (Leu285-Ala529), each having an open α β-protein fold. A polypeptide linker (Asp225 -Pro284) connects these two domains. The N-terminal domain is made of three layers, with the core being a central, eight-stranded parallel β-sheet with one anti-parallel edge strand. On one side of this sheet, near its center, are two α-helices flanked on either side by a 4-stranded and 3-stranded mixed β-sheet, respectively, together forming a second layer. The third layer, on the opposite side of the central β-sheet, is made of three α-helices and a short helical turn (Fig. 1a). The C-terminal domain has a very similar three-layered architecture with a central, 10-stranded mixed β-sheet with three α-helices and a β-hairpin on one side forming the domain interface, and two α-helices and a helical turn on the other, solvent-exposed side. The two domains associate to form a bowl-like shape with a deep cleft between them, and the active site located at the bottom of the bowl. Residues forming the domain interface are located in regions 94–150, 203–210, and 265–273 of the N-terminal domain and 334–347, 390–407, and 449–460 of the C-terminal domain.FIGURE 1a, stereo view of the YdiF monomer, with secondary structure elements colored yellow and red (N-terminal domain) or cyan and magenta (C-terminal domain).

The N- and C-terminal domains can be superimposed with a r.m.s. deviation of 1.6 Å for 85 Cα pairs. Structure-based sequence alignment of these two domains shows several long insertions in different locations (result not shown). The very low level of sequence identity retained between the two domains (∼6%) suggests that this gene duplication event occurred in the distant past. A similar ancient gene duplication event has been postulated for the α- and β-subunits of GCT, which together form the active heterodimer (14Jacob U. Mack M. Clausen T. Huber R. Buckel W.

The crystal structure shows that the YdiF tetramer is formed as a dimer of dimers having pseudo 222 symmetry, with the two dimers (AB or CD) associating tightly along the pseudo 2-fold axis (Fig. 1b). The contacts between dimers are less pronounced than those involved in dimer formation, with a buried area of ∼1470 Å2 or ∼4% per dimer. At the dimer-dimer interface, the N-terminal domain of each monomer (A or B, respectively) makes contacts (<4 Å) with only one monomer (C or D, respectively) of the second"

Recently, we determined that MT1-MMP was trafficked to the centrosomes in the course of endocytosis. Our data suggested that the functionally important, integral, centrosomal protein, pericentrin-2, was a cleavage target of MT1-MMP in human and in canine cells and that the sequence of the cleavage sites were ALRRLLG1156↓L1157FG and ALRRLLS2068↓L2069FG, respectively. The presence of Asp-948 at the P1 position inactivated the corresponding site (ALRRLLD948-L949FGD) in murine pericentrin. To confirm that MT1-MMP itself cleaves pericentrin directly, rather than indirectly, we analyzed the cleavage of the peptides that span the MT1-MMP cleavage site. In addition, we analyzed glioma U251 cells, which co-expressed MT1-MMP with the wild type murine pericentrin and the D948G mutant. We determined that the D948G mutant that exhibited the cleavage sequence of human pericentrin was sensitive to MT1-MMP, whereas unmodified murine pericentrin was resistant to proteolysis. Taken together, our results confirm that MT1-MMP cleaves pericentrin-2 in humans but not in mice and that mouse models of cancer probably cannot be used to critically examine MT1-MMP functionality.

To demonstrate that MT1-MMP cleaves pericentrin directly, we used mutagenesis of murine pericentrin. The peptide sequence of murine, canine, and human pericentrin-2 is homologous. There is, however, a single amino acid substitution at the P1 position of the MT1-MMP cleavage site in murine pericentrin when compared with that of human and canine proteins. Consistent with the cleavage preferences of MT1-MMP (34Kridel S.J. Sawai H. Ratnikov B.I. Chen E.I. Li W. Godzik A. Strongin A.Y. Smith J.W. J. Biol.

Here, we reconstructed the MT1-MMP human cleavage site in the murine pericentrin-2 sequence. Consistent with the proteolysis of human pericentrin-2 at the ALRRLLG1156↓L1157FG site, a single D948G mutation transformed murine pericentrin into the cleavage target of MT1-MMP. We suggest that these results confirm that MT1-MMP cleaves pericentrin in humans, but not in mice, and that the intracellular function of centrosomal MT1-MMP in humans cannot be fully recapitulated in the cellular and animal models in mice.

The recombinant catalytic domain of human and murine MT1-MMP was each expressed in Escherichia coli and then purified from the inclusion bodies and refolded to restore the catalytic activity (36Ratnikov B. Deryugina E. Leng J. Marchenko G. Dembrow D. Strongin A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The peptides ALRRLLGLFG, ALRRLLSLFG, and ALRRLLGLFG, which span the MT1-MMP putative cleavage site in murine, canine, and human pericentrin, respectively, were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). The peptides were cleaved for 2 h by the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP at the enzyme-substrate ratio of 1:1000 and the digest samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry (18Golubkov V.S.

Mutagenesis and Cell Transfection—The cDNA construct of murine pericentrin was inserted in the pLPX7-blasticidin vector using routine manipulations. The oligonucleotide direct and reverse primers (5′-CTCCGAGATGCCCTGAGGAGACTTCTAGGCCTGTTTGGGGACACACTGAAGGCAGC-3′ and GCTGCCTTCAGTGTGTCCCCAAACAGGCCTAGAAGTCTCCTCAGGGCACTCGGAG-3′, respectively; mutant positions are underlined) were used in PCR mutagenesis to insert the D948G mutation in the sequence of murine pericentrin. The presence of the mutation in the mutant construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mock-transfected human U251 glioma cells (mock), the cells stably overexpressing MT1-MMP (MT cells) and the cells in which MT1-MMP was stably silenced by the 5′-GAAGCCUGGCUACAGCAAUAU-3′ siRNA construct (siMT cells) were constructed and partially characterized earlier (18Golubkov V.S.

The 5′-GGUCCAUGCUGCAGAAAAACU-3′ scrambled siRNA construct was used as a control. Both siRNA constructs were cloned in the psiLentGene-puromycin vector (Promega, Madison, WI). There was no effect of the scrambled siRNA construct on the expression of MT1-MMP in U251 cells (not shown). Cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In this work, mock, MT, and siMT cells were additionally transiently transfected with the pLPX7 plasmid coding for the wild type and the D948G mutant murine pericentrin-2. Blasticidin-resistant cells were selected in 7 days. The expression of murine pericentrin was analyzed by Western blotting of the cell lysates, which were prepared from the total pool of blasticidin-resistant cells. To identify both the N-terminal and the C-terminal fragments of pericentrin, a mixture of 4b and M8 antibodies was used in these experiments. The expression of the murine pericentrin constructs was also analyzed by immunostaining the transfected cells. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated for 4 h with the primary antibody followed by incubation for 2 h with the species-specific secondary antibody conjugated with green Alexa Fluor 488 or red Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were acquired at a 600× original magnification on a Olympus BX51 fluorescent microscope equipped with a cooled MagnaFire camera (Olympus, San Diego, CA). General Methods—Gelatin zymography of MMP-2 from medium aliquots, cell surface biotinylation, cell lysate preparation, immunocapture of biotin-labeled MT1-MMP, and Western blotting analysis of MT1-MMP and pericentrin were performed as described in our earlier publications (18Golubkov V.S. Boyd S. Savinov A.Y. Chekanov A.V. Osterman A.L. Remacle A. Rozanov D.V. Doxsey S.J. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol.

The buffers used for the preparation of cell lysates were supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (pepstatin, leupeptin, bestatin, aprotinin, and E-64) and in addition, with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EDTA (1 mm each) to prevent additional, artificial proteolysis of the lysate samples. Analysis of the Peptides That Span the MT1-MMP Cleavage Site in Human, Canine, and Murine Pericentrin—Our earlier data suggested that cellular MT1-MMP cleaved human centrosomal pericentrin at the ALRRLLG1156↓L1157FG cleavage site (18Golubkov V.S. Boyd S. Savinov A.Y. Chekanov A.V. Osterman A.L. Remacle A. Rozanov D.V. Doxsey S.J. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25079-25086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of human, murine, and canine pericentrin shows that the ALRRLLG1156↓L1157FG and ALRRLLS2068↓L2069FG sequences are present in humans and canines, respectively, whereas mice exhibit the ALRRLL D948L949FG sequence (Fig. 1). In agreement, in the cleavage tests in vitro, MT1-MMP cleaved the synthetic peptides that spun the human and canine cleavage site sequences. In contrast, the peptide ALRRLLD948L949FG that corresponded to the sequence of murine pericentrin was resistant to proteolysis by human MT1-MMP. Murine MT1-MMP also did not cleave this peptide (not shown). These data are consistent with the cleavage preferences of MT1-MMP, and they suggest that the presence of a negatively charged Asp residue at the P1 position is likely to inactivate the site and to protect the peptide substrate from MT1-MMP proteolysis (34Kridel S.J. Sawai H. Ratnikov B.I. Chen E.I. Li W. Godzik A. Strongin A.Y. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23788-23793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP Cleaves the Murine Pericentrin D948G Mutant That Exhibits the MT1-MMP Cleavage Site—To validate our in vitro cleavage data in a cell setting, we first mutated the sequence of murine pericentrin ALRRLLD948L949FG and then isolated the D948G mutant. This mutant exhibited the human MT1-MMP cleavage site ALRRLLG948↓L949FG. We specifically selected robust U251 cells for these studies because they, as in other aggressive malignant cells, exhibit the required compensatory mechanisms to overcome the overexpression of pericentrin. Other cell types usually do not survive the overexpression of this multifunctional, integral, centrosomal protein, the levels of which control cell cycle progression and genetic stability (29Pihan G.A. Purohit A. Wallace J. Malhotra R. Liotta L. Doxsey S.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2212-2219PubMed Google Scholar). We next transfected mock, MT, and siMT cells with the wild type and D948G mutant murine pericentrin. Finally, we determined whether the pericentrin constructs were cleaved in the transfected cells. Fig. 2 shows that the expression of MT1-MMP was silenced in siMT cells. Low levels of MT1-MMP were observed in mock cells, which synthesized MT1-MMP naturally. The expression of MT1-MMP was up-regulated in MT cells, in which a characteristic 42-45-kDa self-degradation form of MT1-MMP was observed in addition to the 60-64-kDa full-length forms of the protease. According to our earlier data and the observations of the others, the presence of the 42-45 self-proteolytic form in the cell samples indicates the presence of high levels of the catalytically potent MT1-MMP (11Hernandez-Barrantes S. Bernardo M. Toth M. Fridman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Osenkowski P. Toth M. Fridman R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 200: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Both the wild type and the D948G mutant murine pericentrins were stable in mock and siMT cells. The cleavage of the wild type murine pericentrin was not observed in MT cells, which overexpress the protease. In contrast, there was an extensive proteolysis of the D948G mutant in MT cells. The combined size of the observed N-terminal and C-terminal cleavage fragments of pericentrin (105 and 140 kDa, respectively) correlated well with the size of intact murine pericentrin (240-250 kDa). Because these experiments were performed with the individual total cell pools obtained via transiently transfecting cells with the pericentrin constructs, the levels of pericentrin differ insignificantly among the samples. As shown by gelatin zymography of the medium samples, mock and siMT cells did not activate secretory MMP-2, which was produced naturally by glioma cells. Consistent with many other reports (12Osenkowski P. Toth M. Fridman R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 200: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), transfection of the cells with MT1-MMP stimulated extensive activation of the MMP-2 zymogen and its conversion into the mature enzyme. The efficiency of MMP-2 activation in MT cells co-transfected with either unmodified murine pericentrin or the D948G mutant was similar when compared with the cells expressing MT1-MMP alone (Fig. 2). These results indicated that the intracellular, pericentrin-cleaving function of MT1-MMP and the status of pericentrin do not affect the proteolytic pericellular function of MT1-MMP. Overall, these results confirmed our in vitro peptide cleavage data and suggested that the reconstruction of the MT1-MMP human cleavage site ALRRLLG948↓L949FG transformed murine pericentrin into the cleavage target of MT1-MMP. In agreement with the proteolysis of mutant pericentrin by MT1-MMP, there was an evident centrosomal co-localization of these two proteins in the transfected cells (Fig. 3). From the 24 known human MMPs, an elevated expression of MT1-MMP is most closely associated with malignancies (5Zucker S. Vacirca J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2004; 23: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 40Bauvois B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). There is extensive evidence that cell surface-associated MT1-MMP functions as one of the key players of pericellular proteolysis in humans and mice (3Seiki M. Cancer Lett. 2003; 194: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 7Sato H. Takino T. Miyamori H. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Holmbeck K.

There is evidence, however, that after being delivered to the plasma membrane, MT1-MMP, along with many other membrane-tethered proteins (46Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 47Nabi I.R. Le P.U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), is internalized. The clathrin- and caveolin-dependent internalization pathways are both involved in the internalization and the recycling of MT1-MMP (14Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 15Remacle A. Murphy G. Roghi C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3905-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In the pathway of MT1-MMP through the cell compartment, the proteolytically potent MT1-MMP accumulates in the microtubulin cytoskeleton-organizing centers, the centrosomes. Our earlier work (18Golubkov V.S. Boyd S. Savinov A.Y. Chekanov A.V. Osterman A.L. Remacle A. Rozanov D.V. Doxsey S.J. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25079-25086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggested that both human and canine pericentrins were cleavage targets of centrosomal MT1-MMP. Pericentrin is an integral centrosomal protein, and it is essential to the normal functioning of centrosomes and to mitotic spindle formation (48Zimmerman W.C. Sillibourne J. Rosa J. Doxsey S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3642-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The expression of MT1-MMP in the centrosomes of either human or canine cells correlated with the presence of the proteolytic fragments of pericentrin. In addition, these events correlated with the induction of mitotic spindle aberrations and aneuploidy in non-malignant MDCK cells (18Golubkov V.S. Boyd S. Savinov A.Y. Chekanov A.V. Osterman A.L.

Strongin A.Y. Poupon M.F. Montesano R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment of the putative cleavage site in human and canine pericentrin (ALRRLLG1156↓L1157FG and ALRRLLS2068↓L2069FG, respectively) supported our biochemical and cellular experiments, because both Gly and Ser are compatible with the known cleavage preferences of MT1-MMP. This alignment also suggested that the corresponding sequence region of murine pericentrin (ALRRLLD948↓L949FGD) is protected from MT1-MMP proteolysis because of the Asp-948 at the P1 position (underlined in the peptide) in the murine sequence. Consistent with this hypothesis, murine pericentrin was resistant to MT1-MMP. Based on this knowledge, we reconstructed the human cleavage site in the murine pericentrin sequence. As expected, the D948G mutant that exhibited the human cleavage site was cleaved by MT1-MMP. We believe that our experiments proved that MT1-MMP cleaves pericentrin directly, and we suggest that centrosomal MT1-MMP, through the cleavage of pericentrin, plays a unique role in human cells. In addition, the presence of the proteolytic fragments of pericentrin in the tumor biopsies, which express high levels of MT1-MMP, supports an important role of the MT1-MMP/pericentrin axis in cancer (18Golubkov V.S. Boyd S. Savinov A.Y. Chekanov A.V. Osterman A.L. Remacle A. Rozanov D.V. Doxsey S.J. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25079-25086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our data imply the pericellular function of MT1-MMP appears to be common across the species, whereas the intracellular, pericentrin-cleaving function of MT1-MMP is absent in mice. These hypotheses add another level of complexity to be overcome in our attempts to understand completely the tumorigenic functions of MT1-MMP in humans, and they warrant additional studies of the genetically redesigned animal models, so that they will fully recapitulate human tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2167007998,"Phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PLD) is a major cellular source of phosphatidic acid and choline, which regulate various physiopathological processes. PLD activation mediated by chemoattractants involves protein phosphorylation. This study provides pharmacological and biochemical evidence of a major role of p44/42 MAP kinases (ERK1/2) in PLD activation induced by the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). ERK1/2 inhibition by the MEK1/2 antagonist U0126 in neutrophilic HL-60 cells or HEK 293T cells stably expressing fMLP receptors abolished fMLP-mediated PLD activity. Conversely, a constitutively activated MEK1 mutant expressed in HEK 293T cells potentiated fMLP-induced PLD activity. Expression of inactive PLD mutants showed that PLD2, but not PLD1, contributed to fMLP-mediated PLD activity. PLD2 co-immunoprecipitated with ERK1/2 and became phosphorylated on MAP kinase consensus sites in fMLP-stimulated cells. In cell-free systems, ERK2 gave rise to strong ATP-dependent PLD activity and directly phosphorylated PLD2 that generated two phosphopeptides only after tryptic digestion. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of ERK activation and the inhibition of PLD expression by antisense oligonucleotides in HL-60 cells suggest that the ERK/PLD2 pathway contributes to fMLP-mediated oxidant production. In conclusion, the fMLP-mediated PLD activity is regulated by ERK1/2, involving a predominant contribution of PLD2. The ERK/PLD2 coupling may provide potential pharmacological targets to control PLD-associated cellular dysfunctions."
https://openalex.org/W1987687737,"The dynamic modulation of chromatin structure is determined by many factors, including enzymes that modify the core histone proteins, enzymes that remodel the structure of chromatin, and factors that bind to genomic DNA to affect its structure. Previous work indicates that the nucleosome binding family of high mobility group proteins (HMGN) facilitates the formation of a chromatin structure that is more conducive for transcription. SWI/SNF complexes are ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes that alter nucleosome structure to facilitate the binding of various regulatory proteins to chromatin. Here we examine the structural consequences of reconstituting chromatin with HMGN1 and the resulting effects on hSWI/SNF function. We demonstrate that HMGN1 decreases the sedimentation velocity of nucleosomal arrays in low ionic strength buffers but has little effect on the structure of more highly folded arrays. We further demonstrate that HMGN1 does not affect SWI/SNF-dependent chromatin remodeling on either mononucleosomes or nucleosomal arrays, indicating that SWI/SNF functions independently of HMGN1."

The tight control of C3a receptor (C3aR) expression is crucial for the regulation of anaphylatoxin-mediated effects. Key factors regulating constitutive expression of the C3aR in the mast cell line HMC-1 and receptor induction by dibutyryl-cAMP in monomyeloblastic U937 cells were determined by functional characterization of the C3aR promoter. Nucleotides -18 to -285 upstream of the translational start site proved to be critical for promoter activity in HMC-1 cells. Binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1 and Ets could be located. Overexpressed c-Jun/c-Fos (AP-1) and Ets-1 led synergistically to increased promoter activity that was substantially reduced by site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding elements within the C3aR promoter. In HMC-1 cells, Ets interacted directly with the predicted binding motif of the C3aR promoter as determined by electromobility shift assays. AP-1 binding to the C3aR promoter was augmented during C3aR induction in U937 cells. A retroviral gene transfer system was used to express a dominant negative mutant of Ets-1 in these cells. The resulting cells failed to up-regulate the C3aR after stimulation with dibutyryl-cAMP and showed decreased AP-1 binding, suggesting that Ets acts here indirectly. Thus, it was established that Ets and the AP-1 element mediates dibutyryl-cAMP induction of C3aR promoter activity, hence providing a mechanistic explanation of dibutyryl-cAMP-dependent up-regulation of C3aR expression. In conclusion, this study demonstrates an important role of AP-1 and a member of the Ets family in the transcriptional regulation of C3aR expression, a prerequisite for the ability of C3a to participate in immunomodulation and inflammation.

The best experimental evidence for the involvement of C3a in diseases has been obtained in animal models using C3aR knock-out mice, guinea pigs with a natural C3aR defect, or specific C3aR inhibitors (8Ames R.S.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 5406-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, C3a and its receptor act partially protective, partially destructive. In endotoxin shock, C3a seems to be protective; the mortality rate of C3aR-/- mice was much higher than that of their wild type littermates, investigated by a cecal ligation puncture sepsis model (12Kildsgaard J. Hollmann T.J. Matthews K.W. Bian K. Murad F. Wetsel R.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5406-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Moreover, C3a participates in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy or toxic injury (13Markiewski M.M. Mastellos D. Tudoran R. DeAngelis R.A. Strey C.W. Franchini S. Wetsel R.A. Erdei A.

Med. 2003; 198: 913-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in an adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model, C3a aggravates the inflammatory reaction (8Ames R.S. Lee D. Foley J.J. Jurewicz A.J. Tornetta M.A. Bautsch W. Settmacher B. Klos A. Erhard K.F. Cousins R.D. Sulpizio A.C. Hieble J.P. McCafferty G. Ward K.W. Adams J.L. Bondinell W.E. Underwood D.C. Osborn R.R. Badger A.M. Sarau H.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6341-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In asthma, C3a is deleterious because C3aR-/--mice are protected from ovalbumin-driven airway hyper-responsiveness and early phase bronchoconstriction (15Hawlisch H. Wills-Karp M. Karp C.L. Kohl J. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In man C3a might play a similar role because its concentration is augmented in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatics after allergen provocation (16Krug N. Tschernig T. Erpenbeck V.J. Hohlfeld J.M. Kohl J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 1841-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Mast cells and eosinophils contribute to certain inflammatory responses. The proinflammatory mediator C3a is a chemotaxin for these cells, suggesting their anaphylatoxin-mediated recruitment into inflamed tissue (17Daffern P.J. Pfeifer P.H. Ember J.A. Hugli T.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 18Hartmann K. Henz B.M. Kruger-Krasagakes S. Kohl J. Burger R. Guhl S. Haase I. Lippert U. Zuberbier T.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 1693-1698PubMed Google Scholar). As recently demonstrated, mast cells are additionally involved in autoimmune diseases (20Benoist C. Mathis D. Nature. 2002; 420: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 21Secor V.H. Secor W.E. Gutekunst C.A. Brown M.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Here, anaphylatoxins are also of importance. C3a exhibits various biological functions in leukocytes, mast cells, and related cell lines expressing the C3aR. Mediated by a pertussis-toxin sensitive G-protein, it leads to the increase of free cytosolic Ca2+, cell activation, and degranulation (17Daffern P.J. Pfeifer P.H. Ember J.A. Hugli T.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 18Hartmann K. Henz B.M. Kruger-Krasagakes S. Kohl J. Burger R. Guhl S. Haase I. Lippert U. Zuberbier T.

Immunopharmacology. 2000; 46: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and cytokine release are also modulated by C3a (23Monsinjon T. Gasque P. Ischenko A. Fontaine M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Fischer W.H. Hugli T.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4279-4286PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sayah S. Ischenko A.M. Zhakhov A.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 3455-3460PubMed Google Scholar). Obviously, the tightly controlled expression of the C3aR is crucial for the regulation of anaphylatoxin-mediated effects. As an example for such a regulation in situ, C3aR expression cannot be detected in normal brain sections although a strong C3aR immunohistochemical staining is evident in areas of inflammation. In meningitis, the C3aR is abundantly expressed by reactive astrocytes, microglia, and infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils. In multiple sclerosis, a strong staining can be additionally detected on smooth muscle cells surrounding blood vessels (27Gasque P. Singhrao S.K. Neal J.W. Wang P. Sayah S. Fontaine M. Morgan B.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3543-3554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, in experimental allergic encephalitis the C3aR was elevated on microglia, infiltrating monocytes/macrophages, and astrocytes (28Davoust N. Jones J. Stahel P.F. Ames R.S. Barnum S.R. Glia. 1999; 26: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). C3aR regulation can also be observed in other tissues: In ovalbumin- or lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice, C3aR expression increased on bronchial smooth muscle cells (29Drouin S.M. Kildsgaard J. Haviland J. Zabner J. Jia H.P. McCray Jr., P.B. Tack B.F. Wetsel R.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In patients suffering from atopic dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis, C3aR expression can be detected in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell clones, cell types that normally do not express this receptor (6Martin U. Bock D. Arseniev L. Tornetta M.A. Ames R.S. Bautsch W. Kohl J. Ganser A. Klos A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Werfel T. Kirchhoff K. Wittmann M. Begemann G. Kapp A. Heidenreich F. Gotze O. Zwirner J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6599-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Corresponding to the regulation in situ, the C3aR can be induced in cell culture by Bt2cAMP or interferon-γ on monomyeloblastic cell lines such as U937 (31Burg M. Martin U. Bock D. Rheinheimer C. Kohl J. Bautsch W. Klos A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5574-5581PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the current study was to obtain a deeper understanding of the regulation of the human C3aR, in particular, its transcriptional control, which has never been investigated before. Constitutive expression of the C3aR in the mast cell line HMC-1 (32Zwirner J. Gotze O. Sieber A. Kapp A. Begemann G. Zuberbier T. Werfel T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 47: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and receptor induction by Bt2cAMP (and TPA) in monomyeloblastic U937 cells (33Klos A. Bank S. Gietz C. Bautsch W. Kohl J. Burg M. Kretzschmar T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11274-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were investigated. The transcription initiation site was identified. The essential part of the C3aR promoter was narrowed down by 5′ and 3′ deletion analysis. Detailed characterization by various methods revealed a crucial role for the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1) and E26-transformation specific (Ets) and their corresponding binding sites within the C3aR promoter. Ets seems to act directly on the C3aR promoter but also indirectly when receptor expression is induced. All reagents were obtained from Sigma if not otherwise indicated. Cell Lines and Cell Culture Conditions—The human mast cell line HMC-1 (kindly provided by J. H. Butterfield) and human monomyeloblastic U937 cells (ATCC CRL 1593) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (ATCC CRL 1573) (4Crass T. Raffetseder U. Martin U. Grove M. Klos A. Kohl J. Bautsch W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (Biochrom AG). Both media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sigma). Transient Transfection of HMC-1 Cells and Reporter Gene Assay— Human C3aR promoter fragments were generated by PCR using the pDP1 plasmid as template (34Paral D. Sohns B. Crass T. Grove M. Kohl J. Klos A. Bautsch W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2417-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and subcloned in between the NheI and HindIII site of pSEAP2-E (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). Primer sequences can be obtained from the corresponding author. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA): TATAA to GCTAA for the TATA box, CAGGAAG to CAAGAAG for the Ets binding site, ATGACTC to ACAACTC for AP-1. Putative transcription factor binding sites were identified with MatInspector® Version 6.2. All constructs were sequenced for verification. HMC-1 cells were transiently transfected in 6-well plates at 1 × 10E6 cells/well with the C3aR promoter constructs either alone or in combination with Ets-1 from chicken, human c-Jun, c-Fos, and Ha-Ras (generous gifts from Dr. A. Nordheim and Dr. B. Luescher), 200 ng each. Effectene transfection reagent® (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction. The transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with pCMV-β-galactosidase (Clontech). Cells were harvested and centrifuged 72 h post-transfection. Secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was determined in the supernatant; β-galactosidase was determined in the cell-lysate. Great EscAPE SEAP™ detection Kit from Clontech and High Sensitivity β-GAL Assay Kit™ were used as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Transient Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine™ according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Generation of a Dominant Negative Mutant of Ets-1 and Its Transduction into U937 Cells—A retroviral gene transfer system was applied to generate U937 cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of Ets-1. It consists of amino acids 306-441 of chicken Ets-1 (accession number M22462) and is, thus, lacking the transactivation domain (35Mattot V. Vercamer C. Soncin F. Calmels T. Huguet C. Fafeur V. Vandenbunder B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 762-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures using TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Five μg of total RNA was transcribed by SuperScript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase from Invitrogen using an oligo(dT) primer (Stratagene). Detection of the Transcription Initiation Site by RT-PCR—cDNA (2 of 60 μl) was generated using a reverse antisense primer (CTGCATCTTCAGGCCAGC) hybridizing to the coding region of the C3aR for cDNA synthesis. The resulting cDNA was applied as template in PCR reactions, combining this reverse antisense primer with a whole set of sense primers that anneal to the C3aR 5′-UTR. The amplified genomic DNA fragments could be excluded because they would additionally contain the 6-kilobase intron. The construct pSEAP2-E308-hC3aR-234, artificially combining part of the promoter region (308 bp) with part of the coding region of the C3aR, was used as a positive control. The primer positions upstream from the start codon were: 104-85 for P1, 141-121 for P2, 159-141 for P3, 190-172 for P4, 215-196 for P5, 230-211 for P6, 240-221 for P7, 253-233 for P8, 269-249 for P9, and 286-267 for P10. Nuclease Protection Assay—3, 10, and 30 μg of RNA were used in the nuclease protection assay (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Thirty μg of yeast RNA served as the negative control. A probe representing part of exon 1 of the C3aR (position -444 to -26) was generated by PCR using a [α-35S]dATP-labeled oligonucleotide (GTCCTGTCTGGTCCCCACACTTAG; -85 to -26) as the reverse antisense primer and a biotinylated sense primer (-444 to -425). Genomic sequence (ligated into the plasmid DP1) served as the template. The sense primer was removed using streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads (Dynal/Invitrogen). The RNA was hybridized overnight at 43 °C followed by nuclease treatment according to the manufacturer's instruction. After digestion, the protected fragments were separated in a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by 3 weeks of exposure of the x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat Ar35 × 43). C3aR Real-time RT-PCR—TaqMan real-time RT-PCR was performed using a C3aR-specific TaqMan® gene expression assay (HS00377780-m1) in combination with the TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix and the 7000 Sequence Detection System for analysis (all Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). For normalization, the housekeeping gene RPS9 was used. Standard curves were generated using serially diluted cDNA. For each sample, the -fold induction was calculated as the ratio of the normalized volume equivalent of the transfected cells to the normalized volume equivalent of the corresponding mock-transfected cells. Competitive 125I-Labeled C3a and C5a Binding Studies—Competitive binding studies with human 125I-labeled C3a or C5a (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as tracer and increasing concentrations of cold C3a or C5a were performed as previously described (6Martin U. Bock D. Arseniev L. Tornetta M.A. Ames R.S. Bautsch W. Kohl J. Ganser A. Klos A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Fura2 Assay for the Determination of Free Cytosolic Ca2+ in Bt2cAMP-induced U937 Cells—This assay was performed exactly as previously described (6Martin U. Bock D. Arseniev L. Tornetta M.A. Ames R.S.

Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—All oligonucleotides were annealed in equimolar amounts and end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP followed by desalting through G-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Biosciences). The following oligonucleotides were used for gel shift experiments: AP-1wt/AP-1mut, Gelshift AP-1 family kit (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium); AP-1-C3aRwt (position -233 to -213 of the C3aR promoter), 5′-ttcaaagtgagtcatttctaa-3′; AP-1-C3aRmut (position -233 to -213 of the C3aR promoter, with mutated AP-1 site), 5′-ttcaaagtgagttgtttctaa-3′; Ets-1wt (36Kang R.

Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (NucBuster Protein Extraction Kit, Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). Binding reactions were performed in 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2% Ficoll, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For competition, 5-7.5 μg of nuclear extract were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with an excess of nonlabeled oligonucleotide: 5-, 50-, or 500-fold molar concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. After the addition of 100,000 cpm of the 32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide, the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The DNA-nuclear factor complexes were resolved on a 1 × Tris-buffered EDTA, 7% polyacrylamide gel pre-electrophoresed at room temperature for 60 min at 100 V. The gel was dried and then analyzed on a phosphorimaging plate. C3aR Transcription Initiation Site Determined by Nuclease Protection Assay and RT-PCR—To localize the transcription initiation site (TIS in Fig. 1 and 2a) of the C3aR promoter, total RNA from HMC-1 cells was analyzed by nuclease protection assay. A single band at position -185 relative to the start codon became visible in the radiography (Fig. 1, upper panel), indicating the (major) transcription initiation site.FIGURE 2Deletion analysis of the C3aR promoter (b-d) and mutations of putative TATA-boxes (e), analyzed by SEAP reporter gene assays in HMC-1 cells, indicate positive regulatory promoter elements and a TATA-less promoter. The genomic organization of the human C3aR (hC3aR), the predicted cis-acting elements (MatInspector® Software) for AP-1 and Ets, and two putative TATA-boxes are depicted in the upper part of this figure (a). A ∼2-kilobase region of the promoter located in exon one was stepwise deleted from the 5′-end (b and c), and the 3′-end (d). Two putative TATA boxes, TATA1 centered at -275 and TATA2 centered at -351, were deleted either as separate mutations (mutTATA1 and mutTATA2) or combined (mutTATA1/2) (e). Nucleotide positions are given relative to the start codon (+1). The horizontal lines at the left represent graphically the part of the C3aR promoter that has been ligated into the pSEAP2-E reporter gene vector. The names of the constructs indicate the length of the analyzed part of the C3aR promoter. For normalization, a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase under the control of the CMV promoter was cotransfected. On the right side of b-e, the normalized SEAP activity determined in the supernatant 3 days after transient transfection is depicted as the mean ± S.D. of n = 3(b-d) and n = 4(e) independent experiments (and duplicates within each experiment), respectively. For better comparison, the C3aR promoter activity of construct pSEAP2-E267 was defined as 100%. ORF, open reading frame; TIS, transcription initiation site; kb, kilobases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The RNA was additionally analyzed by RT-PCR, combining a whole set of sense primers annealing to the C3aR 5′-UTR with one common reverse antisense primer hybridizing to the coding region of the C3aR (Fig. 1, lower panel). Strong amplified fragments (P1-P4 in Fig. 1) became apparent using primer combinations with sense primers binding within 185 bp of the 5′-UTR relative to the start codon. Primer combinations with sense primers annealing further upstream resulted in weaker but still visible PCR products (P5-P10 in Fig. 1), suggesting an additional minor transcription start site located upstream of position -280. A vector containing the C3aR 5′-UTR (cloned from genomic DNA) in combination with part of the coding region of the C3aR served as positive control. As expected, amplified fragments resulted with all primer pairs (not shown). Identification of Regulatory Regions by 5′ and 3′ Deletion of the C3aR 5′-UTR in HMC-1 Cells—To gain further insights into the modes of regulation of the C3aR, the minimal transcriptional unit of the C3aR promoter was mapped, and key regulatory elements within this promoter directing basal gene expression were identified. HMC-1 cells constitutively expressing the C3aR (and thus, exhibiting all necessary cofactors) were used in this deletion analysis. The gene of the human C3aR is located on chromosome 12p13. A single 6-kilobase intron is present 17 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon of exon 2 (34Paral D. Sohns B. Crass T. Grove M. Kohl J. Klos A. Bautsch W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2417-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A 2-kilobase region of the C3aR 5′-UTR located directly upstream of the intron was analyzed by SEAP reporter gene assay (Fig. 2a). For this purpose, a whole set of overlapping fragments of the C3aR 5′-UTR was generated by PCR and cloned into the pSEAP2-Enhancer vector, as indicated in the corresponding figures (Fig. 2, b-e). In all figures and throughout the paper, all nucleotide positions are given relative to the ATG start codon. The names of the constructs indicate the lengths of the analy"
https://openalex.org/W2008486358,"Cervical carcinomas express human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which are required to maintain the proliferative state of cancer cells. Repression of E6 and E7 expression results in acquisition of senescent phenotype and in the rescue of functional p53 and p105(Rb) pathways; therefore, therapies directed against either viral protein may be beneficial. However, the systems to study HPV in vitro are technically difficult and not convenient for screening of antiviral compounds. This has hampered the discovery of drugs against HPV. Here we describe the generation and use of a high-throughput screening system based on keratinocytes stably transfected with a reporter construct containing the regulatory sequence of E6 and E7 gene transcription (LCR) that allows easy detection of inhibitors of E6 and E7 expression in libraries of synthetic or biological compounds. The assay was used to screen a wide panel of cytokines: among them, IL-4, IL-13, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha, and IFN-beta were found to induce a strong inhibition of the LCR activity. Our assay provides a validated tool in the search for drugs against HPV-associated cervical carcinomas and allowed the first systematic analysis of the effect of cytokines on the HPV-16 LCR transcriptional activity."
