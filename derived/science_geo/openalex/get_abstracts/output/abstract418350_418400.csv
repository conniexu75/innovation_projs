https://openalex.org/W2042997794,"Tuning Hydrogen Adsorption Heterogeneous metal catalysts for hydrogenating unsaturated organic compounds need to bind molecular hydrogen strongly enough that it dissociates and forms adsorbed hydrogen atoms, but must not bind these atoms too strongly, or the transfer to the organic molecule will be impeded. Kyriakou et al. (p. 1209 ) examined surface alloy catalysts created when palladium (Pd) atoms are adsorbed on a copper (Cu) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy and desorption techniques under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The Pd atoms could bind hydrogen dissociatively—which, under these conditions, the Cu surfaces could not—allowing the Cu surface to take up adsorbed hydrogen atoms. These weakly bound hydrogen atoms were able to selectively hydrogenate styrene and acetylene."

Variations in local thickness and stiffness will alter the buckling patterns, but controlling this in a simple and predictable way is difficult. Kim et al. (p. 1201 ; see the Perspective by Sharon ) used halftone lithography with two photomasks to create highly cross-linked dots embedded in a lightly cross-linked matrix of a swellable polymer. This material could generate “smooth” swelling profiles on thin sheets with arbitrary two-dimensional geometries so that complex three-dimensional structures could be produced."
https://openalex.org/W2054254706,"A Useful Cover-Up Many industrial catalysts that consist of metal nanoparticles adsorbed on metal oxide supports undergo deactivation after prolonged use. Organic reactants can decompose and cover the metal with carbon (“coking”), and other processes can push the size distribution to fewer but larger particles that have less overall surface area available for reaction (“sintering”). Lu et al. (p. 1205 ) used atomic-layer deposition to apply a uniform overlayer of alumina onto supported palladium nanoparticles. This coating greatly increased the resistance of the nanoparticles to coking and sintering during the oxidative dehydration of ethane to ethylene."

In an effort to better define these oligomers, Laganowsky et al. (p. 1228 ) identified a segment of the fibril-forming protein αB crystalline (ABC) that forms both amyloid fibrils and a relatively stable oligomer. ABC oligomers were toxic in a cell viability assay and were recognized by an amyloid-oligomer–specific antibody. A crystal structure of the oligomers showed that six peptides formed an antiparallel barrel termed a cylindrin. Amyloid oligomers are likely to be structurally polymorphic, but cylindrin-like assemblies offer a model for these elusive structures."

In plants, these circadian rhythms affect processes as diverse as carbon metabolism and leaf orientation. Huang et al. (p. 75 , published online 8 March) have now analyzed the interactions driven by a key element of the circadian clock in plants, TOC1 (“TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1”). TOC1 helps to coordinate responses of the morning and evening cycles, functioning to repress activity of other clock components."
https://openalex.org/W2010871116,"Mechanics of a Meltdown For all the potential hazards presented by nuclear power plants, there have been very few incidents that have caused human or environmental harm. However, those that have happened have often had disastrous consequences, for example, the accidents at Chernobyl in Ukraine and, just last year, at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan. Burns et al. (p. 1184 ; see the cover) review the state of knowledge on the chemical and physical processes following the nuclear reactor accident and how these results may inform decision-making during future events. Because a large portion of prior research has focused on radionuclide transport following leaks from nuclear waste repositories, and not active reactors, experiments at the more extreme conditions experienced in major nuclear core-melt accidents may have more predictive value."
https://openalex.org/W2073671007,"Algae have recently gained attention as a potential source for biodiesel; however, much is still unknown about the biological triggers that cause the production of triacylglycerols. We used RNA-Seq as a tool for discovering genes responsible for triacylglycerol (TAG) production in Chlamydomonas and for the regulatory components that activate the pathway. Three genes encoding acyltransferases, DGAT1, DGTT1, and PDAT1, are induced by nitrogen starvation and are likely to have a role in TAG accumulation based on their patterns of expression. DGAT1 and DGTT1 also show increased mRNA abundance in other TAG-accumulating conditions (minus sulfur, minus phosphorus, minus zinc, and minus iron). Insertional mutants, pdat1-1 and pdat1-2, accumulate 25% less TAG compared with the parent strain, CC-4425, which demonstrates the relevance of the trans-acylation pathway in Chlamydomonas. The biochemical functions of DGTT1 and PDAT1 were validated by rescue of oleic acid sensitivity and restoration of TAG accumulation in a yeast strain lacking all acyltransferase activity. Time course analyses suggest than a SQUAMOSA promoter-binding protein domain transcription factor, whose mRNA increases precede that of lipid biosynthesis genes like DGAT1, is a candidate regulator of the nitrogen deficiency responses. An insertional mutant, nrr1-1, accumulates only 50% of the TAG compared with the parental strain in nitrogen-starvation conditions and is unaffected by other nutrient stresses, suggesting the specificity of this regulator for nitrogen-deprivation conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1999799374,"Multi-dimensional quantum walks can exhibit highly non-trivial topological structure, providing a powerful tool for simulating quantum information and transport systems. We present a flexible implementation of a 2D optical quantum walk on a lattice, demonstrating a scalable quantum walk on a non-trivial graph structure. We realized a coherent quantum walk over 12 steps and 169 positions using an optical fiber network. With our broad spectrum of quantum coins we were able to simulate the creation of entanglement in bipartite systems with conditioned interactions. Introducing dynamic control allowed for the investigation of effects such as strong non-linearities or two-particle scattering. Our results illustrate the potential of quantum walks as a route for simulating and understanding complex quantum systems."
https://openalex.org/W2105685115,"Decremental loss of PTEN results in cancer susceptibility and tumor progression. PTEN elevation might therefore be an attractive option for cancer prevention and therapy. We have generated several transgenic mouse lines with PTEN expression elevated to varying levels by taking advantage of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-mediated transgenesis. The ""Super-PTEN"" mutants are viable and show reduced body size due to decreased cell number, with no effect on cell size. Unexpectedly, PTEN elevation at the organism level results in healthy metabolism characterized by increased energy expenditure and reduced body fat accumulation. Cells derived from these mice show reduced glucose and glutamine uptake and increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and are resistant to oncogenic transformation. Mechanistically we find that PTEN elevation orchestrates this metabolic switch by regulating PI3K-dependent and -independent pathways and negatively impacting two of the most pronounced metabolic features of tumor cells: glutaminolysis and the Warburg effect."
https://openalex.org/W1984460672,"MicroDNA, Microdeletion? Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is widespread in eukaryotes. Shibata et al. (p. 82 , published online 8 March) have found a new form of eccDNA—microDNA—in embryonic mouse brain, heart, and liver in adult mouse brain and in mouse and human cell lines. Unlike eccDNA, which is derived from repetitive sequences, transposable elements, or viral genomes, circular microDNA is derived from nonrepetitive genomic sequences and, very often, regions associated with genes. Length profiles—at 200 to 400 base pairs long—suggest that microDNA preferentially arises from regions of DNA occupied by nucleosomes. Furthermore, microDNA has very short regions of micro-homology at the beginning and ends of the circles. Analysis of several very common microDNAs indicates that their formation seems to result in microdeletions in somatic and germline genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2029669415,"Tic-Toc Segmentation Clock Molecular oscillators are an essential component of vertebrate segmentation, but whether they exist in segmented animals in general has been controversial for almost a decade. Sarrazin et al. (p. 338 , published online 8 March; see the Perspective by Roth and Panfilio ) demonstrate the existence of a segmentation clock in the growth zone of insects. Microsurgical manipulation and embryo culture revealed cyclic expression of the segmentation gene Tc-odd in the beetle Tribolium castaneum , which suggests that segmentation clocks are a widely shared mechanism that mediates animal segmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2066067692,"Flashy Feathers Feather colors play key roles in the lives of birds, functioning in everything from camouflage, to thermoregulation, to sexual signaling. Much recent research has revealed that some dinosaurs also had feathers, and examination of feather components in fossil and preserved feathers has begun to reveal how feather color may have played a role in the lives of these dinosaurs. Li et al. (p. 1215 ) compared the characteristics of the melanosomes of the paravian dinosaur Microraptor to those found in extant birds, which suggest that its feathers were black and iridescent. The existence of this subtle color reflectance, together with morphological aspects of the feathered tail, suggests an important role for signaling in the early evolution of feathers."
https://openalex.org/W2074189907,"MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that function as key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we demonstrate that miR-214 is frequently down-regulated in cervical cancer, and its expression reduces the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of cervical cancer cells, whereas inhibiting its expression results in enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion. miR-214 binds to the 3'-UTR of UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 7 (GALNT7), thereby repressing GALNT7 expression. Furthermore, we are the first to show, using quantitative real-time PCR, that GALNT7 is frequently up-regulated in cervical cancer. The knockdown of GALNT7 markedly inhibits cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas ectopic expression of GALNT7 significantly enhances these properties, indicating that GALNT7 might function as an oncogene in cervical cancer. The restoration of GALNT7 expression can counteract the effect of miR-214 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of cervical cancer cells. Together, these results indicate that miR-214 is a new regulator of GALNT7, and both miR-214 and GALNT7 play important roles in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1994703283,"The differentiation of osteoblasts from their precursors, mesenchymal stem cells, is an important component of bone homeostasis as well as fracture healing. The A2B adenosine receptor (A2BAR) is a Gαs/αq-protein-coupled receptor that signals via cAMP. cAMP-mediated signaling has been demonstrated to regulate the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into various skeletal tissue lineages. Here, we studied the role of this receptor in the differentiation of MSCs to osteoblasts. In vitro differentiation of bone marrow-derived MSCs from A2BAR KO mice resulted in lower expression of osteoblast differentiation transcription factors and the development of fewer mineralized nodules, as compared with WT mice. The mechanism of effect involves, at least partially, cAMP as indicated by experiments involving activation of the A2BAR or addition of a cAMP analog during differentiation. Intriguingly, in vivo, microcomputed tomography analysis of adult femurs showed lower bone density in A2BAR KO mice as compared with WT. Furthermore, A2BAR KO mice display a delay in normal fracture physiology with lower expression of osteoblast differentiation genes.

Bone health is a chief medical concern for the aging population, and the deterioration of bone is significantly correlated with fracture, disease, and a diminished quality of life (1Ray N.F. Chan J.K. Thamer M. Melton 3rd, L.J. Medical expenditures for the treatment of osteoporotic fractures in the United States in 1995. Report from the National Osteoporosis Foundation.J. Bone Miner.

Emerging therapeutic opportunities for skeletal restoration.Nat. Rev.

However, it is estimated that 10% of all fractures in the United States show impaired healing (3Jørgensen N.R. Schwarz P. Effects of anti-osteoporosis medications on fracture healing.Curr. Osteoporos. Rep. 2011; 9: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a figure that is likely higher in the aged population (4Gruber R. Koch H. Doll B.A. Tegtmeier F. Einhorn T.A.

The maintenance of bone is a complex balance of anabolism and catabolism, and the enhanced differentiation of new osteoblasts from their precursors, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), is one potential therapeutic target (7Mauney J.R. Volloch V. Kaplan D.L. Role of adult mesenchymal stem cells in bone tissue engineering applications. Current status and future prospects.Tissue Eng. 2005; 11: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). PTH has been particularly well studied, because it is a major regulator of bone metabolism. PTH signals through a Gαs/αq-protein-coupled receptor and therefore signals, at least partially, through cAMP and PKA (8Naot D. Cornish J. The role of peptides and receptors of the calcitonin family in the regulation of bone metabolism.Bone. 2008; 43: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Datta N.S. Abou-Samra A.B. PTH and PTHrP signaling in osteoblasts.Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In studying the mechanism of PTH action, cAMP has come to the forefront as an important signaling modulator for bone homeostasis, in particular osteoblast differentiation. To study the role of cAMP in osteoblast differentiation, investigators have pharmacologically manipulated intracellular cAMP levels or PKA activity in a variety of cell lines and primary cells, showing somewhat contradicting results. A large number of these studies have shown cAMP to positively affect osteoblast differentiation (10Ghayor C. Ehrbar M. San Miguel B. Grätz K.W.

Bone morphogenetic protein activities are enhanced by 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate through suppression of Smad6 expression in osteoprogenitor cells.Bone. 2006; 38: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), although several have shown cAMP to be inhibitory (14Siddappa R. Mulder W. Steeghs I. van de Klundert C. Fernandes H. Liu J. Arends R. van Blitterswijk C. de Boer J. cAMP/PKA signaling inhibits osteogenic differentiation and bone formation in rodent models.Tissue Eng.

Physiol. 2009; 221: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, these conflicting results are likely due to how cAMP is modulated, the concentration of intracellular cAMP achieved, and the duration of time that it remains elevated. For example, it was found that 10 μm forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, inhibited the differentiation of rat calvarial cells, whereas 1 nm increased differentiation (16Turksen K. Grigoriadis A.E. Heersche J.N. Aubin J.E. Forskolin has biphasic effects on osteoprogenitor cell differentiation in vitro.J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The A2BAR is also a Gαs/αq-protein-coupled receptor. This receptor is activated when adenosine concentrations are in the micromolar range. Injury to bone results in increased extracellular ATP (17Hoebertz A. Arnett T.R. Burnstock G.

Human osteoblast precursors produce extracellular adenosine, which modulates their secretion of IL-6 and osteoprotegerin.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Others have studied the role of adenosine receptors on MSC differentiation to osteoblasts. Cultured bone marrow cells derived from patients undergoing hip replacement showed the A2BAR to be expressed and that this increased during osteogenesis (18Costa M.A. Barbosa A. Neto E. Sá-e-Sousa A. Freitas R. Neves J.M. Magalhães-Cardoso T. Ferreirinha F. Correia-de-Sá P. On the role of subtype selective adenosine receptor agonists during proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human primary bone marrow stromal cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2011; 226: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on expression and measurements of cAMP levels after agonist treatments of rat MSCs, Gharibi et al. (21Gharibi B. Abraham A.A. Ham J. Evans B.A. Adenosine receptor subtype expression and activation influence the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts and adipocytes.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2011; 26: 2112-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) concluded that the A2BAR is the dominant receptor, relative to other adenosine receptors, and that its expression increases during differentiation. In human bone marrow-derived MSCs, A2BAR activation increased osteoblast differentiation, as determined by an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity (18Costa M.A. Barbosa A. Neto E. Sá-e-Sousa A. Freitas R. Neves J.M. Magalhães-Cardoso T. Ferreirinha F. Correia-de-Sá P. On the role of subtype selective adenosine receptor agonists during proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human primary bone marrow stromal cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2011; 226: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similarly, in rat bone marrow-derived MSCs, activation of the A2BAR increased Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase expression, as well as the staining of mineralized nodules with alizarin red (21Gharibi B. Abraham A.A. Ham J. Evans B.A. Adenosine receptor subtype expression and activation influence the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts and adipocytes.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2011; 26: 2112-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These studies, however, relied on pharmacological approaches with a focus on in vitro systems and no verification of bone homeostasis in vivo. Here, we show that the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts is impaired in A2BAR KO mice and that pharmacological activation of the A2BAR in bone marrow-derived MSCs can promote osteoblast differentiation, at least partially via cAMP signaling. In accordance, base-line bone density and bone fracture physiology are compromised in A2BAR KO mice. All of the procedures were performed according to the Guidelines for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health. Throughout this study, all of the animals received humane care that was in agreement with the guidelines of and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the Boston University School of Medicine. A2BAR KO mice were originally generated in our laboratory, bred onto C57BL/6J, and confirmed, also in our laboratory, by Bax MaxPCR-based gene marker analysis using MAX-BAX (Charles River Laboratories) (19Yang D.

Age-, strain-, and sex-matched wild type and A2BAR KO mice were used in all experiments. The time course of fracture healing had been established in this fracture model by both histological and selected candidate gene profiling (24Gerstenfeld L.C. Cullinane D.M. Barnes G.L. Graves D.T.

The protein was measured by Bradford assay. For monitoring the effect on gene expression, the agonists were added to the culture at the time of osteoinduction, and RNA was collected after 24 h. For monitoring the effect on nodule formation, agonists were added at the time of osteoinduction and at the second medium change. The nodules were counted on day 6 of osteoinduction. A closed mid-diaphyseal fracture of the left femur was generated by controlled blunt trauma using a scaled down modification of the apparatus described by Bonnarens and Einhorn (29Bonnarens F. Einhorn T.A. Production of a standard closed fracture in laboratory animal bone.J. Orthop. Res. 1984; 2: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The mice were anesthetized, and a medial parapatellar skin incision was made, followed by a medial parapatellar incision into the quadriceps to the patellar ligament insertion, preserving the patellar ligament intact. An intramedullary pin entry point was created in the femur using a 25-gauge needle and then an intramedullary pin (the guide pin of a 25-gauge spinal needle) was inserted into the intramedullary space. The pin was cut, and the patellar ligament was returned to the original position. The skin was sutured with 3.0 suture. A subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg/kg buprenorphine and 0.1 mg/kg penicillin was given to each mouse. For enrollment in our studies, the location and quality of fractures were assessed by x-ray analysis immediately after the fractures had been generated. A fracture whose configuration was inconsistent with our standardized placement criteria was not used in our studies. The mice were monitored and checked daily. The time course of fracture healing had been established in this fracture model by both histological and selected candidate gene profiling, as described in Refs. 24Gerstenfeld L.C. Cullinane D.M.

Briefly, the animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. The fractured femurs were collected, and those designated for microcomputed tomography (micro-CT; n = 5 WT and A2BAR KOs) were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 7 days. Femurs designated for RNA extraction (n = 5 WT controls and A2BAR KOs) were cut at a distance of 5 mm on either side of the fracture. These fracture calluses were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored in −80 °C until they were used for RNA isolation. For base-line measurements, the femurs of WT and A2BAR KO mice were collected and fixed for micro-CT and histology, or the mid-diaphyseal region was dissected out and stored for RNA isolation. Histology was carried out on callus tissues obtained on days 14 and 21 postfracture. The femurs were decalcified in 14% (w/v) EDTA and embedded in paraffin, and 5-micron transverse sections were taken. The slides were stained with Fast Green and safranin O and counterstained with hematoxylin. The figures are composites of multiple images taken at 4× magnification. Immunohistochemistry for collagen type II, α1 (Col2a1) and aggrecan was performed after antigen retrieval with pepsin or chondroitinase, respectively. Primary antibodies were mouse anti-chicken Col2a1 and rabbit anti-mouse aggrecan (Millipore). Staining was detected using (3,3′-diaminobenzidine) peroxidase substrate kit for peroxidase (Vector Laboratories). For growth plate analysis, 4-week-old femurs were processed, sectioned, and stained as above. Histological measurements were made, as previously described (31Börjesson A.E. Lagerquist M.K. Liu C.

Res. 2010; 25: 2690-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), on the central three-fourths of the growth plate, and the lengths of the growth plate, proliferating zone, and hypertrophic zone were calculated as an average of 20 measurements per growth plate. Micro-CT analysis of mouse femurs has been previously described (30Wigner N.A. Luderer H.F. Cox M.K. Sooy K. Gerstenfeld L.C. Demay M.B. Acute phosphate restriction leads to impaired fracture healing and resistance to BMP-2.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2010; 25: 724-733PubMed Google Scholar). Fractured bones were prepared for scanning by removal of the intramedullary pins. The scans were performed using a Scanco μCT 40 system (Scanco Medical, Basserdorf, Switzerland) located in the Orthopaedic and Developmental Biomechanics Laboratory at Boston University. The scans were performed using a 12-micron voxel size resolution with 200 ms of integration time, under conditions of 55 E(KVp) and 145 I(μA). Reference lines were manually adjusted on each individual bone to include the entire callus area. Transverse images scanned by the micro-CT were then traced manually with a computer program and stacked to render a three-dimensional image of the callus or midshaft in the case of the nonfractured bone. Subsequent analysis of the scans was carried out using the software program supplied by the manufacturer of the micro-CT instrument. Measurements of callus density (volume fraction and mineral density) were made directly from the micro-CT image data of each specimen. For these measurements, the callus (including the portion of the callus in the medullary canal) was first isolated using a semi-automated segmentation procedure that excludes the original cortex. A global threshold algorithm was then used that applies a fixed, constant threshold to all specimens. A constrained three-dimensional Gaussian filter (filter width = 0.8, filter support = 1 voxel) was used to partially suppress image noise. The total callus volume, mineralized volume fraction, and mineral density were then calculated using standard algorithms provided by the system manufacturer. The mineral density was calculated with the aid of a standard curve obtained from weekly scans of a set of hydroxyapatite phantoms of five different mineral densities. To measure growth parameters, the right femurs of WT and A2BAR KO mice at 4, 8, and 15 weeks of age were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and then scanned and analyzed as above. For cortical bone analysis, 0.6 mm at the middle of the bone was analyzed, and for trabecular bone analysis, 1.0 mm at the distal metaphysis was analyzed. The mouse bone marrow cultures were grown in osteoinductive media for 6 days. The cultures were washed with PBS, lyophilized, and shipped to the Musculoskeletal Repair and Regeneration Core Center at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York for analysis. Freshly dried (120 °C, 24 h) KBr (200 mg) was mixed with the samples, and pellets were made for spectroscopic analysis. For FTIR spectroscopy, samples from tissue culture wells were pooled. The specimens were scanned in transmittance on a Nicolet 4700 FTIR spectrometer. The spectra were collected from 400 to 2,000 cm−1. First, a base line for the spectra was determined, and the mineral to matrix ratio was determined as the area under the phosphate peak (900–1,200 cm−1) divided by the area under the amide I peak (1,585–1,720 cm−1) (32Pleshko N. Boskey A. Mendelsohn R. Novel infrared spectroscopic method for the determination of crystallinity of hydroxyapatite minerals.Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 786-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Total RNA isolation was prepared from (n = 5) fractured calluses harvested on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 postinjury in the following manner. The specimens were powdered in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol, as previously described (25Kon T. Cho T.J. Aizawa T. Yamazaki M. Nooh N. Graves D. Gerstenfeld L.C. Einhorn T.A. Expression of osteoprotegerin, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (osteoprotegerin ligand) and related proinflammatory cytokines during fracture healing.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). RNA was redissolved in TRIzol and extracted a second time. After isopropanol precipitation, RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water and further purified by using RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen). For cell culture, RNA was isolated with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was reverse transcribed (Applied Biosystems), and gene expression was measured with Applied Biosystems reagents on an Applied Biosystems 7700 sequence detector. All of the gene expression assays used were TaqMan MGB expression assays with β-actin or 18 S rRNA used as endogenous controls. Gene expression relative to WT d0 or to vehicle treatment was calculated by the ΔΔCT method. The data are presented as the means ± standard deviation. n represents the number of individual experiments with mouse/group, and each experiment is typically done in duplicates. Statistical comparison was done using two-tail Student's t test assuming equal variance or, when appropriate, a two-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison test was applied. The data are considered significant when p ≤ 0.05 (*). Analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism5 software.

We tested the hypothesis that older males (OMs, 70 ±4 yr, n=9) would have a blunted myogenic response to a physiological stimulus compared to younger controls (21 ±3 yr, n=9). Subjects completed an acute bout of intense unilateral muscle loading. Young healthy males matched for body mass and activity level served as the control group. Muscle biopsies and blood were obtained before and at 3, 24, and 48 h after muscle loading. The muscle stem cell response was analyzed using flow cytometry, immunofluorescent microscopy, and standard protein and mRNA analysis. OMs had 35% fewer basal stem cells and a type II fiber-specific impairment in stem cell content and proliferation. Myogenic determination factor staining and cell cycle analysis illustrated a severely blunted progression through the myogenic program. Myostatin protein and mRNA were 2-fold higher in OMs. Stem cell-specific myostatin levels were not different at baseline; however, there were 67% more myostatin-positive type II-associated stem cells in OMs at 24 h. These data illustrate an age-related impairment of stem cell function in a fiber type-specific manner. The greater colocalization of myostatin with stem cells provides a mechanism for the impaired myogenic capacity of aged muscle.—McKay, B. R., Ogborn, D. I., Bellamy, L. M., Tarnopolsky, M.

https://openalex.org/W2044802296,"Little is known about the molecular basis of differences in behavior among individuals. Here we report consistent novelty-seeking behavior, across different contexts, among honey bees in their tendency to scout for food sources and nest sites, and we reveal some of the molecular underpinnings of this behavior relative to foragers that do not scout. Food scouts showed extensive differences in brain gene expression relative to other foragers, including differences related to catecholamine, glutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid signaling. Octopamine and glutamate treatments increased the likelihood of scouting, whereas dopamine antagonist treatment decreased it. These findings demonstrate intriguing similarities in human and insect novelty seeking and suggest that this trait, which presumably evolved independently in these two lineages, may be subserved by conserved molecular components."

The dendrites of these neurons were truly passive and acted as linear cables. Gap junctions were distributed nonuniformly on the Golgi cell surface, with a higher density on distal dendrites. Thus, gap junction-mediated lateral excitation preferentially enhanced the distal inputs, enabling distal synapses to drive network activity more effectively."

https://openalex.org/W2048227985,"Mitochondrial membranes maintain a specific phospholipid composition. Most phospholipids are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to mitochondria, but cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine are produced in mitochondria. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phospholipid exchange between the ER and mitochondria relies on the ER-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) complex, which physically connects the ER and mitochondrial outer membrane. However, the proteins and mechanisms involved in phospholipid transport within mitochondria remain elusive. Here, we investigated the role of the conserved intermembrane space proteins, Ups1p and Ups2p, and an inner membrane protein, Mdm31p, in phospholipid metabolism. Our data show that loss of the ERMES complex, Ups1p, and Mdm31p causes similar defects in mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism, mitochondrial morphology, and cell growth. Defects in cells lacking the ERMES complex or Ups1p are suppressed by Mdm31p overexpression as well as additional loss of Ups2p, which antagonizes Ups1p. Combined loss of the ERMES complex and Ups1p exacerbates phospholipid defects. Finally, pulse-chase experiments using [(14)C]serine revealed that Ups1p and Ups2p antagonistically regulate conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. Our results suggest that Ups proteins and Mdm31p play important roles in phospholipid biosynthesis in mitochondria. Ups proteins may function in phospholipid trafficking between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes."

There is increased risk for poor fetal outcomes, including preterm delivery, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, respiratory distress, fetal distress and demise.One hundred and one women diagnosed with ICP between January 2005 and March 2009 at San Francisco General Hospital were included in this study. Single predictor logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of maternal clinical and biochemical predictors with fetal complications. Clinical predictors analyzed included age, race/ethnicity, gravidity, parity, history of liver or biliary disease, history of ICP in previous pregnancies, and induction. Biochemical predictors analyzed included serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin, total protein, and total bile acids (TBA).The prevalence of ICP was 1.9%. Most were Latina (90%). Labor was induced in the majority (87%) and most were delivered by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery (84%). Fetal complications occurred in 33% of the deliveries, with respiratory distress accounting for the majority of complications. There were no statistically significant clinical or biochemical predictors associated with an increased risk of fetal complications. Elevated TBA had little association with fetal complications until reaching greater than 100 µmoL/L, with 3 out of 5 having reported complications. ICP in previous pregnancies was associated with decreased risk of fetal complications (OR 0.21, p = 0.046). There were no cases of late term fetal demise.Maternal clinical and laboratory features, including elevated TBA, did not appear to be substantial predictors of fetal complications in ICP."
https://openalex.org/W2048084175,"The predominant brain microtubule-associated proteins MAP2 and tau play a critical role in microtubule cytoskeletal organization and function. We have previously reported that PP2A/Bα, a major protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme, binds to and dephosphorylates tau, and regulates microtubule stability. Here, we provide evidence that MAP2 co-purifies with and is dephosphorylated by endogenous PP2A/Bα in bovine gray matter. It co-localizes with PP2A/Bα in immature and mature human neuronal cell bodies. PP2A co-immunoprecipitates with and directly interacts with MAP2. Using in vitro binding assays, we show that PP2A/Bα binds to MAP2c isoforms through a region encompassing the microtubule-binding domain and upstream proline-rich region. Tau and MAP2 compete for binding to and dephosphorylation by PP2A/Bα. Remarkably, the protein-tyrosine kinase Fyn, which binds to the proline-rich RTPPKSP motif conserved in both MAP2 and tau, inhibits the interaction of PP2A/Bα with either tau or MAP2c. The corresponding synthetic RTPPKSP peptide, but not the phosphorylated RpTPPKSP version, competes with Tau and MAP2c for binding to PP2A/Bα. Significantly, down-regulation of PP2A/Bα and deregulation of Fyn-Tau protein interactions have been linked to enhanced tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. Together, our results suggest that PP2A/Bα is part of segregated MAP2 and tau signaling scaffolds that can coordinate the action of key kinases and phosphatases involved in modulating neuronal plasticity.

We show here that, as observed with tau, endogenous PP2A/Bα can co-purify with, directly bind to and dephosphorylate MAP2. Significantly, a conserved proline-rich Fyn-binding motif in MAP2 and tau plays a critical role in regulating the interaction of PP2A/Bα with both MAPs. Our data underscore the importance of both MAP2 and tau as multivalent, compartmentalized anchoring proteins for major signaling enzymes like PP2A/Bα and Fyn.

In parallel, PP2A activity was measured in 10 μl aliquots of the collected fractions.

HIV viral protein R (Vpr) is a potent apoptosis-inducing agent for primary monocytes. Because the biologically active Vpr is found in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of HIV-infected patients, we investigated the apoptotic effect of Vpr on monocyte-derived macrophages and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-activated THP1 macrophages. Our results show that primary monocytes and THP1 cells develop resistance to Vpr-induced apoptosis following differentiation into macrophages. To determine the effect of Vpr on the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, we show that in contrast to the undifferentiated cells, Vpr did not down-regulate the expression of antiapoptotic inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) and Bcl2 family members in macrophages, suggesting their involvement in resistance to Vpr-induced apoptosis. However, knocking down Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 proteins induced spontaneous apoptosis with no impact on susceptibility to Vpr-induced apoptosis. In contrast, down-regulation of cellular IAP1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2 by using siRNAs and SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) mimetic sensitized macrophages to Vpr-induced apoptosis. Overall, our results suggest that resistance to Vpr-induced apoptosis is specifically mediated by cIAP1/2 genes independent of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, which play a key role in maintaining cell viability.

https://openalex.org/W2089319358,"S100 proteins promote cancer cell migration and metastasis. To investigate their roles in the process of migration we have constructed inducible systems for S100P in rat mammary and human HeLa cells that show a linear relationship between its intracellular levels and cell migration. S100P, like S100A4, differentially interacts with the isoforms of nonmuscle myosin II (NMIIA, Kd = 0.5 μm; IIB, Kd = 8 μm; IIC, Kd = 1.0 μm). Accordingly, S100P dissociates NMIIA and IIC filaments but not IIB in vitro. NMIIA knockdown increases migration in non-induced cells and there is no further increase upon induction of S100P, whereas NMIIB knockdown reduces cell migration whether or not S100P is induced. NMIIC knockdown does not affect S100P-enhanced cell migration. Further study shows that NMIIA physically interacts with S100P in living cells. In the cytoplasm, S100P occurs in discrete nodules along NMIIA-containing filaments. Induction of S100P causes more peripheral distribution of NMIIA filaments. This change is paralleled by a significant drop in vinculin-containing, actin-terminating focal adhesion sites (FAS) per cell. The induction of S100P, consequently, causes significant reduction in cellular adhesion. Addition of a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor reduces disassembly of FAS and thereby suppresses S100P-enhanced cell migration. In conclusion, this work has demonstrated a mechanism whereby the S100P-induced dissociation of NMIIA filaments leads to a weakening of FAS, reduced cell adhesion, and enhanced cell migration, the first major step in the metastatic cascade.

Bresnick A.R. The S100A4 metastasis factor regulates cellular motility via a direct interaction with myosin-IIA.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5173-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, the interaction of S100A4 with NMIIB is much weaker (22Li Z.H. Spektor A. Varlamova O. Bresnick A.R. Mts1 regulates the assembly of nonmuscle myosin-IIA.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14258-14266Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In different cellular systems, when expression of NMIIA is knocked down, cell migration is increased, but when NMIIB is knocked down, cell migration is reduced (23Even-Ram S. Doyle A.D. Conti M.A. Matsumoto K. Adelstein R.S. Yamada K.M. Myosin IIA regulates cell motility and actomyosin-microtubule cross-talk.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that S100A4 and perhaps other S100 proteins may interact differentially and regulate these different NMII isoforms to achieve an overall increase in cell migration, but how the overall increase is achieved is unknown. To test how this is brought about, S100P has been used as a representative of the S100 proteins, because its metastasis-promoting property has been well characterized in vivo (7Wang G. Platt-Higgins A. Carroll J. de Silva Rudland S. Winstanley J. Barraclough R. Rudland P.S. Induction of metastasis by S100P in a rat mammary model and its association with poor survival of breast cancer patients.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and S100P-inducible cell lines have been successfully established from a rat breast tumor cell line and HeLa ovarian cancer cells. We now show that S100P also binds preferentially to NMIIA, partially dissociates its filaments and causes their redistribution, and that these changes are accompanied by a redistribution of FAS, from the central area to the cellular periphery. The number of FAS per cell is also significantly decreased. Consequently cell adhesion is reduced and cell migration is enhanced. These changes suggest that the weakening of the anchoring forces generated through NMIIA to FAS will allow intact NMIIB filaments to drive cell migration. The Rama 37 cells, a nonmetastatic benign rat mammary tumor cell line expressing undetectable levels of S100P, S100P cDNA transfected cell lines (Rama 37-S100P-1, -2; Rama 37 pool-1, -2), and the control vector alone transfected cell line (Rama 37-vector), were established and cultured as described previously (7Wang G.

Two inducible clones derived from Rama 37 cells were termed Rama 37-T25 and -T28, whereas two inducible clones derived from HeLa cells were termed HeLa-A3 and -A19. The concentration of doxycycline and the induction period were optimized and 1 μg/ml of doxycycline for 24 h was used in all the inductions (supplemental Fig. S1). Migration of cell lines was measured 24 h after the cells were seeded in Boyden chambers using 6.5-mm diameter polycarbonate membrane inserts containing 8-μm pores (Corning Costar) (26Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N.

Martin-Fernandez M. Rudland P.S. Barraclough R. Mutually antagonistic actions of S100A4 and S100A1 on normal and metastatic phenotypes.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1445-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The inducing agent, doxycycline, inhibitors, or blocking peptide and antibodies were added to both the upper and lower compartments of the Boyden chambers. To standardize results between different experiments, usually the cell line controls were set to 100% migration and changes relative to this value were shown in most figures. Two siRNA sequences used for targeted silencing of human S100P and four siRNA sequences for each human NMII isoform, vinculin, Rac1, and RhoA were designed and synthesized by Qiagen (supplemental Table S1). S100P-expressing MCF-7 and HeLa/HeLa-A3/HeLa-A19 cell lines were used for testing S100P siRNAs, NMII siRNAs, vinculin, Rac1 and RhoA siRNAs, respectively. The RNAi Starter kit (301799), including RNAiFect, negative control siRNA, were from Qiagen. The siRNA transfection procedure followed instructions from Qiagen. At 48 h after transfection, the levels of S100P, NMIIA and -IIB (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B), vinculin, Rac1, and RhoA were measured using Western blotting and the levels of NMIIC mRNA (supplemental Fig. 2C) by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, because there was no satisfactory antibody for NMIIC. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was carried out using a cloned AMV First-strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNA was used as template for the amplification of actin (18 cycle) and NMIIC (25 cycle) by PCR using the primers listed in supplemental Table S2. The recombinant human S100P protein was purified as described previously (28Wang G. Zhang S. Fernig D.G. Spiller D. Martin-Fernandez M. Zhang H. Ding Y. Rao Z. Rudland P.S. Barraclough R.

The rC-NMIIA (C-terminal 149 amino acids), IIB (C-terminal 204 amino acids), and IIC (C-terminal 178 amino acids) were produced using the same method as used previously for rC-NMIIA (30Chen H.

The deletion mutants of rC-NMIIA, -M1, -M2, -M3, -M4, and -M5 were produced by the PCR extension method (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

S100P was detected using mouse anti-S100P mAb (1:50 dilution) (BD Biosciences), which showed no cross-reaction with S100A1, S100A2, or S100A4 (7Wang G. Platt-Higgins A. Carroll J. de Silva Rudland S.

FAK was isolated using anti-FAK-conjugated agarose (Millipore, Billerrica, MA) from 1 mg of protein prior to SDS-PAGE. NMIIA, -IIB, FAK, phospho-FAK (pFAK), and actin were detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-NMIIA and -IIB (Covance, Princeton, NJ), mAb-FAK and polyclonal anti-pFAK Tyr(397) (Upstate, New York). Briefly, equal amounts of proteins (3 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). One gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to check equal loading and the other two gels were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes, which were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with S100A4 (3 μg/ml) or S100P (3 μg/ml) in Overlay Buffer (12Kriajevska M.V.

Binding reactions were carried out in an IAsys two-channel resonant mirror biosensor (Affinity Sensors, Saxon Hill, Cambridge, United Kingdom), as described previously (34Fernig D.G. Optical biosensor techniques to analyze protein-polysaccharide interactions.Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 505-518PubMed Google Scholar); the rC-NMIIA, -IIB, or -IIC protein fragments were immobilized on aminosilane surfaces using BS3 (Perbio, Chester, UK). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated both from the association and dissociation rate constants, and from the extent of binding at or near equilibrium (34Fernig D.G. Optical biosensor techniques to analyze protein-polysaccharide interactions.Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 505-518PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μm rC-NMIIA, -IIB, or -IIC was incubated at 4 °C overnight in Bundling buffer (10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2)(35Murakami N. Singh S.S. Chauhan V.P. Elzinga M.

To test the effect of S100P on rC-NMII sedimentation, 0–10 μm S100P was preincubated with rC-NMIIA, -IIB, or -IIC with 0.5 mm CaCl2 at room temperature for 40 min. Bundling buffer was then added and the NaCl and MgCl2 were adjusted to 100 and 2.5 mm, respectively. Twenty μl of mixture was removed and kept at −20 °C as a control, and the remainder was incubated overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 13,600 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, 20 μl of the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE together with control. Anti-His tag antibody (Sigma) was used to detect rC-NMIIA, -IIB, and -IIC by Western blotting. To test if S100P disassociates the preformed NMII filaments, the rC-NMIIA, -IIB, and -IIC were incubated in Bundling buffer for 48 h. After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in Bundling buffer containing 0 and 3 μm S100P. After 40 min incubation, the mixtures were centrifuged and the resultant supernatants were analyzed. Culture of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and dual immunofluorescent staining were carried out as described (24Wang G. Rudland P.S. White M.R. Barraclough R. Interaction in vivo and in vitro of the metastasis-inducing S100 protein, S100A4 (p9Ka) with S100A1.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11141-11146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cells were grown on the untreated glass surface of 8-well chamber slides (BD Biosciences). S100P was detected with the mAb (BD Biosciences) at 1:50 dilution and visualized with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma). NMIIA and -IIB were detected with rabbit anti-NMIIA and -IIB IgGs (Covance) at 1:5000 dilution and visualized with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes). Actin filaments were visualized with Atto 647N-Phalloidin (Sigma). FAS were detected with mAb to vinculin (Sigma) at 1:2000 dilution and visualized as for S100P. Images were recorded using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. For fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, the expression plasmids, pECFP-S100P and pNMIIA-EYFP, were constructed by inserting S100P and NMIIA coding sequences into pECFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech) at the HindIII and BamHI sites, respectively. The correct coding sequences for the two fusion proteins, ECFP-S100P and NMIIA-EYFP, were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pECFP-S100P and pNMIIA-EYFP/pEYFP-C1 expression vectors were then co-transfected into HeLa cells. The time-resolved fluorescence decay maps were collected pixel-by-pixel from the HeLa cells co-expressing ECFP-S100P and NMIIA-EYFP fusion proteins or from HeLa cells co-expressing ECFP-S100P and EYFP by a scanning confocal microscope using time-correlated single photon counting (36Pepperkok R. Squire A. Geley S. Bastiaens P.I. Simultaneous detection of multiple green fluorescent proteins in live cells by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.Curr.

Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy images were analyzed using SPCImage 2.0 (Becker & Hickl). The methods for calculation of fluorescence lifetime and the distance between donor and acceptor as well as the statistical analysis are fully described elsewhere (37Zhang S. Wang G. Fernig D.G. Rudland P.S. Webb S.E. Barraclough R. Martin-Fernandez M. Interaction of metastasis-inducing S100A4 protein in vivo by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.Eur. Biophys. J. 2005; 34: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GFP-NMIIA expression plasmid (full-length) was obtained from Addgene. The HeLa-A3 was grown on glass bottom dishes (Matsunami Glass, Tokyo, Japan) and transfected with the plasmid using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Doxycycline (1 μg/ml) was added to the cell culture 16 h after transfection. Images of transfected cells were recorded in a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope for a further 24 h. An equal number of HeLa and HeLa-A19 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 24 h and washed with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then incubated with ice-cold cytoskeletal lysis buffer (40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 3 mm EGTA (pH 7.4)) and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice. The buffer was then removed to a fresh tube and 20 μl was taken for soluble actin detection. The material remaining on the dish after two washes with the buffer was considered as the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction and harvested by adding 2× SDS gel loading buffer. The insoluble NMIIA and soluble actin (as a loading control) were detected by Western blotting. The S100P binding domain of NMIIA fused with TAT-HA2 (38Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Transducible TAT-HA fusogenic peptide enhances escape of TAT fusion proteins after lipid raft macropinocytosis.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar) was synthesized by GeneCust Europe (Luxembourg). TAT-HA2 was used as control peptide. HeLa and HeLa-A19 cells were incubated with 5 μm peptides for 24 h. The cell migration assay was set up in the presence or absence of doxycycline. A modified attachment assay (39Humphries M.J. Cell adhesion assays.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 522: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was carried out. HeLa and HeLa-A19 cells were induced with 1 μg/ml of doxycycline for 24 h. The cells were then detached by EDTA, which was neutralized by culture medium, washed with PBS, and resuspended to 4 × 105/ml in basal medium without serum, 50 μl of cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Costar). After incubation in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 5, 30, 60, or 90 min, the plate was shaken at 2000 rpm for 10–15 s and washed 3 times with PBS. The remaining cells were fixed with 5% (w/v) glutaradehyde. After washing, the cells were stained with crystal violet for 10 min. After washing with water 5 times, the plate was dried and 100 μl 10% (v/v) acetic acid was added. After 30 min incubation, the absorption was recorded at 570 nm. The cell adhesion array kit was purchased from Millipore and used according to the supplier's instructions. When the rat mammary 37 (Rama 37) cells were transfected with an expression vector for S100P, the resultant transfectants, R37-S100P-1 and R37-S100P-2, and two pooled clones, pool-1 and pool-2 (7Wang G.

To down-regulate the levels of S100P, two specific siRNAs to the mRNA for S100P were synthesized and transfected into MCF-7 cells, a human breast cancer cell line that expressed high levels of S100P. siRNA duplexes 1 and 2 separately reduced the levels of S100P in MCF-7 cells to 10 and 80%, respectively, and led to a reduction in cell migration of about 45 and 75%, respectively (p = 0.004 and p = 0.2) (Fig. 1, C and D). To up-regulate the levels of S100P, the doxycycline-inducible cell lines, Rama 37-T25, -T28, and HeLa-A3 and -A19 were constructed from rat mammary benign and human malignant ovarian cells. After addition of 1 μg/ml of doxycycline for 24 h, the level of S100P was significantly increased by 5–10-fold (p ≤ 0.001) and cell migration by 2–3-fold, respectively (p ≤ 0.008) (Fig. 1, E and F). Levels of S100P and migration of Rama 37 and HeLa cells showed no significant differences with or without inducing agent (p ≥ 0.30; Fig. 1, E and F). There was a significant positive correlation between the levels of S100P and cell migration (supplemental Fig. S3). Although there is no secretion signaling peptide in any of the S100 proteins, it is thought that the S100 proteins can be secreted and may function at low concentrations of around 100 nm (1 μg/ml) (40Arumugam T.

https://openalex.org/W1984699310,"Visfatin (also termed pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF) or nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt)) is a pleiotropic mediator acting on many inflammatory processes including osteoarthritis. Visfatin exhibits both an intracellular enzymatic activity (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, Nampt) leading to NAD synthesis and a cytokine function via the binding to its hypothetical receptor. We recently reported the role of visfatin in prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) synthesis in chondrocytes. Here, our aim was to characterize the signaling pathways involved in this response in exploring both the insulin receptor (IR) signaling pathway and Nampt activity. IR was expressed in human and murine chondrocytes, and visfatin triggered Akt phosphorylation in murine chondrocytes. Blocking IR expression with siRNA or activity using the hydroxy-2-naphthalenyl methyl phosphonic acid tris acetoxymethyl ester (HNMPA-(AM)(3)) inhibitor diminished visfatin-induced PGE(2) release in chondrocytes. Moreover, visfatin-induced IGF-1R(-/-) chondrocytes released higher concentration of PGE(2) than IGF-1R(+/+) cells, a finding confirmed with an antibody that blocked IGF-1R. Using RT-PCR, we found that visfatin did not regulate IR expression and that an increased insulin release was also unlikely to be involved because insulin was unable to increase PGE(2) release. Inhibition of Nampt activity using the APO866 inhibitor gradually decreased PGE(2) release, whereas the addition of exogenous nicotinamide increased it. We conclude that the proinflammatory actions of visfatin in chondrocytes involve regulation of IR signaling pathways, possibly through the control of Nampt enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1980550198,"Embryo implantation into the maternal uterus is a crucial step for the successful establishment of mammalian pregnancy. Following the attachment of embryo to the uterine luminal epithelium, uterine stromal cells undergo steroid hormone-dependent decidualization, which is characterized by stromal cell proliferation and differentiation. The mechanisms underlying steroid hormone-induced stromal cell proliferation and differentiation during decidualization are still poorly understood. Ribonucleotide reductase, consisting of two subunits (RRM1 and RRM2), is a rate-limiting enzyme in deoxynucleotide production for DNA synthesis and plays an important role in cell proliferation and tumorgenicity. Based on our microarray analysis, Rrm2 expression was significantly higher at implantation sites compared with interimplantation sites in mouse uterus. However, the expression, regulation, and function of RRM2 in mouse uterus during embryo implantation and decidualization are still unknown. Here we show that although both RRM1 and RRM2 expression are markedly induced in mouse uterine stromal cells undergoing decidualization, only RRM2 is regulated by progesterone, a key regulator of decidualization. Further studies showed that the induction of progesterone on RRM2 expression in stromal cells is mediated by the AKT/c-MYC pathway. RRM2 can also be induced by replication stress and DNA damage during decidualization through the ATR/ATM-CHK1-E2F1 pathway. The weight of implantation sites and deciduoma was effectively reduced by specific inhibitors for RRM2. The expression of decidual/trophoblast prolactin-related protein (Dtprp), a reliable marker for decidualization in mice, was significantly reduced in deciduoma and steroid-induced decidual cells after HU treatment. Therefore, RRM2 may be an important effector of progesterone signaling to induce cell proliferation and decidualization in mouse uterus."

In the present work, we used primary cell cultures and isolated muscles from Trpc1−/− and Trpc1+/+ murine model to investigate the role of Trpc1 in myoblast differentiation and in muscle regeneration. In these models, we studied regeneration consecutive to cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury and observed a significant hypotrophy and a delayed regeneration in Trpc1−/− muscles consisting in smaller fiber size and increased proportion of centrally nucleated fibers. This was accompanied by a decreased expression of myogenic factors such as MyoD, Myf5, and myogenin and of one of their targets, the developmental MHC (MHCd). Consequently, muscle tension was systematically lower in muscles from Trpc1−/− mice. Importantly, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, which plays a crucial role in muscle growth and regeneration, was down-regulated in regenerating Trpc1−/− muscles. Indeed, phosphorylation of both Akt and p70S6K proteins was decreased as well as the activation of PI3K, the main upstream regulator of the Akt. This effect was independent of insulin-like growth factor expression. Akt phosphorylation also was reduced in Trpc1−/− primary myoblasts and in control myoblasts differentiated in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ or pretreated with EGTA-AM or wortmannin, suggesting that the entry of Ca2+ through Trpc1 channels enhanced the activity of PI3K. Our results emphasize the involvement of Trpc1 channels in skeletal muscle development in vitro and in vivo, and identify a Ca2+-dependent activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway during myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2035846202,"The accepted androgen receptor (AR) role is to promote proliferation and survival of prostate epithelium and thus prostate cancer progression. While growth-inhibitory, tumor-suppressive AR effects have also been documented, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we for the first time link AR anti-cancer action with cell senescence in vitro and in vivo. First, AR-driven senescence was p53-independent. Instead, AR induced p21, which subsequently reduced ΔN isoform of p63. Second, AR activation increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby suppressed Rb phosphorylation. Both pathways were critical for senescence as was proven by p21 and Rb knock-down and by quenching ROS with N-Acetyl cysteine and p63 silencing also mimicked AR-induced senescence. The two pathways engaged in a cross-talk, likely via PML tumor suppressor, whose localization to senescence-associated chromatin foci was increased by AR activation. All these pathways contributed to growth arrest, which resolved in senescence due to concomitant lack of p53 and high mTOR activity. This is the first demonstration of senescence response caused by a nuclear hormone receptor."

To better regulate these sialoproteins, we asked whether endothelial cells (ECs) might express one or more catalytically active sialidases. Human lung microvascular EC lysates contained heat-labile sialidase activity for a fluorogenic substrate, 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4-MU-NANA), that was dose-dependently inhibited by the competitive sialidase inhibitor, 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid but not its negative control. The EC lysates also contained sialidase activity for a ganglioside mixture. Using real time RT-PCR to detect mRNAs for the four known mammalian sialidases, NEU1, -2, -3, and -4, NEU1 mRNA was expressed at levels 2700-fold higher that those found for NEU2, -3, or -4. Western analyses indicated NEU1 and -3 protein expression. Using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, NEU1 was immunolocalized to both the plasma membrane and the perinuclear region. NEU3 was detected both in the cytosol and nucleus. Prior siRNA-mediated knockdown of NEU1 and NEU3 each decreased EC sialidase activity for 4-MU-NANA by >65 and >17%, respectively, and for the ganglioside mixture by 0 and 40%, respectively. NEU1 overexpression in ECs reduced their migration into a wound by >40%, whereas NEU3 overexpression did not. Immunohistochemical studies of normal human tissues immunolocalized NEU1 and NEU3 proteins to both pulmonary and extrapulmonary vascular endothelia. These combined data indicate that human lung microvascular ECs as well as other endothelia express catalytically active NEU1 and NEU3. NEU1 restrains EC migration, whereas NEU3 does not."

In Escherichia coli, TatA, TatB, and TatC are essential components of the machinery. A complex of TatB and TatC acts as the substrate receptor, whereas TatA is proposed to form the Tat transport channel. TatA and TatB are related proteins that comprise an N-terminal transmembrane helix and an adjacent amphipathic helix. Previous studies addressing the topological organization of TatA have given conflicting results. In this study, we have addressed the topological arrangement of TatA and TatB in intact cells by labeling of engineered cysteine residues with the membrane-impermeable thiol reagent methoxypolyethylene glycol maleimide. Our results show that TatA and TatB share an N-out, C-in topology, with no evidence that the amphipathic helices of either protein are exposed at the periplasmic side of the membrane. We further show that the N-out, C-in topology of TatA is fixed and is not affected by the absence of other Tat components or by the overproduction of a Tat substrate. These data indicate that topological reorganization of TatA is unlikely to accompany Tat-dependent protein transport."

Members of this phylum actively enter host cells by a multistep process with the help of microneme protein (MIC) complexes that play important roles in motility, host cell attachment, moving junction formation, and invasion. T. gondii (Tg)MIC1-4-6 complex is the most extensively investigated microneme complex, which contributes to host cell recognition and attachment via the action of TgMIC1, a sialic acid-binding adhesin. Here, we report the structure of TgMIC4 and reveal its carbohydrate-binding specificity to a variety of galactose-containing carbohydrate ligands. The lectin is composed of six apple domains in which the fifth domain displays a potent galactose-binding activity, and which is cleaved from the complex during parasite invasion. We propose that galactose recognition by TgMIC4 may compromise host protection from galectin-mediated activation of the host immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2068792537,"The kidney maintains water homeostasis by modulating aquaporin 2 (AQP2) on the plasma membrane of collecting duct principal cells in response to vasopressin (VP). VP mediated phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256 is critical for this effect. However, the role of phosphorylation of other serine residues in the AQP2 C-terminus is less well understood. Here, we examined the effect of phosphorylation of S256, S261 and S269 on AQP2 trafficking and association with recycling pathway markers. We used LLC-PK1 cells expressing AQP2(S-D) or (S-A) phospho mutants and a 20°C cold block, which allows endocytosis to continue, but prevents protein exit from the trans Golgi network (TGN), inducing formation of a perinuclear AQP2 patch. AQP2-S256D persists on the plasma membrane during cold block, while wild type AQP2, AQP2-S256A, S261A, S269A and S269D are internalized and accumulate in the patch. Development of this patch, a measure of AQP2 internalization, was most rapid with AQP2-S256A, and slowest with S261A and S269D. AQP2-S269D exhibited a biphasic internalization profile with a significant amount not internalized until 150 minutes of cold block. After rewarming to 37°C, wt AQP2, AQP2-S261A and AQP2-S269D rapidly redistributed throughout the cytoplasm within 20 minutes, whereas AQP2-S256A dissipated more slowly. Colocalization of AQP2 mutants with several key vesicular markers including clathrin, HSP70/HSC70, EEA, GM130 and Rab11 revealed no major differences. Overall, our data provide evidence supporting the role of S256 and S269 in the maintenance of AQP2 at the cell surface and reveal the dynamics of internalization and recycling of differentially phosphorylated AQP2 in cell culture."
https://openalex.org/W2034762461,"F(1)-ATPase (F(1)) is an ATP-driven rotary motor wherein the γ subunit rotates against the surrounding α(3)β(3) stator ring. The 3 catalytic sites of F(1) reside on the interface of the α and β subunits of the α(3)β(3) ring. While the catalytic residues predominantly reside on the β subunit, the α subunit has 1 catalytically critical arginine, termed the arginine finger, with stereogeometric similarities with the arginine finger of G-protein-activating proteins. However, the principal role of the arginine finger of F(1) remains controversial. We studied the role of the arginine finger by analyzing the rotation of a mutant F(1) with a lysine substitution of the arginine finger. The mutant showed a 350-fold longer catalytic pause than the wild-type; this pause was further lengthened by the slowly hydrolyzed ATP analog ATPγS. On the other hand, the mutant F(1) showed highly unidirectional rotation with a coupling ratio of 3 ATPs/turn, the same as wild-type, suggesting that cooperative torque generation by the 3 β subunits was not impaired. The hybrid F(1) carrying a single copy of the α mutant revealed that the reaction step slowed by the mutation occurs at +200° from the binding angle of the mutant subunit. Thus, the principal role of the arginine finger is not to mediate cooperativity among the catalytic sites, but to enhance the rate of the ATP cleavage by stabilizing the transition state of ATP hydrolysis. Lysine substitution also caused frequent pauses because of severe ADP inhibition, and a slight decrease in ATP-binding rate."
https://openalex.org/W2092185159,"NaV1.5 is a cardiac voltage-gated Na+ channel αsubunit and is encoded by the SCN5a gene. The activity of this channel determines cardiac depolarization and electrical conduction. Channel defects, including mutations and decrease of channel protein levels, have been linked to the development of cardiac arrhythmias. The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of NaV1.5 expression are largely unknown. Forkhead box O (Foxo) proteins are transcriptional factors that bind the consensus DNA sequences in their target gene promoters and regulate the expression of these genes. Comparative analysis revealed conserved DNA sequences, 5′-CAAAACA-3′ (insulin responsive element, IRE), in rat, mouse and human SCN5a promoters with the latter two containing two overlapping Foxo protein binding IREs, 5′-CAAAACAAAACA-3′. This finding led us to hypothesize that Foxo1 regulates NaV1.5 expression by directly binding the SCN5a promoter and affecting its transcriptional activity. In the present study, we determined whether Foxo1 regulates NaV1.5 expression at the transcriptional level and also defined the role of Foxo1 in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated NaV1.5 suppression in HL-1 cardiomyocytes using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), constitutively nuclear Foxo1 expression, and RNAi Foxo1 knockdown as well as whole cell voltage-clamp recordings. ChIP with anti-Foxo1 antibody and follow-up semi-quantitative PCR with primers flanking Foxo1 binding sites in the proximal SCN5a promoter region clearly demonstrated enrichment of DNA, confirming Foxo1 recruitment to this consensus sequence. Foxo1 mutant (T24A/S319A-GFP, Foxo1-AA-GFP) was retained in nuclei, leading to a decrease of NaV1.5 expression and Na+ current, while silencing of Foxo1 expression by RNAi resulted in the augmentation of NaV1.5 expression. H2O2 significantly reduced NaV1.5 expression by promoting Foxo1 nuclear localization and this reduction was prevented by RNAi silencing Foxo1 expression. These studies indicate that Foxo1 negatively regulates NaV1.5 expression in cardiomyocytes and reactive oxygen species suppress NaV1.5 expression through Foxo1."

Lack of AnxA6 in chondrocytes led to a decreased intracellular Ca2+ concentration and protein kinase C α (PKCα) activity, ultimately resulting in reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities. The 45 C-terminal amino acids of AnxA6 (AnxA6(1–627)) were responsible for the direct binding of AnxA6 to PKCα. Consequently, transfection of AnxA6−/− chondrocytes with full-length AnxA6 rescued the reduced expression of terminal differentiation markers, whereas transfection of AnxA6−/− chondrocytes with AnxA6(1–627) did not or only partially rescued the decreased mRNA levels of terminal differentiation markers. In addition, lack of AnxA6 in matrix vesicles, which initiate the mineralization process in growth plate cartilage, resulted in reduced alkaline phosphatase activity and Ca2+ and inorganic phosphate (Pi) content and the inability to form hydroxyapatite-like crystals in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2078232420,"Although it is well established that ubiquitin-like modifications are tightly regulated, it has been unclear how their E1 activities are controlled. In this study, we found that the SAE2 subunit of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E1 is autoSUMOylated at residue Lys-236, and SUMOylation was catalyzed by Ubc9 at several additional Lys residues surrounding the catalytic Cys-173 of SAE2. AutoSUMOylation of SAE2 did not affect SUMO adenylation or formation of E1·SUMO thioester, but did significantly inhibit the transfer of SUMO from E1 to E2 and overall SUMO conjugations to target proteins due to the altered interaction between E1 and E2. Upon heat shock, SUMOylation of SAE2 was reduced, which corresponded with an increase in global SUMOylation, suggesting that SUMOylation of the Cys domain of SAE2 is a mechanism for ""storing"" a pool of E1 that can be quickly activated in response to environmental changes. This study is the first to show how E1 activity is controlled by post-translational modifications, and similar regulation likely exists across the homologous E1s of ubiquitin-like modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2056350584,"The kinesin-13 Kif2C hydrolyzes ATP and uses the energy released to disassemble microtubules. The mechanism by which this is achieved remains elusive. Here we show that Kif2C-(sN+M), a monomeric construct consisting of the motor domain with the proximal part of the N-terminal Neck extension but devoid of its more distal, unstructured, and highly basic part, has a robust depolymerase activity. When detached from microtubules, the Kif2C-(sN+M) nucleotide-binding site is occupied by ATP at physiological concentrations of adenine nucleotides. As a consequence, Kif2C-(sN+M) starts its interaction with microtubules in that state, which differentiates kinesin-13s from motile kinesins. Moreover, in this ATP-bound conformational state, Kif2C-(sN+M) has a higher affinity for soluble tubulin compared with microtubules. We propose a mechanism in which, in the first step, the specificity of ATP-bound Kif2C for soluble tubulin causes it to stabilize a curved conformation of tubulin heterodimers at the ends of microtubules. Data from an ATPase-deficient Kif2C mutant suggest that, then, ATP hydrolysis precedes and is required for tubulin release to take place. Finally, comparison with Kif2C-Motor indicates that the binding specificity for curved tubulin and, accordingly, the microtubule depolymerase activity are conferred to the motor domain by its N-terminal Neck extension."

Using as representative a study design as possible, this investigation sought to gain insights into this area. A healthy 25-year-old woman collected her entire urine over a period of 63 days in 12-h intervals (126 measurements) to determine cortisol and neopterin (immune activation marker) levels. In addition, she filled out questionnaires on emotional state and daily routine in 12-h intervals, and was interviewed weekly to identify emotionally negative and positive everyday incidents. Adjusted cross-correlational analyses revealed that stressful incidents were associated with cyclic response patterns in both urinary cortisol and urinary neopterin concentrations. Urinary cortisol levels first decreased 12–24 h after stressful incidents occurred (lag 1: −.178; p = 0.048) and then increased a total of 72–84 h later (lag 6: +.224; p = 0.013). Urinary neopterin levels first increased 0–12 h before the occurrence of stressful incidents (−lag 1: +.185; p = 0.040) and then decreased a total of 48–60 h following such stressors (lag 4: −.181; p = 0.044). Decreases in urinary neopterin levels were also found 24–36 and 48–60 h after increases in pensiveness (lag 2: −.215; p = 0.017) and depressiveness (lag 4: −.221; p = 0.014), respectively. Findings on emotionally positive incidents sharply contrasted with those dealing with negative experiences. Positive incidents were followed first by urinary cortisol concentration increases within 12 h (lag 0: +.290; p = 0.001) and then by decreases after a total of 60–72 h (lag 5: −.186; p = 0.039).

As with previous investigations on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), this study showed that stress system response can be considerably longer and more complex and differentiated than findings from conventional group studies have suggested. Further integrative single-case studies will need to be conducted in order to draw firm conclusions about stress system dynamics under real-life conditions."

ER is the target for anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen (TAM). However, the potential for classical versus nonclassical ER signaling to influence hormone sensitivity is not known. Moreover, anti-estrogens frequently activate several signaling cascades besides the target ER, and the implications of these ""off-target"" signaling events have not been explored. Here, we report that p38γ MAPK is selectively activated by treatment with TAM. This results in both phosphorylation of ER at Ser-118 and stimulation of c-Jun transcription, thus switching ER signaling from the classical to the nonclassical pathway leading to increased hormone sensitivity. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation at Ser-118 is required for ER to bind both p38γ and c-Jun, thereby promoting ER relocation from ERE to AP-1 promoter sites. Thus, ER/Ser-118 phosphorylation serves as a central mechanism by which p38γ regulates signaling transduction of ER with its inhibitor TAM."

Fibronectin not only provides a scaffold for cell anchorage but also harbors a cryptic antiadhesive site capable of inducing β1-integrin inactivation. In this study, this cryptic antiadhesive site is implicated in spontaneous induction of anoikis. Nontransformed fibroblasts (NIH3T3) adhering to a fibronectin substratum underwent anoikis during serum starvation culture. This anoikis was caused by proteolytic exposure of the cryptic antiadhesive site in fibronectin by matrix metalloproteinase. Eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) was identified as a membrane receptor for the exposed antiadhesive site. Serum starvation raised the membrane residence of eEF1A, and siRNA-based disruption of this increase rendered cells anoikis-resistant.

In this study, we investigated the spontaneous induction of anoikis in nontransformed fibroblasts (NIH3T3) adhering to the fibronectin substratum, which occurs during serum starvation culture. Serum starvation culture has been used as an in vitro culture model to mimic the in vivo microenvironment of ischemic tissue and the tumor niche, which is characterized by nutritional starvation and reduced oxygen levels (24Bialik S. Cryns V.L. Drincic A. Miyata S. Wollowick A.L. Srinivasan A. Kitsis R.N. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is activated by serum and glucose deprivation in cardiac myocytes.Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Angiogenesis in cancer and other diseases.Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar). We first showed that apoptosis of NIH3T3 cells is due to spontaneous cell detachment from the fibronectin substratum. Anoikis during serum starvation culture was caused by proteolytic exposure of the cryptic antiadhesive site in fibronectin to which cells adhered. It is surprising that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) was identified as a putative membrane receptor mediating the antiadhesive effect of this exposed site. eEF1A is a key player of the cytoplasm in polypeptide chain elongation during protein translation (26Kinzy T.G.

Moonlighting functions of polypeptide elongation factor 1. From actin bundling to zinc finger protein R1-associated nuclear localization.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although there have been no reports of the membrane localization of eEF1A, our results of immunofluorescence confocal microscopic and flow cytometric analyses and immunoprecipitation studies support the residence of eEF1A on the outer cell surfaces. Membrane residence of eEF1A was increased during serum starvation culture, and disruption of this increase by RNA interference rendered cells resistant to anoikis. Enforced expression also raised membrane residence of eEF1A, which rendered cells more susceptible to serum starvation-induced anoikis. Besides the canonical role as a cytosolic factor in polypeptide chain elongation during protein translation, our results provide evidence of a new function of eEF1A as a membrane receptor for triggering cell detachment from the ECM, which contributes to cell regulation, including anoikis. BB-94 (Matimastat) was purchased from Tocris Bioscience and used at concentrations of 50–100 nm. The MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitor II, (2R)-[(4-biphenylylsulfonyl)amino]-N-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionamide was obtained from Calbiochem. Peptide FNIII14 (TEATITGLEPGTEYTIYVIALC) and its inactive mutant peptide FNIII14mut (TEATITGLEPGTEYTAYVAALC) were purchased from Operon Biotechnology (Tokyo). Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the active conformation of the human (AG89) and mouse (9EG7) integrin β1 subunit were purchased from MBL and BD Biosciences, respectively. 9EG7 was used also for activation of mouse β1-integrins.

Anti-EF1A monoclonal antibody (CBP-KK1) was from Upstate (Millipore). A function-blocking antibody against the antiadhesive site of fibronectin was prepared as follows. Rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide (CLEPGTEYTIYVIALK) containing the active sequence coupled with thyroglobulin. The IgG fraction of rabbit serum was applied to Sepharose beads coupled with the synthetic peptide immunogen. Eluted IgG was used as anti-FNIII14 antibody. Conjugation of peptide FNIII14 with ovalbumin (FNIII14-OVA) was prepared using maleimide-activated ovalbumin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Human fibrosarcoma-like cell line WI38VA and mouse colon cancer cell line Colon26M3.1 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Human eEF1A cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a cDNA library obtained from U937 cells and two primers (5′-CTGCGCGAATTCAAATGGGAAAGGAAAAGACT-3′ and 5′-ATTAGGGCGGCCGCTCATTTAGCCTTCTGAGCTTT-3′). The PCR product digested by EcoRI and NotI was subcloned into EcoRI-NotI-digested pCMV-Myc mammalian expression vector (Clontech). The identity of the inserted cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing with a 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Cells were washed and used at 48 h following transfection using LT-1 transfection reagent (TaKaRa) for NIH3T3 cells or Lipofectamine for WI38VA13 cells. siRNA of eEF1A1 (sense, GGAUGUCUACAAAAUUGGUtt and antisense, ACCAAUUUUGUAGACAUCCtg) (GenBankTM accession no.

The siRNAs were transfected into cells using NIH3T3 transfection reagent (Altogen Biosystems), and the cells were used at 48 h after transfection. The antiadhesive effect of peptide FNIII14 or FNIII14-OVA was evaluated by the inhibitory effects either on cell adhesion to fibronectin (19Kato R. Ishikawa T. Kamiya S. Oguma F. Ueki M. Goto S.

For cell adhesion, cells suspended with the serum-free medium with or without the sample to be tested were seeded onto a 96-well plate coated with fibronectin, incubated for 30–60 min, and then fixed with formalin. After washing off unadhered cells, cells adhered to the fibronectin substratum were counted as described previously (28Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O.

Cell survival during serum starvation culture was determined as described previously (28Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O. Kamiya S. Hayashi R. Kodama H.

Briefly, cells suspended with serum-free medium were seeded onto a 96-well plate coated with fibronectin and cultured in the presence or absence of the sample to be tested for the indicated periods. The number of surviving cells was evaluated on the basis of the WST assay using the cell counting kit (Wako Pure Chemicals, Tokyo). A membrane protein, p50, that has specific binding affinity for peptide FNIII14 was affinity-labeled using biotinylated FNIII14 as described previously (23Miura S. Kamiya S. Saito Y. Wada S. Hayashi R. Taira J. Kodama H. Yajima H. Ueki M. Fukai F. Antiadhesive sites present in the fibronectin type III-like repeats of human plasma fibronectin.Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2007; 30: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with biotinylated FNIII14 in the presence or absence of a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled FNIII14 or an inactive control peptide, FNIII14mut. Biotinylated FNIII14 was prepared by labeling peptide FNIII14 with water-soluble, membrane-impermeable analog of NHS-LS-biotin, EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) (30Baqui M. Botero D. Gereben B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1206-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Binding of biotinylated FNIII14 to p50 was covalently cross-linked with a water-soluble cross-linker, 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide (Pierce). Cell viability after affinity labeling was higher than 90%. p50 was detected by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates using peroxidase-labeled avidin. For the identification of p50 protein, 5 × 109 K562 cells was used for the affinity labeling, and the crude membrane-enriched fraction was prepared (31Nishiumi S. Ashida H. Rapid preparation of a plasma membrane fraction from adipocytes and muscle cells. Application to detection of translocated glucose transporter 4 on the plasma membrane.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 2343-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The lysate of the membrane-enriched fraction was subjected to affinity chromatography using monomeric avidin-immobilized beads (Pierce). p50 bound to the beads was eluted with biotin and separated by SDS-PAGE. In-gel tryptic digestion, MALDI-TOF-MS, and protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting were performed as described previously (32Sabarth N. Lamer S. Zimny-Arndt U. Jungblut P.R. Meyer T.F. Bumann D. Identification of surface proteins of Helicobacter pylori by selective biotinylation, affinity purification, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.J. Biol.

Live cells were incubated without permeabilization with anti-eEF1A IgG (Upstate) (5 μg/ml) in PBS(-) containing 1% BSA at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing off the primary antibody, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with PBS(-), and then blocked with 5% BSA-containing PBS(-). The primary antibody was labeled with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:2000 with PBS(-) containing 1% BSA for 60 min. Alternatively, immunofluorescence staining was performed after fixation with paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. In either case, cells were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fluoview FV1000, Olympus). The images acquired were processed with FV10-ASW software (Olympus). Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan cytometer (FACS Aria) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cell suspension was incubated with anti-eEF1A IgG (2 μg/ml) (Upstate) or anti-β1 integrin 9EG7, followed by FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG. In the analyses, propidium iodide-positive cells were excluded in our final flow cytometry analysis to avoid inaccuracies caused by dead or decaying cells. Subconfluent cells were incubated with cell membrane-impermeable EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) (30Baqui M. Botero D. Gereben B. Curcio C. Harney J.W. Salvatore D. Sorimachi K. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Human type 3 iodothyronine selenodeiodinase is located in the plasma membrane and undergoes rapid internalization to endosomes.J. Biol.

After washing, cell lysates were incubated with anti-biotin goat IgG, immunoprecipitated using protein G beads, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-EF1A monoclonal antibody and peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG. cDNAs encoding full-length human eEF1A was amplified by PCR with a specific primer set as follows. Sense, 5′-AAGGATCCATGGGAAAGGAAAAGACTCATATCAACAT-3′ and antisense, 5′-GAGAATTCTCATTTAGCCTTCTGAGCTTTCTGGG-3′. PCR products were sequenced and inserted into pGEX-2TK using the BamHI and EcoRI sites within the primer domain. Escherichia coli Rosetta-competent cells were transformed with pGEX-2TK containing human eEF1A1 DNA, and protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were then collected and lysed by sonication in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and proteinase inhibitors. GST-tagged human eEF1A was trapped from the soluble fraction using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), and then trapped protein was eluted by 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm glutathione (reduced form). The binding of peptide FNIII14 to GST-eEF1A fusion protein was confirmed by ELISA. In brief, anti-GST monoclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml) was coated onto an ELISA plate, and the plate was blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2% BSA (blocking buffer). The wells were incubated with GST-eEF1A (500 nm) in blocking buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing four times with blocking buffer, the wells were then incubated with the increasing concentrations of biotinylated FNIII14 or biotinylated FNIII14mut at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence or absence of unlabeled FNIII14 (10-fold molar excess of biotinylated FNIII14). After extensive washing, the amount of biotinylated FNIII14 bound to eEF1A was measured at 450 nm using streptavidin-peroxidase and o-phenylenediamine. Unpaired Student's t tests were used for statistical evaluation. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. NIH3T3 cells adhere to the fibronectin substratum mainly via integrin α5β1 (28Saito Y. Imazeki H. Miura S. Yoshimura T. Okutsu H. Harada Y. Ohwaki T. Nagao O. Kamiya S. Hayashi R. Kodama H. Handa H. Yoshida T. Fukai F. A peptide derived from tenascin-C induces β1 integrin activation through syndecan-4.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34929-34937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When NIH3T3 cells adhering to the fibronectin were cultured under serum-starved conditions, the number of viable cells decreased in a time-dependent manner, which was in parallel with an increase in the detached cell number (Fig. 1A). This decrease in the viable cell number was accompanied by an increase in DNA fragmentation, which was blocked by addition of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD fmk (Fig. 1, A and B). NIH3T3 cells became resistant to apoptosis depending on the coating concentration of fibronectin (Fig. 1C). Moreover, serum starvation-induced apoptosis was reduced by treatment with an anti-β1 integrin antibody, 9EG7, that is able to activate β1-integrins (29Bazzoni G. Shih D.T. Buck C.A. Hemler M.E. Monoclonal antibody 9EG7 defines a novel β 1 integrin epitope induced by soluble ligand and manganese, but inhibited by calcium.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the decrease in cell viability was accelerated by the RGD-containing peptide, an antagonist for integrin α5β1 (Fig. 1A). Thus, apoptosis of NIH3T3 cells adhering to the fibronectin substratum was shown to be anoikis. Peptide FNIII14 added in solution, which was capable of interfering with NIH3T3 cell adhesion to the fibronectin by inactivating β1-integrins (supplemental Fig. S1), accelerated anoikis in NIH3T3 cells adhering to the fibronectin substratum (Fig. 2A). Of note, peptide FNIII14 also accelerated anoikis when coated on the culture plate in combination with fibronectin (Fig. 2A). The peptide FNIII14 coated over the fibronectin substrate would mimic the exposed antiadhesive site in the fibronectin substratum to which cells adhere. Therefore, the results led to speculate that anoikis of NIH3T3 cells might be triggered by exposure of the cryptic antiadhesive site within the fibronectin molecule. To verify this, we prepared an antibody capable of blocking the antiadhesive effect of peptide FNIII14. A polyclonal antibody (α-FNIII14, see “Materials and Methods”) able to abrogate the antiadhesive effects of peptide FNIII14 was obtained (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Of importance, this function-blocking antibody was also capable of reducing anoikis of NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2B). Preimmune control IgG and another antibody recognizing the heparin-binding domain II of fibronectin, which is located near the peptide FNIII14 region, had no effect (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, either a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor (BB-94) or a specific inhibitor of MMP-2 and MMP-9 ((2R)-[(4-biphenylylsulfonyl)amino]-N-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionamide) also reduced anoikis of NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2C). Supporting this result is the fact that gelatinolytic activity was detected in the culture medium at around 68 and 62 kDa (Fig. 2D), which corresponds to the molecular weight of the proform and active form of MMP-2, respectively. In fact, degradation of fibronectin molecules coated as the adhesion substratum was observed during the culture of NIH3T3 cells, in which the fibronectin molecule was degraded in a time-dependent manner, concomitant with increases in fibronectin fragments containing the epitope of the anti-FNIII14 antibody (supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggest that proteolytic exposure of the cryptic antiadhesive site in fibronectin was responsible for anoikis. We previously detected a membrane protein of around 50 kDa (p50) that specifically binds to peptide FNIII14 with the exposed antiadhesive site (21Kamiya S. Kato R. Wakabayashi M. Tohyama T. Enami I.

https://openalex.org/W2140260255,"To initiate HIV entry, the HIV envelope protein gp120 must engage its primary receptor CD4 and a coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4. In the absence of a high resolution structure of a gp120-coreceptor complex, biochemical studies of CCR5 have revealed the importance of its N terminus and second extracellular loop (ECL2) in binding gp120 and mediating viral entry. Using a panel of synthetic CCR5 ECL2-derived peptides, we show that the C-terminal portion of ECL2 (2C, comprising amino acids Cys-178 to Lys-191) inhibit HIV-1 entry of both CCR5- and CXCR4-using isolates at low micromolar concentrations. In functional viral assays, these peptides inhibited HIV-1 entry in a CD4-independent manner. Neutralization assays designed to measure the effects of CCR5 ECL2 peptides when combined with either with the small molecule CD4 mimetic NBD-556, soluble CD4, or the CCR5 N terminus showed additive inhibition for each, indicating that ECL2 binds gp120 at a site distinct from that of N terminus and acts independently of CD4. Using saturation transfer difference NMR, we determined the region of CCR5 ECL2 used for binding gp120, showed that it can bind to gp120 from both R5 and X4 isolates, and demonstrated that the peptide interacts with a CD4-gp120 complex in a similar manner as to gp120 alone. As the CCR5 N terminus-gp120 interactions are dependent on CD4 activation, our data suggest that gp120 has separate binding sites for the CCR5 N terminus and ECL2, the ECL2 binding site is present prior to CD4 engagement, and it is conserved across CCR5- and CXCR4-using strains. These peptides may serve as a starting point for the design of inhibitors with broad spectrum anti-HIV activity."
https://openalex.org/W2005731536,"ABCA7, a close relative of ABCA1 which facilitates cholesterol efflux to lipid-poor apoproteins, has been implicated in macrophage lipid efflux and clearance of apoptotic cells in in vitro studies. In the current study, we investigated the in vivo effects of macrophage ABCA7 deficiency on lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. Chimeras with dysfunctional ABCA7 in macrophages and other blood cells were generated by transplantation of bone marrow from ABCA7 knockout (KO) mice into irradiated low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) KO mice. Unexpectedly, macrophage ABCA7 deficiency did not significantly affect atherosclerosis susceptibility of LDLr KO mice after 10 weeks Western-type diet feeding. However, ABCA7 deficiency was associated with 2-fold (p<0.05) higher macrophage ABCA1 mRNA expression levels. Combined disruption of ABCA1 and ABCA7 in bone-marrow-derived cells increased atherosclerotic lesion development (1.5-fold (p>0.05) as compared to wild type transplanted mice. However, single deletion of ABCA1 had a similar effect (1.8-fold, p<0.05). Macrophage foam cell accumulation in the peritoneal cavity was reduced in ABCA1/ABCA7 dKO transplanted animals as compared to single ABCA1 KO transplanted mice, which was associated with increased ABCG1 expression. Interestingly, spleens of ABCA1/ABCA7 double KO transplanted mice were significantly larger as compared to the other 3 groups and showed massive macrophage lipid accumulation, a reduction in CD3+ T-cells, and increased expression of key regulators of erythropoiesis. In conclusion, deletion of ABCA7 in bone marrow-derived cells does not affect atherogenesis in the arterial wall neither in the absence or presence of ABCA1. Interestingly, combined deletion of bone marrow ABCA1 and ABCA7 causes severe splenomegaly associated with cellular lipid accumulation, a reduction in splenic CD3+ T cells, and induced markers of erythropoeisis. Our data indicate that ABCA7 may play a role in T cell proliferation and erythropoeisis in spleen."
https://openalex.org/W2150534868,"Ischemic injuries permanently affect kidney tissue and challenge cell viability, promoting inflammation and fibrogenesis. Ischemia results in nutrient deprivation, which triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, ultimately resulting in the unfolded protein response (UPR). The aim of this study was to test whether the UPR could promote an angiogenic response independently of the HIF-1α pathway during ischemic stress in the human kidney epithelium. Glucose deprivation induced the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and angiogenin (ANG) in human kidney epithelial cells independently of HIF-1α. Glucose deprivation, but not hypoxia, triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress and activated the UPR. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of the gene encoding the kinase PERK decreased VEGFA and bFGF expression, but neither gene was affected by the inhibition of IRE1α or ATF6. Furthermore, we show that the expression of angiogenin, which inhibits protein synthesis, is regulated by both IRE1α and PERK, which could constitute a complementary function of the UPR in the repression of translation. In a rat model of acute ischemic stress, we show that the UPR is activated in parallel with VEGFA, bFGF, and ANG expression and independently of HIF-1α. Ischemic injuries permanently affect kidney tissue and challenge cell viability, promoting inflammation and fibrogenesis. Ischemia results in nutrient deprivation, which triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, ultimately resulting in the unfolded protein response (UPR). The aim of this study was to test whether the UPR could promote an angiogenic response independently of the HIF-1α pathway during ischemic stress in the human kidney epithelium. Glucose deprivation induced the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and angiogenin (ANG) in human kidney epithelial cells independently of HIF-1α. Glucose deprivation, but not hypoxia, triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress and activated the UPR. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of the gene encoding the kinase PERK decreased VEGFA and bFGF expression, but neither gene was affected by the inhibition of IRE1α or ATF6. Furthermore, we show that the expression of angiogenin, which inhibits protein synthesis, is regulated by both IRE1α and PERK, which could constitute a complementary function of the UPR in the repression of translation.

In particular, it is still unresolved whether hydrolysis leads to dissociation of the ATP-induced dimers or opening of the dimers, with the NBDs remaining in contact during the hydrolysis cycle. We studied a prototypical ABC NBD, the Methanococcus jannaschii MJ0796, using spectroscopic techniques. We show that fluorescence from a tryptophan positioned at the dimer interface and luminescence resonance energy transfer between probes reacted with single-cysteine mutants can be used to follow NBD association/dissociation in real time. The intermonomer distances calculated from luminescence resonance energy transfer data indicate that the NBDs separate completely following ATP hydrolysis, instead of opening. The results support ABC protein NBD association/dissociation, as opposed to constant-contact models.

These models can be broadly divided into the following. 1) In monomer/dimer models, where ATP hydrolysis is followed by dissociation of the dimers, and the energy that drives the conformational changes that lead to substrate transport (power stroke) is provided by the dimer association-dissociation. 2) Constant-contact models, where the NBDs remain in contact during the hydrolysis cycle, and the power stroke results from smaller conformational changes at the NBD-dimer interface.

Our results support hydrolysis models that include separation of NBD dimers into monomers during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Three mutants of the M. jannaschii MJ0796 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified: 1) Cys-less-MJ0796-G174W (MJ-CL, in which 3The following mutant designations were used throughout this study: MJ-CL, Cys-less, single-Trp MJ0796 mutant (MJ0796-C53G-C128I-G174W); MJ-C14, single-Cys mutant (G14C) on the MJ-CL background; and MJI-C14, catalytically deficient mutant (E171Q) on the MJ-C14 background. Cys-53 and Cys-128 were replaced with Gly and Ile, respectively, which are the residues in the equivalent positions of the M. jannaschii MJ1267 NBD, and Gly-174 was replaced with Trp); 2) single-Cys MJ0796-G174W-G14C (MJ-C14); and 3) single-Cys MJ0796-G174W-E171Q-G14C (MJI-C14). MJ-CL DNA was synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ), and the other mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. DNAs were cloned into pET19b (EMD Biosciences, Rockland, MA) for expression in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RILP (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Induction was with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Proteins were purified as described (16Zoghbi M.E. Fuson K.L. Sutton R.B. Altenberg G.A. Kinetics of the association/dissociation cycle of an ATP-binding cassette nucleotide-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 4157-4164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), with all procedures carried out at 4 °C. Basically, cells were disrupted in 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT, and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6 (lysis buffer), with 1 mm PMSF. The lysate was centrifuged for 15 min at 30,000 × g, and the supernatant was diluted 2-fold with NaCl-free buffer (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.6), filtered, and loaded into a Mono Q anion-exchange column (HiPrepQ FF16, GE Healthcare). Elution was accomplished with a linear 0–1 m [NaCl] gradient. The highly purified protein can be used for biochemical and biophysical studies, but a homogeneous monodisperse pure sample can be obtained after additional purification by gel filtration using a Superdex HR200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, see supplemental Methods). Purified proteins were stored at −80 °C. Changes in Trp fluorescence (1–2 μm protein in 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6) were determined at 20 °C, with excitation at 295 nm. Depending on the experiment, we recorded emission spectra between 310 and 400 nm or emission at 345 nm (Hitachi F-7000 spectrofluorometer, Tokyo, Japan). Single-Cys mutants MJ-C14 and MJI-C14 in 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, were labeled with the thiol-reactive Tb3+ chelate DTPA-cs124-EMPH (17Chen J. Selvin P.R. Thiol-reactive luminescent chelates of terbium and europium.Bioconjug. Chem. 1999; 10: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), fluorescein maleimide (Invitrogen), or Cy3 maleimide (GE Healthcare), at a 2-to-1 molar excess. DTPA-cs124-EMPH contains carbostyril 124 (7-amino-4-methyl-2(1H)-quinolinone) as an “antenna” that absorbs at 335 nm, the chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) that binds Tb3+ tightly and shields it from the quenching effects of water, and the thiol-selective maleimide group for protein labeling. MJ-CL was used as control to determine nonspecific labeling. NBDs were labeled with donor or with acceptor for 2 h at room temperature, and unreacted probes were removed by gel filtration (Zeba columns, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For some LRET studies, the labeled monomers were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200HR column. For the basic protocol, we split the single-Cys monomers and labeled one-half with donor (Tb3+-chelate maleimide) and the other half with acceptor (fluorescein maleimide or Cy3 maleimide). Donor-labeled and acceptor-labeled NBDs were mixed at a one-to-one molar ratio prior to LRET experiments, and the proximity between the donor- and acceptor-labeled monomers was determined under different conditions. Emission was measured on either a Photon Technology International spectrometer (QM3SS, Photon Technology International, Inc., London, Ontario, Canada) or an Optical Building Blocks phosphorescence lifetime photometer (EasyLife L, Optical Building Blocks Corp., Birmingham, NJ). The emission was recorded with a 200-μs delay from the beginning of the ∼1-μs excitation pulse from a xenon flash lamp (gated mode). During those 200 μs, the short lifetime processes such as acceptor emission resulting from direct excitation, scattering of the excitation pulse, and autofluorescence decay significantly. Therefore, in gated mode, the remaining light arises from long lifetime processes such as emission from the donor or sensitized emission from the acceptor. Excitation was set to 335 nm with a monochromator in the Photon Technology International system or by the use of a narrow band 335-nm filter (Semrock FF01-335/7, Rochester, NY) in the Optical Building Blocks system. Emission spectra were recorded with the Photon Technology International system. For intensity measurements, we used band-pass filters (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) appropriate to collect light from Tb3+ (490/10 nm), fluorescein (520/10 nm) or Cy3 (570/10). Generally, donor and acceptor emission decays were collected as averages from 1,800 pulses at 100 Hz. As expected, donor emission and sensitized acceptor emission were not polarized (supplemental Fig. 5). Distances between the donor and acceptor probes were calculated according toE=1−τDA/τD(Eq. 1) R=R0E−1−11/6(Eq. 2) where E is the efficiency of energy transfer, R0 is the Förster distance (the distance at which E = 0.5), and τD and τDA are the lifetimes of the donor in the absence and presence of the acceptor, respectively. In LRET, the lifetime of the donor molecules that participate in energy transfer, τDA, is equal to the sensitized emission lifetime, i.e. the long lifetime of the acceptor that arises exclusively from energy transfer (18Selvin P.R. Principles and biophysical applications of lanthanide-based probes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The donor-only decay (τD) was well fitted by a two-exponential decay function, where the fast component (τ = 664 ± 64 μs, n = 10) contributed only 5 ± 1% to the signal. Therefore, only the slower lifetime (τ = 2,088 ± 7 μs) was used for the distance calculations, but using a weighted average of the lifetimes yielded calculated distances that differed from the values reported under “Results” by <1 Å. For the determination of the donor-acceptor lifetimes (τDA), we first eliminated the contribution of the ATP-insensitive components by subtracting the decays in ATP and Mg-ATP from the decay in the absence of ATP (decays from the same sample in different conditions: no ATP, after the addition of ATP, and after the subsequent addition of Mg2+). This maneuver allowed us to fit the sensitized emission decays to a single exponential function (after 800 μs for the Tb3+/fluorescein pair or after 500 μs for the Tb3+/Cy3 pair), which simplified the analysis and interpretation of the data because the lifetime can be ascribed to a single donor-acceptor distance. Additional details on the analysis of LRET data are presented under the supplemental Methods. Data are shown as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed by the Student's t test for paired or unpaired data, as appropriate. p < 0.05 in a two-tailed analysis was considered significant. The number of experiments, n, corresponds to independent measurements from at least three different protein preparations. The goodness of fit for the analysis of LRET decays was determined from the random residual distribution, which showed no structure and χ-square values near unity. We engineered single-Cys mutants (Gly-14 to Cys), starting with a Cys-less background (MJ-CL). One of the mutants (MJ-C14) is catalytically active, whereas the other mutant (MJI-C14) is inactive (E171Q substitution). The Glu-171 to Gln mutation essentially abolishes ATP hydrolysis and stabilizes ATP-induced dimerization (4Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F.

The single-Cys mutants also have an introduced Trp at position 174, which has been shown to be a good dimerization probe (16Zoghbi M.E. Fuson K.L. Sutton R.B. Altenberg G.A.

In most experiments, we used the Tb3+/fluorescein LRET donor-acceptor pair because its R0 of 46.2 Å is close to the estimated Cys-14-Cys-14 distance in the dimer structure (50 Å). We also performed experiments using the Tb3+/Cy3 pair (R0 = 61.2 Å). Single-Cys mutants were well labeled with the LRET probes (as shown in SDS-PAGE gels on a UV transilluminator), and analysis of the NBD oligomeric state by size-exclusion chromatography indicated that the single-Cys mutants are able to dimerize in the presence of ATP even after labeling with the LRET probes (supplemental Fig. 1). The behavior of MJ-C14 and MJI-C14 in size-exclusion chromatography is indistinguishable from that of the corresponding MJ and MJI proteins (16Zoghbi M.E. Fuson K.L. Sutton R.B. Altenberg G.A. Kinetics of the association/dissociation cycle of an ATP-binding cassette nucleotide-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 4157-4164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The emission spectra from labeled NBDs in 2 mm ATP are shown in Fig. 1B. The Tb3+-labeled NBD spectrum (black trace, Tb only) shows sharp peaks with interposed dark regions, typical of the emission of this lanthanide. The fluorescein-labeled NBDs (blue trace, F only) showed basically no emission, demonstrating that gating of the emission recording effectively removes nanosecond-lifetime processes such as direct excitation of the acceptor. When Tb3+-labeled and fluorescein-labeled NBDs were mixed, the emission spectrum (red trace, Tb/F) showed the typical Tb3+ peaks plus an emission that peaked at 520 nm corresponding to the sensitized emission of fluorescein (see inset for a zoomed view), i.e. fluorescein emission resulting from its excitation by energy transfer from Tb3+. The emission spectrum for the similarly Tb3+/fluorescein-labeled MJ-CL (green trace, MJ-CL Tb/F) showed small peaks corresponding to Tb3+ emission from basal unspecific labeling and/or unbound Tb3+ remaining after gel filtration, but sensitized fluorescein emission was undetectable. Therefore, the fluorescein signal measured in MJ-C14 and MJI-C14 arises from energy transfer between the probes bound to Cys-14. ATP had no significant effect on the emission of MJ-CL, Tb3+-only, or acceptor-only NBDs. Equivalent results were obtained for the Tb3+/Cy3 LRET pair, where a clear Cy3 sensitized emission peak at 565 nm can be observed (supplemental Fig. 2). The dependence of the fluorescein sensitized emission on ATP concentration is shown in Fig. 1C. Mixed Tb3+- and fluorescein-labeled MJ-C14 in the absence of ATP showed a small emission that gradually increased as the NBDs were exposed to increasing ATP levels. This ATP-dependent increase in sensitized emission originates from the association between Tb3+-labeled and fluorescein-labeled monomers that, after binding ATP, become close enough (dimerize) to allow energy transfer between the donor and acceptor. If random association between monomers occurs after the addition of ATP, the sensitized emission originates from a representative sample of the dimers; those formed by a Tb3+ monomer and a fluorescein monomer. Because the recorded acceptor emission with long lifetime can only arise from energy transfer, the stoichiometry of labeling affects the intensity of the signal, but not the distance calculations or the Kd determinations, which depend on relative changes and probe lifetimes, respectively (18Selvin P.R. Principles and biophysical applications of lanthanide-based probes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 19Bao X. Lee S.C. Reuss L. Altenberg G.A. Change in permeant size selectivity by phosphorylation of connexin 43 gap-junctional hemichannels by PKC.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, basically all NBDs are in monomeric form (supplemental Fig. 1); thus, the small fluorescein signal observed before the addition of ATP is mostly due to scattering of the excitation pulse (artifact that depends on the instrument response time) and to the presence of a small fraction of aggregates (see supplemental Methods). From the ATP-dependent increment in the sensitized fluorescein emission, we calculated the apparent affinity constants for ATP of MJ-C14 (Kd = 47 ± 3 μm, n = 5) and MJI-C14 (Kd = 5.0 ± 0.2 μm, n = 5), with Hill coefficients of 1.6 ± 0.1 and 1.4 ± 0.1, respectively (Fig. 1D). The ∼10-fold increased affinity for ATP of MJI-C14 has been previously reported for other E171Q mutants (15Moody J.E. Millen L. Binns D. Hunt J.F. Thomas P.J.

Kinetics of the association/dissociation cycle of an ATP-binding cassette nucleotide-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 4157-4164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The apparent affinities for ATP and Hill coefficients determined by Trp fluorescence quenching in MJ-C14 and MJI-C14 were close to the values determined by LRET (supplemental Fig. 3) and to those previously found for the corresponding active and inactive proteins with the native Cys residues (16Zoghbi M.E. Fuson K.L. Sutton R.B. Altenberg G.A. Kinetics of the association/dissociation cycle of an ATP-binding cassette nucleotide-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 4157-4164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This indicates that removal of the two native Cys residues and introduction of a single-Cys mutation at position 14 does not result in significant alterations in ATP binding and dimerization. In addition, the similarity between the ATP-induced responses of LRET and Trp-174 fluorescence supports the notion that these two independent techniques can be used to monitor NBD dimerization. The time courses of the changes in fluorescein sensitized emission and Trp-174 fluorescence in response to a saturating concentration of ATP are shown in Fig. 2, A (MJ-C14) and B (MJI-C14). The changes in sensitized emission (red trace) and Trp fluorescence (black trace) followed the same time course, but had opposite direction; dimerization causes Trp fluorescence quenching by Trp-174-Trp-174 π stacking (16Zoghbi M.E. Fuson K.L. Sutton R.B. Altenberg G.A. Kinetics of the association/dissociation cycle of an ATP-binding cassette nucleotide-binding domain.J. Biol.

Dimerization of MJ-C14 and MJI-C14 proceeded slowly, requiring several minutes for completion. The dimerization of MJ-C14 induced by Na-ATP was ∼3-fold slower than the corresponding MJI-C14 dimerization (Fig. 2B versus Fig. 2A, see supplemental Table 1). We have previously found that the slow rate of NBD dimerization induced by Na-ATP is not due to mixing artifacts or limiting NBD concentration (16Zoghbi M.E. Fuson K.L. Sutton R.B. Altenberg G.A.

Kinetics of the association/dissociation cycle of an ATP-binding cassette nucleotide-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 4157-4164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we found a dramatic increase in the dimerization rate of MJ-C14 by Mg-ATP versus Na-ATP, an effect absent in MJI-C14 (see supplemental Table 1). The similarity of these observations with the responses of active and inactive MJ0796 (16Zoghbi M.E. Fuson K.L. Sutton R.B. Altenberg G.A. Kinetics of the association/dissociation cycle of an ATP-binding cassette nucleotide-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 4157-4164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggests that the single-Cys mutants behavior is essentially identical to that of the NBDs containing the native Cys. The reason for the faster Mg-ATP- versus Na-ATP-induced dimerization of catalytically active MJ0796 has not been established, but Mg2+ coordination at the active site and electrostatics at the dimer interface could play a role (4Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. ATP binding to the motor domain from an ABC transporter drives formation of a nucleotide sandwich dimer.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In many NTPases, including ABC NBDs, the conserved acidic residue at the end of the Walker B motif (Glu-171 in MJ0796) makes a water-mediated contact with Mg2+, required for high affinity nucleotide binding (20Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Classification and evolution of P-loop GTPases and related ATPases.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 21Sprang S.R. G protein mechanisms: insights from structural analysis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). The nucleotide-bound dimer interface has a relatively intense concentration of negative charge, and Mg2+ coordination could facilitate ATP binding and NBD association. If electrostatics at the dimer interface are important for dimerization, it is possible that the absence of the Glu negative charge in the E171Q mutant facilitates Na-ATP-induced dimerization and accounts for the faster MJI-C14 dimerization by Na-ATP. Fig. 2A also shows that after the addition of Mg2+ to MJ-C14, there was a fast decrease of fluorescein sensitized emission and increase of Trp fluorescence (see also supplemental Table 1). The LRET signal and Trp emission reached a stable value approximately halfway between the 100% m"

The E2F6 repressor is a unique E2F member that acts independently of pocket proteins. Forced expression of E2F6 in mouse myocardium induced heart failure and mortality, with severity of symptoms correlating to E2F6 levels. Echocardiography demonstrated a 37% increase (P>0.05) in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and reduced ejection fraction (<40%, P>0.05) in young transgenic (Tg) mice. Microarray and qPCR analysis revealed a paradoxical increase in E2F-responsive genes, which regulate the cell cycle, without changes in cardiomyocyte cell number or size in Tg mice. Young adult Tg mice displayed a 75% (P>0.01) decrease in gap junction protein connexin-43, resulting in abnormal electrocardiogram including a 24% (P>0.05) increase in PR interval. Further, mir-206, which targets connexin-43, was up-regulated 10-fold (P>0.05) in Tg myocardium. The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which regulates the levels of miR-206 and connexin-43, was activated in Tg hearts. Thus, deregulated E2F6 levels evoked abnormal gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, leading to cardiac remodeling and dilated cardiomyopathy. The data highlight an unprecedented role for the strict regulation of the E2F pathway in normal postnatal cardiac function.—Westendorp, B., Major, J. L., Nader, M., Salih, M., Leenen, F. H.

https://openalex.org/W1989123869,"Under conditions of reduced mitogen or nutritional substrate levels, the serine/threonine kinase target of rapamycin can augment the nuclear content of distinct transcription factors and promote the induction of stress response genes. In its latent (i.e., unphosphorylated) form, the transcription factor STAT1 regulates a subset of genes involved in immune modulation and apoptosis. Based on previous work indicating a functional relationship between mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the nuclear content of latent STAT1, we investigated the mechanism by which mTOR controls STAT1 nuclear import. By fluorescence confocal microscopy, inactivation of mTOR with rapamycin promoted the nuclear translocation of unphosphorylated STAT1, but not that of a STAT1 mutant incapable of binding its nuclear import adaptor karyopherin-α1 (KPNA1). By immunoprecipitation, KPNA1 was physically associated with mTOR and STAT1 in a complex that translocated to the nucleus in response to rapamycin. Although mTOR is not a kinase for KPNA1, the mTOR-associated phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A catalytic interacted directly with KPNA1 and regulated nuclear import of the mTOR-KPNA1 complex. KPNA1, or its interaction with STAT1, was required for the nuclear import of latent STAT1, transcriptional induction of the STAT1 gene, and caspase-3 activation under conditions of reduced mTOR activity (i.e. rapamycin, glucose starvation, serum withdrawal). Therefore, at low mitogen or nutrient levels, mTOR and protein phosphatase 2A catalytically control the constitutive nuclear import of latent STAT1 by KPNA1, which are key modulators of STAT1 expression and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1989075274,"Viral immune invasion proteins are highly effective probes for studying physiological pathways. We report here the characterization of a new viral ubiquitin ligase pK3 expressed by rodent herpesvirus Peru (RHVP) that establishes acute and latent infection in laboratory mice. Our findings show that pK3 binds directly and specifically to class I major histocompatibility proteins (MHCI) in a transmembrane-dependent manner. This binding results in the rapid degradation of the pK3/MHCI complex by a mechanism dependent upon catalytically active pK3. Subsequently, the rapid degradation of pK3/MHCI secondarily causes the slow degradation of membrane bound components of the MHCI peptide loading complex, tapasin, and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Interestingly, this secondary event occurs by cellular endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Cumulatively, our findings show pK3 uses a unique mechanism of substrate detection and degradation compared with other viral or cellular E3 ligases. More importantly, our findings reveal that in the absence of nascent MHCI proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, the transmembrane proteins TAP and tapasin that facilitate peptide binding to MHCI proteins are degraded by cellular quality control mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1988386518,"Motivation It has been proposed that clustering clinical markers, such as blood test results, can be used to stratify patients. However, the robustness of clusters formed with this approach to data pre-processing and clustering algorithm choices has not been evaluated, nor has clustering reproducibility. Here, we made use of the NHANES survey to compare clusters generated with various combinations of pre-processing and clustering algorithms, and tested their reproducibility in two separate samples. Method Values of 44 biomarkers and 19 health/life style traits were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The 1999–2002 survey was used for training, while data from the 2003–2006 survey was tested as a validation set. Twelve combinations of pre-processing and clustering algorithms were applied to the training set. The quality of the resulting clusters was evaluated both by considering their properties and by comparative enrichment analysis. Cluster assignments were projected to the validation set (using an artificial neural network) and enrichment in health/life style traits in the resulting clusters was compared to the clusters generated from the original training set. Results The clusters obtained with different pre-processing and clustering combinations differed both in terms of cluster quality measures and in terms of reproducibility of enrichment with health/life style properties. Z-score normalization, for example, dramatically improved cluster quality and enrichments, as compared to unprocessed data, regardless of the clustering algorithm used. Clustering diabetes patients revealed a group of patients enriched with retinopathies. This could indicate that routine laboratory tests can be used to detect patients suffering from complications of diabetes, although other explanations for this observation should also be considered. Conclusions Clustering according to classical clinical biomarkers is a robust process, which may help in patient stratification. However, optimization of the pre-processing and clustering process may be still required."
