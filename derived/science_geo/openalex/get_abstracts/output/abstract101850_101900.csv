https://openalex.org/W2044057392,"p21CIP1/WAF1 is a CDK inhibitor regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 and is hypothesized to mediate G1 arrest. p53 has been suggested to derive anti-oncogenic properties from this relationship. To test these notions, we created mice lacking p21CIP1/WAF1. They develop normally and (unlike p53-/- mice) have not developed spontaneous malignancies during 7 months of observation. Nonetheless, p21-/- embryonic fibroblasts are significantly deficient in their ability to arrest in G1 in response to DNA damage and nucleotide pool perturbation. p21-/- cells also exhibit a significant growth alteration in vitro, achieving a saturation density as high as that observed in p53-/- cells. In contrast, other aspects of p53 function, such as thymocytic apoptosis and the mitotic spindle checkpoint, appear normal. These results establish the role of p21CIP1/WAF1 in the G1 checkpoint, but suggest that the anti-apoptotic and the anti-oncogenic effects of p53 are more complex."
https://openalex.org/W2038970416,"A method of gene targeting that allows the inducible inactivation of a target gene in mice is presented. The method uses an interferon-responsive promoter to control the expression of Cre recombinase. Here, Cre was used to delete a segment of the DNA polymerase beta gene flanked by IoxP recombinase recognition sites. Deletion was complete in liver and nearly complete in lymphocytes within a few days, whereas partial deletion was obtained in other tissues. This method can be used for the inducible inactivation of any other gene in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2058705034,"Mice lacking cyclin D1 have been generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. Cyclin D1-deficient animals develop to term but show reduced body size, reduced viability, and symptoms of neurological impairment. Their retinas display a striking reduction in cell number due to proliferative failure during embryonic development. In situ hybridization studies of normal mouse embryos revealed an extremely high level of cyclin D1 in the retina, suggesting a special dependence of this tissue on cyclin D1. In adult mutant females, the breast epithelial compartment fails to undergo the massive proliferative changes associated with pregnancy despite normal levels of ovarian steroid hormones. Thus, steroid-induced proliferation of mammary epithelium during pregnancy may be driven through cyclin D1."

https://openalex.org/W2021515035,"Neurons in the mammalian central nervous system are generated from progenitor cells near the lumen of the neural tube. Time-lapse microscopy of dividing cells in slices of developing cerebral cortex reveals that cleavage orientation predicts the fates of daughter cells. Vertical cleavages produce behaviorally and morphologically identical daughters that resemble precursor cells; these symmetric divisions may serve to expand or maintain the progenitor pool. In contrast, horizontally dividing cells produce basal daughters that behave like young migratory neurons and apical daughters that remain within the proliferative zone. Notch1 immunoreactivity is distributed asymmetrically in mitotic cells, with Notch1 inherited selectively by the basal (neuronal) daughter of horizontal divisions. These results provide cellular and molecular evidence that cortical neurons are generated from asymmetric divisions."

A low-barrier hydrogen bond between N delta 1 of His57 and the beta-carboxyl group of Asp102 in chymotrypsin can facilitate the formation of the tetrahedral adduct, and the nuclear magnetic resonance properties of this proton indicate that it is a low-barrier hydrogen bond. These conclusions are supported by the chemical shift of this proton, the deuterium isotope effect on the chemical shift, and the properties of hydrogen-bonded model compounds in organic solvents, including the hydrogen bond in cis-urocanic acid, in which the imidazole ring is internally hydrogen-bonded to the carboxyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1969563780,"Cells respond to diverse external stimuli by polymerizing cytoplasmic actin, and recent evidence indicates that GTPases can specify where this polymerization takes place. Actin assembly in stimulated blood platelets occurs where sequestered monomers add onto the fast-growing (barbed) ends of actin filaments (F-actin), which are capped in the resting cells. We report that D3 and D4 polyphosphoinositides, Pl(4)P, Pl(4,5)P2, Pl(3,4)P2, and Pl(3,4,5)P3, uncap F-actin in resting permeabilized platelets. The thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP), GTP, and GTP gamma S, but not GDP beta S, also uncap F-actin in permeabilized platelets. GDP beta S inhibits TRAP-induced F-actin uncapping, and Pl(4,5)P2 overcomes this inhibition. Constitutively active mutant Rac, but not Rho, activates uncapping of F-actin. Pl(4,5)P2-binding peptides derived from gelsolin inhibit F-actin uncapping by TRAP, Rac, and GTP gamma S. TRAP and Rac induce rapid Pl(4,5)P2 synthesis in permeabilized platelets. The findings establish a signaling pathway for actin assembly involving Rac in which the final message is phosphoinositide-mediated F-actin uncapping."
https://openalex.org/W1988935612,"Germ-line mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) predispose individuals to a variety of human tumors, and somatic mutations of this gene have been identified in sporadic renal cell carcinomas and cerebellar hemangioblastomas. Two transcriptional elongation factors, Elongin B and C, were shown to bind in vitro and in vivo to a short, colinear region of the VHL protein (pVHL) that is frequently mutated in human tumors. A peptide replica of this region inhibited binding of pVHL to Elongin B and C whereas a point-mutant derivative, corresponding to a naturally occurring VHL missense mutation, had no effect. These results suggest that the tumor suppression function of pVHL may be linked to its ability to bind to Elongin B and C."

Here, a cellular transcription factor, Elongin (SIII), is identified as a functional target of the VHL protein. Elongin (SIII) is a heterotrimer consisting of a transcriptionally active subunit (A) and two regulatory subunits (B and C) that activate transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. The VHL protein was shown to bind tightly and specifically to the Elongin B and C subunits and to inhibit Elongin (SIII) transcriptional activity in vitro. These findings reveal a potentially important transcriptional regulatory network in which the VHL protein may play a key role."

https://openalex.org/W1984201646,"p53 has pleiotropic functions including control of genomic plasticity and integrity. Here we report that p53 can bind to several transcription factor IIH-associated factors, including transcription-repair factors, XPD (Rad3) and XPB, as well as CSB involved in strand-specific DNA repair, via its C-terminal domain. We also found that wild-type, but not Arg273His mutant p53 inhibits XPD (Rad3) and XPB DNA helicase activities. Moreover, repair of UV-induced dimers is slower in Li-Fraumeni syndrome cells (heterozygote p53 mutant) than in normal human cells. Our findings indicate that p53 may play a direct role in modulating nucleotide excision repair pathways."

Immunogold electron microscopy showed that ganglioside GM1-enriched caveolae associated with an annular plasmalemmal domain enriched in GPI-anchored proteins. The purified caveolae contained molecular components required for regulated transport, including various lipid-anchored signaling molecules.

Emotionality in mice is such a trait, defined here by covariation in activity and defecation in a novel environment and emergence into the open arms of an elevated plus maze. Behavioral and quantitative trait analyses were conducted on four measures obtained from 879 mice from an F2 intercross. Three loci, on murine chromosomes 1, 12, and 15, were mapped that influence emotionality. This trait, inferred from studies of strain, sex, and individual differences in rodents, may be related to human susceptibility to anxiety or neuroticism."

https://openalex.org/W2024942502,"Insulin stimulates the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) via its upstream activator, MAPK kinase (MEK), a dual specificity kinase that phosphorylates MAPK on threonine and tyrosine. The potential role of MAPK activation in insulin action was investigated with the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059. Insulin stimulation of MAPK activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (2.7-fold) and L6 myotubes (1.4-fold) was completely abolished by pretreatment of cells with the MEK inhibitor, as was the phosphorylation of MAPK and pp90Rsk, and the transcriptional activation of c-fos. Insulin receptor autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase were unaffected. Pretreatment of cells with PD98059 had no effect on basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, lipogenesis, and glycogen synthesis. Glycogen synthase activity in extracts from 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes was increased 3-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively, by insulin. Pretreatment with 10 μM PD98059 was without effect. Similarly, the 2-fold activation of protein phosphatase 1 by insulin was insensitive to PD98059. These results indicate that stimulation of the MAPK pathway by insulin is not required for many of the metabolic activities of the hormone in cultured fat and muscle cells.

Similarly, the 2-fold activation of protein phosphatase 1 by insulin was insensitive to PD98059. These results indicate that stimulation of the MAPK pathway by insulin is not required for many of the metabolic activities of the hormone in cultured fat and muscle cells. Insulin is the most potent physiological anabolic agent known. It promotes the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins and inhibits their degradation and release into the circulation. While the precise intracellular events that mediate insulin action are not well understood, regulation of protein phosphorylation is believed to play a critical role (Saltiel, 1994). The insulin receptor, a heterotetrameric protein complex, undergoes autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues upon binding of hormone, thereby increasing its tyrosine kinase activity and the tyrosine phosphorylation of specific intracellular proteins (Kasuga et al., 1982; Rees-Jones and Taylor, 1985). Distal to receptor activation, insulin regulates serine and threonine phosphorylation, paradoxically stimulating the phosphorylation of some proteins while causing the dephosphorylation of others (Czech et al., 1988; Rosen, 1987; Saltiel, 1990). Many of the serine/threonine phosphorylations induced by insulin are shared by other growth factors. In contrast, the dephosphorylation of proteins observed with insulin is unique. Indeed, many of the rate-limiting enzymes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, such as glycogen synthase, hormone-sensitive lipase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase are regulated through dephosphorylation mechanisms. Thus, these dephosphorylations are likely to be critical to many of the metabolic effects of insulin, including stimulation of glycogen and lipid synthesis, and inhibition of lipolysis. The best characterized pathway leading to insulin-dependent serine phosphorylation is the MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKMAPK kinasePP1type 1 protein phosphatasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSREserum response elementLucluciferasePIphosphatidylinositolFBSfetal bovine serumMAP2microtubule-associated protein 2PBSphosphate-buffered salineDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. cascade. This pathway is initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 or Shc proteins by the receptor kinase, inducing their association with the SH2 domain of the adapter protein Grb2 (Sasaoka et al., 1994b; Skolnik et al., 1993b). This association with phosphorylated Shc induces Grb2 to target the nucleotide exchange factor SOS, which in turn associates with and activates the GTP-binding protein p21Ras (Rozakis-Adcock et al., 1992; Sasaoka et al., 1994a; Skolnik et al., 1993a). p21Ras activation leads to the stimulation of Raf and other kinases (Thomas et al., 1992; Wood et al., 1992). These kinases can phosphorylate MAPK kinase, or MEK (Dent et al., 1992; Kyriakis et al., 1992; Zheng et al., 1994), a dual specificity kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of MAPK on threonine and tyrosine residues, causing its activation (Crews et al., 1992; Kosako et al., 1992). MAPK has a number of substrates, including transcription factors (Gille et al., 1992; Pulverer et al., 1991), phospholipase A2 (Lin et al., 1993; Nemenoff et al., 1993), and other kinases, such as ribosomal S6 kinase II, or pp90Rsk (Sturgill et al., 1988). Dent et al.(1990) have suggested that the phosphorylation and activation of pp90Rsk by activated MAPK increases its activity toward site 1 on the regulatory glycogen-binding subunit (PP1G) of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), based on a series of reconstitution experiments. Increased phosphorylation of this site has also been detected in PP1G isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle following insulin treatment. The phosphorylation of this regulatory subunit produces a 2-fold increase in the PP1-catalyzed dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase kinase, thereby increasing the overall rate of glycogen accumulation. mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase type 1 protein phosphatase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis serum response element luciferase phosphatidylinositol fetal bovine serum microtubule-associated protein 2 phosphate-buffered saline Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. This model has provided an attractive link between the activation of MAPK by insulin and the stimulation of glycogen synthesis, resolving the apparent paradox of simultaneous stimulation of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by insulin. However, there are inconsistencies with this model. We have further evaluated the role of the MAPK pathway in insulin action in the highly responsive 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes. Using a specific inhibitor of MEK, we demonstrate that MAPK activation is not required for insulin stimulation of PP1 activity and glucose metabolism, including glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake, and lipogenesis. 3T3-L1 and L6 cells were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD). DMEM and calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., while fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Hyclone. Porcine insulin was a generous gift from Eli Lilly. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [U-14C]glucose (298 mCi/mmol), and 2-[U-14C]deoxyglucose (323 mCi/mmol) were from DuPont NEN, while UDP-[U-14C]glucose (254 mCi/mmol) was from ICN. Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-MAPK antiserum used for immunoprecipitations was prepared from rabbits immunized with a C-terminal peptide (amino acids 425-445) of pp44Mapk expressed as a GST fusion protein. Anti-ERK1/2 for immunoblotting was obtained from Zymed (San Francisco, CA). SOS polyclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. For ECL detection, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Phosphatidylinositol was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Anti-pp90Rsk and anti-pp70S6K rabbit antisera were generous gifts of Dr. John Blenis (Harvard Medical School). Glycogen phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase were purchased from Sigma, and okadaic acid was obtained from Calbiochem. Other reagents were from Sigma and were of the highest quality available. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum prior to initiation of the differentiation protocol. Differentiation to adipocytes was induced by incubating confluent monolayers for 2 days in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 0.4 μg/ml dexamethasone. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 2 days with 1 μM insulin in DMEM containing 10% FBS. One day after transfer to the same medium without insulin, greater than 85% of the cells expressed the adipocyte phenotype. L6 myoblasts were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS until approximately 50% confluent, at which point differentiation was initiated by conversion to DMEM with 2% FBS. Cell fusion was apparent at day 5, and greater than 85% of the culture expressed the myotube phenotype by day 12. Prior to assay, both adipocyte and myotube cultures were serum-starved for 3 h in Krebs-Ringer buffer with 30 mM Hepes (KRBH; pH 7.4) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2.5 mM glucose. After insulin treatment, cells (100-mm dishes) were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then lysed in HNTG buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 30 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 mM NaF, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Margolis et al., 1990). Cell lysates were centrifuged (10,000 × g; 10 min) to preclear insoluble material, then diluted directly into Laemmli sample buffer. Lysates were then resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-pp90Rsk, anti-ERK1/2, and anti-SOS antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse or horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively. pp44Mapk was immunoprecipitated from denatured cell lysates, as described previously (Mastick et al., 1994), prior to anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Following insulin treatment of cultures in 12-well dishes, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, then lysed in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 70 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Determination of MAPK activity in lysates was performed as described previously (Pang et al., 1993a). After centrifugation (10,000 × g; 10 min) to preclear insoluble material, 10-μl aliquots of cell lysate (5-10 μg of protein) were incubated with approximately 5 μg of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) for 15 min at 25°C in a final volume of 25 μl containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, and 40 μM [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi). After termination of activity by the addition of 4 × Laemmli sample buffer, phosphorylation of MAP2 was determined by resolution on SDS, 6% PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, excision of MAP2 protein from the gel, and Cerenkov counting of incorporated radioactivity. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method with CsCl double-banded DNA as described previously (Yamauchi et al., 1993). Briefly, 10-day fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with 15 μg of the serum response element-luciferase (SRE-Luc) and 5 μg of the Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid DNAs. Twelve hours after transfection, the cells were placed into serum-free Ham's F12 medium for 12 h and incubated with or without PD98059 for 1 h prior to the addition of 100 nM insulin. Whole cell extracts were prepared at various times for the determination of luciferase (Luc) and β-galactosidase activities. To correct for differences in transcription efficiencies between plates within an experiment, the luciferase activity in each extract was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. This was determined as described previously (Ohmichi et al., 1992). Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were precleared of insoluble material by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C), then preincubated with Pansorbin cells and rabbit IgG-agarose before being subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and Protein A-agarose. The resulting pellets were thoroughly washed, and associated PI 3′-kinase activity was determined by the incubation of immunoprecipitates with [32P]ATP and phosphatidylinositol. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate produced was resolved by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. Cells in 12-well dishes were serum-deprived and insulin-treated as above. Assay of glucose uptake was initiated by the addition of 2-[U-14C]deoxyglucose (1 μCi/well) and 5 mM glucose. After a 15-min incubation at 37°C, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 10 mM glucose, then solubilized in 0.5 M NaOH. Samples were then assessed for radioactivity by scintillation counting in Ready Gel (Beckman). The accumulation of glycogen in intact cells was determined by an adaptation of the method of Lawrence et al.(1977), as described previously (Hess et al., 1991). After serum deprivation and pretreatment with or without PD98059, cells in 6-well dishes were incubated in the presence or absence of insulin for an additional 15 min. Subsequently, cells were incubated with 5 mMD-[U-14C]glucose (2 μCi per well) for 60 min at 37°C. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS, solubilized in 30% KOH, and radiolabeled glucose incorporation into glycogen was determined. Alternatively, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (6-well dishes), radiolabeled glucose incorporation into lipid was assessed by scraping cells into 1 ml of PBS and shaking vigorously with 5 ml of Betafluor scintillant (National Diagnostics, Manville, NJ). After samples settled overnight, radioactivity which partitioned into the organic phase was determined by scintillation counting. Insulin stimulation of glycogen synthase activity was determined as described previously (Robinson et al., 1993; Thomas et al., 1968) with some modifications. Cells (100-mm dishes) were serum-deprived in KRBH with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in the absence of glucose for 3 h, pretreated with or without PD98059 for an additional 30 min, then incubated with insulin for 20 min at 37°C. After three washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were scraped into 500 μl of glycogen synthase assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM EDTA, and 100 mM KF) and homogenized with a glass-glass dounce homogenizer prior to centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min). To measure glycogen synthase activity, 50 μl of the supernatant (50-200 μg of protein) was added to an equal volume of original buffer containing 10 mM UDP-[14C]glucose (0.05-0.15 μCi/μmol) and 15 mg/ml glycogen, in the presence or absence of 10 mM glucose 6-phosphate. After a 15-min incubation at 37°C, assay tubes were chilled for 15 min in an ice bath. Tube contents were then spotted on prelabeled Whatman filter papers (GF/A; 2.4 cm) which were immediately immersed in 500 ml of 70% ethanol (4°C), mixed 40 min, then washed two more times in 250 ml of 70% ethanol (15 min and 60 min, respectively) to remove unincorporated substrate from precipitated glycogen. Filters were air-dried, and radioactivity was counted with 5 ml of Ready Gel scintillant. For optimal stimulation of glycogen synthase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, cells were used 8-12 days post-differentiation. Following insulin treatment, cell extracts were prepared in homogenization buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2%β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mg/ml glycogen, 40 μM leupeptin, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) as described previously (Srinivasan and Begum, 1994). PP1 activity in cell extracts (1-3 μg of protein) was determined against 20 μg of substrate ([32P]phosphorylase a) for 7 min at 30°C in 60 μl of homogenization buffer containing 3 nM okadaic acid to block type 2A protein phosphatase activity. After resolution by SDS, 8% PAGE, substrate was excised from the gel, and residual radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. 32P-Labeled phosphorylase a was prepared as described (Cohen et al., 1988). Free [γ-32P]ATP was removed from radiolabeled substrate by the use of Bio-Gel P-6 spin columns (Bio-Rad). As per glycogen synthase activation, optimal activation of PP1 by insulin was observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were 8-12 days post-differentiation. The structure of PD98059 is shown in Fig. 1. This compound is a selective inhibitor of MAPK kinase, or MEK, and is noncompetitive with respect to ATP binding to MEK. 2Dudley, D. T., Pang, L., Decker, S. J., Bridges, A. J., and Saltiel, A. R. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press. 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes were incubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of PD98059 prior to treatment with insulin. MAPK activity was assessed in cell extracts by examining in vitro phosphorylation of the specific substrate MAP2. Insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in a 2.7-fold increase in MAP2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) which was maximal at 5 min and gradually decreased thereafter (Wiese et al., 1995). Pretreatment of adipocytes with PD98059 completely abolished the stimulation of MAPK by insulin, with an IC50 of approximately 1 μM and a maximal inhibitory effect obtained with 10 μM (Fig. 3A). 10 μM PD98059 prevented stimulation of MAPK activity by insulin up to 60 min after hormone treatment (data not shown). Insulin produces a more modest (35%) stimulation of MAPK activity in L6 myotubes. This increase was also completely blocked upon pretreatment of cells with 10 μM inhibitor (Fig. 2B). Basal activities were not significantly affected by incubation with inhibitor alone in either cell line. Ion-exchange chromatography of lysates from 3T3-L1 adipocytes revealed ERK-1 and ERK-2 as the only MAPK family members activated by insulin. PD98059 completely blocked activation by insulin of both forms of the enzyme. 3Lin, A. Y., Kong, X., Saltiel, A. R., Blackshear, P., and Lawrence, J. C. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 18531-18538.

To verify the inhibitory effect of PD98059 on MAPK activation by insulin, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 100 nM insulin in the presence or absence of PD98059. MAPK was immunoprecipitated, and tyrosine phosphorylation was evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 3B). Insulin treatment produced a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp44Mapk. This increased phosphorylation was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by pretreatment of cells with PD98059, with negligible tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK remaining after incubation with 10 μM concentration of the compound. The activation of MAPK also results in a characteristic change in its SDS-PAGE mobility due to threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation (de Vries-Smits et al., 1992). Pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with PD98059 completely blocked the insulin-induced gel shift of MAPK (Fig. 3C). Treatment of cells with insulin has also been shown to increase the activities of other kinases, including pp90Rsk (Erikson, 1991) and pp70S6K (Thomas, 1992). Activation of these kinases requires serine/threonine phosphorylation, also reflected by reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE (Blenis et al., 1991). pp90Rsk is thought to be directly activated by a MAPK-catalyzed phosphorylation (Sturgill et al., 1988). To evaluate the role of MAPK in pp90Rsk phosphorylation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with insulin, and pp90Rsk and pp70S6K were detected by Western blotting. Insulin caused a shift in electrophoretic mobilities of both pp90Rsk and pp70S6K. Prior incubation of cells with 10 μM PD98059 completely prevented the insulin-stimulated shift in pp90Rsk mobility (Fig. 4A), consistent with the successful blockade of MAPK activation in vivo. The mobility shift of pp70S6K was unaffected by inhibitor pretreatment (data not shown), confirming a lack of involvement of MAPK in this particular response to insulin (Ballou et al., 1990; Blenis et al., 1991). In addition to pp90Rsk, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS is also believed to be a direct substrate of MAPK (Waters et al., 1995; Cherniack et al., 1994). Pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the MEK inhibitor completely blocked the insulin-stimulated SOS gel shift characteristic of serine/threonine phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Previous studies have demonstrated that the c-fos serum response element (SRE) mediates the insulin-stimulated transcription of the c-fos gene (Stumpo et al., 1988). This is generally believed to occur via MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of the TCF/Elk-1 and SRF transcription factors (Gille et al., 1992). We therefore examined the effect of the MEK inhibitor on c-fos transcription using the SRE-luciferase (Luc) reporter gene construct (Yamauchi et al., 1993). 3T3-L1 adipocytes transfected with this construct demonstrate 1.6-fold and 1.8-fold increases in luciferase activity following insulin treatments of 1 and 2 h, respectively (Fig. 4C). Pretreatment of cells with PD98059 completely blocked the stimulation of luciferase activity at these time points, in agreement with insulin stimulation of c-fos transcription by a MAPK-dependent pathway. PD98059 inhibits MEK activity in a manner which is not competitive with either substrate (MAPK) or ATP binding and has been shown to be without effect on MAPK activity itself, as well as the activity of other serine kinases.2 Furthermore, nerve growth factor-, epidermal growth factor-, and platelet-derived growth factor-receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation is completely insensitive to PD98059 pretreatment of cells.2 To evaluate the specificity of this compound in blocking MAPK activation in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes, insulin receptor autophosphorylation was evaluated. PD98059 treatment was without effect on insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor, as determined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 5). In the same immunoblot of cell lysates, insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both the 42- and 44-kDa isoforms of MAPK was effectively blocked by pretreatment with 10 μM PD98059. Upon activation, the insulin receptor catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of its major substrate, insulin receptor substrate 1, resulting in its selective association with proteins containing SH2 domains (Sun et al., 1991, 1993). One such protein, PI 3′-kinase, undergoes activation upon occupancy of the SH2 domains of its 85-kDa regulatory subunit (Myers et al., 1992). Pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 10 μM PD98059 did not reduce activation of PI 3′-kinase by insulin, as detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6). Moreover, the MEK inhibitor had no effect on PI 3′-kinase activity when added directly to the in vitro assay (data not shown). Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells respond to insulin treatment with marked increases in glucose uptake and metabolism. Incubation of cells with 100 nM insulin for 15 min produced a 9-fold increase in the uptake of the nonmetabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose in the presence of 5 mM unlabeled glucose (Fig. 7A). This stimulation of glucose transport was unaffected by prior treatment of cells with 10 μM PD98059. Similar results were obtained when 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake was determined in the presence of 100 μM unlabeled glucose (data not shown). These data demonstrate that MAPK activation is not required for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin also increases the rate of lipid synthesis in these cells. Exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to insulin produced a 7-fold increase in the conversion of radiolabeled glucose into lipid (Fig. 7B). This stimulation of lipogenesis was unaffected by pretreatment of cells with 10 μM PD98059. Moreover, the dose-response for insulin stimulation of lipid synthesis (EC50 approximately 3 nM) was not affected by the MEK inhibitor (data not shown). Basal activities were unaltered by the presence of inhibitor in both glucose uptake and lipogenesis assays. The potential role of MAPK activation in the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin was examined in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes by determining the incorporation of 14C-labeled glucose into glycogen in the presence and absence of 10 μM PD98059 (Fig. 8A). Insulin stimulated the rate of glycogen synthesis in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines, with an EC50 of approximately 5 nM in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and 30 nM in L6 myotubes. Concentrations of PD98059 sufficient to completely block insulin stimulation of MAPK activity had no effect on either the sensitivity or maximal stimulation of glycogen synthesis in these cells. The hormonal regulation of glycogen synthesis is primarily mediated by modulation of the activity of glycogen synthase. This enzyme is stimulated by its allosteric activator, glucose 6-phosphate, and by dephosphorylation. Glycogen synthase activity was assayed in lysates from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with 100 nM insulin for 20 min in the absence of extracellular glucose to eliminate the allosteric activation by glucose 6-phosphate that is produced upon insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Insulin treatment produced a 3-fold increase in the glycogen synthase activity ratio, regardless of whether or not cells were pretreated with 10 μM PD98059 (Fig. 8B). Insulin (300 nM) produced a 1.7-fold increase in the glycogen synthase activity ratio in the myotubes, which also was unaffected by pretreatment with 10 μM PD98059 (Fig. 8B). Incubation with inhibitor alone had no effect on basal glycogen synthase activity, and total activity was not significantly altered by insulin and/or PD98059 treatment (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that MAPK activation is not required for insulin stimulation of glycogen synthase activity and the accumulation of glycogen in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes. Stimulation of PP1 activity is believed to be critical for many of the metabolic effects of insulin, including the stimulation of glycogen synthesis (Hess et al., 1991; Tanti et al., 1991). This enzyme was assayed by following the in vitro dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled glycogen phosphorylase in cell lysates (Fig. 9). In order to specifically assay PP1 activity, release of 32P was monitored in the presence of 3 nM okadaic acid, which completely inhibits type 2A protein phosphatase. Insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes produced a 1.8-fold activation of PP1. This enzyme activity was similarly stimulated by insulin in L6 myotubes. In both cell lines, insulin stimulation of PP1 activity was unaffected by prior treatment of cells with 10 μM PD98059, and little or no effect was observed on basal activity. The regulation of protein phosphorylation appears to be a central component in the pleiotropic actions of insulin (Saltiel, 1994). The insulin-dependent autophosphorylation of the receptor and activation of its tyrosine kinase activity leads to the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins, including insulin receptor substrate 1 (Sun et al., 1991) and Shc (Pronk et al., 1993). It is likely that the phosphorylation of these and other receptor substrates induces a series of protein-protein interactions, leading ultimately to changes in serine/threonine phosphorylation levels, paradoxically increasing the activities of both kinases and phosphatases that target numerous intracellular proteins (Czech et al., 1988; Rosen, 1987; Saltiel, 1990). Studies with mutant insulin receptors (McClain, 1990; Moller et al., 1991; Pang et al., 1993b; Pang et al., 1994; Rolband et al., 1993; Takata et al., 1991), wild-type receptors in particular cell lines (Ohmichi et al., 1993), or anti-receptor antibodies (Sung, 1991; Wilden et al., 1992) indicate that the activation of protein serine kinases and phosphatases may diverge at or near the receptor. One pathway leading to serine kinase activation which has been fairly well defined is activation of MAPK. The activity of this enzyme, first detected in insulin-treated 3T3-L1 cells (Ray and Sturgill, 1987), and later found to be activated by a number of other growth factors and mitogens, results from a well characterized cascade of events. While many of the molecular components involved in the activation of downstream serine/threonine kinases such as MAPK have been elucidated, less progress has been made in understanding the events that are more relevant to the metabolic effects of insulin, the activation of serine/threonine phosphatase activity. An attractive model has emerged (Dent et al., 1990) linking MAPK with stimulation of the type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) responsible for activation of glycogen synthase and inactivation of phosphorylase kinase and glycogen phosphorylase. The MAPK-activated pp90Rsk kinase can phosphorylate site 1 on the regulatory G subunit of PP1 in vitro, increasing the activity of the phosphatase toward glycogen synthase and phosphorylase kinase. However, evidence from several studies contradicts a central role for MAPK activation in this particular response. Agents such as phorbol esters or okadaic acid can activate MAPK, yet they antagonize the metabolic effects of insulin (Corvera et al., 1991; Hess et al., 1991). Moreover, platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor potently activate the MAPK pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but are ineffective in stimulating glycogen synthesis, suggesting that MAPK activation is not sufficient to produce this response (Robinson et al., 1993; Wiese et al., 1995). Furthermore, experiments in a number of cell lines expressing wild-type or mutant insulin receptors (Moller et al., 1991; Ohmichi et al., 1993; Pang et al., 1993b; Pang et al., 1994) or downstream effectors (Sakaue et al., 1995) have dissociated MAPK activation from metabolic responses, indicating that activation of this enzyme is not even required for insulin stimulation of glycogen synthesis. However, these latter studies were performed in cell lines not considered representative of the primary target tissues of insulin, especially with regard to glucose metabolism. In order to determine whether MAPK activation is required for insulin stimulation of glucose metabolism in more classical insulin-responsive cell lines, we have studied insulin action and the involvement of MAPK activation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes are well-suited for the study of insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism. In addition to glycogen and lipid synthesis, glucose transport is insulin-sensitive in these cells due to expression of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter, Glut4 (Garcia de Herreros and Birnbaum, 1989). L6 myotubes are also a useful model system for studies of insulin action. Although these cells do not express Glut4, the regulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin via dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase resembles that observed in intact muscle. Using the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059, which blocks the phosphorylation and activation of MAPK in both cell-based and cell-free assays, we have found that complete blockade of MAPK activation and subsequent pp90Rsk phosphorylation was without effect on insulin stimulation of glucose utilization, although both SOS phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of c-fos were completely inhibited. The stimulation of glucose uptake, lipogenesis, and glycogen synthesis were unaltered by blockade of MAPK activation. Moreover, stimulation of glycogen synthase and PP1 activities by insulin were also unaffected by MEK inhibition. The possibility remains that significant activation of PP1 via MAPK-activated pp90Rsk does occur, but is not required due to the potential existence of an alternative pathway for the stimulation of PP1. In the event of such redundant signaling, one might expect the MEK inhibitor to produce decreased insulin sensitivity or maximal response for insulin stimulation of lipid or glycogen accumulation by insulin. However, the dose-response for insulin stimulation of glycogen synthesis was completely unaffected by the abolishment of MAPK activation in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes. These results, obtained in highly responsive fat and muscle cell lines, clearly demonstrate that activation of MAPK is not required for insulin stimulation of glycogen synthesis. The molecular mechanisms by which metabolic enzymes such as glycogen synthase are regulated by insulin remains one of the crucial, unresolved issues in insulin action. While there is considerable evidence that these enzymes are modulated via dephosphorylation mechanisms likely to be catalyzed by protein phosphatase 1 activity, the precise pathway linking the insulin receptor to this activity requires further study"

Elongin is a heterotrimer composed of A, B, and C subunits of 110, 18, and 15 kilodaltons, respectively. Here, the mammalian Elongin A gene was isolated and expressed, and the Elongin (SIII) complex reconstituted with recombinant subunits. Elongin A is shown to function as the transcriptionally active component of Elongin (SIII) and Elongin B and C as regulatory subunits. Whereas Elongin C assembles with Elongin A to form an AC complex with increased specific activity, Elongin B, a member of the ubiquitin-homology gene family, appears to serve a chaperone-like function, facilitating assembly and enhancing stability of the Elongin (SIII) complex."

In 45 patients from breast and/or ovarian cancer families we found six novel mutations: two single nucleotide insertions, three small deletions (1–5 bp) and a nonsense mutation identified two unrelated families. Furthermore, we were able to amplify the remaining coding region by RT–PCR using lymphocyte RNA. Combined with PTT, we detected aberrantly spliced products affecting exons 5 and 6 in one of two BRCA1–linked families examined. The protein truncation test promises to become a valuable technique in detecting BRCA1 mutations."

Transcriptionally silent heterochromatin of unknown function is associated with centromeres in many organisms. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the silent mating-type loci, centromeres, and telomeres are assembled into silent heterochromatin-like domains. The Swi6 chromodomain protein affects this silencing, and now it is shown that Swi6p localizes with these three chromosomal regions. In cells lacking Swi6p, centromeres lag on the spindle during anaphase and chromosomes are lost at high rates. Thus, Swi6p is located at fission yeast centromeres and is required for their proper function."

Laser flash excitation generates the highly reducing singlet excited state of the (porphinato)zinc chromophore that can subsequently be electron transfer quenched by the (porphinato)iron(III) chloride moiety. Measurement of the photoinduced electron transfer rate constants enables a direct comparison of how well these three types of chemical interactions facilitate electron tunneling. In contrast to generally accepted theory, electronic coupling modulated by a hydrogen-bond interface is greater than that provided by an analogous interface composed entirely of carbon-carbon sigma bonds. These results bear considerably on the analysis of through-protein electron transfer rate data as well as on the power of theory to predict the path traversed by the tunneling electron in a biological matrix; moreover, they underscore the cardinal role played by hydrogen bonds in biological electron transfer processes."

This polarity is due to the ability of the su(Hw)-binding region to form a chromatin insulator. Mutations in modifier of mdg4 (mod(mdg4)) enhance the effect of su(Hw) by inhibiting the function of enhancers located on both sides of the su(Hw)-binding region. This inhibition results in a variegated expression pattern, and mutations in mod(mdg4) act as classical enhancers of position-effect variegation. The mod(mdg4) and su(Hw) proteins interact with each other. The mod(mdg4) protein controls the nature of the repressive effect of su(Hw): in the absence of mod(mdg4) protein, su(Hw) exerts a bidirectional silencing effect, whereas in the presence of mod(mdg4), the silencing effect is transformed into unidirectional repression."

Here, in vitro experiments show that homing of the yeast mtDNA group II intron aI2 occurs by reverse transcription at a double-strand break in the recipient DNA. A site-specific endonuclease cleaves the antisense strand of recipient DNA at position +10 of exon 3 and the sense strand at the intron insertion site. Reverse transcription of aI2-containing pre-mRNA is primed by the antisense strand cleaved in exon 3 and results in cotransfer of the intron and flanking exon sequences. Remarkably, the DNA endonuclease that initiates homing requires both the aI2 reverse transcriptase protein and aI2 RNA. Parallels in their reverse transcription mechanisms raise the possibility that mobile group II introns were ancestors of nuclear non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons and telomerases."

INTRODUCTIONIn humans and yeast bulky DNA lesions are removed from DNA by an ATP-dependent multisubunit enzyme system which excises 27-29-nt 1The abbreviations used are: ntnucleotide(s)bpbase pair(s)CFEcell-free extractXPxeroderma pigmentosumMBPmaltose-binding protein. -long oligomers by incising the 3-5th phosphodiester bonds 3′ and the 22-24th phosphodiester bonds 5′ to the lesion (Huang et al., 1992; Reardon et al., 1993). Of the 16-17 polypeptides required for excision, studies with the yeast homologs of human proteins (Prakash et al., 1993; Friedberg et al., 1995) have proposed two strong candidates for making the dual incisions. RAD2 which is the homolog of XPG is a single-strand specific endonuclease (Habraken et al., 1993). The RAD1•RAD10 complex which is the homolog of XPF•ERCC1 is an endonuclease with preference for single-stranded and supercoiled DNA (Tomkinson et al., 1993; Sung et al., 1993). Furthermore, human XPG protein has been also shown to have single-strand specific DNA endonuclease activity using recombinant protein from baculovirus system (O'Donovan et al., 1994a; Habraken et al., 1994a).Recently, model DNA structures have been used with these proteins in an effort to identify which subunit in the excision nuclease complex makes which incision. Using partial duplexes with single-stranded tails or a flap structure as substrates and a truncated RAD2 protein, Harrington and Lieber(1994) concluded that RAD2 makes the 3′ incision and suggested that RAD1•RAD10 complex makes the 5′ nick. In apparent agreement with this it was found that purified recombinant XPG protein cleaved the junction of a duplex with single-stranded arms only in the strand with the 5′ single-stranded tail (O'Donovan et al., 1994b) and the yeast RAD1•RAD10 complex cleaved only the strand with the 3′ single-stranded tail (Bardwell et al., 1994).However, two recent studies have raised some questions regarding the roles of these RAD and XP proteins in the dual incisions of the excinuclease. First, it was found that the RAD1 protein alone was capable of incising at the Holliday junction (Habraken et al., 1994b), revealing that RAD1 contained the nuclease active site of the RAD1•RAD10 complex. Second, it was also found that RAD2 and XPG possessed 5′→3′ exonuclease activity (Habraken et al., 1994c), leading to the suggestion that scission on the 3′ side was made by RAD1•RAD10 (XPF•ERCC1) followed by 5′ incision by RAD2 (XPG). Furthermore, it was proposed that RAD2 (XPG) digests the excised oligomer 5′ to 3′ to create a single-stranded gap necessary for the helicase functions of RAD3 (XPD) and RAD25 (XPB).We wished to address the question using the excision assay of high specificity and sensitivity as well as incision assays and damaged DNA as substrate. Carrying out experiments with cell-free extracts (CFEs) and a defined system, and employing anti-XPG and anti-ERCC1 antibodies, lead us to conclude that in humans XPG makes the 3′ and XPF•ERCC1 makes the 5′ incision. Furthermore, we suggest that in human excinuclease the two incisions can occur independently under certain conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHeLa S3 cells were from the stock of Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (University of North Carolina). Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cell lines used in this study were: XP-A (GM02345B), XP-B (GM02252A), XP-C (GM02248B), XP-D (GM02253D), XP-E (CW3), XP-F (GM08437A), and XPG (AG08802 and GM03021A). The SV40-transformed XP2RO cell line (CW3) was obtained from R. Moses (Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR) via S. Linn (University of California, Berkeley). The XP-G lymphoblastoid cell line (AG08802) was a gift from K. H. Kraemer (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The other human mutants were purchased from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Human Mutant Cell Repository (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ). Chinese hamster ovary mutant cell lines, UV20(ERCC-1), UV41(ERCC-4=XP-F), and UV135(ERCC-5=XP-G), were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection Repository (Rockville, MD).Amylose resin, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs. Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA polymerase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and prestained protein markers were from Life Technologies, Inc.XPG and ERCC1 Fusion ProteinsWe constructed XPG and ERCC1 fusion proteins to produce antibodies. The plasmid pRAD2-synthetic carrying the human XPG cDNA (Scherly et al., 1993) was kindly provided by S. G. Clarkson (University of Geneva Medical School). The XPG in this construct was subcloned into a pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs) in-frame with malE to obtain pMAL-XPG which overproduces XPG fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP). The construction of pMAL-ERCC1 has been described previously (Park and Sancar, 1993). The MBP-XPG and MBP-ERCC1 fusion proteins were overproduced in E. coli DR153/pMAL-XPG and DH5αF‘lacIq/pMAL-ERCC1, respectively. The proteins were purified through an amylose column as described by the manufacturer.Antibody Production and ImmunoblottingRabbit polyclonal anti-XPG and anti-ERCC1 antibodies were raised against MBP-XPG and MBP-ERCC1, respectively, by standard procedures. The anti-XPG antibodies were affinity-purified using a column containing the MBP-XPG fusion protein immobilized to AminoLink Plus Coupling Gel (Pierce). The purified antibodies were dialyzed against storage buffer (25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 17% glycerol) and stored in small aliquots at −20°C. Immunoblotting was performed by standard procedures.SubstratesThe substrate was a 140-bp duplex containing a cholesterol attached to a propanediol backbone instead of a nucleoside at position 70 of the “damaged” strand (Fig. 1A). In an extensive survey of commercially available modified bases and base analogs (including 2-amino-butyl-1,3-propanediol, biotin, and Texas red) we have found cholesterol-containing DNA (Clontech) to be the best substrate for human excinuclease. In contrast with other lesions such as thymine dimer, psoralen monoadduct or acetylaminofluorene-guanine adduct, this “lesion” is incorporated into a desired sequence by standard phosphoramidite chemistry and hence is readily available in large quantities.Depending on the type of experiment performed we used internally labeled, 5′-labeled or 3′-labeled substrates (Fig. 1B). Internally labeled substrate was assembled from 6 oligonucleotides as shown in Fig. 1A (Huang et al., 1994). The 32P label was at the 6th phosphodiester bond 5′ to the lesion. The 5′-labeled substrate was prepared by labeling the 140-nt-long single-stranded oligomer with the lesion using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, followed by annealing to the complementary oligonucleotide. For 3′ end-labeling the two 140-nt oligomers were annealed and incubated with [α-32P]dCTP, dATP, and Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. Filling-in the one nucleotide gap generates a duplex of 141 bp with blunt ends. The unmodified and cholesterol-containing oligomers were synthesized by Operon Biotechnologies and Midland Certified Reagents.Repair AssaysCFEs prepared by the method of Manley et al.(1980) or the recently developed reconstituted system (Mu et al., 1995) were used to measure excision (release of an oligomer containing damage by dual incisions) or incision (detection of one of the incision sites relative to the lesion using terminally labeled DNA). The excision assay was performed as described previously (Huang et al., 1992, 1994). Briefly, the reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 32.5 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 4.4 mM MgCl2, 0.15 mM EDTA, 0.4 mM dithiothreitol, 1.7% glycerol, 2 mM ATP, 100 μM of each dNTP, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, ~1 nM internally labeled substrate, and 50 μg of CFE. The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 45 min unless indicated otherwise and the products were deproteinized, ethanol-precipitated, and resolved on 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. The incision assay was conducted similarly except the substrate was terminally labeled and dNTPs were omitted. Excision assay with the reconstituted system was performed by mixing 5 highly purified fractions as described previously (Mu et al., 1995): MBP-XPA (I), TFIIH/XPG (II), XPC (III), ERCC1•XPF (IV), and recombinant replication protein A (V). Quantitation of excision (oligomers in the 23-29-nt range) relative to the recovery of added substrate was determined by scanning autoradiographs with a Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer Series 300 instrument.Analysis of the Excision ProductsThe location of cholesterol relative to the termini of the excised fragment was determined by using the 3′→5′ exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase as described previously (Huang et al., 1992; Svoboda et al., 1993).RESULTSSpecificity of Anti-XPG and Anti-ERCC1 AntibodiesSince the effect of antibodies played a central role in our analyses of the incision reactions, it was important to have high-specificity antibodies. In fact, antiserum raised against ERCC1 (α-ERCC1) was of high titer and gave clear signal without prior purification (Mu et al., 1995). However, since the anti-XPG serum (α-XPG) showed high background, specific antibodies were obtained by affinity chromatography. Fig. 2A shows that of all of the XP cell lines tested only the two XP-G mutants lack the immunoreactive ~180-kDa protein which we identify as XPG in agreement with highly purified protein preparations (O'Donovan et al., 1994a; Habraken et al., 1994a). In one XPG mutant (GM03021A) with residual excision activity (Reardon et al., 1993), a truncated XPG protein of ~140 kDa was reproducibly detected, although the signal was too faint in this particular experiment (lane 9). Similarly, α-ERCC1 revealed a specific band of ~40 kDa in all of XP cell lines tested (Fig. 2B) in agreement with previous reports that ERCC1 does not correspond to any XP gene (van Duin et al., 1988) or protein (Reardon et al., 1993). The variability in relative intensity may be real as in the case of XP-F with low intensity as has been reported (Biggerstaff et al., 1993) or simply a reflection of the quality of extract. In any event, Fig. 2reveals that our α-XPG and α-ERCC1 are of sufficient specificity for use in functional assays.Figure 2:Specificity of anti-XPG and anti-ERCC1 antibodies. CFEs (100 μg each) from HeLa (lane 1) and various XP cell lines (lanes 2-9) as described under “Experimental Procedures” were separated by 8% (A) or 10% (B) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting with α-XPG or α-ERCC1, respectively. In experiment A, XP-G CFE prepared from GM03021A (lane 9) in addition to AG08802 (lane 8) was used. The positions of prestained protein markers in kDa are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of Anti-XPG and Anti-ERCC1 Antibodies on Dual IncisionsTo study the roles of XPG and XPF•ERCC1 complex in the dual incisions, we conducted excision assays in the presence of either α-XPG or α-ERCC1. Fig. 3A shows a unique effect of α-XPG on the excision reaction. At low concentration it enhances the excision of the 29-mer (7-fold) while having only mild inhibitory effect (33%) on the overall excision (lane 4); at higher concentration the 29-mer becomes a major excision product concomitant with more pronounced overall inhibition (67%) of 23-29-mer excision products (lane 5). Both effects can be reversed with appropriate amounts of the antigen (lanes 6 and 7). Excision in the presence of α-ERCC1 revealed only inhibition of excision by the antibodies (lanes 8 and 9, 87 and 94%, respectively) which was reversed by addition of recombinant ERCC1 (lanes 10 and 11). The unusual effect of α-XPG led us to investigate these findings in more detail.Figure 3:Effects of anti-XPG and anti-ERCC1 antibodies on dual incisions. A, the indicated amounts of antibodies (Ab), preimmune, α-XPG, or α-ERCC1 were preincubated (for 10 min on ice) with HeLa CFE (50 μg) in the absence (lanes 1-5, 8, and 9) or presence of antigen (Ag), MBP-XPG (lanes 6 and 7), or MBP-ERCC1 (lanes 10 and 11), and then added to the reaction mixtures containing the internally labeled substrate (140-bp). The excision products were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel and the positions of the substrate (140-mer) and the products (27- and 29-mers) are indicated. B, the excision products were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel for longer periods to increase the resolution of larger fragments. Two μl of α-XPG were used (lane 3) and the positions of DNA size markers (φX174/HinfI) are indicated in the left margin. Right panel, schematic drawings of the incision pattern of human excinuclease on the internally labeled 140-bp substrate. In the absence of antibodies, 7.1% of the damage was excised as determined by the intensity of the bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Anti-XPG Antibodies Affect the Site of the 3′ IncisionThe larger excision fragment induced by α-XPG could be due to a change in the 3′ or 5′ incision site or both. To differentiate among these possibilities we cut out from the gel the 27-mer major excision product and the 29-mer induced by α-XPG and treated the excised fragments with T4 DNA polymerase 3′→5′ exonuclease (Fig. 4). This activity is inhibited by lesions in DNA (Fuchs, 1984). The exonuclease treatment generates the same size fragment (26-mer) from both the 29-mer and the 27-mer (lanes 5 and 7, respectively). Thus, we conclude that α-XPG shifts the 3′ incision site without affecting the site of 5′ incision. Two possibilities were considered for this effect. Either XPG is at the 5′ incision site and when bound to antibodies the entire incision complex is displaced causing a change of incision site by XPF•ERCC1 located at the 3′ site, or XPG makes the 3′ incision and a subpopulation of the antibodies upon binding to XPG do not inhibit the incision reaction but displace the protein slightly such that the 5th phosphodiester bond which is normally attacked by XPG at a low frequency becomes a major target.Figure 4:Perturbation of the 3′ incision site by anti-XPG antibodies. After excision reaction with HeLa CFE in the presence of α-XPG, the products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and the 27-mer major excision product and the 29-mer induced by α-XPG were cut out from the gel. The eluted products were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel untreated (lanes 4 and 6) or after treatment with T4 DNA polymerase 3′→5′ exonuclease (lanes 5 and 7). For comparison, the products from excision reaction without (lane 2) or with (lane 3) α-XPG (1 μl) were also examined. The positions of the markers (30-mer) and the products (26-, 27-, and 29-mers) are indicated. The excised fragments containing a cholesterol molecule migrate 1 nt slower than unmodified DNA of the same length (see Fig. 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We reasoned that looking at the particular incision sites under α-XPG inhibitory conditions would help answer these questions. Indeed, higher resolution gels reveal that α-XPG, in addition to the two effects observed in Fig. 3A, also caused the appearance of a 95 nt-long fragment with this internally labeled substrate (Fig. 3B). This fragment corresponds to incision at the 25th phosphodiester bond 5′ to the lesion and hence represents an “uncoupled” 5′ incision 2Uncoupled 5′ or 3′ incisions refer, respectively, to reactions in which the excinuclease makes the 5′ incision but fails to make the 3′ incision or vice versa. (see below). Our polyclonal antibodies must have at least two types of antibodies. One binds to XPG and changes its specificity; the other inhibits its function and causes the excinuclease to make only the 5′ incision. Taken together these data are consistent with XPG making the 3′ incision.Analysis of XPG and XPF•ERCC1 Functions by the 3′ Incision AssayIn this assay terminally labeled substrate was incubated with the enzyme system and the activity was monitored by appearance of bands due to incision 5′ or 3′ to the lesion. Fig. 5shows the result of such an assay with 3′-labeled substrate. HeLa CFE makes a major incision at the 3rd phosphodiester bond 3′ to the lesion, an infrequent incision at the 4th and a moderate level of incisions at the 2nd and 5th phosphodiester bonds 3′ to the lesion (lane 2). The incisions are specific to human excinuclease because the bands are absent from DNA treated with CFEs from XP-F (lane 3) and XP-G (lane 4) mutants and can be restored by mixing the two mutant extracts (lane 5). This conclusion is further supported by similar assays with Chinese hamster ovary excision repair mutants. UV20 (ERCC-1) (lane 6), UV41 (XP-F) (lane 7), and UV135 (XP-G) (lane 8) do not show 3′ incision consistent with lack of excision (Reardon et al., 1993) and repair synthesis (O'Donovan and Wood, 1993) by these mutants. Furthermore, CFEs of ERCC-1 and ERCC-4 (XP-F) mutants fail to complement in the incision assay (lane 9), consistent with the conclusions that these two proteins are in a tight complex which does not exchange subunits readily in vitro (Reardon et al., 1993). In contrast, CFEs of UV20 plus UV135 and UV41 plus UV135 do complement (lanes 10 and 11, respectively). In these latter two the 3′ incision occurs with about equal frequency at the 3rd and 5th phosphodiester bonds.Figure 5:Incision assay with 3′-labeled substrate (3′ incision assay). Fifty μg of HeLa CFE (lane 2) or mutant CFEs (lanes 3, 4 and 6-8) were incubated with 3′ end-labeled substrate at 30°C for 60 min. In complementation reactions (lanes 5 and 9-11), 25 μg from each cell line was premixed and then added to the reaction mixture. The products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Lane 1 shows the Maxam-Gilbert reaction of G+A. The arrow and triangles indicate the major 3′ incision site. The position of the substrate (141-mer) is also indicated. As determined by the intensity of the bands relative to the total amount of the DNA, 9.3% of the total radioactivity was detected in the 67-70-nt region with HeLa CFE (lane 2), in contrast to 0.2-0.8% (background) with mutant CFEs (lanes 3, 4, and 6-8). In complementation reactions (lanes 5, 10, and 11), 4.8-5.6% of that was detected in this region (i.e. approximately 50-60% complementation). CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Having thus shown that the 3′ incision can be detected in this assay with 3′-labeled DNA, we wished to confirm the observations we made with the internally labeled substrate using the 3′ incision assay. Fig. 6shows the results of such an assay. The α-XPG has two specific effects in addition to overall inhibition of 3′ incision (lanes 5 and 6, 71 and 88% inhibition, respectively): first, they reverse the frequency of incisions at the 3rd and 5th phosphodiester bonds 3′ to the lesion (lane 5, ratio of incisions is 1 to 1.7) compared to the control (lane 1, ratio of 1 to 0.4); second, they give rise to a band at position 96 (corresponding to position 95 in the 140-bp substrates) which can only be generated from a 5′ incision uncoupled from 3′ incision (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with the data obtained with the internally labeled substrate. In contrast, α-ERCC1 inhibits 3′ incision entirely but does not produce the uncoupled 5′ incision, indicating that α-ERCC1 possibly inhibits 5′ incision as well. Further experiments were conducted with 5′-labeled substrate to ascertain our conclusions regarding the roles of XPG and XPF•ERCC1 on 5′ incision.Figure 6:Effects of anti-XPG and anti-ERCC1 antibodies on the 3′ incision. HeLa CFE (50 μg) was preincubated (for 10 min on ice) with the indicated amounts of antibodies (Ab), preimmune (lanes 2 and 3), α-XPG (lanes 5 and 6), or α-ERCC1 (lanes 7 and 8), and then added to the reaction mixture containing 3′ end-labeled substrate (30°C, 60 min). The products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Lane 4 shows the Maxam-Gilbert reaction of G+A. The closed arrows and triangles indicate the major 3′ incision sites and the open arrows and triangles indicate the uncoupled 5′ incision site. The position of the substrate (141-mer) is also indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Incision Assay with 5′-Labeled DNAIn Fig. 7we show that HeLa CFE makes several incisions centered around the incision at the 25th phosphodiester bond 5′ to the lesion (lane 3). These bands are not produced by XP-F (lane 4) or XP-G (lane 5) extracts and the activity is restored by mixing the two extracts (lane 6). Mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines UV20 (ERCC-1), UV41 (XP-F), and UV135 (XP-G) are also defective in 5′ incision (lanes 7-9), and the combination of UV20 + UV41 again fails to restore the activity (lane 10) but UV20 + UV135 and UV41 + UV135 combinations show complementation of the incision activity (lanes 11 and 12). These results taken together with those in Fig. 5 reveal that the lack of excision (Reardon et al., 1993) and repair synthesis (O'Donovan and Wood, 1993) is due to the lack of both 3′ and 5′ incisions in the mutant cell lines. In addition, we could not detect any (uncoupled) 3′ and 5′ incisions in all other XP mutant CFEs used in this study. 3T. Matsunaga and A. Sancar, unpublished results. Figure 7:Incision assay with 5′-labeled substrate (5′ incision assay). Fifty μg of HeLa CFE (lane 3) or mutant CFEs (lanes 4, 5, and 7-9) were incubated with 5′ end-labeled substrate at 23°C (to reduce nonspecific degradation) for 60 min. In complementation reactions (lanes 6 and 10-12), 25 μg from each cell line was premixed and then added to the reaction mixture. The products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The products of PvuII restriction digestion (lane 1) and the Maxam-Gilbert reaction of G+A (lane 2) were used for determining the incision sites. The closed arrow and triangles indicate the major 5′ incision site in human CFE and the open arrow and triangles indicate that in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) CFE. The position of the substrate (140-mer) is also indicated. As determined by the intensity of the bands relative to the total amount of the DNA, 9.8% of the total radioactivity was detected in the 44-49-nt region with HeLa CFE (lane 3), in contrast to 1.6-2.2% (background) with mutant CFEs (lanes 4, 5, and 7-9). In complementation reactions (lanes 6, 11, and 12), 3.7-5.1% of that was detected in this region (i.e. approximately 37-52% complementation).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Having established a 5′ incision assay, we then investigated the effects of antibodies on the 5′ incision. Fig. 8 shows that α-XPG inhibits 5′ incision only moderately (lanes 5 and 6, 6 and 53% inhibition, respectively) compared to the control preimmune serum (lanes 3 and 4, 4 and 21%, respectively), whereas α-ERCC1 inhibits the 5′ incision as efficiently as the 3′ incision (lanes 7 and 8, 69 and 80%, respectively). Hence, we conclude that a subset of α-XPG inhibits the 3′ incision but not the 5′ incision, while α-ERCC1 inhibits both the 3′ and 5′ incisions. Our data up to this point strongly suggest that XPG makes the 3′ incision and XPF (in the form of XPF•ERCC1 complex) makes the 5′ incision and further that the 5′ incision can occur without the 3′ incision. The inhibition of both 5′ and 3′ incision by α-ERCC1 could be by two mechanisms. First, the 5′ incision is made initially and inhibition of this incision indirectly prevents 3′ incision; second, the XPF•ERCC1 complex is essential for the assembly of the excinuclease complex and prevention of binding of XPF•ERCC1 to the other subunits of the excinuclease results in complete inhibition of any nicking activity.Figure 8:Effects of anti-XPG and anti-ERCC1 antibodies on the 5′ incision. HeLa CFE (50 μg) was preincubated (for 10 min on ice) with the indicated amounts of antibodies (Ab), preimmune (lanes 3 and 4), α-XPG (lanes 5 and 6), or α-ERCC1 (lanes 7 and 8), and then added to the reaction mixture containing 5′ end-labeled substrate (23°C, 60 min). The products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Lane 1 shows the Maxam-Gilbert reaction of G+A. The arrows indicate the 5′ incision sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Order of IncisionsIn E. coli (A)BC excinuclease the UvrB makes the 3′ incision and then UvrC makes the 5′ nick (Lin et al., 1992). If UvrB fails to make the 3′ incision UvrC cannot incise 5′ even when it is bound to the UvrB•DNA complex (Lin and Sancar, 1992). The total lack of both 3′ and 5′ nicking activity in XP-F and ERCC-1 mutants and the proportional inhibition of both nicking by α-ERCC1 but not by α-XPG combined with the observation of uncoupled 5′ incision in the presence of α-XPG (Fig. 5-8) suggested that the opposite may be the case in humans: 5′ incision must be made by XPF•ERCC1 before XPG can incise at the 3′ side. This model would exclude the production of 3′ uncoupled nicks. In fact, we have never observed the bands corresponding to the 3′ uncoupled nicks in the HeLa CFE system. However, in a highly defined system which we have recently established (Mu et al., 1995), a band (72-mer) generated by the possible uncoupled 3′ incision was often detected. Fig. 9A shows that excision is accompanied by the appearance of a 72-nt-long fragment only when all 5 fractions were used (lane 2), indicating that the production of the 72-mer is specific to human excinuclease activity. To confirm the specificity of this nick the excision reaction was performed in the presence of α-XPG. Fig. 9B shows that the antibodies specifically inhibit the appearance of the 72-mer fragment in addition to excised fragments (23-27-mers) by dual incisions while simultaneously enhancing the intensity of bands in the 91-96-mer region. These data are consistent with α-XPG inhibiting 3′ incision (72-mer) and excision (23-27-mers) without significantly affecting the 5′ incision. Thus, we conclude that the 72-mer band arose from uncoupled 3′ incision and that in humans 3′ and 5′ incisions can occur independent of one anothe"

A mutation was introduced into the GTP-binding domain of FtsY that altered its nucleotide specificity from GTP to xanthosine triphosphate (XTP). The mutant FtsY protein stimulated GTP hydrolysis by a ribonucleoprotein consisting of Ffh and 4.5S RNA in a reaction that required XTP, and it hydrolyzed XTP in a reaction that required both the Ffh-4.5S ribonucleoprotein and GTP. Thus, nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis by Ffh and FtsY is likely to occur in reciprocally coupled reactions in which the two interacting guanosine triphosphatases act as regulatory proteins for each other."

In contrast, hybrids that retain human chromosome 11 and additional human chromosomes fail to activate myoD. We show that human chromosome 4 inhibits myoD activation. myoD enhancer/promoter reporter constructs show that repression is at the transcriptional level. Chromosome fragment-containing hybrids localize the repressing activity to the region of 4p that contains the homeobox gene MSX1. MSX1 is expressed in primary human fibroblasts and in 10T1/2 cells containing human chromosome 4, while parental 10T1/2 cells do not express Msx1. Forced expression of Msx1 represses myoD enhancer activity. Msx1 protein binds to the myoD enhancer and likely represses myoD transcription directly. Antisense MSX1 relieves repression mediated by chromosome 4. We conclude that MSX1 inhibits transcription of myoD and that myoD is a target for homeobox gene regulation."

To determine the mechanism of promoter selectivity, we have analyzed the activity of the Adh promoters both in vitro and in transfected cells. We found that selective promoter utilization is controlled by distinct initiator elements. Reconstitution of Adh transcription with purified components requires a specific TBP-TAF complex that, in concert with TFIIA, directs differential Adh promoter transcription. Fractionation of this TBP-TAF complex reveals that TAFII150 is required for discrimination between the proximal and distal promoters. We propose a mechanism for regulating differential promoter utilization during Drosophila development that involves the recognition of specific initiator elements by TAFs in the TFIID complex."

https://openalex.org/W2108467885,"The hepatic transport systems mediating bile acid uptake and excretion undergo independent, stage-specific expression during development in the rat. In this study, the mechanisms underlying ontogenic regulation of both the Na+-dependent basolateral bile acid transporter and canalicular bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase were examined. Steady state mRNA levels for the basolateral transporter were less than 20% of adult values prior to birth, increased to 35% on the first postnatal day, and reached adult levels by 1 week of age. This was paralleled by transcription rates, which were low prior to birth, reached 47% by day 1, and were maximal by 1 week of age. Steady state mRNA levels for ecto-ATPase were 12% of adult values prior to birth and showed a 2-fold increase by the first day of life. Thereafter, there was a gradual increase in mRNA for this transporter, with adult levels being reached at 4 weeks of age. Transcription rates paralleled this increment, although adult levels were reached earlier. Surprisingly, for both transporters, the full complement of protein was present well before adult levels of mRNA were reached. The basolateral protein was expressed at 82% of adult levels on the first day of life but was of lower apparent molecular mass (39 kDa), a difference that persisted until 4 weeks of age. N-Glycanase digestion suggested that this difference could be fully accounted for by N-linked glycosylation. The ecto-ATPase protein was present at 33% of adult levels prior to birth, 77% by 1 day, and 84% of adult levels by 1 week of age. Unlike the basolateral transporter, the apparent molecular weight of this protein did not change during development. In summary, the ontogeny of bile acid transporters on the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte is complex and appears to be regulated at transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. The hepatic transport systems mediating bile acid uptake and excretion undergo independent, stage-specific expression during development in the rat. In this study, the mechanisms underlying ontogenic regulation of both the Na+-dependent basolateral bile acid transporter and canalicular bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase were examined.

Unlike the basolateral transporter, the apparent molecular weight of this protein did not change during development. In summary, the ontogeny of bile acid transporters on the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte is complex and appears to be regulated at transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels. The process of bile formation is immature at birth and is related, in part, to a reduced capacity of the developing liver for bile acid uptake and excretion(1Suchy F.J. Bucuvalas J.C. Novak D.A. Semin. Liver. Dis. 1987; 7: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A key finding from our previous studies employing highly purified plasma membrane vesicles has been that hepatocyte transport mechanisms for bile acids are developmentally regulated and are expressed independently on the basolateral and canalicular membranes at specific times during the perinatal period(2Suchy F.J. Bucuvalas J.C. Goodrich A.L. Moyer M.S. Blitzer B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G665-G673PubMed Google Scholar, 3Novak D.A. Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G743-G751PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the developmental expression of these transport activities are unknown but are likely to involve transcriptional, translational, and post-translational events. The differential timing for the expression of these transporters would indicate that different modes of regulation may be required for the ontogenesis of each system. Bile acid uptake across the basolateral membrane occurs largely via a sodium-dependent cotransport system, which exhibits a sodium to bile acid ratio of greater than 1:1(4Yamazaki M. Sugiyama Y. Suzuki H. Iga T. Hanano M. J. Hepatol. 1992; 14: 54-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the rat liver sodium/bile acid cotransporter (Ntcp) has recently been cloned by Hagenbuch and associates (5Hagenbuch B. Lubbert H. Stieger B. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5357-5360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The transporter has a molecular mass of ~50 kDa and is glycosylated(7Ananthanaryanan M. Ng O.C. Boyer J.L. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G637-G643PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium-dependent bile acid uptake is not present in the rat throughout most of gestation but is abruptly expressed on fetal day 20 (2Suchy F.J. Bucuvalas J.C. Goodrich A.L. Moyer M.S. Blitzer B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G665-G673PubMed Google Scholar). It could not be determined from these studies whether the bile acid carrier was absent or present but not functional during fetal development. Following birth, there is a progressive rise in the Vmax for taurocholate uptake to reach 75% of the adult rate by 4 weeks of age(8Suchy F.J. Courchene S.M. Blitzer B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: G648-G654PubMed Google Scholar). These functional studies were interpreted as being consistent with a reduced number or translocation rate of specific taurocholate carriers during development. In preliminary studies we have reported that mRNA transcripts for the sodium-dependent cotransporter were low during fetal life and then roughly paralleled the increase in transport activity postnatally(9Boyer J.L. Hagenbuch B. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, in these studies, a limited range of age groups was examined. Moreover, it is uncertain how steady state mRNA levels for the transporter correlate with rates of transcription or with the amount of transport protein detected within the plasma membrane. Excretion of bile acids at the canalicular membrane is the rate-limiting step in hepatocellular transport of bile acids(10Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1971; 221: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several distinct carrier mechanisms for bile acids have now been identified in studies employing canalicular membrane vesicles. The predominant low affinity, high capacity system is sodium independent, saturable, and driven by the membrane electrical potential(11Meier P.J. Meir-Abt A.S. Boyer J.L. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This mechanism is ontogenically regulated in that the transport activity is not detected in neonatal rat canalicular membrane vesicles during the first week of life but is expressed at near adult levels by day 14 of postnatal age(3Novak D.A. Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G743-G751PubMed Google Scholar). A high affinity, low capacity transporter for conjugated bile acids, which is ATP dependent, has also been described (12Adachi Y. Kobayashi H. Kurumi Y. Shouji M. Kitano M. Yamamoto T. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 655-659PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, we have found that this transporter is expressed during the first week of life at approximately 60% of the adult transport Vmax. The molecular identities of these transport systems have not been precisely defined, but several groups have identified a ~100-kDa bile acid transport protein using affinity chromatographic techniques(13Reutz S. Fricker G. Hugentobler G. Winterhalter K. Kurz G. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11324-11330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18920-18926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the 100-kDa protein purified from canalicular membranes by bile acid affinity chromatography in our laboratory showed it to be identical to a rat liver ecto-ATPase/cell CAM 105(16Lin S.H. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14408-14414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 266: 14403-14407Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We have also previously demonstrated canalicular membrane localization of this protein in developing and adult animals in immunofluorescence studies using a polyclonal antibody(3Novak D.A. Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G743-G751PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G728-G737PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown recently that transfection of a full-length or truncated ecto-ATPase cDNA resulted in de novo synthesis of immunoreactive proteins by COS cells and their correct targeting to the plasma membrane, but only the full-length construct conferred on the cells the capacity to pump out taurocholate with efflux characteristics comparable to the potential-sensitive system defined in canalicular membrane vesicles (18Sippel C.J. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2083-2091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of cDNA and monospecific antibody probes for Ntcp and the ecto-ATPase/bile acid transporter now allows an in depth analysis of their development, including steady state mRNA and protein levels as well as rates of transcription. A complex pattern of regulation was found for both transport systems involving transcriptional, translational, and, for the basolateral transporter, possibly post-translational mechanisms. The sources of materials used were as follows. Reagents of analytical grade were purchased from Sigma, J. T. Baker, Inc. (Phillipsburg, NJ), and American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The cDNA for cyclophilin was kindly provided by William Pandak, Jr. (Medical College of Virginia), and the cDNA for α-fetoprotein was provided by Sanjay Gupta (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York). Male (200-250 g) and timed-pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Camm Laboratories (Wayne, NJ). Rats were housed at constant temperature (20°C) with alternating 12-h light-dark cycles and free access to standard rat chow and water. Livers from adult males were harvested after portal perfusion with ice-cold normal saline. Dams were anesthetized with 6% pentobarbital, and fetal livers (days 18, 20, and 21) were removed. Neonatal (day 1) and suckling (week 1, 2, 3, and 4) rats were killed by decapitation, prior to hepatectomy. Liver tissue was either used fresh or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C prior to use. Total RNA was made by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform extraction method(19Chromczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). mRNA was purified using biotinylated-oligo(dT) and streptavidin-labeled magnetic beads (Poly(A)Tract, Promega). Probes were labeled with 32P using a random-primed labeling method (Life Technologies, Inc.), and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by Sephadex G-50 chromatography. RNA blotting to nylon membrane (Genescreen, DuPont NEN) and hybridization with 32P cDNA probes were performed as previously described(20Sambrook K.J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The blots were washed sequentially as follows: 2 × SSC at room temperature, 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 60°C, 0.1 × SSC at room temperature, and exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette at room temperature and then X-OMAT film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70°C for 1-5 days. Cyclophilin, a constitutively expressed message, was used to correct for loading(21Pandak W.M. Vlahcevic Z.R. Chiang J.Y.L. Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. J. Lipid. Res. 1992; 33: 659-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ntcp probe was a 0.9-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)PIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. EcoRI fragment (nucleotides +261 to +1187) of the cDNA (6Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The ecto-ATPase probe was a 1.3-kb XbaI-PstI fragment (nucleotides −243 to +1093) of the cDNA(16Lin S.H. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14408-14414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclophilin probe was a full-length (743 base pairs) cDNA in pBI vector. Bands were quantitated by PhosphorImager using ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics) software according to instructions from the manufacturer. Membranes were also exposed to AR film (Kodak) for 1-3 days at −70°C. The results given at each age are the mean of three to five separate samples (each sample being made from a separate litter) and are corrected for loading using cyclophilin. kilobase(s) 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. Nuclei were made from fresh livers using a modification of the method described by Sasaki et al.(22Sasaki K. Cripe T.P. Koch S.R. Andreone T.L. Petersen D.D. Beale E.G. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15242-15251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Livers were weighed, suspended in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100), and homogenized using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer at 700 rpm for seven strokes. The homogenate was then filtered through two layers of gauze and centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 2.5 ml of homogenization buffer and layered on top of a sucrose cushion (3.1 M sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM HEPES, pH 6.8), After centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 80 min at 4°C, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in storage buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 40% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol) and counted using a methylene blue stain. Aliquots were stored at −70°C. Nuclear transcription reactions were carried out by the method of Diamond and Goodman (23Diamond D.L. Goodman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Nuclei (2 × 107) were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 3.5 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.05 M EDTA, 1 mM ATP, CTP, and GTP, and 100 μCi of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) in a final volume of 200 μl. Nuclei were treated sequentially with DNase I and proteinase K and extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol (25:24:1). The RNA was precipitated twice with sodium acetate and isopropanol. The pellet was washed twice with ethanol, resuspended in STE buffer (10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl), and passed through a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Boehringer Mannheim). Nascent RNA transcripts were hybridized to cDNAs immobilized on nylon filters (Genescreen, Dupont NEN). α-Fetoprotein was included as a positive control, as the transcription rate of this protein has been reported during the developmental period studied(24Shafritz D.A. Semin. Liv. Dis. 1988; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Linearized plasmid vector was included as a negative control. Ntcp cDNA was linearized with SacI, and ecto-ATPase and α-fetoprotein with PstI. Filters were prehybridized at 45°C for 24 h with 50% deionized formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 4 × SSC, 50 mM PIPES, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and yeast tRNA. Hybridization was carried out for 48 h at 45°C. The filters were then washed sequentially as follows: 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS twice for 20 min at 45°C; the same buffer with RNase A (20 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (700 units/ml) for 30 min at 37°C; 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65°C for 30 min three times; and 1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS for 30 min at 65°C. After rinsing in 2 × SSC, the filters were exposed in a PhosphorImager cassette for 3-7 days at room temperature and then to X-OMAT film (Kodak) at −70°C for 1 week. The bands were quantitated by PhosphorImager using ImageQuaNT software. Western analysis was performed on liver homogenates and purified basolateral membrane preparations (25Blitzer B.L. Donovan C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9295-9301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only liver homogenates were used for the ecto-ATPase studies because of the large number of animals that would be required to prepare canalicular membranes from fetal and neonatal animals. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Antibody to the basolateral bile acid transporter was made by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with a fusion protein comprising the C terminus (amino acids 309-357) of the transporter and schistosomal glutathione transferase(7Ananthanaryanan M. Ng O.C. Boyer J.L. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G637-G643PubMed Google Scholar). Specificity of this antibody was demonstrated on Western blots of basolateral membranes, using pre-immune sera, as well as by preabsorption of the sera with the fusion protein. Further, the ability of this antibody to detect Ntcp protein on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes was demonstrated by immunofluorescence(7Ananthanaryanan M. Ng O.C. Boyer J.L. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G637-G643PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody to the ecto-ATPase was made to a 100-kDa protein isolated from a bile acid affinity column and further purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(14Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G728-G737PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary antibody in each case was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (ICN). An enzyme chemiluminescent method was used for detection (ECL, Amersham Corp.) and quantitated by laser densitometry using an LKB Ultroscan XL densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Deglycosylation of Ntcp from 4-week-old and adult animals was carried out using highly purified basolateral membrane preparations (25Blitzer B.L. Donovan C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9295-9301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from these age groups with N-glycanase (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Briefly, basolateral membrane preparations were diluted in 0.5 M Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, with 0.5% SDS and 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. After denaturing, 7.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.3 units per 20 μg of protein of N-glycanase were added and incubated overnight at 37°C. After stopping the reaction, the proteins were analyzed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel in parallel with an undigested control, which was similarly incubated. To determine factors that contribute to age-related changes in bile acid transport activity across the basolateral and apical membranes of the hepatocyte, steady state mRNA levels for the basolateral sodium-dependent transporter (Ntcp) and canalicular bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase were determined at various stages of pre- and postnatal development by Northern analysis. These experiments were intended to determine whether the minimal transport activity during early life was due to a paucity of mRNA or inefficient translation of a relatively abundant message. The Ntcp probe hybridized to a single 1.7-kb message at each stage of development (Fig. 1A). Transcripts encoding Ntcp were not detectable by Northern analysis through most of gestation but were demonstrated at levels markedly below the adult just prior to birth. mRNA levels increased significantly between 1 and 7 days of life. Ntcp mRNA levels (Fig. 1B) were less than 20% of the adult prior to birth and increased to about 35% of the adult by the first postnatal day. By 1 week of age, adult levels were achieved and remained relatively constant thereafter. To determine how levels of specific mRNA correspond to relative transcription rates for the Ntcp gene, nuclear run-on assays were performed using nuclei isolated from fetal, neonatal, and adult liver. Transcription of the gene for α-fetoprotein, whose pattern of development has been well studied, was used for comparison. In these experiments, all RNAs undergoing transcription at the time of nuclear isolation are labeled and then hybridized with the Ntcp and control cDNA probes. Nuclear run-on assays (Fig. 2, A and B) showed that transcription of the Ntcp gene was low (5% of the adult) in the 21-day fetus. The rate of transcription increased almost 10-fold by the first day of life and approached adult levels by 1 week. In contrast, transcription of the α-fetoprotein gene was high in the fetus and neonate and fell to undetectable levels in the adult as previously reported(24Shafritz D.A. Semin. Liv. Dis. 1988; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows a representative Northern blot depicting canalicular bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase mRNA abundance during development. The probe recognizes a major 4.4-kb transcript (long form). The faint band at ~2.8 kb represents the short isoform, which parallels the long form during development as previously described by Cheung et al.(27Cheung P.H. Thompson N.L. Earley K. Culic O. Hixson D. Lin S-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6139-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady state mRNA levels for the transporter were low prior to birth and, similar to the Ntcp message, increased on the first day of life. Transcript levels (Fig. 3B) were approximately 12% of adult values prior to birth and 24% of the adult on the first day of life. There is a gradual increase during the suckling period to reach the levels of adult by 4 weeks of age. Transcription of bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase gene was also measured directly in several representative age groups using nuclear run-on assays (Fig. 4, A and B). A pattern similar to the transcription of the Ntcp gene was observed in that there was an increase in transcriptional activity as development proceeded. The rate of transcription was 9 and 30% of the adult rate by fetal day 21 and postnatal day 1, respectively. Adult rates of transcription were achieved by 7 days of age. It is well known that sodium-dependent bile acid transporter activity on the basolateral membrane and potential-dependent transport activity on the canalicular membrane are developmentally regulated. The Vmax for the sodium-dependent transporter is 23, 36, and 45% of adult values at 22 days fetal, 1 day, and 2 weeks of age, respectively. Mature function is not reached until 4 weeks postnatally(28Suchy F.J. Ballistreri W.F. Heubi J.E. Searcy J.E. Levin R.S. Gastroenterology. 1981; 80: 1037-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is an abrupt increase in the Vmax of potential-sensitive transporter to adult levels between 7 and 14 days postnatally(2Suchy F.J. Bucuvalas J.C. Goodrich A.L. Moyer M.S. Blitzer B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G665-G673PubMed Google Scholar, 3Novak D.A. Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G743-G751PubMed Google Scholar). Because the patterns of mRNA expression do not precisely mirror the observed developmental changes in activity of these transporters, age-related changes in the quantity or electrophoretic mobility of the basolateral and canalicular bile acid transport proteins was examined, using specific antibody detection of Western blots. Fig. 5A depicts a representative Western blot of liver homogenates prepared from rats of varying ages probed with antibody to the basolateral transporter. Immunoreactive protein was detectable at approximately 8% of the adult just prior to birth and increased dramatically to 82% of the adult level by the first postnatal day (Fig. 5B). The levels of the basolateral protein remained constant thereafter. Similar results were obtained on immunoblot analysis of liver basolateral membranes (Fig. 5C), indicating that the protein was not being synthesized and sequestered intracellularly during this period of development. However, the molecular mass of the protein detected in developing rat liver was only ~39 kDa compared to the 50-kDa protein observed on immunoblots of adult basolateral membranes. This difference persisted until at least 4 weeks of age. Since transport activity does not mature fully until about 4 weeks of age, a change in the electrophoretic mobility of the transport protein may be of functional importance. Several sites for N-linked glycosylation are present on examination of the Ntcp amino acid sequence(6Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Fig. 6shows the results of an experiment to further determine whether differences in glycosylation are responsible for age-related differences in the relative molecular mass of the protein. Deglycosylation of the transport protein in both the adult and 4-week-old animal was carried out enzymatically using N-glycanase. On deglycosylation, both proteins migrated at the same rate, suggesting that N-glycosylation is responsible for the difference in the apparent molecular weight of the proteins between developing and mature animals. The results of Western blot analysis of the canalicular bile acid transporter ecto-ATPase protein are shown in Fig. 7A. A protein of ~100 kDa was detected, and there was no apparent change in the electrophoretic mobility of protein during prenatal and postnatal development. The level of the protein, as measured by densitometry (Fig. 7B), was about 30% of the adult level in the 21-day-old fetus and increased approximately 2-fold by postnatal day 1. The canalicular protein reached adult levels by 7 days of age and remained unchanged thereafter. The level of protein correlated reasonably well with transport activity since we have previously shown that potential-dependent transport activity matures between 1 and 2 weeks of postnatal life (3Novak D.A. Sippel C.J. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G743-G751PubMed Google Scholar) and that the Vmax for ATP-dependent transport at 1 week is ~66% of the adult. 2M. Ananthanarayanan and F. J. Suchy, unpublished observations. The recent cloning of the cDNA for the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) and the availability of specific antibodies directed against the transporter have now allowed an in depth analysis of the mechanisms that underly the developmental regulation of the predominant hepatocyte uptake mechanism for bile acids. The pattern of regulation has proven to be considerably more complex than might have been predicted from the gradual increase in transport activity during development. Consistent with functional studies, transcripts encoding Ntcp were not detectable through most of gestation but were present at levels markedly below the adult just prior to birth. mRNA levels for the transporter increased to adult levels by 7 days of age even though transport activity, as estimated by Vmax, is only about 25% of the adult level at that time. Relative transcription rates for the Ntcp gene, as estimated by nuclear run-on assays, corresponded reasonably well to the amount of mRNA present at each developmental stage and also approached adult levels by 1 week. Thus, these data indicate that gene transcription rate is an important determinant in the maturation of the Ntcp transport system. Quantitation of Ntcp protein in basolateral membranes by Western blotting demonstrated an even more complex pattern of regulation. Immunoreactive Ntcp protein was found to be unexpectedly near adult levels shortly after birth. However, the molecular mass of the protein detected in basolateral membranes from developing rat liver was significantly less than that seen in mature liver (~39 versus 50 kDa). This difference persisted until at least 4 weeks of age. Further experiments showed that incomplete glycosylation was responsible for the age-related change in the molecular mass of the protein. In light of the demonstration of adult levels of Ntcp mRNA and protein concentrations in neonatal liver but deficient transport activity until after weaning, an immaturity of post-translational processing may explain the lower functional capacity of Ntcp during development. A similar discrepancy in the molecular mass has also been observed recently with the brush border membrane Na+/bile acid cotransporter of neonatal compared with adult rat ileum(29Shneider B.L. Dawson P.E. Chrisitie D.M. Hardikar W. Wong M.M. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This recently cloned polypeptide is similar in structure and function to Ntcp. Developmental changes in N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins in rat liver have been characterized (30Kato S. Oda-Tamai S. Akamatsu N. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and occur because enzymes involved in glycosylation of proteins, such as galactosyl transferase and sialyl transferase, themselves undergo ontogenic regulation(31Oda-tamai S. Kato S. Akamatsu N. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 32Oda-tamai S. Kato S. Akamatsu N. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Further, functionality of the carbohydrate moiety has been suggested for the sodium and chloride-coupled glycine transporter from pig brain stem(33Nunez E. Aragon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16920-16924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, incomplete glycosylation during development may represent a further level of regulation of the Ntcp in that its transport function may be altered, possibly by interference with its normal conformation within the basolateral membrane or its capacity to bind transported substrates. The pattern of ontogenic regulation for the canalicular bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase was also complex. Low rates of transcription and mRNA levels were present prior to birth. Although the adult rate of transcription for the gene was present by 7 days of age, a more gradual increase in the amount of bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase mRNA occurred during the suckling period to achieve adult levels by 4 weeks of age. These data suggest that transcripts encoding the bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase may be less stable during development. Western blot analysis of canalicular membranes showed bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase protein levels of about 30% of the adult in the 21-day-old fetus, which increased about 2-fold by the first postnatal day. Adult levels of the transporter were achieved by 7 days of age and remained constant. There was no apparent change in molecular weight during pre- and postnatal development. Although it is unclear whether the bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase is involved in the potential-dependent and/or ATP-dependent components of bile acid excretion, the adult levels of protein detected by 7 days correlated reasonably well with the maturation of both transport systems by 7-14 days postnatally. Factors other than glycosylation may be important in contributing to the developmental maturation of this transport system. For example, it has been demonstrated in transfection and site-directed mutagenesis studies that phosphorylation sites on the cytoplasmic tail of the bile acid transporter/ecto-ATPase are essential for transport activity(34Sippel C.J. Fallon R.J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19539-19545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Developmental change in the ability to phosphorylate this protein may be a critical determinant in achieving full transport capacity after the protein is expressed in the canalicular membrane. These studies point to the complexity of events during development leading to full transport capacity for bile acids across the basolateral and canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte. The different timing for the perinatal expression of carrier proteins and transport activities on these domains indicates that distinct arrays of transcription factors and post-transcriptional mechanisms may be required for the ontogenesis of each transport system. Transcriptional activation during the perinatal period plays a central role in regulating the mRNA abundance for both transporters; however, specific factors inducing expression of membrane transporters for bile acids have not yet been identified."

https://openalex.org/W2074255998,"We show that T7 RNA polymerase can efficiently transcribe DNA containing gaps from one to five bases in the template strand. Surprisingly, broken template strands missing up to 24 bases can still be transcribed, although at reduced efficiency. The resulting transcripts contain the full template sequence with the RNA deleted for the gapped region missing on the template strand. These findings indicate that the end of a downstream template strand can be brought into the polymerase and transcribed as if it were a part of an intact polynucleotide chain by utilizing the unpaired nontemplate strand. This, as well as transcription of an intact template strand, relies heavily upon the non-template strand, suggesting that a duplex DNA-binding site on the leading edge of RNA polymerase is required for RNA chain elongation on DNA templates. This work contributes substantially to the emerging picture that the nontemplate strand is an important element of the transcription elongation complex."
https://openalex.org/W2086823297,"Pycnodysostosis (OMIM 265800) is an autosomal recessive skeletal disorder first described by Maroteaux and Lamy that is characterized by short stature, increased bone density, delayed closure of cranial sutures, loss of the mandibular angle, dysplastic clavicles, dissolution of the terminal phalanges of the hands and feet, dental abnormalities and increased bone fragility. Patients have a typical appearance secondary to prominence of the calvarium, smallness of the facial features, prominent nose and micrognathia. The French painter, Henri de Toulouse Lautrec (1864-1901), is believed to have had the disorder. Although more than 100 cases have been reported, we are aware of only two large consanguinous pedigrees in which the pycnodysostosis disorder segregates. We have studied the segregation of the pycnodysostosis phenotype in a large consanguinous Mexican pedigree, the clinical features of which are very similar to those described in the Arab pedigree studied by Edelson et al. Here, we report linkage for the pycnodysostosis phenotype in the 1cen-q21 region of human chromosome 1, and discuss candidate genes for this skeletal disorder."

https://openalex.org/W2051715946,"The spinach triose phosphate/phosphate translocator and the 37-kDa protein are both integral components of the chloroplast inner envelope membrane. They are synthesized in the cytosol with N-terminal extensions, the transit peptides, that are different in structural terms from those of imported stromal or thylakoid proteins. In order to determine if these N-terminal extensions are essential for the correct localization to the envelope membrane, they were linked to the mature parts of thylakoid membrane proteins, the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein and the CF0II-subunit of the thylakoid ATP synthase, respectively. In addition, the transit peptide of the CF0II-subunit that contains signals for the transport across both the envelope and the thylakoid membrane was fused to the mature parts of both envelope membrane proteins. The chimeric proteins were imported into isolated spinach chloroplasts, and the intraorganellar routing of the proteins was analyzed. The results obtained show that the N-terminal extensions of both envelope membrane proteins possess a stroma-targeting function only and that the information for the integration into the envelope membrane is contained in the mature parts of the proteins. At least part of the integration signal is provided by hydrophobic domains in the mature sequences since the removal of such a hydrophobic segment from the 37-kDa protein leads to missorting of the protein to the stroma and the thylakoid membrane. The spinach triose phosphate/phosphate translocator and the 37-kDa protein are both integral components of the chloroplast inner envelope membrane. They are synthesized in the cytosol with N-terminal extensions, the transit peptides, that are different in structural terms from those of imported stromal or thylakoid proteins. In order to determine if these N-terminal extensions are essential for the correct localization to the envelope membrane, they were linked to the mature parts of thylakoid membrane proteins, the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein and the CF0II-subunit of the thylakoid ATP synthase, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2048710542,"To determine the role of Gly-1 and Lys-2 of bovine γB-crystallin in glycation and cross-linking, Lys-2 was changed to Thr by site-directed mutagenesis. A polymerase chain reaction was used to perform site-directed mutagenesis on the third codon (AAG → ACG) of bovine γB-crystallin cDNA. The wild type and mutant cDNAs were cloned into pMON5743 and expressed in JM101 Escherichia coli cells, and the identity of γB-crystallin was confirmed by Western blotting after purification by cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography. Glycation of γB-crystallin by [14C]glucose was reduced significantly due to the mutation of Lys-2, supporting the view that Lys-2 is a major glycation site. Peptide mapping showed the presence of two major labeled peptides containing N-terminal sequences, and in the mutant these peptides had longer retention times and reduced radioactivity. Amino acid analysis, after glycation with [14C]glucose, revealed N-terminal glycine as the most predominant glycation site. Lys-2 was glycated slower than Gly-1 but faster than Lys-163. Glycation with DL-glyceraldehyde showed an important role for both Gly-1 and Lys-2 in the glycation-mediated γB-crystallin cross-linking."
