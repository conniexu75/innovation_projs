https://openalex.org/W4282556362,"COVID survivors frequently experience lingering neurological symptoms that resemble cancer-therapy-related cognitive impairment, a syndrome for which white matter microglial reactivity and consequent neural dysregulation is central. Here, we explored the neurobiological effects of respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection and found white-matter-selective microglial reactivity in mice and humans. Following mild respiratory COVID in mice, persistently impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, decreased oligodendrocytes, and myelin loss were evident together with elevated CSF cytokines/chemokines including CCL11. Systemic CCL11 administration specifically caused hippocampal microglial reactivity and impaired neurogenesis. Concordantly, humans with lasting cognitive symptoms post-COVID exhibit elevated CCL11 levels. Compared with SARS-CoV-2, mild respiratory influenza in mice caused similar patterns of white-matter-selective microglial reactivity, oligodendrocyte loss, impaired neurogenesis, and elevated CCL11 at early time points, but after influenza, only elevated CCL11 and hippocampal pathology persisted. These findings illustrate similar neuropathophysiology after cancer therapy and respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection which may contribute to cognitive impairment following even mild COVID."
https://openalex.org/W4283745152,"Ageing is intimately connected to the induction of cell senescence1,2, but why this is so remains poorly understood. A key challenge is the identification of pathways that normally suppress senescence, are lost during ageing and are functionally relevant to oppose ageing3. Here we connected the structural and functional decline of ageing tissues to attenuated function of the master effectors of cellular mechanosignalling YAP and TAZ. YAP/TAZ activity declines during physiological ageing in stromal cells, and mimicking such decline through genetic inactivation of YAP/TAZ in these cells leads to accelerated ageing. Conversely, sustaining YAP function rejuvenates old cells and opposes the emergence of ageing-related traits associated with either physiological ageing or accelerated ageing triggered by a mechano-defective extracellular matrix. Ageing traits induced by inactivation of YAP/TAZ are preceded by induction of tissue senescence. This occurs because YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction suppresses cGAS–STING signalling, to the extent that inhibition of STING prevents tissue senescence and premature ageing-related tissue degeneration after YAP/TAZ inactivation. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ-mediated control of cGAS–STING signalling relies on the unexpected role of YAP/TAZ in preserving nuclear envelope integrity, at least in part through direct transcriptional regulation of lamin B1 and ACTR2, the latter of which is involved in building the peri-nuclear actin cap. The findings demonstrate that declining YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction drives ageing by unleashing cGAS–STING signalling, a pillar of innate immunity. Thus, sustaining YAP/TAZ mechanosignalling or inhibiting STING may represent promising approaches for limiting senescence-associated inflammation and improving healthy ageing."
https://openalex.org/W4283751730,"Auxins are hormones that have central roles and control nearly all aspects of growth and development in plants1-3. The proteins in the PIN-FORMED (PIN) family (also known as the auxin efflux carrier family) are key participants in this process and control auxin export from the cytosol to the extracellular space4-9. Owing to a lack of structural and biochemical data, the molecular mechanism of PIN-mediated auxin transport is not understood. Here we present biophysical analysis together with three structures of Arabidopsis thaliana PIN8: two outward-facing conformations with and without auxin, and one inward-facing conformation bound to the herbicide naphthylphthalamic acid. The structure forms a homodimer, with each monomer divided into a transport and scaffold domain with a clearly defined auxin binding site. Next to the binding site, a proline-proline crossover is a pivot point for structural changes associated with transport, which we show to be independent of proton and ion gradients and probably driven by the negative charge of the auxin. The structures and biochemical data reveal an elevator-type transport mechanism reminiscent of bile acid/sodium symporters, bicarbonate/sodium symporters and sodium/proton antiporters. Our results provide a comprehensive molecular model for auxin recognition and transport by PINs, link and expand on a well-known conceptual framework for transport, and explain a central mechanism of polar auxin transport, a core feature of plant physiology, growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W4283693076,"Injured neurons in the adult mammalian central nervous system often die and seldom regenerate axons. To uncover transcriptional pathways that could ameliorate these disappointing responses, we analyzed three interventions that increase survival and regeneration of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following optic nerve crush (ONC) injury, albeit not to a clinically useful extent. We assessed gene expression in each of 46 RGC types by single-cell transcriptomics following ONC and treatment. We also compared RGCs that regenerated with those that survived but did not regenerate. Each intervention enhanced survival of most RGC types, but type-independent axon regeneration required manipulation of multiple pathways. Distinct computational methods converged on separate sets of genes selectively expressed by RGCs likely to be dying, surviving, or regenerating. Overexpression of genes associated with the regeneration program enhanced both survival and axon regeneration in vivo, indicating that mechanistic analysis can be used to identify novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4283703099,"Regulatory programs governing neuronal death and axon regeneration in neurodegenerative diseases remain poorly understood. In adult mice, optic nerve crush (ONC) injury by severing retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons results in massive RGC death and regenerative failure. We performed an in vivo CRISPR-Cas9-based genome-wide screen of 1,893 transcription factors (TFs) to seek repressors of RGC survival and axon regeneration following ONC. In parallel, we profiled the epigenetic and transcriptional landscapes of injured RGCs by ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to identify injury-responsive TFs and their targets. These analyses converged on four TFs as critical survival regulators, of which ATF3/CHOP preferentially regulate pathways activated by cytokines and innate immunity and ATF4/C/EBPγ regulate pathways engaged by intrinsic neuronal stressors. Manipulation of these TFs protects RGCs in a glaucoma model. Our results reveal core transcription programs that transform an initial axonal insult into a degenerative process and suggest novel strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4283753475,"Single-aperture cavities are a key component of lasers that are instrumental for the amplification and emission of a single light mode. However, the appearance of high-order transverse modes as the size of the cavities increases has frustrated efforts to scale-up cavities while preserving single-mode operation since the invention of the laser six decades ago1-8. A suitable physical mechanism that allows single-mode lasing irrespective of the cavity size-a 'scale invariant' cavity or laser-has not been identified yet. Here we propose and demonstrate experimentally that open-Dirac electromagnetic cavities with linear dispersion-which in our devices are realized by a truncated photonic crystal arranged in a hexagonal pattern-exhibit unconventional scaling of losses in reciprocal space, leading to single-mode lasing that is maintained as the cavity is scaled up in size. The physical origin of this phenomenon lies in the convergence of the complex part of the free spectral range in open-Dirac cavities towards a constant governed by the loss rates of distinct Bloch bands, whereas for common cavities it converges to zero as the size grows, leading to inevitable multimode emission. An unconventional flat-envelope fundamental mode locks all unit cells in the cavity in phase, leading to single-mode lasing. We name such sources Berkeley surface-emitting lasers (BerkSELs) and demonstrate that their far-field corresponds to a topological singularity of charge two, in agreement with our theory. Open-Dirac cavities unlock avenues for light-matter interaction and cavity quantum electrodynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4283516015,"The ring-forming AAA+ hexamer ClpC1 associates with the peptidase ClpP1P2 to form a central ATP-driven protease in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). ClpC1 is essential for Mtb viability and has been identified as the target of antibacterial peptides like CyclomarinA (CymA) that exhibit strong toxicity toward Mtb. The mechanistic actions of these drugs are poorly understood. Here, we dissected how ClpC1 activity is controlled and how this control is deregulated by CymA. We show that ClpC1 exists in diverse activity states correlating with its assembly. The basal activity of ClpC1 is low, as it predominantly exists in an inactive nonhexameric resting state. We show that CymA stimulates ClpC1 activity by promoting formation of supercomplexes composed of multiple ClpC1 hexameric rings, enhancing ClpC1-ClpP1P2 degradation activity toward various substrates. Both the ClpC1 resting state and the CymA-induced alternative assembly state rely on interactions between the ClpC1 coiled-coil middle domains (MDs). Accordingly, we found that mutation of the conserved aromatic F444 residue located at the MD tip blocks MD interactions and prevents assembly into higher order complexes, thereby leading to constitutive ClpC1 hexamer formation. We demonstrate that this assembly state exhibits the highest ATPase and proteolytic activities, yet its heterologous expression in Escherichia coli is toxic, indicating that the formation of such a state must be tightly controlled. Taken together, these findings define the basis of control of ClpC1 activity and show how ClpC1 overactivation by an antibacterial drug generates toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W4283749709,"In flies, Argonaute2 (Ago2) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) form an RNA-induced silencing complex to repress viral transcripts1. The RNase III enzyme Dicer-2 associates with its partner protein R2D2 and cleaves long double-stranded RNAs to produce 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes, which are then loaded into Ago2 in a defined orientation2-5. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Dicer-2-R2D2 and Dicer-2-R2D2-siRNA complexes. R2D2 interacts with the helicase domain and the central linker of Dicer-2 to inhibit the promiscuous processing of microRNA precursors by Dicer-2. Notably, our structure represents the strand-selection state in the siRNA-loading process, and reveals that R2D2 asymmetrically recognizes the end of the siRNA duplex with the higher base-pairing stability, and the other end is exposed to the solvent and is accessible by Ago2. Our findings explain how R2D2 senses the thermodynamic asymmetry of the siRNA and facilitates the siRNA loading into Ago2 in a defined orientation, thereby determining which strand of the siRNA duplex is used by Ago2 as the guide strand for target silencing."
https://openalex.org/W4283705975,"COVID-19 infection is normally followed by several post-COVID effects. This study aimed to investigate to evaluate menstrual changes in females following COVID-19 infection, and to evaluate female perception about the effect of COVID-19 on their menstrual cycles.During this cross-sectional survey-based study, a convenience sample of 483 women from Jordan and from Iraq, who had infected with COVID-19 were invited to fill-out the study questionnaire.The study was conducted on the females, with a median age 31 years old. Results showed that 47.2% of them (n = 228) suffered from a change in the number of days between two consecutive periods, as well as from a change in the amount of blood loss. Also, more than 50% of them believed that COVID-19 infection may cause changes in the amount of blood loss during the cycle (n = 375, 56.9%), and changes in the number of days between the two consecutive periods (n = 362, 54.2%). Regression analysis showed that participants with higher educational level (bachelor or higher) (Beta = -0.114, P = 0.011), and those living in Iraq (Beta = -0.166, P<0.001) believed that COVID-19 has lower tendency to cause menstrual changes. In addition, non-married females (Beta = 0.109, P = 0.017), and those who are current smokers (Beta = 0.091, P = 0.048) believed that COVID-19 has higher tendency to cause menstrual changes.his study revealed that COVID-19 infection could affect the menstrual cycle for the females. Further prospective studies should be done to confirm these findings and evaluate how long these menstrual irregularities lasted."
https://openalex.org/W4282973130,"Acute mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a more chronic cognitive syndrome known as “COVID fog.” New findings from Fernández-Castañeda et al. reveal how glial dysregulation and consequent neural circuit dysfunction may contribute to cognitive impairments in long COVID. Acute mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a more chronic cognitive syndrome known as “COVID fog.” New findings from Fernández-Castañeda et al. reveal how glial dysregulation and consequent neural circuit dysfunction may contribute to cognitive impairments in long COVID. More than 2 years since the first detected cases of COVID-19, the virus continues to evolve new variants, infect hundreds of millions of people, and pose both acute and chronic threats to global health. In most infections, a patient’s symptoms resolve within 2 weeks. However, recovery from initial infection is not always straightforward. In a significant fraction of patients, symptoms can persist for several months. This syndrome, which has become known as “long COVID,” may occur even following initially mild cases (that is, those not requiring hospitalization) and can include significant cognitive dysfunction. Initial awareness of long COVID emerged from anecdotal accounts, shared by patients on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Slack (Callard and Perego, 2021Callard F. Perego E. How and why patients made Long Covid.Soc. Sci. Med. 2021; 268: 113426https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113426Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Since then, a large number of studies have used more formal methods to catalog the nature and frequency of long COVID symptoms. Within the cognitive domain, as many as one in four patients experience a range of symptoms that have become known colloquially as “COVID fog,” which includes problems in attention, language fluency, processing speed, executive function, and memory (Becker et al., 2021Becker J.H. Lin J.J. Doernberg M. Stone K. Navis A. Festa J.R. Wisnivesky J.P. Assessment of Cognitive Function in Patients After COVID-19 Infection.JAMA Netw. Open. 2021; 4e2130645https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.30645Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Given the sheer scale of infections, there is a pressing need to understand how cognitive dysfunction emerges in long COVID. In this issue of Cell, a new paper by Fernández-Castañeda and colleagues (Fernández-Castañeda et al., 2022Fernández-Castañeda A. Lu P. Geraghty A.C. Song E. Lee M.-H. Wood J. O’Dea M.R. Dutton S.

Using mice as a model, they expressed human ACE2, the viral entry receptor required for successful COVID infection. Because ACE2 expression was restricted to the trachea and lungs, these mice developed only a mild form of the disease that was limited to the respiratory system and largely cleared within a week following intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 virus. As a starting point, the researchers noted the striking similarities between COVID fog and another cognitive syndrome known as “chemobrain.” Chemobrain (or cancer-therapy-related cognitive impairment, CRCI), is a neuroinflammatory condition that patients often experience following radiation or chemotherapy. In CRCI, elevations in neurotoxic cytokines and reactive microglia (brain-resident macrophages) lead to cascades of multicellular events that impact forms of both gray and white matter plasticity that are important for healthy cognition (Gibson and Monje, 2021Gibson E.M. Monje M. Microglia in Cancer Therapy-Related Cognitive Impairment.Trends Neurosci. 2021; 44: 441-451https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2021.02.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Adopting this framework, the authors quantified changes in cytokines and microglial/macrophage reactivity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reminiscent of CRCI, they found that microglial/macrophage reactivity was elevated in subcortical and hippocampal white matter in mice following mild respiratory COVID. Remarkably, this elevation was persistent and still evident even 7 weeks post infection. Outside of the brain, they detected elevated cytokine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum of mice. Although levels of many cytokines were altered, one in particular grabbed their attention. CCL11 remained persistently elevated in mouse cerebrospinal fluid 7 weeks post infection. Notably, elevated CCL11 levels have been causally linked to cognitive impairments observed in normal aging (Villeda et al., 2011Villeda S.A. Luo J. Mosher K.I. Zou B. Britschgi M. Bieri G. Stan T.M. Fainberg N. Ding Z. Eggel A. et al.The ageing systemic milieu negatively regulates neurogenesis and cognitive function.Nature. 2011; 477: 90-94https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Similar patterns were found in patients with COVID-19 (Figure 1). Reactive microglia were elevated in subcortical white matter in individuals with COVID-19 (these patients were symptomatic for COVID-19 but died from other causes). Moreover, CCL11 was elevated in plasma from patients with long COVID. Remarkably, elevated CCL11 plasma levels were only detected in those long COVID patients with cognitive symptoms. CCL11 plasma levels were unaltered in long COVID patients who did not have cognitive symptoms. These findings suggest that CCL11 plays a central role in the brain pathology contributing to COVID fog. There are several ways in which such a neuroinflammatory state might impact cognition. Previous work has shown that persistently reactive microglia in hippocampal white matter suppress hippocampal neurogenesis by blocking neuronal progenitor-cell differentiation into new granule cells (Monje et al., 2003Monje M.L. Toda H. Palmer T.D. Inflammatory blockade restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis.Science. 2003; 302: 1760-1765https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1088417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). These newly generated neurons are important for the formation and stability of hippocampus-dependent memories. The authors found the numbers of new neurons were reduced in infected mice, and this reduction correlated with numbers of reactive microglia in the hippocampus. Remarkably, systemic administration of CCL11 recapitulated this same pattern in uninfected mice. Increased numbers of reactive microglia and decreased numbers of new neurons in these mice suggest a causal role for CCL11 in COVID fog pathology. These CCL11-induced outcomes were restricted to the hippocampus, suggesting that particular cytokines can have circuit-specific effects. Another way in which CCL11 and/or reactive microglia might impact cognition is via effects on white matter. In CRCI, reactive microglia impair the formation of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes and myelin plasticity (Geraghty et al., 2019Geraghty A.C. Gibson E.M. Ghanem R.A. Greene J.J. Ocampo A. Goldstein A.K. Ni L. Yang T. Marton R.M. Pasca S.P. et al.Loss of Adaptive Myelination Contributes to Methotrexate Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment.Neuron. 2019; 103: 250-265.e8https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.04.032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar; Gibson et al., 2019Gibson E.M.

Similarly, the authors found reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes and their precursor cells, as well as decreased axon myelination in the subcortical white matter, several weeks following infection in mice. Although behavior was not assessed in this study, it is nonetheless reasonable to assume that such changes would alter cognitive function following mild respiratory COVID in mice, as it does in other disease contexts (Geraghty et al., 2019Geraghty A.C. Gibson E.M. Ghanem R.A. Greene J.J. Ocampo A. Goldstein A.K. Ni L. Yang T. Marton R.M. Pasca S.P. et al.Loss of Adaptive Myelination Contributes to Methotrexate Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment.Neuron. 2019; 103: 250-265.e8https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.04.032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar; Gibson et al., 2019Gibson E.M.

Since myelination regulates the speed and timing of communication between neurons, dysregulation of oligodendoglial lineage cells following infection might slow neural processing, disrupt brain synchrony, and impair cognition (Steadman et al., 2020Steadman P.E. Xia F. Ahmed M. Mocle A.J. Penning A.R.A. Geraghty A.C. Steenland H.W. Monje M. Josselyn S.A. Frankland P.W.

The principle that inflammatory challenges may induce glial dysregulation and consequent neural circuit dysfunction is not specific to COVID-19. Many systemic infections are associated with lasting cognitive impairments. For instance, similar to COVID-19, the Spanish flu of 1918 (caused by H1N1 influenza virus infection) was associated with brain fog. In the current study, the authors compared the effects of mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection with a mouse model of mild respiratory H1N1 influenza. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection, they found persistently elevated CCL11 in the H1N1 influenza infection. Therefore, CCL11-driven neuroinflammatory changes and cellular deficits may represent a common pathway to cognitive deficits in both mild respiratory COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza disease (as well as perhaps in other contexts, including aging). However, different systemic infections can also have non-overlapping outcomes. For instance, whereas risk for anxiety and depression appears to be elevated in COVID-19, Spanish flu was associated with increased prevalence of psychosis (Honigsbaum, 2013Honigsbaum M. “An inexpressible dread”: psychoses of influenza at fin-de-siecle.Lancet. 2013; 381: 988-989https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(13)60701-1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What accounts for these differences? One clue emerges from the current study. While CCL11 was elevated following SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 influenza infection, a subset of cytokines was differentially regulated in these two conditions. It is likely that these non-overlapping cytokines (and their potentially non-overlapping circuit effects) might differentiate these diseases in terms of elevated risks for particular neuropsychiatric outcomes. If cytokines have circuit-specific effects, should we consider cytokine profiling as a way to inform our treatment strategies for viral-induced/non-viral induced cognitive syndromes? Future research will no doubt address this and other outstanding questions. For instance, how are these effects mitigated by vaccination, administered before or after infection? And, perhaps most significantly, might interventions that block inducers of these cytokines or reset reactive microglia prove useful in treating COVID fog? The authors declare no competing interests.

https://openalex.org/W4283712317,"Music is a vital part of most cultures and has a strong impact on emotions [1–5]. In Western cultures, emotive valence is strongly influenced by major and minor melodies and harmony (chords and their progressions) [6–13]. Yet, how pitch and harmony affect our emotions, and to what extent these effects are culturally mediated or universal, is hotly debated [2, 5, 14–20]. Here, we report an experiment conducted in a remote cloud forest region of Papua New Guinea, across several communities with similar traditional music but differing levels of exposure to Western-influenced tonal music. One hundred and seventy participants were presented with pairs of major and minor cadences (chord progressions) and melodies, and chose which of them made them happier. The experiment was repeated by 60 non-musicians and 19 musicians in Sydney, Australia. Bayesian analyses show that, for cadences, there is strong evidence that greater happiness was reported for major than minor in every community except one: the community with minimal exposure to Western-like music. For melodies, there is strong evidence that greater happiness was reported for those with higher mean pitch (major melodies) than those with lower mean pitch (minor melodies) in only one of the three PNG communities and in both Sydney groups. The results show that the emotive valence of major and minor is strongly associated with exposure to Western-influenced music and culture, although we cannot exclude the possibility of universality."
https://openalex.org/W4283750693,"Abstract The RAS–RAF pathway is one of the most commonly dysregulated in human cancers 1–3 . Despite decades of study, understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying dimerization and activation 4 of the kinase RAF remains limited. Recent structures of inactive RAF monomer 5 and active RAF dimer 5–8 bound to 14-3-3 9,10 have revealed the mechanisms by which 14-3-3 stabilizes both RAF conformations via specific phosphoserine residues. Prior to RAF dimerization, the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1C) must dephosphorylate the N-terminal phosphoserine (NTpS) of RAF 11 to relieve inhibition by 14-3-3, although PP1C in isolation lacks intrinsic substrate selectivity. SHOC2 is as an essential scaffolding protein that engages both PP1C and RAS to dephosphorylate RAF NTpS 11–13 , but the structure of SHOC2 and the architecture of the presumptive SHOC2–PP1C–RAS complex remain unknown. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SHOC2–PP1C–MRAS complex to an overall resolution of 3 Å, revealing a tripartite molecular architecture in which a crescent-shaped SHOC2 acts as a cradle and brings together PP1C and MRAS. Our work demonstrates the GTP dependence of multiple RAS isoforms for complex formation, delineates the RAS-isoform preference for complex assembly, and uncovers how the SHOC2 scaffold and RAS collectively drive specificity of PP1C for RAF NTpS. Our data indicate that disease-relevant mutations affect complex assembly, reveal the simultaneous requirement of two RAS molecules for RAF activation, and establish rational avenues for discovery of new classes of inhibitors to target this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4285741326,"Aging-induced memory impairment is closely associated with oxidative stress. D-Galactose (D-gal) evokes severe oxidative stress and mimics normal aging in animals. Curcumin, a natural flavonoid, has potent antioxidant and anti-aging properties. There are several proteins like glutathione S-transferase A1 (GSTA1), glutathione S-transferase omega-1 (GSTO1), kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and amine oxidase [flavin-containing] A (MAOA) are commonly involved in oxidative stress and aging. This study aimed to investigate the interaction of curcumin to these proteins and their subsequent effect on aging-associated memory impairment in two robust animal models: D-Gal and normal aged (NA) mice. The aging mice model was developed by administering D-gal intraperitoneally (i.p). Mice (n = 64) were divided into the eight groups (8 mice in each group): Vehicle, Curcumin-Control, D-gal (100mg/kg; i.p), Curcumin + D-gal, Astaxanthin (Ast) + D-gal, Normal Aged (NA), Curcumin (30mg/kg Orally) + NA, Ast (20mg/kg Orally) + NA. Retention and freezing memories were assessed by passive avoidance (PA) and contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Molecular docking was performed to predict curcumin binding with potential molecular targets. Curcumin significantly increased retention time (p &lt; 0.05) and freezing response (p &lt; 0.05) in PA and CFC, respectively. Curcumin profoundly ameliorated the levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, advanced oxidation protein products, nitric oxide, and lipid peroxidation in mice hippocampi. In silico studies revealed favorable binding energies of curcumin with GSTA1, GSTO1, KEAP1, BACE1, and MAOA. Curcumin improves retention and freezing memory in D-gal and nature-induced aging mice. Curcumin ameliorates the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers in mice. Anti-aging effects of curcumin could be attributed to, at least partially, the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes through binding with GSTA1, GSTO1, KEAP1, and inhibition of oxidative damage through binding with BACE1 and MAOA."
https://openalex.org/W4285413830,"Background Skilled birth attendants (SBAs) play a crucial role in reducing infant and maternal mortality. Although the ratio of skilled assistance at birth has increased in Bangladesh, factors associated with SBA use are unknown. The main goal of our study was to reveal the individual- and community-level factors associated with SBA use during childbirth in Bangladesh. We also showed the prevalence and trend of SBA use and related independent variables in Bangladesh over the past decade. Methods This study utilized the Bangladesh Health and Demographic Survey (BDHS) 2017–2018, a cross-sectional study. We used binary logistic regression to examine the extent of variation in SBA use attributable to the individual- and community-level variables. Results Overall, 53.35% of women received assistance from SBAs during childbirth. The average annual rate of increase (AARI) in the number of SBA-assisted births over the past 10 years was 8.88%. Respondents who gave birth at or above 19 years had 1.40 times (AOR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.21–1.62) greater odds of having skilled delivery assistance than respondents aged 18 years old or less. Women and their husband’s education levels were significantly associated with using skilled assistance during delivery, with odds of 1.60 (AOR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.45–2.01) and 1.41 (AOR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.21–1.66), respectively compared to those with education up to primary level. Women from rich families and those receiving better antenatal care (ANC) visits were more likely to have professional delivery assistance. Community-level factors also showed significance towards having professional assistance while giving birth. Women from urban communities and those who utilized more than four ANC visits and had completed secondary or higher education showed a greater tendency to use an SBA during childbirth than their counterparts. Conclusion The use of SBAs during delivery was significantly associated with some individual- and community-level factors. To reduce maternal and child mortality, there is a need to focus on rural and uneducated people who are less likely to access these facilities. Special programs could increase awareness and help the poor community obtain the minimum facility in maternal care."
https://openalex.org/W4285613771,"Most research on the effect of leadership behavior on employees' well-being and organizational outcomes is based on leadership frameworks that are not rooted in sound psychological theories of motivation and are limited to either an individual or organizational levels of analysis. The current paper investigates whether individual and team resources explain the impact of engaging leadership on work engagement and team effectiveness, respectively. Data were collected at two time points on N = 1,048 employees nested within 90 work teams. The Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling results revealed that personal resources (i.e., optimism, resiliency, self-efficacy, and flexibility) partially mediated the impact of T1 individual perceptions of engaging leadership on T2 work engagement. Furthermore, joint perceptions of engaging leadership among team members at T1 resulted in greater team effectiveness at T2. This association was fully mediated by team resources (i.e., performance feedback, trust in management, communication, and participation in decision-making). Moreover, team resources had a significant cross-level effect on individual levels of engagement. In practical terms, training and supporting leaders who inspire, strengthen, and connect their subordinates could significantly improve employees' motivation and involvement and enable teams to pursue their common goals successfully."
https://openalex.org/W3208974899,"There is uncertainty around the health impact and economic costs of the recent slowing of the historical decline in cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and the future impact on dementia and disability.Previously validated IMPACT Better Ageing Markov model for England and Wales, integrating English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) data for 17,906 ELSA participants followed from 1998 to 2012, linked to NHS Hospital Episode Statistics. Counterfactual design comparing two scenarios: Scenario 1. CVD Plateau-age-specific CVD incidence remains at 2011 levels, thus continuing recent trends. Scenario 2. CVD Fall-age-specific CVD incidence goes on declining, following longer-term trends. The main outcome measures were age-related healthcare costs, social care costs, opportunity costs of informal care, and quality adjusted life years (valued at £60,000 per QALY).The total 10 year cumulative incremental net monetary cost associated with a persistent plateauing of CVD would be approximately £54 billion (95% uncertainty interval £14.3-£96.2 billion), made up of some £13 billion (£8.8-£16.7 billion) healthcare costs, £1.5 billion (-£0.9-£4.0 billion) social care costs, £8 billion (£3.4-£12.8 billion) informal care and £32 billion (£0.3-£67.6 billion) value of lost QALYs.After previous, dramatic falls, CVD incidence has recently plateaued. That slowdown could substantially increase health and social care costs over the next ten years. Healthcare costs are likely to increase more than social care costs in absolute terms, but social care costs will increase more in relative terms. Given the links between COVID-19 and cardiovascular health, effective cardiovascular prevention policies need to be revitalised urgently."
https://openalex.org/W4285505559,"Large-scale deworming programs have been successful in reducing the burden of disease due to soil-transmitted helminth (STH; Ascaris lumbricloides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm) infections, but re-infection in absence of other measures is unavoidable. We assessed the role of nail contamination as a source of infection with the goal to evaluate the potential of nail clipping as a simple measure to further reduce STH-attributable morbidity.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Jimma Town (Ethiopia). Both stool samples and clipped nails were collected from 600 schoolchildren and microscopically screened for the presence of STHs. We also interviewed the children to gain insights into their hygiene practices. Subsequently, we explored any associations between infection, nail contamination and personal hygiene.Any STH infections were observed in 24.3% of the children (A. lumbricoides: 18.5%; T. trichiura: 9.8%; hookworm: 0.5%). The intensity of the infections was mainly low, only in a few cases a moderate-to-heavy intensity infection was observed (A. lumbricoides: 4.3%; T. trichiura: 0.2%). Other helminth species observed were Schistosoma mansoni (5.0%), Hymenolepis nana (2.7%), Taenia spp. and Enterobius vermicularis (<1.0%). The analysis of the nail material revealed the presence of A. lumbricoides (1.7%), Taenia spp. (1.0%), T. trichiura (0.5%), E. vermicularis (0.5%) and H. nana (0.2%). The odds of infection with any STH increased as the frequency of trimming decreased. The odds of nail contamination with any STH and A. lumbricoides were higher for younger children.The presence of helminth eggs under the nails of children highlights a poor personal hygiene. The association between any STH infection and frequency of nail trimming needs to be explored in an intervention study. The recent prevalence of any STH infections indicated that scaling down of the frequency of deworming is justified but that STH is still a public health problem."
https://openalex.org/W4285506646,"The study purpose was to assess, in a U.S. probability sample of women, the specific ways women have discovered to experience pleasure from anal touch. Through qualitative pilot research with women that informed the development of the survey instrument used in this study, we identified three previously unnamed, but distinct, anal touch techniques that many women find pleasurable and that expand the anal sexual repertoire beyond the more commonly studied anal intercourse behaviors: Anal Surfacing, Anal Shallowing, and Anal Pairing. This study defines each technique and describes its prevalence among U.S. adult women. Weighted frequencies were drawn from the Second OMGYES Pleasure Report—a cross-sectional, online, national probability survey of 3017 American women’s (age 18–93) sexual experiences and discoveries. Participants were recruited via the Ipsos KnowledgePanel ® . Data suggest that 40% of women find ‘Anal Surfacing’ pleasurable: sexual touch by a finger, penis, or sex toy on and around the anus. Approximately 35% of women have experienced pleasure using ‘Anal Shallowing’: penetrative touch by a finger, penis, or sex toy just inside the anal opening, no deeper than a fingertip/knuckle. Finally, 40% of women make other forms of sexual touch more pleasurable using ‘Anal Pairing’: touch on or inside the anus that happens at the same time as other kinds of sexual touch such as vaginal penetration or clitoral touching. These data provide techniques that women can and do use to explore the anus as a pleasurable region for touch—which can enable women to better identify their own preferences, communicate about them and advocate for their sexual pleasure."
https://openalex.org/W4283688265,"Abnormalities in the mitochondria have been linked to psoriasis, a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is present in thousands of copies per cell and altered mtDNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), a common indicator of mitochondrial function, has been proposed as a biomarker for several diseases including autoimmune diseases. In this case-control study, we investigated whether the mtDNA-CN is related to psoriasis, correlates with the disease duration and severity, and can serve as a disease biomarker. Relative mtDNA-CN as compared with nuclear DNA was measured by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood buffy coat samples from 56 patients with psoriasis and 44 healthy controls. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the value of mtDNA-CN as a biomarker. We found that the mtDNA-CN was significantly decreased in patients with psoriasis compared to healthy controls (93.6±5.3 vs. 205±71; P = 0.04). Sub-group analyses with stratification of patients based on disease duration under or over 10 years and disease severity indicated that the mtDNA-CN was significantly lower in patients with longer disease duration (74±4.3 in disease duration >10 years vs. 79±8.3 in disease duration <10 years, P = 0.009), and higher disease severity (72±4.3 in moderate-to-severe index vs. 88.3 ± 6 in mild index, P = 0.017). Moreover, the mtDNA-CN was negatively correlated with the disease duration and disease severity (r = -0.36, P = 0.006; r = -0.41, P = 0.003 respectively). The ROC analysis of mtDNA-CN showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 0.69-0.98; P = 0.002) for differentiating patients from healthy controls. Our study suggests that low mtDNA-CN may be an early abnormality in psoriasis and associates with the disease progression. Our study also suggests that mtDNA-CN may be a novel blood-based biomarker for the early detection of psoriasis."

https://openalex.org/W4283693058,"Cell death is important in physiology, and can happen as a result of structural damage, or as a sequence of programmed cellular processes known as apoptosis. Pathogenic alterations in apoptosis occur in a number of diseases, including cancer, viral infections, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, and degenerative conditions. Developing accurate and reproducible laboratory methods for inducing and detecting apoptosis is vital for research into these conditions. A number of methods are employed to detect cell death, including DNA fragmentation, the TUNEL assay, and electron microscopy although each has its limitations. Flow cytometry allows for the distinction between live, early apoptotic, late apoptotic and necrotic cells. In this protocol we successfully induce apoptosis using chemical treatment and treatment with low pH in solid tumour cell lines, and have optimized detection using the Annexin V/PI apoptosis assay."
https://openalex.org/W4283693165,"GPS-enabled loggers have been proven as valuable tools for monitoring and understanding animal movement, behaviour and ecology. While the importance of recording accurate location estimates is well established, deployment on many, especially small species, has been limited by logger mass and cost. We developed an open-source and low-cost 0.65 g GPS logger with a simple smartphone-compatible user interface, that can record more than 10,000 GPS fixes on a single 30 mAh battery charge (resulting mass including battery: 1.3 g). This low-budget ‘TickTag’ (currently 32 USD) allows scientists to scale-up studies while becoming a ‘wearable’ for larger animals and simultaneously enabling high-definition studies on small animals. Tests on two different species (domestic dog, Canis lupus familiaris and greater mouse-eared bats, Myotis myotis ) showed that our combination of optimised hardware design and software-based recording strategies increases the number of achievable GPS fixes per g device mass compared to existing micro-sized solutions. We propose that due to the open-source access, as well as low cost and mass, the TickTag fills a technological gap in wildlife ecology and will open up new possibilities for wildlife research and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W4283698347,"To assess the impact of local commissioners' policies for body mass index on access to knee replacement surgery in England.A Natural Experimental Study using interrupted time series and difference-in-differences analysis. We used National Joint Registry for England data linked to the 2015 Index of Multiple Deprivation for 481,555 patients who had primary knee replacement surgery in England between January 2009 and December 2019. Clinical Commissioning Group policies introduced before June 2018 to alter access to knee replacement for patients who were overweight or obese were considered the intervention. The main outcome measures were rate per 100,000 of primary knee replacement surgery and patient demographics (body mass index, Index of Multiple Deprivation, independently-funded surgery) over time.Rates of surgery had a sustained fall after the introduction of a policy (trend change of -0.98 operations per 100,000 population aged 40+, 95% confidence interval -1.22 to -0.74, P<0.001), whereas rates increased in localities with no policy introduction. At three years after introduction, there were 10.5 per 100,000 population fewer operations per quarter aged 40+ compared to the counterfactual, representing a fall of 14.1% from the rate expected had there been no change in trend. There was no dose response effect with policy severity. Rates of surgery fell in all patient groups, including non-obese patients following policy introduction. The proportion of independently-funded operations increased after policy introduction, as did the measure of socioeconomic deprivation of patients.Body mass index policy introduction was associated with decreases in the rates of knee replacement surgery across localities that introduced policies. This affected all patient groups, not just obese patients at whom the policies were targeted. Changes in patient demographics seen after policy introduction suggest these policies may increase health inequalities and further qualitative research is needed to understand their implementation and impact."
https://openalex.org/W4283708233,"The long-term effects of interventions aiming to achieve substantial, sustainable weight loss maintenance have been disappointing. Most people regain their lost weight over time but some seem to be able to maintain their weight loss. We are following the experiences of patients over time prospectively. This study forms the baseline to provide insights into patient experiences prior to entering a primary care-led weight management intervention and their expectations going forward.We recruited 21 adult male and female patients of varying ethnicity with a BMI between 27.7kg/m2 and 48.4kg/m2 from a cohort of patients entering a primary care-led weight management intervention. Patients were offered video and audio interview options during the COVID-19 lockdown. In total, twenty chose the audio option, while one chose the video option. The interview format was semi-structured with room for individual exploration.We found that participants experienced feeling unable to control their weight and encountered a multitude of internal and external barriers to weight management. Some had supportive environments, while others experienced discouraging external influences. Though personal characteristics varied, motivations, goals and expected benefits were similar across this cohort. Most participants had previously experienced transient successful weight-loss attempts with varying approaches. COVID-19 was experienced as an opportunity or barrier for change.This study illustrates the importance of gaining comprehensive insights into the diverse experiences patients encounter when trying to achieve weight loss. Personalized support taking into account individual experiences and circumstances may enhance long-term treatment outcomes. Future research into the complexities of weight management based on individual accounts can aid in the creation of improved treatment protocols."
https://openalex.org/W4285739857,"Background Asthma is one of the most common chronic illnesses among children and adolescents. It can severely affect their quality of life (QoL). Our study assessed the QoL and analyzed potential risk factors for poor QoL among asthmatic children and adolescents. Methods This was a cross-sectional comparative study. Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) was used to measure the QoL and Asthma Control Test (ACT) was used to evaluate asthma control. The Chi-square test and independent t-test were used to compare variables. We used Multivariate logistic regression to identify the association between determinants and outcomes. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Results We recruited 132 participants. We found that 47 patients (35.6%) had controlled Asthma and 85 patients (64.3%) had uncontrolled Asthma. When compared to uncontrolled asthma individuals, participants with controlled asthma had improved QoL and scored significantly higher in the symptom domain (P = 0.002), activity domain (P = 0.004), emotional domain (P = 0.002), and overall PAQoL scores (P = 0.002). Hospital admission affects significantly all domains of PAQOL ( P &lt;0.05). Poor QoL was significantly associated with hospitalization for asthma (OR = 3.4; CI: 2.77–3.94, P = 0 . 01 ), disease severity (OR = 3.0; CI: 2.41–3.61, P = 0 . 01 ), uncontrolled asthma (OR = 2.88; CI: 2.21–3.41, P = 0 . 019 ), and male gender (OR = 2.55; CI: 1.88–2.91, P = 0 . 02 ). Conclusions The results of the present study showed that in children and adolescents, uncontrolled asthma, disease severity, and previously hospitalized patients were associated with poor QoL. These factors must be considered when planning a comprehensive care plan for a better quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4285742027,"Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB) are unique secretory granules of endothelial cells that store the procoagulant von-Willebrand factor (VWF) in a highly compacted form. Upon exocytosis the densely packed VWF unfurls into long strands that expose binding sites for circulating platelets and thereby initiate the formation of a platelet plug at sites of blood vessel injury. Dense packing of VWF requires the establishment of an acidic pH in the lumen of maturing WPB but the mechanism responsible for this acidification has not yet been fully established. We show here that subunits of the vacuolar-type H + -ATPase are present on mature WPB and that interference with the proton pump activity of the ATPase employing inhibitors of different chemical nature blocks a reduction in the relative internal pH of WPB. Furthermore, depletion of the V-ATPase subunit V0d1 from primary endothelial cells prevents WPB pH reduction and the establishment of an elongated morphology of WPB that is dictated by the densely packed VWF tubules. Thus, the vacuolar-type H + -ATPase present on WPB is required for proper acidification and maturation of the organelle."

Transfer in vitro of the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) to nontoxigenic strain CD37 has been reported. We repeated these conjugations using toxigenic strain 630Δerm as donor and NTCD-M3 and CD37 as recipients. In order to conduct these matings we induced rifampin resistance (50ug/ml) in NTCD-M3 by serial passage on rifampin-containing media to obtain strain NTCD-M3r. 630Δerm/CD37 matings produced 21 PaLoc transconjugants in 5.5 x 109 recipient CFUs; a frequency of 3.8 x 10-9. All transconjugants carried the tcdB gene and produced toxin. 630Δerm/NTCD-M3r matings produced no transconjugants in 5 assays with a total of 9.4 x 109 NTCD-M3r recipient cells. Toxin gene transfer to NTCD-M3r could not be demonstrated under conditions that demonstrated transfer to strain CD37.
https://openalex.org/W4285743454,"Contemporary conditions of the functioning of enterprises mean that they are increasingly looking for opportunities to improve organizational performance in strategic management. Scientists are looking for optimal solutions, an appropriate combination of assets and resources, so the debate in the field of strategic orientations is still valid and gaining in importance. Several studies have explored the construct of market orientation, but few include technological orientation with the moderating effects of company assets. In the era of the highly competitive technology market, the area of technological business service providers are particularly interesting, but still undiscovered. This paper examines the effects of market orientation and technological orientation on organizational performance with the inclusion of organizational culture and human resources as moderators. Using questionnaire responses from technological business service providers (n = 689), a regression analysis was conducted to confirm the hypotheses. The results established evidence of positive relationships between market orientation-organizational performance and technological orientation-organizational performance, although in technological firms, the market orientation had a stronger correlation with organizational performance than the technological orientation. Moreover, the organizational culture and human resources play a moderating role in the relationships of market orientation-organizational performance and technological orientation-organizational performance, while weak human resources management weakens relationships market orientation-organizational performance and technological orientation-organizational performance and strong organizational culture reduce the effect of market orientation on organizational performance, significantly reducing the effect of technological orientation on firm performance."
https://openalex.org/W4283687781,"COVID-19 vaccination raised serious concerns among the public and people are mind stuck by various rumors regarding the resulting illness, adverse reactions, and death. Such rumors are dangerous to the campaign against the COVID-19 and should be dealt with accordingly and timely. One prospective solution is to use machine learning-based models to predict the death risk for vaccinated people and clarify people's perceptions regarding death risk. This study focuses on the prediction of the death risks associated with vaccinated people followed by a second dose for two reasons; first to build consensus among people to get the vaccines; second, to reduce the fear regarding vaccines. Given that, this study utilizes the COVID-19 VAERS dataset that records adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination as 'recovered', 'not recovered', and 'survived'. To obtain better prediction results, a novel voting classifier extreme regression-voting classifier (ER-VC) is introduced. ER-VC ensembles extra tree classifier and logistic regression using soft voting criterion. To avoid model overfitting and get better results, two data balancing techniques synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) and adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) have been applied. Moreover, three feature extraction techniques term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), bag of words (BoW), and global vectors (GloVe) have been used for comparison. Both machine learning and deep learning models are deployed for experiments. Results obtained from extensive experiments reveal that the proposed model in combination with TF-TDF has shown robust results with a 0.85 accuracy when trained on the SMOTE-balanced dataset. In line with this, validation of the proposed voting classifier on binary classification shows state-of-the-art results with a 0.98 accuracy. Results show that machine learning models can predict the death risk with high accuracy and can assist the authors in taking timely measures."
https://openalex.org/W4283692649,"This study examined the roles of visual and olfactory responses during foraging and courtship in butterfly Papilio xuthus. P. xuthus showed obvious orientation to color in the range of 350-500 nm. Visits of P. xuthus females and males to blue, purple, and red artificial cloth flowers were ♀ 54.90% and ♂ 39.22%, ♀ 19.61% and ♂ 35.29%, and ♀ 9.80% and ♂ 19.61%, respectively. Application of 10% honey on these artificial flowers resulted in an increase of 3.41 and 3.26 fold in flower visits by the butterfly compared to controls. When 10% honey water was sprayed on flower branches without colorful flowers, branch visiting was very low, only seven times for females and two times for males, indicating that colors might be more critical than odor for foraging even though visual and olfactory perceptions both play important roles during foraging. During courtship, four types of chasing were observed in a natural population of P. Xuthus; the four types are males chasing females (49%), males chasing males (25%), females chasing males (13%), and females chasing females (10%). However, when odorless artificial models of butterflies were used, no significant differences were observed among these types of chasing, indicating that olfactory perception was crucial for the butterfly during courtship. Profiling volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and individual bioassays revealed that VOCs contents of butterflies were not related to recognizing sex partners; by contrast, some level of α-farnesene, increased the frequency of male chasing female. This could be due to that α-farnesene is easy to be detected by butterflies because of its volatility and higher content in female."
https://openalex.org/W4283693822,"The rapid invasion of Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) throughout Europe and the Americas has led to an increased reliance on calendar-based broad-spectrum insecticide programs among berry and cherry growers. Relatively few active ingredients (AIs) are currently available for effective D. suzukii management, and studies from multiple growing regions indicate that susceptibility to at least some of these materials is declining. Greater effort is needed to understand the status of susceptibility across field populations and the potential for increased resistance to develop, as well as the possible fitness costs incurred by resistant individuals. However, current bioassay protocols used for resistance monitoring and selection studies (i.e. resistance risk assessments) are labor-intensive and costly, making large-scale studies difficult to conduct. Here, we first present a novel bioassay protocol using larvae that requires little effort or cost to implement beyond what is needed for basic D. suzukii laboratory colony maintenance. We then perform dose-response bioassays using this protocol to identify larval lethal concentrations for three commonly used insecticides (malathion, spinosad and zeta-cypermethrin) in a susceptible population. Finally, resistance risk assessments were conducted using a population of D. suzukii from commercial caneberry fields near Watsonville, CA. We find that five generations of larval selection with a discriminating dose is sufficient to significantly increase both larval (malathion and spinosad) and adult (spinosad) resistance to the target AIs. This approach provides a simple, cost-effective tool for assaying susceptibility of D. suzukii populations to insecticides and for selecting resistant insect lines for resistance management research."

Aporate 3-zonocolpate pollen, identified as Vitis, together with tartaric, malic and pyruvic acids elucidate the grape-fermented nature of the content. Our conclusions open new consideration on the use of grape derivatives that cannot be supported by traditional analytical methods. Based on the finds of aporate Vitis pollen, found also in local modern and Middle Pleistocene samples, we hypothesize the use of autochthonous vines. The presence of a medicinal wine (historically reported as oenanthium) is also considered. We interrogate Vitis pollen capacity to target grapevine domestication, thereby providing innovative tools to understand such an important process.

FDG-uptake of the most active echinococcosis manifestation was measured (i.e., maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and in relation to background activity in normal liver tissue (SUVratio)) and compared to immunodiagnostic testing. For clinical patient follow-up, patient demographics, laboratory data, including E. granulosus hydatid fluid (EgHF) antibody units (AU) as well as clinical and treatment information were assessed for all patients at the time of PET/CT, and at the last recorded clinical visit.Metabolic activity of PET/CT measured in the echinococcosis manifestation was significantly correlated with EgHF AU (p < 0.001). The differences in metabolic activity of echinococcosis manifestations between two consecutive PET/CT examinations of the same patient and differences in EgHF AU in the respective time intervals displayed a significant positive correlation (p = 0.01). A trend for a more rapid decline in SUVratio liver over time was found in patients who stopped benzimidazole therapy versus patients who did not stop therapy (p = 0.059).In inoperable patients with alveolar echinococcosis, the course of metabolic activity in follow-up PET/CT is associated to the course EgHF antibody levels. Both parameters may potentially be used to evaluate the course of the disease and potentially predict the duration of benzimidazole therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4283712932,"We propose a stochastic generative model to represent a directed graph constructed by citations among academic papers, where nodes and directed edges represent papers with discrete publication time and citations respectively. The proposed model assumes that a citation between two papers occurs with a probability based on the type of the citing paper, the importance of cited paper, and the difference between their publication times, like the existing models. We consider the out-degrees of citing paper as its type, because, for example, survey paper cites many papers. We approximate the importance of a cited paper by its in-degrees. In our model, we adopt three functions: a logistic function for illustrating the numbers of papers published in discrete time, an inverse Gaussian probability distribution function to express the aging effect based on the difference between publication times, and an exponential distribution (or a generalized Pareto distribution) for describing the out-degree distribution. We consider that our model is a more reasonable and appropriate stochastic model than other existing models and can perform complete simulations without using original data. In this paper, we first use the Web of Science database and see the features used in our model. By using the proposed model, we can generate simulated graphs and demonstrate that they are similar to the original data concerning the in- and out-degree distributions, and node triangle participation. In addition, we analyze two other citation networks derived from physics papers in the arXiv database and verify the effectiveness of the model."

Likert-scale questions were asked regarding the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of literate Ghanaians towards COVID-19 vaccines. Kruskal-Wallis and sample t-test were performed to ascertain the differences in vaccination intentions between key socioeconomic variables. A pairwise correlation was performed to examine the relationship between vaccination intensions and fear of the unforeseen, mistrust of the vaccine and concerns of profiteering. Finally, a binary probit regression model was fitted to examine the predictive effect of key variables on respondent's vaccination intentions.The results revealed a relatively low level of knowledge about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines. The sample t-test showed that males have a relatively positive attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccines than females at 5% level of significance. Mistrust of vaccine safety and efficacy have a significant negative influence on vaccination intensions at 1% significance level.This study provides the Ghanaian government and other stakeholders with useful information to aid in educational campaigns on the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. More campaign efforts towards females could help increase uptake given their relatively poor attitudes towards the vaccine."

Phantoms were imaged with four different concentrations of diluted Gd-DOTA representing established arterial concentrations after intravenous injection in humans. Samples were centrally positioned in a thorax phantom of 30 cm diameter filled with a custom-made liquid featuring dielectric properties of muscle tissue. MRI was performed on a 7 T whole-body system. 2D-gradient-echo sequences were acquired with an 8-channel transmit 16-channel receive (8 Tx / 16 Rx) cardiac array prototype coil with and without pTX mode. Measurements were compared to those obtained with identical scan parameters using a commercially available 1 Tx / 16 Rx single transmit coil (sTX). To assess reproducibility, measurements (n = 15) were repeated at different horizontal angles with respect to the B0-field.B1-shimming and pTX markedly improved flip angle homogeneity across the thorax phantom yielding a distinctly increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) averaged over a whole slice relative to non-manipulated RF fields. Images without B1-shimming showed shading artifacts due to local B1+-field inhomogeneities, which hampered stenosis quantification in severe cases. In contrast, B1-shimming and pTX provided superior image homogeneity. Compared with a conventional sTX coil higher grade stenoses (60% and 80%) were graded significantly (p<0.01) more precise. Mild to moderate grade stenoses did not show significant differences. Overall, SNR was distinctly higher with B1-shimming and pTX than with the conventional sTX coil (inside the stenosis phantoms 14%, outside the phantoms 32%). Both full and half concentration (10.2 mM and 5.1 mM) of a conventional Gd-DOTA dose for humans were equally suitable for stenosis evaluation in this phantom study.B1-shimming and pTX at 7 T can distinctly improve image homogeneity and therefore provide considerably more accurate MR image analysis, which is beneficial for imaging of small vessel structures."
https://openalex.org/W4285742060,"Background Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) lies in the intersection of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Although HCAP is excluded from the revised HAP guideline, reassessment for HCAP is needed considering its heterogeneous characteristics. Methods The microbiological distribution, antibiotic resistance, and clinical outcomes in CAP, HCAP, and HAP were studied retrospectively. The susceptibility to standard CAP regimens (β-lactams plus macrolide or fluoroquinolone monotherapy) and rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P . aeruginosa ) infections were evaluated in the CAP group and HCAP subgroups. Results In total, 933 cases were included (CAP, n = 557; HCAP, n = 264; HAP, n = 112). In the CAP and HCAP cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.4% vs. 5.7%) and P . aeruginosa (9.2% vs. 18.6%) were the most common gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant, 2.7%; methicillin-susceptible, 2.4%) and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (20.5%) were the most common Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens in the HAP group, respectively. Higher susceptibility to levofloxacin was observed in CAP and HCAP isolates than that to β-lactam agents. However, levofloxacin non-susceptibility was significantly higher in long-term care facility (LTCF)-onset HCAP compared to community-onset HCAP (43.6% vs. 22.7%, P = 0.014). Conclusion HCAP showed higher rates of P . aeruginosa and MRSA infections than CAP. Empirical antipseudomonal therapy should be considered in the treatment of HCAP. Prior isolation of P . aeruginosa was the most important risk factor for P . aeruginosa infection."
https://openalex.org/W4285742258,"This study examined the relationship between variables about family members co-residing during the COVID-19 pandemic and anxiety about COVID-19, domestic violence from spouse, child abuse anxiety, internet addiction, and mental health as social problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 220 parents (70 male and 150 female, age; M = 41.6, SD = 34.4) were included in the analysis. Stepwise hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted with dependent variables of fear of COVID-19, spousal violence, anxiety regarding perpetrating child abuse, internet addiction, and mental health. The independent variables were basic variables related to family members such as family composition. The results demonstrated that parents with preschool children were anxious about the possibility that they might abuse their children ( β = .203, p &lt; .01). Subjects who smoked were associated with anxiety about being the victim of domestic violence by their spouse ( β = .154, p &lt; .05). Those whose income had decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, those who were employed, and those with few rooms in their house were more likely to be dependent on the Internet (in order, β = .189, p &lt; .01; β = .196, p &lt; .01; β = -.140, p &lt; .05). Finally, mental health was impaired among those whose income was reduced by the COVID-19 pandemic ( β = .134, p &lt; .05) and among those who had conflicting opinions in their families regarding the pandemic ( β = .206, p &lt; .01). These results indicate that family variables are associated with family social problems. Additionally, we assume these have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While further research is required to determine the causal relationships among the variables, the findings can be used as an indicator of support that should be provided to families."
https://openalex.org/W4285742465,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a high-risk factor for acute cardiovascular events. Some reports show that Empagliflozin has a protective effect on cardiovascular events and diabetes mellitus, and Empagliflozin can act on the CaMKII pathway. However, the specific gene of action is not precise. Therefore, this study investigated the target genes of Empagliflozin by integrated gene analysis and molecular docking method to provide a theoretical basis for further elucidating the mechanism of action of Empagliflozin.In this study, we obtained 12 datasets from GEO, divided into experimental and validation groups, with a total of 376 samples. We then integrated CaMKII pathway-related genes from OMIM, NCBI, and genecards databases. We then intersected them with the differential genes we obtained to obtain 5 common genes and performed functional enrichment analysis. We then performed group comparisons in the validation set, and we obtained 2 clinically significant genes. Then we performed group comparison in the validation set, and we obtained 2 clinically significant genes, followed by molecular docking analysis with pymol, autodock software. We obtained molecular docking models for the 2 genes.In this study, we obtained CaMK2G and PPP1CA, genes associated with the CaMKII pathway and type 2 diabetes and acute cardiovascular events, by integrative gene analysis and validated their expression in the relevant dataset. We also derived that Empagliflozin acts on amino acid TRP-125 of CaMK2G gene and GLN-249 ASP-210 ASP-208 of PPP1CA through CaMKII pathway, thus acting on type 2 diabetes and acute cardiovascular events by molecular docking technique."
https://openalex.org/W4285743121,"Background Inappropriate Anti-diabetic Medication Therapy (IADT) refers to a drug-related problem and includes ‘ineffective drug therapy’, ‘unnecessary drug therapy’, ‘dosage too high’, and ‘dosage too low’. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with IADT among T2DM patients at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda (MRRH). Method A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the medical and surgical wards of MRRH from November 2021 to January 2022. One hundred and thirty-eight adult patients aged 18 years and above, with T2DM, were recruited using consecutive sampling. Patient file reviews and interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. The data were entered into and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Descriptive analysis was employed to describe the population and determine the prevalence of IADT. Types of IADTs were identified using Cipolle’s DRP classification tool. A univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors significantly associated with IADT. The P-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant at 95% confidence interval. Results A total of 138 hospitalized T2DM patients were studied. Eighty (58.0%) were females, and 70 (50.7%) were ≥ 60 years of age. Out of a total of 138 participants, 97 experienced at least one IADT, with an estimated prevalence of 70.3%. ‘Dosage too high’ (29.2%) and ‘dosage too low’ (27.9%) were the most common type of IADTs. Age ≥ 60 years (AOR, 8.44; 95% CI, 2.09–10.90; P-value = 0.003), T2DM duration of &lt; 1 year (AOR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.11–0.35; P-value = 0.019), and HbA1c of &lt; 7% (AOR, 9.97; 95% CI, 2.34–13.57; P-value = 0.002) were found to be factors significantly associated with the occurrence of IADTs. Conclusion The overall prevalence of inappropriate anti-diabetic medication therapy among T2DM patients admitted to medical and surgical wards of MRRH was 70.3%. The most common type of IADT in this study was ‘dosage too high’, accounting for almost one-third followed by ‘dosage too low’ accounting for a quarter of total IADTs. Age greater or equal to 60 years, T2DM duration of &lt; 1 year, and HbA1c of &lt; 7% during the current admission were found to be factors significantly associated with the occurrence of IADTs in hospitalized T2DM patients."
https://openalex.org/W4285743983,"Millimetre-wave frequencies are promising for sensitive detection of glucose levels in the blood, where the temperature effect is insignificant. All these features provide the feasibility of continuous, portable, and accurate monitoring of glucose levels. This paper presents a metamaterial-inspired resonator comprising five split-rings to detect glucose levels at 24.9 GHz. The plexiglass case containing blood is modelled on the sensor's surface and the structure is simulated for the glucose levels in blood from 50 mg/dl to 120 mg/dl. The novelty of the sensor is demonstrated by the capability to sense the normal glucose levels at millimetre-wave frequencies. The dielectric characteristics of the blood are modelled by using the Debye parameters. The proposed design can detect small changes in the dielectric properties of blood caused by varying glucose levels. The variation in the transmission coefficient for each glucose level tested in this study is determined by the quality factor and resonant frequency. The sensor presented can detect the change in the quality factor of transmission response up to 2.71/mg/dl. The sensor's performance has also been tested to detect diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome. The sensor showed a linear shift in resonant frequency with the change in glucose levels, and an R2 of 0.9976 was obtained by applying regression analysis. Thus, the sensor can be used to monitor glucose in a normal range as well as at extreme levels."
https://openalex.org/W4283692373,"Global broiler production and consumption levels continue to rise. South Africa’s broiler system is dominated by commercial production and formal retail trade, with competition from cheap imports. Local broiler policies have narrow, production-driven, short-term aims for industry growth and national food security. However, these have unintended consequences that undermine the system’s future sustainability. Using a food systems approach, this study developed a qualitative system dynamics model of the South African commercial broiler system and used it to engage stakeholders in policy discussions within the boundaries of health, nutrition, and environmental sustainability. A problem statement and key system elements were drawn from a previously published qualitative study and were validated by 15 stakeholders via an online questionnaire. From this, a seed model was developed, expanded into a larger model, and shared in a modular format with stakeholders in virtual meetings, on an individual or institutional basis, for feedback and validation, and for discussion of areas for policy consideration. Refinements were incorporated into the modules, policy considerations were summarised, and crosscutting issues were identified. The model demonstrated the system’s complexity, interlinkages, feedbacks, reinforcing and balancing loops, and behaviour archetypes. The modular presentation format created a suitable platform for stakeholder engagement. Current policies focus on local commercial production, formal markets, and affordability without cognisance of the broader system represented by the model. Inequality pervades throughout the system. Commercial producers, linked to large supermarkets and fast-food chains, dominate the system, presenting barriers to entry. Affordability is unintentionally traded off against non-communicable disease risks through brining of most frozen products, and ultra-processing of fast-food items. Foodborne disease control is critical, given the proportion of vulnerable individuals, and greater coherence of food safety policy is urgently needed. The environmental footprint of broilers, whilst less than that of ruminants, deserves closer scrutiny based on its dependence on intensive cereal production for feed. This study’s food systems approach provides a system-wide perspective and a foundation for policymakers to develop more integrated and transformative policies."
https://openalex.org/W4283695327,"Robo-advice technology refers to services offered by a virtual financial advisor based on artificial intelligence. Research on the application of robo-advice technology already highlights the potential benefit in terms of financial inclusion. We analyze the process for adopting robo-advice through the technology acceptance model (TAM), focusing on a highly educated sample and exploring generational and gender differences. We find no significant gender difference in the causality links with adoption, although some structural differences still arise between male and female groups. Further, we find evidence that generational cohorts affect the path to future adoption of robo-advice technology. Indeed, the ease of use is the factor which triggers the adoption by Generation Z and Generation Y, whereas the perceived usefulness of robo-advice technology is the key factor driving Generation X+, who need to understand the ultimate purpose of a robo-advice technology tool before adopting it. Overall, the above findings may reflect that, while gender differences are wiped out in a highly educated population, generation effects still matter in the adoption of a robo-advice technology tool."
https://openalex.org/W4283702760,"Since 2000, two lineages of influenza B viruses, Victoria and Yamagata, have been circulating at similar frequencies worldwide. Little is known about the circulation of those viruses in Egypt. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of influenza B virus infections in Egypt, 2017–2019. This was performed through a household prospective cohort study on influenza infections among 2400 individuals from five villages. When a study participant had influenza like symptoms, a nasal swab and an oropharyngeal swab were obtained and tested by RT-PCR for influenza B infections. A serum sample was obtained from all participants annually to detect neutralizing antibodies using microneutralization assay. 9.1% of subjects were positive for influenza B viruses during season 2017–2018 mostly among preschoolers and 7.6% were positive during the season 2018–2019 with higher risk in females, potentially due to mothers being infected after contact with their children. The overall seroprevalence among the participants was 53.2% and 52.2% against the Victoria and Yamagata lineages respectively, the majority of seropositive participants were students. Multivariate analysis showed that age and having chronic diseases were the strongest predictors of infection. Our results show that both influenza B lineages circulated between 2017 and 2020 in Egypt almost in equal proportion. Encouraging the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccines is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4283703581,"This study was conducted to investigate the incidence of lumbar degeneration findings and low back pain (LBP) in children and adolescent weightlifters using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and medical questionnaires over a 5-year period. Moreover, we aimed to reveal the temporal changes in the lumbar vertebrae caused by long-term weightlifting training during the growth period. Twelve children and adolescent weightlifters who participated in weightlifting for &gt;2 years (six boys, six girls, 11.4±2.0 years) were enrolled. Participants underwent annual medical questionnaire surveys, including data on practice frequency, competition history, presence of LBP, and lumbar examinations using MRI during the 5-year follow-up. Lumbar disc degeneration was detected in all the participants after 4 years, and lumbar disc herniation findings were detected in 33% of participants after 5 years; one underwent herniotomy during the follow-up period. Lumbar spondylolysis was detected in 58% of patients at 5 years. Although there were three participants who had LBP in the final year, none had LBP that prevented them from returning to weightlifting. This 5-year cohort study of 12 children and adolescent weightlifters detected lumbar degeneration in all participants. High frequency weightlifting training over a long period during the growth period may increase the risk of developing current and future LBP."
https://openalex.org/W4283709422,"Purpose To evaluate whether the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can predict the need for ureteral catheterization in patients with renal colic. Materials and methods We retrospectively studied 15,887 patients with renal colic between 2005 and 2019. Patients with prior antibiotics treatment (156), with hematological diseases (15), with negative computerized tomography scan (CTS) for stone disease (473) or with no available laboratory findings (1750) were excluded. A ureteral double J stent (DJS) was inserted in case of ongoing pain, fever, sepsis, single kidney and elevated blood creatinine levels concomitant with hydronephrosis. A cut-off value of 2.1 NLR was determined to stratify and to compare patients using multivariable logistic regression models. A locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) plot was also applied to show the relationship between NLR and predicted probability for DJS insertion. Results Thirteen-thousand and 493 patients with a mean age of 42.7 years (30% females and 70% males) were included in the study. Five-hundred and 57 patients (4.1%) underwent early DJS insertion: 5.3% vs. 1.5% of patients with high vs. low NLR, respectively, ( p &lt;0.001). High NLR was significantly associated with longer hospitalization time, admission to the intensive care unit and overall mortality within a month from admission ( p &lt;0.05). LOWESS plot showed that NLR value &gt;2.1 escalates progressively the probability for DJS insertion. Conclusions A high NLR is associated with the need for early internal DJS insertion due to urolithiasis. The NLR is easily calculated from simple blood tests and based on our results can be used for clinical decision making in patients with renal colic needing renal decompression."
https://openalex.org/W4285685061,"Organic molecules preserved in fossils provide a wealth of new information about ancient life. The discovery of almost unaltered complex organic molecules in well-preserved fossils raise the question of how common such occurrences are in the fossil record, how to differentiate between endogenous and exogenous sources for the organic matter and what promotes such preservation. The aim of this study was the in-situ analysis of a well-preserved vertebrate fossil from 48 Ma Eocene sediments in the Messel pit, Germany for preservation of complex biomolecules. The fossil was characterized using a variety of techniques including time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. A suite of organic molecules was detected, including porphyrins, which given the context of the detected signal are most probably diagenetically altered heme originating from the fossil though a microbial contribution cannot be completely ruled out. Diagenetic changes to the porphyrin structure were observed that included the exchange of the central iron by nickel. Further analyses on the geochemistry of the fossil and surrounding sediments showed presence of pyrite and aluminosilicates, most likely clay. In addition, a carbonate and calcium phosphate dominated crust has formed around the fossil. This suggests that several different processes are involved in the preservation of the fossil and the organic molecules associated with it. Similar processes seem to have also been involved in preservation of heme in fossils from other localities."
https://openalex.org/W4285741022,"Yam anthracnose is one of the most serious fungal diseases affecting white and water yam production. Screening of available landraces for new sources of durable resistance to the pathogen is a continuous process. In the present study, the pathogens causing anthracnose in Dioscorea alata and Dioscorea rotundata farms in Cross River State yam belt region were characterized. Diseased yam leaves with anthracnose symptoms collected from the farms were used in the isolation, purification and, identification of C. alatae strains using morphological, cultural, and molecular methods. Leaf chlorosis, leaf edge necrosis, blights, dark brown to black leaf spots, shot holes, necrotic vein banding and vein browning were the predominantly observed symptoms. Seven isolates of C. alatae, Ca5, Ca14, Ca16, Ca22, Ca24, Ca32 and Ca34, and one isolate of Lasidioplodia theobromae, Lt1 were found to be associated with yam infection in Cross River State, with Lt1 as the most prevalent, occurring in all the locations. These isolates were classified into four forms which included the slow-growing grey (SGG), the fast-growing grey (FGG), the fast-growing salmon (FGS), and the fast-growing olive (FGO). Sequence analysis of the ITS region revealed <80% nucleotide identity between the isolates and the reference C. gloeosporioides. Pathogenicity test showed that all the isolates displayed typical symptoms of anthracnose disease as were observed in the field, but Lt1 was the most virulent. Inoculation of 20 D. alata and 13 D. rotundata landraces with isolate Lt1, showed that 63.64% of the landraces were susceptible while 36.36%were resistant. D. alata landraces were the most susceptible. This study revealed that anthracnose is prevalent and may assume an epidemic dimension in the yam growing communities of the state. There is need for increased effort in the breeding of yam for anthracnose resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4285744634,"Depression is rarely screened for among People Living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIV) although it is 2 to 3 times more prevalent among PLHIV than in the general population. In instances where depression is screened for using screening tools, it usually follows noticing depression risk factors. This practice of selectively screening for depression could be leaving some cases of depression unattended to. On the other hand, subjecting every client to screening tools (non-selective screening) offers every patient an opportunity to be managed for depression. However, this could require additional resources as compared to selective screening. We present and discuss results on whether non-selective and selective screening strategies differ in depression case detection, and in addition, we also present perceptions of the stake holders on the two screening strategies.The study was conducted in Princess Diana Memorial Health Centre IV HIV clinic using a randomized controlled trial with a qualitative component. To determine whether there was a difference in depression case detection, consecutively sampled participants were randomly allocated to either non-selective or selective screening strategy. Participants allocated to selective screening were screened for depression using the patient health questionnaire (s) (PHQs) if they were at ""crisis points"". While those allocated to non-selective screening were screened regardless of whether the ""crisis points"" were noticed or not. The PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 were used in sequence. 326 PLHIV participated in the study. Outcomes of the MINI evaluation were analyzed for those with PHQ-9 scores of 10 or more to confirm major depressive disorder (MDD). Data was analyzed using the two sample Z-test for proportions with Stata 2013 software. To explore the perceptions of the stake holders, key informant interviews were performed with six stakeholders that experienced the study.Cases of depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 5) were more likely to be detected by the non-selective screening strategy 30.2% (49/162) compared to the selective screening strategy 19.5% (32/164) (difference in proportions 0.107, 95% confidence interval 0.014-0.200, Cohen's h = 0.25, P = 0.03). The stake holders thought it was important to screen for depression among PLHIV with preference to non-selective screening strategy.Evidence from this data suggests that more cases of depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 5) are likely to be detected with non-selective screening as opposed to selective screening.PACTR201802003141213 (name: comparison of routine versus selective screening for depression strategies among PLHIV attending Princess Diana Memorial Health Centre iv Soroti)."
