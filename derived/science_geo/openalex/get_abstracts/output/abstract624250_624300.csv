However, the development of such therapies requires the identification of targetable drivers of cancer development and metastasis. The expression and nuclear localization of the transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are increased in many human cancers, and experimental evidence indicates that aberrant YAP or TAZ activation drives tumor formation and metastasis. Although these findings make YAP and TAZ appealing therapeutic targets, both have important functions in adult tissues, so directly targeting them could cause adverse effects. The identification of pathways active in cancer cells and required for YAP/TAZ activity could provide a way to inhibit YAP and TAZ. Here, we show that SRC proto-oncogene, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) is an important driver of YAP/TAZ activity in human breast cancer and melanoma cells. SRC activation increased YAP/TAZ activity and the expression of YAP/TAZ-regulated genes. In contrast, SRC inhibition or knockdown repressed both YAP/TAZ activity and the expression of YAP/TAZ-regulated genes. We also show that SRC increases the activity of YAP and TAZ by repressing large tumor suppressor homolog (LATS), and we identify the GTPase-activating protein GIT ArfGAP 1 (GIT1) as an SRC effector that regulates both YAP and TAZ. Importantly, we demonstrate that SRC-mediated YAP/TAZ activity promotes tumor growth and enhances metastasis and that SRC-dependent tumor progression depends, at least in part, on YAP and TAZ. Our findings suggest that therapies targeting SRC could help manage some YAP/TAZ-dependent cancers."

To overcome this problem, we established a scaffold-free system for assembling cell constructs using an automated Bio-3D printer. This printer has previously been used to fabricate other three-dimensional (3D) constructs, including liver, blood vessels, and cartilage. In the present study, we tested the function in vivo of scaffold-free cardiac tubular construct fabricated using this system. Cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iCells), endothelial cells, and fibroblasts were combined to make the spheroids. Subsequently, tubular cardiac constructs were fabricated by Bio-3D printer placing the spheroids on a needle array. Notably, the spheroid fusion and beat rate in the constructs were observed while still on the needle array. After removal from the needle array, electrical stimulation was used to test responsiveness of the constructs. An increased beat rate was observed during stimulation. Importantly, the constructs returned to their initial beat rate after stimulation was stopped. In addition, histological analysis shows cellular reorganization occurring in the cardiac constructs, which may mimic that observed during organ transplantation. Taken together, our results indicate that these engineered cardiac tubular constructs, which address both the limited supply of donor tissues as well as the immune-induced transplant rejection, has potential to be used for both clinical and drug testing applications. To our knowledge, this is the first time that cardiac tubular constructs have been produced using optimized Bio-3D printing technique and subsequently tested for their use as cardiac pumps."

Loss-of-function mutations in SLC30A10, a cell surface–localized manganese efflux transporter in the brain and liver, induce familial manganese neurotoxicity. To elucidate the role of SLC30A10 in regulating brain manganese, we compared the phenotypes of whole-body and tissue-specific Slc30a10 knockout mice. Surprisingly, unlike whole-body knockouts, brain manganese levels were unaltered in pan-neuronal/glial Slc30a10 knockouts under basal physiological conditions. Further, although transport into bile is a major route of manganese excretion, manganese levels in the brain, blood, and liver of liver-specific Slc30a10 knockouts were only minimally elevated, suggesting that another organ compensated for loss-of-function in the liver. Additional assays revealed that SLC30A10 was also expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. In differentiated enterocytes, SLC30A10 localized to the apical/luminal domain and transported intracellular manganese to the lumen. Importantly, endoderm-specific knockouts, lacking SLC30A10 in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, had markedly elevated manganese levels in the brain, blood, and liver. Thus, under basal physiological conditions, brain manganese is regulated by activity of SLC30A10 in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, and not the brain or just the liver. Notably, however, brain manganese levels of endoderm-specific knockouts were lower than whole-body knockouts, and only whole-body knockouts exhibited manganese-induced neurobehavioral defects. Moreover, after elevated exposure, pan-neuronal/glial knockouts had higher manganese levels in the basal ganglia and thalamus than controls. Therefore, when manganese levels increase, activity of SLC30A10 in the brain protects against neurotoxicity. The essential metal manganese becomes neurotoxic at elevated levels.

Despite the clinical relevance, mechanisms by which manganese homeostasis is regulated at the whole-animal level in general, and in the brain in particular, remain unclear.

Overall, available data identify SLC30A10 to be a critical regulator of manganese homeostasis and detoxification. Despite the above studies, the fundamental question of how manganese homeostasis in the brain is regulated is unclear.

These results indicate that activity of SLC30A10 in the liver is crucial for hepatic manganese excretion (23Liu C. Hutchens S. Jursa T. Shawlot W. Polishchuk E.V. Polishchuk R.S. Dray B.K. Gore A.C.

Thus, a second possibility is that tissue manganese levels, including in the brain, may be controlled by the activity of SLC30A10 in the liver. Determining the mechanisms by which the function of SLC30A10 in different organs regulates brain manganese is an essential step in elucidating the pathobiology of manganese neurotoxicity. To address this issue, we compared the phenotypes of tissue-specific and whole-body Slc30a10 knockout mice. We report the surprising finding that, under basal physiological conditions, activity of SLC30A10 in the entire digestive system, and not the brain or just the liver, regulates brain manganese. Expression of SLC30A10 in the brain becomes important when tissue manganese levels increase; under these conditions, activity of SLC30A10 in the brain reduces manganese levels and protects against neurotoxicity. Our findings identify the digestive system, including extrahepatic components, as a critical mediator in the biology of manganese neurotoxicity at the whole-organism level. Additionally, these results imply that there are previously unappreciated complexities in the homeostatic control of manganese in the brain under basal and elevated exposure conditions. As a positive control for the current study, we recapitulated the previously described phenotype of whole-body Slc30a10 knockout mice (referred to as Slc30a10−/− mice here) in a new cohort analyzed contemporaneously with tissue-specific knockouts.

https://openalex.org/W2951137453,"Protein extracts obtained from cells or tissues often require removal of interfering substances for the preparation of high-quality protein samples in proteomic analysis. A number of protein extraction methods have been applied to various biological samples. TCA/acetone precipitation and phenol extraction, a common method of protein extraction, is thought to minimize protein degradation and activity of proteases as well as reduce contaminants like salts and polyphenols. However, the TCA/acetone precipitation method relies on the complete pulverization and repeated rinsing of tissue powder to remove the interfering substances, which is laborious and time-consuming. In addition, by prolonged incubation in TCA/acetone, the precipitated proteins are more difficult to re-dissolve. We have described a modified method of TCA/acetone precipitation of plant proteins for proteomic analysis. Proteins of cells or tissues were extracted using SDS-containing buffer, precipitated with equal volume of 20% TCA/acetone, and washed with acetone. Compared to classical TCA/acetone precipitation and simple acetone precipitation, this protocol generates comparable yields, spot numbers, and proteome profiling, but takes less time (ca. 45 min), thus avoiding excess protein modification and degradation after extended-period incubation in TCA/acetone or acetone. The modified TCA/acetone precipitation method is simple, fast, and suitable for proteomic analysis of various plant tissues in proteomic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2903603575,"As whole exome sequencing (WES) becomes more widely used in the clinical realm, a wealth of unanalyzed information will be routinely generated. Using WES read depth data to predict copy number variation (CNV) could extend the diagnostic utility of this previously underutilized data by providing clinically important information such as previously unsuspected deletions or duplications. We evaluated ExomeDepth, a free R package, in addition to an aneuploidy prediction method, to detect CNVs in WES data. First, in a blinded pilot study, five out of five genomic alterations were correctly identified from clinical samples with previously defined chromosomal gains or losses, including submicroscopic deletions, duplications, and chromosomal trisomy. We then examined CNV calls among 53 patients participating in the NCGENES research study and undergoing WES, who had existing clinical chromosomal microarray (CMA) data that could be used for validation. For unique CNVs that overlap well with WES coverage regions, sensitivity was 89% for deletions and 65% for duplications. While specificity of the algorithm calls remains a concern, this is less of an issue at high threshold filtering levels. When applied to all 672 patients from the exome sequencing study, ExomeDepth identified eleven diagnostically relevant CNVs ranging in size from a two exon deletion to whole chromosome duplications, as well as numerous other CNVs with varying clinical significance. This opportunistic analysis of WES data yields an additional 1.6% of patients in this study with pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs that are clinically relevant to their phenotype as well as clinically relevant secondary findings. Finally, we demonstrate the potential value of copy number analysis in cases where a single heterozygous likely or known pathogenic single nucleotide alteration is identified in a gene associated with an autosomal recessive condition."
https://openalex.org/W2903572769,"Human mini-brains (MB) are cerebral organoids that recapitulate in part the complexity of the human brain in a unique three-dimensional in vitro model, yielding discrete brain regions reminiscent of the cerebral cortex. Specific proteins linked to neurodegenerative disorders are physiologically expressed in MBs, such as APP-derived amyloids (Aβ), whose physiological and pathological roles and interactions with other proteins are not well established in humans. Here, we demonstrate that neuroectodermal organoids can be used to study the Aβ accumulation implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To enhance the process of protein secretion and accumulation, we adopted a chemical strategy of induction to modulate post-translational pathways of APP using an Amyloid-β Forty-Two Inducer named Aftin-5. Secreted, soluble Aβ fragment concentrations were analyzed in MB-conditioned media. An increase in the Aβ42 fragment secretion was observed as was an increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio after drug treatment, which is consistent with the pathological-like phenotypes described in vivo in transgenic animal models and in vitro in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cultures obtained from AD patients. Notably in this context we observe time-dependent Aβ accumulation, which differs from protein accumulation occurring after treatment. We show that mini-brains obtained from a non-AD control cell line are responsive to chemical compound induction, producing a shift of physiological Aβ concentrations, suggesting that this model can be used to identify environmental agents that may initiate the cascade of events ultimately leading to sporadic AD. Increases in both Aβ oligomers and their target, the cellular prion protein (PrPC), support the possibility of using MBs to further understand the pathophysiological role that underlies their interaction in a human model. Finally, the potential application of MBs for modeling age-associated phenotypes and the study of neurological disorders is confirmed."

Different flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases regioselectively chlorinate or brominate trypto-phan's indole moiety at C5, C6, or C7. Here, we present the first substrate-bound structure of a tryptophan 6-halogenase, namely Thal, also known as ThdH, from the bacterium Streptomyces albogriseolus at 2.55 Å resolution. The structure revealed that the C6 of tryptophan is positioned next to the ∈-amino group of a conserved lysine, confirming the hypothesis that proximity to the catalytic residue determines the site of electrophilic aromatic substitution. Although Thal is more similar in sequence and structure to the tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH than to the tryptophan 5-halogenase PyrH, the indole binding pose in the Thal active site more closely resembled that of PyrH than that of RebH. The difference in indole orientation between Thal and RebH appeared to be largely governed by residues positioning the Trp backbone atoms. The sequences of Thal and RebH lining the substrate binding site differ in only few residues. Therefore, we exchanged five amino acids in the Thal active site with the corresponding counterparts in RebH, generating the quintuple variant Thal-RebH5. Overall conversion of l-Trp by the Thal-RebH5 variant resembled that of WT Thal, but its regioselectivity of chlorination and bromination was almost completely switched from C6 to C7 as in RebH.

https://openalex.org/W2903703987,"The gene encoding the GTPase KRAS is frequently mutated in pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancers. The KRAS fraction in the plasma membrane (PM) correlates with activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and subsequent cellular proliferation. Understanding KRAS's interaction with the PM is challenging given the complexity of the cellular environment. To gain insight into key components necessary for KRAS signal transduction at the PM, we used synthetic membranes such as liposomes and giant unilamellar vesicles. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, we demonstrated that KRAS and Raf-1 proto-oncogene Ser/Thr kinase (RAF1) domains interact with these membranes primarily through electrostatic interactions with negatively charged lipids reinforced by additional interactions involving phosphatidyl ethanolamine and cholesterol. We found that the RAF1 region spanning RBD through CRD (RBDCRD) interacts with the membrane significantly more strongly than the isolated RBD or CRD domains and synergizes KRAS partitioning to the membrane. We also found that calmodulin and phosphodiesterase 6 delta (PDE6δ), but not galectin3 previously proposed to directly interact with KRAS, passively sequester KRAS and prevent it from partitioning into the PM. RAF1 RBDCRD interacted with membranes preferentially at nonraft lipid domains. Moreover, a C-terminal O-methylation was crucial for KRAS membrane localization. These results contribute to a better understanding of how the KRAS–membrane interaction is tuned by multiple factors whose identification could inform drug discovery efforts to disrupt this critical interaction in diseases such as cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2904716004,"Introduction Patients with complex health care needs (PCHCN) are individuals who require numerous, costly care services and have been shown to place a heavy burden on health care resources. It has been argued that an important issue in providing value-based primary care concerns how to identify groups of patients with similar needs (who pose similar challenges) so that care teams and care delivery processes can be tailored to each patient subgroup. Our study aims to describe the most common chronic conditions and their combinations in a cohort of elderly PCHCN. Methods We focused on a cohort of PCHCN residing in an area served by a local public health unit (the “Azienda ULSS4-Veneto”) and belonging to Resource Utilization Bands 4 and 5 according to the ACG System. For each patient we extracted Expanded Diagnosis Clusters, and combined them with information available from Rx-MGs diagnoses. For the present work we focused on 15 diseases/disorders, analyzing their combinations as dyads and triads. Latent class analysis was used to elucidate the patterns of the morbidities considered in the PCHCN. Results Five disease clusters were identified: one concerned metabolic-ischemic heart diseases; one was labelled as neurological and mental disorders; one mainly comprised cardiac diseases such as congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation; one was largely associated with respiratory conditions; and one involved neoplasms. Conclusions Our study showed specific common associations between certain chronic diseases, shedding light on the patterns of multimorbidity often seen in PCHCN. Studying these patterns in more depth may help to better organize the intervention needed to deal with these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2903764817,"This RCT investigated the effect on children of integrating physical activity (PA) into math lessons. The primary outcome was math achievement and the secondary outcomes were executive functions, fitness and body mass index. Twelve Danish schools were randomized to either an intervention group or a control group. A total of 505 children with mean age 7.2 ± 0.3 years were enrolled in the study. Change in math achievement was measured by a 45-minute standardized math test, change in executive function by a modified Eriksen flanker task, aerobic fitness by the Andersen intermittent shuttle-run test, and body mass index by standard procedures. PA during the math lessons and total PA (including time spent outside school) were assessed using accelerometry (ActiGraph, GT3X and GT3X+). Children in the intervention group improved their math score by 1.2 (95% CI 0.3; 2.1) more than the control group (p = 0.011) and had a tendency towards a higher change in physical activity level during math lessons of 120,4 counts/min (95% CI -9.0;249.8.2, p = 0.067). However, the intervention did not affect executive functions, fitness or body mass index. Participation in a 9-month PA intervention (from 2012–2013) improved math achievement among elementary school children. If replicated, these findings would suggest that implementation of physical activity in school settings could lead to higher academic achievement."
https://openalex.org/W2903587933,"Introduction Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy [DCM] often presents with non-specific symptoms and signs. It progresses insidiously and leads to permanent neurological dysfunction. Decompressive surgery can halt disease progression, however significant delays in diagnosis result in increased disability and limit recovery. The nature of early DCM symptoms is unknown, moreover it has been suggested incomplete examination contributes to missed diagnosis. This study examines how DCM is currently assessed, if assessment differs between stages of healthcare, and whether this influences patient management. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Cervical MRI scans (N = 1123) at a tertiary neurosciences center, over a single year, were screened for patients with DCM (N = 43). Signs, symptoms, and disease severity of DCM were extracted from patient records. Patients were considered at 3 phases of clinical assessment: primary care, secondary care, and surgical assessment. Results Upper limb paraesthesia and urinary dysfunction were consistently the most and least prevalent symptoms respectively. Differences between assessing clinicians were present in the reporting of: limb pain (p<0.005), objective limb weakness (p = 0.01), hyperreflexia (p<0.005), Hoffmann reflex (p<0.005), extensor plantar reflex (p = 0.007), and lower limb spasticity (p<0.005). Pathological reflexes were least frequently assessed by primary care doctors. Conclusion DCM assessment varies significantly between assessors. Reporting of key features of DCM is especially low in primary care. Incomplete assessment may hinder early diagnosis and referral to spinal surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2904259759,"β-Adrenergic stimulation of adipose tissue increases mitochondrial density and activity (browning) that are associated with improved whole-body metabolism. Whereas chronically elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in adipose tissue contribute to insulin resistance, transient ROS elevation stimulates physiological processes such as adipogenesis. Here, using a combination of biochemical and cell and molecular biology–based approaches, we studied whether ROS or antioxidant treatment affects β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) stimulation–induced adipose tissue browning. We found that β3-AR stimulation increases ROS levels in cultured adipocytes, but, unexpectedly, pretreatment with different antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine, vitamin E, or GSH ethyl ester) did not prevent this ROS increase. Using fluorescent probes, we discovered that the antioxidant treatments instead enhanced β3-AR stimulation–induced mitochondrial ROS production. This pro-oxidant effect of antioxidants was, even in the absence of β3-AR stimulation, associated with decreased oxygen consumption and increased lactate production in adipocytes. We observed similar antioxidant effects in WT mice: N-acetylcysteine blunted β3-AR stimulation–induced browning of white adipose tissue and reduced mitochondrial activity in brown adipose tissue even in the absence of β3-AR stimulation. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine increased the levels of peroxiredoxin 3 and superoxide dismutase 2 in adipose tissue, indicating increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. We interpret this negative impact of antioxidants on oxygen consumption in vitro and adipose tissue browning in vivo as essential adaptations that prevent a further increase in mitochondrial ROS production. In summary, these results suggest that chronic antioxidant supplementation can produce a paradoxical increase in oxidative stress associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2905477965,"Retinoic acid receptor responder 1 (RARRES1) is silenced in many cancers and is differentially expressed in metabolism associated diseases, such as hepatic steatosis, hyperinsulinemia and obesity. Here we report a novel function of RARRES1 in metabolic reprogramming of epithelial cells. Using non-targeted LC-MS, we discovered that RARRES1 depletion in epithelial cells caused a global increase in lipid synthesis. RARRES1-depleted cells rewire glucose metabolism by switching from aerobic glycolysis to glucose-dependent de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Treatment with fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor, C75, reversed the effects of RARRES1 depletion. The increased DNL in RARRES1-depleted normal breast and prostate epithelial cells proved advantageous to the cells during starvation, as the increase in fatty acid availability lead to more oxidized fatty acids (FAO), which were used for mitochondrial respiration. Expression of RARRES1 in several common solid tumors is also contextually correlated with expression of fatty acid metabolism genes and fatty acid-regulated transcription factors. Pathway enrichment analysis led us to determine that RARRES1 is regulated by peroxisome proliferating activated receptor (PPAR) signaling. These findings open up a new avenue for metabolic reprogramming and identify RARRES1 as a potential target for cancers and other diseases with impaired fatty acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2904648120,"Purpose To evaluate the utility of photoacoustic imaging in measuring changes in renal oxygen saturation after ischemia-induced acute kidney injury, and to compare these measurements with histological findings and serum levels of kidney function. Material and Methods Acute kidney injury was induced by clamping the left renal pedicle in C57Bl/6 mice, with a 35-min ischemic period used to induce mild renal injury (14 mice) and a 50-min period for severe injury (13 mice). The oxygen saturation was measured before induction, and at 5 time-points over the first 48 h after induction, starting at 4 h after induction. Oxygen saturation, histological score, kidney volume, and the 24 h creatinine clearance rate and serum blood urea nitrogen were also measured on day 28. Between-group differences were evaluated using a Mann-Whitney U-test and Dunn’s multiple comparisons. The association between oxygen saturation and measured variables was evaluated using Spearman’s correlation. A receiver operator characteristic curve was constructed from oxygen saturation values at 24 h after heminephrectomy to predict chronic renal function. Results The oxygen saturation was higher in the mild than severe renal injury group at 24 h after induction (73.7% and 66.9%, respectively, P<0.05). Between-group comparison on day 28 revealed a higher kidney volume (P = 0.007), lower tubular injury (P<0.001), lower serum level of blood urea nitrogen level (P = 0.016), and lower 24 h creatinine clearance rate (P = 0.042) in the mild compared with the severe injury group. The oxygen saturation at 24 h correlated with the 24 h creatinine clearance rate (P = 0.036) and serum blood urea nitrogen (P<0.001) on day 28, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.825. Conclusion Oxygen saturation, measured by photoacoustic imaging at 24 h after acute kidney injury can predict the extent of subsequent histological alterations in the kidney early after injury."
https://openalex.org/W2905154903,"Rivastigmine (Riv) is a potent and selective cholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase, AChE and butyrylcholinesterase, BuChE) inhibitor developed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To elucidate whether Riv causes neuronal differentiation, we examined its effect on nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. At concentrations of 0–100 μM, Riv was non-toxic in PC12 cells. Riv caused dose-dependent (10–100 μM) enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, which was completely inhibited by the TrkA antagonist GW-441756. By contrast, Riv-mediated enhancement of neurite outgrowth was not blocked by the acetylcholine receptor antagonists, scopolamine and hexamethonium. However, the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) antagonist NE-100 and sigma-2 receptor (Sig-2R) antagonist SM-21 each blocked about half of the Riv-mediated enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, the simultaneous application of NE-100 and SM-21 completely blocked the enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by Riv. These findings suggest that both Sig-1R and Sig-2R play important roles in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth through TrkA and that Riv may contribute to neuronal repair via Sig-1R and Sig-2R in AD therapy."

The biomarkers were measured in rectal biopsies at baseline and after one year of follow up, using automated immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis. In the vitamin D plus calcium group relative to control, in the crypt differentiation zone (upper 40% of crypts), mib-1 expression decreased 24% (P = 0.28); p21 expression alone and relative to mib-1 expression increased 29% (P = 0.06) and 73% (P = 0.06), respectively; and bax expression relative to mib-1 expression increased 58% (P = 0.21). The estimated vitamin D alone treatment effects were similar but of lesser magnitudes, and those for calcium alone were mixed. All estimated treatment effects on bcl-2 expression were close to the null. These pilot study results support further investigation of whether 1) vitamin D and calcium promote colorectal epithelial cell differentiation, reduce proliferation, and promote apoptosis in the normal-appearing human colorectal mucosa, 2) vitamin D and calcium act as chemopreventive agents against colorectal neoplasms, and 3) mib-1, p21, and bax are potential ""treatable"", pre-neoplastic, biomarkers of risk for colorectal neoplasms."

The transcription factor Nrf1 (also called NFE2L1) counteracts proteotoxic stress by inducing transcription of proteasome subunit genes, resulting in the restoration of proteasome activity. Further understanding of the Nrf1 pathway is therefore of interest in both neurodegeneration, where proteasome activity could be enhanced, and cancer, where suppression of this pathway could potentiate the cell-killing effect mediated by proteasome inhibitor drugs. Here, to identify novel regulators of Nrf1, we performed an RNAi screen in an engineered cell line, reporting on Nrf1 transcriptional activity. In addition to validating known regulators, we discovered that the AAA+ ATPase RUVBL1 is necessary for Nrf1's transcriptional activity. Given that RUVBL1 is part of different multisubunit complexes that play key roles in transcription, we dissected this phenomenon further and found that the TIP60 chromatin-regulatory complex is essential for Nrf1-dependent transcription of proteasome genes. Consistent with these observations, Nrf1, RUVBL1, and TIP60 proteins were co-recruited to the promoter regions of proteasome genes after proteasome inhibitor treatments. More importantly, depletion of RUVBL1 or TIP60 in various cancer cells sensitized them to cell death induced by proteasome inhibition.

Protein homeostasis or proteostasis refers to the sum total of highly regulated and often interconnected cellular processes that include synthesis, folding, and destruction of proteins (1Lindquist S.L.

The ubiquitin–proteasome system plays a pivotal role in proteostasis by orchestrating protein degradation. A central component of the ubiquitin–proteasome system is the 26S proteasome, a multisubunit molecular machine with proteolytic activity that is directly responsible for degrading its protein substrates, which are often tagged with polyubiquitin signals. The 26S proteasome, in turn, is composed of a 20S core that serves as the main proteolytic chamber and is capped on one or both ends by the 19S regulatory particle (2Rousseau A. Bertolotti A.

In response to proteasome inhibition, the Nrf1 pathway is activated, leading to de novo synthesis of proteasome subunit genes, resulting in “bounce back” or recovery of proteasome activity (4Radhakrishnan S.K.

Apart from responding to proteotoxic stress, Nrf1 is also responsible for basal transcription of proteasome genes in a tissue-specific manner. Nrf1-deficient mouse neuronal cells display accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and decreased proteasome activity concomitant with a reduction in proteasome gene expression (11Lee C.S. Lee C.

A similar phenomenon is also evident in hepatocytes from mice that have a liver-specific knockout of Nrf1 (12Lee C.S. Ho D.V. Chan J.Y. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 1 regulates expression of proteasome genes in hepatocytes and protects against endoplasmic reticulum stress and steatosis in mice.FEBS J. 2013; 280 (23702335): 3609-362010.1111/febs.12350Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). From a molecular perspective, Nrf1 is co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are:ERendoplasmic reticulumAREantioxidant response elementhPGKhuman phosphoglycerate kinaseLucluciferaseCFZcarfilzomibIPimmunoprecipitation. membrane in such a way that only a small portion of its N terminus protrudes into the cytosol, whereas the bulk of its polypeptide, including the transcriptional activation and DNA-binding domains, is embedded in the ER lumen. Thus, Nrf1 depends on the action of the ATPase p97 to be retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side either to be constitutively degraded in the absence of proteotoxic stress or activated and mobilized to the nucleus when cells are subjected to proteasome inhibition (13Radhakrishnan S.K. den Besten W. Deshaies R.J. p97-dependent retrotranslocation and proteolytic processing govern formation of active Nrf1 upon proteasome inhibition.eLife. 2014; 3 (24448410): e0185610.7554/eLife.01856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Nrf1 also requires its deglycosylation, which is mediated by a p97-associated N-glycanase enzyme, NGLY1 (14Tomlin F.M. Gerling-Driessen U.I.M. Liu Y.-C. Flynn R.A. Vangala J.R.

The protease involved in this process was recently discovered to be DDI2, a member of the aspartic family of proteases (15Koizumi S. Irie T. Hirayama S. Sakurai Y. Yashiroda H. Naguro I. Ichijo H. Hamazaki J. Murata S.

One way to make this therapy more effective would be to devise strategies to block the Nrf1 pathway, thus impairing the ability of the cancer cells to recover their proteasome activity in response to inhibition of the proteasome. In support of this notion, a recent study demonstrated that attenuation of Nrf1 activation via p97 inhibition increased the efficacy of proteasome inhibitor drugs in multiple myeloma models (18Le Moigne R. Aftab B.T. Djakovic S. Dhimolea E. Valle E. Murnane M. King E.M. Soriano F. Menon M.K. Wu Z.Y. Wong S.T. Lee G.J. Yao B. Wiita A.P.

On the flip side, in certain proteinopathies, especially neurodegenerative diseases where the neurons display ubiquitinated protein aggregates, indicative of proteasome dysfunction, there could be interest in enhancing the Nrf1 pathway to directly increase proteasomal capacity (3Schmidt M. Finley D. Regulation of proteasome activity in health and disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843 (23994620): 13-2510.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.08.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Thus, further understanding the Nrf1–proteasome axis could help pave the way for devising novel therapeutic agents targeted at different human diseases. In this study, we identified a requirement for the TIP60 chromatin-modifying complex in enabling Nrf1-mediated proteasomal gene expression in response to inhibition of the proteasome. This expands our view of the inner workings of Nrf1-mediated transcription and could offer strategies to manipulate this pathway in human diseases. To identify factors that regulate Nrf1 activity under conditions of proteasome inhibition, we constructed a cell-based screening system in WT NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. This cell line was engineered to stably express firefly luciferase under the control of 8x antioxidant response element (ARE; the sequence to which Nrf1 is known to bind (8Biswas M. Chan J.Y. Role of Nrf1 in antioxidant response element-mediated gene expression and beyond.Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2009; 244 (19665035): 16-2010.1016/j.taap.2009.07.034Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)) repeats coupled to a minimal promoter. In addition, as a control, these cells also expressed Renilla luciferase driven by the human phosphoglycerate kinase (hPGK) promoter (Fig. 1A). The resultant screening system is referred to as WT 8xARE-Luc, whereas a similar system in an NIH-3T3 Nrf1-deficient background (19Vangala J.R. Sotzny F. Krüger E. Deshaies R.J. Radhakrishnan S.K. Nrf1 can be processed and activated in a proteasome-independent manner.Curr. Biol. 2016; 26 (27676297): R834-R83510.1016/j.cub.2016.08.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) is referred to as Nrf1−/− 8xARE-Luc. We then confirmed the status of Nrf1 in these two cell lines. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (CFZ) resulted in the accumulation of Nrf1 p120 (precursor) and p110 (processed form; transcriptionally active) in the WT 8xARE-Luc but not in Nrf1−/− 8xARE-Luc cell line, as expected (Fig. 1B). More importantly, although the WT 8xARE-Luc cells showed a dose-dependent increase in normalized luciferase activity (ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase values) in response to CFZ, the Nrf1−/− 8xARE-Luc cell line showed no such increase (Fig. 1C), implying that this effect is Nrf1-dependent. In light of our previous study, which demonstrated a strict reliance of Nrf1 function on p97 ATPase activity (13Radhakrishnan S.K. den Besten W. Deshaies R.J. p97-dependent retrotranslocation and proteolytic processing govern formation of active Nrf1 upon proteasome inhibition.eLife. 2014; 3 (24448410): e0185610.7554/eLife.01856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used NMS-873, an inhibitor of p97 (20Magnaghi P.

NMS-873 was able to effectively attenuate CFZ-induced increased luciferase activity in the WT 8xARE-Luc cell line (Fig. 1D), additionally validating our screening system. Next, we used our WT 8xARE-Luc cell system in an RNAi screen where we used a focused library of siRNAs that target various epigenetic regulators and possible Nrf1 pathway influencers gleaned from public databases and the literature (8Biswas M. Chan J.Y. Role of Nrf1 in antioxidant response element-mediated gene expression and beyond.Toxicol. Appl.

As positive controls, we used Nrf1-specific siRNAs and also siRNAs targeting known Nrf1 regulators such as p97 and the protease DDI2. In the screen, we found that depletion of any of the controls (Nrf1, p97, or DDI2) strongly attenuated the CFZ-induced increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 1E). Of the other test genes in the library, we observed that knockdown of RUVBL1 elicited an effect that was quite similar to the ones produced by the three positive control siRNAs (Fig. 1E). The results from the entire screen are listed in Table S1. RUVBL1 (also called Pontin/TIP49) and the related protein RUVBL2 (also called Reptin/TIP48) are AAA+ ATPases (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) that most often occur together and participate in various cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation (23Mao Y.Q. Houry W.A. The Role of Pontin and Reptin in cellular physiology and cancer etiology.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 (28884116): 5810.3389/fmolb.2017.00058Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Given that we identified RUVBL1 as a “hit” in our screen, it most likely is involved in Nrf1-mediated transcriptional activation of its target genes. To further confirm the involvement of RUVBL1 in the Nrf1 pathway, we examined the changes in proteasome gene transcription in response to CFZ treatment in control and siRUVBL1-treated NIH3T3 cells. Although the control cells displayed a functional Nrf1 pathway by up-regulating representative proteasome subunit genes as expected, cells with RUVBL1 depletion were profoundly defective in this response (Fig. 1F). Under these circumstances, we did not see a significant difference in Nrf1 protein levels or its ability to be processed into the p110 form after RUVBL1 knockdown (Fig. 1G). Taken together, these results reinforce a model where RUVBL1 could regulate the transcriptional activity of Nrf1, as seen for certain other transcription factors such as c-Myc, β-catenin, E2F1, NF-κB, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) (23Mao Y.Q. Houry W.A. The Role of Pontin and Reptin in cellular physiology and cancer etiology.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 (28884116): 5810.3389/fmolb.2017.00058Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the control immunoblots, to verify knockdown efficiency in this experiment, we noticed that, apart from RUVBL1, the protein levels of RUVBL2 were also attenuated in lysates derived from siRUVBL1-treated samples (Fig. 1G). This is consistent with previous observations where depletion of either factor results in a concomitant decrease in the other, in line with the notion that RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 together need to be incorporated into a hexameric complex to attain stability (24Venteicher A.S.

To rule out any cell type-specific bias, we tested other cell lines of various origin: HCT116 colon cancer, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, and MIA-PaCa2 pancreatic cancer cells. Regardless of the cell type, we observed that, although proteasome inhibition up-regulated the transcript levels of the tested proteasome genes, depletion of RUVBL1 (Fig. S1) severely compromised this effect (Fig. 2A). Similar to our observation with NIH-3T3 cells, in all of these cancer cell lines, depletion of RUVBL1 resulted in decreases in the protein levels of both RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 (Fig. 2B). Although, in some instances, RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 act as a heterohexamer to regulate gene transcription (27Gnatovskiy L. Mita P. Levy D.E. The human RVB complex is required for efficient transcription of type I interferon-stimulated genes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33 (23878400): 3817-382510.1128/MCB.01562-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), in most cases these proteins are part of multisubunit complexes with roles in transcription (23Mao Y.Q. Houry W.A. The Role of Pontin and Reptin in cellular physiology and cancer etiology.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 (28884116): 5810.3389/fmolb.2017.00058Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The most prominent RUVBL1/2-containing complexes are INO80, SRCAP, TIP60, and R2TP (Fig. 3A). To test whether one or more of these complexes could be involved in mediating Nrf1-dependent transcription under proteotoxic stress, we proceeded to deplete a key component in each complex (the INO80 subunit in the INO80 complex, the SRCAP subunit in the SRCAP complex, the TIP60 subunit in the TIP60 complex, and the PIH1 subunit in the R2TP complex, all of which are indicated by arrows in Fig. 3A) in the WT 8xARE-Luc cell line. We observed that depletion of TIP60, but not any of the other subunits tested (Fig. S2), recapitulated the effect of RUVBL1 knockdown in blocking the proteasome inhibitor–mediated increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 3B). Likewise, when we measured transcriptional up-regulation of proteasome genes in response to proteasome inhibition, depletion of TIP60 attenuated this response, similar to what was observed with RUVBL1 depletion (Fig. 3C). Taken together, our results attribute a critical role of the TIP60 complex in Nrf1-dependent transcriptional response to proteotoxic stress. Interestingly, in our control immunoblots, we observed that depletion of RUVBL1 also decreased TIP60 and, to a certain extent, INO80 and PIH1 protein levels (Fig. 3D). This is consistent with an earlier study that indicated that the RUVBL1/2 complex is essential for assembly of a functional TIP60 complex (28Jha S. Gupta A. Dar A. Dutta A. RVBs are required for assembling a functional TIP60 complex.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33 (23297341): 1164-117410.1128/MCB.01567-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

To verify this hypothesis, we compared the ARE-containing promoter regions of the Nrf1 target genes PSMA7, PSMB7, and PSMD12 in WT and Nrf1−/− NIH3T3 cells using ChIP assays. Under the condition of proteasome inhibition with CFZ, we could observe recruitment of Nrf1 in the promoter regions of proteasome genes in WT but not Nrf1−/− cells, as expected (Fig. 4A). Importantly, we observed a similar trend for RUVBL1 and TIP60 subunits, implying Nrf1-dependent recruitment of these factors to the proteasome gene promoters. Consistent with this notion, we were also able to detect interaction between Nrf1 and RUVBL1/2 using co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 4B). Our previous work conclusively demonstrated a cellular requirement for Nrf1 in recovering from inhibition of the proteasome (4Radhakrishnan S.K. Lee C.S. Young P. Beskow A. Chan J.Y. Deshaies R.J. Transcription factor Nrf1 mediates the proteasome recovery pathway after proteasome inhibition in mammalian cells.Mol.

To verify whether this effect is recapitulated in cells deficient in RUVBL1 or TIP60, we performed proteasome recovery assays (Fig. 5A). Here we exploited the differences in the nature of binding of proteasome inhibitors to the active site of the proteasome. Although MG132 is a completely reversible proteasome inhibitor, CFZ binds to the proteasome active site in a covalent/irreversible manner. When cells are treated with MG132 briefly and then washed off, recovery of the proteasome activity is achieved by simple dissociation of the drug from the proteasome active site as well as via the action of the Nrf1 pathway during the time when the proteasome was inhibited. In the case of CFZ, given its covalent binding to the proteasome, the only way for the cells to recover after drug washout is by invoking the Nrf1 pathway to synthesize new proteasomes. Thus, impairing Nrf1 function in this context will severely undermine the ability of the cells to recover proteasome activity (4Radhakrishnan S.K. Lee C.S. Young P. Beskow A. Chan J.Y. Deshaies R.J. Transcription factor Nrf1 mediates the proteasome recovery pathway after proteasome inhibition in mammalian cells.Mol.

To test these predictions in our study, we compared WT NIH-3T3 cells with siRUVBL1- or siTIP60-transfected cells for their relative ability to recover proteasome activity after pulse treatment with MG132 or CFZ at appropriate concentrations to achieve about 90% inhibition of proteasome activity in 1 h. Following drug washout, we found that cells depleted of RUVBL1 or TIP60 were able to recover their proteasome activity after MG132 pulse treatment but were partially impaired in their ability to do so when CFZ was employed (Fig. 5B). These results underscore the importance of RUVBL1 and TIP60 in mediating the recovery of proteasome activity after inhibition of the proteasome. Irresolvable proteotoxic stress could lead to cell death, particularly in cancer cells, which are thought to be over-reliant on proteasome function (34Frankland-Searby S. Bhaumik S.R.

https://openalex.org/W2904276549,"Background Metastasis and multiple myeloma are common malignant bone marrow lesions which may be difficult to distinguish because of similar imaging findings. The purpose of this study was to determine the value of adding diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to standard MR imaging to differentiate multiple myeloma from metastasis. Methods 25 patients with metastasis and 18 patients with multiple myeloma underwent 3T MR imaging with DWI (b = 0, 800 s/mm2) were enrolled. They all had pathologically confirmed bone lesions and were in a treatment naïve state. Two readers who were blind of final diagnosis measured the average ADC (ADCav) and minimum ADC (ADCmin) on the DWI. They then estimated the diagnosis, based on the standard MR imaging and measured ADC values. Another reader performed histogram analysis on the whole tumor volume and obtained mean ADC (ADCvol), standard deviation (SDvol), skewness, and kurtosis. Comparison of the obtained values from DWI was performed by the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with areas under the curve (AUC) was used to obtain the cut off values and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the two readers. Results ADCav, ADCmin, and ADCvol of multiple myeloma were significantly lower than those of metastasis: ADCav, 752 μm2/sec versus 1081 μm2/sec; ADCmin, 704 μm2/sec vs 835 μm2/sec; ADCvol 761 μm2/sec vs 1184 μm2/sec (p < .001). In histogram analysis, ADC values of multiple myeloma showed narrow distribution than metastasis: SDvol, 144 vs 257 (p < .001). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve was significantly higher with additive DWI than standard MR alone: 0.762 vs 0.953; 0.706 vs 0.950 (p < .05) for two readers. Conclusions This study suggested that the addition of axial DWI to standard MR imaging can be helpful to diagnose multiple myeloma from metastasis at 3T."

Joinpoint regression analysis was used to calculate the 5-year incidence rates of metachronous SPLC per 100 000 population. Related risk factors of the survivors who developed MSPLC during five years were identified through logistic regression analysis, followed by establishment of risk prediction nomogram. Discrimination (C-index), calibration and decision analysis were further performed to assess the validation and clinical net benefit of risk prediction nomogram.A total of 1412 survivors with lung cancer developed MSPLC during five years, with 3546 per 100 000 population of age-adjusted 5-year incidence. Age, histology, tumor stage, and radiation were recognized as risk factors of metachronous SPLC, as indicated by logistic regression analysis. The risk prediction nomogram of metachronous SPLC harbored moderate discrimination(C-index = 0.67) and good calibration, with the risk of 0.01 to 0.11.The decision curve analysis showed that clinical net benefit of this risk prediction nomogram in a range of risk thresholds (0.01 to 0.06) was higher compared to all-screening or no-screening strategies.Collectively, the cumulative risk of metachronous SPLC of the survivors increased over time. The risk prediction nomogram was available to select high-risk survivors who should regularly undergo computed tomography screening."
https://openalex.org/W2904419521,"Introduction The aim of this trial was to investigate the effect of a continuous infusion of a neuromuscular blockade (NMB) in comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) subjects who underwent targeted temperature management (TTM). Methods In this open-label, multicenter trial, subjects resuscitated from OHCA were randomly assigned to receive either NMB (38 subjects) or placebo (43 subjects) for 24 hours. Sedatives and analgesics were given according to the protocol of each hospital during TTM. The primary outcome was serum lactate levels at 24 hours after drug infusion. The secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, a poor neurological outcome at hospital discharge, changes in lactate levels, changes in the PaO2:FiO2 ratio over time and muscle weakness as assessed by the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. Results Eighty-one subjects (NMB group: median age, 65.5 years, 30 male patients; placebo group: median age, 61.0 years, 29 male patients) were enrolled in this trial. No difference in the serum lactate level at 24 hours was observed between the NMB (2.8 [1.2–4.0]) and placebo (3.6 [1.8–5.2]) groups (p = 0.238). In-hospital mortality and a poor neurologic outcome at discharge did not differ between the two groups. No significant difference in the PaO2:FiO2 ratio over time (p = 0.321) nor the MRC score (p = 0.474) was demonstrated. Conclusions In OHCA subjects who underwent TTM, a continuous infusion of NMB did not reduce lactate levels and did not improve survival or neurological outcome at hospital discharge. Our results indicated a limited potential for the routine use of NMB during early TTM. However, this trial may be underpowered to detect clinical differences, and future research should be conducted."

Aim To report key quality indicators and basic statistics about cervical screening in Sweden. Methods We collected individual level data on all cervical cytologies, histopathologies, human papillomavirus tests and all invitations for cervical screening in Sweden during 2013–2016. Results There were over 2,278,000 cervical samples collected in Sweden in 2014–2016. Organized samples (resulting from an invitation) constituted 69% of samples. The screening test coverage of all resident women aged 23–60 was 82%. The coverage has slowly increased for >10 years. There is large variability between counties (from 71% to 92%) over time. There were 25,725 women with high-grade lesions in cytology during 2013–2015. Only 96% of these women had a follow-up histopathology within a year. Cervical cancer incidence showed an increasing trend. Conclusion Key quality indicators such as population coverage and follow-up rates were stable or improving, but there was nevertheless an unexplained cervical cancer increase."
https://openalex.org/W2950671607,"Acute myeloid leukemia with mutated nucleophosmin (NPMc+ AML) forms a distinct AML subgroup with better prognosis which can potentially be associated with immune response against the mutated nucleophosmin (NPM). As the T-cell-mediated immunity involves antigen presentation on HLA class I molecules, we hypothesized that individuals with suitable HLA type could be less prone to develop NPMc+ AML. We compared HLA class I distribution in NPMc+ AML patient cohort (398 patients from 5 centers) with the HLA allele frequencies of the healthy population and found HLA-A*02, B*07, B*40 and C*07 underrepresented in the NPMc+ AML group. Presence of B*07 or C*07:01 antigen was associated with better survival in patients without concomitant FLT3 internal tandem duplication. Candidate NPM-derived immunopeptides were found for B*40 and B*07 using prediction software tools. Our findings suggest that a T-cell-mediated immune response could actually explain better prognosis of NPMc+ patients and provide a rationale for attempts to explore the importance of immunosuppressive mechanisms in this AML subgroup."
https://openalex.org/W2903956898,"In response to the aggressive global spread of the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an accurate and accessible diagnostic tool is of high importance. CHIKV, an arthritogenic alphavirus, comprises three genotypes: East/Central/South African (ECSA), West African (WA), and Asian. A previous rapid immunochromatographic (IC) test detecting CHIKV E1 protein showed promising performance for detection of the ECSA genotype. Unfortunately, this kit exhibited lower capacity for detection of the Asian genotype, currently in circulation in the Americas, reflecting the low avidity of one of the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in this IC kit for the E1 protein of the Asian-genotype because of a variant amino acid sequence. To address this shortcoming, we set out to generate a new panel of broad-spectrum mouse anti-CHIKV mAbs using hybridoma technology. We report here the successful generation of mouse anti-CHIKV mAbs targeting CHIKV E1 and capsid proteins. These mAbs possessed broad reactivity to all three CHIKV genotypes, while most of the mAbs lacked cross-reactivity towards Sindbis, dengue, and Zika viruses. Two of the mAbs also lacked cross-reactivity towards other alphaviruses, including O'nyong-nyong, Ross River, Mayaro, Western Equine Encephalitis, Eastern Equine Encephalitis, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis viruses. In addition, another two mAbs cross-reacted weakly only with most closely related O'nyong-nyong virus. Effective diagnosis is one of the keys to disease control but to date, no antibody-based rapid IC platform for CHIKV is commercially available. Thus, the application of the mAbs characterized here in the rapid diagnostic IC kit for CHIKV detection is expected to be of great value for clinical diagnosis and surveillance purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2905277226,"Moraxella bovoculi is frequently cultured from the ocular secretions and conjunctiva of cattle with Infectious Bovine Keratoconjunctivitis (IBK). Previous work has shown that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity in this species is quite high with 81,284 SNPs identified in eight genomes representing two distinct genotypes isolated from IBK affected eyes (genotype 1) and the nasopharynx of cattle without clinical IBK signs (genotype 2), respectively. The goals of this study were to identify SNPs from a collection of geographically diverse and epidemiologically unlinked M. bovoculi strains from the eyes of IBK positive cattle (n = 183) and another from the eyes of cattle (most from a single population at a single time-point) without signs of IBK (n = 63) and to characterize the genetic diversity. Strains of both genotypes were identified from the eyes of cattle without IBK signs. Only genotype 1 strains were identified from IBK affected eyes, however, these strains were isolated before the discovery of genotype 2, and the protocol for their isolation would have preferentially selected genotype 1 M. bovoculi. The core genome comprised ~74% of the whole and contained >127,000 filtered SNPs. More than 80% of these characterize diversity within genotype 1 while 23,611 SNPs (~18%) delimit the two major genotypes. Genotype 2 strains lacked a repeats-in-toxin (RTX) putative pathogenesis factor and any of ten putative antibiotic resistance genes carried within a genomic island. Within genotype 1, prevalence of these elements was 0.85 and 0.12 respectively in strains from eyes that were IBK positive. Recombination appears to be an important source of genetic diversity for genotype 1 and undermines the utility of ribosomal-locus-based species identification. The extremely high genetic diversity in genotype 1 presents a challenge to the development of an efficacious vaccine directed against them, however, several low-diversity pilin-like genes were identified. Finally, the genotype-defining SNPs described in this study are a resource that can facilitate the development of more accurate M. bovoculi diagnostic tests."

Expression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) is regarded as a potential predictive biomarker for a gemcitabine response in some cancers. This study was conducted to investigate the association between hENT1 expression and the effects of gemcitabine on BTC cell lines and on patients with advanced BTC receiving gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. A total of four BTC cell lines, HuCCT1, SNU-478, SNU-1079, and SNU-1196, were tested. mRNA and protein expression levels of hENT1 were measured by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. Cell viability after gemcitabine treatment was measured in a chemosensitivity assay. For clinical assessment, 40 patients with unresectable or recurrent BTC who were treated with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and cisplatin (25 mg/m2) between June 2012 and May 2014 were enrolled. Among the four cell lines, SNU1196 showed the highest mRNA and protein levels of hENT1. Expression of hENT1 showed a linear correlation with the log value of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of gemcitabine. During incubation with gemcitabine, pretreatment with hENT1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in higher cell viability than that in samples pretreated with control siRNA. In a clinical evaluation, the median progression-free survival was 24 and 11 weeks among patients with strong and weak intratumoral hENT1 immunohistochemical staining (P = 0.05), and the median overall survival was 52 and 26 weeks (P = 0.15), respectively. In conclusion, this study showed that increased hENT1 expression is associated with a stronger toxic effect of gemcitabine on BTC cell lines. The clinical outcomes in this study suggest that increased intratumoral hENT1 immunohistochemical staining is a possible biomarker predicting better therapeutic effects of gemcitabine on patients with advanced BTC. Further studies are needed to determine the precise role of hENT1 in BTC."

In the current work, we examined the association between EDIP with cardio-metabolic risk factors, dietary antioxidant quality score (DAQs), dietary phytochemical index (DPI) and Mediterranean dietary quality index (MEDQI) in patients candidate for CABG.In the current cross-sectional study, the data obtained from Tehran- Heart Center-Coronary Outcome Measurement (THC-COM) study from 454 patients candidate for the CABG were used. Laboratory measurements including hemoglobin (Hb)-A1C, serum lipids, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hematocrit, Lp(a), telomerase activity, serum vitamin D and c-reactive protein (CRP) were measured with commercial laboratory methods. Dietary indices were measured according to the data obtained from with semi-quantitative FFQ.In the current work, patients in top quintile of EDIP had higher BMI and higher prevalence of hyperlipidemia compared with patients in lowest quintile (BMI: 28.08 ±3.68 vs 26.69 ± 3.67 and hyperlipidemia: 77.8 vs 65.5%; P < 0.05). Moreover, lower EDIP scores were accompanied with higher vitamin E (0.48 vs 0.4) and total dietary antioxidant scores (4.40 VS 4.28), higher dietary phytochemical scores (69.79 vs 58.29) and lower dietary Mediterranean quality scores (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively). In male patients, being at highest quintiles of EDIP make patients 2-5% more likely to have higher concentrations of serum cholesterol, BUN and Lp (a), and 6 to 8 times more likely to have higher creatinine and 66% more likely to have lower albumin concentrations compared with male patients in lowest quintiles. In female patients, lower HCT, higher creatinine, higher CRP concentrations and higher telomerase activity were also achieved by higher EDIP scores (P < 0.05).According to our finding, EDIP was associated with obesity, high prevalence of dyslipidemia and cardio-metabolic risk factors. Moreover, EDIP was in an inverse association with dietary antioxidant quality score and dietary phytochemical index. Therefore, EDIP could be assumed as a precise tool for estimating the CVD related risk factors among patients candidate for CABG."

Reducing this resistance might shed light on the treatment of human gastric adenocarcinoma. In this study, we examined whether glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitors can restore TRAIL responsiveness in gastric adenocarcinoma cells. The effect of two GSK-3 inhibitors, SB-415286, and LiCl, on apoptosis signaling of TRAIL in human gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines and primary gastric epithelial cells was analyzed. Both inhibitors can sensitize gastric adenocarcinoma cells, but not primary gastric epithelial cells, to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by increasing caspase-8 activity and its downstream signal transmission. Adding p53 siRNA can downregulate GSK-3 inhibitor-related sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activity. GSK-3 inhibitors strongly activate the phosphorylation of JNK. Inhibition of JNK leads to earlier and more intense apoptosis, showing that the activation of JNK may provide anti-apoptotic equilibrium of pro-apoptotic cells. Our observations indicate that GSK-3 inhibitors can sentize AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Therefore, in certain types of gastric adenocarcinoma, GSK-3 inhibitor might enhance the antitumor activity of TRAIL and mightbe a promising candidate for the treatment of certain types of gastric adenocarcinoma."

The high propensity of RD3 to aggregate in solution has prevented structural analysis. Here, we produced a highly soluble variant of human RD3 (residues 18–160) that is monomeric and can still bind and negatively regulate RetGC. The NMR solution structure of RD3 revealed an elongated backbone structure (70 Å long and 30 Å wide) consisting of a four-helix bundle with a long unstructured loop between helices 1 and 2. The structure reveals that RD3 residues previously implicated in the RetGC binding map to a localized and contiguous area on the structure, involving a loop between helices 2 and 3 and adjacent parts of helices 3 and 4. The NMR structure of RD3 was validated by mutagenesis. Introducing Trp85 or Phe29 to replace Cys or Leu, respectively, disrupts packing in the hydrophobic core and lowers RD3’s apparent affinity for RetGC1. Introducing a positive charge at the interface (Glu32 to Lys) also lowered the affinity. Conversely, introducing Val in place of Cys93 stabilized the hydrophobic core and increased the RD3 affinity for the cyclase.

Introducing Trp85 or Phe29 to replace Cys or Leu, respectively, disrupts packing in the hydrophobic core and lowers RD3’s apparent affinity for RetGC1. Introducing a positive charge at the interface (Glu32 to Lys) also lowered the affinity. Conversely, introducing Val in place of Cys93 stabilized the hydrophobic core and increased the RD3 affinity for the cyclase. The NMR structure of RD3 presented here provides a structural basis for elucidating RD3–RetGC interactions relevant for normal vision or blindness. Phototransduction in vertebrate rods and cones occurs as a result of cGMP hydrolysis by light-activated phosphodiesterase PDE6, thus causing closure of cGMP gated channels in outer segments and hyperpolarization of plasma membrane (1Arshavsky V.Y.

RD3 was first discovered as a 23-kDa protein whose deficiency caused severe photoreceptor degeneration and blindness in human patients of recessive Leber’s congenital amaurosis (LCA) and in rd3 mouse strain (10Friedman J.S.

The ability of RD3 to bind and suppress RetGC is likely required for preventing aberrant activation of the cyclase by GCAPs and is critical for the survival of photoreceptors (14Peshenko I.V.

The RetGC binding domain in RD3 was previously hypothesized to occupy the central region of the RD3 primary structure (14Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M.

A major challenge with the study of RD3 has to do with its low abundance in photoreceptors (11Azadi S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. RD3, the protein associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 12, is required for guanylate cyclase trafficking in photoreceptor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Another obstacle is the high propensity of recombinant functional RD3 to aggregate and precipitate when expressed in bacterial or eukaryotic cells (13Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Azadi S.

To overcome this obstacle, we designed a variant of RD3, in which the nonessential residues for RetGC regulation (14Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. Functional study and mapping sites for interaction with the target enzyme in retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein.J. Biol.

Three basic residues in RD3 (Lys154, Arg156, and Arg158) were replaced with Glu, and Arg68 and Ser160 were replaced with Asp, to lower the unusually high pI of RD3. These modifications prevented aggregation of the variant RD3 (named RD3d), which remained soluble at concentrations exceeding 300 μm and remained monomeric at such high concentrations (Fig. 1, B and C). The apparent SEC elution time indicated that RD3d is either a dimer or possibly a monomer, having a nonspherical shape with a gyration radius larger than a spherical globular protein of the same mass. To distinguish between these two possibilities, multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis (16Meyer M. Morgenstern B. Characterization of gelatine and acid soluble collagen by size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi angle light scattering (SEC-MALS).Biomacromolecules. 2003; 4 (14606902): 1727-173210.1021/bm0341531Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Xu X.

The SEC-MALS analysis determined a molar mass of 17 kDa for RD3d (Fig. 1C). Thus, RD3d is a monomer in solution, and the anomalous diffusion measured by SEC is caused by the nonspherical shape of the protein (16Meyer M. Morgenstern B. Characterization of gelatine and acid soluble collagen by size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi angle light scattering (SEC-MALS).Biomacromolecules. 2003; 4 (14606902): 1727-173210.1021/bm0341531Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD experiments demonstrated that RD3d is properly folded, and the RD3d CD spectrum resembles that of the full-length WT RD3 (Fig. 1D). The CD spectra of RD3d (Fig. 1D, red trace) and WT RD3 (Fig. 1D, black trace) in both cases revealed a protein secondary structure comprised of predominantly α-helix and zero β-sheet, suggesting that RD3d and WT RD3 both have similar overall secondary structure. We verified the ability of RD3d to inhibit RetGC–GCAP complex activity using a standardized in vitro assay (14Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. Functional study and mapping sites for interaction with the target enzyme in retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein.J. Biol.

RD3d retained the ability to completely suppress activation of the cyclase in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, albeit with higher than WT EC50 (36 ± 10 nm versus 3 ± 0.6 nm, n = 3, p = 0.005, Student’s t test). However, we also found it important that RD3d, like WT RD3, still suppressed the cyclase activity within the submicromolar range, in stark contrast to a full-length RD3 mutant in which the sequence of the five central amino acid residues at positions 93–98, a part of the “hot spot” for the cyclase regulation, was scrambled (14Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. Functional study and mapping sites for interaction with the target enzyme in retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein.J. Biol.

We further tested whether RD3d could form a complex with RetGC1 in living cells (Fig. 2, B and C). The RetGC loses its ability to maintain active complex with regulatory proteins when extracted from the membrane (18Koch K.W. Purification and identification of photoreceptor guanylate cyclase.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (1673683): 8634-8637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, its binding with GCAPs and RD3 can be directly observed in HEK293 cells when fluorescently tagged RetGC1 anchors these cytosolic proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes (15Peshenko I.V.

The respective Pearson’s correlation coefficients (PCC) for the two fluorescent tags distribution over the entire cell was 0.83 ± 0.07 (mean ± S.D.), 24 cells, and 0.069 ± 0.11, 18 cells (p < 0.0001, unpaired t test assuming unequal variance); note that PCC ≤ 0.5 indicates the lack of co-localization, whereas PCC = 1.0 is the theoretical limit value for complete co-localization (21Zinchuk V. Zinchuck O. Quantitative colocalization analysis of confocal fluorescence microscopy images.Curr. Prot. Cell Biol. 2008; 39: 4191-419510.1002/0471143030.cb0419s39Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To summarize, despite the lower affinity for the cyclase, the essential regulatory properties of RD3—to bind and inhibit RetGC at submicromolar range—were preserved in RD3d. Therefore, we reasoned that the main RD3 biological function was retained in the RD3d structure. NMR spectral assignments for RD3d were reported previously (Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank accession number 27305) (22Lim S. Cudia D. Yu Q. Peshenko I. Dizhoor A.M. Ames J.B. Chemical shift assignments of retinal degeneration 3 protein (RD3).Biomol. NMR Assign. 2018; 12 (29327102): 167-17010.1007/s12104-018-9802-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These previous assignments were used in the current study to obtain NMR-derived structural restraints from NOESY and residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data. NMR structures were then calculated on the basis of distance restraints derived from analysis of NOESY (23Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Determining the structures of large proteins and protein complexes by NMR.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2 (9818180): 564-57010.1016/S1367-5931(98)80084-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and long-range orientational restraints derived from RDC data (24Tjandra N. Bax A.

The last 20 residues at the C terminus (Arg140–Asp160) are unstructured and dynamically disordered. The 10 lowest-energy NMR structures are overlaid in Fig. 3A, and the structural statistics are summarized in Table 1. The overall precision of the NMR ensemble is expressed by a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.55 Å calculated from the coordinates of the main-chain atoms. The quality of the NMR structures were assessed using PROCHECK-NMR (25Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M.

NMR. 1996; 8 (9008363): 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar), which shows that 96.8% of the residues occur in the allowed or favorable regions from the Ramachandran plot. RD3d forms an elongated overall structure (70 Å long by 30 Å wide) with a four-helix bundle (helix α1, Pro21–Val51; helix α2, Pro75–Lys87; helix α3, Pro90–Gln107; and helix α4, Val111–Thr139) shown in Fig. 3A. Helices α1 and α2 are connected by a long unstructured loop (residues Arg52–Ser74). Helices α1 and α4 are each quite long (27 Å) and interact with one another in an anti-parallel fashion that gives rise to a very long end-to-end distance in the structure. The elongated shape of the RD3d NMR structure can explain the unusually large radius of gyration observed for RD3 by SEC (Fig. 1C).Table 1NMR structural statistics for RD3NMR restraintsValue (restraint violation)Short-range NOEs727 (0.0 ± 0.0)Long-range NOEs216 (0.0 ± 0.0)Hydrogen bonds144 (not used in water refinement)Dihedral angles172 (0.1 ± 0.3)1DHN RDC72 (0.0 ± 0.0)RDC Q-factor0.289Coordinate precision (Å)aCoordinate precision was calculated for residues 4–34 and 58–122.

Open table in a new tab A four-helix bundle in RD3d is stabilized by a core of hydrophobic residues (Fig. 3B). Residues on the inner surface of helices α1 (residues Leu29 and Leu33), α3 (Phe100), and α4 (Val114, Phe118, and Leu122) each point inward toward the hydrophobic core (see yellow dotted lines in Fig. 2B). The Leu81 side chain from helix α2 also makes contacts in the hydrophobic core (Fig. 2B). The Phe118 side chain is located in the center of the core and connects the four helices together. Multiple NOE contacts to the Phe118 side chain (yellow dotted lines) reveal hydrophobic contacts that may stabilize the four-helix bundle. The N-terminal end of helix α2 (residues Pro75–Gln80) projects away from the hydrophobic core and is mostly solvent-exposed. The solvent-exposed ends of helices α1 (residues Glu39–Val51) and α4 (residues Glu124–Thr139) are stabilized by a series of salt-bridge interactions (Fig. 3C). These salt bridges in α1 (see residues Glu39, Lys42, and Glu46 in Fig. 3C) and in α4 (Glu124, Arg128, Glu132, and His136 in Fig. 3C) help to rigidify the solvent-exposed ends of these helices, which creates the long end-to-end distance in the elongated structure. A space-filling representation of the RD3 structure reveals a highly negatively charged surface on one side (Fig. 3D), where a number of negatively charged glutamate residues (Glu106, Glu108, Glu110, Glu113, Glu127, Glu132, and Glu134) are all clustered in an extended localized patch on the protein surface. Whether or not any of them serve to make extensive electrostatic contacts with RetGC remains to be determined in future studies. Previous mutational analysis on RD3 has identified several mutations that weaken RD3 binding to RetGC (14Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M.

These RetGC-sensitive residues in RD3 are located in discontinuous stretches throughout the amino acid sequence (red letters in Fig. 1A) but are localized spatially in close proximity to one another near the center of the NMR structure (highlighted red in Fig. 4). RD3 residues at each end of the elongated NMR structure (highlighted blue in Fig. 4) are not essential for the RetGC inhibitory binding (14Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. Functional study and mapping sites for interaction with the target enzyme in retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (27471269): 19713-1972310.1074/jbc.M116.742288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Many of the residues affecting RetGC regulation are solvent-exposed (see His89, Cys93, Pro95, Ile97, Arg99, Arg101, Gln102, and Ser120 in Fig. 4), consistent with these residues being able to make direct contact with RetGC. By contrast, a few of the RetGC-sensitive residues are buried in the hydrophobic core (Ile88, Ala96, Phe100,and Leu122), suggesting that these residues are inaccessible and must not make any regulatory contact with RetGC. Future studies are needed to pinpoint and map all the particular residues on the surface of RD3 that are clustered to form a binding site for RetGC. To further test in a functional assay the NMR structure derived from the RD3d, we introduced mutations in unmodified full-length RD3, aiming at altering the interactions within the α-helical bundle portion containing the interface for binding to RetGC. It has been previously shown that the sequences of a majority of short regions in RD3 primary structure (marked in blue in Fig. 4) could be scrambled without loss of RD3 ability to bind and inhibit RetGC1 (14Peshenko I.V. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. Functional study and mapping sites for interaction with the target enzyme in retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein.J. Biol.

To affect the interactions between the parts of the α-helical bundle, rather than the surface-exposed side chains involved in interaction with RetGC, we selected two hydrophilic residues, Cys85 and Cys93, which according to the NMR structure are embedded in a hydrophobic core formed by interacting residues from helices α3 and α4 and only minimally exposed to solvent (Figure 4, Figure 5A). We surmised that the replacement of Cys85 with Trp would make less favorable the formation of a tight structure involving helices α2 and α3 and the residues in the loop 2/3, thus affecting the interface with the cyclase. We reasoned that Trp85, although preserving the hydrophobic interactions in that location, would be nonetheless overly large to fit into the size of the pocket containing the surrounding residues and thus tend to push them further apart from each other, likely reducing the RD3 affinity for the target enzyme. Indeed, the dose dependence of the RetGC1–GCAP1 complex inhibition by the C85W RD3 (Fig. 5B) was right-shifted, with its EC50 value increased to 184 ± 21 nm (mean ± S.D.), drastically higher than the 3 ± 0.6 nm of the WT RD3 (n = 3, p = 0.005). Replacement of Leu29 with Phe was also predicted to affect the cyclase-binding interface, because the distance between the residues in that pocket were also unfavorable for accommodating the larger hydrophobic residue, albeit with a less drastic disturbance of the interactions between the interface-containing helices"

The genus distribution includes tropical South America and Central America south to Honduras. In this study, we evaluate the phylogeographic histories of Proechimys guyannensis and P. cuvieri using cytochrome b, in a densely sampled area in northeastern Amazon where both species are found in sympatry in different environments. For each species, Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis were congruent and recovered similar clades in the studied area. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using a relaxed molecular clock showed that these clusters of haplotypes diversified during Pleistocene for both species. Apparently, the large rivers of the region did not act as barriers, as some clades include specimens collected from opposite banks of Oiapoque, Araguari and Jari rivers. Bayesian skyline plot analysis showed recent demographic expansion in both species. The Pleistocene climatic changes in concert with the geologic changes in the Amazon fan probably acted as drivers in the diversification that we detected in these two spiny rats. Proechimys cuvieri and P. guyannensis show genetic structure in the eastern part of the Guiana region. Greater genetic distances observed in P. guyannensis, associated with highly structured groups, suggest that more detailed studies of systematics and ecology should be directed to this species."
https://openalex.org/W2905449720,"CbrAB is a high ranked global regulatory system exclusive of the Pseudomonads that responds to carbon limiting conditions. It has become necessary to define the particular regulon of CbrB and discriminate it from the downstream cascades through other regulatory components. We have performed in vivo binding analysis of CbrB in P. putida and determined that it directly controls the expression of at least 61 genes; 20% involved in regulatory functions, including the previously identified CrcZ and CrcY small regulatory RNAs. The remaining are porines or transporters (20%), metabolic enzymes (16%), activities related to protein translation (5%) and orfs of uncharacterised function (38%). Amongst the later, we have selected the operon PP2810-13 to make an exhaustive analysis of the CbrB binding sequences, together with those of crcZ and crcY. We describe the implication of three independent non-palindromic subsites with a variable spacing in three different targets; CrcZ, CrcY and operon PP2810-13 in the CbrAB activation. CbrB is a quite peculiar σN—dependent activator since it is barely dependent on phosphorylation for transcriptional activation. With the depiction of the precise contacts of CbrB with the DNA, the analysis of the multimerisation status and its dependence on other factors such as RpoN o IHF, we propose a model of transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2904864868,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified greater than 30 variants associated with ovarian cancer, but most of these variants were investigated in European populations. Here, we integrated GWAS and subsequent functional analyses to identify the genetic variants with potential regulatory effects. We conducted GWAS for ovarian cancer using 681 Japanese cases and 17,492 controls and found that rs137672 on 22q13.1 exhibited a strong association with a P-value of 1.05 × 10(-7) and an odds ratio of 0.573 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.466-0.703. In addition, three previously reported SNPs, i.e., rs10088218, rs9870207 and rs1400482, were validated in the Japanese population (P < 0.05) with the same risk allele as noted in previous studies. Functional studies including regulatory feature analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed two regulatory SNPs in 22q13.1, rs2072872 and rs6509, that affect the binding affinity to some nuclear proteins in ovarian cancer cells. The plausible regulatory proteins whose motifs could be affected by the allele changes of these two SNPs were also proposed. Moreover, the protective G allele of rs6509 was associated with a decreased SYNGR1 expression level in normal ovarian tissues. Our findings elucidated the regulatory variants in 22q13.1 that are associated with ovarian cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2905259002,"Bipolar cells of the retina are among the smallest neurons of the nervous system. For this reason, compared to other neurons, their delay in signaling is minimal. Additionally, the small bipolar cell surface combined with the low membrane conductance causes very little attenuation in the signal from synaptic input to the terminal. The existence of spiking bipolar cells was proven over the last two decades, but until now no complete model including all important ion channel types was published. The present study amends this and analyzes the impact of the number of model compartments on simulation accuracy. Characteristic features like membrane voltages and spike generation were tested and compared for one-, two-, four- and 117-compartment models of a macaque bipolar cell. Although results were independent of the compartment number for low membrane conductances (passive membranes), nonlinear regimes such as spiking required at least a separate axon compartment. At least a four compartment model containing the functionally different segments dendrite, soma, axon and terminal was needed for understanding signaling in spiking bipolar cells. Whereas for intracellular current application models with small numbers of compartments showed quantitatively correct results in many cases, the cell response to extracellular stimulation is sensitive to spatial variation of the electric field and accurate modeling therefore demands for a large number of short compartments even for passive membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2905583950,"Matriptase-2 (MT2) is a type-II transmembrane, trypsin-like serine protease that is predominantly expressed in the liver. It is a key suppressor for the expression of hepatic hepcidin, an iron-regulatory hormone that is induced via the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway. A current model predicts that MT2 suppresses hepcidin expression by cleaving multiple components of the induction pathway. MT2 is synthesized as a zymogen that undergoes autocleavage for activation and shedding. However, the biologically active form of MT2 and, importantly, the contributions of different MT2 domains to its function are largely unknown. Here we examined the activities of truncated MT2 that were generated by site-directed mutagenesis or Gibson assembly master mix, and found that the stem region of MT2 determines the specificity and efficacy for substrate cleavage. The transmembrane domain allowed MT2 activation after reaching the plasma membrane, and the cytoplasmic domain facilitated these processes. Further in vivo rescue studies indicated that the entire extracellular and transmembrane domains of MT2 are required to correct the low-hemoglobin, low-serum iron, and high-hepcidin status in MT2−/− mice. Unlike in cell lines, no autocleavage of MT2 was detected in vivo in the liver, implying that MT2 may also function independently of its proteolytic activity. In conjunction with our previous studies implicating the cytoplasmic domain as an intracellular iron sensor, these observations reveal the importance of each MT2 domain for MT2-mediated substrate cleavage and for its biological function.

https://openalex.org/W2903630070,"Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are higher order assemblies of RNA, RNA-binding proteins, and other proteins, that regulate the transcriptome and protect RNAs from environmental challenge. There is a diverse range of RNP granules, many cytoplasmic, which provide various levels of regulation of RNA metabolism. Here we present evidence that the yeast transcription termination factor, Nab3, is targeted to intranuclear granules in response to glucose starvation by Nab3's proline/glutamine-rich, prion-like domain (PrLD) which can assemble into amyloid in vitro. Localization to the granule is reversible and sensitive to the chemical probe 1,6 hexanediol suggesting condensation is driven by phase separation. Nab3's RNA recognition motif is also required for localization as seen for other PrLD-containing RNA-binding proteins that phase separate. Although the PrLD is necessary, it is not sufficient to localize to the granule. A heterologous PrLD that functionally replaces Nab3's essential PrLD, directed localization to the nuclear granule, however a chimeric Nab3 molecule with a heterologous PrLD that cannot restore termination function or viability, does not form granules. The Nab3 nuclear granule shows properties similar to well characterized cytoplasmic compartments formed by phase separation, suggesting that, as seen for other elements of the transcription machinery, termination factor condensation is functionally important."
https://openalex.org/W2905158338,"Deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the western Pacific are increasingly explored for potential mineral extraction. The study of the composition of the food web plays an important guiding role in the ecological protection and restoration of potential mining areas. The general picture of the nutritional sources of species should be established to assess the potential impacts of future mining activities on the biological composition and food sources. To provide basic information, we analyzed the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of the dominant macrofauna (mussels, commensal scale worms, crustaceans, gastropods, and vestimentiferans) at three different sites in the PACManus hydrothermal area and the Desmos caldera. The δ13C ratio was significantly different between species: mussels and commensal scale worms showed lighter δ13C ratios, whereas crustaceans showed heavier ratios. In terms of δ15N, mussels had the lowest values and the crustaceans had the highest values. By taking into account these stable isotope signatures, we were able to develop inferences of the food sources for vent community organisms. We found that the food web was based on various species of chemoautotrophic bacteria. Mussels appeared to rely primarily on sulfur-based endosymbionts, which use the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle and RuBisCO form I as the CO2-fixing enzyme. Commensal polychaetes mostly obtained their nutrition from their hosts. Crustacean species were omnivorous, feeding on chemosynthetic bacteria, sedimentary debris, or even animals according to the local environment. In contrast, gastropods relied mainly on symbiotic bacteria with some supplementary consumption of detritus. Vestimentiferans obtained food from symbiotic bacteria using the RuBisCO form II enzyme in the CBB cycle and may have several symbionts using different fixation pathways. Although most macrofauna relied on symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria, our study suggested a closer trophic relationship between animals. Therefore, to evaluate the potential impacts of deep sea mining, it is necessary to study the cascade effects on the food web of the whole ecosystem. Before exploiting deep-sea resources, further systematic investigations concerning the protection of deep-sea ecosystems are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2904351765,"The spore forming pathogen Bacillus anthracis is the etiologic agent of anthrax in humans and animals. It cycles through infected hosts as vegetative cells and is eventually introduced into the environment where it generates an endospore resistant to many harsh conditions. The endospores are subsequently taken up by another host to begin the next cycle. Outbreaks of anthrax occur regularly worldwide in wildlife and livestock, and the potential for human infection exists whenever humans encounter infected animals. It is also possible to encounter intentional releases of anthrax spores, as was the case in October 2001. Consequently, it is important to be able to rapidly establish the provenance of infectious strains of B. anthracis. Here, we compare protein expression in seven low-passage wild isolates and four laboratory strains of B. anthracis grown under identical conditions using LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis. Of the 1,023 total identified proteins, 96 had significant abundance differences between wild and laboratory strains. Of those, 28 proteins directly related to sporulation were upregulated in wild isolates, with expression driven by Spo0A, CodY, and AbrB/ScoC. In addition, we observed evidence of changes in cell division and fatty acid biosynthesis between the two classes of strains, despite being grown under identical experimental conditions. These results suggest wild B. anthracis cells are more highly tuned to sporulate than their laboratory cousins, and this difference should be exploited as a method to differentiate between laboratory and low passage wild strains isolated during an anthrax outbreak. This knowledge should distinguish between intentional releases and exposure to strains in nature, providing a basis for the type of response by public health officials and investigators."
https://openalex.org/W2904532259,"Acting prosocially can be quite challenging in one of the most salient intergroup contexts in contemporary society: Soccer. When winning is the ultimate goal, balancing self-interest with helping a fellow player in distress can be a tough decision; yet it happens. To date, we know little about what motivates soccer players to offer such help in the heat of the game. We propose that sex and what is at stake will matter in such prosocial dilemma situations. A pilot study (N = 107) indicated that female players may be more likely to help than male players, but this difference was only observed when the players are close to scoring position rather than far away from the goal (midfield). The main study (N = 366) finds that young soccer players show elevated inclinations to help in low-stakes situations, for example when their team is winning or when the outcome of the game seems pretty much decided. Contrariwise, helping intentions decline in high-stakes situations, for example when one's own team is losing, when one is close to a scoring position in the offense (rather than at the midfield), or when the outcome of the game is still uncertain. Furthermore, female players show somewhat greater inclinations to help than their male counterparts. The current data point at some differences for male and female soccer players, albeit small in effect size. In contrast, we conclude that especially quick cost-benefit judgments regarding the stakes can play a major role in decisions to help or not to help another player on the soccer field."
https://openalex.org/W2904700241,"Patients with end-stage liver disease frequently experience acute kidney injury (AKI) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) have increasingly been accepted as a predictor of AKI in clinical settings. This study investigated the predictive role of intraoperative BNP levels in the early development of AKI after LDLT.Adult patients (≥19 years old) who had undergone elective LDLT from January 2011 to December 2017 were classified into the non-AKI and AKI groups according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Serum levels of BNP were measured three times in the preanhepatic, anhepatic, and neohepatic phases. Perioperative data in recipients and donors were analyzed retrospectively.Sixty-one patients (22.4%) suffered from AKI immediately after LDLT. Severity according to AKI stage was as follows: 28 patients in stage 1 (10.3%), 18 patients in stage 2 (6.6%), and 15 patients in stage 3 (5.5%). In the neohepatic phase, both BNP levels and proportions of patients with high BNP levels (≥100 pg/mL) were higher in the AKI group than in the non-AKI group. Only BNP levels in the non-AKI and AKI stage 1 groups significantly decreased from the preanhepatic phase to the neohepatic phase; those in AKI stages 2 and 3 groups did not. In particular, BNP levels of all AKI stage 3 patients increased to more than 100 pg/mL, and the proportion of patients with high levels also increased significantly through the surgical phases in the AKI stage 3 group. In multivariate analyses, BNP levels in the neohepatic phase were significantly associated with early development of AKI after LDLT, as well as the total amount of packed red blood cells in transfusions and total duration of graft ischemia.Monitoring serum levels of BNP is useful for predicting the early development of AKI after LDLT."
https://openalex.org/W2952043765,"Japan is one of the few rabies-free countries/territories which implement the policy of mandatory vaccination of domestic dogs. In order to assess the economic efficiency of such policy in reducing the economic burden of a future canine rabies outbreak in Japan, a benefit-cost analysis (BCA) was performed using probabilistic decision tree modelling. Input data derived from simulation results of published mathematical model, field investigation conducted by the authors at prefectural governments, literature review, international or Japanese database and empirical data of rabies outbreaks in other countries/territories. The current study revealed that the annual costs of implementing the current vaccination policy would be US$160,472,075 (90% prediction interval [PI]: $149,268,935-171,669,974). The economic burden of a potential single canine rabies outbreak in Japan were estimated to be US$1,682,707 (90% PI: $1,180,289-2,249,283) under the current vaccination policy, while it would be US$5,019,093 (90% PI: $3,986,882-6,133,687) under hypothetical abolition of vaccination policy, which is 3-fold higher. Under a damage-avoided approach, the annual benefits of implementing the current vaccination policy in expected value were estimated to be US$85.75 (90% PI: $55.73-116.89). The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) was estimated to be 5.35 X 10(-7) (90% PI: 3.46 X 10(-7)-7.37 X 10(-7)), indicating that the implementation of the current policy is very economically inefficient for the purpose of reducing the economic burden of a potential canine rabies outbreak. In worse-case scenario analysis, the BCR would become above 1 (indicating economic efficiency) if the risk of rabies introduction increased to 0.04 corresponding to a level of risk where rabies would enter Japan in 26 years while the economic burden of a rabies outbreak under the abolition of vaccination policy increased to $7.53 billion. Best-case analysis further revealed that under relatively extreme circumstances the economic efficiency of the current policy could be improved by decreasing the vaccination price charged to dog owners, relaxing the frequency of vaccination to every two to three years and implementing the policy on a smaller scale, e.g. only in targeted prefectures instead of the whole Japan."

It remains impossible to predict the occurrence of severe skin toxicity due to the lack of predictive markers. Here, we present the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with EGFR inhibitor-induced skin toxicity using data of the multicentre randomized phase III CAIRO2 trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00208546). In this study, advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer patients were treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab with or without cetuximab. Germline DNA was available in 282 of the 368 patients in the cetuximab arm. Mild skin toxicity occurred in 195 patients (i.e. CTC grade 1 or 2, respectively 91 and 104 patients) and severe skin toxicity (i.e. grade 3) in 36 patients. Grade 4 skin toxicity did not occur. None of the SNPs reached the formal genome wide threshold for significance of 5x10(-8), though SNPs of at least 8 loci did show moderate association (p-value between 5x10(-7) and 5x10(-5)) with the occurrence of grade 3 (severe) skin toxicity. These SNPs did not overlap with SNPs associated with cetuximab efficacy as found in a previous GWAS in the same CAIRO2 cohort. If formally proven by replication, the SNPs associated with severe EGFR induced skin toxicity may be helpful to predict the occurrence and severity of skin toxicity in patients that will receive cetuximab and allow for adequate information on the risk of skin toxicity and prophylactic measurements."

We have used the degree distribution, the clustering coefficient, and the interaction strength distribution as main measures. We also analyze the network properties for scenarios compared against randomly generated scenarios. We found that the stable situations show different characteristics from the unstable transitions present in the model. We also found that the complex emergent feature of sustainability shown in the model is an attribute of the scenarios, however, the randomly generated scenarios do not present the same network properties."
https://openalex.org/W2904497938,"This paper develops an empirical agent-based model to assess the impacts of Brexit on Scottish cattle farms. We first identify several trends and processes among Scottish cattle farms that were ongoing before Brexit: the lack of succession, the rise of leisure farming, the trend to diversify and industrialise, and, finally, the phenomenon of the ""disappearing middle"", characterised by the decline of medium-sized farms and the polarization of farm sizes. We then study the potential impact of Brexit amid the local context and those ongoing social processes. We find that the impact of Brexit is indeed subject to pre-Brexit conditions. For example, whether industrialization is present locally can significantly alter the impact of Brexit. The impact of Brexit also varies by location: we find a clear divide between constituencies in the north (highland and islands), the middle (the central belt) and the south. Finally, we argue that policy analysis of Brexit should consider the heterogeneous social context and the complex social processes under which Brexit occurs. Rather than fitting the world into simple system models and ignoring the evidence when it does not fit, we need to develop policy analysis frameworks that can incorporate real world complexities, so that we can assess the impacts of major events and policy changes in a more meaningful way."

We sought to investigate gastrointestinal diagnoses and CDI during hospitalizations in the 24 to 36 months after an initial episode of CDI in nonelderly patients in a cohort with an overall low prevalence of comorbid conditions. We performed a retrospective analysis of hospital admissions from 2010-2013 using the Truven MarketScan database of employment-based private insurance claims. Subjects <65 years of age and their adult dependents (> = 18 years old); a CDI diagnosis in 2011 (index date); at least 12 months of pre-index continuous enrollment; and 24-36 months of continuous post-index enrollment were included. The 12 months of each subject's enrollment prior to the index date for a CDI served as the reference period for the analyses of that subject's post-CDI time periods. Hospital claims during the follow-up period were evaluated for gastrointestinal diagnoses and/or CDI ICD-9 codes. The risk of gastrointestinal diagnoses was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for a pre-specified set of baseline demographic and clinical factors. During 2011, 5,632 subjects with CDI met the inclusion criteria for our study. The risk of gastrointestinal diagnoses in patients with a CDI diagnostic code for the same admission was almost 8-fold higher 3 months post-CDI (hazard ratio (HR) = 7.56; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.97-19.19) than for subjects without CDI and remained statistically significant until month 24 (HR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.04-2.08). After CDI, patients remained at risk for gastrointestinal symptoms with CDI for up to two years. There is an important, long-term healthcare burden after CDI in this population."

Our software allows to independently measure the current-voltage characteristics of each subsection by means of a set of arbitrary waveform generators and a nanovoltmeter that measures the voltage across the whole array with high sensitivity. A quantization test tool is also provided to check with sub-microvolt resolution whether the array is operating on its quantum margins. The code is modular and easily expandable with the support of many libraries, allowing prompt reconfiguration for different calibration and testing purposes. It is aimed at being a starting point for cooperation between National Metrology Institutes towards the realization of a shared quantum voltage calibration infrastructure."
https://openalex.org/W2903799364,"Although the visual cortex receives information at multiple temporal patterns, much of the research in the field has focused only on intervals shorter than 1 second. Consequently, there is almost no information on what happens at longer temporal intervals. We have tried to address this question recording neuronal populations of the primary visual cortex during visual stimulation with repetitive grating stimuli and intervals ranging from 1 to 7 seconds. Our results showed that firing rate and response stability were dependent of interval duration. In addition, there were collective oscillations with different properties in response to changes in intervals duration. These results suggest that visual cortex could encode visual information at several time scales using oscillations at multiple frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2905112249,"Increasing development such as roads and houses will alter future landscapes and result in biological, social, and economic trade-offs. Managing development requires information on the public’s acceptability of development and understanding which factors shape acceptability. In this study, we examined three questions: 1) What is the public’s acceptability of development? 2) Is acceptability of development influenced by wildlife information? and 3) Is the maximum amount of acceptable development influenced by views about wildlife, involvement in outdoor recreation, and demographic factors? We conducted a visual-preference survey of 9,000 households in Vermont, USA that asked about acceptable levels of development, acceptability of wildlife, involvement in recreation, and individual and town demographics. The survey response rate was 44%. Maximum acceptable condition (MAC) for development was 41 houses/km2 and not meaningfully influenced by broader consequences of development on seven common wildlife species. MAC was influenced by views on individual species, including bear and coyote, but not by other species such as deer, fox, and bobcat. Respondents with a positive attitude toward bear favored less development, whereas the opposite relationship existed for coyote. Similarly, MAC was negatively influenced by involvement in birding and hunting, but not by other common recreational activities. Among demographic factors, respondents that were younger and not born in Vermont were more accepting of development. Population density also positively influenced development acceptability. Results provide measures of the public’s acceptability of development that can help guide decision-making about development, wildlife, and recreation management."
