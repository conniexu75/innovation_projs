https://openalex.org/W2002873588,"Interaction between percolating groludwaters and aragonitic carbonate sediments within the vadose zone of the coral cap of Barbados, West Indies, results in dissolution of aragonite and concurrent reprecipitation as low-magnesium calcite. Comparison of the ratios of strontium to calcium in groundwater, aragonitic carbonate, and recrystallized calcite indicates that locally the solution-reprecipitation process is operating at an efficiency greater than 90 percent."
https://openalex.org/W2064835968,"Garnet has been identified for the first time as a meteorite mineral in the Coorara chondrite from Western Australia. It replaces olivine grains in a 1-millimeter veinlet traversing the body of the meteorite. The associated olivine has abnormally low birefringence, which suggests a highly shocked condition. Microprobe analyses do not distinguish the garnet from the associated olivine, which has the composition (Mg(.75)Fe(.25))(2) SiO(4); the garnet may have the composition Mg(3)Fe(2)Si(3)O(12) but be unresolvable from the accompanying olivine, or alternatively is nonstoichiometric. Transformation of olivine to garnet under high pressure could have significant implications for the phase composition of the Earth's mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2010256193,"Schiff '8 reagent prepared with thionyl chloride is 1.24; that of Schiff 's reagent prepared in the usual manner is 1.38. This slight difference in acidity does not appear to be significant. Schiff 's reagent prepared with thionyl chloride has been successfully used as a nuclear stain on tissue sections of human thymus gland, kidney, liver, and spleen, as well as on the fungi, Blastomyces dermatitidis and Sacoharomyces cervisiae."
