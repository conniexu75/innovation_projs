A major obstacle to understanding disease pathogenesis and to the development of effective therapies has been the lack of a small-animal model for rhinovirus infection. Of the 100 known rhinovirus serotypes, 90% (the major group) use human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as their cellular receptor and do not bind mouse ICAM-1; the remaining 10% (the minor group) use a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family and can bind the mouse counterpart. Here we describe three novel mouse models of rhinovirus infection: minor-group rhinovirus infection of BALB/c mice, major-group rhinovirus infection of transgenic BALB/c mice expressing a mouse-human ICAM-1 chimera and rhinovirus-induced exacerbation of allergic airway inflammation. These models have features similar to those observed in rhinovirus infection in humans, including augmentation of allergic airway inflammation, and will be useful in the development of future therapies for colds and asthma exacerbations."
https://openalex.org/W2038444711,"To define novel pathways that regulate susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we have performed genome-wide expression profiling of microRNAs (miRs). We show that in TRAIL-resistant NSCLC cells, levels of different miRs are increased, and in particular, miR-221 and -222. We demonstrate that these miRs impair TRAIL-dependent apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of key functional proteins. Indeed, transfection with anti-miR-221 and -222 rendered CALU-1-resistant cells sensitive to TRAIL. Conversely, H460-sensitive cells treated with -221 and -222 pre-miRs become resistant to TRAIL. miR-221 and -222 target the 3′-UTR of Kit and p27kip1 mRNAs, but interfere with TRAIL signaling mainly through p27kip1. In conclusion, we show that high expression levels of miR-221 and -222 are needed to maintain the TRAIL-resistant phenotype, thus making these miRs as promising therapeutic targets or diagnostic tool for TRAIL resistance in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2009102003,"Wingless (Wnt) signaling regulates many aspects of development and tissue homeostasis, and aberrant Wnt signaling can lead to cancer. Upon a Wnt signal β-catenin degradation is halted and consequently the level of β-catenin in the cytoplasm increases. This allows entry of β-catenin into the nucleus where it can regulate gene transcription by direct binding to members of the lymphoid enhancer factor/T cell factor (TCF) family of transcription factors. Recently, we identified Forkhead box-O (FOXO) transcription factors as novel interaction partners of β-catenin (Essers, M. A., de Vries-Smits, L. M., Barker, N., Polderman, P. E., Burgering, B. M., and Korswagen, H. C. (2005) Science 308, 1181-1184). Here we show that the β-catenin binding to FOXO serves a dual effect. β-catenin, through binding, enhances FOXO transcriptional activity. In addition, FOXO competes with TCF for interaction with β-catenin, thereby inhibiting TCF transcriptional activity. Reduced binding between TCF and β-catenin is observed after FOXO overexpression and cellular oxidative stress, which simultaneously increases binding between β-catenin and FOXO. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-mediated knock down of FOXO reverts loss of β-catenin binding to TCF after cellular oxidative stress. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a cross-talk mechanism between FOXO and TCF signaling in which β-catenin plays a central regulatory role.

Wnt proteins are closely related secreted glycoproteins that act as growth factors on cells and play critical roles in cell proliferation and cell fate determination at many stages of development (2Cadigan K.M.

Genetic and biochemical experiments in Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis, and mammalian cells have established a framework for the Wnt signaling pathway. In the absence of a Wnt signal, cytoplasmic β-catenin is bound to a multi-protein β-catenin destruction complex that contains several proteins, including Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), 3The abbreviations used are: APCadenomatous polyposis coliGSKglycogen synthase kinase 3HAhemagglutininTCFT cell factorFOXOForkhead box-OJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinase4OHT4-hydroxy-tamoxifenHIFhypoxia-inducible factorTOPTCF Optimal PromoterFOPFake Optimal Promoter. 3The abbreviations used are: APCadenomatous polyposis coliGSKglycogen synthase kinase 3HAhemagglutininTCFT cell factorFOXOForkhead box-OJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinase4OHT4-hydroxy-tamoxifenHIFhypoxia-inducible factorTOPTCF Optimal PromoterFOPFake Optimal Promoter. casein kinase Iα (CKIα) and ϵ (CKIϵ) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3).

Deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, for example due to loss of APC, results in stabilization and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and results in tumor formation (16Polakis P.

The FOXO subfamily of transcription factors is critically involved in the regulation of apoptosis, proliferation, and the control of oxidative stress (reviewed in Ref. 17Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). FOXOs are negatively regulated by the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase B pathway. Activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase B will induce phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of FOXO, thereby inhibiting FOXO transcriptional activity. Recently, we and others have obtained evidence that FOXOs are also controlled by oxidative stress. In contrast to insulin signaling, increased cellular oxidative stress relocalizes FOXO to the nucleus and results in FOXO activation (18Essers M.A. Weijzen S. de Vries-Smits A.M. Saarloos I. de Ruiter N.D. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4802-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Activation by increased cellular oxidative stress requires phosphorylation by JNK and this is evolutionary conserved. In D. melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans dFOXO and DAF-16 are also phosphorylated by JNK, and JNK activity increases lifespan in D. melanogaster and C. elegans in a dFOXO/DAF1-16 dependent manner (19Wang M.C. Bohmann D. Jasper H. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 811-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 20Oh S.W. Mukhopadhyay A. Svrzikapa N. Jiang F. Davis R.J. Tissenbaum H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4494-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that β-catenin directly binds to FOXO and that this binding leads to enhanced FOXO transcriptional activity (1Essers M.A. de Vries-Smits L.M. Barker N. Polderman P.E. Burgering B.M. Korswagen H.C. Science. 2005; 308: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The binding of β-catenin to FOXO is increased under conditions of oxidative stress, and genetic analysis in C. elegans demonstrated that the interaction between FOXO and β-catenin is conserved and thus reveals an evolutionary conserved function for β-catenin, independent of TCF. Consistent with regulation of FOXO by phosphoinositide-3 kinase and Ras signaling, ligand-independent activation of FOXO causes a cell cycle arrest in G1, both in cells transformed with oncogenic Ras and cells with a deletion of, or a mutation in, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) (21Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Interestingly, colon carcinoma cells transformed by activated β-catenin/TCF signaling due to an APC truncation are also arrested in G1 by activation of FOXO (22Kops G.J. Medema R.H. Glassford J. Essers M.A. Dijkers P.F. Coffer P.J. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2025-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), suggesting that FOXO expression can suppress β-catenin/TCF signaling toward proliferation. Therefore, we here investigated the consequences of the binding between β-catenin and FOXO for signaling through the β-catenin-TCF complex. We show that activation of FOXO leads to inhibition of TCF transcriptional activity. This suggested that interaction of FOXO and β-catenin competes with the binding of β-catenin with TCF. Consistent with this, increased cellular oxidative stress resulting from H2O2 treatment reduced the TCF/β-catenin interaction and this is likely mediated via FOXO as siRNA-mediated knockdown of FOXO expression alleviated H2O2-induced reduction in β-catenin-TCF complex formation. Taken together, these data provide evidence for a novel mechanism of cross-talk between Wnt and phosphoinositide-3 kinase signaling whereby β-catenin acts as a pivot between essential downstream elements of these signaling pathways, TCF and FOXO, respectively. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Infection—DL23 cells, DLD1 cells expressing a conditionally active FOXO3a.A3-ER fusion, were created as described (22Kops G.J. Medema R.H. Glassford J. Essers M.A. Dijkers P.F. Coffer P.J. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2025-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). DLD1 human colon carcinoma cells, DL23 cells, and LS174T human colon carcinoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. DL23 cells were treated with 500 nm 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT) for 8, 16, or 24 h to activate the fusion protein. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and Phoenix cells expressing the amphotrophe receptor were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Human embryonic kidney 293T, DLD1, and DL23 cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent according to the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Total amounts of transfected DNA were equalized using pBluescript KSII+. LS174T cells were infected with pBabe-puro or pBabe-FOXO3a.A3 virus. For virus production Phoenix cells were transfected using SuperFect transfection reagent (3 mg/ml) with pBabe-puro or pBabe-FOXO3a.A3. Two days after transfection medium of the transfected Phoenix cells was harvested. LS174T cells were infected by adding the medium of the Phoenix cells together with 6 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide. Infection was repeated 6 h after the first round. The day after infection, cells were seeded in selection medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Plasmids—The following constructs have been described before: pMT2-HA-FOXO4 (23Kops G.J. de Ruiter N.D. De Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M.

Pract. 1996; 192: 694-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); pRL-Tk (Tk Renilla luciferase) was purchased from Promega. FLAG-β-catenin was a gift from M. van de Wetering (Hubrecht Laboratory, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Short hairpin RNA were designed and cloned into pSuperior vector of OligoEngine. Short hairpin RNA is directed against the following targets: FOXO4 Human/Mouse1, GGAAATCAGTCATATGCAGAA; FOXO4 Human/Mouse2, AAGTTCATCAAGGTTCACAAC; nontargeting oligo, TTGATGTGTTTAGTCGCTA. Antibodies—Monoclonal 12CA5 and 9E10 antibodies were produced using hybridoma cell lines. Monoclonal antibody β-catenin was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal HA antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The ABC antibody recognizing dephosphorylated β-catenin was generously provided by Mascha van Noort and Hans Clevers (Hubrecht Laboratory, The Netherlands). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—Non-confluent cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin), and lysates were cleared for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with either 1 μl of 12CA5 or 9E10 antibody or 7.5 μl of β-catenin antibody and 50 μl of pre-washed protein-A beads. The immunoprecipitations were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and cleared for all liquid, and 25 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer was added. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer). Western blot analysis was performed under standard conditions and using the indicated antibodies. Luciferase Reporter Assays—DLD1 and DL23 cells were transiently transfected with either a reporter construct bearing multiple copies of an optimal TCF-binding site (pTOPglow) or a reporter construct bearing multiple copies of a mutant form of the optimal TCF-binding site (pFOPglow) (25Vermeulen S. Van Marck V. Van Hoorde L. Van Roy F. Bracke M. Mareel M. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1996; 192: 694-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DLD1 cells were cotransfected with HA-FOXO4, HA-FOXO4ΔDB, HA-HOXO3a, or a control plasmid. DL23 and DLD1 cells were treated with 500 nm 4OHT for the indicated times. Luciferase counts were normalized using Tk-Renilla-luciferase. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in passive lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was analyzed using a luminometer and a dual-luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer (Promega). The -fold induction of luciferase activity on the TOPglow construct was divided by the -fold induction on the Fopglow construct, and this TCF Optimal Promoter (TOP)/Fake Optimal Promoter (FOP) ratio was plotted. Real-time PCR Analysis—The expression of endogenous TCF target genes in DLD1, DL23, and LS174T cells was determined by reverse transcription of total RNA followed by real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from DLD1, DL23, and LS174T cells using the RNAZol procedure (TELTEST, Inc.). Using the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA. Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI cycler using Sybr Green (ABI) with the following primer sets: Pitx2 forward, ACGCGAAGAAATCGCTGTG, reverse, CGACGATTCTTGAACCAAACC; Ephrin B2 forward, TGTCCAGACAAGAGCCATG, reverse, TTTATTCCTGGTTGATCCAGCAG; Cyclin D1 forward, GCCGAGAAGCTGTGCATCTAC, reverse, TCCACTTGAGCTTGTTCACCAG; p130 forward, CTCAGGAATGCACCAAGTGAG, reverse, GCAATAGCCTGGGTTGGATC. Primers for Tspan5 were a gift from N. Barker (Hubrecht Laboratory, Utrecht, The Netherlands). FOXO Inhibits β-Catenin/TCF-dependent Transcription— To investigate whether the interaction between β-catenin and FOXO would affect the function of β-catenin as a co-activator of TCF transcriptional activity, we first analyzed the effect of FOXO activation on β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription. To this end we used DL23 cells, which are DLD1 colon carcinoma cells expressing a conditionally active HA-FOXO3a. A3-ER fusion protein (26Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). FOXO3a activity can be switched on in these cells by treating cells with the estrogen analog 4OHT (26Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Because of a mutation in the APC gene, these cells contain high levels of stabilized β-catenin and thus display high β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity. Activation of FOXO3a in these cells, induced by 4OHT treatment, resulted in inhibition of TCF-dependent transcription as measured by the TOP/FOP reporter assay (25Vermeulen S. Van Marck V. Van Hoorde L. Van Roy F. Bracke M. Mareel M. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1996; 192: 694-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Activation of the TOPglow reporter, which contains multiple copies of an optimal TCF-binding site, was greatly reduced by activated FOXO, whereas FOXO had no effect on the FOPglow reporter, which contains multiple copies of a mutant form of the TCF-binding site (25Vermeulen S. Van Marck V. Van Hoorde L. Van Roy F. Bracke M. Mareel M. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1996; 192: 694-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Also, transient expression of FOXO3a and FOXO4 in DLD1 cells strongly inhibited TCF transcriptional activity, suggesting this effect not to be specific to FOXO3a or the inducible FOXO3a-A3-ER fusion protein (Fig. 1B). Thus, activation of FOXOs inhibits the activity of the TCF transcription factor. Inhibition of TCF transcriptional activity following FOXO activation may occur through various mechanisms. FOXO activation may result in β-catenin degradation. However, total β-catenin levels were not affected by 4OHT treatment (Fig. 1A). In addition, we also analyzed whether the observed inhibition of TOP/FOP reporter activity was due to reduced levels of β-catenin not phosphorylated on its GSK-3 sites (“active” β-catenin). To determine this pool of β-catenin not phosphorylated at its GSK-3 sites, we performed immunoblotting using the ABC antibody (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Again, similar to total β-catenin, we did not observe a major change in dephosphorylated β-catenin. Recently, the use of antibodies detecting unphosphorylated β-catenin levels has become a subject of discussion (27van Noort M. Meeldijk J. van der Zee R. Destree O. Clevers H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17901-17905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), and it may be argued that the specificity of this type of antibodies is not sufficient. Irrespective of this discussion, it can be concluded that the observed inhibition of TOP/FOP reporter activity is not likely the result of increased GSK-3-mediated β-catenin phosphorylation. The observed inhibition of TOP/FOP reporter activity following FOXO activation could also result from FOXO competing with TCF for binding to the TCF DNA-binding sites present in the TOPglow reporter. We analyzed in vitro binding of FOXO to known TCF DNA binding elements. Whereas in vitro the DNA binding domain of FOXO4 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-FOXO4-DB) did bind to the IRE (T(G/A)TTT motif-containing insulin-response element) present within the IGFBP-1 promoter, it failed to interact with the TCF-binding sites present within the Ultrabithorax homeotic gene promoter (14Riese J. Yu X. Munnerlyn A. Eresh S. Hsu S.C. Grosschedl R. Bienz M. Cell. 1997; 88: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This indicates that competition for DNA binding is unlikely. Furthermore, in vivo a FOXO4 mutant lacking the DNA binding domain (FOXO4ΔDB) was still able to inhibit β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity (Fig. 1B). Thus, inhibition of TCF signaling by FOXOs is independent of FOXO DNA binding activity and therefore not due to direct competition between FOXO and TCF for binding to the TCF consensus DNA sequence. Activation of FOXOs in DLD1 cells causes a cell cycle arrest in G1 (26Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). To exclude that the inhibition of TCF signaling by FOXOs was not secondary to the ability of FOXOs to induce a cell cycle arrest, we performed the TOP/FOP reporter assay in the presence of the cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4 or p21WAF1. Expression of these cell cycle inhibitors in DL23 and DLD1 cells induced a G1 arrest (data not shown), and this did result in a partial reduction of TCF-dependent transcription (Fig. 1C), suggesting that indeed a cell cycle arrest in G1 in these cells may contribute to the reduced β-catenin/TCF activity. More importantly, TCF activity was still further reduced upon activation of FOXO3a in the DL23 cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that although a cell cycle arrest may contribute to the inhibition of TCF signaling by FOXO this inhibition cannot account fully for the effect of FOXO. Thus, FOXO-mediated inhibition is not just secondary to the ability of FOXOs to induce a cell cycle arrest in these cells. Previously, we showed that β-catenin could bind both FOXO3a and FOXO4 (1Essers M.A. de Vries-Smits L.M. Barker N. Polderman P.E. Burgering B.M. Korswagen H.C. Science. 2005; 308: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Similar to FOXO3a, overexpression of FOXO4 inhibited TCF transcriptional activity, indicating that the ability of FOXOs to inhibit TCF signaling correlates with their ability to bind β-catenin. Thus, from these experiments we conclude that the observed inhibition of TOP/FOP reporter activity following FOXO activation most likely results from β-catenin binding to FOXO and consequently sequestration of β-catenin away from TCF. FOXO Reduces Binding of β-Catenin to TCF—Previously, we have shown that FOXO binds to armadillo repeat 1-7 of β-catenin, the same region to which TCF binds (1Essers M.A. de Vries-Smits L.M. Barker N. Polderman P.E. Burgering B.M. Korswagen H.C. Science. 2005; 308: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 11Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2560) Google Scholar), suggesting that competition between FOXO and TCF for β-catenin indeed may occur. To establish more directly whether interaction between FOXO and β-catenin could compete with the interaction between TCF and β-catenin, we next analyzed binding between TCF and β-catenin in DL23 cells. Activation of FOXO3a in DL23 cells by adding 4OHT reduced the interaction between β-catenin and TCF4 (Fig. 2A). 4OHT treatment of the control DLD1 cells did not affect this interaction. Furthermore, time course analysis showed that decreased β-catenin/TCF interaction could already be observed after 8 h of 4OHT treatment (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the time course of inhibition of TOP/FOP reporter activity as shown in Fig. 1A. Next we analyzed interaction of HA-TCF4 and β-catenin in 293T cells. Following stabilization of β-catenin through LiCl-mediated GSK-3 inhibition, substantial binding of HA-TCF4 and β-catenin is observed. Co-expression of FOXO4 resulted in reduced HA-TCF4/β-catenin interaction (Fig. 2C). Taken together these data suggest that FOXO and TCF-4 compete for interaction with β-catenin and that the inhibition of TCF signaling by FOXO reflects the ability of FOXO to compete with TCF for the interaction with β-catenin. Although the above provided evidence that FOXO can compete with TCF for β-catenin binding, the reverse may also occur. To test whether TCF can reduce the association between FOXO and β-catenin we analyzed oxidative stress-induced binding between FOXO4 and β-catenin in the absence or presence of increasing levels of exogenously expressed TCF (Fig. 2D). Increasing levels of TCF resulted in loss of stress-induced binding between FOXO4 and β-catenin, indicating competition occurs in a reciprocal manner. Peroxide Stress-induced TCF/β-Catenin Inhibition Is Mediated via FOXO—In DL23 cells FOXO activation occurs after 4OHT treatment. Treatment of cells with oxidative stress also results in activation of FOXO (18Essers M.A. Weijzen S. de Vries-Smits A.M. Saarloos I. de Ruiter N.D. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4802-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Furthermore, following treatment of cells with increasing amounts of oxidative stress the interaction between FOXO and β-catenin is induced and transcriptional activity of FOXO is enhanced (1Essers M.A. de Vries-Smits L.M. Barker N. Polderman P.E. Burgering B.M. Korswagen H.C. Science. 2005; 308: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Thus it is predicted that cellular oxidative stress will impact on TCF transcriptional activity. Indeed, increasing concentrations of H2O2 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in TCF transcriptional activity (Fig. 3A) and a dose-dependent decrease in HA-TCF4 interaction with β-catenin (Fig. 3B). To establish whether the observed decrease in HA-TCF4 binding to β-catenin after H2O2 treatment of cells is due to increased interaction of β-catenin with FOXO following H2O2 treatment of cells, we made use of small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of FOXO4 in 293T cells. H2O2-induced reduction of HA-TCF4-β-catenin complex formation was largely rescued by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of FOXO4 (Fig. 3C). As 293T cells express both FOXO3a and FOXO4 (28Bois P.R. Grosveld G.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) this seems to suggest that FOXO4 is the main FOXO interacting with β-catenin. These results are consistent with a model that FOXO and TCF compete for β-catenin interaction and that cellular oxidative stress regulates this by diverting β-catenin from TCF to FOXO. Inhibition of Endogenous β-Catenin/TCF Target Genes by Activation of FOXO—Finally, we tested whether expression of endogenous β-catenin/TCF target genes can be inhibited by activation of FOXOs. To this end we compared DL23 and DLD1 cells induced with 4OHT (Fig. 4A) or LS174T colon carcinoma cells infected with either a control virus or a constitutively active FOXO construct, FOXO3a.A3 (Fig. 4B). Quantitative PCRs for several target genes were performed on the isolated RNA from these cells. As described, FOXO3a activation in DL23 cells induced the expression of the known FOXO target gene p130 (Fig. 4A) (26Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). On the other hand, expression of cyclin D1 was inhibited (Fig. 4A). Cyclin D1 has been described as a target gene for the β-catenin-TCF complex (29Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar), and inhibition of cyclin D1 expression by FOXO has been described previously (30Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sansal I. Bergeron L. Sellers W.R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 31Schmidt M. Fernandez de Mattos S. van der Horst A. Klompmaker R. Kops G.J. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7842-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Importantly, inhibition of cyclin D1 expression by FOXO occurs at the transcriptional level (30Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sansal I. Bergeron L. Sellers W.R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 31Schmidt M. Fernandez de Mattos S. van der Horst A. Klompmaker R. Kops G.J. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7842-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), although the cyclin D1 promoter does not contain a bona fide FOXO DNA binding element (31Schmidt M. Fernandez de Mattos S. van der Horst A. Klompmaker R. Kops G.J. Lam E.W. Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7842-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and inhibition was shown to be independent of binding of FOXO to the cyclin D1 promoter region (30Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sansal I. Bergeron L. Sellers W.R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The cyclin D1 inhibition can be explained by the competition of FOXO and TCF to interact with β-catenin. However, gene expression regulation often summarizes the action of multiple signaling pathways, and thus cyclin D1 regulation does not necessarily reflect the status of only TCF and FOXO signaling or the interaction between TCF and FOXO. Therefore, to exclude as much as possible interference of other signaling pathways we also analyzed other TCF target genes. Activation of FOXO3a by 4OHT treatment in DL23 cells also repressed the mRNA expression of the TCF target genes Pitx2 (32Kioussi C. Briata P. Baek S.H. Rose D.W. Hamblet N.S. Herman T. Ohgi K.A. Lin C. Gleiberman A. Wang J. Brault V. Ruiz-Lozano P. Nguyen H.D. Kemler R. Glass C.K. Wynshaw-Boris A. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 111: 673-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and Ephrin B2 (6Batlle E. Henderson J.T. Beghtel H. van den Born M.M. Sancho E. Huls G. Meeldijk J. Robertson J. van de Wetering M. Pawson T. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). This result demonstrated that activation of FOXO3a inhibits the expression of multiple TCF target genes. To exclude that the repression of TCF target genes is specific to the DL23 cells and/or the 4OHT induction system, we also analyzed the effect of expression of active FOXO3a in LS174T colon carcinoma cells. Both DLD1 and LS174T cells are colon carcinoma cells with elevated levels of β-catenin, although the differentiation status of both cell lines is different. LS174T cells harbor mutated β-catenin with wild type APC and p53, whereas DLD1 cells have wild type β-catenin but mutant APC and p53. Again, we observed repression of Ephrin B2 mRNA levels by FOXO3a (Fig. 4B). Also, the mRNA expression level of tetraspanin-5, a β-catenin/TCF-dependent target gene specific to LS174T as compared with DLD-1 cells, 4N. Barker, personal communication. was repressed by FOXO3a (Fig. 4B). Thus, FOXO3a can repress the transcriptional activation of multiple β-catenin/TCF-dependent target genes in cell types that differ with respect to the mechanism by which β-catenin is stabilized, and therefore the effect of FOXO3a on endogenous gene regulation is again likely to be at the level of β-catenin. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the interaction betweenβ-catenin and FOXO inhibits endogenous TCF-dependent gene transcription. The data presented here suggest a model in which β-catenin provides a link between the WNT signaling pathway and the oxidative stress/FOXO pathway. We show that FOXO inhibits TCF-dependent transcription by binding to β-catenin and therefore functionally competes with TCF. Peroxide stress can strengthen the interaction between FOXO and β-catenin and potently inhibit TCF-dependent transcription. Furthermore, we show that FOXO is important for the peroxide stress-induced inhibition of TCF/β-catenin interaction. Competition between FOXO and TCF is reciprocal as we also observed a dose-dependent decrease in stress-induced FOXO/β-catenin interaction following TCF overexpression. Furthermore, TCF and FOXO bind to the same part of β-catenin (1Essers M.A. de Vries-Smits L.M. Barker N. Polderman P.E. Burgering B.M. Korswagen H.C. Science. 2005; 308: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and we cannot detect the presence of FOXO in TCF immunoprecipitates. 5D. Hoogeboom, E. Voets, and B. Burgering, data not shown. Thus, we conclude that FOXO and TCF compete for the same pool of active β-catenin. Consequently, FOXO can inhibit TCF and vice versa TCF can inhibit FOXO signaling, and therefore they act through β-catenin as interdependent negative regulators. It is becoming apparent that the role of β-catenin in regulating gene transcription is not restricted to TCF. Besides binding and regulating FOXO, binding of β-catenin to HIF-1α and c-jun has been reported (33Kaidi A. Williams A.C. Paraskeva C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 34Nateri A.S. Spencer-Dene B. Behrens A. Nature. 2005; 437: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Kaidi et al. (33Kaidi A. Williams A.C. Paraskeva C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) show that β-catenin can interact with HIF1α in a way similar to FOXO. During hypoxia the β-catenin/TCF interaction is inhibited whereas the β-catenin/HIF1α interaction is enhanced. This leads to higher expression of HIF1α target genes whereby β-catenin promotes adaptation to hypoxia. Once hypoxia is being resolved β-catenin binds again to TCF and proliferation of the cells can be restored. β-Catenin and c-jun also interact, albeit indirectly via TCF. This creates in a β-catenin-mediated manner a positive feedback loop increasing the expression of c-jun. The interaction is phosphorylation (JNK)-dependent and thus integrates both the JNK and APC/β-catenin pathways (34Nateri A.S. Spencer-Dene B. Behrens A. Nature. 2005; 437: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In addition to regulation of β-catenin-mediated TCF transcriptional activity through the destruction complex, Wnt signaling also regulates so-called non-canonical Wnt signaling that involves stress-activated kinases like JNK and Nemo-like kinase. Interesting from the perspective of the negative regulation of TCF activity following oxidative stress as we observed here, non-canonical signaling also inhibits TCF activity. Thus, Wnt signaling harbors a built-in control of dampening TCF activity based upon stress signaling cascades. In contrast to TCF, JNK through direct phosphorylation of FOXO increases FOXO activity (18Essers M.A. Weijzen S. de Vries-Smits A.M. Saarloos I. de Ruiter N.D. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4802-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), suggesting JNK controls a switch from TCF inactivation to FOXO activation under conditions of oxidative stress. However, in JNK-/- cells FOXO expression still reduces TCF transcriptional activity, indicating that JNK is at least not essential. 5D. Hoogeboom, E. Voets, and B. Burgering, data not shown. A recent study by Funato et al. (35Funato Y. Michiue T. Asashima M. Miki H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) reported that oxidative stress results in activation rather than inhibition of TCF transcriptional activity. By interacting with Dishevelled, nucleoredoxin inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Peroxide stress decreases the interaction between nucleoredoxin and Dishevelled leading to the stabilization of β-catenin and subsequent activation of TCF. These results are in contrast to the observations reported here. A possible explanation for this difference could reside within the kinetics of the observed effect. Funato et al. observe a rapid but transient activation of TCF signaling by peroxide, peaking at 20 min, whereas we and others observe inhibition after prolonged periods of peroxide stress. However, a more intriguing possible explanation is suggested by the fact that Funato et al. employed NIH3T3 cells overexpressing Dishevelled. Shin et al. (36Shin S.Y. Chin B.R. Lee Y.H. Kim J.H. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that similar to our results β-catenin/TCF signaling is reduced after peroxide stress but that overexpression of Dishevelled could abrogate the effect of hydrogen peroxide. Thus, Dishevelled expression appears an important determinant in the sensitivity of TCF signaling toward oxidative stress. How this occurs precisely remains to be determined but could simply be a matter of signal strength. In that case, following Disheveled overexpression β-catenin levels would increase to such levels that binding of β-catenin to FOXO and TCF can be saturated simultaneously and thus competition cannot, or can no longer, occur. Irrespective, these results further corroborate the notion that β-catenin/TCF signaling is tightly controlled by cellular oxidative stress. Similar to FOXO, both c-jun and HIF-1α are regulated by oxidative stress pathways. It can be concluded that under oxidative stress conditions it is apparently important for cells to diverge from TCF to FOXO and probably other (c-jun, HIF-1α) stress-regulated transcriptional programs. Being the commonality, this suggests an important role for β-catenin in stress regulation; consistent with this idea, we observed previously in C. elegans that BAR-1, the C. elegans β-catenin homologue, regulates resistance against oxidative stress independent of its binding to POP-1, the TCF homologue in C. elegans (1Essers M.A. de Vries-Smits L.M. Barker N. Polderman P.E. Burgering B.M. Korswagen H.C. Science. 2005; 308: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Finally, our data establish a potential point of interaction between insulin/IGF1 signaling and Wnt signaling. In contrast to cellular oxidative stress, insulin does not substantially affect β-catenin FOXO interaction, at least as measured by co-immunoprecipitation. 6D. Hoogeboom, data not shown. Indeed, it has been shown that insulin/insulin-like growth factor can inhibit Wnt signaling at the level of β-catenin (37Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Cherqui G. Perret C. Capeau J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 38Playford M.P. Bicknell D. Bodmer W.F. Macaulay V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12103-12108Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Several other studies have explored the possibility that insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 would influence β-catenin by activation of protein kinase B/Akt and inhibition of GSK-3 (39Fukumoto S. Hsieh C.M. Maemura K. Layne M.D. Yet S.F. Lee K.H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Taylor W.G. Rubin J.S. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, although these studies did indicate that insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 to some extent may regulate TCF activity, the involvement of protein kinase B-regulated GSK-3 activity appeared unlikely. This has led to the suggestion that different pools of GSK-3 may exist and that these pools are restricted to either Wnt or insulin signaling (40Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 41Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To fully appreciate the interaction between insulin and Wnt signaling clearly requires further studies.

https://openalex.org/W2026388532,"In epithelial cells, the tight junction divides the plasma membrane into distinct apical and basolateral domains. Polarization is essential for epithelial cell function, and apico-basal cell polarity is lost during the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a program of events characterized not only by loss of cell polarity, but also by enhanced cell motility and increased cell invasion. Among several apically localized protein complexes, the Crumbs and Par protein complexes have pivotal roles in control of epithelial polarity and apical membrane formation. Here, we demonstrate that the Snail transcriptional repressor antagonizes expression of the Crumbs polarity complex. We show that Snail abolishes localization of the Crumbs and Par complexes to the tight junction, decreases Crumbs complex protein levels and suppresses Crumbs3 transcription. Evidence that Snail acts directly to antagonize Crumbs3 promoter activity is presented. Strikingly, we note that reexpression of exogenous Crumbs3 in Snail-expressing Madin–Darby Canine Kidney cells partially restores cell–cell junctions. Moreover, we find that the EMT inducer transforming growth factor-β elicits transcriptional repression of Crumbs3 and results in a measurable loss of Crumbs3 protein. Our findings provide new insights into the links between the transcriptional repression function of Snail and its role in antagonizing key apico-basal polarity factors during EMT."

These results demonstrate ameloblast-specific expression of enamelin and reveal that enamelin is essential for proper enamel matrix organization and mineralization. Enamel crystals have a unique shape and organization. They are many times longer than they are wide and are organized into rods (prisms), each comprising about 10,000 individual crystallites (1Daculsi G. Kerebel B. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1978; 65: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2Nanci, A. (ed) (2003) in Ten Cate's Oral Histology Development, Structure, and Function, 6th Ed., pp. 218-224, Mosby, St. Louis, MOGoogle Scholar). Each rod is the product of a single ameloblast in which crystals are formed under the control of specialized enamel proteins secreted by ameloblasts (3Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Simmer J.P. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 270-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These proteins assemble immediately subjacent to the secretory pole of the ameloblast cell membrane such that mineralization occurs immediately at this cell-matrix interface (4Ronnholm E. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1962; 6: 249-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because enamel crystals grow longer at this mineralization front, the ameloblasts are displaced away from the growing tooth as the enamel layer as a whole thickens. Once the enamel crystals are fully elongated and the enamel layer has reached its final thickness, the secretion of enamel proteins is terminated or greatly reduced, accumulated extracellular proteins are degraded and reabsorbed, and the crystals grow in width and thickness until adjacent crystals come into contact. Thus, the secretion of enamel proteins is associated with the early part of crystal formation, when the crystals are growing primarily in length and the growing crystal tips are in close proximity to the secretory surface of the ameloblast. There are three major secretory stage enamel proteins: amelogenin (5Snead M.L. Zeichner-David M. Chandra T. Robson K.J. Woo S.L. Slavkin H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting enamel phenotypes include a rough and pitted enamel surface in heterozygous mice and enamel agenesis in the null condition. In addition to the three secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins, two proteases are secreted into the developing enamel layer: matrix metalloproteinase 20 (MMP-20) 2The abbreviations used are: MMP-20, matrix metalloproteinase 20; β-gal, β-galactosidase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; KLK4, kallikrein 4; Neo, neomycin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PGK, phosphoglycerine kinase; DEJ, dentino-enamel junction; HA, hydroxyapatite; μCT, microcomputed tomography; SEM, scanning electron microscopy. and kallikrein 4 (KLK4) (26Bartlett J.D.

Simmer J.P. Margolis H.C. Connect. Tissue Res. 1998; 39: 405-413Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas KLK4 (19q13.4) is expressed in many tissues, but most notably it is expressed in developing teeth and in prostate gland (36Nelson P.S.

It is clear that amelogenin, ameloblastin, enamelin, MMP-20, and KLK4 are all necessary for proper dental enamel formation, but they are not sufficient. Defects in AMELX, ENAM, MMP20 (11q22.3), and KLK4 account for only about one-fourth of all cases of amelogenesis imperfecta (39Kim J.W. Simmer J.P. Lin B.P. Seymen F. Bartlett J.D. Hu J.C. Eur. J. Oral. Sci. 2006; 114: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Despite the large number of amelogenesis imperfecta cases of unknown etiology, the proteins resident in the enamel layer of developing teeth have been thoroughly analyzed, and it is likely that most, if not all, of the major extracellular components have been identified (40Yamakoshi, Y., Hu, J. C.-C., Ryu, O. H., Tanabe, T., Oida, S., Fukae, M., and Simmer, J. P.

The secretion of proteases along with the enamel proteins means that intact enamelin and ameloblastin cannot be isolated from developing teeth. These enamel proteins have multiple glycosylation sites and other post-translational modifications, even hydroxyproline (41Fukae M. Tanabe T. Murakami C. Dohi N. Uchida T. Shimizu M. Adv. Dent. Res. 1996; 10: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 42Hu C.-C. Fukae M. Uchida T. Qian Q. Zhang C.H. Ryu O.H. Tanabe T. Yamakoshi Y. Murakami C. Dohi N. Shimizu M. Simmer J.P. J. Dent.

Therefore, it is currently impossible to reconstitute the secretory stage extracellular matrix and recapitulate the formation of enamel crystals in vitro. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating dental enamel formation and to decisively characterize the normal temporal and spatial patterns of Enam expression, we have used gene targeting to knock out normal Enam expression, while replacing the 5′ Enam code with that of a β-galactosidase (β-gal) reporter in mice. We have demonstrated here that Enam is expressed solely and specifically by ameloblasts and that Enam-null mice do not make enamel because of a complete failure to mineralize at the appropriate place, resulting in the lack of a mineralization front at the secretory surface of the ameloblast. Animal Protocol—All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals at the University of Michigan. Knock-in Targeting Construct—Construction of the targeting vector started with pLOz (Ozgene Pty. Ltd., Murdoch, Western Australia), a modified pBlueScript SK vector containing a lacZ (β-galacatosidase) reporter with a mouse nuclear localization signal (NLS) upstream of a phosphoglycerine kinase (PGK) promoter driving a neomycin (Neo) selection marker, all inserted into the unique XbaI site in the multiple cloning region of the vector. The PGK-Neo code was flanked by loxP sites so that it could be deleted later by Cre recombinase (Cre). The Enam 5′-homology arm (5244 bp) was generated by PCR using 129Sv/j genomic DNA as template and ligated into the SalI site of pLOz. The Enam 3′ homology arm (5180 bp) starting in intron 7 and ending in intron 8 was inserted into the BamHI site. The final targeting construct (Fig. 1A) was characterized by DNA sequencing and restriction mapping, linearized by digestion with AclI, and transfected into embryonic stem cells by electroporation. Generation of Knock-in Mice—Successful homologous recombination in the embryonic stem cells that survived G418/gancyclovier positive-negative selection was screened for by Southern blot hybridization. Three correctly targeted clones were identified and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. The resultant female chimeras were mated to C57BL/6 males, and the offspring were analyzed for germ line transmission by Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 1B) using three probes. The 5′-probe (546 bp) was generated with primers 5′-CTTGCTGGTGACACTGAAGTTCC-3′ and 5′-ATTGGGGGTATGCTGTATGCC-3′ and hybridized against SphI-digested genomic DNA. Both the wild type (18.2 kbp) and the knock-in (11.1 kbp) bands were observed. The 3′-probe (564 bp) was generated with primers 5′-GGAGGAGCCCAGTGAAATAAGC-3′ and 5′CAGAAAGCAGAATGCCTTGGTG-3′ and hybridized against BamHI-digested genomic DNA. Both the wild type (28.7 kbp) and the knock-in (7.6 kbp) bands were observed. A knock-in-specific neomycin (Neo) probe (620 bp) was generated with primers 5′-GACTGGGCACAACAGACAATC-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCTCTTCAGCAATATCAC-3′ and hybridized against BamHI-digested genomic DNA to check for randomly integrated targeting vector. Only the band expected for the correctly targeted recombination (21.6 kbp) was observed. Five heterozygous offspring of the germ line chimera were mated with B6 Cre deleter mice to remove the PGK-Neo code. Three female and two male heterozygous mice were generated that survived. The presence or absence of a Neo cassette or Cre deleter sequence was determined by PCR analyses (Table 1). Wild type (Enam+/+), heterozygous (Enam+/lacZ or Enam+/-), and homozygous (EnamlacZ/lacZ or Enam-/-) were distinguished by PCR genotyping of genomic DNA obtained by tail biopsy (Fig. 1C) using primer pairs for β-globin, Enam exons 4/5, and lacZ. β-Globin was a positive control demonstrating adequate DNA template; a positive Enam band at 324 bp demonstrated the presence of at least one Enam allele. A positive lacZ band at 610 bp demonstrated the presence of at least one knock-in gene. The heterozygous Enam+/lacZ mice were backcrossed onto C57BL/6 for six generations, which established a breeding colony. All mice were maintained on moistened chow.TABLE 1PCR primers for genotypingTargetPrimer sequenceSizebpLacZTSF2: AAGTTTTGGGATTTGGCTCA610TSR2: GTTGCACCACAGATGAAACGExons 4 and 5E4/5F: GCCCAAAGCACAGTCATTTT324E4/5R: TAGGACCTGGCACGTGTCTCExon 6E6F: CATATGTGCAGGCAAACACC351E6R: ACAAACACAGCCCAGCTTCTExon 7E7F: GGGACGAAACTGGACTTCAA610E7R: ACAGGTGGGGACCTCTCTTTNeoNeo P1: AGGATCTCCTGTCATCTCACCTTGCTCCTG492Neo P2: AAGAACTCGTCAAGAAGGCGATAGAAGGCGNeoNeo P3: AGACAATCGGCTGCTCTGAT351Neo P4: ATACTTTCTCGGCAGGAGCACreCre F1: CGTACTGACGGTGGGAGAAT261Cre R1: TGCATGATCTCCGGTATTGAβ-GlobinFwd: CCAATCTGCTCACACAGGATAGAGAGGGCAGG494Rev: CCTTGAGGCTGTCCAAGTGATTCAGGCCATCG Open table in a new tab Physical Assessment and Blood Chemistry—The three mouse enamelin genotypes (+/+, +/-, -/-) were evaluated from birth for appearance, physical activity, size discrepancy, rate of growth, food intake, and reproductive physiology. Peripheral blood samples (n = 3) were collected from 6-week-old mice for each of the three genotypes, and a comprehensive panel of blood chemistry tests was performed at the Animal Diagnostic Laboratory of the University of Michigan. 3For detailed information on these analyses, contact the authors. β-Galactosidase (lacZ) Expression Assay—Mouse heads were collected from newborn mice up to 21 days of age, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and processed for β-galactosidase staining (44Lobe C.G.

The dissected tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 to 90 min according to the age of the mice and size of the tissue block, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times for 15 min each, and then decalcified in 10% EDTA for up to 7 days according to the age of the mice (47Rosen D. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1981; 7: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The decalcified tissues were washed three times in PBS (for 15 min) and embedded in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. compound (ProSciTech, Queensland, Australia). Tissue blocks were sectioned at 16-μm thickness, post-fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed three times in PBS (for min), and incubated at 45 °C for 3 h in freshly prepared X-gal staining buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mg/ml X-gal, 100 mm Hepes, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 1 mm MgCl2, 2% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (48Young D.C. Kingsley S.D. Ryan K.A. Dutko F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Tissue sections were rinsed and stored in PBS for counterstaining with hematoxylin and then observed under a dissection microscope (Nikon SMZ1000) or a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600). All images were captured using a digital camera (Nikon DXM1200) and Act1 imaging software (Mager Scientific, Dexter, MI). Extraction and Analysis of Tooth Proteins—Day 7 mouse pups were decapitated, and the mandibles were removed and placed on ice in a Petri dish. The incisors and first molars were extracted using fine point tissue forceps under a dissecting microscope, and the soft tissues (pulp and enamel organ) were removed and placed in PBS on ice. Incisors and molars for each enamelin genotype were pooled, weighed, and extracted with 0.8 ml of 0.5 m acetic acid containing 0.5 mm benzamidine and 1,10-phenanthrolin while shaking at 4 °C overnight. On days 2 and 3 the teeth were pelleted by centrifugation and again extracted with 0.5 m acetic acid. The supernatants were combined, desalted using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare), lyophilized, and weighed, and 5 μg of protein was dissolved in 15 μl of SDS sample buffer. Each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE on three different gels. One gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue; the others were transblotted to membranes and blocked with milk proteins for Western blot analyses. One membrane was immunostained using polyclonal rabbit antibodies (1:2000) against rM179 amelogenin (49Simmer J.P. Lau E.C. Hu C.C. Aoba T. Lacey M. Nelson D. Zeichner-David M. Snead M.L. Slavkin H.C. Fincham A.G. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); the other membrane was immunostained using affinity-purified rabbit antibodies (1:1000) raised against the enamelin peptide EQDFEKPKEKDPPK and designated Enam221. After washing with PBS, the blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:10,000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Amelogenin was detected by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride staining, and enamelin was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; GE Healthcare Biosciences). Eruption Rate Determination—The eruption rates of mandibular incisors from each of the three genotypes at ages 5-6 weeks were determined (50Ness A.R. Arch. Oral Biol. 1965; 10: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 51Hwang W.S. Tonna E.A. J. Dent. Res. 1965; 44: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mice received inhalation anesthesia, isoflurane, at the surgical room at Dental Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine for the incisor notching procedure. One dose of analgesic, buprenorphine (0.2 mg/25 gm body weight), was given intramuscularly immediately before the procedure for pain control. A dental handpiece with a sterile, round bur size (¼) was used to create a circular lesion 1 mm in diameter in the mandibular buccal plate and penetrate the enamel and dentin of the incisor. Hemostasis was achieved by using a cotton pellet, direct pressure, and buffered aluminum chloride epinephrine-free hemostatic liquid (Hemodent™, Primer USA). The mice were euthanized after 10 days, and the hemi-mandibles were dissected and radiographed at ×5 magnification. The incisors were traced on a view box, and the distance between the notch on the bone and the notch on the incisor was measured with a Vernier Caliper three times per sample. The distance between the stationary mark in the bone and the mark on the erupting incisor was divided by the amount of time that had elapsed since the marks were made, providing the eruption rate. Statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance was performed. Radiography—Hemi-mandibles of 2-week-old Enam+/+, Enam+/-, and Enam+/- mice were freed from soft tissues and radiographed using a Faxitron™ x-ray cabinet (model MX-20, Faxitron X-ray Corp., Wheeling, IL) operating at 30 kV. Mandibles from three mice from each of the three genotypes were evaluated and compared using digital micrographs obtained under identical Faxitron settings. Microcomputed Tomography—Microcomputed tomography was performed on hemi-mandibles at the level of the first molar from three samples of each genotype (model 1072; Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium). The x-ray source was operated at maximum power (80 KeV) and at 100 μA. Images were captured using a 12-bit, cooled, charge-coupled device camera (1024 × 1024 pixels) coupled by a fiber optic taper to the scintillator. Using a rotation step of 0.9°, total scanning time was 35 min for each rotated sample, after which ∼300 sections (slice-to-slice distance of 16.5 μm) were reconstructed using Skyscan tomography software based on triangular surface rendering to give a three-dimensional distribution of the calcified tissue. Appropriate imaging planes selected to show three-dimensionalized longitudinal “sections” (segments) of the first molar and cross-sections of the underlying incisor were selected using a limited number of acquired x-ray slices. Histologic Evaluation of Mandibular First Molars at 7 Days—Light microscopy of undecalcified mandibles at the level of the unerupted first molar was performed on wild type, heterozygous, and enamelin-null mice at 1 week of age. Mandibles were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in LR White acrylic resin (London Resin Co., Berkshire, UK). Heat-polymerized blocks were sectioned with a diamond knife on an ultramicrotome (model Reichert Ultracut E, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) to produce 0.5 μm-thick sections. Von Kossa staining for mineral was performed by applying 3% silver nitrate to the sections and exposing them to bright light for 30 min. Sections were counterstained for tissue and cell morphology using toluidine blue. Light micrographs were obtained using a Sony DXC-950 3-CCD camera (Sony, Tokyo, Japan) mounted on an optical microscope (model Leitz DMRBE, Leica). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Evaluation of Mandibular First Molars at 7 Days—Mandibles from 1-week-old mice (n = 3 for each of the three genotypes) were fractured with a razor blade at the level of the first molar, critical-point dried, and mounted with conductive carbon cement onto metallic stubs. Samples were sputter-coated with a 20-nm-thick AuPd film to increase conductivity and imaged with a field-emission gun scanning electron microscope (model S-4700, Hitachi High Technologies America, Pleasanton, CA) operating in the secondary electron detection mode at an accelerating voltage of 3-5 kV. SEM Evaluation of Molars and Incisors at 7 Weeks—Rehydrated freeze-dried mandibular jaws from 7-week-old wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous knock-in mice were washed briefly in diluted sodium hypochlorite solution, rinsed in deionized water, and examined without coating in backscatter mode using a JEOL-JSM6460LV (JEOL Ltd., Japan) SEM operated at 20 kV. Incisor and molar samples were fractured and mounted and coated with AuPd film and evaluated using a JEOL JSM 6300. Incremental Mineral Contents of Incisor Enamel at Week 7—Male and female mice at 7 weeks of age were randomly selected and euthanized for tissue collection. Hemi-mandibles and hemi-maxillae were removed, quickly cleaned of adhering soft tissues, and flash-frozen in prechilled containers immersed in dry ice. The tissues were then freeze-dried for 48 h at -55 °C. The bone and enamel organs covering the freeze-dried incisors were removed, and the exposed enamel surfaces were wiped gently with dry Kimwi"
https://openalex.org/W2133971099,"The sulfated polysaccharide carrageenan (CGN) induces activation of NFkappaB and interleukin 8 (IL-8) in human colonic epithelial cells through a pathway of innate immunity mediated by Bcl10 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10). In this report, we identify Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a member of the family of innate immune receptors, as the surface membrane receptor for CGN in human colonic epithelial cells. Experiments with fluorescence-tagged CGN demonstrated a marked reduction in binding of CGN to human intestinal epithelial cells and to RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages, following exposure to TLR4 blocking antibody (HTA-125). Binding of CGN to 10ScNCr/23 mouse macrophages, which are deficient in the genetic locus for TLR4, was absent. Additional experiments with TLR4 blocking antibody and TLR4 small interfering RNAs showed 80% reductions in CGN-induced increases in Bcl10 and IL-8. Transfection with dominant-negative MyD88 plasmid demonstrated MyD88 dependence of the CGN-TLR4-triggered increases in Bcl10 and IL-8. Therefore, these results indicate that CGN-induced inflammation in human colonocytes proceeds through a pathway of innate immunity, perhaps related to the unusual alpha-1,3-galactosidic linkage characteristic of CGN, and suggest how dietary CGN intake may contribute to human intestinal inflammation. Because CGN is a commonly used food additive in the Western diet, clarification of its effects and mechanisms of action are vital to issues of food safety."
https://openalex.org/W2019483572,"Reversible acetylation of lysine residues within a protein is considered a biologically relevant modification that rivals phosphorylation (Kouzarides, T. (2000) EMBO J. 19, 1176-1179). The enzymes responsible for such protein modification are called histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs). A role of protein phosphorylation in regulating muscle contraction is well established (Solaro, R. J., Moir, A. J., and Perry, S. V. (1976) Nature 262, 615-617). Here we show that reversible protein acetylation carried out by HATs and HDACs also plays a role in regulating the myofilament contractile activity. We found that a Class II HDAC, HDAC4, and an HAT, PCAF, associate with cardiac myofilaments. Primary cultures of cardiomyocytes as well as mouse heart sections examined by immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses revealed that both HDAC4 and PCAF associate with the Z-disc and I- and A-bands of cardiac sacromeres. Increased acetylation of sarcomeric proteins by HDAC inhibition (using class I and II HDAC inhibitors or anti-HDAC4 antibody) enhanced the myofilament calcium sensitivity. We identified the Z-disc-associated protein, MLP, a sensor of cardiac mechanical stretch, as an acetylated target of PCAF and HDAC4. We also show that trichostatin-A, a class I and II HDAC inhibitor, increases myofilament calcium sensitivity of wild-type, but not of MLP knock-out mice, thus demonstrating a role of MLP in acetylation-dependent increased contractile activity of myofilaments. These studies provide the first evidence that HATs and HDACs play a role in regulation of muscle contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2069136488,"Knowledge of rates of protein turnover is important for a quantitative understanding of tissue synthesis and catabolism. In this work, we have used the racemization of aspartic acid as a marker for the turnover of collagen obtained from healthy and pathological human intervertebral disc matrices. We measured the ratio of the d- and l-isomers in collagen extracted from these tissues as a function of age between 16 and 77 years. For collagen taken from healthy discs, the fractional increase of d-Asp was found to be 6.74 × 10–4/year; for degenerate discs, the corresponding rate was 5.18 × 10–4/year. Using the racemization rate found previously for the stable population of collagen molecules in dentin, we found that the rate of collagen turnover (kT) in discs is not constant but rather a decreasing function of age. The average turnover rate in normal disc between the ages of 20 and 40 is 0.00728 ± 0.00275/year, and that between the ages of 50 and 80 is 0.00323 ± 0.000947/year, which correspond to average half-lives of 95 and 215 years, respectively. Turnover of collagen from degenerate discs may be more rapid than that found for normal discs; however, statistical analysis leaves this point uncertain. The finding of a similar correlation between the accumulation of d-Asp and that of pentosidine for three normal collagenous tissues further supports the idea that the accumulation of pentosidine in a particular tissue can, along with the racemization of aspartic acid, be used as a reliable measure of protein turnover.

These cells have the essential function of maintaining and repairing the matrix by synthesizing matrix macromolecules and by producing degradative enzymes, including metalloproteinases and their inhibitors (TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase)), which are all involved in tissue metabolism and turnover. Thus, normal disc function is dependent on a balance between synthesis and matrix breakdown.The fine balance between synthesis and degradation determines the concentrations of tissue components and hence the composition of the tissue.

Normally, when a balance is maintained, damaged tissue can be restored by cellular repair responses; otherwise, the matrix composition and organization are altered, and the cellular repair responses become inadequate. Hence, the degraded matrix can no longer carry loads effectively, which leads to the degeneration of the disc.During aging, many changes involving the proportions and biochemical properties of the matrix occur. These processes include, for example, the degradation and formation of lower molecular weight species with different turnover rates, as in the case of aggrecan (9Sivan S. Tsitron E. Wachtel E.

Such changes in the “molecular age” of protein-containing molecules can, in principle, be probed by measuring the accumulation of the d-aspartic acid isomer and, using this value, calculating the residence time of these molecules. In nature, amino acids are synthesized as l-isomers. Spontaneous racemization slowly converts the l-form of amino acids via a non-enzymatic reaction or sequence of reactions into a racemic mixture of l- and d-forms. Aspartic acid is one of the most rapidly racemizing of the amino acids (10Helfman P.M. Bada J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2891-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 11Bada J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 98-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), allowing the concentration of d-isomers to reach measurable levels in proteins that are not renewed or that slowly turn over in living subjects. It is well known that an age-dependent racemization occurs in various human and animal tissues containing metabolically stable, long-lived proteins (12Man E.H. Sandhouse M.E. Burg J. Fisher G.H.

In this work, we assessed the turnover of collagen molecules in healthy and pathological human discs using the racemization of aspartic acid as a probe.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue Sampling—Healthy (ages 22–62, n = 9) and pathological (ages 16–77, n = 23) discs from lumbar and thoracic spines were obtained post mortem or during routine surgical procedures for treatment of scoliosis, disc degeneration, or herniation. In this study, healthy discs will be referred to as “normal” and pathological ones (obtained from cases of scoliosis, IVD herniation, spinal canal stenosis, and fusion procedures) as “degenerate.” No scoring of the tissue was performed. All discs were divided into nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) zones and stored at –20 °C until further analyzed.Purification of Collagen—Collagen was purified by depleting the tissue of all the proteoglycans and non-collagenous protein using sequential enzymatic treatment with chondroitinase ABC (0.125 units/ml in 0.05 m Tris buffer containing 0.06 m sodium acetate, pH 8.0, for 24 h at 25 °C), Streptomyces hyaluronidase (1 unit/ml in 0.05 m Tris buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6.0, for 24 h at 25 °C) and trypsin (1 mg/ml in 0.05 m NaHPO4 containing 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2, for 16 h at 25 °C) as described previously by Schmidt et al. (21Schmidt M.B. Mow V.C. Chun L.E. Eyre D.R. J. Orthop. Res. 1990; 8: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Using this method, >97% of the non-collagenous molecules are removed from the tissue (17Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Oldehinkel E. Bank R.A. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Bayliss M.T. Bijlsma J.W.J. Lafeber F.P.J.G. TeKoppele J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar); this does not include elastin, which is 1.7 ± 0.2% of the total dry weight in human IVD (22Mikawa Y. Hamagami H. Shikata J. Yamamuro T. Arch. Orthop. Trauma Surg. 1986; 105: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Collagen content on a dry tissue basis was determined by hydroxyproline analysis (23Stageman H. Stadler K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 18: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar) of papain-digested tissue samples using a conversion factor of 7.6 (24Adams P. Muir H. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1976; 35: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Determination of Percentage d-Aspartic Acid—Determination of the d/l-Asp ratio was carried out using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) according to Verzijl et al. (16Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Thorpe S.R. Bank R.A. Shaw J.N. Lyons T.J. Bijlsma J.W.J. Lafeber F.P.J.G. Baynes J.W. TeKoppele J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39027-39031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and Aswad (25Aswad D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). All d/l-Asp data were corrected for the amount of d- and l-Asp present in papain and for racemization during the hydrolysis step. Correction was made by subtracting the d/l-Asp ratio measured for young bovine type II collagen.Calculation of Rates of Protein Turnover—Accumulation of d-Asp depends upon competition between two linear processes. These are described by the rate constants of racemization (ki) and protein turnover (kT). When the amount of d-isomer is very small (d/l < 0.15), racemization may be considered irreversible. This is indeed the case in the tissues discussed here. The time rate of change of the amount of d-isomer in a protein can be written as in Equation 1 (26Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitel-kaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), d(CAsp(D)/(D+L))/dt=kiCAsp(L)/(D+L)-kTCAsp(D)/(D+L)(Eq. 1) where CAsp is the molar concentration of aspartic acid in the protein and d/(d + l) and l/(d + l) represent the fractions of the l- and d-isomers, respectively. Assuming that the content of the d-isomer is small enough that d/(d + l) ≈ (d/l) and l/(d + l) ≈ 1, which is the case in vivo, Equation 1 can be rewritten as in Equation 2, d(D/L)/dt=ki-kT(D/L)(Eq. 2) When the ratio d/l and/or the turnover rate constant kT is very small, then the rate of change of d/l will be approximately linear with time. Then ki can be approximated by the accumulation rate. When the amount of d/l becomes relatively large and/or the turnover rate is significant, the time rate of change of d/l will no longer be constant but rather will decrease with age. However, if the turnover rate itself is not constant but rather decreases, then the time rate of change of d/l need not decrease with age. If kT can be determined, then the half-life (t½) of the collagen molecules is calculated as in Equation 3, t1/2=ln(2)/kT(Eq. 3) Measurement of in Vitro Rate Constants for Aspartic Acid Racemization—This was based on the procedure by Ohtani (27Ohtani S. Am. J. Forensic Med. Pathol. 1998; 19: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Dry collagen samples extracted from the NP (4–7 mg) were placed in glass tubes and heated at 120, 140, 160, or 180 °C for 5–90 min. Samples were digested in papain (5 units/ml in papain buffer, 100 μl/mg of collagen), and the racemization of aspartic acid (i.e. the d/l-Asp ratio) was determined after hydrolysis as described above.Amino acid racemization in vitro follows first-order kinetics as described by Equation 4, ln((1+D/L)/(1-D/L))t=2ki*×t+ln((1+D/L)/(1-D/L))t=0(Eq. 4) in which, as defined above, d/l is the ratio of d- to l-Asp, t is the time of heating, ki*isthe in vitro rate constant for aspartic acid racemization, and the logarithmic term evaluated at t = 0 describes the amount of d-Asp isomer measured in unheated collagen. The Arrhenius equation was used to determine the activation energy for the racemization of aspartic acid residues. This equation gives a logarithmic relationship between the inverse temperature and the reaction rate (28Arrhenius S. Z. Phys. Chem. 1889; 4: 226-248Crossref Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 5, ln(ki*)=-Ea/RT+constant(Eq. 5) where Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The racemization rate was evaluated at each temperature using Equation 1. Only data that showed a linear increase in ln((1 + d/l)/(1–d/l)) with time and a correlation constant r > 0.98 were used. Values of ln(ki*) were plotted against the reciprocal of the absolute temperature. A linear fit to Equation 2 gives the activation energy as the slope.Pentosidine and Amino Acid Contents—These were determined by HPLC as described previously (29Bank R.A. Jansen E.J. Beekman B. TeKoppele J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 30Bank R.A. Beekman B. Vezijl N. de Roose J.A. Sakkee A.N. TeKoppele J.M. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1997; 703: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Samples were hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl at 100 °C for 20–24 h and dried. Samples were then dissolved in an internal standard solution containing 10 μm pyridoxine and 2.4 mm homoarginine. For pentosidine analysis, samples were diluted 5-fold with 0.5% (v/v) heptafluorobutyric acid in 10% (v/v) acetonitrile and analyzed by HPLC. An aliquot of the samples used for pentosidine analysis was diluted 50-fold with 1 m sodium borate buffer, pH 11.4, and derivatized with 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate for HPLC amino acid analysis. The pentosidine content of the collagen samples was calculated based on hydroxyproline measurements (23Stageman H. Stadler K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 18: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 24Adams P. Muir H. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1976; 35: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and is expressed as μmol/mol of Lys based on 2 × 10–4 mol of Lys/g of collagen (18Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Bank R. Bayliss M.T.

Acta. 1967; 18: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—Linear regression analysis, two-factor analysis of variance, and Student's paired t tests were performed; p < 0.05 was considered to represent a statistically significant difference.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn Vitro Rate Constant of Aspartic Acid Racemization in Human Disc Collagen from NP—Maroudas et al. (31Maroudas A. Palla G. Gilav E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) suggested that the rate of racemization for collagen molecules may be independent of the tissue of origin. This idea was subsequently supported by heating experiments (16Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Thorpe S.R. Bank R.A. Shaw J.N. Lyons T.J. Bijlsma J.W.J. Lafeber F.P.J.G. Baynes J.W. TeKoppele J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39027-39031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) showing that the in vitro activation energies (derived from an Arrhenius plot) for racemization are similar for skin (type I collagen) and cartilage (type II collagen). Our in vitro racemization data for collagen from the NP of normal IVD (mostly type II collagen) also are similar. The quantitative relation between the in vitro rate constants for racemization of aspartic acid (ki*) and the reciprocal of the absolute temperature (1/T) according to the Arrhenius equation (Equation 5) is shown in Fig. 1. Also shown are data from human and bovine cartilage and bovine skin (16Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Thorpe S.R. Bank R.A. Shaw J.N. Lyons T.J. Bijlsma J.W.J. Lafeber F.P.J.G. Baynes J.W. TeKoppele J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39027-39031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). To compare our values for the in vitro rate constant with those obtained earlier for skin and cartilage collagen (16Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Thorpe S.R. Bank R.A. Shaw J.N. Lyons T.J. Bijlsma J.W.J. Lafeber F.P.J.G. Baynes J.W. TeKoppele J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39027-39031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), the linear curve in Fig. 1 was extrapolated to 33 °C. The rate constant obtained for disc collagen is 1.46 × 10–6/year compared with 1.78 × 10–6/year and 1.71 × 10–6/year for skin and cartilage collagen, respectively (16Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Thorpe S.R. Bank R.A. Shaw J.N. Lyons T.J. Bijlsma J.W.J. Lafeber F.P.J.G. Baynes J.W. TeKoppele J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39027-39031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar).It should be noted that measurements carried out at high, non-physiological temperatures for relatively short times (up to 90 min) monitor the thermally driven racemization of collagen with essentially no turnover at all. In this case, the accumulation rate and the racemization rate are the same. The fact that the activation energy is similar for skin, cartilage, and disc NP supports pooling tissue samples containing type I and II collagens (e.g. AF and NP in discs) for racemization measurements. The fact that the in vitro racemization rates are >2 orders of magnitude smaller than the in vivo accumulation rates (16Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Thorpe S.R. Bank R.A. Shaw J.N. Lyons T.J. Bijlsma J.W.J.

These results further suggest that under the same environmental conditions, both types of collagen will undergo racemization at the same rate.In Vivo Accumulation of d-Asp in Collagen from Normal and Degenerate Discs—This (expressed as the ratio of d- to l-Asp) increased linearly with age in all collagen samples (Fig. 2). Because no significant difference was observed in the rate of d-isomer accumulation in NP compared with AF (p > 0.05), data were pooled for both normal and degenerate tissues. Fitting the increase of d-Asp as a function of age to a linear curve resulted in an accumulation rate of 6.74 × 10–4/year for normal collagen and 5.18 × 10–4/year for degenerate collagen. Using linear regression analysis, we found no statistical significance in the difference between these two rates. The accumulation rate of the merged data sets is 5.89 × 10–4/year. There is no indication that the slope of the curve decreases with age for either the normal or degenerate samples. Table 1 shows a comparison of the accumulation rates in human IVD and collagenous tissues for which racemization has been studied (9Sivan S. Tsitron E. Wachtel E. Roughley P.

Int. 2004; 141: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The different rates observed may be due to different values of ki, kT, or both. Except for dentin, normal collagen in IVD experiences the most rapid accumulation of d-Asp. In Fig. 3, data for d/l-Asp are also pooled by decade. Using two-factor analysis of variance on the histogrammed data in Fig. 3, a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the mean values of d/l-Asp in normal and degenerate tissues was found only above 60 years of age (p > 0.05). This difference may be due to the fact that fewer samples of normal tissue up to age 62 were available, whereas samples of degenerate tissue up to age 77 could be analyzed.FIGURE 2d/l-Asp in collagen obtained from normal (▴) and degenerate (○) human IVD tissues as a function of donor age. Because of an insignificant difference (p > 0.05, t test) between NP and AF of the same tissue, the data were pooled. The similar r values for the two data sets suggest that there is no additional contribution to the scatter of the degenerate data points due to the pooling of tissues with different pathologies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Accumulation rates for the d-isomer of aspartic acid in collagen obtained from normal and degenerate human IVD calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures”FractionAccumulation rateSource×10-4/yearNP + AF Normal6.74This work Degenerate5.18This workDentin7.74-8.34Refs. 9Sivan S.

As shown in Equation 2, the amount of d-Asp will grow approximately linearly with age in stable populations of protein where the turnover is very slow, whereas when the turnover is more rapid, the rate of growth will decrease with time. A rapid turnover implies a short residence time and frequent population renewal, whereas a slow turnover implies a long residence time, suggesting that it is more difficult for cells to repair defects, which therefore may accumulate with aging. In proteins with very rapid turnover, such as hemoglobin, accumulation of d-Asp is negligible during the human lifetime (10Helfman P.M. Bada J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2891-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).How do the structural and chemical characteristics of the particular tissue influence the rate of racemization of aspartic acid in collagen? The process of racemization depends on time, temperature, and, less strongly, pH (11Bada J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 98-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Bada (33Bada J.L. Earth Planetary Sci. Lett. 1981; 55: 292-298Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) derived an empirical equation for the temperature dependence of the racemization constant (Equation 6), ki(T)=ki(310)×exp(-(16,890×(310-T)/(T×310)))(Eq. 6) where the temperature is given in units of Kelvin. This equation predicts, for example, that the racemization constant at 33 °C would be approximately half as large as that at 37 °C. As far as pH is concerned, we are not aware of any systematic study of the dependence of ki on pH. A low pH environment is known to promote the inversion of l- to d-aspartate (34Masters P.M. Biological Markers of Aging.in: Reff M.E. Schneider E.L. NIH Publication 82-2221. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1982: 120-137Google Scholar, 35Masters P.M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1983; 35: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The disc has a moderately low pH: it varies from 7.2 to 6.6, the lower limit of this range being found under conditions of degeneration (36Razaq S. Wilkins R.J. Urban J.P. Eur. Spine J. 2003; 12: 342-349Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The carboxyl and sulfonic groups of the glycosaminoglycan molecules in the extracellular matrix contribute to the low pH environment of collagen. The relatively low pH in the disc is also due to the production of lactic acid as a by-product of metabolic processes (37Antoniou J. Steffen T. Nelson F. Winterbottom N. Hollander A.P. Poole R.A. Aebi M. Alini M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). In addition, under conditions of low pH, protein synthesis is significantly reduced (37Antoniou J. Steffen T. Nelson F. Winterbottom N. Hollander A.P. Poole R.A. Aebi M. Alini M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar).Of the five tissues listed in Table 1, collagen in dentin is considered to be the most stable during the human lifetime (11Bada J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 98-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), i.e. turnover is negligible, and therefore the accumulation rate is assumed to be equal to ki. This value of ki is thus a characteristic of collagen molecules under the conditions prevailing at the tissue site. To estimate collagen turnover (kT) as a function of age for normal and degenerate IVD, we make the assumption that the pH and temperature of the disc and tooth are the same. We used the value for ki of dentin, i.e. 7.6 × 10–4/year (11Bada J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 98-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), in Equation 2 and solved for kT. Values for d/l-Asp are taken from Fig. 1 and those for accumulation rates (d/dt(d/l-Asp)) from the linear fits in Fig. 1. The results are shown in Fig. 4 (a and b). If the temperature at the site of the dentin is lower than that at the disc, then the ki value for dentin that we used in Equation 2 must be increased according to Equation 6. The smooth curves describe the expected values for kT if the mean temperature at the site of the dentin is 1 °C lower than that of the IVD. We found that kT is a decreasing function of age and is consistently higher for degenerate IVD compared with normal IVD. For normal IVD, the average turnover rate between ages 20 and 40 is 0.00728 ± 0.00275/year, and that between ages 50 and 80 is 0.00323 ± 0.000947/year, which correspond to half-lives of 95 and 215 years, respectively. For comparison, in human IVD, Antoniou et al. (37Antoniou J. Steffen T. Nelson F. Winterbottom N. Hollander A.P. Poole R.A. Aebi M. Alini M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) found that between the ages of 15 and 40, there is a progressive reduction in the synthesis of type II procollagen and a small reduction in the prevalence of degradation products of collagen. Between the ages of 40 and 60, collagen synthesis continues to decrease. Similar behavior is observed in the oldest age group (60–80 years), except for a weak increase in synthesis of type I collagen (37Antoniou J. Steffen T. Nelson F. Winterbottom N. Hollander A.P.

It therefore appears that the rate of collagen turnover in human IVD, as determined here, and collagen synthesis in the disc as determine"
https://openalex.org/W2125415514,"The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is required for adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis and for male sexual differentiation. StAR acts on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to facilitate movement of cholesterol from the OMM to the inner mitochondrial membrane to be converted to pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroid hormones. The mechanisms of the action of StAR remain unclear; the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, an OMM protein, appears to be involved, but the identity of OMM proteins that interact with StAR remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylated StAR interacts with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) on the OMM, which then facilitates processing of the 37-kDa phospho-StAR to the 32-kDa intermediate. In the absence of VDAC1, phospho-StAR is degraded by cysteine proteases prior to mitochondrial import. Phosphorylation of StAR by protein kinase A requires phosphate carrier protein on the OMM, which appears to interact with StAR before it interacts with VDAC1.

StAR moves cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) where it is converted to pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroid hormones (Fig. 1A).

Despite intense investigation, the mechanisms of the action of StAR on the OMM remain unknown. Several models have been proposed to explain the mechanism of StAR action (6Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 589-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Much attention has focused on the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), an OMM protein that appears to be involved in steroidogenesis (7Lacapere J.J. Papadopoulos V. Steroids. 2003; 68: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), but despite evidence for a functional interaction between PBR and StAR (8Hauet T. Yao Z.X. Bose H.S. Wall C.T. Han Z. Li W.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 540-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the identity of the OMM proteins with which StAR interacts remains undefined. Here we demonstrate that StAR interacts with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), and with phosphate carrier protein (PCP) on the OMM to initiate the action of StAR. VDAC1 and PCP are the first OMM proteins definitively shown to interact with StAR. Reagents and Antibodies—Antibodies against VDAC1, PCP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, PBR and COX IV were from Chemicon, Sigma, Calbiochem, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The generation of antiserum against bacterially expressed human StAR, which detects both phospho- and dephospho-StAR, has been described (9Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Antiserum specific for phospho-StAR was a gift from Dr. Steven King (10Manna P.R. Chandrala S.P. King S.R. Jo Y.

Reprod. 2005; 73: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Rabbit IgG was from Sigma, protein A beads were from Amersham Biosciences, and 2,4-dinitrophenol from Riedel-de Haen (Germany). Dithiocyanate was from Serva/Invitrogen, and 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate was from Research Organics. RNase A and Proteinase K were from Roche and GE Health-care, and digitonin was from Calbiochem. Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technology (Ames, IA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. Plasmid Construction, Cell Culture, Transfection, Mitochondrial Isolation, and Western Blotting—Construction of full-length StAR, R182L StAR, P450scc, and SCC/N-62 StAR cDNA expression vectors was described elsewhere (3Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For the StAR-DHFR fusion, residues 1 to 284 of StAR were fused to residues 2 to 224 of DHFR deleting the StAR stop codon and cloned in SP6 vector (3Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Cell culture, transfections, and mitochondrial isolation from cultured cells were performed as described (3Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In all cases 100 ng/ml trilostane (Steraloids, Los Angeles, CA) was added as an inhibitor of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Media were collected from cultures 48 h after transfection and assayed for pregnenolone by radioimmunoassay (MP Biomedicals) as described (1Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in 1× SDS sample buffer (0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 10 mm dithiothreitol), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated in 1:100 dilutions of primary antibody, with the exception of anti-StAR antiserum (1:10,000) and anti-phosphoserine StAR antiserum (1:800). For mitochondrial isolation from adrenal tissue, sheep adrenals were isolated immediately after sacrifice. Adrenal tissue was placed in pre-chilled mitochondria isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 40 μg/ml protease mixture (Roche)). Tissue was then homogenized in an all glass, hand-held Dounce homogenizer with 12 up and down strokes, and cleared of debris by centrifugation at 3,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (mitochondrial fraction) was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and the resulting mitochondrial pellet was washed twice and re-pelleted at 3,500 × g. For storage, pellets were suspended in import buffer (125 mm sucrose, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm NADH, 50 mm KCl, 0.05 mm ADP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm sodium succinate, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 10 μl of creatine kinase (4 mg/ml), 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4), and frozen in liquid N2 for in vitro bioactivity and protein import (12Alconada A.

Chemical Cross-linking—Disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) was dissolved in Me2SO and sequentially diluted with import buffer just before cross-linking. Freshly isolated mitochondria from adrenal tissues (100 μg) were incubated with cell-free synthesized [35S]StAR for 15 min at 20 °C. Disuccinimidyl suberate was then added directly to the reaction mixture, to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and incubated at 4 °C and at room temperature for 5 min to 2 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mm Tris, pH 9.5, and 1× SDS sample buffer. Samples were then boiled for 15 min and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The darker radioactive band was excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Equivalent results were obtained with three other homobifunctional cross-linking agents: disuccinimidyl glutarate, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. Mass Spectrometry—Excised bands were processed for mass spectrometry in an automated in-gel tryptic digestion (“Waters MassPREP Station” system, Waters, MA). Following electrophoresis, blue native-PAGE gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, washed with water for 24 h, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The radioactive gel bands were excised, reduced, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin (Promega Sequencing grade modified). The resulting peptides were analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS (Waters) coupled with a Q-ToF-2 mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK/Waters, MA). Proteins were identified from MS/MS spectra by searching the NCBI non-redundant data base using Mas-cot MS/MS Ion Search (Matrix Science, UK). Search parameters included carbamidomethylation of cysteine, possible oxidation of methionine, and one missed cleavage per peptide. In our experiment, an individual ion score greater than 39 (–10 log(P) at 95% confidence) indicated extensive homology; mass spectrometry scores ranged from 60 to 438. Immunoprecipitation—Total digitonin extracts or fractions from sucrose density gradients were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture. The protein-IgG complex was harvested with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, eluted by boiling for 15 min in 1× SDS-sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Köenig's Polyanion Treatment—Köenig's polyanion (15Mangan P.S. Colombini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4896-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (KPA, a kind gift from Dr. Marco Colombini, University of Maryland) was dissolved in 10 mm NaOH, adjusted to pH 7.0 with 50 mm NaOAc, pH 4.0, and stored at 4 °C. Prior to use, the solution was equilibrated with import buffer or media as required. Two different concentrations of KPA (30 and 90 mg/ml) were incubated with COS-1 cells 24 h prior to co-transfection with StAR and the F2 fusion of the cholesterol side chain cleavage system (H2N-P450scc-AdRed-Adx-COOH) (16Harikrishna J.A. Black S.M. Szklarz G.D. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Pregnenolone concentrations in the media were then determined, and cell lysates were analyzed for StAR processing by Western blot. Western blot signals were developed by West-Pico chemilumiscent reagent (Pierce). For direct measurement of activity, mitochondria (2 μg of protein) were incubated with the above mentioned concentration of KPA for 2 h and then incubated with biosynthetic StAR. For transient VDAC channel blockage, mitochondria were incubated with 30 mg/ml KPA, re-isolated, and resuspended in import buffer. For analysis of StAR mitochondrial import, 100 μg of mitochondria were incubated with cell-free synthesized [35S]StAR in the presence of 10 to 90 mg/ml KPA. Mitochondrial [35S]StAR was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Blocking Phosphate Carrier Protein—Mitochondria (20 mg of protein) isolated from adrenal tissues were incubated with 2 mm phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) or sulfo-PITC for 10 min on ice, and reactions were terminated by adding 10 mm dithiocyanate. Mitochondria were then washed twice with 10 mm dithiocyanate, resuspended in import buffer, and incubated with cell-free synthesized [35S]StAR for 2 h at 26 °C. In some cases, 1 mm ATP was included in the reaction mixture. Mitochondrial import was examined by analyzing a 20-μl aliquot by SDS-PAGE. Antibody Shift Native-PAGE and Blocking Experiments—Cell-free synthesized [35S]StAR was imported into mitochondria (20 μg of protein) from MA-10 cells or sheep adrenals for 10 min. Mitochondria were then resuspended in 100 μl of mitochondria isolation buffer and incubated with antiserum (suspended in 40 μl of import buffer) for 30 min on ice. Reisolated mitochondria were washed with import buffer two times and extracted in digitonin buffer (1% digitonin) and analyzed by native-PAGE (17Wiedemann N. Kozak V. Chacinska A. Schonfisch B. Rosepert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). For antibody blocking experiments, mitochondria were incubated with IgG or VDAC1 antiserum to VDAC1 prior to import. Bioactivity in Isolated Mitochondria—Mitochondria (2 μgof protein) from control or VDAC1 knockdown MA-10 cells or from adrenal tissues were resuspended in a final volume of 100 μl of bioassay buffer (125 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm isocitrate, 25 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm ATP, and 10 mg/ml cholesterol, pH 7.4), incubated with full-length, cell-free synthesized or biosynthetic StAR under the conditions described (3Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Supernatants were then assayed for pregnenolone by radioimmunoassay (1Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Generation of VDAC1 Antiserum—Antiserum specific to VDAC1 was custom raised by Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX) against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 151–165. New Zealand White rabbits received an initial injection of keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide and 14 days later received an additional injection, followed by a booster injection on every 7th day to day 63. At this time, the antiserum titer exceeded 1:1000, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Rabbits were then sacrificed and all serum was collected. The affinity purification of VDAC1 antibody was carried out after cross-linking a peptide corresponding to residues 151–165 of VDAC1 with a SulfoLink column following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce, Sulfolink Immobilization kit). The SulfoLink column was equilibrated at room temperature with coupling buffer. Peptide-(151–165) (1 mg) was dissolved in coupling buffer, then coupled with the resin by mixing 15 min at room temperature on a rocker followed by an additional 30 min of incubation without rocking. The unbound peptide was removed by centrifugation and three washes with coupling buffer, then nonspecific sites of the column were blocked with 50 mm l-cysteine. Before purification, the column was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. The antiserum was purified in batches. Antiserum (2 ml) was incubated with the column on a rocker for 30 min, the unbound antibodies were removed, and the column was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 mm NaCl and eluted with 100 mm glycine at pH 3.0, which was immediately titrated by addition of 65 μl of 1.0 m Tris, pH 9.5. The purified antiserum was dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline. VDAC1 Knockdown and Development of Stable Cell Lines—siRNA (CCCUAAAACCAGGUAUCAA) for VDAC1 was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). COS-1 and MA-10 cells were transfected with 30 and 60 pmol of VDAC1 siRNA, respectively, using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (Ambion) served as a control in all experiments. A combination of two non-targeting scrambled siRNAs (Ambion) was also included as control in all experiments. A subset of cells was co-transfected with an expression vector for VDAC1 cDNA in which two nucleotides in the siRNA target region were mutated. VDAC1 was mutated without altering the amino acid sequence as follows: CCCTAAAA(C→T)CA(G→A)GTATCAA. The pSilencer siRNA expression plasmid was constructed by ligating the 55-mer siRNA template into a pSilencer 4.1 CMV expression vector (Ambion, TX). Complementary 55-mer siRNA oligonucleotides (5-GATCCCCCTAAAACCAGGTATCAATTCAAGAGATTGATACCTGGTTTTAGGGAGA-3′ and 3′-GGGGATTTTGGTCCATAGTTAAGTTCTCTAACTATGGACCAAAATCCCTCTTCGA-5′) were annealed, ligated into pSilencer neovector (Ambion), and transformed into competent Escherichia coli to screen for positive hairpin siRNA inserts. The accuracy of the knockdown was determined by Western blotting. For generation of stable cell lines, COS-1 and MA-10 cells were independently transfected with the purified plasmid using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, single clones were generated by limiting dilution into a selection medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, GE Healthcare). Individual clones were then transferred to 24-well plates (Greiner, Germany) for propagation and then later transferred to 6-cm plates for transfection with StAR and F2. Individual clones were examined for VDAC1 expression by Western blotting. For knockdown of PCP, 20 pmol of PCP siRNA (GGUUAUGCCAACACUUUGATT) was transfected, as described for VDAC1 siRNA. Expression of PCP was examined 48 h after transfection. Western blotting was performed with 12.5 μgof protein and PCP-specific antibody (1:200) dilution. Signals were developed with West-Pico chemilumiscent reagent (Pierce). In Vitro Transcription/Translation, Mitochondrial Import, and Protein Complex Isolation—In vitro translation was performed in the TnT rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega). Translation of cDNA was carried out in the presence of [35S]methionine or unlabeled methionine with SP6 polymerase at 30 °C for 90 min, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ribosomes and ribosome-bound nascent polypeptide chains were removed by ultracentrifugation at 148,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Translated proteins were allowed to undergo brief import by incubation with sheep adrenal mitochondria (100 μg of protein) at 26 °C for 10 min. For import and blocking experiments, mitochondrial import of [35S]StAR (2 μl) was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 26 °C (3Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Partial proteolysis was carried out with 10 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at 4 °C. Reactions were terminated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and heat inactivation. For analysis of the assembled proteins in the complex, mitochondria were re-isolated and lysed in digitonin buffer ((1% (w/v) digitonin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice (18Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The digitonin lysate was combined with native-PAGE sample buffer (5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 100 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid) and subjected to 3–16% gradient native-PAGE at 100 V overnight at 4 °C. Protein complexes were further fractionated by applying 100 μl of digitonin lysate to a 30-10% sucrose density step gradient, with a 200-μl 66% sucrose cushion at the bottom (final volume = 2.0 ml). Following centrifugation at 55,000 × g in a Beckman TLA55 rotor for 4 h, the sample was immediately equally aliquoted and loaded onto gradient, native-PAGE (20 μl) or SDS-PAGE gels (20 μl). Radiolabeled proteins were detected by digital autoradiography or on a phosphorimager. Pulse-Chase Labeling Experiments—COS-1 cells transfected with StAR or N-62 StAR were incubated with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 30 min, then labeled with 0.1 mCi of [35S]methionine for 30 min. After labeling, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 mm methionine and chased for the times indicated. Cells were than scraped into immunoprecipitation buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysed cells were aliquoted in smaller fractions and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, as described above. Measurement of ATP—COS-1 or MA-10 cells were serum starved for 24 h and then stimulated with 100 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 20 μm rotenone. Media were collected for radioimmunoassay, and cell lysates were analyzed for StAR and phosphoserine-StAR by Western blot. Cellular ATP content was determined using a kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (ENLITEN ATP Assay system, Promega). Identification of VDAC1—StAR activity is maximal when it is affixed to the OMM (3Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), suggesting that StAR interacts with OMM proteins. [35S]StAR synthesized in a cell-free system was chemically cross-linked to OMM proteins on freshly prepared sheep adrenal mitochondria using disuccinimidyl suberate. This consistently generated a 75-kDa consistent complex (Fig. 1B). Other homobifunctional cross-linkers cross-linked a band of similar size (not shown). This 75-kDa band was specific as observed on titration with different concentrations of cross-linkers (data not shown). Mass spectrometry showed that the bands at about 50 and 60 kDa did not contain StAR, and that the dark band at 50 kDa was globulin. Considering the specificity of the cross-linking products, the 75-kDa band was excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. In 12 experiments, 5 peptides corresponding to VDAC1 were identified (Table 1); two of these, LTFDSSFSPNTGK (Fig. 1C) and VTQSNFAVGYK (not shown), were seen in 10 of 12 experiments. A model structure of VDAC1 (19Shimizu S. Matsuoka Y. Shinohara Y. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) indicates these two peptides are exposed to cytoplasm. Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked proteins with StAR and VDAC1 antibodies also yielded a 75-kDa band, whereas immunoprecipitation with antisera to Tom 40, PBR, or VDAC2 did not, demonstrating the specificity of the StAR-VDAC1 interaction (Fig. 1D). The relatively minor band above the major 75-kDa band did not yield enough protein for mass spectrometric analysis, even when multiple gel fractions were pooled together.TABLE 1VDAC1 peptides identified by MS/MSPositionMrSequence53-60833.44VTGSLETK256-2651029.58LTLSALLDGK163-1731212.59VTQSNFAVGYKaFrequently associated with StAR.96-1081399.68LTFDSSFSPNTGKaFrequently associated with StAR.34-521958.82SENGLEFTSSGSANTETTKa Frequently associated with StAR. Open table in a new tab Role of VDAC1 in StAR Activity—To understand the significance of StAR-VDAC1 interactions, we used siRNA to knockdown VDAC1 in COS-1 cells co-transfected with expression vectors for StAR and the F2 fusion protein of the cholesterol side chain cleavage system (H2N-P450scc-Ad-Red-Adx-COOH) (16Harikrishna J.A. Black S.M. Szklarz G.D. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), or for F2 and StAR lacking 62 N-terminal residues (N-62 StAR), which is as active as full-length StAR but is not imported into mitochondria (3Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Knockdown of VDAC1 inhibited pregnenolone synthesis, but synthesis could be restored by co-transfecting a VDAC-1 expression plasmid in which two nucleotides within the siRNA region were mutated. As an alternative to siRNA-mediated VDAC1 knockdown, cells were treated with KPA, a selective inhibitor of VDAC1 (20Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar), reducing activity by 74% (Fig. 1F). VDAC1 is associated with adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) on the IMM (21McEnery M.W. Snowman A.M. Trifiletti R.R. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3170-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Bongkrekic acid blocks the transfer of phosphate across the IMM and atractyloside inhibits transport of phosphate from the OMM to IMM by blocking ANT (22Stonner C.D. Sirak H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 56: 65-73Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Blocking of ANT with bongkrekic acid or atractyloside in COS-1 cells cotransfected with StAR and F2 showed no effect on pregnenolone synthesis (Fig. 1G). Water-soluble 22(R)-OH cholesterol, which bypasses the action of StAR, retained equivalent activity in all conditions, indicating that absence of VDAC1 did not affect P450scc. Similarly, when StAR was incubated with steroidogenic mitochondria, no pregnenolone was synthesized in the presence of KPA (Fig. 1H), but ANT blockers had no effect (not shown). Re-isolation of the KPA-treated mitochondria and reincubation with StAR restored pregnenolone synthesis, showing that temporary blocking of VDAC1 prevented cholesterol delivery. These results provide evidence that StAR-VDAC1 interactions are required for mitochondrial cholesterol import. Western blotting showed that VDAC1 knockdown in StAR-transfected cells reduced expression of the 37-kDa precursor, 32-kDa intermediate, and 30-kDa mature forms of StAR, respectively, and that there is no expression of phosphorylated StAR (Fig. 2A). Western blotting of COS-1 cells co-transfected with F2, N-62 StAR, and a VDAC1 knockdown vector showed reduced expression of phospho-StAR, but the expression of nonphosphorylated N-62 StAR remained unaltered (Fig. 2B). This effect is specific to StAR, as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial COX-IV remained unchanged in VDAC1 knockdown cells (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, blocking VDAC1 after preincubating the cells with two different concentrations of KPA suppressed the processing of phosphorylated 32-kDa StAR to 30-kDa StAR in transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 2C). Pulse-chase experiments of StAR-transfected COS-1 cells showed no processing of 32 to 30-kDa phospho-StAR in the presence of KPA, but processing of non-phosphorylated StAR was not altered (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that processing from 32 to 30 kDa phospho-StAR requires VDAC1. We next addressed how VDAC1 influences StAR phosphorylation and activity. The import kinetics of [35S]StAR with mitochondria from normal or VDAC-1 knockdown COS-1 cells were almost identical (Fig. 2E). Cell-free synthesized StAR is phosphorylated (23Lingappa V.L. Lingappa J.R. Mount Sinai J. Med. 2005; 72: 141-160PubMed Google Scholar) and VDAC1 is necessary for the processing of StAR, thus the import of [35S]StAR remained unchanged in VDAC1 knockdown cells. In the absence of VDAC1, StAR might be misfolded, rendering it susceptible to proteolytic degradation. To test this hypothesis, VDAC1 knockdown cells were incubated with MG132, lactacystin, and E64; MG132 and lactacystin are proteasomal inhibitors (24Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), whereas E64 is an inhibitor of cysteine proteases but not proteasomes (25Masacardo R.N. Eilon G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 244: 361-367PubMed Google Scholar). Pregnenolone synthesis was marginally increased with MG132 (Fig. 2F), but lactacystin had no effect on StAR activity or expression (Fig. 2G). Surprisingly, pregnenolone synthesis was restored to 100% with E64 (Fig. 2F), accompanied by"

The extracellular domain (M2e) has remained nearly invariable since the first human influenza strain was isolated in 1933. By linking a modified form of the leucine zipper of the yeast transcription factor GCN4 to M2e, we obtained a recombinant tetrameric protein, M2e-tGCN4. This protein mimics the quaternary structure of the ectodomain of the natural M2 protein. M2e-tGCN4 was purified, biochemically characterized, and used to immunize BALB/c mice. High M2e-specific serum IgG antibody titers were obtained following either intraperitoneal or intranasal administration. Immunized mice were protected fully against a potentially lethal influenza A virus challenge. Antibodies raised by M2e-tGCN4 immunization specifically bound to the surface of influenza-infected cells and to an M2-expressing cell line. Using a M2e peptide competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with M2-expressing cells as target, we obtained evidence that M2e-tGCN4 induces antibodies that are specific for the native tetrameric M2 ectodomain.

Influenza has one of the highest infection rates of all human viruses and can kill healthy persons of all ages (1Cox N.J. Subbarao K. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1277-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). It is estimated that influenza infection during seasonal epidemics kills 1 in 1000 infected individuals, whereas an unpredictable pandemic is likely to kill millions. In addition, increased hospitalization and absenteeism from school and work are direct consequences of the flu. At present, the best way to protect against influenza is to vaccinate against the ever-mutating strains (2Nichol K.L. Treanor J.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2006; 194: S111-S118Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, antigenic drift and occasional shift of the two major membrane glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, make vaccine production cumbersome and necessitate yearly revision of the vaccine seed strains by the World Health Organization.Influenza A also encodes a third integral membrane protein, M2, 2The abbreviations used are: M2, matrix protein 2; M2e, extracellular domain of M2; BM2e, influenza B M2 protein ectodomain; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; HBc, hepatitis B virus core; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Bistris propane, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane. 2The abbreviations used are: M2, matrix protein 2; M2e, extracellular domain of M2; BM2e, influenza B M2 protein ectodomain; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; HBc, hepatitis B virus core; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Bistris propane, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane. a homotetramer, the subunit of which has a small external domain (M2e) of 23 amino acid residues (3Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8997-9000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Natural M2 protein is present in a few copies in the virus particle but in abundance on virus-infected cells (4Zebedee S.L. Richardson C.D. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 502-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, M2e is almost nonimmunogenic (5Feng J. Zhang M. Mozdzanowska K. Zharikova D. Hoff H. Wunner W. Couch R.B. Gerhard W. Virol. J. 2006; 3: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and its sequence is highly conserved. Capitalizing on these properties, we developed a universal influenza A vaccine by linking the M2e peptide to a virus-like particle based on the hepatitis B virus core (HBc) (6Neirynck S. Deroo T. Saelens X. Vanlandschoot P. Min Jou W. Fiers W. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In this context, M2e is highly immunogenic, and the M2e-HBc vaccine induces antibodies that protect mice against influenza-induced death and morbidity.Oligomeric proteins found in vaccines derived by inactivating or attenuating a pathogen often function as their major antigenic determinant. Conformational epitopes embedded in the quaternary structures may critically contribute to immunogenicity, but the oligomeric status of the antigenic structures may change during vaccine preparation, leading to aggregation or disassembly into monomers. For example, when producing influenza split vaccines, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase oligomeric antigens may lose their oligomeric structure during the virus disruption step, or they may form aggregates. Specific protein oligomerization is critical for the function of many proteins. For example, influenza virus hemagglutinin is a homotrimer (7Wiley D.C. Skehel J.J. Waterfield M. Virology. 1977; 79: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and neuraminidase is a homotetramer composed of two disulfide-linked dimers (8Laver W.G. Valentine R.C. Virology. 1969; 38: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9Bucher D.J. Kilbourne E.D. J. Virol. 1972; 10: 60-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Varghese J.N. Laver W.G. Colman P.M. Nature. 1983; 303: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 11Ward C.W. Colman P.M. Laver W.G. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the enzymatic activity of neuraminidase is associated only with the tetrameric form (12Deroo T. Min Jou W. Fiers W. Vaccine. 1996; 14: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tetrameric neuraminidase molecules are considerably more immunogenic than the monomers and dimers. The quaternary structure of an oligomeric protein is often determined by a subdomain with strong oligomerization properties. In many instances, an oligomerization subdomain can be substituted by a heterologous motif with similar conformation-inducing properties. For example, the p53 tetramerization domain can be replaced with a tetrameric coiled-coil motif, in this case an engineered leucine zipper that assembles as a four-stranded coiled-coil, with regain of full function (13Waterman M.J. Waterman J.L. Halazonetis T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 22: 3113-3118Google Scholar).Influenza M2e is the entry site of the proton channel. To obtain a tetrameric structure with the conformation of the native M2 ectodomain, we fused M2e to a sequence variant of the leucine zipper domain from the yeast transcription factor GCN4, forming all parallel four-chain coiled-coils (15Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The fusion protein, M2e-tGCN4, was evaluated as a vaccine antigen both biochemically and biologically. M2e-tGCN4 is a potent vaccine that induces in mice complete protective immunity against a lethal challenge with influenza virus. Finally, by using a competitive ELISA, we provide evidence that this vaccine elicits antibodies that bind specifically to conformational epitopes on the ectodomain of natural M2 protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of M2e-tGCN4 and BM2e-tGCN4—Two overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) were used to generate the coding sequence for a modified version of the leucine zipper domain GCN4. This variant (tGCN4) forms four-stranded parallel coiled-coils (15Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). We used standard PCR protocols to fuse M2e or the influenza B M2 ectodomain (BM2e) at the N terminus of tGCN4 and cloned the fusions in the bacterial expression vector pLT32H under control of the left promoter of phage lambda (16Mertens N. Remaut E. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 3N. Mertens, unpublished data. The sequences of the primers used are available upon request. The resulting expression constructs, pLT32hM2etGCN4 and pLT32hBM2etGCN4, were sequence verified and used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 RIL (Invitrogen) containing the transcription regulatory plasmid pICA2. 3N. Mertens, unpublished data. The deduced amino acid sequences of M2e- and BM2e-tGCN4 are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. M2e- and BM2e-tGCN4 proteins were expressed and purified in the same way. A 30-ml preculture grown at 28 °C in Luria broth was used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh medium. At an A600 of 0.6–0.8, the cells were treated with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, incubated for another 4 h, and then collected by centrifugation (6000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Bistris propane buffer, pH 6.8, and sonicated. Bacterial debris was pelleted by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The supernatant was applied to a DEAE column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Bistris propane, pH 6.8 (buffer A). M2e- and BM2e-tGCN4 were eluted by a two-step gradient going from 0–40% buffer B (20 mm Bistris propane, pH 6.8, 1 m NaCl) and 40–100% buffer B. Fractions containing M2e- or BM2e-tGCN4 were pooled, adjusted to 25% ammonium sulfate saturation, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with 25% ammonium sulfate, 50 mm Tris, pH 8 (buffer C). Bound proteins were eluted with a two-step gradient. The two-step elution was performed with 0–40 and 40–100% 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8 (buffer D). The fractions containing M2e- or BM2e-tGCN4 were concentrated by ultrafiltration (10-kDa cut-off) and loaded on a Superdex 75 column. Gel filtration was performed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the fractions containing M2e- or BM2e-tGCN4 were pooled and stored at -70 °C.Estimation of Molecular Weight by Nondenaturing PAGE—The molecular weights of the M2e- and BM2e-tGCN4 proteins were estimated using a modification of the methods of Bryan (17Bryan J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and Davis (18Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15920) Google Scholar). Briefly, the chimeric protein and molecular weight standards were resolved by gel electrophoresis using various polyacrylamide concentrations. Electrophoretic mobility (RF) was determined in each gel relative to the tracking dye, and 100 log (RF × 100) values were plotted against the percent gel concentration for the reference proteins as well as M2e- and BM2e-tGCN4. The slope for each protein was determined and the logarithm of the negative slope was plotted against the logarithm of the molecular weight of each standard protein. This produces a linear plot from which the molecular weight of an unknown protein can be deduced.Cross-linking of M2e-tGCN4—Cross-linking was carried out in PBS, pH 8.0. Freshly made 65 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3; Pierce) was added to 20 μg of purified M2e-tGCN4 to final concentrations of 10 to 0.1 mm in a final volume of 24 μl. The reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, quenched by adding Tris buffer, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 50 mm, and incubated for 15 min. The cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Pierce) was used similarly, but a 25 mm stock solution in Me2SO was used. After cross-linking, an equal volume of reducing (200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.8) or nonreducing (20% glycerol, 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.8) loading buffer was added. The samples were boiled and then resolved by SDS-PAGE with a prestained broad range molecular weight marker as reference (Bio-Rad).Mass Spectrometric Analysis of M2e-tGCN4—We used mass spectrometry to analyze M2e-tGCN4 alone and cross-linked by either BS3 or DSP. A 1-μl sample containing 0.3 μg of protein was mixed with 1 μl of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid that had been diluted 5-fold, and 0.5 μl of this mixture was dried on the MALDI target of an Ultraflex mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Before measurement, the target was briefly rinsed with 10 mm ammonium citrate. MALDI mass spectra were generated by accumulation of 200 laser shots on the best target spots.Generation of M2-expressing HEK Cells and HEK-M2 ELISA—M2 cDNA was cloned in the pENTR3C vector (Invitrogen) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and recombined into pDWPI using the Gateway® system. Recombinant lentivirus was produced by cotransfection of HEK293T cells with the pDWPI-M2 expression plasmid and the packaging plasmids pMGD and pδR (19Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gorge F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (3979) Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant lentivirus was used to transduce HEK293 cells. Green fluorescent protein-positive cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, which generated HEK-M2 cells. These were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10 μm amantadine. For ELISA, HEK-M2 cells were seeded at 15,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate. After 24 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were fixed with 100 μl of 0.05% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The plates were washed and incubated for 90 min with the indicated immune serum samples or with M2e-specific monoclonal 14C2 (Affinity BioReagents) diluted in PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin. Washing of the plates was followed by incubation with a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG; detection was with tetramethylbenzidine substrate. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 1 m H2SO4. For competition assays, immune serum was preincubated for 1 h with serial dilutions of the M2e peptide or M2e- or BM2e-tGCN4 before transfer to the HEK-M2 plates.Immunization and Challenge of Mice—Specific pathogen-free female BALB/c mice were obtained from Harlan and housed in a temperature-controlled environment with 12-h light/dark cycles and given free access to food and water. At the age of 8 weeks they were injected intraperitoneally with 10 μg of M2e- or BM2e-tGCN4 with trehalose dicorynomycolate + monophosphoryl lipid A (Sigma) or Alhydrogel (Brenntag Biosector A/S) adjuvant or intranasally with the mucosal adjuvant CTA1-DD and boosted twice at 3-week intervals, as described previously (6Neirynck S.

Vaccine. 2006; 24: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Two weeks after each immunization, blood samples were collected from the ventral tail vein. The final bleeding was performed by cardiac puncture. Blood was left to clot at 37 °C for 30 min, and serum was collected by taking the supernatant from two consecutive centrifugations. The titers of IgG subtypes produced against the M2e peptide, M2e-tGCN4, and BM2e-tGCN4 were determined by ELISA (20De Filette M. Min Jou W. Birkett A. Lyons K. Schultz B. Tonkyro A. Rench S. Fiers W. Virology. 2005; 337: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mice were challenged under light isoflurane anesthesia with 4 LD50 mouse-adapted X47 for the follow-up study. X47 is a H3N2 recombinant influenza A virus strain (A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) × A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)). X47 was adapted to mice by several lung passages as described (6Neirynck S. Deroo T. Saelens X. Vanlandschoot P. Min Jou W. Fiers W. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were authorized by the Institutional Ethics Committee on Experimental Animals and conducted under conditions specified by law (European Directive and Belgian Royal Decree of November 14, 1993).RESULTSPurification and Characterization of M2e-tGCN4—We constructed a bacterial expression vector to produce M2e fused at its C terminus to the GCN4-derived tetramerizing leucine zipper (supplemental Fig. S1A). As a control we used BM2e, the biological counter-part of influenza A M2e (14Mould J.A. Paterson R.G. Takeda M. Ohigashi Y. Venkataraman P. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recombinant M2e-tGCN4 was purified to ∼98% (supplemental Fig. S1B, lane 5). BM2e-tGCN4 was purified according to the same protocol (supplemental Fig. S2A). Under reducing SDS-PAGE conditions, M2e-tGCN4 migrated as a predominant band with apparent molecular mass of 7 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 2). However, under nonreducing conditions, M2e-tGCN4 appeared as a band of 26 kDa corresponding to a tetramer and a minor band of ∼13 kDa corresponding to a dimer (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Because M2 is a tetrameric protein with subunits linked by disulfide bridges in the M2e domain, we speculated that these intermolecular bonds were also present in M2e-tGCN4. In the size exclusion step on a Superdex 75 column, fractions containing M2e-tGCN4 appeared as two peaks with approximate molecular masses of 47 kDa (peak MG1) and 35 kDa (peak MG2) (Fig. 1A). The former peak corresponded to M2e-tGCN4 associated with bacterial protein contaminants and was discarded (data not shown). The calculated molecular mass of purified M2e-tGCN4 is 25.8 kDa, but it was estimated by nondenaturing PAGE at 33 kDa (supplemental Fig. S2). These experimentally derived values suggest that M2e-tGCN4 and BM2e-tGCN4 have tetrameric structures.To prove that M2e-tGCN4 is indeed a tetramer, chemical cross-linking experiments were performed with the homobifunctional cross-linkers BS3 and DSP. Following cross-linking, nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a major band with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 5). When decreasing amounts of cross-linker were used, a band of 26 kDa reappeared (supplemental Fig. S3).Mass spectrometric analysis of M2e-tGCN4 allowed unambiguous determination of the oligomerization state. The MALDI spectrum of nontreated M2e-tGCN4 revealed two components with estimated masses of 6320 ± 13 and 12,664 ± 25 Da. These values correspond with the monomeric and dimeric forms of M2e-GCN4 lacking the initiator methionine (Fig. 1D). When samples cross-linked by BS3 or DSP were analyzed, we noticed broader peaks centered at molecular masses 26,533 ± 53 and 27,068 ± 54 Da, respectively, together with residual monomer and dimer. Peak broadening is most likely due to different numbers of cross-linker molecules attached to the M2e-tGCN4 protein. The second, less intense peaks had masses of ∼13,800 (BS3) and 14,000 (DSP) Da and presumably correspond to double-charged cross-linked tetramers or dimers (Fig. 1, E and F). Taken together, we conclude that M2e-tGCN4 is a soluble, tetrameric protein consisting of disulfide-linked dimers, and a fraction is even further stabilized by disulfide cross-links between the dimers.M2e-tGCN4 Immunization Protects Mice from Challenge with Influenza A Virus—We next determined whether immunization with M2e-tGCN4 could induce a protective immune response. BALB/c mice were immunized three times with M2e-tGCN4 together with alum, Ribi, or CTA1-DD adjuvants as described previously for the M2e-HBc vaccine (6Neirynck S. Deroo T. Saelens X. Vanlandschoot P. Min Jou W. Fiers W. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 20De Filette M. Min Jou W. Birkett A. Lyons K. Schultz B. Tonkyro A. Rench S. Fiers W.

Vaccine. 2006; 24: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). BM2e-tGCN4 was used as a control. M2e-specific serum IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were induced in all M2e-tGCN4-treated groups, as quantified by the M2e peptide ELISA (Fig. 2, A and B). A strong antibody response against the GCN4 moiety was also apparent from ELISA using BM2e-tGCN4-coated plates. Importantly, M2e-tGCN4-immunized mice were protected against a potentially lethal challenge with 4 LD50 of mouse adapted X47 virus (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2A–C, immunization with M2e-tGCN4. Five groups of 11 BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 μg of M2e-tGCN4 vaccine or PBS in the presence of Ribi adjuvant (intraperitoneal), Alhydrogel (Alh; intraperitoneal), or CTA1-DD (intranasal) as indicated. Three weeks after the boost, mice were challenged with 4 LD50 mouse-adapted X47 virus. A and B, IgG1 and IgG2a titers, respectively, of mice after the second boost. ELISA plates were coated with the M2e peptide, M2e-tGCN4, or BM2e-tGCN4 as indicated. C, mortality after challenge. D, M2e-tGCN4 immune serum specifically binds to native M2. Indirect immunofluorescent detection of the M2 ectodomain on the surface of infected MDCK cells is shown. MDCK cells were infected with influenza A strain X47, and 24 h later they were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were stained with serum from PBS-treated mice (upper left panel), M2e-tGCN4 immune serum (upper right panel), or BM2e-tGCN4 immune serum (lower panel) followed by staining with goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor 594. E–G, competition of antibody binding to HEK-M2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of BM2e-tGCN4 (E), M2e-tGCN4 (F), or the M2e peptide (G). All plates contained HEK-M2 cell monolayers as target and were treated with either 100 ng/ml monoclonal antibody 14C2 or 1:5000 dilution of M2e-tGCN4 immune serum. These dilutions of 14C2 and M2e-tGCN4 immune serum have the same reactivity against HEK-M2 cells in ELISA. Decreasing concentrations of competitor were used to assess inhibition of binding expressed as percentage relative to binding in the absence of competitor. The results were obtained from experiments performed in quadruplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)M2e-tGCN4-specific Antibodies Recognize Native Tetrameric M2—Because M2e is presented as a tetrameric complex by M2e-tGCN4, we investigated whether antibodies raised by immunization could bind to M2e tetramer-specific conformational epitopes. Immunofluorescence staining of X47-infected MDCK cells with M2e-tGCN4 immune serum demonstrated specific staining of M2 present on the cell surface (Fig. 2D, upper right panel). BM2e-tGCN4 control immune serum did not bind to infected MDCK cells (Fig. 2D). We used a lentiviral vector system to generate HEK-M2 cells that constitutively express M2 (supplemental Fig. S4A) and can be kept in culture for a long time, provided amantadine, an M2 proton channel inhibitor, is present in the medium. As in the case of infected cells, M2e-tGCN4, but not BM2e-tGCN4, immune serum specifically bound nonpermeabilized HEK-M2 cells (supplemental Fig. S4, B and C).To provide direct evidence for the presence of M2e tetramer-specific antibodies, we used an HEK-M2 cell-based ELISA to analyze binding of anti-M2e-tGCN4 serum in the absence or presence of different concentrations of competing M2e peptide or M2e-tGCN4 using both competitors in the same M2e molar range. Binding of mouse immune serum was almost completely inhibited by M2e-tGCN4, whereas free M2e peptide only partially inhibited the binding to HEK-M2 cells. In contrast, both inhibitors completely blocked the binding of the monoclonal antibody 14C2 to HEK-M2 cells (Fig. 2, F and G). As expected, BM2e-tGCN4 did not interfere with the binding of 14C2 or anti-M2e-tGCN4 immune serum (Fig. 2E). This indicates that serum IgG antibodies induced by immunization with M2e-tGCN4 recognize epitopes in the ectodomain of native M2 that are absent in the linear M2e peptide.DISCUSSIONThe purpose of our study was to obtain a well defined antigenic structure suitable for influenza vaccination and closely mimicking the native conformation of the tetrameric external domain of the influenza A M2 protein. In the native configuration, interactions in the intramembrane domain, and possibly even in the intracellular domain of M2 protein, contribute to the tetrameric assembly. To obtain a fully characterized molecular structure, we replaced the transmembrane segment by a defined, tetrameric scaffold. The resultant M2e-tGCN4 was expressed efficiently in bacteria as a soluble protein and was purified and characterized in detail.The status of the native form as a tetramer was proven by gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and cross-linking experiments in combination with mass spectrometry. The difference between the theoretically calculated molecular mass and the value estimated by gel filtration or native gel analysis can be explained by the fact that the GCN4-derived tetramerizing leucine zipper adopts a cylindrical shape (15Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Reduction with dithiothreitol resulted in dissociation of the dimers into monomers, indicating that the monomers are linked by disulfide bonds involving at least one of the two cysteines of M2e. A fraction of the tetramers does not dissociate by ionic detergent treatment alone but does so under reducing conditions, indicating some disulfide cross-links between dimers as well. Hence, the structure of the M2e domain of M2e-tGCN4 is very similar to the structure of native M2 protein (23Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1991; 183: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 25Sugrue R.J. Hay A.J. Virology. 1991; 180: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).Mass spectrometry provided unambiguous molecular mass values. M2e-tGCN4 revealed two peaks in the MALDI mass spectrometry, one corresponding to the theoretical size of the monomer (6320 kDa) and the other corresponding to the size of a dimer (12,664 Da), both lacking the N-terminal methionine. Most likely the tetrameric structure was destroyed by the energy of the ionizing laser. Mass spectrometric analysis of M2e-tGCN4 cross-linked by BS3 or DSP revealed a major peak corresponding to a tetramer. The observed molecular mass was slightly larger than the calculated value, undoubtedly because of bound cross-linker.M2e-tGCN4 was designed not only to increase the valency of the target antigen but also to mimic the natural conformation of the tetrameric M2 protein ectodomain. Combining M2e-tGCN4 with Ribi or Alhydrogel as adjuvant led to high IgG1 titers (Fig. 2) comparable with those obtained with the M2e-HBc vaccine described previously (6Neirynck S. Deroo T. Saelens X.

Virology. 2005; 337: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The titers of M2e-specific serum IgG2a were highest in the group immunized intranasally with M2e-tGCN4 plus CTA1-DD, in agreement with our previous results using the same mucosal adjuvant (21De Filette M. Ramne A. Lycke N. Löwenadler B. Saelens X. Fiers W. Vaccine. 2006; 24: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Unlike for IgG1, the IgG2a titers were lower compared with the M2e-HBc vaccine. The induced immunity fully protected mice from a lethal challenge. The antibodies in the immune serum bound specifically to influenza A virus-infected MDCK cells and to M2-expressing HEK cells.The M2e-specific monoclonal antibody 14C2 binds to the M2e peptide and also inhibits viral replication in passively immunized mice (22Treanor J.T. Tierney E.L. Zebedee S.L. Lamb R.A. Murphy B.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1375-1377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we anticipated that the tetrameric M2e domain presented to the immune system by M2e-tGCN4 would mimic the native M2 structu"
https://openalex.org/W1974133434,"The Arabidopsis thaliana AtHMA1 protein is a member of the PIB-ATPase family, which is implicated in heavy metal transport. However, sequence analysis reveals that AtHMA1 possesses a predicted stalk segment present in SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase)-type pumps that is involved in inhibition by thapsigargin. To analyze the ion specificity of AtHMA1, we performed functional complementation assays using mutant yeast strains defective in Ca2+ homeostasis or heavy metal transport. The heterologous expression of AtHMA1 complemented the phenotype of both types of mutants and, interestingly, increased heavy metal tolerance of wild-type yeast. Biochemical analyses were performed to describe the activity of AtHMA1 in microsomal fractions isolated from complemented yeast. Zinc, copper, cadmium, and cobalt activate the ATPase activity of AtHMA1, which corroborates the results of metal tolerance assays. The outcome establishes the role of AtHMA1 in Cd2+ detoxification in yeast and suggests that this pump is able to transport other heavy metals ions. Further analyses were performed to typify the active Ca2+ transport mediated by AtHMA1. Ca2+ transport displayed high affinity with an apparent Km of 370 nm and a Vmax of 1.53 nmol mg–1 min–1. This activity was strongly inhibited by thapsigargin (IC50 = 16.74 nm), demonstrating the functionality of its SERCA-like stalk segment. In summary, these results demonstrate that AtHMA1 functions as a Ca2+/heavy metal pump. This protein is the first described plant P-type pump specifically inhibited by thapsigargin.

In summary, these results demonstrate that AtHMA1 functions as a Ca2+/heavy metal pump. This protein is the first described plant P-type pump specifically inhibited by thapsigargin. Plant Ca2+ and heavy metal-ATPases belong to the superfamily of P-ATPases (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 696-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Their common characteristic is the presence of a phosphorylated intermediary in the catalytic cycle. In Arabidopsis, the heavy metal-ATPases belong to the PIB subfamily and normally have eight predicted transmembrane domains, whereas the Ca2+-ATPases are part of the PIIA and PIIB subfamilies and have ten predicted transmembrane domains (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 696-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A common feature among the PIB-ATPases is the presence of a CPX motif, which is though to play a role in metal translocation, as well as putative metal-binding domains located at the amino or carboxyl terminus (3Colangelo E.P. Guerinot M.L. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PIIB ATPases have a calmodulin-binding domain that regulate their activity; however, the PIIA do not have this domain (4Geisler M. Axelsen K.B. Harper J.F. Palmgren M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 52-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The most important difference between the calcium and heavy metal-ATPases is their substrate specificity (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). However, in vitro metal transport studies performed with membrane fractions isolated from seedlings suggest that one or more members of the superfamily of P-ATPases are capable of transporting calcium and heavy metals. The studies showed competitive inhibition between active transport of heavy metals (such as copper and cadmium) and calcium. 2V. R. Ordenes, L. Norambuena, and A. Orellana, unpublished results.2V. R.

To date no one has described plant ion pumps that transport calcium and heavy metals in biochemical terms, nor have scientists described genes encoding for ion pumps inhibited by thapsigargin or plant mutants with thapsigargin-sensitive/tolerant phenotypes. Based on the results of biochemical assays suggesting the existence of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+/heavy metal-ATPase, we searched for potential candidate proteins in the Arabidopsis genome. This was made possible by the highly conserved “stalk segment” or S3 sequence adjacent to the third transmembrane segment of the SERCA pumps (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

This sequence was almost complete and was annotated as a stalk segment (using the topology prediction software ARAMEMNON) in the Arabidopsis heavy metal pump AtHMA1 (At4g37270). This pump belongs to the subclass of zinc/cobalt/cadmium/lead-ATPases and is the most divergent metal pump of the Arabidopsis PIB-ATPases (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 696-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 10Cobbett C.S. Hussain D.

It lacks an amino-terminal heavy metal-binding domain, such as GMXCXXC or GICC(T/S)SE, which is often found in other members of the group. It has an intramembranous SPC instead of the CP(C/H/S) motif located at the putative metal transporting site of PIB-ATPases (11Williams L. Mills R. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 1360-1385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 12Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The pump possesses other structural characteristics related to heavy metal binding and transport, such as a poly-H motif commonly found in zinc-binding proteins, several C and CC pairs, and a HP dipeptide (11Williams L. Mills R. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 1360-1385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 12Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Initial studies performed by Higuchi and Sonoike (13Higuchi M. Sonoike K. van der Est A. Bruce D. Photosynthesis: Fundamental Aspects to Global Perspectives. 2005: 716-718Google Scholar) show that an Arabidopsis disruption mutant of AtHMA1 is sensitive to high concentrations of zinc. Recently, it was demonstrated that AtHMA1 is localized in the chloroplast envelope, and Arabidopsis insertional mutants exhibit a lower chloroplast copper content and a diminution of the total chloroplast superoxide dismutase, activity suggesting a role for AtHMA1 in copper homeostasis (14Seigneurin-Berny D. Gravot A. Auroy P. Mazard C. Kraut A. Finazzi G. Grunwald D. Rappaport F. Vavasseur A. Joyard J. Richaud P. Rolland N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2882-2892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). At this point, two key questions about the functions and ion specificities of AtHMA1 must be addressed. (i) Can AtHMA1 transport Ca2+? (ii) In which heavy metal homeostatic mechanisms is AtHMA1 involved? We expressed AtHMA1 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in order to perform functional complementation assays. We demonstrated that AtHMA1 complements the mutant phenotype displayed by two Ca2+ transport-deficient yeast strains. In vitro calcium transport assays showed that AtHMA1 promotes thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ transport. AtHMA1 also complements a Cd2+-hypersensitive yeast mutant and confers high Cd2+ tolerance onto wild-type yeast. Cadmium-stimulated ATPase activity of AtHMA1 confirms that this pump plays a role in cadmium transport. Expression of AtHMA1 also confers high zinc, copper, and cobalt tolerance onto yeast, and ATPase activity is also stimulated by the addition of these metals. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that AtHMA1 is a metal pump capable of transporting a wide range of ions including calcium. As such, AtHMA1 may represent a key element in the mechanism used to overcome ion deficiency or toxicity in Arabidopsis thaliana. sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase reverse transcription carboxypeptidase Y 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid thapsigargin wild type. sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase reverse transcription carboxypeptidase Y 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid thapsigargin wild type. Cloning of AtHMA1—Full-length AtHMA1 cDNA (2460 bp) was supplied by RIKEN (15Seki M. Narusaka M. Kamiya A. Ishida J. Satou M. Sakurai T. Nakajima M. Enju A. Akiyama K. Oono Y. Muramatsu M.

It was amplified using Accu-Therm™ DNA polymerase (GeneCraft) and primers flanking the coding region designed from the genomic sequence At4g37270. Primer sequences were as follows: 5′-CGCTTGAGATCTAATTCGTCGACCATGGAA-3′ (sense, BglII restriction site underlined) and 5′-AGACAAGCGGCCGCAAGTTACCCCCTAATG-3′ (antisense, NotI restriction site underlined). After verification by sequencing, the amplification product was digested with BglII and NotI and ligated into BamHI/NotI-digested pGPD426, a uracil yeast (S. cerevisiae) expression vector (17Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar) to generate pGPD426-AtHMA1. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used to build and maintain plasmid stocks using standard molecular biology procedures (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The following S. cerevisiae strains were used in this study: YR98 (MATα, ade2 his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112 lys2-Δ201 ura3-52) and its isogenic mutant Δpmr1 (YR122) (pmr1-Δ1::Leu2); W303 (MATa, ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1) and its isogenic mutant K616 (pmr1::His3 cnb1::Leu2 pmc1::Trp1); and DTY165 (MATα, ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9) and its isogenic mutant Δycf1 (DTY167) (ycf1::HisG). All strains were propagated at 30 °C in rich YPD medium, except K616, which was grown in YPD medium (1% (w/v) bacto-yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bacto-peptone, and 2% (w/v) glucose) supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2 (19Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F. Sze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed using the LiAc method (20Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). After transformation, yeast cells were grown in a selective medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose) and supplemented with appropriate auxotrophic requirements. Uracil-based selection was used to screen for transformants. Expression of AtHMA1 in Yeast—AtHMA1 expression in transformed yeast was verified using RT-PCR. Transformed yeast was grown on a selective medium until an A600 of 0.6. Cells were then collected by centrifugation and used to isolate total RNA following the Chomczynski phenol-chloroform extraction method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The first strand of cDNA was prepared using a RevertAid™ first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Ferrmentas) with oligo(dT) and 1 μg of total RNA. After reverse transcription of mRNA to cDNA, a 565-bp fragment of the AtHMA1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-ATGATGTTAACTGGGGACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTAATGTGCAGAGCTTAAACTGTTGCTGCTGCTACT-3′ (antisense). Amplification of ACT1 cDNA was used as an internal control in all reactions (22Del Aguila E.M. Dutra M.B. Silva J.T. Paschoalin V.M.F. BMC Mol. Biol. 2005; 6: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Functional Complementation Assays—Functional complementation of Ca2+ transport-defective mutants K616 and Δpmr1 was carried out as described previously (19Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F. Sze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mutant and wild-type yeast strains transformed with pGPD426 or pGPD426-AtHMA1 were streaked onto growth plates lacking uracil and supplemented with 10 mm EGTA. Ca2+-depleted plates were then incubated for up to 3 days at 30 °C. For functional complementation of the cadmium-hypersensitive yeast mutant Δycf1, the complementation was carried out by streaking transformed yeast onto growth plates lacking uracil and supplemented with 70 μm CdCl2. High Cd2+ plates were incubated for up to 5 days at 30 °C. Metal Toxicity Tests—To test sensitivity to high cadmium concentrations in Δycf1 yeast transformed with AtHMA1, cells grown to log phase were diluted to an A600 of 0.1 and incubated in the presence of 70–200 μm CdCl2. Growth at 30 °C was monitored by the change in A600 every 3 h for 21 h, and the rate of exponential growth of yeast cultures was expressed as generation time in hours, i.e. the doubling time of each yeast population. Sensitivity to other transition metals was tested by growing transformed Δycf1 on solid media supplemented with 6 mm CoCl2, 4 mm CuSO4, or 28 mm ZnCl2. Plates were incubated for 5 days at 30 °C. Additionally, the capacity of AtHMA1 to confer cadmium tolerance to wild-type yeast (W303) was tested by growing transformed cells in liquid medium with 70–200 μm CdCl2, and the A600 of cultures was followed for 5 days. Carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) Detection Assay—Transformed K616 and wild-type cells were grown in 3 ml of selective medium for 2 days at 30 °C. To obtain yeast lysate samples, cells were resuspended in 200 μl of SUMEB buffer (1% SDS, 8 m urea, 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) plus 100 μl of 500-μm glass beads (Sigma) and then vortexed three times for 1 min. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 65 °C and centrifuged at 2,000 × g. The supernatant was collected. Two μl of supernatant (or yeast lysate) and 600 μl of growth media were transferred simultaneously onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a dot-blot device (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then washed briefly with water and blocked with 5% milk in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Secreted CPY was detected by monoclonal anti-CPY antibody (1:1,000) (Molecular Probes). Anti-mouse IgG antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1: 10,000; Molecular Probes) was used as secondary antibody. Isolation of Yeast Membranes—Membranes were prepared from yeast cells as described previously (23Liang F. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 2–5 ml of stationary phase cultures of transformed yeast was diluted into 300 ml of appropriate selective medium, grown for 24 h at 30 °C to an A600 of ∼0.8, and collected by centrifugation. After being washed with distilled water, the cells were resuspended in 1 volume of a buffer solution containing 10% sucrose, 25 mm Hepes-bis-Tris propane, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). One volume of 500-μm glass beads was added to the mixture, and yeast cells were disrupted by vortexing at maximum speed for 2 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of a buffer solution containing 10% sucrose, 20 mm Hepes-bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the mixture of protease inhibitors described above. The membrane preparations were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until needed. Protein content was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce Chemical) with bovine serum albumin as standard. ATPase Activity Assays—These assays were carried out as described previously (24Eren E. Argüello J.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Yeast vesicles (50 μg protein/ml) were mixed with a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 20 mm Cys, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and each metal (at 1 μm) listed in Fig. 6A. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Released inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically (25Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Bichem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Background activity measured in the absence of metals was less than 10% of the highest metal-stimulated activity and was subtracted from the activity determined in the presence of metals. The results are the average of four independent experiments with measurements performed in triplicate. The relative activity was standardized by setting the highest value obtained from the measurements (48.15 nmol μg–1) at 100% relative activity. All subsequent values were then adjusted accordingly and the S.E. was calculated. 45Ca2+ Uptake Assays—Ca2+ uptake by membranes of transformed yeast was assayed measuring 45Ca2+ accumulation using the filtration method (26Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Membrane samples were suspended (0.3–0.6 mg protein/ml final concentration) in a reaction buffer (3 ml) containing 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm Hepes-bis-Tris propane (pH 7.0), 10 mm KCl, and 0.4 mm NaN3. Free Ca2+ concentration in the reaction buffer was set at desired values using variable amounts of 45CaCl2 (containing 2.4 Ci of 45Ca2+ mmol–1 CaCl2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and EGTA. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the WinMaxC 2.05 computer program. Vesicles were incubated in the buffer at 25 °C for 1 min, and transport was initiated (time zero) by adding a mixture of ATP and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 2 and 3 mm, respectively. Samples of 200 μl were taken at different times and filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filters were rinsed immediately with 5 ml of ice-cold STOP buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm Hepes-bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0, and 0.2 mm CaCl2. The 45Ca2+ radioactivity associated with the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Ca2+ uptake was expressed as nmol Ca2+/mg protein in the presence and absence of ATP-Mg. To determine the Km for Ca2+ uptake activity, the reaction mixture contained 500 μm EGTA and various amounts of Ca2+ To provide the desired range of free Ca2+ concentration (from pCa 5.5–7.2). ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake (nmol mg–1 min–1) was defined as the difference between the 45Ca2+ retained in the filters following incubation in the presence and absence of MgATP. The effect of thapsigargin (TG) was tested by adding the compound to a final concentration in the reaction mixture of 0.1 μm at 15 min before the uptake assay was started. 45Ca2+ uptake and ATPase activity assays were performed at least four times in triplicate. Growth Inhibition of Δpmr1 and K616 on Ca2+-deficient Media Is Overcome by the Expression of AtHMA1—Fig. 1 shows a comparison between AtHMA1 and SERCA1. Like all P-type ATPases, both enzymes are transmembrane proteins. SERCA1 possesses ten transmembrane helices, like the vast majority of characterized Ca2+-ATPases. AtHMA1, instead, has seven predicted transmembrane helices (according to the topology prediction software ARAMEMNON). This differs from the characteristic eight predicted transmembrane helices presented in the rest of plant metal-ATPases recruited in the PIB-ATPase subfamily (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 696-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AtHMA1 and SERCA1 share the highly conserved Asp in the signature sequence DKTGT that is phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle of P-type ATPases (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J.

Other common features of P-type ATPases are slightly modified in AtHMA1. For example, the transduction domain TGES (29Andersen J.P. Vilsen B.

It is noteworthy that AtHMA1, as a heavy metal pump, possesses the signature sequence DEFGENYSK (black circles), which is very similar to the DEFGEQLSK sequence involved in the inhibitory effect of thapsigargin in SERCA-type Ca2+ pumps (6Zhong L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12994-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 38Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether AtHMA1 plays a role in Ca2+ homeostasis, we performed functional complementation assays using mutant yeast deficient in Ca2+ transport. Heterologous expression of the complete AtHMA1 cDNA was performed under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GPD) promoter (39Bitter G.A. Egan K.M. Gene. 1984; 32: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and was verified using RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that parental wild-type yeast strains YR98 and W303 grew normally on media containing 10 mm EGTA. As demonstrated previously (26Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), Δpmr1, a strain in which the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase PMR1 is disrupted (40Antebi A. Fink G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), was unable to grow in media depleted of Ca2+ in cells transformed with the empty vector. When this mutant was transformed with pGPD426-AtHMA1, growth on Ca2+-deficient medium was restored. AtHMA1 expression also complemented the Ca2+ depletion sensitivity of the triple mutant K616, which lacks both endogenous Ca2+ pumps (PMR1 and PMC1) and calcineurin (CNB1) function (19Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F. Sze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J.

Similar to Δpmr1, K616 transformed with the empty vector did not grow on a medium containing very low Ca2+ (10 mm EGTA). Nevertheless, the triple mutant transformed with pGPD426-AtHMA1 became tolerant of this condition (Fig. 2B), supporting the hypothesis that AtHMA1 encodes a functional Ca2+ pump. AtHMA1 Reverts the Missorting Phenotype Displayed by K616—Given that yeast mutants lacking the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase PMR1 partially secrete carboxypeptidase Y, an enzyme normally destined to the vacuole (40Antebi A. Fink G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of AtHMA1 expression on this characteristic phenotype. CPY secreted due to missorting was detected using a monoclonal anti-CPY antibody. CPY was detected in a culture media sample recovered from K616 cells transformed with the empty vector as shown in Fig. 2C. However, CPY was not detected in the culture media of K616 cells transformed with pGPD426-AtHMA1. In both cases, intracellular accumulation of CPY was verified in cell lysates. The wild-type strain was used as a negative control, as CPY is not secreted under normal conditions (26Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2082866035,"In wound healing, myofibroblast transdifferentiation (MFT) is a metaplastic change in phenotype producing profibrotic effector cells that secrete and remodel the extracellular matrix. Unlike pathways that induce MFT, the molecular mechanisms that negatively regulate MFT are poorly understood. Here, we report that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) blocks MFT in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ). Pharmacological activation of AMPK inhibited TGFβ-induced secretion of extracellular matrix proteins collagen types I and IV and fibronectin. AMPK activation also prevented induction of the myofibroblast phenotype markers α-smooth muscle actin and the ED-A fibronectin splice variant. AMPK activators did not prevent MFT in cells transduced with an adenovirus expressing dominant negative, kinase-dead AMPKα2. Moreover, AMPK activators did not inhibit MFT induction in AMPKα1,2–/– fibroblasts, demonstrating a requirement for AMPKα expression. Adenoviral transduction of constitutively active AMPKα2 was sufficient to prevent TGFβ-induced collagen I, α-smooth muscle actin, and ED-A fibronectin. AMPK did not reduce TGFβ-stimulated Smad3 COOH-terminal phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, which are necessary for MFT. However, AMPK activation inhibited TGFβ-induced transcription driven by Smad3-binding cis-elements. Consistent with a role for AMPK in transcriptional regulation, nuclear translocation of AMPKα2 correlated with the appearance of active AMPKα in the nucleus. Collectively, these results demonstrate that AMPK inhibits TGFβ-induced transcription downstream of Smad3 COOH-terminal phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, activation of AMPK is sufficient to negatively regulate MFT in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2035881613,"The aim of this study was to investigate changes in protein profiles during the early phase of dopaminergic neuronal death using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in conjunction with mass spectrometry. Several protein spots were identified whose expression was significantly altered following treatment of MN9D dopaminergic neuronal cells with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). In particular, we detected oxidative modification of thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases (peroxiredoxins; PRX) in treated MN9D cells. Oxidative modification of PRX induced by 6-OHDA was blocked in the presence of N-acetylcysteine, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by 6-OHDA induce oxidation of PRX. These findings were confirmed in primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons and in rat brain injected stereotaxically. Overexpression of PRX1 in MN9D cells (MN9D/PRX1) exerted neuroprotective effects against death induced by 6-OHDA through scavenging of ROS. Consequently, generation of both superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide following 6-OHDA treatment was decreased in MN9D/PRX1. Furthermore, overexpression of PRX1 protected cells against 6-OHDA-induced activation of p38 MAPK and subsequent activation of caspase-3. In contrast, 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic death signals were enhanced by RNA interference-targeted reduction of PRX1 in MN9D cells. Taken together, our data suggest that the redox state of PRX may be intimately involved in 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuronal cell death and also provide a molecular mechanism by which PRX1 exerts a protective role in experimental models of Parkinson disease.

Przedborski S. Neuron. 2003; 39: 889-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4149) Google Scholar). Clinical manifestations, such as resting tremor, slowness of movement, stiffness, and postural instability in patients with PD are consequences of the loss of DA neurons and the resulting depletion of dopamine in the striatum. Most PD cases are sporadic, and its etiology is incompletely understood; however, an increasing body of evidence suggests that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD (2Fahn S. Cohen G. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 3Leroy E. Boyer R. Auburger G. Leube B. Ulm G. Mezey E. Harta G. Brownstein M.J. Jonnalagada S. Chernova T.

DA neurons are vulnerable to neurodegeneration because of their high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (7Graham D.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 633-643PubMed Google Scholar); enzymatic metabolism of dopamine produces hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals, and intracellular autoxidation of dopamine induces the formation of dopamine-quinone, leading to the generation of hydroxyl radical when combined with iron (7Graham D.G.

Furthermore, there is a significant alteration in levels or activities of antioxidant enzymes in the substantia nigra (9Ambani L.M. Van Woert M.H. Murphy S. Arch.

Among many potential consequences of oxidative stress, surges in ROS render DA neurons susceptible to oxidative modification of proteins. Oxidized α-synuclein exhibits an increased tendency to be misfolded and appears to be responsible for neurodegeneration (14Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I.

Oxidative modification of several other proteins, including DJ-1, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1, and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, was also identified (16Choi J. Levey A.I. Weintraub S.T.

Since the tissue content of oxidized proteins tends to be higher in the human substantia nigra compared with other brain regions (19Floor E. Wetzel M.G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), we were particularly interested in the identification of protein targets for oxidative damage and evaluating their functional relevance during DA neuronal death. Neurotoxin-based experimental models have been used to study biochemical changes reminiscent of those occurring in patients with PD (1Dauer W. Przedborski S. Neuron. 2003; 39: 889-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4149) Google Scholar). In our previous study (20Han B.S. Hong H.S. Choi W.S. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. J.

In the present study, we used integrated technologies, including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry, to identify proteins that are altered during 6-OHDA-mediated death. In the present study, we found that expression of 17 protein spots was significantly altered following 6-OHDA treatment (at least 4-fold increase/decrease with a p value of less than 0.05). Among these identified proteins, five spots corresponded to thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases (peroxiredoxins; PRX) that belong to an expanding family of antioxidant enzyme present in a large variety of organisms (22Chae H.Z. Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that PRX may be involved in a wide variety of cellular functions, including apoptosis (24Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 25Fujii J. Ikeda Y. Redox Rep. 2002; 7: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Oxidative modification of PRX was confirmed in 6-OHDA-treated culture and rat brain models of PD. From subsequent study using cultured models of PD, we also found that (i) PRX proteins were oxidatively modified during 6-OHDA- but not 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced DA neuronal death; (ii) co-treatment of antioxidant blocked 6-OHDA-induced oxidation of PRX; and (iii) overexpression of PRX1 prevented 6-OHDA-induced activation of p38 MAPK and caspase-3 through scavenging of ROS, whereas knockdown of PRX1 enhanced most of these events. Our data indicate that the redox state of PRX may play an important role in regulating 6-OHDA-induced apoptotic signaling. Cell Culture—The MN9D DA neuronal cell line was established by somatic fusion between embryonic mesencephalic neurons and N18TG cells (26Choi H.K. Won L.A. Kontur P.J. Hammond D.N. Fox A.P.

MN9D cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 on a 25 μg/ml poly-d-lysine-coated P-100 culture plate and cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Bio Whittaker) in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 for 2-3 days. The medium was subsequently replaced with N2 serum-free defined medium (28Bottestein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following treatment with 100 μm 6-OHDA or 50 μm MPP+ for various times, MN9D cells were solubilized in a sample buffer containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm tributyl phosphine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 150 units/ml endonuclease, and 1% IPG buffer for pH 3-10 nonlinear Immobiline DryStrip (Amersham Biosciences), or in a sample buffer containing 5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 0.25% Tween 20, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% isopropyl alcohol, 12.5% water-saturated butanol, 5% glycerol, and 1% IPG buffer for pH 4-7 linear Immobiline DryStrip. Protein content was determined by two-dimensional Quantikit (Amersham Biosciences). Prior to isoelectric focusing, Immobiline DryStrips (24 or 7 cm) were rehydrated in sample buffer containing 10-1,500 μg of cellular lysate. Gels were run for a total of 100 kV-h for 24-cm DryStrip or 25 kV-h for 7-cm DryStrip using progressively increasing voltage on an Ettan IPGphor (Amersham Biosciences). After equilibration, SDS-PAGE was performed on an 8-18% gradient gel in an Ettan Dalt II System for 24-cm DryStrip or on a 12.5% gel in a Mini-Protean 3 Electrophoresis Cell (Bio-Rad) for 7-cm DryStrip. Gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. In-gel Digestion and Mass Spectrometry—Stained gels were scanned using a densitometer (Powerlook 2100XL; UMAX), and the images were analyzed using the ProteomWeaver software system (Definiens). For in-gel digestion, protein spots of interest were manually excised from the Coomassie-stained 2-DE gels. Gel slices were washed with a buffer containing 25 mm NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile, dried completely using a SpeedVac evaporator dryer (BioTron), and digested with 10 μg/ml trypsin (Promega) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for 18 h. Peptides were solubilized with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and desalted using an in-house column packed with C18 porous beads. Bound peptides were eluted in 0.6 μl of elution buffer (1 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution in 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and spotted onto a MALDI plate (Applied Biosystems). Peptide mixtures were analyzed by a 4700 proteomics analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and peptide masses were matched with the theoretical peptide masses of all proteins from all species using the NCBI or Swiss-Prot data base. Primary Cultures of Mesencephalic Neurons—Primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons were established using ventral mesencephalon removed from Sprague-Dawley rat embryos at gestation day 14.5 (Daehan Biolink, Daejon, Korea) and cultivated as described previously (20Han B.S. Hong H.S. Choi W.S. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5069-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated cells were plated at 1.0 × 105 cells/8-mm diameter Aclar embedding film (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 6.0 g/liter glucose at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 5 or 6 days of in vitro culture, cells were washed with minimal essential medium and treated with 20 μm 6-OHDA or 3 μm MPP+ for the times indicated in the presence or absence of 1 mm NAC. Stereotaxic Surgery and Drug Injection—All procedures were performed in accordance with approved animal protocols and guidelines established by Yonsei University. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (260-290 g; Orient, Suwon, Korea) were anesthetized by injection of chloral hydrate (360 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), positioned in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments), and prepared for surgery as previously described with minor modifications (29Choi S.H. Joe E.H. Kim S.U. Jin B.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5877-5886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rats received a unilateral injection of 5 μl (6 μg) 6-OHDA in the presence or the absence of 2 mm NAC at a rate of 0.5 μl/min into the right substantia nigra (anteroposterior, -5.3; mediolateral, +2.3; dorsoventral, -7.6 mm from the bregma), according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (30Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain:Stereotaxic Coordinates. 4th Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 38-45Google Scholar). Two or three rats were assigned to each condition in one experiment. All injections were performed with a Hamilton syringe equipped with a 26 S gauge beveled needle and attached to a syringe pump (KD Scientific, New Hope, PA). After injection, the needle was left in place for an additional 5 min before slow retraction. Animals treated with ascorbate/saline were used as controls. Tissue Processing, Immunohistochemistry, and Quantitation—Animals were perfused transcardially with a saline solution containing 0.5% sodium nitrate and heparin (1000 units/ml) prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Brains were removed and postfixed overnight in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, incubated in a 30% sucrose solution for 48-72 h at 4 °C until they sank, and sectioned frozen on a sliding microtome in 30-μm-thick coronal sections. Sections were collected and processed for immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) alone or in combination with the oxidized forms of PRX. The unbiased stereological estimation of the total number of TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra was carried out using the optical fractionator, as previously described in full detail (29Choi S.H. Joe E.H. Kim S.U. Jin B.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5877-5886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sampling technique was not affected by tissue volume changes and did not require reference volume determinations. Sampling was done using the Computer-Assisted Stereological Toolbox system, version 2.1.4 (Olympus Denmark A/S, Ballerup, Denmark), using a microscope with a motorized stage run by an IBM-compatible computer. The substantia nigra was delineated at a ×1.25 objective and generated counting areas of 150 × 150 μm. A counting frame (1612 μm2) was placed randomly on the first counting area and moved through all counting areas until the entire delineated area was sampled. Actual counting was carried out using ×100 oil objective. Guard volumes (4 μm from the top and 4-6 μm from the bottom of the section) were excluded from both surfaces to avoid the problem of lost caps, and only the profiles that came into focus within the counting volume (with a depth of 10 μm) were counted. For double immunofluorescent localization of TH and the oxidized forms of PRX, tissue sections were further fixed in 100% methanol for 20 min at -20 °C, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in 0.2 m phosphate buffer at room temperature for 1 h, blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in 0.2 m phosphate buffer at room temperature for 15 min, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-TH (1:2000) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against the oxidized form of PRX (1:200). Tissue sections were rinsed extensively with 0.2 m phosphate buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a mixture of Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes). Following extensive wash with 0.2 m phosphate buffer, stained tissue sections were examined with an AxioImager D1 fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital image analyzer (Carl Zeiss) or an LSM 510 Meta Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss). To assess the number of TH-positive DA neurons or TH-negative cells co-localized with the increased level of the oxidized forms of PRX, manual counts were conducted using 10-15 randomly selected confocal images per condition by an individual who was blind to the treatment conditions. Adjacent tissue sections from each animal were also stained with cresyl violet and subjected to quantitation to validate immunohistochemical determination of nigral neuronal survival. Immunoblot Analysis—To determine total levels of PRX1, the oxidized form of PRX, phospho-p38 MAPK, or cleaved caspase-3, cultures of DA neurons were treated with 6-OHDA for the times indicated. Following treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA and lysed on ice for 10 min in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture. Total protein content was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. An equal amount of soluble proteins was separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted onto prewetted polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and processed for immunoblot analysis as described previously (21Choi W.S. Eom D.S. Han B.S. Kim W.K. Han B.H. Choi E.J. Oh T.H. Markelonis G.J. Cho J.W. Oh Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20451-20460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Cellular lysates were also processed for 2-DE in 7-cm Immobiline DryStrip (pH 3-10 NL) and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit polyclonal antibody against PRX1 (1:3000; Labfrontier, Seoul, Korea); rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes both the sulfinic (Cys51-SO2H) and sulfonic form (Cys51-SO3H) of PRX1 to -4 (1:3000; Labfrontier) (31Woo H.A. Kang S.W. Kim H.K. Yang K.S. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47361-47364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); and rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated form of p38 or the cleaved forms of caspase-3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling). Rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibody (1:3000; Sigma) was used as a loading control. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000; Amersham Biosciences) were used as appropriate. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—Double immunocytochemical labeling of TH and oxidized forms of PRX was performed in primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons as described previously with some modifications (20Han B.S. Hong H.S. Choi W.S. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5069-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were fixed with 100% methanol for 20 min at -20 °C and blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-TH (1:7500; Pel-Freez) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the oxidized forms of PRX (1:400) in blocking solution at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cultures were further incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a mixture of Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200). Cells were then examined with an Axiovert 100 microscope equipped with epifluorescence and a digital image analyzer (Carl Zeiss). Using a ×20 objective lens, TH-positive neurons that were positive for oxidized forms of PRX were counted by examining 16 consecutive fields across the Aclar embedding film (approximately 170-200 TH-positive DA neurons were scored in the untreated control culture). Cells were counted as positive for the oxidized forms of PRX when the fluorescence intensity was strongly increased compared with that typically seen in cells processed without primary antibody. Manual counts were performed from the images captured in a digital image analyzer by an individual who was blind to the treatment conditions. For immunofluorescent labeling of oxidized forms of PRX in MN9D cells, cells were fixed, blocked, and further processed as described above. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as a secondary antibody. Stable Transfection—To establish a stable cell line overexpressing PRX1 (MN9D/PRX1), MN9D cells were transfected with pCI eukaryotic expression vector (Promega) containing full-length human PRX1 cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as previously described with minor modifications (32Oh Y.J. Wang S.C. Moffat M. O'Malley K.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 1995; 2: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For gene silencing studies, MN9D cells were stably transfected with pRNAT-U6.1 containing small hairpin RNA of PRX1 designed as a small hairpin RNA and green fluorescent protein as a reporter sequence (MN9D/shPRX1; Genscript). The sequence of the RNA was 5′-GTGATAGAGCCGATGAATTTATTGATATCCGTAAATTCATCGGCTCTATCACTTTTTT-3′ (sense-loop-antisense-termination signal). Approximately 2 weeks after transfection, G-418-resistant cells (MN9D/PRX1 and MN9D/shPRX1) were selected and expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 500 μg/ml G-418. MN9D/PRX1 and MN9D/shPRX1 cells were characterized by immunoblot analysis as described above. MN9D cells stably transfected with an equivalent plasmid vector alone (MN9D/Neo and MN9D/RNeo) were used as controls. Measurement of ROS—MN9D/PRX1 or MN9D/shPRX1 cells were treated with 100 μm 6-OHDA alone or in combination with 1 mm NAC, and ROS generation was measured and compared with control cells as previously described (21Choi W.S. Eom D.S. Han B.S. Kim W.K. Han B.H. Choi E.J. Oh T.H. Markelonis G.J. Cho J.W. Oh Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20451-20460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 1 μm dihydroethidium for 30 min or 5 μm 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate for 3 h at 37 °C (all reagents were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR)) and washed twice with a buffer containing 144 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 10 mmd-glucose. Images were taken using an Axiovert 100 microscope, and florescence intensity was quantified at 530-nm/590-nm excitation/emission wavelength for dihydroethidium and 488 nm/510 nm for 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate using an FL 600 plate reader (Bio-Tek). Statistics—Data are given as means ± S.E. Significance of difference was determined by one-way ANOVA and post hoc Student's t test. Values of p < 0.001, 0.01, or 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Proteome Analysis of 6-OHDA-treated MN9D Cells—We previously reported that 6-OHDA induces classic apoptosis, including cytochrome c release and caspase activation, whereas MPP+ induces caspase-independent cell death pathways in DA as well as cortical neurons (20Han B.S. Hong H.S. Choi W.S. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5069-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Oh Y.J. Wang S.C. Moffat M. O'Malley K.L. Neurobiol.

We have also proposed that ROS are one of the initial triggers leading to activation of apoptotic signaling following 6-OHDA treatment, whereas ROS are not involved in MPP+-induced cell death in MN9D cells and primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons (20Han B.S. Hong H.S. Choi W.S. Markelonis G.J. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5069-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Choi W.S. Eom D.S. Han B.S. Kim W.K. Han B.H. Choi E.J. Oh T.H. Markelonis G.J.

The objective of the present study was to identify specific target proteins of oxidative damage in DA neuronal cells through analysis of an array of proteins that are potentially altered during the early phase of the ROS surge induced by exposure to 6-OHDA. Following treatment of MN9D cells with 100 μm 6-OHDA for 1-12 h, proteome analysis of 6-OHDA-treated cells and matching untreated controls was performed using integrated technologies including protein separation by 2-DE and identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. A typical Coomassie Blue-stained protein pattern obtained after separation of a 1.5-mg protein sample from untreated MN9D cells is shown in Fig. 1A. More than 1500 matched protein spots ranging from ∼10 to 100 kDa were typically detected in a pI 4-7 or 3-10 NL gel. Among 46 protein spots that were altered following 6-OHDA treatment for 1, 3, 6, and 12 h, expression of 17 protein spots was significantly changed at least 4-fold with a p value of less than 0.05 (n > 3). Fourteen representative regions boxed in Fig. 1A are compared in detail with and without 6-OHDA treatment in Fig. 1B. These altered protein spots were subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and a data base search using either the NCBI or Swiss-Prot data base. Table 1 summarizes the identified proteins with accession number, their -fold change, MOWSE score (35Pappin D.J.C. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr.

https://openalex.org/W1983092821,"During insulin secretion, pancreatic α-cells are exposed to Zn2+ released from insulin-containing secretory granules. Although maintenance of Zn2+ homeostasis is critical for cell survival and glucagon secretion, very little is known about Zn2+-transporting pathways and the regulation of Zn2+ in α-cells. To examine the effect of Zn2+ on glucagon secretion and possible mechanisms controlling the intracellular Zn2+ level ([Zn2+]i), we employed a glucagon-producing cell line (α-TC6) and mouse islets where non-β-cells were identified using islets expressing green fluorescent protein exclusively in β-cells. In this study, we first confirmed that Zn2+ treatment resulted in the inhibition of glucagon secretion in α-TC6 cells and mouse islets in vitro. The inhibition of secretion was not likely via activation of KATP channels by Zn2+. We then determined that Zn2+ was transported into α-cells and was able to accumulate under both low and high glucose conditions, as well as upon depolarization of cells with KCl. The nonselective Ca2+ channel blocker Gd3+ partially inhibited Zn2+ influx in α-TC cells, whereas the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel inhibitor nitrendipine failed to block Zn2+ accumulation. To investigate Zn2+ transport further, we profiled α-cells for Zn2+ transporter transcripts from the two families that work in opposite directions, SLC39 (ZIP, Zrt/Irt-like protein) and SLC30 (ZnT, Zn2+ transporter). We observed that Zip1, Zip10, and Zip14 were the most abundantly expressed Zips and ZnT4, ZnT5, and ZnT8 the dominant ZnTs. Because the redox state of cells is also a major regulator of [Zn2+]i, we examined the effects of oxidizing agents on Zn2+ mobilization within α-cells. 2,2′-Dithiodipyridine (-SH group oxidant), menadione (superoxide generator), and SIN-1 (3-morpholinosydnonimine) (peroxynitrite generator) all increased [Zn2+]i in α-cells. Together these results demonstrate that Zn2+ inhibits glucagon secretion, and it is transported into α-cells in part through Ca2+ channels. Zn2+ transporters and the redox state also modulate [Zn2+]i. During insulin secretion, pancreatic α-cells are exposed to Zn2+ released from insulin-containing secretory granules.

Zn2+ transporters and the redox state also modulate [Zn2+]i. Blood glucose homeostasis is maintained by appropriate secretion of insulin and glucagon from pancreatic islet β- and α-cells, respectively (1Gerich J.E. Charles M.A. Grodsky G.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1976; 38: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 2Jiang G. Zhang B.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E671-E678Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). It is quite clear that when ambient glucose concentrations rise, glucagon secretion is inhibited and insulin secretion is stimulated. The mechanisms that control the suppression of glucagon secretion under high glucose conditions have not been completely agreed upon, but it is likely that α-cells sense and respond to changes in blood glucose through direct and indirect mechanisms (3Gromada J. Franklin I. Wollheim C.B. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 84-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 4Maruyama H. Hisatomi A. Orci L. Grodsky G.M. Unger R.H. J. Clin.

Some of the paracrine/endocrine factors that could facilitate the suppression of glucagon secretion include insulin and other factors released upon β-cell exocytosis, including γ-aminobutyric acid and Zn2+ (3Gromada J. Franklin I. Wollheim C.B. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 84-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 7Gromada J. Hoy M. Buschard K. Salehi A. Rorsman P. J. Physiol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β-cells a fraction of the intracellular Zn2+ pool is stored with insulin in intracellular vesicles as a complex of zinc-insulin (9Emdin S.O. Dodson G.G. Cutfield J.M. Cutfield S.M. Diabetologia. 1980; 19: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The concentration of Zn2+ in these vesicles is about 20 mm (10Hutton J.C. Penn E.J. Peshavaria M. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 11Foster M.C. Leapman R.D. Li M.X. Atwater I. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 525-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Following exocytosis of the intracellular vesicles, it is likely that the Zn2+ released into the extracellular islet space would be transported back into the host cell or into neighboring cells. The effects of β-cell secretory products, Zn2+ and insulin, on glucagon secretion are still controversial and may be species-specific. It was shown that Zn2+ had inhibitory actions on glucagon secretion from rat islets (8Ishihara H. Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Herrera P.L. Wollheim C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 12Franklin I. Gromada J. Gjinovci A. Theander S. Wollheim C.B.

Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 4861-4870Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently it was found that switching off pancreatic artery infusions of Zn2+ stimulated glucagon secretion in rats (14Zhou H. Zhang T. Harmon J.S. Bryan J. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Contrary to these experiments, a lack of Zn2+ effect on glucagon secretion was observed in mouse islets (15Ravier M.A. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).

In addition, a Na+/Zn2+ exchange mechanism that is different from both ZnT1 and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger utilizes the transmembrane electro-chemical Na+ gradient and mediates extrusion of Zn2+ in some cells (24Ohana E.

A Zn2+/H+ antiport mechanism, associated with intracellular ZnTs, could be responsible for Zn2+ accumulation in intracellular organelles (25Sekler I. Sensi S.L. Hershfinkel M. Silverman W.F. Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It is likely that ZnT proteins serve as secondary active transporters, using the gradient of other ions to drive the Zn2+ transport (20Eide D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

These loci include a nonsynonymous polymorphism in the zinc transporter SLC30A8, which is expressed in insulin-producing β-cells (29Chimienti F. Devergnas S. Pattou F. Schuit F. Garcia-Cuenca R.

Based upon these recent linkage studies, the mechanisms of Zn2+ transport as well as the modulation of intracellular Zn2+ in islet cells takes on an important clinical significance. Despite the importance of Zn2+ in islet of Langerhans function, a limited number of articles are dedicated to Zn2+ transport (30Ludvigsen C. McDaniel M. Lacy P.E. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Figlewicz D.P. Formby B. Hodgson A.T. Schmid F.G. Grodsky G.M.

Commun. 2006; 346: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that Zn2+ accumulation into insulin-secreting β-cells occurred by the following two pathways: through membrane Zn2+ transporters under low glucose conditions, and through L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) under high glucose (32Gyulkhandanyan A.V. Lee S.C. Bikopoulos G. Dai F. Wheeler M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9361-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To date, Zn2+ transport mechanisms have not been studied in other islet cell types, including α-cells. Taking into account the Zn2+-rich environment surrounding α-cells, it is expected that they should have an effective mechanism for maintaining Zn2+ homeostasis. Dysfunction of the transporters responsible for Zn2+ export can lead to dramatic changes in cell viability, because an excess of Zn2+ can induce oxidative damage, mitochondrial depolarization, and opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (34Bossy-Wetzel E. Talantova M.V. Lee W.D. Scholzke M.N. Harrop A. Mathews E. Gotz T. Han J. Ellisman M.H. Perkins G.A. Lipton S.A.

In addition, as stated above, Zn2+ released from β-cells may be a required component of the “off switch” for glucagon secretion. Thus the inhibition of glucagon secretion may require Zn2+ transport and the modulation of the cytoplasmic Zn2+ level ([Zn2+]i). α-Cells are electrically active and equipped with different types of channels, including KATP channels and four types of VGCC, which could be involved in regulating Zn2+ as in β-cells (3Gromada J. Franklin I. Wollheim C.B. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 84-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 37Gopel S. Zhang Q. Eliasson L. Ma X.S. Galvanovskis J. Kanno T. Salehi A. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 556: 711-726Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, α-cells may also modulate [Zn2+]i through ZnTs and Zips. Finally, it is well known that free Zn2+ in cells is modulated by redox state and the level of reactive oxygen species in cells (38Maret W. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S1455-S1458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kang Y.J. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2006; 231: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which in turn are regulated by glucose and fatty acid metabolism and β-oxidation. Thus the redox state of the α-cell may also regulate α-cell [Zn2+]i. In this study we showed an inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on glucagon secretion in a glucagon-producing α-cell line (α-TC). Using the Zn2+-selective dye FluoZin-3 AM (32Gyulkhandanyan A.V. Lee S.C. Bikopoulos G. Dai F. Wheeler M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9361-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 40Gee K.R. Zhou Z.L. Ton-That D. Sensi S.L. Weiss J.H. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) we studied, for the first time, Zn2+ transport in intact mouse pancreatic islet α-cells, as well as in the α-TC cell line, and showed the possibility of Zn2+ transport through both Ca2+ channels and Zn2+ influx transporter(s). We demonstrated the expression of ZIP and ZnT family of Zn2+ transporters in α-TC cells, as well as in isolated mouse islets. In addition, we investigated the regulation of [Zn2+]i by oxidizing agents in α-cells. Our results suggest that cytoplasmic Zn2+ homeostasis in α-cells is maintained by a concerted action of Zn2+ transporters, Ca2+ channels, and the redox state of thiol groups. Reagents—Fluorescent dyes FluoZin-3 AM, bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)), rhodamine 123 (Rh123), MitoTracker Red CMXRos, Hoechst 33342, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Dispase II (neutral protease) was from Roche Diagnostics. Carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluorometoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), 2,2′-dithiodipyridine (DTDP), 2-mercaptopyridine N-oxide (pyrithione), N,N,N′,N′,-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine (TPEN), nitrendipine, tolbutamide, tetraethylammonium, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), iodoacetamide, dithioerythritol (DTE), azide, menadione, poly-l-lysine, annexin V-FITC, and propidium iodide were from Sigma. 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE) was from Cayman Chemical Co. ZnSO4 was used in all experiments. α-TC6 Cells—α-TC6 (α-TC) glucagon-producing cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Moriyama, Okayama University, Japan. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 25 mm glucose, l-glutamine, supplemented with 10% bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C and 5% CO2, 95% air. Culture medium was changed every 48 h, and cells were grown in monolayer to 80-90% confluence. The cells were plated onto glass coverslips for fluorescence measurements. Experiments with cells were performed typically 2-3 days after plating. Dispersed Islet Cells from Mouse Insulin Promoter-Green Fluorescent Protein (MIP-GFP) Mice—To identify non-β-cells we used MIP-GFP mice (CD1 background), in which GFP is specifically expressed in the islet β-cells. MIP-GFP mice were a gift from Dr. M. Hara, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL (41Hara M. Wang X. Kawamura T. Bindokas V.P. Dizon R.F. Alcoser S.Y. Magnuson M.A. Bell G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E177-E183Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Islets were isolated as described previously (32Gyulkhandanyan A.V. Lee S.C. Bikopoulos G. Dai F. Wheeler M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9361-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To obtain dispersed cells, isolated islets were incubated for 10 min in Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered solution supplemented with 2 mm EGTA, 3 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Islets then were centrifuged and incubated with dispase II, followed by addition of RPMI 1640 medium with 11.1 mm glucose, 10% bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The suspension was centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in the same medium. The cells were plated on 22-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and maintained for 1-3 days at 37 °C and 5%CO2, 95% air. We selected GFP-negative (non-green) cells for experiments. Glucagon Secretion Assay—α-TC cells were plated onto 24-well plates and cultured for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with l-glutamine supplemented with serum, streptomycin, and penicillin at 37 °C. Culture medium was aspirated, and cells were preincubated for 15 min with buffer containing (mm) 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 NaHCO3, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 20 mm glucose. Buffer was then aspirated, and cells were incubated in 0.5 ml of buffer with 1 or 20 mm glucose with or without different concentrations of Zn2+ for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 450 μl of medium was collected and centrifuged at 2000 rpm, and supernatant was assayed for glucagon using glucagon radioimmuno-assay kit (Linco Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA amount in samples was determined spectrophotometrically for normalization. The procedure for mouse (FVB background) islet glucagon secretion assay was similar. Fluorescent Measurements—During fluorescent measurements we used the incubation and perfusion buffer containing (mm) 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 NaHCO3, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, or the same medium without Ca2+. In selected experiments, to depolarize the cells, 30 or 50 mm NaCl was replaced with 30 or 50 mm KCl. Fluorescent experiments were carried out using an Olympus BX51W1 fluorescent microscope fitted with a 20×/0.95 water immersion objective and cooled CCD camera equipped with a magnification changer (U-TVCAC, Olympus). For excitation, a xenon lamp-based DeltaRam high speed monochromator from Photon Technology International (PTI, Lawrenceville, NJ) was used. For control of the monochromator and video camera, as well as for analysis of fluorescent imaging, ImageMaster 3 software (PTI) was used as we have described previously (32Gyulkhandanyan A.V. Lee S.C. Bikopoulos G. Dai F. Wheeler M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9361-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cells were transferred to an open chamber on the microscope stage for imaging and perfused at 1 ml/min. All time-dependent experiments were performed at 36-37 °C using TC-324B Heater Controller (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). In static experiments a Delta T Culture Dish Controller (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) was used for heating. One to 30 randomly chosen cells were analyzed per coverslip. Dynamic Measurements of Zn2+, Ca2+, Plasma Membrane (ΔΨP), and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm)—For Zn2+ measurements, coverslips with α-TC cells, or dispersed islet cells, were loaded with 2 μm FluoZin-3 AM for 50 min in incubation buffer in the presence of 2 mm glucose at 37 °C and 5% CO2, 95% air. Then coverslips with α-TC cells or islet cells were subsequently incubated for 10 min in the same buffer without dye. FluoZin-3 AM was excited at 480 nm, and emission was measured with a 525-nm band pass filter using 505 nm beam splitter. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were assessed using Fura-2 AM. Coverslips with cells were loaded with 2.5 μm Fura-2 AM for 45 min in incubation buffer under the same conditions as with FluoZin-3 AM. Cells were excited by dual excitation at 340/380 nm, and emission was detected by a 510-nm band pass filter using 415-nm beam splitter. Cell ΔΨP was measured by negatively charged oxonol dye DiBAC4(3). Coverslips with α-TC cells or islet cells were loaded with 100 nm dye for 20 min in incubation buffer. The perfusion solution contained the same concentration of oxonol dye. The excitation and emission wavelengths were similar to FluoZin-3 AM. Mitochondrial ΔΨm was measured by positively charged dye Rh123 with excitation and emission wavelengths similar to FluoZin-3 AM. Cells were loaded with 5 μm Rh123 for 45 min. To minimize possible photodamaging effects, the shutter on the monochromator was closed for 3 s between each acquisition. Measurements of Cells Simultaneously Stained with FluoZin-3 AM, MitoTracker Red CMXRos, and Hoechst 33342—α-TC cells were loaded with 2 μm FluoZin-3 AM for 30 min in incubation buffer in the presence of 2 mm glucose at 37 °C and 5% CO2, 95% air. Then 1 μm of mitochondria-staining dye MitoTracker Red and 2 μm of DNA-specific dye Hoechst 33342 were added, and cells were incubated for 20 min. Cells were washed in incubation buffer, transferred to the chamber on the microscope stage, and maintained at 36-37 °C. Excitation wavelengths for MitoTracker Red and Hoechst 33342 were 540 and 350 nm, respectively, and emission was measured using 660-nm band pass filter and 550-nm beam splitter for Mito-Tracker Red and 465-nm band pass filter and 400-nm beam splitter for Hoechst 33342. Confocal Fluorescent Measurements—Confocal imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope. Coverslips with α-TC cells co-loaded with FluoZin-3 AM (2 μm) and MitoTracker Red (500 nm) or FluoZin-3 AM and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-staining dye FM 4-64 (2 μm) were transferred into the chamber on the stage of the microscope fitted with a 40 × 0.75 water immersion objective. For FluoZin-3 AM and MitoTracker Red, as well as for FluoZin-3 AM and FM 4-64 excitations, the 488- and 514-nm argon laser lines were used, and emissions were acquired using FITC and TRITC set of filters, respectively. The images were analyzed using Zeiss LSM Image software. Measurements of NAD(P)H Fluorescence—Changes in NAD(P)H redox state of α-TC were observed at perfusion of cells with incubation buffer in the presence of 1 mm glucose at 37 °C. The excitation wavelength for NAD(P)H autofluorescence was 360 nm, and emission was measured using 465-nm band pass filter and 400-nm beam splitter. To assess the maximal signal (maximal NAD(P)H reduction) in cells, the mitochondrial electron transport chain was inhibited by azide. Assessment of α-TC Cells Apoptosis and Necrosis—For apoptosis and necrosis measurements, cells plated on glass coverslips were incubated at 37 °C during 1 h with different concentrations of Zn2+ in incubation buffer containing 1 mm glucose. Then coverslips were simultaneously incubated with annexin V-FITC (0.4 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (PI, 1 μm) for 20 min at room temperature in darkness in incubation buffer with 1 mm glucose. Coverslips were washed in the same buffer, transferred to an open chamber on the microscope stage, and maintained at 36-37 °C. The fluorescence of annexin V-FITC was excited at 480 nm and emission measured with 525-nm band pass filter using a 505-nm beam splitter. The PI fluorescence was excited at 540 nm and emission measured with a 660-nm band pass filter using a 550-nm beam splitter. Percent of apoptosis and necrosis was calculated as the ratio of annexin V or PI-positive cells to all cells in the field of view. For these experiments ∼400-500 cells in the field of view were analyzed per coverslip. ZIP and ZnT mRNA Expression Analysis in α-TC6 Cells—Total RNA was isolated from α-TC cells, mouse islets (FVB background), and whole mouse brain using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The extracted total RNA was treated with rDNase I (Ambion, Houston, TX). One μg of the isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was used for amplification in quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). qPCR was performed as described previously (32Gyulkh"
https://openalex.org/W2035092031,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mediate bone resorption in a variety of diseases affecting bone. Like TNF, IL-1 is secreted by osteoclast precursors (OCPs), but unlike TNF, it does not induce osteoclast formation directly from OCPs in vitro. TNF induces IL-1 expression and activates c-Fos, a transcription factor required in OCPs for osteoclast formation. Here, we examined whether IL-1 can induce osteoclast formation directly from OCPs overexpressing c-Fos and whether interaction with bone matrix affects OCP cytokine expression. We infected OCPs with c-Fos or green fluorescent protein retrovirus, cultured them with macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-1 on bone slices or plastic dishes, and assessed osteoclast and resorption pit formation and expression of IL-1 by OCPs. We used a Transwell assay to determine whether OCPs secrete IL-1 when they interact with bone matrix. IL-1 induced osteoclast formation directly from c-Fos-expressing OCPs on plastic. c-Fos-expressing OCPs formed osteoclasts spontaneously on bone slices without addition of cytokines. OCPs on bone secreted IL-1, which induced osteoclast formation from c-Fos-expressing OCPs in the lower Transwell dishes. The bone matrix proteins dentin sialoprotein and osteopontin, but not transforming growth factor-beta, stimulated OCP expression of IL-1 and induced c-Fos-expressing OCP differentiation into osteoclasts. Osteoclasts eroding inflamed joints have higher c-Fos expression compared with osteoclasts inside bone. We conclude that OCPs expressing c-Fos may induce their differentiation directly into osteoclasts by an autocrine mechanism in which they produce IL-1 through interaction with bone matrix. TNF could induce c-Fos expression in OCPs at sites of inflammation in bone to promote this autocrine mechanism and thus amplify bone loss."

https://openalex.org/W1992342774,"A zinc finger protein, GATA4, is one of the hypertrophy-responsive transcription factors and increases its DNA binding and transcriptional activities in response to hypertrophic stimuli in cardiac myocytes. Activation of GATA4 during this process is mediated, in part, through acetylation by intrinsic histone acetyltransferases such as a transcriptional coactivator p300. However, p300-targeted acetylated sites of GATA4 during myocardial cell hypertrophy have not been identified. By mutational analysis, we showed that 4 lysine residues located between amino acids 311 and 322 are required for synergistic activation of atrial natriuretic factor and endothelin-1 promoters by GATA4 and p300. A tetra-mutant GATA4, in which these 4 lysine residues were simultaneously mutated, retained the ability to localize in nuclei and to interact with cofactors including FOG-2, GATA6, and p300 but lacked p300-induced acetylation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activities. Furthermore, coexpression of the tetra-mutant GATA4 with wild-type GATA4 impaired the p300-induced acetylation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activities of the wild type. When we expressed the tetra-mutant GATA4 in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes using a lentivirus vector, this mutant suppressed phenylephrine-induced increases in cell size, protein synthesis, and expression of hypertrophy-responsive genes. However, its expression did not affect the basal state. Thus, we have identified the most critical lysine residues acting as p300-mediated acetylation targets in GATA4 during hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes. The results also demonstrate that GATA4 with simultaneous mutation of these sites specifically suppresses hypertrophic responses as a dominant-negative form, providing further evidence for the acetylation of GATA4 as one of critical nuclear events in myocardial cell hypertrophy.

Mice GATA4 has 11 lysine residues that are putative acetylation targets, 9 of which are concentrated at the C-terminal tails of the first and second zinc finger domains. The amino acid sequences of these two lysine-rich motifs and two zinc finger domains in GATA4 are 100% identical between mice and humans. This region includes cofactor/DNA-binding sites and a nuclear localization signal (11Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol.

Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests or analysis of variance with Scheffe's test where appropriate, with a probability value <0.05 taken to indicate significance. Effect of Mutations of GATA4 Lysines on p300-induced Transcriptional Activation—GATA4 contains two lysine-rich motifs; one is referred to as the N-motif (amino acids 241-267) and is located at the C terminus of the first zinc finger domain, and the other is referred to as the C-motif (amino acids 295-329) and is located at the C terminus of the second zinc finger (Fig. 1A). To investigate the functional roles of lysines in these two motifs, we prepared seven GATA4 mutants in which lysines were substituted by alanines. Mutations M1 (K245A) and M2 (K255A) are located in the N-motif, and mutations M3 (K299A), M4 (K311A), M5 (K318A/K320A), M6 (K322A), and M7 (K326A/K328A) are located in the C-motif. We examined the p300-induced transcriptional activation of ANF and ET-1 promoters by these GATA4 mutants using the PicaGene dual-luciferase assay system produced by TOYO B-Net. Wild-type or mutant GATA4 was expressed with or without p300 in COS7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, coexpression of wild-type GATA4 and p300 resulted in 6- and 22-fold activations of ANF and ET-1 promoter activities, respectively. However, the M4, M5, and M6 mutations within the C-motif of GATA4 markedly reduced the transcriptional activities and responsiveness to p300. The expression of M4-, M5-, or M6-GATA4 with p300 resulted in only slightly higher activation than the expression of p300 alone. In contrast, the M1 and M2 mutations within the N-motif of GATA4 did not affect the transcriptional activity or responsiveness to p300 of either the ANF or the ET-1 promoters. As shown in Fig. 1D, the expression levels of wild-type and mutant GATA4 were similar in the absence and presence of p300. These data demonstrate that the lysine residues within the C-motif of GATA4 are required for p300-induced transcriptional activation. Simultaneous Mutation of 4 Lysines in GATA4 Results in Complete Loss of Its Transcriptional Activation Synergism with p300—Although the M4, M5, and M6 mutations markedly reduced the transcriptional activity of GATA4, these mutants still exhibited residual activities. To obtain a mutant that had completely lost its transcriptional activity, we prepared M456-GATA4, in which 4 lysines (Lys-311, Lys-318, Lys-320, and Lys-322) in the C-motif are simultaneously mutated. The effects of M456-GATA4 on the p300-dependent transcriptional activation of the ANF and ET-1 promoters were examined by luciferase assays. In the presence of wild-type GATA4, p300 activated the ANF (Fig. 2A) and ET-1 (Fig. 2B) promoters in a dose-dependent manner. However, p300 did not activate these promoters at all in the presence of M456-GATA4. As shown in Fig. 2C, wild-type and M456-GATA4 levels were similar in the presence of different doses of p300. Thus, M456-GATA4 exhibited a complete lack of transcriptional activation synergism with p300. M456-GATA4 Loses Its Acetylation and DNA Binding Activity—To examine the levels of p300-induced acetylation of wild-type and M456-GATA4, wild-type or M456-GATA4 was expressed with or without p300 in COS7 cells (Fig. 3A). Nuclear extracts from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GATA4 antibody followed by Western blotting using anti-acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, whereas p300 markedly induced acetylation of wild-type GATA4, the acetylation of M456-GATA4 was completely lacking even in the presence of p300. Acetylated state of wild-type and M456-GATA4 were also confirmed by pulse-labeling experiment (Fig. 3C). In the presence of p300, incorporation of sodium [14C]acetate was clearly detected in wild-type GATA4 but not in M456-GATA4. We next examined whether M456-GATA4 will still be able to interact with p300. The extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-p300 antibody and subjected to Western blotting for GATA4. As shown in Fig. 3D, M456-GATA4 as well as wild-type GATA4 formed complex with p300. These results demonstrate that M456-GATA4 retains the ability to interact with p300 but completely lacks p300-induced acetylation. To examine the effect of M456 mutation on the p300-induced DNA binding activity of GATA4, EMSAs were performed. The same nuclear extracts used to detect the acetylation signals were probed with a radiolabeled double-strand oligonucleotide containing the ET-1 GATA site. As shown in Fig. 3E, a retarded band represented specific binding (lanes 2-4) and was immunoreactive for GATA4 (lanes 5 and 6). These findings demonstrate that this band contains a complex of GATA4 with ET-1 GATA oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 3F, p300 markedly increased the amount of the wild-type GATA4 complex (compare lanes 1 and 2). However, the amount of the M456-GATA4 complex was very low even in the presence of p300 (lane 3). These data demonstrate that mutation of the 4 lysine residues in the C-motif of GATA4 resulted in the loss of its p300-induced acetylation and its DNA binding activity. M456-GATA4 Impairs p300-induced Acetylation and DNA Binding of Wild-type GATA4—M456-GATA4 almost completely lost its p300-induced acetylation but retained the ability to interact with p300. We examined whether M456-GATA4 binds to other GATA4-associating proteins such as FOG-2 and GATA6. Wild-type or M456-GATA4 was expressed with FOG-2 or GATA6 in COS7 cells. Nuclear extracts from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FOG-2 or anti-GATA6 antibody. In each experiment, p300 was coexpressed to enhance the acetylation state of the wild-type but not that of the mutant. As shown in Fig. 4A, similar to wild-type GATA4, M456-GATA4 was able to interact with FOG-2. Concomitantly, M456-GATA4, to an extent similar with wild-type GATA4, interacted with GATA6 as well (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that the acetylation is not essential for GATA4 to bind to its associating proteins such as FOG-2 and GATA6. We subsequently examined the effects of M456-GATA4 coexpression on the p300-induced acetylation and DNA binding of wild-type GATA4. Nuclear extracts from COS7 cells expressing wild-type GATA4 and p300 with or without M456-GATA4 were immunoprecipitated with anti-GATA4 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4C, coexpression of M456-GATA4 repressed the p300-induced acetylation of GATA4. Since M456-GATA4 is almost completely lacking p300-induced acetylation, the detected acetylation signal may be mainly composed of acetylated wild-type GATA4. In addition, coexpression of M456-GATA4 resulted in the reduction of GATA4/DNA binding (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that M456-GATA4 impairs the p300-induced acetylation and DNA binding of wild-type GATA4. M456-GATA4 Acts as a Dominant-negative Form—To clarify whether M456-GATA4 acts as a dominant-negative form, we examined the effects of this mutant on the transcriptional activities induced by wild-type GATA4 and p300. M456-GATA4 was coexpressed with wild-type GATA4 and p300 in COS7 cells, and the promoter activities of ANF and ET-1 were measured by luciferase assays. As shown in Fig. 5, the expressions of wild-type GATA4 with p300 resulted in 12- and 16-fold activations of ANF and ET-1 promoter activities, respectively. These activations were dose-dependently attenuated by the coexpression of M456-GATA4. Coexpression of M456-GATA4 at the maximal dose resulted in almost no activation. Thus, M456-GATA4 acted as a dominant-negative form and repressed the transcriptional activation of the ANF and ET-1 promoters mediated by wild-type GATA4 and p300. M456-GATA4 Represses Hypertrophic Responses in Cardiac Myocytes—Since the M456 mutation is located at the nuclear localization signal, we examined the subcellular localization of M456-GATA4 in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. GFP-fused wild-type or M456-GATA4 was introduced into myocytes by lentiviral infection. As shown in Fig. 6, over 90% of infected myocytes expressed lentivirus-derived GFP proteins. GFP-M456-GATA4 was localized at the nuclei, as was the wild-type GATA4 in cardiac myocytes. The nuclear localization of GFP-M456-GATA4 was confirmed in COS7 cells as well (data not shown). The M456 mutation did not affect the nuclear localization of GATA4. Next, we evaluated the effect of M456-GATA4 on hypertrophic responses induced by an α1-adrenergic agonist, PE, in cardiac myocytes. M456-GATA4 expression plasmid was introduced into cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes by lentiviral infection. As a control, a null or wild-type GATA4 plasmid was introduced. Infected myocytes were then stimulated with saline or 30 μmol/liter PE for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 7A, lentivirus-derived wild-type and M456-GATA4 were stably expressed in both saline-stimulated and PE-stimulated cardiac myocytes. These myocytes were stained with anti-β-MHC antibody. Under the infection of a null or wild-type GATA4 plasmid, PE-stimulated myocytes displayed increase in cell size and myofibrillar organization as compared with saline-treated cells (Fig. 7B). PE stimulation induced about 50% increases in cell surface areas (Fig. 7C). On the other hand, such PE-induced changes were minimal in myocytes expressing M456-GATA4. In the PE-stimulated condition, the surface area of myocytes expressing M456-GATA4 was significantly smaller than that of myocytes with a null or wild-type GATA4 infection. However, in the saline-treated condition, the cell surface areas were similar among any myocytes. As shown in Fig. 7D, protein synthesis rates were increased by PE in myocytes with a null or wild-type GATA4 infection. However, such a PE-induced increase was suppressed in myocytes expressing M456-GATA4. These data demonstrate that exogenous M456-GATA4 specifically represses PE-induced myocardial cell growth. To further examine the effect of M456-GATA4 on myocardial cell hypertrophy, we quantified the mRNA levels of ANF and β-MHC genes by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 7, E and F). PE stimulation increased the ANF and β-MHC mRNA levels in myocytes with a null or wild-type GATA4 infection. However, such PE-induced increases were suppressed by expression of M456-GATA4. These results indicate that exogenous M456-GATA4 inhibits PE-induced expression of hypertrophy-responsive genes in cardiac myocytes. The present study demonstrated that mutations of lysine residues in the C-motif (M4, M5, and M6) of GATA4 reduced p300-induced transcriptional activities, whereas mutations in the N-motif (M1 and M2) did not. M456-GATA4, a mutant in which 4 lysines (Lys-311, Lys-318, Lys-320, and Lys-322) in the C-motif are simultaneously mutated, completely lost p300-induced acetylation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activities. These findings suggest that these 4 lysines are the main acetylation targets in GATA4. Although the simultaneous substitution of 4 lysines in GATA4 was sufficient to ablate the p300-induced acetylation, the exact number and positions of acetylated lysines remain to be determined. To clarify the acetylation status of each lysine residue in GATA4, analysis by mass spectrometry will be needed. Interestingly, Lys-318 and Lys-322 within acetylation targets of GATA4 do not exist in GATA1, GATA2, and GATA3. Conversely, a major acetylation target of GATA3, Lys-305, in the N-motif does not exist in GATA4 (18Yamagata T. Mitani K. Oda H. Suzuki T. Honda H. Asai T. Maki K. Nakamoto T. Hirai H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4676-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although most lysine residues are conserved among different members of the GATA family, acetylation targets may be distinct among different members of this family. The present study identified p300-acetylated lysine residues of GATA4. In addition to p300, CREB-binding protein (CBP) possesses HAT activity and is able to acetylate GATA factors as well as to function as a coactivator of these factors (6Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L.

Although p300 acetylates predominantly the C-motif of GATA1 and increases its DNA binding activity (16Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), CBP acetylates both the N-motifs and the C-motifs without affecting its DNA binding (20Hung H.L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that p300 and CBP have non-redundant roles for modulating the function of GATA factors. Cofactor-specific acetylation sites remain to be identified. Mutant mouse embryos lacking p300 exhibit a reduction in the thickness of the myocardium and suffer embryonic death due to heart failure (38Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). In contrast, knock-out mice of CBP do not exhibit apparent heart defects and die of brain hemorrhage during the embryonic stage (39Tanaka Y. Naruse I. Hongo T. Xu M.J. Nakahata T. Maekawa T. Ishii S. Mech. Dev. 2000; 95: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that p300 plays a more important role than CBP in heart development. However, the precise roles of p300 and CBP in myocardial cell hypertrophy should be clarified by further studies. The GATA4 mutant, M456-GATA4, not only lost p300-induced activities by itself but also inhibited transcriptional activities mediated by wild-type GATA4 and p300. M456-GATA4 retained the ability to interact with its cofactors such as FOG-2, GATA6, and p300 but lost p300-induced acetylation and DNA binding. These findings suggest that M456-GATA4 competes with wild-type GATA4 for binding to p300 and acts as a dominant-negative form. Exogenous M456-GATA4 impaired p300-induced acetylation and DNA binding of wild-type GATA4 and inhibited hypertrophic responses in cardiac myocytes. Not only GATA4 but also multiple DNA-binding transcription factors are involved in myocardial hypertrophic responses. GATA6, another member of the GATA family, is expressed in cardiac tissue during development (40Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 41Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), physically interacts with p300 (42Wada H. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kakita T. Yanazume T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25330-25335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and activates various GATA-dependent cardiac genes with potency similar to GATA4 (43Peterkin T. Gibson A. Loose M. Patient R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). GATA4 and GATA6 functionally cooperate with each other to synergistically activate transcription at a single GATA element of the ANF promoter in cardiac myocytes (15Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 43Peterkin T. Gibson A. Loose M. Patient R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Forced expression of GATA6 in cardiac myocytes induces a striking hypertrophic response (45Liang Q. De Windt L.J. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Markham B.M. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30245-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that exogenous M456-GATA4 competes with endogenous GATA6 as well as GATA4 and inhibits p300-induced GATA6 acetylation during myocardial cell hypertrophy. Other hypertrophy-responsive transcription factors, such as serum-response factor and myocyte enhancer factor-2, also interact with p300 (37Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 44Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 19: 2478-2490Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Since the amount of p300 in cardiac myocytes is limited, competition with these factors for p300 might also be a mechanism of M456-GATA4-mediated inhibition of hypertrophy. In any event, the data obtained in this study provide further evidence for the role of p300-induced GATA4 acetylation in myocardial cell hypertrophy. These findings may be helpful for establishing novel heart failure therapy that targets nuclear events in cardiac myocytes. We thank S. Shibata, M. Kiriyama, N. Chiba, M. Nishikawa, and N.

https://openalex.org/W2171170442,"One of the major determinants of organic solvent tolerance is the increase in membrane phospholipids. Here we report for the first time that an increase in the synthesis of phosphatidic acid is responsible for enhanced phospholipid synthesis that confers tolerance to the organic solvent in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This increase in phosphatidic acid formation is because of the induction of Ict1p, a soluble oleoyl-CoA:lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase. YLR099C (ICT1) was reported to be maximally expressed during solvent tolerance (Miura, S., Zou, W., Ueda, M., and Tanaka, A. (2000) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 66, 4883-4889); however, its physiological significance was not understood. In silico analysis revealed the absence of any transmembrane domain in Ict1p. Domain analysis showed that it has a hydrolase/acyltransferase domain with a distinct lipid-binding motif and a lysophospholipase domain. Analysis of ict1Delta strain showed a drastic reduction in phosphatidic acid suggesting the role of Ict1p in phosphatidic acid biosynthesis. Overexpression of Ict1p in S. cerevisiae showed an increase in phosphatidic acid and other phospholipids on organic solvent exposure. To understand the biochemical function of Ict1p, the gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme was found to specifically acylate lysophosphatidic acid. Specific activity of Ict1p was found to be higher for oleoyl-CoA as compared with palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoAs. This study provides a mechanism for organic solvent tolerance from the point of membrane dynamics in S. cerevisiae."

We describe the heterologous overproduction of DPOR subunits BchN, BchB, and BchL from Chlorobium tepidum in Escherichia coli allowing their purification to apparent homogeneity. The catalytic activity was found to be 3.15 nmol min-1 mg-1 with Km values of 6.1 μm for protochlorophyllide, 13.5 μm for ATP, and 52.7 μm for the reductant dithionite. To identify residues important in DPOR function, 21 enzyme variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and investigated for their metal content, spectroscopic features, and catalytic activity. Two cysteine residues (Cys97 and Cys131) of homodimeric BchL2 are found to coordinate an intersubunit [4Fe-4S] cluster, essential for low potential electron transfer to (BchNB)2 as part of the reduction of the protochlorophyllide substrate. Similarly, Lys10 and Leu126 are crucial to ATP-driven electron transfer from BchL2. The activation energy of DPOR electron transfer is 22.2 kJ mol-1 indicating a requirement for 4 ATP per catalytic cycle. At the amino acid level, BchL is 33% identical to the nitrogenase subunit NifH allowing a first tentative structural model to be proposed.

In photosynthetic organisms two distinct enzymes catalyze the stereospecific reduction of ring D of the aromatic Pchlide to form chlorophyllide (Chlide) (1Fujita Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 2Schoefs B. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 70: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Apel, K. (2001) in Regulation of Photosynthesis (Aro, E.-M., and Anderson, B., eds) pp. 235-252, Kluwer Akademic Publishers, DordrechtGoogle Scholar) (Fig. 1). The first enzyme is the light-dependent Pchlide oxidoreductase (LPOR; NADPH Pchlide oxidoreductase, EC 1.3.1.33). To achieve the chemically difficult reduction of the aromatic ring system, the complex of monomeric LPOR and substrate Pchlide must absorb light energy prior to NADPH-dependent reduction (4Belyaeva O.B.

(2003) in Porphyrin Handbook, Chlorophylls and Bilins: Biosynthesis, Synthesis, and Degradation (Kadish, K. M., Smith, K.

The second Pchlide-reducing enzyme is the light-independent (dark) Pchlide oxidoreductase (DPOR), which shares no amino acid sequence homology to the LPOR system. It consumes ATP to drive the production of Chlide. Some anoxygenic bacteria only encode DPOR (9Xiong J. Inoue K. Bauer C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14851-14856Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whereas angiosperms exclusively produce LPOR. Cyanobacteria, algae, and gymnosperms possess both LPOR and DPOR (1Fujita Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). DPOR enables these organisms to synthesize bChl or Chl in the dark. In bChl-synthesizing organisms the genes bchN, bchB, and bchL encode the three subunits of DPOR. In Chl-synthesizing organisms the corresponding genes are known as chlN, chlB, and chlL (10Suzuki J.Y. Bollivar D.W. Bauer C.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 61-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol.

Protein subunits of DPOR share significant amino acid sequence similarity with NifD, NifK, and NifH, the three subunits of nitrogenase. Among the subunits of DPOR, BchL is most similar to its counterpart NifH sharing 33% amino acid sequence identity (13Burke D.H. Hearst J.E. Sidow A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The remaining two DPOR subunits BchN and BchB are similarly related to NifD and NifK, although sequence identities at ∼15% (for both comparisons) are not as pronounced (14Fujita Y. Matsumoto H. Takahashi Y. Matsubara H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 305-314PubMed Google Scholar). The well characterized nitrogenase protein complex consists of homodimeric Fe-dinitrogenase reductase (Fe-protein, NifH2) and tetrameric MoFe-protein complex ((NifD/NifK)2) responsible for the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia (15Rees D.C. Akif Tezcan F. Haynes C.A. Walton M.Y. Andrade S. Einsle O. Howard J.B. Philos. Transact. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 2005; 363 (1035-1040): 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 16Peters J.W. Fisher K. Dean D.R. Annu. Rev.

NifH2 binds an intersubunit [4Fe-4S] redox cluster symmetrically coordinated by two cysteine residues (Cys97 and Cys132, Azotobacter vinelandii numbering) from each NifH subunit. This redox center is required for the ATP-driven transfer of electrons from ferredoxin to (NifD/NifK)2. These two cysteines are perfectly conserved in all BchL/ChlL protein sequences (10Suzuki J.Y. Bollivar D.W. Bauer C.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 61-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The tetrameric (NifD/NifK)2 MoFe complex bears two types of metallocenters, an [8Fe-7S] cluster (P-cluster) located at the interface of the NifD and NifK subunits and a [1Mo-7Fe-9S-1homocitrate] or MoFe cofactor located within each NifD subunit (Fig. 2). The P-cluster is thought to mediate electron transfer from NifH2 to the MoFe cofactor, where final dinitrogen reduction takes place (18Igarashi R.Y. Seefeldt L.C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 351-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). BchN and BchB together contain only four highly conserved cysteines, compared with six cysteines coordinating the [8Fe-7S] P-cluster in NifD/NifK. Three are found in BchN (Cys21, Cys46, Cys103, C. tepidum numbering) and one in BchB (Cys94). A bridging Fe-S center, although presumably smaller than the P-cluster, may thus be located at the interface of BchN and BchB. Residues involved in MoFe cofactor binding in NifD are not conserved in BchN implying that this part of dinitrogen reduction does not have a counterpart in reduction of Pchlide. Several protein complexes of dinitrogenase reductase and the MoFe-protein have been trapped using (AlF4−) or (BeF3−) together with Mg-ADP, or by deleting Leu127 in the ATP-binding motif of NifH (19Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4157-4165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The [4Fe-4S] cluster of NifH2 has, moreover, been shown to be a better reductant when in complex with the MoFe-protein, than in its uncomplexed form (20Ryle M.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9424-9434Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the BchL subunits of DPOR may similarly catalyze an ATP-driven transfer of electrons from a bound [Fe-S] cluster to catalytic protein complex BchNB containing a second Fe-S redox center. Interestingly ATP-dependent electron transfer is not restricted to nitrogenase. Instead, Fe-dinitrogenase reductase-like subunits also occur in enzymes such as 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase, referred to as “archerases” due to their ability to “activate single electrons” by an ATP-induced change in the redox potential of a [4Fe-4S] center (21Kim J. Hetzel M. Boiangiu C.D. Buckel W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). DPOR from Rhodobacter capsulatus, studied using a homologous expression system, consists of BchL and a BchNB complex. Its enzymatic activity requires both ATP and a reducing agent such as dithionite (22Nomata J. Swem L.R. Bauer C.E. Fujita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), whereas ferredoxin is its physiological electron donor (22Nomata J. Swem L.R. Bauer C.E. Fujita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because R. capsulatus DPOR activity declines rapidly after affinity purification, crude cellular extracts were used in these experiments (22Nomata J. Swem L.R. Bauer C.E. Fujita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have established the first heterologous milligram range production and purification system for Chlorobium tepidum DPOR in Escherichia coli, allowing the kinetic, spectroscopic, and structural characterization of recombinant wild-type and mutant BchNB and BchL including two [4Fe-4S] clusters and their coordinating cysteine residues. Production and Purification of C. tepidum DPOR in E. coli—The complete bchNBL-operon from C. tepidum (strain ATCC 49652) was PCR-amplified using primers CAGGATCCATGATGCCGGTTTCAAG and CAATGCGGCCGCTTACTGCCAGCCACC and cloned into BamHI and NotI sites of pGEX-6P-1 to yield pGEX-bchNBL. The bchL gene was analogously amplified using primers CAGGATCCATGAGTTTAGTATTGGCC and CAATGCGGCCGCTTACTGCCAGCCACC and cloned into BamHI and NotI sites of pGEX-6P-1 to generate pGEX-bchL. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus RIL to produce the BchNBL complex or only BchL. Cells were cultivated at 17 °C in 500 ml of LB medium with 1 mm Fe(III)-citrate. Protein production was induced by 50 μm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside at 0.6 OD578. After 16 h of cultivation 1.7 mm dithionite was added and cultivation was continued without agitation for 2 h at 18 °C in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratories, Grass Lake, MI) to allow [Fe-S] cluster formation. All remaining steps were performed under anaerobic conditions at oxygen partial pressure below 1 ppm (Oxygen detector, Coy Laboratories, Grass Lake, MI). Solutions were N2-saturated prior use. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 m glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol), and disrupted by a single passage through a French press at 1500 p.s.i. into an anaerobic bottle. Following 60 min of centrifugation at 175,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was added to 500 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with lysis buffer. After washing with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm dithiothreitol (wash buffer) the recombinant fusion protein GST-BchN in complex with BchB or GST-BchL alone were eluted using 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. Fractions containing the BchNB complex or GST-BchL were identified by SDS-PAGE. Purification of the Ternary BchNBL Complex—To obtain a stable ternary DPOR complex, all steps of the affinity purifications were carried out in the presence of 2 or 10 mm (BeF3−), or 100 or 200 μm (AlF4−) and 5 mm Mg-ADP. Cell-free extracts were incubated with metallofluorides and Mg-ADP 30 min prior to affinity chromatography. Site-directed Mutagenesis of DPOR Genes and Ribosomal Binding Sites—Up to four nucleotides of the plasmid pGEX-bchNBL were exchanged using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotides to incrementally optimize the ribosomal binding site of bchB (exchanged nucleotides underlined) were: GACGAAAAGCAAAGAGCAATCATGCGTTTAGC; GACGAAAAGGAAACAGTATTCATGCGTTTAGC. Mutations to optimize the ribosomal binding site of bchL were: CGATAAACCAATTGACGTCAATGATTCCATGAGTTTAG; CGATAAACCAATTGACGACACTGTTTTCATGAGTTTAG; and CGATAAACCAATTGAGGAAACAGTATTCATGAGTTTAG. This expression construct was termed pGEX-bchNBL*. Point substitutions in BchN were introduced using the oligonucleotides: C8S, GTTCAAGCGATAGCCAGATTCTCAAAG; C21S, CCACAGCTTCAGCGGCCTGGCCTG; C25S, CGGCCTGGCCAGTGTCGGCTGGC; C46S, GGTACCCACACCAGCGCGCACTTTCTCC; C103S, CCTGCTTTCTTCCAGTACCCCCGAAGTC; C153S, GTGCCCTTCAGCCCCGAAGCTCC; C220S, CTGTCGCGCGTCAGCTCGCGCCTG; and C309S, GGAGGTTGTCGAGAGCAGCAGCGCC. Oligonucleotides for the exchange of codons in bchB were: C94S, GTAGCCCCGAGTAGCAGCACGGCGC; C94A, CCCGAGTGCCAGCACGGC; C217S, CGTGAGATCGGTAGCCAAGCTGCCGG; C373S, GGAGCTGGTCAGCGGCACCCAG; C382S, CGGCACAGCAGCCGCAAGCTCG; and C389A, ACGTGCCCGCCATGGTCATTTC.

Protein Concentrations—Concentrations of GST fusion proteins in crude cellular extracts were determined using the GST-detection module (GE Healthcare). The concentration of purified proteins was determined employing the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay kit (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence Determination—Edman degradation was used to confirm the identity of purified proteins and quantify protein subunits from Western blots. UV-Visible Light Absorption Spectroscopy—UV-visible light spectra of purified recombinant BchNB complexes and BchL were recorded using a V-550 spectrophotometer (Jasco, Groß Umstadt, Germany) under strict anaerobic conditions. Iron Determination Method—Protein-bound iron was determined colorimetrically with o-phenantroline after acid denaturation of purified BchNB or BchL (24Lovenberg W. Buchanan B.B. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3899-3913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The iron content of wild-type BchNB and BchL was confirmed by commercial inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (CURRENTA Bayer-Analytics, Leverkusen, Germany). Detection of Potential Flavins—Standard detection methods for FMN and FAD cofactors were performed as described elsewhere (25Yu S.W. Kim Y.R. Kang S.O. Biochem.

J. 2007; 402: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Analysis of a Potential Heme Cofactor—The presence of a potential heme cofactor was screened as described elsewhere (27Sun W. J. Chem. Sci. 2005; 117: 317-322Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Pchlide Preparation—Pchlide was isolated from the bchL-deficient R. capsulatus strain ZY5 as described earlier (23Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Pchlide Reduction Assay—DPOR activity was measured in 250-μl assays in 100 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm Pchlide, and 10 mm dithiothreitol as electron donor and an ATP regenerating system (20 mm creatine phosphate and 20 units of creatine phosphokinase/assay). This standard DPOR assay was supplemented with 30–100 μl of cell-free E. coli extract containing overproduced GST-BchN, BchB, and BchL. In DPOR reconstitution assays, 20 μg of BchNB complex and 20–60 μg of GST-BchL fusion protein were added. After 30–70 min at 35 °C under strict anaerobic conditions in the dark, reactions were stopped by 1 ml of acetone. Pchlide and Chlide in supernatants obtained by centrifuging for 10 min at 12,000 × g were spectrophotometrically quantified using extinction coefficient ϵ626 = 30.4 mm-1 cm-1 for Pchlide (23Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and ϵ665 = 74.9 mm-1 cm-1 for Chlide (28McFeeters R.F. Chichester C.O. Whitaker J.R. Plant Physiol. 1971; 47: 609-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the ability of ferredoxin to function as elctron donor, the reconstitution assay was supplemented with a ferredoxin regenerating system (13 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 1.1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Torula yeast (Sigma), 1.64 mm NADP+, and 0.025 units of ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase from spinach (Sigma)). The assay was also supplemented with commercially available ferredoxins from Clostridium, Porphyra, or spinach (Sigma) or with recombinantly produced ferredoxin from Synechococcus (29Dammeyer T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27081-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 25 μg/ml, respectively. Activation Energy of DPOR Catalysis—To determine the activation energy of ATP-driven DPOR catalysis, the standard assay was repeated between 291 and 319 K. The initial rate of Chlide formation was used to calculate the rate constant at each temperature and the activation energy was determined by the Arrhenius equation, ln k=(−Eact/R·T)+C(Eq. 1) where k is the rate constant, Eact the activation energy, R the gas constant (8.314 kJ mol-1 K-1), T the temperature (K), and c a reaction constant. CN- Inhibition of DPOR—To analyze the inhibitory effect of CN- on DPOR catalysis, standard DPOR assays were carried out in the presence of 0–60 mm sodium cyanide. Molecular Mass Determination—Analytical gel permeation chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with wash buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated with protein standards (Molecular Weight Marker Kit MW-GF 1000, Sigma) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. A 15-μl sample of purified BchNB or BchL (∼45 μg) was run under identical conditions (30Layer G. Verfurth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Molybdenum Cofactor Analysis—To identify a possible molybdenum cofactor coordinated by BchNB, the nit-1 reconstitution assay supplemented with 4 μg of BchNB was used (31Havemeyer A. Bittner F. Wollers S. Mendel R. Kunze T. Clement B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34796-34802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 1.2 mg of BchNB were used to detect the stable oxidation product FormA of the cofactor (32Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Fed. Proc. 1982; 41: 2608-2612PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent product dephosphorylation, sample preparation, and HPLC analysis were performed as published (33Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). DPOR Production by Strains of E. coli Defective in Molybdenum Uptake—DPOR was produced by transforming pGEX-bchNBL* into E. coli RK-5207, a strain unable to import molybdenum from the medium (34Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Campbell A.M. del Campillo-Campbell A. Villaret D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To overcome the phenotype of the RK-5207 mutant, DPOR was concurrently produced in the presence of 1 and 10 mm Na2MoO4 in LB medium. DPOR activity was tested in cell-free extracts. Molybdenum and Vanadium Determination by ICP-MS—To rule out the involvement of molybdenum or vanadium in DPOR catalysis ICP-MS was performed (36Llamas A. Otte T. Multhaup G. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18343-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Simons A. Ruppert T. Schmidt C. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Reed J. Masters C.L. White A.R. Cappai R. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. Multhaup G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9310-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Samples containing 5 μg of purified protein were applied to the ICP-MS. C. tepidum DPOR Produced in E. coli Is Enzymatically Active—The complete bchNBL operon of the thermophilic green sulfur bacterium C. tepidum was cloned into a standard E. coli expression vector, producing the DPOR subunit BchN as an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (pGEX-bchNBL). However, amounts of recombinant proteins and DPOR activity were found to be low. Replacing the C. tepidum-type ribosomal binding site upstream of bchB (CCAACGAACCAA) and bchL (CCTCTATCATAC) with an E. coli type ribosomal binding site (GGAAACAGTATT) resulted in an expression vector (pGEX-bch-NBL*) that allows significant amounts of BchB and BchL to be produced (data not shown). Concomitantly, the DPOR activity of E. coli cell extracts increases from 0.29 to 3.15 nmol min-1 mg-1 (standard DPOR assay, 35 °C) (Fig. 3B, traces a–d), a significant improvement in specific activity compared with ∼40 pmol min-1 mg-1 for DPOR from R. capsulatus cell-free extracts (23Fujita Y. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23583-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Despite distinct homology to nitrogenase, DPOR activity does not require further enzymes, such as molybdenum cofactor biosynthesizing or incorporating proteins, known to be essential to nitrogenase-producing organisms. Orthologues of genes encoding these proteins are not found in the genome of the E. coli production host. Purification of the Heterotetrameric BchNB Complex—DPOR was maintained under strict anaerobic conditions throughout, including during cell harvesting, cell disruption, protein purification, and activity assays. BchN was purified from E. coli pGEX-bchNBL* extracts. GST-BchN fusion protein was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose, washed extensively, and either eluted intact with 10 mm glutathione (Fig. 3A, lane 2) or liberated from bound GST by PreScission protease treatment (Fig. 3A, lane 3). SDS-PAGE analyses confirm the masses of GST-BchN (Mr = 74,000) or BchN (Mr = 47,000) and reveal stoichiometric amounts of a second protein (Mr = 59,000) (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). By N-terminal amino acid sequencing BchB was identified in equimolar amounts. The molecular mass of the BchNB complex was estimated to be Mr = 210,000 by gel filtration (Fig. 4C) implying a stoichiometry of 2BchN (46,643 Da each) and 2BchB (58,968 Da each). Henceforth the complex is therefore denoted (BchNB)2. Overall, we purified 2 mg of pure (BchNB)2 complex per liter of medium. Purification of the Homodimeric BchL Complex—To allow reconstitution of DPOR, the subunit BchL was separately purified from E. coli extracts. The GST-BchL fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography and eluted as GST fusion protein with 10 mm glutathione buffer or cleaved off GST by PreScission protease. SDS-PAGE analysis indicates a single protein of Mr = 57,000 for GST-BchL (Fig. 3A, lane 4) or Mr = 30,000 for BchL. Analytical gel filtration revealed a relative molecular mass of about 60,000 (Fig. 4C) for BchL indicating that purified BchL from C. tepidum is homodimeric, henceforth denoted BchL2. Overall, 1.5 mg of pure BchL2 were recovered from 5 liters of E. coli culture. Reconstitution of DPOR Activity—To reconstitute DPOR activity in vitro, 20 μg (0.1 nmol) of (BchNB)2 and 20–60 μg (0.7–2 nmol) of BchL were assayed using 20 μm Pchlide in the presence of 10 mm dithionite as reductant, 2 mm ATP, and an ATP regenerating system. After 20 min incubation under anaerobic conditions at 35 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 80% (v/v) acetone. Photometric analysis indicated that the reconstituted C. tepidum enzyme efficiently converts Pchlide (absorbance maximum 626 nm) into Chlide (absorbance maximum 665 nm; Fig. 3B, trace e). Chlide production was not detected if BchNB (trace f), BchL (trace g), dithionite, or the ATP regenerating system were omitted, or when the assay was performed under aerobic conditions (data not shown). Kinetic Properties of DPOR Catalysis—To establish the Km values for C. tepidum DPOR we determined the initial velocity of Chlide formation over a broad range of Pchlide, ATP, and dithionite concentrations using the outlined DPOR assay and saturating concentrations for the residual substrates. For Pchlide, ATP, and the artificial co-substrate dithionite, Chlide formation followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparent Km for Pchlide was found to be 6.1 μm, slightly lower than the 10.6 μm measured for DPOR from R. capsulatus (22Nomata J. Swem L.R. Bauer C.E. Fujita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Km of C. tepidum DPOR for ATP was 13.5 μm, and 52.7 μm for dithionite (supplemental data Fig. 1). Ferredoxin-dependent C. tepidum DPOR Activity—To identify the true electron donor of DPOR, we replaced dithionite with [2Fe-2S]-ferredoxins from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, Porphyra umbilicalis, Spinacia oleracea, and with a [4Fe-4S]-ferredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum in standard DPOR assays, supplemented with a ferredoxin-regenerating system: glucose 6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Torula yeast (Sigma), NADP+, and ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase from spinach (Sigma). Only the ferredoxin from Synechococcus achieved 10% of the dithionite-supported DPOR activity. As other ferredoxins fail to sustain DPOR activity, we propose that a plant-type [2Fe-2S]-ferredoxin might be the electron donor for C. tepidum DPOR in vivo, corroborating the observation that [2Fe-2S]-ferredoxin from maize is an electron donor for DPOR from R. capsulatus (22Nomata J. Swem L.R. Bauer C.E. Fujita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic Properties of Pchlide Reduction by C. tepidum DPOR—Initial rates of Chlide formation were used to calculate rate constants at various temperatures. An Arrhenius plot of ln k versus 1/T indicates an activation energy for DPOR electron transfer of 22.2 kJ mol-1 (Fig. 3C), only slightly higher than the 18.8 kJ mol-1 reported for light-driven Pchlide reduction by LPOR (6Heyes D.J.

A. 2002; 99: 11145-11150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) but dramatically lower than the 90–97 kJ mol-1 required for the electron transfer from the Fe-protein to the MoFe-protein of nitrogenase (38Mensink R.E. Haaker H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) G"
https://openalex.org/W2009378702,"Synechocystis PCC 6803 has a high demand for iron (10 times greater than Escherichia coli) to sustain photosynthesis and is unusual in possessing at least two putative iron-binding proteins of a type normally associated with ATP-binding cassette-type importers. It has been suggested that one of these, FutA2, binds ferrous iron, but herein we clearly demonstrate that this protein avidly binds Fe(III), the oxidation state preference of periplasmic iron-binding proteins. Structures of apo-FutA2 and Fe-FutA2 have been determined at 1.7 and 2.7A, respectively. The metal ion is bound in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal arrangement with no exogenous anions as ligands. The metal-binding environment, including the second coordination sphere and charge properties, is consistent with a preference for Fe(III). Atypically, FutA2 has a Tat signal peptide, and its inability to coordinate divalent cations may be crucial to prevent metals from binding to the folded protein prior to export from the cytosol. A loop containing the His(43) ligand undergoes considerable movement in apo-versus Fe-FutA2 and may control metal release to the importer. Although these data are consistent with FutA2 being the periplasmic component involved in iron uptake, deletion of another putative ferric binding protein, FutA1, has a greater effect on the accumulation of iron and is more analogous to a DeltafutA1DeltafutA2 double mutant than DeltafutA2. Here, we also discover that there is a reduced level of ferric FutA2 in the periplasm of the DeltafutA1 mutant providing an explanation for its severe iron-uptake phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2046439750,"We examined the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) inhibition in airway smooth muscle hypertrophy, a structural change found in patients with severe asthma. LiCl, SB216763, and specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) against GSK-3beta, each of which inhibit GSK-3beta activity or expression, increased human bronchial smooth muscle cell size, protein synthesis, and expression of the contractile proteins alpha-smooth muscle actin, myosin light chain kinase, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, and SM22. Similar results were obtained following treatment of cells with cardiotrophin (CT)-1, a member of the interleukin-6 superfamily, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a proasthmatic cytokine. GSK-3beta inhibition increased mRNA expression of alpha-actin and transactivation of nuclear factors of activated T cells and serum response factor. siRNA against eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2Bepsilon (eIF2Bepsilon) attenuated LiCl- and SB216763-induced protein synthesis and expression of alpha-actin and SM22, indicating that eIF2B is required for GSK-3beta-mediated airway smooth muscle hypertrophy. eIF2Bepsilon siRNA also blocked CT-1- but not TGF-beta-induced protein synthesis. Infection of human bronchial smooth muscle cells with pMSCV GSK-3beta-A9, a retroviral vector encoding a constitutively active, nonphosphorylatable GSK-3beta, blocked protein synthesis and alpha-actin expression induced by LiCl, SB216763, and CT-1 but not TGF-beta. Finally, lungs from ovalbumin-sensitized and -challenged mice demonstrated increased alpha-actin and CT-1 mRNA expression, and airway myocytes isolated from ovalbumin-treated mice showed increased cell size and GSK-3beta phosphorylation. These data suggest that inhibition of the GSK-3beta/eIF2Bepsilon translational control pathway contributes to airway smooth muscle hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. On the other hand, TGF-beta-induced hypertrophy does not depend on GSK-3beta/eIF2B signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1972342888,"Different Na+/Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporters of the SLC6a family have been shown to form dimers or oligomers in both intracellular compartments and at the cell surface. In contrast, the glycine transporters (GlyTs) GlyT1 and -2 have been reported to exist as monomers in the plasma membrane based on hydrodynamic and native gel electrophoretic studies. Here, we used cysteine substitution and oxidative cross-linking to show that of GlyT1 and GlyT2 also form dimeric complexes within the plasma membrane. GlyT oligomerization at the cell surface was confirmed for both GlyT1 and GlyT2 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy. Endoglycosidase treatment and surface biotinylation further revealed that complex-glycosylated GlyTs form dimers located at the cell surface. Furthermore, substitution of tryptophan 469 of GlyT2 by an arginine generated a transporter deficient in dimerization that was retained intracellulary. Based on these results and GlyT structures modeled by using the crystal structure of the bacterial homolog LeuTAa, as a template, residues located within the extracellular loop 3 and at the beginning of transmembrane domain 6 are proposed to contribute to the dimerization interface of GlyTs.

After presynaptic release and postsynaptic receptor activation, neurotransmitters have to be rapidly removed from the synaptic cleft in order to allow synaptic transmission to proceed with high spatial and temporal resolution. This is achieved by neurotransmitter transporters located in the plasma membrane of nerve terminals and adjacent glia cells. The family of Na+/Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporters (SLC6a) includes transporters for γ-aminobutyric acid (GAT1 to -3), 5The abbreviations used are: GAT, γ-aminobutyric acid transporter; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; CRFR1, corticotropine-releasing factor receptor 1; CuP, copper o-phenanthroline; DAT, dopamine transporter; EL, extracellular loop; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FRETc, corrected FRET; GlyT, glycine transporter; HEK 293T cells, human embryonic kidney 293T cells; His, heptahistidyl; NET, norepinephrine transporter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SERT, serotonin transporter; TM, transmembrane domain; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; WT, wild type; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. glycine (GlyT1 and -2), dopamine (DAT), serotonin (SERT), and norephinephrine (NET) (1Torres G.E.

All of these transporters display significant sequence similarity and share a common membrane topology with 12 transmembrane segments (TMs), a large second extracellular loop (EL2) connecting TM3 and TM4, and cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions. Although the functional unit of Na+/Cl--dependent transporters is thought to be a monomer, there is increasing evidence that these transporters form dimers or even higher oligomers within the plasma membrane (4Farhan, H., Freissmuth, M., and Sitte, H. H. (2006) Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 233-249Google Scholar). Oxidative treatment of the DAT produces dimers and tetramers due to intermolecular disulfide bond formation between two cysteine residues, Cys243 and Cys306, located within TM4 and at the end of EL3, respectively (5Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 6Hastrup H. Sen N. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45045-45048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, chemical cross-linking and co-isolation of differentially tagged transporter polypeptides has shown that the recombinant SERT forms oligomers in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (7Jess U. Betz H. Schloss P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 44-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, for the GAT, DAT, and SERT it has been shown that co-expression of the transporter polypeptides fused to cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) with the respective yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged protein results in a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal, suggesting that at least dimers of these transporters exist (9Schmid J.A.

A possible oligomerization interface has been identified within TM2 of GAT1, where both the disruption of a leucine heptad motif and substitution of polar amino acid residues caused intracellular retention of the transporter and a loss of the FRET signal (11Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Korkhov V.M. Farhan H. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55728-55736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Also, x-ray crystallography of a bacterial ortholog of the SLC6a transporter family, LeuTAa, revealed that this transporter forms homodimers (13Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Together, all of these data support the idea of Na+/Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporters being oligomeric proteins. There is, however, one reported exception from this rule, the glycine transporters GlyT1 and GlyT2 (14Horiuchi M. Nicke A. Gomeza J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Lopez-Corcuera B. Alcantara R. Vazquez J. Aragon C. J. Biol.

These transporters mediate the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine from the extracellular space into glial cells (GlyT1) and glycinergic neurons (GlyT2), respectively (3Eulenburg V. Armsen W. Betz H. Gomeza J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Studies on GlyT-deficient mice have shown that, after birth, GlyT1 is essential for removing glycine from postsynaptic glycine receptors (17Gomeza J. Hulsmann S. Ohno K. Eulenburg V. Szoke K. Richter D. Betz H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 785-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), whereas GlyT2 is required for the reuptake of glycine into the presynaptic terminal (18Gomeza J. Ohno K. Hulsmann S. Armsen W. Eulenburg V. Richter D.W. Laube B. Betz H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Additionally, GlyT1 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission by controlling the occupancy of the glycine binding site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (19Dingledine R. Kleckner N.W. McBain C.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 268: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Gabernet L. Pauly-Evers M. Schwerdel C. Lentz M. Bluethmann H. Vogt K. Alberati D.

Evidence for a predominantly monomeric state of these transporters came from two independent studies that failed to detect oligomeric GlyTs within the plasma membrane. Both hydrodynamic analysis of GlyT1 solubilized from rat spinal cord (15Lopez-Corcuera B. Alcantara R. Vazquez J. Aragon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2239-2243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and affinity purification of surface-labeled recombinant GlyT1 and GlyT2 followed by blue native PAGE (14Horiuchi M. Nicke A.

A. 2001; 98: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) provided evidence for GlyTs being monomers at the cell surface. Dimers and oligomers were only detected in intracellular membranes and suggested to represent overexpression artifacts (14Horiuchi M. Nicke A. Gomeza J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, we used a combination of mutagenesis and cysteine-mediated cross-linking as well as FRET analysis in living cells to reexamine whether GlyTs form oligomers. Our data indicate that these transporters are dimers not only in intracellular compartments but also in the plasma membrane of HEK 293T cells. Homology Modeling—The crystal structure of the bacterial leucine transporter LeuTAa (Protein Data Bank code 2A65) was used as a template to build a homology model of GlyT2. To this end, the amino acid sequence of GlyT2 (accession no. Q761V0) (22Ebihara S. Yamamoto T. Obata K. Yanagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The remaining sequence was aligned with LeuTAa according to Yamashita et al. (13Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional models (10 structures) of GlyT1 and GlyT2 were built from the aligned sequences on a Silicon Graphics Octane R12000 work station using the MODELLER program (23Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The models resulting in the lowest root mean square deviation as compared with the original LeuTAa structure were retained for analysis without further refinement. Dimers of GlyT2 were created by juxtaposing two transporter molecules using Thr464 as an anchoring point. Figures were generated using PyMOL software (Delano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA). cDNA Constructs and Heterologous Expression—An expression construct for the human GlyT1c was kindly provided by Dr. Katherine Fisher (Groton Laboratories, Pfizer, NY). The GlyT2 cDNA was isolated from mouse brain stem mRNA using standard cloning techniques. N-terminal heptahistidyl (His), FLAG, and Myc tags were added by PCR-based mutagenesis. After subcloning into the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen), the respective substitutions were introduced by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For fluorescence analysis, the coding regions of GlyT1 and GlyT2 were subcloned by PCR into pECFP-C1 or pEYFP-C1 (Clontech-Takara Bio Europe, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) to create CFP- or YFP-tagged GlyT1 or GlyT2, respectively. All constructs were verified by sequencing, and all surface-expressed transporters were shown to be functional upon heterologous expression in HEK 293T cells as revealed by [3H]glycine uptake measurements (data not shown). An expression construct for the human DAT (24Giros B. el Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Marc G. Caron (Duke University, Durham, NC), and a membrane-bound form of YFP (25Hein P. Frank M. Hoffmann C. Lohse M.J. Bunemann M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Viacheslav Nikolaev (University of Würzburg, Germany). HEK 293T cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (all reagents from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded on the day prior to transfection into 6-well plates, and transfection was performed at 70-85% confluence using the Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For GlyT1 expression, GripTite 293 cell lines (Invitrogen) stably expressing GlyT1, GlyT1L343C, and GlyT1C116A;L343C were generated and seeded 48 h before the experiment. Oxidative Cross-linking—Cross-linking experiments were performed 48-72 h after transfection. Adherent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or HEPES buffered salt solution (130 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm NaOH/HEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated with 0.1-0.5 mm CuSO4 and 0.8-2 mm o-phenanthroline (CuP) in PBS or HEPES buffered salt solution for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by removal of the reagent and incubation of the cells with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide in PBS for 15-20 min. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.25% (w/v) desoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science), and 50 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4. After centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g, the protein content in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein assay (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany), and 10 μg of supernatant protein were mixed with the appropriate volume of 4× nonreducing loading buffer (Invitrogen) prior to separation by SDS-PAGE on 3-8% Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to either nitrocellulose (Whatman, Dassel, Germany) or polyvinylidene fluoride (Amersham Biosciences) membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder for at least 30 min prior to a ≥30-min incubation with primary antibodies directed against either the N terminus of GlyT2 (polyclonal rabbit) (18Gomeza J.

Neuron. 2003; 40: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), DAT (polyclonal rabbit, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), the Myc epitope (polyclonal rabbit, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) (all diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer), or the FLAG epitope (monoclonal mouse; Sigma; 4 μg/ml). After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% (w/v) Tween 20, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen) and detected with the SuperSignal kit (Pierce). Affinity Purification of His-tagged GlyT2—HEK 293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs and, 48 h later, lysed in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.2% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside and 1 mm Pefabloc SC. The lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and 190 μg of supernatant protein were incubated under continuous agitation with Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in the aforementioned lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mm imidazole for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with lysis buffer containing 30 mm imidazole and 0.075% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside, agarose-bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS loading buffer (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 25 °C. Functional Characterization of GlyT2—His-GlyT2WT or His-GlyT2T464C was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes as described previously (14Horiuchi M. Nicke A. Gomeza J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Glycine (30 μm)-induced currents were monitored using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique as described previously (26Dutertre S. Nicke A. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30460-30468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The oocytes were treated with 5 mm CuP for 15 min, and glycine-induced currents were measured again. To analyze the efficacy of CuP-induced cross-linking, His-tagged proteins were isolated from detergent extracts of these oocytes as described (14Horiuchi M. Nicke A. Gomeza J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and subjected to Western blot analysis. Dimers of 200 kDa were only seen after CuP treatment of His-GlyT2T464C but not of untreated or His-GlyT2WT-expressing cells (data not shown). Surface Biotinylation—Surface biotinylation of transfected HEK 293T cells with 1 mm NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) was performed essentially as described (27Eulenburg V. Becker K. Gomeza J. Schmitt B. Becker C.M. Betz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After biotinylation, cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads (60 μl; Pierce) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound biotinylated proteins were eluted by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C with 30 μl of 1× loading buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.6 mm dithiothreitol. Aliquots of the lysates (15 μg of protein) and biotinylated fractions (30 μl) were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—FRET signals (28Schmid J.A. Sitte H.H. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2003; 15: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were measured with an epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200) using the “three-filter method” according to Xia and Liu (29Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Images were taken from HEK 293 cells maintained and transfected as described previously (30Seidel S. Singer E.A. Just H. Farhan H. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Holy M. Koppatz K. Krivanek P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using a ×63 oil objective and a LUDL filter wheel that allows for rapid exchange of filters. The system was equipped with the following fluorescence filters: CFP filter (ICFP; excitation = 436 nm, dichroism = 455 nm, emission = 480 nm), YFP filter (IYFP; excitation = 500 nm, dichroism = 515 nm, emission = 535 nm), and FRET filter (IFRET; excitation = 436 nm, dichroism = 455 nm, emission = 535 nm). The acquisition of the images was done with MetaMorph version 4.6. (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA). Background fluorescence was subtracted from all images, and fluorescence intensity was measured at the plasma membrane and in cytosolic regions in all images. To calculate a normalized FRET signal (NFRET), we used the following equation, NFRET=IFRET−a×IYFP−b×ICFPIYFP×ICFP(Eq. 1) where a and b represent the bleed-through values for YFP and CFP. All NFRET values are expressed as means ± S.E. Corrected FRET (FRETc) images were obtained according to Ref. 31Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar. Briefly, after background subtraction from all three images, CFP and YFP images were multiplied with their corresponding bleed-through value. The following equation was used for the calculation of FRETc images, FRETc = FRET - (b × CFP) - (a × YFP). Confocal Microscopy—GlyT cell surface expression was visualized by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss Axiovert 200-LSM 510 confocal microscope (argon laser, 30 milliwatts; helium/neon laser, 1 milliwatt) equipped with an oil immersion objective (Zeiss Plan-Neofluar ×40/1.3). In brief, HEK 293 cells transfected with the indicated construct were seeded onto glass coverslips and examined 1 day later. In co-expression experiments, fluorescent protein-tagged constructs were detected with a band pass filter (475-525 nm) using the 458-nm (for CFP, at 30-45% input power) or 488 nm (for YFP, at 8-10% input power) laser lines. Plasma membranes were visualized after the addition of 20 μl of trypan blue (0.05% (w/v) in PBS) at an excitation wavelength of 543 nm with a long pass filter (585 nm). CFP and trypan blue images were captured sequentially, and overlay images were produced with Zeiss imaging software as described (32Korkhov V.M. Holy M. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13439-13448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the DAT, residue Cys306, located at the end of EL3 between TM5 and TM6, has been shown to be essential for intermolecular disulfide bond formation upon oxidative treatment (5Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison revealed that in the GlyTs, leucine and threonine residues are found at the homologous positions (Leu343 in GlyT1c and Thr464 in GlyT2; Fig. 1A). To assess whether these residues reside at the surfaces of the respective transporter proteins and might be close to a possible dimerization interface, we generated a model of GlyT2 by using the crystal structure of LeuTAa as a template (13Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Regions that did not display significant homology to the LeuTAa protein, like the intracellular N and C termini and the large EL2 between TM3 and TM4, were deleted from the GlyT2 sequence to optimize sequence alignment. The resulting GlyT2 model showed a root mean square deviation of 3.62 Å from the LeuTAa structure when 498 of 504 pairwise Cα atoms were aligned (root mean square deviation of 1.157 Å for 398 Cα atoms). In this model, the side chain of Thr464 was located on the surface of the transporter above the helix formed by TM11 (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, Thr464 might be close to a possible dimerization interface. Apposition of two monomers at this interface created a GlyT2 dimer, in which the two Thr464 residues are in close proximity (Fig. 1, B-E). This dimeric model suggests that, in addition to interactions between the EL3 regions of the monomers, side chains of TM11 could contribute to dimer stabilization. Like-wise, in a similar model of GlyT1, Leu343, the amino acid residue corresponding to Thr464 in GlyT2 and Cys306 in DAT, is predicted to be localized at the surface of the transporter protein (data not shown). To establish whether Thr464 is indeed located at a dimerization interface of GlyT2, we replaced this residue by a cysteine in order to examine whether GlyT2 oligomers can be stabilized by intermolecular disulfide cross-linking, as reported for the DAT (5Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As controls, we generated two GlyT2 expression constructs, in which residues Lys462 and Thr557 were substituted by cysteines. According to our model, both residues are unlikely to face the proposed dimerization interface (Fig. 1, B-E). HEK 293T cells were transfected with these three cysteine-substituted GlyT2 constructs and analyzed for [3H]glycine uptake activity and subcellular localization of GlyT2 immunoreactivity. This did not reveal any significant differences as compared with wild-type GlyT2 (GlyT2WT; data not shown). Western blot analysis of detergent extracts prepared from the transfected cells confirmed that the mutant transporters were expressed in amounts comparable with that obtained with the GlyT2WT cDNA (Fig. 2C). Two bands of 65 and 90 kDa, which represent the core-glycosylated and fully glycosylated transporter forms (33Nunez E. Aragon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16920-16924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were seen with all three mutant proteins. An additional band at about 155 kDa present in variable amounts presumably corresponded to SDS-resistant dimers of immature transporter polypeptides (14Horiuchi M. Nicke A. Gomeza J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that none of the cysteine substitutions introduced affected the expression, function, or plasma membrane insertion of GlyT2 in HEK 293T cells. The GlyT2T464C Mutant Efficiently Forms Dimers—To determine whether position Thr464 is close to a potential dimerization interface of GlyT2, HEK 293T cells transiently expressing GlyT2WT, the GlyT2T464C mutant, or, as a control, DATWT were treated with the oxidizing agent CuP, followed by detergent extraction, nonreducing SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis. With DATWT-expressing cells, CuP treatment resulted in the appearance of a distinct band at 170 kDa in addition to immunoreactive bands at 85 and 57 kDa (Fig. 2A), which represent the mature and immature monomeric forms of this transporter (5Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The 170 kDa band corresponds in size to the previously described DATWT dimer (5Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), thereby confirming a close proximity of the Cys306 residues at the dimer interface. Consistent with previous findings (5Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the formation of DAT dimers by CuP was completely abolished when Cys306 was replaced by an alanine (DATC306A; Fig. 2A). In contrast to these results obtained with DATWT, CuP treatment of cells expressing GlyT2WT did not result in the formation of SDS-resistant GlyT2 oligomers (Fig. 2B, left). However, CuP treatment of GlyT2T464C-expressing cells generated a major GlyT2-immunoreactive adduct of 200 kDa. This was accompanied by a strong decrease in the intensity of the 90 kDa band, which represents the fully glycosylated GlyT2 monomer (Fig. 2B, left). These results are consistent with GlyT2T464C forming a dimer that is cross-linked upon oxidative treatment. To exclude the possibility that this 200-kDa adduct represents an unspecific aggregate induced by CuP treatment, detergent extracts from CuP-treated cells expressing GlyT2T464C were supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol. This reducing treatment resulted in a strong reduction of the 200 kDa band and an increase in the intensity of the mature monomer band at 90 kDa indicative of cleavage of the disulfide cross-link (Fig. 2B, right). Notably, in contrast to what was found with GlyT2T464C, CuP treatment of GlyT2T557C- or GlyT2K462C-expressing cells failed to produce the 200-kDa GlyT2 immunoreactive adduct (Fig. 2C). Thus, disulfide-mediated cross-linking of the GlyT2T464C mutant is position-specific. The functional consequences of CuP cross-linking were analyzed by measuring glycine-induced currents by two-electrode voltage clamp in Xenopus oocytes expressing His-GlyT2WT or His-GlyT2T464C before and after treatment with CuP. Application of 30 μm glycine induced currents of 76 ± 8 pA for GlyT2WT and 39 ± 5 pA for GlyT2T464C (n = 6). The smaller current monitored for the GlyT2T464C mutant most likely reflects a slightly reduced expression also seen in Western blots prepared from detergent extracts from the oocytes (data not shown). After treatment with CuP, the currents recorded from the same oocytes were not significantly reduced as compared with the currents measured before cross-linking (reduction of 18 ± 13% for His-GlyT2WT and of 15 ± 12% for His-GlyT2T464C, as compared with the untreated controls; p ≥ 0.5). Similar to what was seen in HEK 293T cells, treatment of His-GlyT2T464C but not His-GlyT2WT-expressing oocytes with CuP resulted in the appearance of a prominent GlyT2-immunoreactive band at 200 kDa (data not shown). Together, these results are consistent with cross-linking of GlyT2 dimers by CuP treatment not interfering with transporter function. Very similar findings were also obtained with GlyT1. CuP treatment of GlyT1WT stably expressing cells did not result in the appearance of a immunoreactive band of higher molecular weight. However, treatment of a GlyT1L343C-expressing cell line produced a prominent immunoreactive band at"

We expressed the three N-terminal complement control protein modules of human factor H (FH1-3) and confirmed FH1-3 to be the minimal unit with cofactor activity for C3b proteolysis by factor I. We reconstructed FH1-3 from NMR-derived structures of FH1-2 and FH2-3 revealing an ∼105-Å-long rod-like arrangement of the modules. In structural comparisons with other C3b-engaging proteins, factor H module 3 most closely resembles factor B module 3, consistent with factor H competing with factor B for binding C3b. Factor H modules 1, 2, and 3 each has a similar backbone structure to first, second, and third modules, respectively, of functional sites in decay accelerating factor and complement receptor type 1; the equivalent intermodular tilt and twist angles are also broadly similar. Resemblance between molecular surfaces is closest for first modules but absent in the case of second modules. Substitution of buried Val-62 with Ile (a factor H single nucleotide polymorphism potentially protective for age-related macular degeneration and dense deposit disease) causes rearrangements within the module 1 core and increases thermal stability but does not disturb the interface with module 2. Replacement of partially exposed (in module 1) Arg-53 by His (an atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome-linked mutation) did not impair structural integrity at 37 °C, but this FH1-2 mutant was less stable at higher temperatures; furthermore, chemical shift differences indicated potential for small structural changes at the module 1-2 interface.

It regulates the alternative pathway (AP) of activation of the complement system, a key molecular component of immune defense. Sequence variations in FH have been linked to three complement-mediated diseases; dense deposit disease (DDD, or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (2Abrera-Abeleda M.A. Nishimura C.

Activation of the complement system via either the alternative or classical pathways involves a proteolytic cascade (8Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar, 9Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). During this process complement components are enzymatically cleaved into active forms and surface-deposited. Deposition subsequently triggers destruction and immune clearance and is accompanied by release of pro-inflammatory anaphylatoxins. The AP of complement is permanently switched on; if left unchecked, a positive-feedback loop amplifies deposition of activated components onto any nearby surface. Factor H controls amplification via the AP both in fluid phase and selectively on self-surfaces (10Meri S. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3982-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 11Pangburn M.K. Pangburn K.L. Koistinen V. Meri S. Sharma A.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4742-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), thereby helping to direct complement toward its target, foreign or unwanted cells or particles. The remaining RCA family members are membrane proteins (CR1, DAF, and MCP) or act primarily on the classical pathway of complement (C4BP). Like the other RCA proteins, FH intervenes at the level of enzymatically active bi- and trimolecular complexes called the C3 and C5 convertases (C3b,Bb and C3b2,Bb, respectively, in the AP). These assemble on surfaces during the activation process and drive the proteolytic cascade by cleaving C3 and C5 into active fragments. Via unknown mechanisms, FH competes with factor B (FB) for binding to C3b, accelerates the irreversible decay of the convertases into their components (C3b and Bb), and acts as a cofactor for the factor I (FI)-mediated cleavage of C3b. The 20 homologous domains that make up the whole of FH, known as complement control protein modules (CCPs), are each ∼60 amino acid residues in length and stabilized by conserved disulfide bonds (1Ripoche J. Day A.J. Harris T.J. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 12Kristensen T. Tack B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Neighboring CCPs are linked by sequences containing between three and eight residues (13Soares D.C. Barlow P.N. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. Structural Biology of the Complement System. CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton. FL2005: 19-62Google Scholar). Low-resolution structural studies suggest a “beads-on-a-string” arrangement of CCPs within an elongated FH molecule that may bend back on itself (14Perkins S.J. Gilbert H.E. Aslam M. Hannan J. Holers V.M. Goodship T.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Within FH, C3b-binding sites have been mapped to CCPs 1-4 and CCPs 19-20 (15Hellwage J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A third C3b-binding site was inferred to occupy CCPs 12-14 (17Sharma A.K. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The C-terminal C3b-binding site additionally binds polyanions and acts as an anchor for attachment of FH to cell-surface bound C3b (19Blackmore T.K. Hellwage J. Sadlon T.A. Higgs N. Zipfel P.F.

The N-terminal C3b-binding site on the other hand is considered critical for engaging and disrupting convertases given that a recombinant protein consisting of FH modules 1-4 displays the full fluid-phase activity of FH and retains a capability to accelerate decay of cell-surface bound convertases (22Gordon D.L.

At least one single nucleotide polymorphism mapped to this region of FH has been linked to disease; V62I has been suggested to be protective against AMD and DDD (4Hageman G.S. Anderson D.H.

Moreover, a mutation of Arg-53 to His was discovered in a patient with aHUS (26Saunders R.E. Abarrategui-Garrido C. Fremeaux-Bacchi V. Goicoechea de Jorge E. Goodship T.H. Lopez Trascasa M. Noris M.

Each RCA family member has a distinct functional profile (27Kirkitadze M.D. Barlow P.N. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but the structural basis for complement regulation remains to be established. This is despite availability of experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of C4BPα CCPs 1-2 (28Jenkins H.T. Mark L. Ball G. Persson J. Lindahl G. Uhrin D. Blom A.M. Barlow P.N. J. Biol.

Ogata C.M. Kotwal G.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 301-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), all of which correspond to complete or partial functional sites within their respective parent proteins (Fig. 1). The N terminus of the principal soluble regulator of the AP, FH, therefore provides an attractive structural target. We report the production of a functionally active recombinant fragment of FH composed of CCPs 1-3 (FH1-3) together with the three-dimensional structure of FH1-3. We also report on the structural consequences of two disease-linked sequence variations in this region. Expression of Protein—The DNA fragments encoding human FH residues 20-142 for FH1-2, 84-206 for FH2-3, and 20-206 for FH1-3 (native sequence numbering, i.e. before cleavage of signal peptide) were cloned into Pichia pastoris expression vector pPICZαΒ. These clones have a valine at position 62 and, for the purposes of this study, will be referred to as wild type. The coding region of FH1-2 in pPICZαΒ was mutated to the variants FH1-2(H53) and FH1-2(I62) using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The expressed proteins were directed to the secretory pathway by placing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor secretion sequence upstream from the coding sequence. FH like-1 (a splice variant containing modules 1-7) was cloned into an insect cell expression system and expressed and purified as described previously (33Alam M.N. Haque A. Sreedhar M. Pangburn M.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 293: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). After transformation into P. pastoris strain KM71H, protein was expressed and isotopically labeled in batches of 0.6 liters (initial volume) of cell culture using a fermentor. Samples of FH1-2 and FH2-3 were enriched with >98% 15N or with 13C and 15N by providing (15NH4)2SO4 as the sole nitrogen source and [13C]glucose, [13C]glycerol, and [13C]methanol as carbon sources as previously described (34Herbert A.P. Uhrin D. Lyon M. Pangburn M.K. Barlow P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16512-16520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Additionally, a 15N sample of FH1-3 was enriched with >75% 2H by using 95% D2O and 1% methanol-d4 in the growth medium. After an induction period of 4-6 days, cells were pelleted, supernatant was harvested and diluted 5-fold in the presence of 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the pH was adjusted to 4.0. Purification of all three constructs was achieved by cation-exchange chromatography (SP Sepharose Fast Flow™ Sigma-Aldrich) followed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Supelco Discovery® BIO Wide Pore C5 column, Supelco Inc., PA). The resulting peak fractions were lyophilized. N-terminal sequencing confirmed the identity of the protein constructs as well as the presence of an N-terminal cloning artifact, EAEAAG, left over from incomplete processing of the α-factor secretion signal by the aminodipeptidase Ste13. Mass spectrometry confirmed the predicted sequence and the expected oxidation state of all cysteines (as contributors to disulfide bonds). Yields of purified protein were in the region of 1 mg of protein per g of wet cells. Determination of Complement-regulating Activity—Cofactor activity was initially determined using an end point fluid-phase cofactor assay. Molar equivalent amounts (1 μm) of constructs FH1-2, FH2-3, and FH1-3 were added to 5 μg (1.8 μm) of purified complement C3b mixed with 2 μg (1.4 μm) of FI (both from Comptech) in a total volume of 15 μl. A negative control where no FH constructs were present was also included. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, SDS-containing sample buffer including the reducing agent dithiothreitol was added, and the reactions were then heat-inactivated. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE to detect the extent of proteolytic cleavage of C3b α-chain by FI. To obtain a semiquantitative estimation of FH1-3 activity, a concentration titration cofactor assay was performed using the above assay conditions on full-length FH and FH1-3 at a series of molar-equivalent concentrations in a total reaction volume of 15 μl and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The decay acceleration assay was performed on FH1-3, FH-like-1, and FH as previously described (20Ferreira V.P. Herbert A.P. Hocking H.G. Barlow P.N. Pangburn M.K. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6308-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Data Collection and Processing—The addition of free l-Arg and l-Glu was previously reported to increase long-term stability and solubility of concentrated protein NMR samples (35Golovanov A.P. Hautbergue G.M. Wilson S.A. Lian L.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8933-8939Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The present study utilized deuterated versions (l-Arg-d7 and l-Glu-d5) to prevent their signals dominating 13C,1H-resolved experiments. Standard suites of NMR spectra (36Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. 2nd Ed. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press Inc., San Diego2006Google Scholar) were acquired on Bruker AVANCE 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers using 5-mm triple-resonance probes. Data for resonance assignments were acquired at 37 °C on 1 mm 13C,15N FH1-2, 2 mm 13C,15N FH2-3, and 0.6 mm 2H,15N FH1-3 in 20 mm potassium phosphate, 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, 10% (v/v) D2O, 50 mm arginine-d7, 50 mm glutamate-d5 at pH 6.2. 15N-Edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC (NOESY-HSQC) (37Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn.

Muhandiram D.R. Yamazaki J.D. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 103: 197-201Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar) experiments were acquired at 800 MHz for FH1-2 and FH2-3 with mixing times of 100 ms. Steady-state (1H,15N) nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) (39Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) were measured at 600 and 800 MHz and were calculated from the ratio of the intensities of the cross-peaks in the reference spectra to those recorded with saturation of the 1H signal. Additionally, a 1H,15N-states time-proportional phase incrementation transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy spectrum (40Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar) with watergate was acquired for FH1-3 at 800 MHz. Subsequently, the FH1-2 and FH2-3 samples were aligned in 12 mg/ml Pseudomonas filamentous phage (Profos, Regensburg, Germany) for measurements of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs); buffer conditions were kept identical to those used for NOE measurement. The degree of alignment was monitored from the splitting of the 2H signal, 6.2 Hz for FH1-2 at 600 MHz and 7.1 Hz for FH2-3 measured at 800 MHz. 1DNH (41Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn.

Reson. 1999; 141: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) RDC couplings were measured for aligned and unaligned samples of FH1-2 and FH2-3. The RDCs from residues deemed flexible based on relaxation data criteria were not used in the structure calculations (44Tjandra N. Feller S.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12562-12566Crossref Scopus (663) Google Scholar). NMR data were processed using the Azara suite of programs provided by Wayne Boucher and the Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, UK. Maximum entropy reconstruction was used for the F1 and F2 dimensions of the three-dimensional experiments. The RDC data were analyzed using an in-house macro developed for the Collaborative Computing Project for the NMR community Analysis software (45Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D. Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). Relaxation data were analyzed using the rates analysis function provided in the Analysis software (45Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D. Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). Analysis of NMR relaxation data and scrutiny of FH1-2 and FH2-3 NOESY spectra provided no evidence of non-transient self-association. Resonance Assignment and Structure Calculation—Processed spectra were viewed, and nuclei were assigned using Analysis (45Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D. Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). For example, ∼96 and ∼98% of observable protons were assigned within FH1-2 and FH2-3, respectively. Resolved peaks in 15N NOESY and 13C NOESY spectra were picked, and where possible, the root resonances were assigned unambiguously. All proline residues were defined as trans based on chemical shift differences between Cβ and Cγ resonances (46Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and observation of appropriate strong NOE cross-peaks. A list of chemical shifts and a set of largely unassigned NOESY spectra were supplied as input for CYANA 2.1, an automated structure-calculation software (47Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). The disulfide linkages were inferred from the proximity and geometry of Cys side chains in an initial set of structure calculations using CYANA 2.1 that did not incorporate disulfide bonds. Hydrogen bonds were inferred on the basis of a series of 15N HSQC spectra recorded on lyophilized samples resuspended in 99.96% D2O (Sigma-Aldrich) over a time-course of 2 h with 15-min intervals. No significant difference in the protected amides signals was observed after 1 h. Hydrogen-bond derived distance constraints were then created for protected protons possessing a feasible proton-accepting partner, as judged from first-round structure calculations in CYANA 2.1. A seven-cycle routine of target function minimization was subsequently performed using the combined automated NOE assignment and structure determination module within CYANA 2.1. The upper-limit distance constraints, 2722 for FH1-2 and 2733 for FH2-3, generated from CYANA 2.1 were converted to the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) format (48Brunger A.T. Adams P.D.

Ionides J. Laue E.D. Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). These constraints were incorporated into a final round of structure calculations, performed using CNS, during which the RDC constraints, 91 for FH1-2 and 169 for FH2-3, were incorporated into the final stages of refinement by including a TENSO energy term (49Sass H.J. Musco G. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Grzesiek S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with a harmonic potential. A lack of NOE or RDC violations and the low root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for backbone atoms (Table 1) confirmed the three-dimensional structure of each protein is well defined by experimental data.

https://openalex.org/W2024227138,"Alterations in signaling pathway activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a degenerative muscle disease caused by a deficiency in the costameric protein dystrophin. Accordingly, the notion of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, and by extension the costamere, as harboring signaling components has received increased attention in recent years. The localization of most, if not all, signaling enzymes to this subcellular region relies on interactions with scaffolding proteins directly or indirectly associated with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. One of these scaffolds is myospryn, a large, muscle-specific protein kinase A (PKA) anchoring protein or AKAP. Previous studies have demonstrated a dysregulation of myospryn expression in human Duchenne muscular dystrophy, suggesting a connection to the pathophysiology of the disorder. Here we report that dystrophic muscle exhibits reduced PKA activity resulting, in part, from severely mislocalized myospryn and the type II regulatory subunit (RIIα) of PKA. Furthermore, we show that myospryn and dystrophin coimmunoprecipitate in native muscle extracts and directly interact in vitro. Our findings reveal for the first time abnormalities in the PKA signal transduction pathway and myospryn regulation in dystrophin deficiency.

It is undisputed that defects within the DGC are one of the major triggers of muscular dystrophy, yet the mechanisms by which a defective DGC leads to muscle degeneration remain unclear. Hence, intense efforts have been put forth to molecularly dissect the function of dystrophin as well as the DGC (5Sweeney H.L. Barton E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dystrophin serves as a scaffold for numerous protein-protein interactions with components of the DGC as well as non-DGC proteins at the level of the costamere (7Ervasti J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13591-13594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The prevailing model suggests a structural and mechanical role for dystrophin (9Judge L.M. Haraguchiln M. Chamberlain J.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1537-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but an additional function in signaling has been proposed (10Lapidos K.A. Kakkar R. McNally E.M. Circ.

Although elucidating the role of dystrophin in signaling has been a challenging task, there is evidence of altered signaling activity in muscular dystrophies. Alterations in calcium levels and the neuronal nitric oxide synthase pathway in DMD have been known for some time (12Batchelor C.L. Winder S.J.

Perturbations in the activity of additional signaling molecules such as calcineurin, Akt, JNK1, and IκB kinase/NF-κB have been linked to muscular dystrophies (15Chakkalakal J.V.

Investig. 2007; 117: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the costameric protein myospryn functions as a muscle-specific protein kinase A (PKA) anchoring protein or AKAP (20Reynolds J.G. McCalmon S.A. Tomczyk T. Naya F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This was the first demonstration of myospryn coordinating the PKA signaling pathway at the level of the costamere. The AKAP family of scaffolding proteins is found in every cell type, and since PKA is a ubiquitous, diffusible enzyme, substrate specificity is achieved by localizing the activity of the enzyme within discrete subcellular compartments through the anchoring function of AKAPs (21Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of myospryn to anchor PKA at the costamere may have profound regulatory implications given that dystrophin has been shown to be phosphorylated by PKA (22Senter L. Ceoldo S. Petrusa M.M. Salviati G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Michalak M. Fu S.Y. Milner R.E. Busaan J.L. Hance J.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A potential consequence of these associations in muscle disease is implied by the observation that myospryn transcripts are reduced in human DMD (24Tkatchenko A.V. Pietu G. Cros N. Gannoun-Zaki L. Auffray C. Leger J.J. Dechesne C.A. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2001; 11: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Regarding PKA signaling, it now appears that myospryn is one of a growing number of muscle proteins within the costamere that have the ability to anchor PKA. Two recent reports have described an association between PKA and dystrobrevin and synemin, respectively (25Ceccarini M. Grasso M. Veroni C. Gambara G. Artegiani B. Macchia G. Ramoni C. Torreri P. Mallozzi C. Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 1174-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Russell M.A. Lund L.M. Haber R. McKeegan K. Cianciola N. Bond M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 456: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of PKA anchoring at the level of the costamere and the DGC points to a potential novel role for this conserved signaling pathway in regulating costameric function. Using the mdx mouse model of DMD, we demonstrate for the first time that PKA activity is significantly reduced in dystrophic muscle. We also report that myospryn and the RIIα regulatory subunit of PKA are mislocalized in mdx muscle from their normal location at the costamere, providing some insight into a possible mechanism of altered PKA activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dystrophin and myospryn coimmunoprecipitate from native muscle extracts in vivo and directly interact in vitro. Therefore, our results suggest that misregulated myospryn expression along with impaired PKA activity and localization in dystrophin-deficient muscle contribute to the pathogenesis of DMD. Plasmids—Dystrophin/Dp71 (amino acids 3028–3679) (27Crawford G.E. Faulkner J.A. Crosbie R.H. Campbell K.P. Froehner S.C. Chamberlain J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1399-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) was cloned in pcDNA3.1-FLAG vector. Myc-myospryn constructs were described previously (20Reynolds J.G. McCalmon S.A. Tomczyk T. Naya F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The TRIM domain of myospryn (Spe) (28Durham J.T. Brand O.M. Arnold M. Reynolds J.G.

Cell Culture and coIP—COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine. COS cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus), and coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) assays were performed as described elsewhere (20Reynolds J.G. McCalmon S.A. Tomczyk T. Naya F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Immunoblots—Proteins were fractionated, transferred onto Immun-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and immunoblotted with primary antibodies anti-FLAG (Sigma) or c-Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and reacted with Western Lightning chemiluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For myospryn analysis in wild type and mdx muscle, extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, electroblotted, and probed with anti-myospryn antibodies at 1:2,000 (28Durham J.T. Brand O.M.

For endogenous immunoprecipitations, adult mouse hind limb muscle was homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Extracts were incubated with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) and either anti-GAL4 or anti-myospryn antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated protein extracts were fractionated and immunoblotted with anti-dystrophin antibody (Sigma). GST Pulldown Assays—GST and GST-Spe proteins expressed in Escherichia coli (DH5α) were preincubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) followed by the addition of FLAG-Dp71 for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Washed beads were resuspended, fractionated, and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG to detect Dp71. Immunohistochemistry—Hind limb muscle sections from adult wild type and mdx (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor) mice were prepared as before (20Reynolds J.G. McCalmon S.A. Tomczyk T. Naya F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PKA-RII immunodetection was carried out as described previously (20Reynolds J.G. McCalmon S.A. Tomczyk T. Naya F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All other primary antibodies were diluted 1:100 in blocking solution (3% normal horse serum in 1× phosphate-buffered saline) incubated for 1 h, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline followed by secondary antibodies diluted at 1:200: chicken anti-goat FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for anti-PKA RII and horse antimouse Texas Red (Vector Laboratories) for vinculin. Primary rabbit polyclonal anti-myospryn antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-dystrophin antibodies (Sigma), and mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibodies (Sigma) were diluted 1:100 and incubated as above. Slides were washed, and secondary antibodies were applied for co-localization: goat anti-rabbit Texas Red (Vector Laboratories) and horse anti-mouse-FITC (Vector Laboratories) for myospryn/dystrophin or goat anti-rabbit FITC (Vector Laboratories) and horse anti-mouse Texas red for myospryn/vinculin. Real-time PCR—Pooled equimolar cDNA samples were prepared from 3–6-month-old wild type and mdx hind limb muscle. PCR was performed using the SYBR® Green PCR master mix and the ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Primers used were as follows: Gravin, 5′GCTGAGTCCCAAGCTAATGAC-3′, 5-GGACGGTATCTGACTTTTCGTT-3′ (PBID 13626040a2); Akap-Lbc, 5′-GAGTCTGTCTGCCGATTCAAA-3′,5′-GCTGATTACAATGGAGTGCCTC-3′ (PBID 14192799a3); Akap15, 5′-CACCAACAAAAAGGCCCAAA, 5′-TGAGCTGTCATTGGATCCCTG3′; makap, 5′-TTGCGTCTCACAAAGCAGGA-3′,5′-TCTGAGAATCCAGCTGTGTTGC-3′; Akap79/150, 5′-AGAACCCAGTAATGGCATCCG-3′,5′-TCTTTCAGATCTTCTGCCTGGC-3′; myospryn, 5′-GACAAGGGGAGACCTCATGGT-3′, 5′-GGTTGGTATAGTCCAGCAGAATG-3′; gapdh, 5′-TGGCAAAGTGGAGATTGTTGCC-3′,5′-AAGATGGTGATGGGCTTCCCG-3′. Primers with PBID designation were obtained from the Primer Bank web site (29Wang X. Seed B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e154Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). PKA Activity Assay—Three-month-old adult wild type and mdx hind limb muscle were homogenized in Tris buffer. Protein extracts were subjected to a commercially available PKA activity assay (Promega). Degradation and Mislocalization of Myospryn in mdx Muscle—Since myospryn is localized to the costamere, a structure destabilized in dystrophin deficiency, we asked whether myospryn expression and localization are affected in dystrophic muscle. Immunoblot analysis revealed a significant 73% decrease (p < 0.03) in full-length myospryn protein in mdx hind limb muscle (Fig. 1A, arrows and right panel). This decrease was associated with an accumulation of smaller fragments in mdx but not in wild type extracts (Fig. 1A, asterisks). These smaller myosprynimmunoreactive bands suggest that myospryn is a specific target of increased protease activity, a cellular mechanism previously linked to muscular dystrophy (30Kramerova I. Beckmann J.S. Spencer M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 128-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Next, we sought to determine whether myospryn is mislocalized in this dystrophin-deficient model. As depicted in Fig. 1B, immunostaining of adult wild type hind limb muscle detected myospryn along the myofiber periphery (see WT-myospryn, upper middle panel) as previously published by our group and others (28Durham J.T. Brand O.M. Arnold M. Reynolds J.G. Muthukumar L. Weiler H. Richardson J.A. Naya F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6841-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Benson M.A. Tinsley C.L. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10450-10458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Kouloumenta A. Mavroidis M. Capetanaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35211-35221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In striking contrast, mdx muscle exhibited a discontinuous localization of myospryn at the myofiber periphery with extensive regions devoid of myospryn (Fig. 1B; compare WT-myospryn with mdx-myospryn and note the arrows in mdx-vinculin and mdx-myospryn). This highly irregular pattern was associated with an increase in myospryn in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B, asterisks), particularly in discrete foci within myofibers (see arrowheads; compare vinculin with myospryn in mdx). Vinculin, a representative costameric protein, was localized normally at the myofiber periphery in both wild type and mdx muscle (Fig. 1B). These results clearly demonstrate a specific and pronounced mislocalization of myospryn in dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle. Direct Interaction between Dystrophin and Myospryn—Given the above results and the previously reported biochemical fractionation assays demonstrating the presence of dystrophin and myospryn in microsomal fractions (31Benson M.A. Tinsley C.L. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10450-10458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we were prompted to test whether a dystrophin-myospryn complex exists in vivo. Adult mouse hind limb muscle extracts were subjected to an immunoprecipitation assay using anti-myospryn antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE fractionation and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, Western blot analysis revealed the presence of dystrophin in the anti-myospryn precipitated complex (arrowhead) but not in the anti-GAL4 complex, demonstrating the specificity of this association. Double label immunohistochemistry was subsequently performed on adult hind limb muscle, which revealed a co-localization of both proteins at the myofiber periphery (Fig. 2B) consistent with the immunoprecipitation results. To confirm the above observations, we tested whether myospryn and dystrophin can directly interact by GST pulldown assay. We generated a recombinant GST fusion protein consisting of the carboxyl-terminal TRIM region of myospryn (Spe). In addition, we constructed a carboxyl-terminal dystrophin expression construct known as Dp71, which harbors docking sites for dystrobrevin, syntrophin, and dystroglycan (27Crawford G.E. Faulkner J.A. Crosbie R.H. Campbell K.P. Froehner S.C. Chamberlain J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1399-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, myospryn (GST-Spe) effectively precipitated dystrophin (Dp71), whereas GST alone failed to do so. To begin to delineate the dystrophin interaction sites on myospryn, coIP assays were initiated. Co-transfection of Dp71 along with several myospryn deletion constructs in COS cells revealed that dystrophin interacts within at least two independent regions in the TRIM domain (Fig. 2D, left and right panels). Notably, these dystrophin interaction regions overlap with our previously reported RIIα anchoring sites (20Reynolds J.G. McCalmon S.A. Tomczyk T. Naya F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The specificity of the interaction between Dp71 and the myospryn TRIM region was confirmed by performing immunoprecipitations in the reverse direction using anti-FLAG antibodies (supplemental Fig. S1). Taken together, the above results demonstrate a novel, direct association between dystrophin and myospryn in striated muscle. Altered PKA Activity and Anchoring in mdx Hind Limb Muscle—Having previously established that myospryn functions as a muscle-specific AKAP and now finding that it is mislocalized and degraded in dystrophin deficiency, we evaluated the PKA signaling pathway in mdx muscle. Because myospryn specifically binds to the RIIα regulatory subunit of PKA, we performed immunohistochemistry on mdx hind limb muscle with anti-RII antibodies. We demonstrate that RIIα, which is normally present and co-localized with myospryn at the costamere (20Reynolds J.G. McCalmon S.A. Tomczyk T. Naya F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), is mislocalized in mdx muscle with considerably reduced staining at the sarcolemma (Fig. 3A, arrowheads). Moreover, a preponderance of cytoplasmic staining is evident in mdx but not wild type muscle (compare asterisks, WT-RIIα versus mdx-RIIα). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of deregulated PKA localization in muscular dystrophy and is consistent with the ability of myospryn to anchor the PKA holoenzyme. Because myospryn functions as an AKAP and because of our observation that the RIIα regulatory subunit is mislocalized, we asked whether PKA activity was altered in dystrophic muscle. It is known that PKA anchoring plays an important role in regulating PKA enzymatic activity (19Acharyya S. Villalta S.A. Bakkar N. Bupha-Intr T. Janssen P.M. Carathers M. Li Z.W. Beg A.A. Ghosh S. Sahenk Z. Weinstein M. Gardner K.L. Rafael-Fortney J.A. Karin M. Tidball J.G. Baldwin A.S. Guttridge D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein extracts from adult wild type (n = 3) and mdx (n = 3) hind limb muscle were subjected to a PKA activity assay. As shown in Fig. 3B, PKA activity is reduced by 50% (p < 0.003) in mdx muscle pointing to a significant alteration of the PKA signaling pathway in dystrophic muscle. Western analyses did not detect differences in expression of the catalytic or regulatory subunits of PKA in mdx muscle (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, cAMP assays failed to reveal differences in cAMP levels in mdx hind limb muscle (data not shown). These results indicate that the decrease in activity is the result of aberrant PKA anchoring and not due to reduced expression of the holoenzyme subunits or upstream alterations in the second messenger cAMP. Myospryn Is a Uniquely Down-regulated AKAP in mdx Muscle—Previously published data revealed down-regulated myospryn gene expression in human DMD muscle biopsies (24Tkatchenko A.V. Pietu G. Cros N. Gannoun-Zaki L. Auffray C. Leger J.J. Dechesne C.A. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2001; 11: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine whether myospryn gene expression is also reduced in mdx muscle, we performed quantitative RT-PCR between pooled wild type (n = 3) and mdx (n = 3) hind limb muscle cDNAs. Our results revealed a 40% decrease in myospryn transcripts in mdx muscle (Fig. 3D) consistent with the finding in DMD. We then asked whether this effect on myospryn transcription reflects a more global phenomenon of reduced AKAP gene expression in dystrophic muscle. By performing quantitative RT-PCR on five well characterized AKAPs, mAKAP, AKAPLbc, AKAP15, gravin, and AKAP79/150, we found that myospryn is the only AKAP down-regulated in mdx hind limb muscle (Fig. 3D). These results reinforce the notion that the down-regulation of myospryn is highly specific and not the result of a global reduction in AKAP gene expression in dystrophic muscle. Myospryn Is Regulated by the PKA-CREB Signaling Pathway—Given the specific reduction of myospryn gene expression in both DMD and mdx muscle and our new finding of reduced PKA activity, we asked whether this down-regulation may be the consequence of altered PKA signaling. Thus, we scanned the myospryn promoter for potential cAMP-response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) binding sites. CREB is one of the major effectors of PKA signaling (33Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). We found a CRE, TAACGTTA, located at –220 bp upstream of the myospryn transcription start site. The importance of this CRE site was tested by co-transfecting COS cells with a luciferase reporter construct containing 0.8 kb of the myospryn promoter along with CREB plus constitutively active PKA. As depicted in Fig. 3E, luciferase assays revealed a 17.8 ± 4.4-fold activation (p < 0.01) over myospryn promoter alone. The transcriptional activation occurred specifically through the CRE in the myospryn promoter since a mutation within the CRE site (TCCCGGGA) resulted in a 90% reduction (2.0 ± 0.26-fold activation; p < 0.01) of PKA-CREB dependent activation. These results demonstrate that myospryn is a novel target gene downstream of the PKA-CREB signal transduction pathway. Thus, reduced myospryn gene expression in dystrophin-deficient muscle may also contribute to reduced PKA activity by having less available anchoring protein at the costamere. To gain a better understanding of the potential broader involvement of the PKA-CREB signaling pathway in muscular dystrophy, we performed a comparative analysis between genes dysregulated in mdx muscle (Refs. 35Chen Y.W. Zhao P. Borup R. Hoffman E.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1321-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar and 36Haslett J.N. Sanoudou D. Kho A.T. Bennett R. R Greenberg S.A. Kohane I.S. Beggs A.H. Kunkel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15000-15005Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar and supplemental Refs. 38–41) and known CREB targets (Refs. 33Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar and 37Berdeaux R. Goebel N. Banaszynski L. Takemori H. Wandless T. Shelton G.D. Montminy M. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar and supplemental Ref. 42). As seen in supplemental Table S1, there are nearly two dozen genes dysregulated in mdx muscle that function downstream of CREB. All of these genes are cAMPregulated, reinforcing the notion that the PKA signal transduction pathway is defective in dystrophin-deficient muscle. The results of our study uncover a novel defect in the PKA signal transduction pathway in the mdx mouse model of dystrophin deficiency. The perturbation in this signaling cascade is consistent with reduced expression of the AKAP myospryn and the mislocalization of its gene product and the regulatory subunit of PKA. The intricate costameric network is believed to be responsible for maintaining the integrity and stability of the muscle cell membrane. The absence of dystrophin, members of the DGC, and possibly other costameric proteins triggers a series of cellular and molecular events resulting in muscle degeneration, thereby establishing this region as a critical support system in proper muscle function. Because of the multitude of scaffolding proteins within the costamere, signaling components are likely to be key participants in the pathogenesis of muscle disease. As such, the role of signaling pathways in muscular dystrophy has received increased attention in recent years (10Lapidos K.A. Kakkar R. McNally E.M. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 11Rando T.A. Muscle Nerve. 2001; 24: 1575-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 12Batchelor C.L. Winder S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 198-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the muscle-specific AKAP myospryn is degraded and mislocalized from the costamere in mdx hind limb muscle consistent with our finding that myospryn and dystrophin physically interact. This is a significant finding given that the predominant costameric components affected in dystrophin deficiency are those proteins directly associated with the DGC (1Dalkilic I. Kunkel L.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 2Davies K.E. Nowak K.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 3Durbeej M. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 4Heydemann A. McNally E.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2007; 17: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, myospryn represents one of a limited number of non-DGC costameric proteins impaired in dystrophin deficiency. It is worth noting that the cumulative intensities of the degradation products of myospryn in mdx muscle appear equal to or greater than the intensity of full-length myospryn in wild type tissue. This contrasts with reduced myospryn transcripts in mdx muscle. One interpretation for this apparent discrepancy is that myospryn protein is indeed reduced and that the observed increase in signal intensity is the result of enhanced immunoreactivity of these smaller polypeptides toward the antibody. Alternatively, these collective signal intensities may reflect actual protein levels. In this case, the lack of correlation between transcripts and protein could be explained by the stability and low turnover of myospryn fragments. Regardless of the mechanism, full-length myospryn is clearly diminished in mdx muscle. Consistent with the ability of myospryn to bind PKA, we find that the RIIα regulatory subunit is mislocalized from the costamere. Accordingly, we see a substantial reduction in PKA activity in mdx muscle. This is the first, direct demonstration of deregulated PKA activity in dystrophic muscle. It is worth noting that a previous study revealed altered activity of the l-type Ca2+ channel, whose function is regulated by PKA, in mdx muscle (34Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4191-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, our findings provide a potential molecular explanation for these observations. This global reduction of PKA activity in dystrophic muscle is also likely to affect numerous downstream PKA-dependent pathways such as its ability to regulate gene expression. Intriguingly, we observed a reduction in myospryn gene expression in mdx muscle, which prompted us to examine the potential regulation of myospryn expression through one of the major PKA substrates, the CREB transcription factor. Indeed, we detected a robust and specific activation of myospryn through PKACREB signaling. Taken together, our findings suggest that perturbation of myospryn expression and localization may, in part, be responsible for the altered PKA activity in dystrophic muscle. These studies highlight the importance of tightly regulating myospryn expression in striated muscle. Of note, the major classes of genes regulated by the PKACREB pathway are those involved in cellular metabolism, cell survival, and proliferation (33Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). Incidentally, the gene expression profiles in dystrophin-deficient muscle underscore the molecular hallmarks of dystrophy such as muscle cell death, the inability to regenerate muscle effectively, and altered metabolic activity (35Chen Y.W. Zhao P. Borup R. Hoffman E.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1321-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 36Haslett J.N. Sanoudou D. Kho A.T. Bennett R. R Greenberg S.A. Kohane I.S. Beggs A.H. Kunkel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15000-15005Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 38–41). Therefore, it is formally possible that these defects arise from the deregulation of PKA signaling observed in mdx muscle. It is also worth noting that a recent report described a muscular dystrophy phenotype in transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant negative CREB in skeletal muscle (37Berdeaux R. Goebel N. Banaszynski L. Takemori H. Wandless T. Shelton G.D. Montminy M. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2079099340,"The inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2 is the pore-forming subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, which controls insulin secretion by coupling glucose metabolism to membrane potential in beta-cells. Loss of channel function because of mutations in Kir6.2 or its associated regulatory subunit, sulfonylurea receptor 1, causes congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), a neonatal disease characterized by persistent insulin secretion despite severe hypoglycemia. Here, we report a novel K(ATP) channel gating defect caused by CHI-associated Kir6.2 mutations at arginine 301 (to cysteine, glycine, histidine, or proline). These mutations in addition to reducing channel expression at the cell surface also cause rapid, spontaneous current decay, a gating defect we refer to as inactivation. Based on the crystal structures of Kir3.1 and KirBac1.1, Arg-301 interacts with several residues in the neighboring Kir6.2 subunit. Mutation of a subset of these residues also induces channel inactivation, suggesting that the disease mutations may cause inactivation by disrupting subunit-subunit interactions. To evaluate the effect of channel inactivation on beta-cell function, we expressed an alternative inactivation mutant R301A, which has equivalent surface expression efficiency as wild type channels, in the insulin-secreting cell line INS-1. Mutant expression resulted in more depolarized membrane potential and elevated insulin secretion at basal glucose concentration (3 mm) compared with cells expressing wild type channels, demonstrating that the inactivation gating defect itself is sufficient to cause loss of channel function and hyperinsulinism. Our studies suggest the importance of Kir6.2 subunit-subunit interactions in K(ATP) channel gating and function and reveal a novel gating defect underlying CHI."
https://openalex.org/W1995781008,"Selectin-ligand interactions (bonds) mediate leukocyte rolling on vascular surfaces. The molecular basis for differential ligand recognition by selectins is poorly understood. Here, we show that substituting one residue (A108H) in the lectin domain of L-selectin increased its force-free affinity for a glycosulfopeptide binding site (2-GSP-6) on P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) but not for a sulfated-glycan binding site (6-sulfo-sialyl Lewis x) on peripheral node addressin. The increased affinity of L-selectinA108H for 2-GSP-6 was due to a faster on-rate and to a slower off-rate that increased bond lifetimes in the absence of force. Rather than first prolonging (catching) and then shortening (slipping) bond lifetimes, increasing force monotonically shortened lifetimes of L-selectinA108H bonds with 2-GSP-6. When compared with microspheres bearing L-selectin, L-selectinA108H microspheres rolled more slowly and regularly on 2-GSP-6 at low flow rates. A reciprocal substitution in P-selectin (H108A) caused faster microsphere rolling on 2-GSP-6. These results distinguish molecular mechanisms for L-selectin to bind to PSGL-1 and peripheral node addressin and explain in part the shorter lifetimes of PSGL-1 bonds with L-selectin than P-selectin."
https://openalex.org/W2029863283,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is involved in signal transduction by integrin-mediated cell adhesion that leads to dynamic actin reorganization. Actin (de)polymerization is regulated by cofilin, the Ser3 phosphorylation (pS3cofilin) of which inhibits its actin-severing activity. To determine how ILK regulates pS3cofilin, we examined the effects of ILK on pS3cofilin using normal RIE1 cells. Compared with suspended cells, fibronectin-adherent cells showed enhanced pS3cofilin, depending on ILK expression and c-Src activity. The ILK-mediated pS3cofilin in RIE1 cells did not involve Rho-associated kinase, LIM kinase, or testicular protein kinases, which are known to be upstream of cofilin. The kinase domain of ILK, including proline-rich regions, appeared to interact physically with the Src homology 3 domain of c-Src. In vitro kinase assay revealed that ILK immunoprecipitates phosphorylated the recombinant glutathione S-transferase-cofilin, which was abolished by c-Src inhibition. Interestingly, epidermal growth factor treatment abolished the ILK effects, indicating that the linkage from ILK to cofilin is biologically responsive to extracellular cues.

ILK is a Ser/Thr kinase located at focal adhesions by binding to the β1 integrin cytoplasmic tail, the overexpression of which inhibits intestinal epithelial cell adhesion to integrin substrates (8Hannigan G.E.

ILK expression was suppressed epigenetically upon adhesion of gastric carcinoma cells, and ILK overexpression reduced adhesion abilities and enhanced anchorage-independent growth (9Kim Y-B. Lee S.-Y. Ye S.-K. Lee J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C857-C866Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In contrast, ILK expression also correlated with an increased adhesion of prostate cancer cells (10Attwell S. Mills J. Troussard A. Wu C. Dedhar S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4813-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and ILK was transiently activated upon adhesion of intestinal epithelial cells to fibronectin (Fn) (11Delcommenne M. Tan C.

Although the roles of ILK in cell adhesion-mediated actin reorganization have thus been elucidated, depending on the cell type or signaling contexts, the mechanistic roles of ILK in the regulation of cofilin phosphorylation remain largely unknown. In this study, we revealed a new functional linkage of ILK to cofilin by showing that ILK-associated c-Src affected ILK activity to phosphorylate cofilin during normal RIE1 cell adhesion. Cells—The integrin α5-expressing normal rat intestinal epithelial cell line (RIE1-α5) was described previously (12Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1973-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cell Conditions, Treatments, and Immunoblots—Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid (see below) or with siRNAs against ILK (Dharmacon) or LIMK1 (Bioneer Corp., Daejeon, Korea) for 24 h using the Magnetofection™ system (polyMag, OZ Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocols, and/or cells were infected with control or ILK-encoding adenovirus (kind gifts from Dr. H.-S. Kim, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea) for 24 h. The plasmid used for transfection was pcDNA3 with ILK(WT), ILK(E359K), ILK(S343A), kinase-dead ROCK1 (DA-1A, a kind gift from Dr. S. Narumiya, Kyoto University, Japan), kinase-dead TESK1(D170A) or TESK2(D176A) (13Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol.

Juliano, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) via polymerase chain reactions (GeneAll, Seoul), and their sequences were confirmed by direct sequence analysis. The cells were then harvested or treated with Me2SO or pharmacological inhibitors for 30 min before being kept in suspension or replated on Fn (10 μg/ml; Chemicon)-precoated or polylysine (10 μg/ml; Sigma)-precoated dishes for 1 h. The inhibitors include LY294002 (20 μm; LC Laboratories), PP2 (10 μm; A.G. Scientific, Inc.), PP3 (10 μm; A.G. Scientific, Inc.), U0126 (40 μm; LC Laboratories), p18 peptide (5 μm; Calbiochem), and Y27632 (15 μm; Calbiochem). In some cases, EGF (50 ng/ml) was treated for the last 5 min of the replating time. Whole cell lysates were prepared using a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO4, 1 mm nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μm leupeptin) and used in immunoblotting with pY397FAK, pY416c-Src, ILK, and c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Akt, pS473Akt, Erk1/2, phospho-Erk1/2, pT508LIMK1, LIMK1, cofilin, and pS3cofilin (Cell Signaling Technology); FAK, GST, ROCK1, and α-tubulin (BD Transduction Laboratories); and phospho-Ser/Thr (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibodies. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells on Fn-precoated coverglasses were manipulated with or without pretreatment with 10 μm PP2 (a c-Src family kinase inhibitor) or treatment with EGF (50 ng/ml) as above or alternatively transfected with pEGFP-ILK. Immunofluorescence for ILK or pY416c-Src or staining of actin using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was performed using confocal (MRC-500, Bio-Rad) or fluorescent (BX51, Olympus) microscopy as described previously (15Lee M-S. Kim T.-Y. Kim Y.-B. Lee S.-Y. Ko S.-G. Jong H.-S. Kim T.-Y. Bang Y.-J. Lee J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6921-6936Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation—Cells were transfected with inactive c-Src(Y416F) or kinase-dead ROCK1 (KD-1A) for 48 h. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-ILK antibody as described previously (15Lee M-S. Kim T.-Y. Kim Y.-B. Lee S.-Y. Ko S.-G. Jong H.-S. Kim T.-Y. Bang Y.-J. Lee J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6921-6936Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and probed for c-Src or ILK by immunoblotting. Expression of Fusion Proteins and in Vitro Pulldown Assay—Diverse human ILK (NP_004508) gene constructs were prepared and cloned into the pGEX4T-3 vector (GE Healthcare) at EcoRI and XhoI cloning sites. Their sequences were directly confirmed. Each construct, GST-cofilin (a kind gift from Dr. T. Nakamura, Osaka University) or GST-c-Src in Escherichia coli BL21, was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. The E. coli extracts (with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm Na2S2O5, 10% glycerol, 20% sucrose, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na2VO4, and protease inhibitors) were then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 6 h at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins bound to beads were washed once with the extracting buffer and three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and mixed with RIE1-α5 cell extracts (1 mg of protein/condition) for 4 h at 4 °C with or without 10 μm PP2 treatment. After washings as above, proteins were eluted via the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Eluted proteins were resolved, transferred, and immunoblotted for anti-ILK, anti-GST, or anti-c-Src antibody. In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro ILK kinase assay was performed as described previously (16Oh M.-A. Kang E.-S. Lee S.-A. Lee E.-O. Kim Y.-B. Kim S.-H. Lee J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2717-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). ILK immunoprecipitates were prepared overnight using whole cell extracts, mixed with protein A/G beads (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C, and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. An equal amount of ILK immunoprecipitates was then incubated with myelin basic protein (MBP) (3 μg/condition; Sigma) or recombinant GST-cofilin (3 μg/condition) for 30 min at 25 °C in the reaction buffer including 2 μm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm NaF. The reactions were stopped with the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and they were then used in immunoblotting for the indicated molecules or Ponceau S staining for MBP. Statistical Analysis—The relative pS3cofilin under diverse experimental conditions was calculated for graphic presentation (mean ± S.D.) or for -fold difference presentation (with raising fractions not lower than 0.05-0.1 for a concise representation) after the normalization of pS3cofilin over cofilin band intensities as measured by densitometry. Student's t test was performed for comparison of mean values to see if the difference was significant. p < 0.05 was considered significant. ILK-mediated Cofilin Phosphorylation upon Cell Adhesion—Although ILK and cofilin are both known to be involved in actin organization, their functional linkage remains largely unknown. While investigating integrin-mediated actin organization, we found that RIE1-α5 cells replated on Fn showed a higher pS3cofilin than suspended cells did, and exogenous overexpression of ILK further enhanced the adhesion-dependent pS3cofilin (Fig. 1A). In contrast, cells held in suspension, adherent on polylysine, or in a normal serum-containing condition showed no significant pS3cofilin even upon ILK overexpression (Fig. 1A). Over time, after being suspended or replated on polylysine, pS3colofin was not observed or was minor, respectively, whereas cells adherent on Fn showed significant pS3cofilin levels when ILK was overexpressed. The ILK-enhanced pS3cofilin was not correlated with the activities of FAK, Akt, or GSK3β (Fig. 1A and data not shown), which are downstream of integrins or of ILK (17Legate K.R. Montanez E. Kudlacek O. Fassler R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar); they did not show adhesion dependence and/or ILK overexpression dependence, unlike pS3cofilin levels in Fn-adherent cells overexpressing ILK. However, Tyr118-phosphorylated paxillin was enhanced by cell adhesion, although exogenous ILK did not additionally enhance it (Fig. 1A). The ILK(E359K) mutant, which is paxillin and parvin binding-deficient (18Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1568-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and putatively kinase-dead with residual kinase activity (19Boulter E. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), did not alter the ILK-enhanced pS3cofilin, whereas the ILK(S343A) mutant with abolished kinase activity (20Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) reduced the ILK effects (Fig. 1C). However, cell adhesion-dependent pY397FAK was not altered by the expression of different ILK constructs, indicating again that the active ILK could enhance pS3cofilin in a FAK-independent manner (Fig. 1C). Consistent with actin polymerization supported by Ser3-phosphorylated cofilin (7Huang T.Y. DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the green fluorescent protein-ILK transfected cells formed more stress fibers compared with neighboring untransfected cells (Fig. 1D). ILK-mediated pS3cofilin Depends on c-Src Activity—Next we examined the molecular basis of the ILK effects on cell adhesion. To address this, ILK-infected cells were suspended or replated on Fn for 1 h with or without pretreatment with diverse pharmacological inhibitors. Pretreatment with inhibitors including LY294002 (a specific inhibitor against phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and thus its downstream Akt), PP2 (a selective c-Src family kinase inhibitor), U0126 (a specific inhibitor against mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MEKs) and thus downstream Erk1/2), p18 peptide (a selective myosin light-chain kinase inhibitor), or Y27632 (a selective ROCK inhibitor) had been done 30 min before cells were held in suspension or replated on Fn. Immunoblots of whole cell lysates from these treatments showed that inhibition of c-Src or ROCK (Fig. 2A) abolished the ILK-enhanced pS3cofilin. Furthermore, pS3cofilin levels in Fn-adherent cells with diverse treatments were correlated with pY416c-Src levels, but not with pY397FAK or pS473Akt levels (Fig. 2A). Therefore, these data indicate that c-Src activity might be important for pS3cofilin in the RIE1-α5 cells. Although it is known that ROCK1 phosphorylates LIMKs, which in turn phosphorylate cofilin (21Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 22Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), pT508LIMK1 levels under these treatments were not correlated with the pS3cofilin levels (Fig. 2A). Suppression of LIMK1 by its siRNA transfection nearly abolished the adhesion-mediated pS3cofilin in control virus-infected cells, but not in ILK overexpression-enhanced pS3cofilin of Fn-adherent cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that LIMK1 does not play a significant role in the ILK overexpression-enhanced pS3cofilin. When kinase-dead ROCK1 (KD-1A) was expressed, the basal cell adhesion-dependent pS3cofilin was completely abolished, but ILK overexpression-mediated pS3cofilin was still significantly maintained (Fig. 2C), indicating that ILK overexpression-mediated pS3cofilin might be independent in part of ROCK1. However, the siRNA against ILK completely abolished the ILK effects (Fig. 2C). Cofilin is also phosphorylated by the Ser/Thr kinase TESKs (13Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated whether kinase-inactive TESK1-(D170A) and TESK2(D176A) could block the ILK effects. Transfection of the TESK mutants abolished the basal, but not ILK overexpression-enhanced, pS3cofilin of Fn-adherent cells (Fig. 2D). These observations indicate that ILK enhanced pS3cofilin in a TESK-independent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of c-Src by PP2 inhibited the ILK effect on pS3cofilin (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of ROCK by Y27632 decreased pY416c-Src, as did the c-Src inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 2A). Therefore, it is likely that the ROCK inhibition-mediated effect might be a result of nonspecific c-Src inhibition. To confirm that c-Src was required for the ILK effect, we examined pS3cofilin in suspended or Fn-adherent SYF-/- (c-Src/Yes/Fyn-deficient) fibroblasts after ILK-encoding adenovirus infection or Y27632 pretreatment. These conditions did not significantly alter pS3cofilin, supporting that c-Src was required for the ILK effects (Fig. 2E). Meanwhile, the SYF-/- cells appeared to regulate pS3cofilin via LIMK1 because LIMK1 suppression reduced pS3cofilin (Fig. 2F). ILK Binds c-Src—Because ILK increased pS3cofilin in a c-Src activity-dependent manner, we examined whether ILK might bind active c-Src (i.e. pY416c-Src). We did this by microscopic visualization of their colocalization in Fn-adherent cells using a specific c-Src inhibitor, PP2. ILK was colocalized with pY416c-Src on the periphery of Fn-adherent cells, and PP2 pretreatment abolished their colocalization (Fig. 3A). We next performed an in vitro pulldown assay using recombinant GST-c-Src proteins and RIE1-α5 extracts to determine whether ILK directly interacts with c-Src. ILK from only Fn-adherent (but not suspended) cells bound to the WT GST-c-Src, which was abolished by PP2 treatment (Fig. 3B, left panel). This observation indicates that the binding depended on c-Src activity. c-Src has an SH2 and SH3 domain at its N-terminal end (23Shattil S.J.

Recombinant GST-SH3 (of c-Src), but not GST alone, showed significant binding to ILK from Fn-adherent (but not suspended) cells, although GST-SH2 (of c-Src) showed just a detectable binding (Fig. 3B, right panel). Next we determined which part of ILK binds to c-Src. Because ILK bound to GST-SH3 (of c-Src), the proline-rich regions of ILK could interface with the c-Src SH3 domain. Human ILK (NP_004508) has three proline-rich regions in its kinase domain. The in vitro pulldown assay of the recombinant GST-ILK proteins (Fig. 3C) clearly showed a direct interaction between the intact kinase domain of ILK and c-Src; GST-ILK proteins without the whole or any part of the kinase domain of ILK failed to bind c-Src, whereas GST-ILK proteins with the WT or intact kinase domain itself of ILK bound to c-Src (Fig. 3D). In addition, coimmunoprecipitation of c-Src was next examined from ILK immunoprecipitates of RIE1-α5 extracts. ILK clearly coimmunoprecipitated c-Src in cells adherent on Fn, but not suspended, and the association was abolished by inactive c-Src(Y416F) expression (Fig. 3E). These observations indicate that ILK can associate with active c-Src. However, kinase-dead ROCK1 expression did not completely abolish the cell adhesion-dependent ILK association with c-Src, indicating again that the ILK·c-Src complex formation is at least in part irrelevant to the ROCK1 activity (Fig. 3E). Active c-Src-associated ILK Phosphorylates Cofilin—ILK-enhanced pS3cofilin depended on c-Src activity because pretreatment with PP2 to inhibit c-Src family kinase abolished ILK-enhanced pS3cofilin, whereas treatment with PP3 (a negative control compound of PP2) did not (Figs. 2A and 4A). In addition, ILK bound directly to c-Src (Fig. 3). We thus examined if ILK kinase activity might be modulated via c-Src association by performing an in vitro kinase assay of ILK immunoprecipitates using MBP or GST-cofilin as substrates. ILK immunoprecipitates from adherent, but not suspended, cells efficiently phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues of MBP (Fig. 4B) and Ser3 of recombinant GST-cofilin (Fig. 4C), which was abolished by PP2 treatment of the reaction mixture (Fig. 4, B and C). In addition, ILK immunoprecipitates from adherent cells had a higher pY416c-Src compared with those from suspended cells, which was inhibited by PP2 treatment (Fig. 4C). These observations suggest that active c-Src-associated-ILK caused pS3cofilin. Because interaction of ILK with GST-SH2 (of c-Src) was just detectable (Fig. 3B, right panel), it is likely that the ILK-associated c-Src might phosphorylate and affect the ILK activity. However, we could not observe Tyr phosphorylation in ILK (data not shown), indicating that active c-Src might activate ILK indirectly through an unidentified molecule(s). EGF Treatment Blocks ILK-enhanced pS3cofilin—We next evaluated if extracellular stimulation by EGF affected the adhesion-dependent ILK effects. EGF treatment of cells replated on Fn was performed for the last 5 min of the replating period before cell harvesting and immunoblotting. EGF treatment abolished the basal and ILK overexpression-enhanced pS3cofilin in Fn-adherent cells (Fig. 5A). EGF treatment and/or inactive c-Src(Y416F) expression abolished the basal and ILK-enhanced pS3cofilin in Fn-adherent cells, although EGF-mediated Erk activation in the adherent cells was irrelevant to ILK infection (Fig. 5, A and B). Expression of c-Src(Y527F) (in which the inhibitory phosphorylation site was mutated) did not alter pS3cofilin levels compared with the control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5C), indicating that cell adhesion-mediated activation of endogenous c-Src could afford ILK/cofilin in the absence of EGF treatment and the EGFR/Erk pathway in the presence of EGF treatment (see “Discussion”). EGF treatment of adherent cells abolished the colocalization between ILK and pY416c-Src (Fig. 5D), ILK binding to WT GST-c-Src or GST-SH3 (of c-Src) (Fig. 3B), and ILK activity for MBP substrate (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the EGF treatment data indicate that the linkage from ILK to cofilin is biologically functional. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion triggers diverse intracellular signals leading to actin polymerization. ILK binds to integrin β subunits by forming a modular platform for protein complexes to rearrange actin filaments (24Qian Y. Zhong X. Flynn D.C. Zheng J.Z. Qiao M. Wu C. Dedhar S. Shi X. Jiang B.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3154-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, cofilin severs actin filaments, depending on its Ser3 phosphorylation status (7Huang T.Y. DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 25Ohta Y. Kousaka K. Nagata-Ohashi K. Ohashi K. Muramoto A. Shima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although ILK and cofilin are both involved in the actin organization, their functional linkage is largely unknown. Our observations in this study provide evidence for a new functional linkage of ILK to cofilin for actin polymerization, showing that association between ILK and c-Src affected ILK activity to phosphorylate cofilin during cell adhesion. Although integrin-mediated cell adhesion is suggested to involve ILK·paxillin·FAK complexes at the focal adhesions (26Hehlgans S. Haase M. Cordes N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), ILK-enhanced pS3cofilin was irrelevant to FAK, paxillin, and Akt phosphorylation. The ILK(E359K) mutant deficient for paxillin and parvin binding (18Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1568-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and putatively kinase-dead with residual kinase activity (19Boulter E. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) still supported the ILK-enhanced pS3cofilin, but the ILK(S343A) mutant with abolished kinase activity (20Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) blocked the ILK-mediated effects. Therefore, the ILK effect on cofilin phosphorylation appeared to require its activity. Cofilin is known to be phosphorylated by LIMKs or TESKs (13Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 22Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ROCK1 phosphorylates LIMKs (21Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the adhesion-dependent pS3cofilin in RIE1-α5 cells without exogenous ILK expression in this study could be regulated by ROCK1, LIMK1, TESKs, and ILK as well; transient transfection of kinase-dead ROCK1 or TESKs or of siRNAs against LIMK1 or ILK abolished cell adhesion-dependent pS3cofilin. However, our results indicate that ILK overexpression-mediated pS3cofilin did not significantly involve ROCK1, LIMK1, and TESKs. The basal cell adhesion-dependent pS3cofilin was abolished by expression of kinase-dead ROCK1, but ILK overexpression-mediated pS3cofilin was still significantly maintained. Kinase-dead ROCK1 expression did not disrupt the association between ILK and c-Src. It is thus likely that ILK affects pS3cofilin, at least partially, in a ROCK1-independent manner. In addition, pT508LIMK1 was not correlated with the ILK effects, and furthermore, LIMK1 suppression did not significantly inhibit the ILK overexpression-mediated pS3cofilin. These observations indicate that ILK overexpression-mediated pS3cofilin in RIE1-α5 cells might be irrelevant to LIMK1. Meanwhile, α-parvin (actopaxin) binds ILK, paxillin (27Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and TESK1 to cause cellular spreading on Fn (28LaLonde D.P. Brown M.C. Bouverat B.P. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21680-21688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that ILK can be relevant to TESKs. However, transfection of the kinase-inactive TESK1 and TESK2 mutants abolished the basal, but not ILK overexpression-enhanced, pS3cofilin of Fn-adherent cells, indicating that ILK enhanced pS3cofilin in a TESK-independent manner. However, the ILK overexpression-mediated pS3cofilin appeared to be dependent on c-Src activity in adherent cells; pharmacological inhibitor treatment or kinase-inactive c-Src transfection abolished ILK-mediated pS3cofilin in Fn-adherent cells. On the other hand, pS3cofilin in c-Src-deficient SYF-/- cells was not dependent on ILK (overexpression) but required LIMK1. Therefore, these observations suggest that active c-Src may be involved in the ILK-mediated pS3cofilin. ILK binds diverse molecules to rearrange actin filaments during integrin-mediated cell adhesion (26Hehlgans S. Haase M. Cordes N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), although the interaction of ILK with c-Src or cofilin remains relatively unknown. Consistent with the observations that ILK enhanced pS3cofilin in a c-Src activity-dependent manner, in vitro pulldown analysis revealed that the kinase domain of ILK interacted directly with the SH3 domain of c-Src. The pY416c-Src of ILK immuno-precipitates from adherent cells was observed to be higher than that from suspended cells. Furthermore, in vitro kinase assays also supported that ILK could interact with and phosphorylate GST-cofilin, which was abolished by the inhibition of c-Src that was presumably associated with ILK. Although the kinase domain of ILK is involved in many protein interactions for actin reorganization (19Boulter E. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the interaction of ILK with c-Src is for the first time revealed and indicates a new signaling linkage to regulate cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization during adhesion of RIE1-α5 cells. The ILK-enhanced pS3cofilin seems not to be biologically functional or significant in the signal contexts that c-Src is not significantly activated or regulated, however, because we observed that pS3cofilin in c-Src/Yes/Fyn-deficient SYF-/- cells was regulated by LIMK1, but not by ILK·c-Src linkage. Interestingly, EGF treatment abolished the basal and ILK overexpression-enhanced pS3cofilin in Fn-adherent RIE1-α5 cells. Signaling cross-talks between the integrin and the growth factor receptor (29Lee J.W. Juliano R. Mol. Cells. 2004; 17: 188-202PubMed Google Scholar) can be regulated by ILK (30Dedhar S. Williams B. Hannigan G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This finding was thus unexpected because EGF treatment is mitogenic and positive for Akt and GSK3β activation (31Persad S. Dedhar S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and because EGF signaling requires c-Src (32Leu T.H. Maa M.C. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: S28-S38Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Previous reports showed that EGF treatment or EGFR activity was negatively or positively correlated with pS3cofilin, indicating contradictory roles of EGFR signaling in pS3cofilin (33Jung J. Kim M. Choi S. Kim M-J. Suh J.-K. Choi E.C. Lee K. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34Marcoux N. Vuori K. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The observation of no significant change in Erks even with c-Src(Y416F) expression, which led to the blockade of ILK-mediated pS3cofilin, supports the idea that there can be two distinct pools of active c-Src involved in either ILK-mediated pS3cofilin or the EGFR/Erk pathway; cell adhesion-mediated activation of endogenous c-Src could support ILK/cofilin in the absence of EGF treatment and the EGFR/Erk pathway in the presence of EGF treatment (Fig. 5C). We may thus speculate that EGF treatment-dependent intracellular signal pathways might extract active c-Src from the ILK·c-Src·cofilin complex or linkage, leading to down-regulation of ILK-mediated Ser3 phosphorylation of cofilin. In neutrophils, cofilin was dephosphorylated by treatment with diverse chemoattractants via phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-mediated protein kinase C and Ca2+ pathways (35Zhan Q. Bamburg J.R. Badwey J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 54: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). EGF can act as a chemoattractant for spatial and temporal regulation of the actin cytoskeleton via modulation of actin binding proteins, such as cofilin. ILK is a Ser/Thr kinase binding to the β1 integrin cytoplasmic tail at focal adhesions (8Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). With dynamic focal adhesion turnover and membrane ruffling around the leading edge of a migrating cell, integrin-mediated adhesion may lead to activation of ILK to regulate cofilin phosphorylation and activity. EGF treatment caused the activation of cofilin to sever actin filaments to result in early generation of free barbed ends that participate in the nucleation of actin polymerization at the leading edges of migratory MTLn3 cells (36Chan A.Y. Bailly M. Zebda N. Segall J.E. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may not be ruled out that ILK·c-Src complex-mediated regulation of cofilin phosphorylation and activity participates in the severing of actin filaments to generate their free barbed ends at the leading edges of RIE1-α5 cells, although regulation of cofilin activity by phospholipid was recently shown to occur at the leading edge of carcinoma MTLn3 cells (37van Rheenen J. Song X. van Roosmalen W. Cammer M. Chen X. DesMarais V. Yip S-C. Backer J.M. Eddy R.J. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). More detailed understanding of the significance of the ILK·c-Src complex-mediated cofilin phosphorylation in dynamic actin remodeling can have important implications for our comprehension of physiological and pathological processes, such as cell adhesion/migration and cancer metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W1975289975,"Coenzyme F(420), a hydride carrier, is found in Archaea and some bacteria and has crucial roles in methanogenesis, antibiotic biosynthesis, DNA repair, and activation of antitubercular compounds. CofD, 2-phospho-l-lactate transferase, catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of F(420)-0 (F(420) without polyglutamate), by transferring the lactyl phosphate moiety of lactyl(2)diphospho-(5')guanosine to 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin ribitol (Fo). CofD is highly conserved among F(420)-producing organisms, and weak sequence homologs are also found in non-F(420)-producing organisms. This superfamily does not share any recognizable sequence conservation with other proteins. Here we report the first crystal structures of CofD, the free enzyme and two ternary complexes, with Fo and P(i) or with Fo and GDP, from Methanosarcina mazei. The active site is located at the C-terminal end of a Rossmann fold core, and three large insertions make significant contributions to the active site and dimer formation. The observed binding modes of Fo and GDP can explain known biochemical properties of CofD and are also supported by our binding assays. The structures provide significant molecular insights into the biosynthesis of the F(420) coenzyme. Large structural differences in the active site region of the non-F(420)-producing CofD homologs suggest that they catalyze a different biochemical reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1985384678,"Nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) is integral to the transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, but its control over various respiratory genes overlaps other regulatory elements including those involved in O2 sensing. Aerobic metabolism generally suppresses hypoxia-sensitive genes, e.g. via hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), but mutations in Complex II-succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a tumor suppressor, stabilize HIF-1, producing pseudo-hypoxia. In aerobic cardiomyocytes, which rely on oxidative phosphorylation, we tested the hypothesis that NRF-1 regulates Complex II expression and opposes hypoxia-inducible factor-1. NRF-1 gene silencing blocked aerobic succinate oxidation, increasing nuclear HIF-1α protein prior to the loss of Complex I function. We postulated that NRF-1 suppression either specifically decreases the expression of one or more SDH subunits and increases succinate availability to regulate HIF-1 prolyl hydroxylases, or stimulates mitochondrial reactive oxygen production, which interferes with HIF-1α degradation. Using promoter analysis, gene silencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, NRF-1 was found to bind to the gene promoters of two of four nuclear-encoded Complex II subunits: SDHa and SDHd, but the enzyme activity was dynamically regulated through the catalytic SDHa flavoprotein. Complex II was inactivated by SDHa silencing, which led to aerobic HIF-1α stabilization, nuclear translocation, and enhanced expression of glucose transporters and heme oxygenase-1. This was unrelated to mitochondrial ROS production, reversible by high α-ketoglutarate concentrations, and coherent with regulation of HIF-1 by succinate reported in tumor cells. These findings disclose a novel role for NRF-1 in the transcriptional control of Complex II and prevention of pseudo-hypoxic gene expression in aerobic cardiac cells.

The NRF-1 transcription factor binds as a homodimer to promoter sites in nuclear-encoded genes involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis as well as genes encoding selected subunits of the five respiratory complexes (6Kelly D.P. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). NRF-1 also binds regulatory elements in genes involved in cell cycle control and proliferation, overlapping most notably with E2F target genes involved in DNA replication, mitosis, and cytokinesis (7Cam H.

NRF-1 occupancy has been reported in 5% of gene promoters in living human cells (7Cam H. Balciunaite E. Blais A. Spektor A. Scarpulla R.C. Young R. Kluger Y. Dynlacht B.D. Mol.

Although NRF-1 has been implicated in nuclear activation of genes encoding subunits of all five respiratory complexes (1Scarpulla R.C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), its role in the integrative expression of different mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins is neither clearly elucidated nor is it known whether it has a role in oxygen (O2) sensing. Mammalian cells sense O2 deprivation by activating the transcription of adaptive hypoxia-inducible genes: glucose transporters, vascular endothelial growth factor, and erythropoietin (9Chen C.

This response facilitates glycolytic ATP production until O2 delivery improves via enhanced erythropoiesis and angiogenesis. O2 sensing is regulated in part by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a heterodimer of HIF-1α and HIF-1β of the ARNT family of transcription factors (10Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). Both subunits are required for DNA binding and gene activation, but only HIF-1α is regulated by the cellular O2 tension. In the presence of O2, the HIF-1α subunit is targeted for proteosomal degradation by prolyl hydroxylases (PHD 1-3) that utilize α-ketoglutarate in the presence of ferrous iron and ascorbate to hydroxylate specific proline residues catalytically and liberate CO2 and succinate (11Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). The stabilization of HIF-1α under aerobic conditions, called pseudo-hypoxia, is a feature of some tumors related to inactivation of mitochondrial Complex II, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH; succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) (12Selak M.A. Duran R.V.

HIF-1 activation by SDH inactivation has been proposed to involve one of two mitochondrial mechanisms, one entails mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, while the other requires egress of mitochondrial succinate; either would inhibit cytoplasmic HIF PHDs and stabilize the α-subunit (12Selak M.A. Duran R.V.

J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Janssen R.J. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J.A. Expert Rev. Mol. Diagn. 2004; 4: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Complex II inhibition or the generation of ROS at Complex III leading to HIF-1 activation have implicated ETC disturbances to hypoxic gene expression; moreover, Complex I or IV defects that allow the molecular O2 concentration in the cell to rise may destabilize HIF-1α, e.g. as shown by nitric oxide binding to the oxidase (21Hagen T. Taylor C.T. Lam F. Moncada S. Science. 2003; 302: 1975-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, down-regulation of NRF-1-regulated gene expression could increase HIF-1α stability by multiple mechanisms. Here we tested the hypothesis that NRF-1 interference promotes HIF-1 activity in aerobic cardiomyocytes by either: (i) decreasing specific SDH subunit expression and increasing succinate availability, thereby regulating prolyl hydroxylase activity, or (ii) enhancing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production at Complex II or III that prevents the degradation of the HIF-1 α-subunit. Cell Culture—Two cell lines were used: H9c2 cells derived from embryonic rat ventricle (American Type Culture Collection) and primary ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from rat heart. H9c2 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/100-mm plate and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (high serum, growth-promoting medium) renewed every second day. Cells were switched to DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum (low serum, differentiation-promoting medium, DM) for differentiation after reaching subconfluence (70-80%, 3-4 days). H9c2 cell morphology was followed daily by phase contrast microscopy to confirm differentiation, including myotube formation and expression of myogenic transcription factors, calcium channel proteins, and LIM protein FHL2 (22Menard C.

Rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated using a kit (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) from 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats under an approved animal protocol and the cardiomyocytes cultured at 37 °C (density of 6 × 104 cells/cm2) in DMEM/F12 supplemented with antibiotics, 10% horse serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), and 10 μg/ml fibronectin. These cardiomyocytes beat spontaneously, and their purity was >97% by immunochemical staining with anti-cardiac sarcomeric α-actinin and fluorescence microscopy. Cells for transfection were grown in standard culture dishes, and those for immunofluorescence and fluorescent oxidative stress assays were grown on Nunc Lab-Tech Permanox glass chamber two-well slides (Fisher Scientific). All experiments were performed in separate triplicate cultures, and ten groups were analyzed: control cells grown in air + 5% CO2 (aerobic conditions); cells grown in aerobic conditions plus dichloromethane (DCM, 50-100 μm for 24 h); aerobic cells exposed to DMOG (1 mm) for 24 h; aerobic cells fed α-ketoglutarate (2 mm); aerobic cells transfected with small interfering (si) SDHa, siNRF-1, or SDHa, or siNRF-1 plus SDHa or with scrambled siRNA; or aerobic cells incubated with 5 μm MG132 for 24 h. Final doses were chosen from preliminary studies. Antibodies and Other Reagents—A specific polyclonal anti-NRF-1 was developed and characterized using a unique peptide of amino acid sequence 262-279 of human NRF-1, highly homologous to the mouse and rat (24Piantadosi C.A. Suliman H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 324-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 25Suliman H.B. Carraway M.S. Tatro L.G. Piantadosi C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits. Antiserum was screened for specificity against recombinant NRF-1 produced by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI). The antibody was adsorbed to the peptide and tested by Western blot analysis to confirm NRF-1 specificity. Anti-tubulin and anti-β-actin were obtained from Sigma, and anti-myogenin, Glut1, Glut2, and Glut4 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-HIF1α was from either Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) or Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Anti-Hyp-P564 antibody was obtained from Genaxis. All other chemicals and reagents, including RPMI and DMEM with 25 mm Hepes and 4.5 g/liter glucose, were from Sigma. Gene Silencing—These experiments were performed using small interfering NRF-1 (siNRF-1) or siSDHa duplexes to target sequences in the open-reading frames of NRF-1 or SDHa mRNA. Multiple nucleotide sense and antisense siRNAs were synthesized and obtained in annealed form from Ambion. SiRNA target sequences were submitted to BLAST searches against other rat genome sequences to ensure specificity. After preliminary studies, one pair of siRNA sequences was selected and transfected at concentrations of 40 or 80 μm into cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences) sense NRF-1, 5′-GGAGGUUAAUUCAGAGCUG-3′, and antisense NRF-1, 5′-CAGCUCUGAAUUAACCUCC-3′ and sense SDHa, 5′-GCAAGAAGGCAUCCGCUAAtt-3′, and antisense SDHa, 5′-UUAGCGGAUGCCUUCUUGCtc-3′. A scrambled negative control siRNA was also used. The experiments were conducted at transfection efficiencies of 60-80% determined by co-transfection with fluorescent double-stranded oligonucleotides. Inhibition of NRF-1 by siNRF-1 was established by Western blot analysis and inhibition of SDHa by siSDHa by RT-PCR using specific primers for rat SDHa and by Western blot with mouse monoclonal anti-human SDHa and SDHb (Invitrogen). Cardiomyocytes were transfected with SDHa cloned in pCMV6-XL5 expression vector (OriGene, Rockville, MD) 48 h after plating using FuGENE 6 and transfection efficiency was checked by co-transfection with a green fluorescent protein construct. Cells were exposed to the transfection mix for 8 h, then grown in PC-1/F-12 minimal essential medium for 24, 48, or 72 h. Nuclear and Mitochondrial Proteins and Respiration—The nuclear and mitochondrial fractions were obtained from disrupted cells by differential centrifugation. Nuclear extracts were prepared in 0.3 m NaCl, 1 m urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), and 1 mm dithiothreitol (26Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1871-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Respiration was measured by polarography at 35 °C in digitonin (0.02%)-permeabilized cells in a standard respiration buffer with or without additions of 0.5 mm ADP, uncoupler 100 μm carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), Complex III inhibitor 50 μm antimycin A, or substrates: 1 mm ascorbate + 100 μm TMPD, 5-10 mm succinate, or 2.5 mm glutamate + 2.5 mm malate (25Suliman H.B.

Res. 2004; 64: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were transfected with siNRF-1 or siSDHa or scrambled RNA (scRNA) using FuGENE 6 and grown for 24, 48, or 72 h post-transfection. For Western blots, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 150 mm mercaptoethanol. The samples were sonicated, boiled in Laemmli buffer (10-20 μg of protein), followed by electrophoresis on 8 or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinyldifluoride membranes. Nuclear extracts were also prepared from cultured cells to check for HIF-1α nuclear protein (24Piantadosi C.A. Suliman H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 324-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For electrophoresis, 15-20 μg of cellular, nuclear, or mitochondrial protein per lane were used, membranes blocked with 5% dry de-fatted milk, incubated with monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody or anti-NRF-1 or anti-SDH, followed by secondary antibody and detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-HIF-1 antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose. The precipitates were washed in 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin and further washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 nm NaCl, and 100 mm Na3VO4. The samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer and separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with Anti-Hyp-P564. The blots were developed, and spots quantified on digitized images from the mid-dynamic range. Analysis of band intensities was performed by Image-Quant (Bio-Rad). RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells followed by reverse transcription with a first-strand RT-PCR kit (Promega) using the manufacturer's instructions. Preliminary assays were done by conventional RT-PCR using the primer sequences in Table 1. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with TaqMan gene expression and premix assays for SDHa, -b, -c, and -d (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems) Real-time PCR system. To detect SDH subunit induction, relative expression for each assay was normalized against GAPDH (TaqMan® Endogenous Controls) using the recommended comparative threshold cycle CT method. Because of the exponential PCR reaction, a difference of n in Ct values represents a 2-fold difference in transcript levels. PCR was performed in triplicate, and experiments were repeated in triplicate.TABLE 1Gene primers used for RT-PCR and PCRGeneOligonucleotide (5′-3′)Annealing temperature°CSDHa (mRNA)AACACTGGAGGAAGCACACC60GCAACTCGAGTCCCTCACATSDHb (mRNA)GGAGGGCAAGCAACAGTATC60TGCAATTGCTTTTCCTGGATSDHc (mRNA)TTGGTTCTTGCAGTGCTGTC60CAAGAAGCAGCACAAAGCTGSDHd (mRNA)CACATCCACCTGTCACCAAG60AAGTAGCAAAGCCCAGCAAASDHa (DNA)CACTTACCCCTGGAGCAAAG68CTGGTGTGGCGCTTGGAAGSDHb (DNA)TTCCCTCTTTCCCGCTGCTC68TTTTGGCTCCTGACGTCAGCCSDHc (DNA)ATGCACTAACTAATCACTC68GGACGCTGTCATGTGACACCSDHd (DNA)GGCCATGGTCAGCGTCAAT68CCCAGCTTTAAGAGAACCGCC Open table in a new tab In-gel Enzyme Activity Staining—In-gel staining of SDH activity relies on formazan precipitation as purple crystals derived from the reduction of nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT). The colorless dye accepts hydrogen during oxidation by NADH and FADH2 dehydrogenases. NBT accepts hydrogen directly from NADH systems, e.g. Complex I, whereas dye reduction by SDH is enhanced by an artificial electron carrier, phenazine methosulfate (PMS). In control H9c2 cells or those transfected with siSDHa for 24 h, the plasma membrane was disrupted, the nuclei removed, and the mitochondrial complexes separated by non-denaturing PAGE. The gels were rinsed in distilled H2O and incubated in PMS and NBT buffer for varying times in the dark at room temperature (28Sabar M. Balk J. Leaver C.J. Plant J. 2005; 44: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by fixation in 45% (v/v) methanol and 10% (v/v) acetic acid and the gels de-stained overnight in the same solution. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—H9c2 cells (∼4.0 × 106) cultured in 15-cm plates were treated 100 μm DCM or transfected with siNRF-1. After 24 h, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde (cross-linker) for 7.5 min, harvested, sonicated (into ∼500 bp fragments) in media to achieve a final concentration of 1%, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Formaldehyde was quenched with 0.125 m glycine. Cells were washed with PBS, harvested, and processed with the ChIP IT Assay Kit (Active Motif) and NRF-1 antibody. After ethanol precipitation, DNA was resuspended in 200 μl/107 cells, and 2-5 μl used for the PCR template. Input samples representing 1% of total DNA were diluted at 1:5 and IP fractions 1:2. PCR was carried out on 1-μl samples using validated primer sets for SDHa, SDHb, SDHc, and SDHd 5′-untranslated regions (Table 1). Total input DNA was also tracked through the assay by PCR using primers that amplify 223 bp from the β-actin promoter. The primer mix came from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) and was used as recommended. Preimmune rabbit serum (IgG) was used for IP and purified DNA for PCR of the SDH subunits (Table 1). PCR products were analyzed on 2% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels and normalized to total DNA in each sample. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—H9c2 cell were grown in two-well chamber slides to 60-70% confluence to avoid hypoxia. Cells were transfected with siSDHa for 24 h or transfected with siSDHa and incubated with 2 mm α-ketoglutarate for 6 h. Cells were treated with MitoTracker Green (1 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 10% normal horse serum (Dako Corp.) in PBS and for 2 h with anti-HIF-1α at 1:100 in PBS containing 5% horse serum. After three 15-min washes in PBS with gentle agitation, cells were labeled for 1 h with goat anti-mouse FluoroLink Cy3-labeled (Molecular Probes) at a 1:100 dilution in PBS containing 5% horse serum, washed three times in PBS, cover-slipped using Slow Fade (Invitrogen) mounting medium, and observed by confocal microscopy (Zeiss 410 LSCM). For all samples, images were collected at ×620 magnification in the fluorescence mode using identical settings, and images merged electronically. ROS Production—To localize ROS production, cells were transfected or exposed to DCM/CO and incubated 24-h later with MitoSox (1 μm) and MitoTracker Green (Molecular Probes) for 10 min followed by fluorescence confocal microscopy at 568 nm (MitoSox) and 488 nm (MitoTracker) on a Model 410 LSCM (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc). Control and treated samples were scanned at ×620 using the same parameters, and the images collected in fluorescence mode and merged electronically. Statistics—Grouped data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by two-way analysis of variance using commercial software. A value of p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. Respiration and Mitochondrial Complex II Activity—Oxidative phosphorylation substrate utilization in H9c2 cardiomyocytes was examined before and after NRF-1 silencing. As a positive control, NRF-1 expression, which in these cells involves mitochondrial oxidant production, was stimulated with DCM/CO (25Suliman H.B. Carraway M.S. Tatro L.G. Piantadosi C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). At the baseline, the cells expressed immunoreactive nuclear NRF-1 protein, which was increased 2-fold by DCM/CO and blocked (>90%) 24 h after transfection with siRNA (Fig. 1A). scRNA had no effect on NRF-1 protein expression. Within 24 h after NRF-1 silencing, cell respiration became compromised; however, loss of FADH-linked respiration appeared early and was more sensitive to siNRF-1 than NADH-linked (malate + glutamate) respiration (Fig. 1B). scRNA had no effect on respiration, and the oxidation of ascorbate-TMPD (+antimycin A) was intact 24 h after NRF-1 silencing (data not shown). NRF-1-dependent gene expression is thus necessary for carbon entry into the ETC in rat cardiomyocytes, and Complex II is exquisitely sensitive to loss of NRF-1 gene expression. SDH Subunit Gene Expression—The effects of NRF-1 silencing on succinate oxidation and the association of Complex II activity with HIF-1α stabilization implicated NRF-1 in the prevention of pseudo-hypoxia through transcriptional regulation SDH, for which all four subunits are nuclear-encoded. On the basis of a bioinformatics promoter analysis, we focused on NRF-1 (and did not investigate NRF-2); moreover, NRF-1 is not up-regulated by mild hypoxia, and the NRF-1 promoter does not contain a canonical HIF-1 consensus motif. Using RT-PCR, we evaluated the extent to which NRF-1 regulates steady-state mRNA levels for SDHa, -b, -c, and -d in H9c2 cardiomyocytes and whether suppressing it deregulates one or more subunits. As a positive control, DCM/CO (50-100 μm) was used to stimulate NRF-1; this increased SDHa mRNA content 3-fold in cardiomyocytes, but SDHb, -c, and -d mRNA less than 2-fold (Fig. 2A). siNRF-1 transfection suppressed mRNA expression for two of four SDH subunits: a and d, for 48 h (Fig. 2B; 18 S rRNA is the densitometry reference for subunit mRNA) but the effect was far greater for SDHa mRNA (∼17-fold). This implies a large dynamic range for NRF-1 in regulating the catalytic flavoprotein that converts succinate to fumarate in Complex II. NRF-1 Silencing Increases Nuclear HIF-1α Accumulation and Arrests Cardiomyocyte Differentiation—Studies were done under aerobic conditions to measure the influence of NRF-1 on HIF-1 without the O2 limitation of hypoxia. Aerobic H9c2 cells transfected with siNRF-1 had significant increases in nuclear HIF-1α protein (Fig. 2C). By comparison, DCM/CO, which inhibits cytochrome c oxidase and stimulates mitochondrial ROS in these cells, had the converse effect on nuclear HIF-1α. After serum removal, embryonic H9c2 rat heart cells proliferate in high serum medium and differentiate over 96 h. Here the use of siNRF-1 inhibited myotubule formation (not shown), thus making it possible that HIF-1α behaves differently in differentiated myocytes. In primary rat cardiomyocytes, nuclear HIF-1α nuclear protein content was stimulated 10-fold by siNRF-1 or siSDHa (Fig. 2D), connecting NRF-1, via mitochondrial ETC function or cell cycle interactions, or both, with HIF-1 regulation throughout cardiac differentiation.

Atf1 is phosphorylated by Sty1 yet this phosphorylation is not required for stress-induced gene expression, suggesting another mechanism exists whereby Sty1 activates transcription. Here we show that Sty1 associates with Atf1-dependent genes and is recruited to both their promoters and coding regions. This occurs in response to various stress conditions coincident with the kinetics of the activation of Sty1. Association with promoters is not a consequence of increased nuclear accumulation of Sty1 nor does it require the phosphorylation of Atf1. However, recruitment is completely abolished in a mutant lacking Sty1 kinase activity. Both Atf1 and its binding partner Pcr1 are required for association of Sty1 with Atf1-dependent promoters, suggesting that this heterodimer must be intact for optimal recruitment of the MAPK. However, many Atf1-dependent genes are still expressed in a pcr1Δ mutant but with significantly delayed kinetics, thus providing an explanation for the relatively mild stress sensitivity displayed by pcr1Δ. Consistent with this delay, Sty1 and Atf1 cannot be detected at these promoters in this condition, suggesting that their association with chromatin is weak or transient in the absence of Pcr1.

All cells sense and react to changes in their environment. Single-celled organisms are especially vulnerable to such events and must respond to alterations in pH, osmolarity, and temperature as well as contending with potentially harmful toxins. One of the major ways in which cells respond to such changes is by radically altering their program of gene expression, leading to increased levels of proteins with stress protectant functions and a decrease in non-essential activities; this enables resources to be concentrated on adaptation to stress and the repair of damaged macromolecules (reviewed in Ref. 1Gasch A.P. Yeast. 2007; 24: 961-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).

In fission yeast, the Sty1 MAPK (also known as Spc1/Phh1, hereafter referred to as Sty1), is closely related to p38 and like its mammalian counterpart, responds to a variety of stimuli including osmotic, oxidative, and heat stress (7Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 8Millar J.B. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to stressors, Sty1 is activated by its MAPK kinase (Wis1), via phosphorylation at Thr171 and Tyr173 and consequently translocates to the nucleus (7Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 10Gaits F. Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Activated Sty1 phosphorylates a number of targets including the bZIP transcription factor Atf1, the fission yeast homologue of mammalian ATF2 (11Shiozaki K. Russell P.

Both Sty1 and Atf1 are required for many of the stress-induced transcriptional changes that occur upon stress; a large subset of these occur in response to several different stresses and as a result have been termed the core environmental stress response or CESR (13Chen D.

Atf1 binds to its cognate site as a dimer with a second bZIP protein, Pcr1 (14Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 704-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This heterodimer binds to DNA with much greater affinity than either homodimer (15Kon N. Krawchuk M.D. Warren B.G. Smith G.R. Wahls W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, whereas cells lacking atf1 are sensitive to a variety of insults, the stress phenotypes displayed by a pcr1 deletant are much less severe, suggesting a less crucial role in regulating gene expression (15Kon N.

Many signaling kinases, including SAPKs, modulate gene expression through regulatory phosphorylation of their target transcription factors or other chromatin-bound proteins (19Edmunds J.W. Mahadevan L.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3715-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Previously we have addressed the function of Atf1 phosphorylation by Sty1. Surprisingly, phosphorylation is not required for stress-induced activation of Atf1 target genes but rather serves to positively regulate the stability of the Atf1 protein. Accordingly, the Atf1–11M phospho-mutant protein, which lacks intact MAPK sites, displays decreased stability compared with its wild type counterpart and accumulates to a lesser extent upon stress. Nevertheless, there is still robust activation of Atf1-dependent gene expression. Consistent with this, atf1–11M does not share the stress sensitivities displayed by an atf1 deletion mutant (18Lawrence C.L. Maekawa H. Worthington J.L. Reiter W. Wilkinson C.R. Jones N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5160-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These results posed a dilemma: Atf1 is phosphorylated by Sty1; its role in stress-induced activation of gene expression is Sty1-dependent, yet phosphorylation of Atf1 by Sty1 does not appear to be critical for transcriptional activation per se. Thus, what is the essential role of Sty1 in stress-induced gene expression? Clues may come from studies of Hog1, the budding yeast homologue of Sty1, which is primarily responsible for mediating the osmostress response in this yeast (reviewed in Ref. 20Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Hog1 can modulate transcription by phosphorylating its target transcription factors, thereby affecting their ability to activate gene expression (21de Nadal E. Casadome L. Posas F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Proft M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1307-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, utilizing the chromatin immunoprecipitation technique (ChIP), which allows the mapping of DNA-protein interactions, Hog1 was shown to associate closely with target promoters upon exposure to increased osmolarity but not in response to other stressors such as heat and ethanol (23Alepuz P.M. Jovanovic A. Reiser V. Ammerer G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The kinase is targeted and anchored to promoters by various translation factors such as Hot1. Once there, Hog1 serves to recruit key components of the general transcriptional machinery such as RNA pol II (24Alepuz P.M. de Nadal E. Zapater M. Ammerer G. Posas F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2433-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Indeed, tethering of Hog1 to an artificial promoter by use of a lexA fusion system is sufficient to drive gene expression in a stress-dependent manner (24Alepuz P.M. de Nadal E. Zapater M. Ammerer G. Posas F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2433-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, the kinase can affect transcription by directing the association of chromatin-remodeling enzymes, such as the Rpd3 histone deacetylase, to osmoresponsive promoters (25De Nadal E. Zapater M. Alepuz P.M. Sumoy L. Mas G. Posas F. Nature. 2004; 427: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These findings raised the possibility that the kinase might play a structural role during transcription in addition to functions that require its catalytic activity. Recent studies have shown that Hog1 not only regulates transcriptional initiation but also affects the elongation cycle. The kinase can associate with the ORF as well as the terminator region of osmoresponsive genes where it appears to act as a component of the RNA pol II elongation complex (26Proft M. Mas G. de Nadal E. Vendrell A. Noriega N. Struhl K. Posas F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This close association between a protein kinase involved in signal transduction and genes under its control is likely to be a widespread phenomenon. Other budding yeast protein kinases subsequently found to interact directly with chromatin include Tor1, Sch9, Snf1, subunits of PKA and the MAP kinases Fus3 and Kss1 (27Pokholok D.K. Zeitlinger J.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3098-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas in higher eukaryotes, p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) have been reported to associate with specific promoters during myogenic and adipogenic differentiation, respectively (30Simone C.

We reasoned that the essential role of Sty1 in activating stress-induced gene expression in fission yeast might involve direct association with stress-dependent genes and phosphorylation of chromatin-bound targets other than Atf1. Here we show that Sty1 is indeed recruited to promoters and ORFs of Atf1-dependent genes. Moreover, we have carried out a detailed analysis of the requirements for such association and in particular, have examined the role of the Atf1/Pcr1 heterodimer in this recruitment.

Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar); oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. The sty1 and sty1 kinase-dead (K49R) coding sequences were amplified from plasmids by PCR using primers Sty1_BamHI_fw and Sty1_nostop_re_v2 (oligonucleotide sequences available upon request). The amplified 1-kb PCR product was digested with XmaI and BamHI and subcloned into previously SmaI/BamHI cut plasmid pREP41Pkc (34Craven R.A. Griffiths D.J. Sheldrick K.S. Randall R.E. Hagan I.M. Carr A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The obtained plasmids (pREP41sty1-Pkc and pREP41sty1kd-Pkc) were digested with SacI/PstI, the resulting 3-kb band isolated and subsequently subcloned into the pINTA vector (35Petersen J. Paris J. Willer M. Philippe M. Hagan I.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4371-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which had been prepared by digestion with SacI and PstI, giving rise to plasmids pINTAsty1-Pkc and pINTAsty1kd-Pkc. The integration cassettes from plasmids pINTAsty1-Pkc and pINTAsty1kd-Pkc were obtained by a NotI digest, subsequently isolated and used for transformation of strain NJ757. Ura+/leu- colonies were selected and the integration events checked by genomic PCR and sequencing. The strains were verified by assessing cell length and stress sensitivity with the sty1-Pk (NJ760) and sty1kd-Pk (NJ765) behaving as wild type and the sty1Δ mutant, respectively. These cells were grown in minimal media to ensure full induction from the nmt41 promoter. ChIP Assays—The ChIP procedure is based on methods described elsewhere (18Lawrence C.L. Maekawa H. Worthington J.L. Reiter W. Wilkinson C.R. Jones N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5160-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with modifications: in the case of Sty1-myc ChIPs, cultures were cross-linked for 30 min with 1% formaldehyde at 24 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 15 μl of Dynal protein A-coated magnetic beads, which were previously incubated overnight with 4–5 μg of anti-Atf1 polyclonal antibody, anti-Pcr1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (18Lawrence C.L. Maekawa H. Worthington J.L. Reiter W. Wilkinson C.R. Jones N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5160-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), anti-c-myc (A-14)X rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA (12CA5, CRUK), or mouse anti-V5 TAG (Pk) antibody (Serotec), respectively. We used standard PCR as well as real-time PCR to quantify the relative amount of DNA corresponding to stress-induced genes isolated from each immunoprecipitate. For standard PCR, gpd1 was compared with the stress independent promoters, hmg1 and cdc2. Primers used are denoted relative to translation start codons and corresponded to -315 to -294 and -148 to -129 for the cdc2 promoter, -494 to -475 and -275 to -256 for the gpd1 promoter, and -423 to -404 and -149 to -130 for the hmg1 promoter. For real time PCR quantifications, the relative enrichments of gpd1, hsp9, ctt1, and pka1 were measured over a stress-independent promoter (cdc2). The relative enrichments of stress-independent genes (cdc2 ORF, pol1 ORF) were measured as negative controls. Primers used are denoted relative to translation start codons and corresponded to -214 to -192 and -177 to -144 for the cdc2 promoter, +471 to +498 and +518 to +541 for cdc2 ORF, -446 to -421 and -388 to -363 for the ctt1 promoter, +1379 to +1399 and +1423 to +1439 for the ctt1 ORF, -402 to -380 and -360 to -340 for gpd1 promoter, +612 to +628 and +646 to +665 for gpd1 ORF, +1213 to +1241 and +1266 to +1286 for gpd1 3′-untranslated region, -264 to -245 and -220 to -199 for the hsp9 promoter, -652 to -630 and -608 to -588 for the pka1 promoter, +622 to +639 and +664 to +684 for the pka1 ORF, +1615 to +1636 and +1657 to +1681 for the pka1 3′-untranslated region, +2520 to +2543 and +2567 to +2588 for pol1 ORF. In addition, the following primers were used for the pka1 promoter (-143 to -121 and -101 to -75); there was no enrichment of Sty1 to these sequences (these data were not shown as part of Fig. 7). A fraction of each IP was assayed by Western blotting to ensure that equal quantities of Sty1 were being isolated from the samples before and after stress. Western Blotting—Atf1 and Pcr1 were detected as described (18Lawrence C.L. Maekawa H. Worthington J.L. Reiter W. Wilkinson C.R. Jones N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5160-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Activated Sty1 was detected using the anti-phospho-p38 antiserum (Genway). Other antibodies used were anti-HA antiserum (12CA5-Cancer Research UK), anti-myc (Serotec), and anti-Pk (Serotec). All antibodies were used in Western blots at a dilution of 1 in 1000. Northern Blots—5 μg of total RNA isolated at the time points indicated in the figures were prepared and analyzed as described (18Lawrence C.L. Maekawa H. Worthington J.L. Reiter W. Wilkinson C.R. Jones N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5160-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For the genes shown in Fig. 10C, we also assessed their expression in a sty1-myc pcr1Δ mutant and found that the pattern of expression was identical to that shown for pcr1Δ. Microarray Experiments Culture, Stress Conditions, and Harvesting—RNA isolation, labeling, microarray hybridization, and data processing were performed as described using our in-house spotted arrays (36Lyne R. Burns G. Mata J. Penkett C.J. Rustici G. Chen D. Langford C. Vetrie D. Bahler J. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We used the same experimental design as described (13Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Bahler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar): labeled samples from each stress time point were hybridized with a labeled reference pool containing an equal amount of all the RNA samples from the wild type time points of the corresponding stress. Two independent biological repeats were processed using a dye-swap for labeling. Microarrays were scanned with a Genepix 4000B scanner and analyzed with GenePix software (Axon Instruments). After data acquisition and within array normalization, the ratios of each gene (time point/reference pool) were divided by the corresponding ratios of untreated wild type cells (0 h wild type/reference pool). Thus, the reported ratios represent the expression levels at each time point relative to the expression levels of the untreated wild type cells from the same stress experiment. Expression ratios of biological repeat experiments were averaged. Hierarchical clustering and other data evaluation were performed using Gene-Spring (Agilent). In total, 6 microarrays were used in this study and compared with the data from wild type and atf1Δ cells described in a previous study (13Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Bahler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The complete processed data set is available upon request. Immunofluoresence—For immunofluoresence microscopy, cells were fixed as described (37Wilkinson C.R. Wallace M. Morphew M. Perry P. Allshire R. Javerzat J.P. McIntosh J.R. Gordon C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6465-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For visualizing myc-tagged proteins, mouse anti-myc (Cancer Research UK, 9E10) was used at a dilution of 1 to 100. Secondary antibodies were diluted 250-fold for use (Molecular Probes, AlexaFluor 488 anti-mouse A-11001). DNA was detected with 4,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector, H-1200). Images were viewed using an Olympus BX51 microscope fitted with a 100 milliwatt epifluorescence bulb and using analysis software (Soft Imaging System, GmbH). For scoring phenotypes, a minimum of 500 cells were scored for each genotype. Sty1 Is Recruited to the gpd1 Promoter upon Osmostress with Kinetics That Are Coincident with Those of Its Own Activation—We first sought to examine whether Sty1 could associate with the promoters of stress-induced genes. Previously we have used ChIP to demonstrate that Atf1 is bound to the promoters of three stress-induced genes that form part of the CESR, namely gpd1, hsp9, and ctt1 (18Lawrence C.L. Maekawa H. Worthington J.L. Reiter W. Wilkinson C.R. Jones N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5160-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These three genes encode proteins with important stress protectant functions and they depend upon both Sty1 and Atf1 for their expression (13Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Bahler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The primer pairs used to amplify the promoters and control regions in this study are indicated in Fig. 1 along with their locations relative to the start codons. To assess whether Sty1 could associate with chromatin, we examined whether Sty1 was recruited to the gpd1 promoter upon osmotic stress using a ChIP assay analyzed by standard PCR. These experiments were performed using a strain in which the sty1 gene has been fused at its C terminus with 6 histidine residues and 2 copies of the HA epitope. This strain has previously been verified as behaving as wild type (7Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Samples were collected during 1 h of osmotic stress; association of Sty1 with the gpd1 promoter was assessed by an increase in the ratio of the PCR product generated by primers specific for the gpd1 promoter compared with the control products that were amplified by primers recognizing the non-stress-specific promoters, cdc2 and hmg1. Sty1 recruitment was evident after 5 min of stress but had receded after an hour (Fig. 2A). This association with the promoter matched the kinetics of Sty1 activation that was assessed by Western blotting of Sty1 using antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated activation site. Sty1 phosphorylation was observed at 5 min but had almost disappeared by 60 min (Fig. 2B). This recruitment is consistent with the kinetics of gpd1 transcript accumulation (Ref. 13Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Bahler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar and Fig. 10C). We observed significant amounts of gpd1 mRNA at 15 min, which had reduced considerably by 60 min. These data show that Sty1 is recruited to chromatin of an Atf1-dependent gene upon osmotic stress and that the kinetics of Sty1 activation match those of its association with the gpd1 target gene and those of transcript accumulation. This is consistent with the essential role of Sty1 in transcriptional activation requiring its direct recruitment to stress-induced genes.FIGURE 2Sty1 is recruited to the gpd1 promoter upon osmotic stress in a manner coincident with its own activation. A, ChIP assays showing recruitment of Sty1–6His2HA to the gpd1 promoter upon osmotic stress. Samples were prepared from sty1–6His2HA cells treated with 1 m sorbitol for the time points indicated (in minutes). The DNA recovered from the IP was assayed by PCR using primers specific to the gpd1, hmg1, and cdc2 promoters, the latter two of which are not induced upon stress. The control lanes show DNA amplified from two different amounts of whole cell extracts (WCE) prior to performing the IP. B, the kinetics of Sty1 activation were assayed by Western blotting of protein extracts prepared from the cells exposed to osmotic stress in A. The blots were probed with antibodies against the activation site of the p38 MAP kinase (anti-phospho-p38), which recognize the activation site of Sty1 when dually phosphorylated upon Thr171 and Tyr173. Total levels of Sty1 were assessed by re-probing the blot with anti-HA antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sty1 Is Recruited to Atf1-dependent Promoters upon a Variety of Stress Conditions—Next we assessed whether Sty1 could associate with promoters under different types of stress other than osmostress. For these assays we used a strain where the sty1 gene had been C-terminal fused with 12 copies of the myc epitope at its native locus such that the expression of sty1-myc is under the control of the sty1 promoter. In terms of phenotype and gene induction this strain behaves as wild type (Refs. 10Gaits F. Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and 38Gaits F. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1395-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar and data not shown). The sty1-myc cells were isolated in the presence and absence of stress and ChIP assays were performed in triplicate. The DNA recovered from the IPs was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Recruitment was determined by comparing the enrichment in the immunoprecipitates of regions corresponding to the gpd1, ctt1, and hsp9 promoters compared with the cdc2 control promoter, which is not expected to be bound by Sty1 (-fold over cdc2 promoter). In addition we measured recruitment to regions of DNA that would not be expected to be bound by Sty1 namely the cdc2 ORF and pol1 ORF (we have previously shown that Atf1 is not bound to these control regions (18Lawrence C.L. Maekawa H. Worthington J.L. Reiter W. Wilkinson C.R. Jones N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5160-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). We found that Sty1 is recruited to the gpd1, ctt1, and hsp9 promoters upon sorbitol-induced osmotic stress, confirming the result observed with the standard PCR assay. Upon stress we observed between 3- and 7.5-fold enrichment of these promoters in the Sty1-containing IPs compared with either the sty1-myc strain in the absence of stress or to an untagged control (wild type) (Fig. 3A). The lack of recruitment of Sty1 to promoters in the absence of stres"
https://openalex.org/W1987518625,"We recently reported a mouse model called ACE 10/10 in which macrophages overexpress the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). These mice have an enhanced inflammatory response to tumors that markedly inhibits tumor growth. Here, we show that ACE modifies the C termini of peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The peptide-processing activity of ACE applies to antigens from either the extracellular environment (cross-presentation) or antigens produced endogenously. Consistent with its role in MHC class I antigen processing, ACE localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. ACE overexpression does not appear to change the overall supply of peptides available to MHC class I molecules. The immunization of wild type mice previously given ACE 10/10 macrophages enhances the efficiency of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell priming. These data reveal that ACE is a dynamic participant in fashioning the peptide repertoire for MHC class I molecules by modifying the C termini of peptide precursors. Manipulation of peptidase expression by antigen-presenting cells may ultimately prove a useful strategy to enhance the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2075546456,"The activity of the insulin gene, Ins, in islet β cells is thought to arise in part from the synergistic action of the transcription factors Pdx1 and BETA2/NeuroD1. We asked how the binding of these factors to A and E elements many tens or hundreds of base pairs upstream of the start site could influence activity of transcriptional machinery. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the complex of Pdx1 and BETA2/NeuroD1 maintains a DNA conformation such that distal regions of the gene are brought into proximity of the promoter and coding region. We show by coimmunoprecipitation that Pdx1 and BETA2/NeuroD1 exist within a complex and that the two physically interact with one another in this complex as assessed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Consistent with this interaction, we found that the two factors simultaneously occupy the same fragment of the Ins gene in β cell lines using the chromatin immunoprecipitation/re-chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Using a modification of the chromosome conformation capture assay in vitro and in β cells, we observed that Pdx1 and BETA2/NeuroD1 mediate looping of a segment of Ins that brings EcoRI sites located at –623 and +761 bp (relative to the transcriptional start site) in proximity to one another. This looping appears to be dependent in vitro upon an intact A3 binding element, but not upon the E2 element. Based on our findings, we propose a model whereby Pdx1 and BETA2/NeuroD1 physically interact to form a nucleoprotein complex on the Ins gene that mediates formation of a short DNA loop. Our results suggest that such short loop conformations may be a general mechanism to permit interactions between transcription factors and basal transcriptional machinery.

Transcription factors function as crucial “switches” in the embryonic development of the mammalian pancreas, as they control the expression of genes in a defined temporal and spatial pattern. Of particular interest recently has been the role of transcription factors in the development of the β cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Islet β cells are solely responsible for the secretion of physiologically relevant amounts of insulin into the circulation, and their dysfunction is associated with the development of not only Type 1 but also Type 2 diabetes mellitus (1Prentki M. Nolan C. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1802-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The ParaHox factor Pdx1 and the basic helix-loop-helix factor BETA2/NeuroD1 (henceforth referred to as “NeuroD1”) are necessary for the formation of the pancreas and β cells, respectively. Pdx1 is expressed broadly in the early pancreas, and pdx1-null mice (and humans with homozygous defects) completely lack a pancreas (2Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 3Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L. Wright C.V. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pdx1 later becomes restricted to β cells, where it activates an array of β cell-specific genes and is necessary for normal glucose homeostasis (for a review, see Ref. 4Babu D. Deering T. Mirmira R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2007; 92: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NeuroD1 is expressed in developing endocrine cells of the pancreas, and its deletion in mice results in the severe reduction of endocrine cell formation and the eventual development of diabetes (5Huang H.P.

Multiple discrete DNA elements (A-, E-, and C-boxes) within the 5′ regulatory region (the “enhancer”) of the Ins gene serve as binding sites for several β cell-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors, and a similar genetic organization has been described for a host of other β cell genes, including Iapp, pdx1, Glut2, and Gck (10Chakrabarti S.K. Mirmira R.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 78-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Based on DNA binding studies in vitro and reporter gene analysis in transfected mammalian cells, Pdx1 is believed to bind to the A-boxes and NeuroD1 to the E-boxes (11Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 12Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Importantly, in the rodent and human Ins genes, tandemly occurring E/A-boxes (referred to as the “E2/A3” and “E1/A1” elements) are situated within a crucial 350-bp regulatory region upstream of the transcriptional start site (13Hay C. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3201-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In reporter gene assays, these tandem elements synergistically activate gene transcription response to Pdx1 and NeuroD1 overexpression (12Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14Glick E. Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2199-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying synergy between these factors remain poorly defined but may involve a physical interaction between the two that allosterically enhances their binding to DNA and/or enhances their recruitment of cofactors to the gene (12Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14Glick E. Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2199-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Another potential mechanism not implicated previously in activation of the Ins gene is DNA looping. A looped DNA structure may allow factors bound at more distant regions of the gene enhancer to gain access to elements of the basal transcriptional machinery, thereby allowing for recruitment or activation of these components (15Dekker J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whether such looping occurs in the Ins enhancer and whether Pdx1 and NeuroD1 might contribute to the formation of such a loop have never been investigated. In this report, we present evidence that Pdx1 and NeuroD1 physically interact within the living nucleus and form a transcriptional complex on the endogenous Ins gene. Studies in vitro suggest that the complex involving Pdx1 and NeuroD1 (with its heterodimeric partner E47) leads to a short-range DNA loop on the mouse Ins gene that brings more distal elements of the enhancer in proximity to the promoter region. We propose that this loop may allow for interactions between components of this complex and the basal transcriptional machinery and thereby contribute to synergistic activation of Ins gene transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Antibodies, and Vectors—The mouse insulinoma cell line βTC3 and the mouse pancreatic ductal cell line mPAC L20 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (16Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-Pdx1 antiserum was from R&D Systems. Mouse monoclonal anti-NeuroD1 antiserum was a gift from Dr. U. Jhala (University of California at San Diego). Goat anti-NeuroD1 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. sc-1086) and rabbit polyclonal antiserum against acetylated histone H3 were from Millipore.Expression constructs encoding the monomeric variants of green, yellow, and cyan fluorescent proteins were generated through oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange®, Stratagene) of the plasmids encoding the respective dimeric variants in the vectors pEGFP, pEYFP, and pECFP (Clontech). Fluorescent fusion proteins used in this study were constructed by subcloning the cDNAs encoding Pdx1, NeuroD1, and Nkx6.1 in-frame with the coding sequences of the respective monomeric fluorescent proteins using SacI and SalI sites.

Mutagenesis of pCRIns3C was performed using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The following oligonucleotides were used for the mutagenesis (top strands shown): E2 mutation (mutation underlined), 5′-GGGAACTGGTTCATCAGGGCGGCCGCTCCCTTATTAAGAC-3′; and A3 mutation (mutation underlined), 5′-GGCCATCTGGTCCCTTATCGCGGCCGCGATAACCCTAAGACTAAG-3′. All vectors were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and automated nucleotide sequencing.Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing ∼1 × 106 cells in a buffer containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 5 μg of extract were resolved by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by immunoblotting with anti-Pdx1 or anti-NeuroD1 antiserum. Immunoblots were visualized using the ECL-Plus® system (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated by scanning densitometry using ImageQuant® software (Amersham Biosciences).Transient Transfection of Cell Lines—For luciferase assays, a total of 5 μg of plasmid DNA consisting of 4 μg of a luciferase reporter plasmid (Ins minienhancer pFoxLuc5FF1) and 0.2 μg of pBAT12-Pdx1, pBAT12-NeuroD1, and/or pBAT14-E47 were mixed with Reagent L (Amaxa, Inc.) and transfected into 1 × 106 mPAC L20 cells using an Amaxa Nucleofector (program T-20) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were measured using a commercially available luciferase assay substrate (Promega) and a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems). To measure activation of the endogenous Ins promoter in mPAC L20 cells, only reporter DNA was omitted in transfections, and cells were harvested after 96 h for isolation of total RNA and for subsequent real-time reverse transcription-PCR of the Ins transcript as detailed previously (17Iype T.

After 96 h, cells were processed for isolation of total RNA or whole cell extracts as described previously (17Iype T. Francis J. Garmey J.C. Schisler J.C. Nesher R. Weir G.C. Becker T.C. Newgard C.B.

Sample statistics were calculated by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey post test using GraphPad Prism 5.00 software for the Mac.Quantitative Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Re-ChIP—ChIP assays, including quantitation of coimmunoprecipitated DNA fragments by real-time PCR using the threshold cycle methodology, were performed as described previously (16Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). All primer sequences were detailed previously (18Francis J. Chakrabarti S.K. Garmey J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36244-36253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Re-ChIP experiments were performed as described (19Kouskouti A. Talianidis I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, following the initial ChIP with the first antibody, protein-DNA complexes were eluted from agarose beads by incubation with 50 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min, and then the eluate was diluted to a final volume of 1 ml of ChIP buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA). The ChIP protocol was then repeated with the second antibody prior to analysis of recovered DNA fragments by real-time PCR. Sample statistics were calculated using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey post test.Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—Coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous Pdx1 and NeuroD1 from whole cell lysates of 107 βTC3 cells was performed essentially as described previously using anti-Pdx1 antiserum (20Macfarlane W.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) followed by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-NeuroD1 antibody.Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Experiments—mPAC L20 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding fluorescent fusion proteins and maintained on glass coverslips in phenol red-free culture medium for 48 h prior to fluorescence microscopy. Images for FRET were acquired on an inverted Olympus IX-70 wide-field microscope equipped with a60× oil objective lens. The Linux-based ISee acquisition software (ISee Imaging Systems) was then used to obtain images and determine gray-level intensity profiles. The filter combinations for sequential filter-based FRET were as follows: 440/20 nm excitation and 480/40 nm emission for ECFP and 545/35 nm emission for EYFP and the 525DRLP dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology Corp.). Data were collected as 12-bit monochromatic images using a cooled charge-couple device camera (CH260, Photometrics, Ltd.). Special care was taken to avoid detector saturation, and exposure times were maintained among all samples for effective post-acquisition analysis of FRET efficiency. Precision FRET data analysis was used to remove spectral bleed-through and variation in the fluorophore expression level (or concentration) for the donor and acceptor molecules (21Elangovan M. Wallrabe H. Chen Y. Day R.N. Barroso M. Periasamy A. Methods (Amst.). 2003; 29: 58-73Google Scholar). The acquired images were processed using NIH ImageJ software, and the precision FRET algorithm was used to calculate the energy transfer efficiency and the distance between donor and acceptor molecules.Modified 3C Assay—3C assays were performed as described previously (22Hagege H. Klous P. Braem C. Splinter E. Dekker J. Cathala G. de Laat W. Forne T. Nat. Protocols. 2007; 2: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) but with some modifications. For in vitro 3C assays, a reaction was prepared using 2 μl of in vitro transcribed/translated protein expressed from vectors pET-Pdx1, pET-NeuroD1, and pBAT13-E47 and 40 ng of linearized plasmid pCRIns3C. Reactions were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C in the presence of HeLa cell nuclear extract (to provide basal transcriptional proteins). The protein-DNA complexes were then fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde followed by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. The protein-DNA complexes were ethanol-precipitated overnight at –20 °C and resuspended in 30 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) with 0.1 mm EDTA. The DNA was digested with EcoRI for 1 h at 37 °C, and the enzyme was heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 20 min. The reaction was diluted 2-fold in ligation buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 1% Triton X-100), and 20 ng of the DNA were then subjected to a ligation reaction in a 40-μl volume using 2000 units of T4 DNA ligase for 5 h at 16°C. As a carrier, 40 μg of herring sperm DNA were added, and samples were brought to a volume of 100 μl and treated with proteinase K to digest protein and reverse cross-links. The DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. For quantitation of ligation products, the DNA was subjected to SYBR Green-based real-time PCR analysis using primers to detect a novel 250-bp product that would occur only in the presence of ligase (forward and reverse primers, 5′-TCTTTTTCTCTGGCATTTATTGTC-3′ and 5′-TCATTGGTCAACTGGGCTG-3′, respectively). As an internal control for input and recovery of DNA, PCR amplification was also performed using primers corresponding to a fragment of the mouse I Ins gene that was unaffected by digestion or ligation (forward and reverse primers, 5′-TCAGCCAAAGATGAAGAAGGTCTC-3′ and 5′-TCAAACACTTGCCTGGTGC-3′, respectively). PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s.3C assays with 107 βTC3 cells were performed in a similar fashion with a few exceptions. Cross-linking was performed in 1% formaldehyde on adherent cells in situ, and cells were lysed as described previously (23Tolhuis B. Palstra R.J. Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1453-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). EcoRI digestion was performed overnight, and a 1:4 dilution of digested DNA was used in the ligation reaction. Subsequent PCR analysis of ligated products was performed using the same internal control primers and primers to detect a novel 197-bp product (forward and reverse primers, 5′-TCTGGCATTTATTGTCATGTTAGCA-2′ and 5′-CCCAACAACCCAAGATATGTACCT-3′, respectively). PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. In all cases, sample statistics were calculated using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey post test.RESULTSPdx1 and NeuroD1 Synergistically Transactivate Insulin Gene Transcription—Prior studies have demonstrated that Pdx1 and NeuroD1 (with its heterodimer partner E47) synergistically activate a “minienhancer” of the rat I Ins gene that consists of five tandem repeats of the E2/A3 elements (known as the 5-Far-Flat reporter) (12Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14Glick E. Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2199-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For our studies, we employed cells derived from mouse pancreatic ductal epithelium (mPAC L20) that contain low levels of Pdx1 and no discernible NeuroD1 but are capable of transdifferentiating into β-like cells upon overexpression of NeuroD1 (24Gasa R. Mrejen C. Leachman N. Otten M. Barnes M. Wang J. Chakrabarti S. Mirmira R. German M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13245-13250Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Consistent with prior findings in non-pancreatic cell types, Fig. 1A demonstrates that whereas transient transfection of Pdx1 and NeuroD1 individually activates the 5-Far-Flat reporter ∼16-fold each in mPAC L20 cells, the combination of Pdx1 with NeuroD1 causes a striking 56-fold activation.Given the limitations imposed by the chromatin structure of endogenous genes, we next asked whether the synergistic activation of Ins reporter genes, as presented here, might be applicable to the endogenous Ins gene. As shown in Fig. 1B, transfection of Pdx1 or NeuroD1 caused no significant activation of the endogenous gene in mPAC cells as determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. However, cotransfection of both factors led to a 4.5-fold activation of the gene. Notably, the absolute level of activation of the Ins gene in these cells still remains only a small fraction of that observed in intact islets or β cell lines (∼10–5; data not shown), implying that limitations at the level of chromatin or of expression of other transcription factors/cofactors prevent high-level expression of the gene in these non-β cells. Overexpression of the NeuroD1 heterodimerization partner E47 did not substantially enhance gene activation in these experiments, presumably because sufficient endogenous E47 is present in this cell line.Pdx1 and NeuroD1 Are Required to Fully Activate the Endogenous Insulin Gene in β Cells—To demonstrate that full activity of the endogenous Ins gene in β cells and islets requires actions of Pdx1 and NeuroD1, we next performed siRNA studies in βTC3 cells (a mouse β cell-derived cell line) to diminish Pdx1 and NeuroD1 protein levels. Whereas two different siRNAs (47 and 48) against Pdx1 led to 50–60% reductions in Pdx1 protein with no discernible effect on NeuroD1 protein levels, two siRNAs (78 and 28) against NeuroD1 caused 40–50% reductions in both Pdx1 and NeuroD1 protein levels (Fig. 2, A and B); this latter finding is consistent with prior studies that suggest that maintenance of Pdx1 expression in mature β cells may be dependent upon NeuroD1 (6Naya F.J.

Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2598-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C demonstrates that siRNAs 47 and 48 against Pdx1 result in small but significant 20–30% reductions in Ins mRNA levels; siRNAs 78 and 28 against NeuroD1 result in even greater 90 and 70% reductions, respectively, in Ins mRNA levels. The greater reductions in Ins mRNA levels with siRNAs against NeuroD1 likely result from the combined knockdown of both NeuroD1 and Pdx1 in these cells. Taken together, the data in Fig. 2 suggest that NeuroD1 and Pdx1 are required for full activation of the Ins gene.FIGURE 2The Ins gene activity is dependent upon Pdx1 and NeuroD1. βTC3 β cells were transfected with negative control siRNA (si-Control) and two different siRNA sequences against Pdx1 (si-Pdx1) or NeuroD1 (si-NeuroD1) and harvested after 96 h.

Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14Glick E. Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2199-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine whether the two proteins interact endogenously in a cellular context, we performed coimmunoprecipitation studies using extracts from βTC3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, immunoprecipitation of Pdx1 protein from these extracts using Pdx1 antiserum resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of NeuroD1, a result that was not observed when normal rabbit serum was used instead. These findings suggest that the two proteins are components of an intracellular complex.FIGURE 3Pdx1 and NeuroD1 physically interact with each other. A, extracts from βTC3 cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) using the antiserum against Pdx1 and then subjected to immunoblot (IB) analysis using monoclonal anti-NeuroD1 antibody. B, mPAC L20 cells were cotransfected with the 5-Far-Flat luciferase reporter plasmid and cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression plasmids encoding the indicated fusion proteins. -Fold induction of luciferase activity was calculated as the activity of cells transfected with empty expression vector alone defined as 1. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of five independent transfections. C and D, mPAC L20 cells were transfected with a 2:3 ratio of donor (ECFP-Pdx1 or ECFP-Nkx6.1) to acceptor (EYFP-NeuroD1) expression plasmid as indicated.

To ensure that fluorescent protein fusions of Pdx1 and NeuroD1 remain functional, we first tested the ability of enhanced EGFP-Pdx1 and EGFP-NeuroD1 fusion proteins to activate the 5-Far-Flat minienhancer. As shown in Fig. 3B, both EGFP-Pdx1 and EGFP-NeuroD1 transactivate the minienhancer 3- and 7-fold, respectively, in mPAC L20 cells, and the combination of the two proteins synergistically activates the minienhancer 18-fold. We next used fluorescent protein fusions in FRET studies. FRET measures the transfer of excitation energy from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore over a distance of <7 nm (26Day R.N. Schaufele F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1675-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For these studies, proteins were fused to either ECFP (donor fluorophore) or EYFP (acceptor fluorophore) and transiently transfected into mPAC L20 cells. Each fluorophore-specific image was collected at similar gray-level intensities, and identical conditions were then used to acquire images from doubly-transfected cells using the FRET filter set, this allowed the measurement of the donor and acceptor spectral bleed-through background signals in the FRET channel. In a cell coexpressing ECFP-Pdx1 and EYFP-NeuroD1 (Fig. 3C), the mean gray-level intensity in the corrected FRET image (precision FRET) was 638 units after adjustment for bleed-through with control cells individually expressing ECFP-Pdx1 or EYFP-Neur"
https://openalex.org/W2091998318,"Bcr-Abl oncogene is responsible for the initial phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which is effectively treated by the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib. Over time patients become resistant to treatment and progress to blast crisis, an event that is driven by additional genetic and epigenetic aberrations. Recently, we showed that Riz1 expression decreases in blast crisis and that re-expression of Riz1 inhibits IGF-1 expression. IGF-1 signaling is required in many stages of hematopoiesis and inappropriate activation of autocrine IGF-1 signaling may facilitate transformation to blast crisis. We observed that in 8 out of 11 matched CML patient biopsies the IGF-1 expression is elevated in blast crisis. We examined mechanisms used by CML blast crisis cell lines to activate IGF-1 expression. We found that Bcr-Abl activates autocrine IGF-1 signaling using Hck and Stat5b. Inhibition of these signaling components using small molecule drugs or shRNA decreases proliferation and enhances apoptosis. Together, our study suggests that aberrant IGF-1 signaling is an important event in blast crisis transformation and it provides a mechanism to explain the activity of IGF-1R and Hck inhibitors in blocking CML blast crisis phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1969382892,"Relative little attention has been devoted until now to the combined effects of gene polymorphisms of the hemostatic pathway as risk factors for Myocardial Infarction (MI), the main thrombotic complication of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of ten common prothrombotic polymorphisms as a determinant of MI.We studied a total of 804 subjects, 489 of whom with angiographically proven severe CAD, with or without MI (n = 307; n = 182; respectively). An additive model considering ten common polymorphisms [Prothrombin 20210G>A, PAI-1 4G/5G, Fibrinogen beta -455G>A, FV Leiden and ""R2"", FVII -402G>A and -323 del/ins, Platelet ADP Receptor P2Y12 -744T>C, Platelet Glycoproteins Ia (873G>A), and IIIa (1565T>C)] was tested. The prevalence of MI increased linearly with an increasing number of unfavorable alleles (chi(2) for trend = 10.68; P = 0.001). In a multiple logistic regression model, the number of unfavorable alleles remained significantly associated with MI after adjustment for classical risk factors. As compared to subjects with 3-7 alleles, those with few (</=2) alleles had a decreased MI risk (OR 0.34, 95%CIs 0.13-0.93), while those with more (>/=8) alleles had an increased MI risk (OR 2.49, 95%CIs 1.03-6.01). The number of procoagulant alleles correlated directly (r = 0.49, P = 0.006) with endogenous thrombin potential.The combination of prothrombotic polymorphisms may help to predict MI in patients with advanced CAD."

However, the functional relevance of these proteins in the biology of this organism remains largely obscure. On the basis of computational, biochemical, and gene expression studies, we propose that the multifunctional Dictyostelium PKS (DiPKS) protein DiPKS1 could be involved in the biosynthesis of the differentiation regulating factor 4-methyl-5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol (MPBD). Our cell-free reconstitution studies of a novel acyl carrier protein Type III PKS didomain from DiPKS1 revealed a crucial role of protein-protein interactions in determining the final biosynthetic product. Whereas the Type III PKS domain by itself primarily produces acyl pyrones, the presence of the interacting acyl carrier protein domain modulates the catalytic activity to produce the alkyl resorcinol scaffold of MPBD. Furthermore, we have characterized an O-methyltransferase (OMT12) from Dictyostelium with the capability to modify this resorcinol ring to synthesize a variant of MPBD. We propose that such a modification in vivo could in fact provide subtle variations in biological function and specificity. In addition, we have performed systematic computational analysis of 45 multidomain PKSs, which revealed several unique features in DiPKS proteins. Our studies provide a new perspective in understanding mechanisms by which metabolic diversity could be generated by combining existing functional scaffolds.

We propose that such a modification in vivo could in fact provide subtle variations in biological function and specificity. In addition, we have performed systematic computational analysis of 45 multidomain PKSs, which revealed several unique features in DiPKS proteins. Our studies provide a new perspective in understanding mechanisms by which metabolic diversity could be generated by combining existing functional scaffolds. The soil-dwelling Dictyostelium discoideum genome has revealed an unanticipated variety of genes involved in the biosynthesis of natural products. Several metabolites have already been isolated, including a family of differentiation-inducing factors (DIFs), 3The abbreviations used are: DIF, differentiation-inducing factor; MPBD, 4-methyl-5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol; PKS, polyketide synthase; OMT, O-methyltransferase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; DiPKS, Dictyostelium polyketide synthase; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; RT, reverse transcription; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 4-methyl-5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol (MPBD), discadenine, and dictyopyrones (Fig. 1) (1Serafimidis I.

Dictyostelium is a unique organism that shows an exceptional two-stage life cycle, which alternates between unicellular ameboid and multicellular fruiting body stages (9Weijer C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Shaulsky G. Kessin R.H. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: R684-R692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Remarkable studies over the years have demonstrated that differentiation, spatial patterning, and morphogenesis are controlled by a combination of cell-autonomous mechanisms and intercellular signaling through a variety of chemotactic small molecules and growth-regulating metabolites (11Strmecki L. Greene D.M. Pears C.J. Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the inventory of such molecules is growing, the molecular components of the biosynthetic machinery have not been elucidated. Dictyostelium possesses a large abundance of genes homologous to polyketide synthases (PKSs), which are known to produce an array of secondary metabolites (12Eichinger L. Pachebat J.A. Glockner G.

Biol. 2006; 346: 15-30PubMed Google Scholar). Several homologs of O-methyltransferases (OMTs) and acyl-CoA synthetases can also be detected in the genome. PKSs are a family of multifunctional proteins that produce metabolites through sequential condensation of small carboxylic acid thioesters (14Cane D.E. Walsh C.T. Khosla C. Science. 1998; 282: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 15Khosla C. Tang Y. Chen A.Y. Schnarr N.A. Cane D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These have been categorized into Type I–III subfamilies based on protein architecture. Type I PKSs consist of multiple catalytic domains sequestered on a polypeptide chain. Modular PKSs possess many such modules that are used once during biosynthesis, whereas iterative enzymes utilize the same set of enzymes repetitively during the biosynthesis. Type II PKSs consist of discrete proteins that form a noncovalent multienzyme complex. Type III PKSs are structurally and mechanistically quite distinct from the other two subfamily members and do not possess an acyl carrier protein (ACP)-bound phosphopantetheine arm for anchoring the intermediates (16Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed tremendous versatility of PKSs in terms of their structural and functional organization as well as their ability to produce compounds other than typical secondary metabolites (17Gokhale R.S. Sankaranarayanan R. Mohanty M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Gokhale R.S. Saxena P. Chopra T. Mohanty D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2007; 24: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although PKSs have been implicated in the biosynthesis of development-regulating factors in Dictyostelium, the enzymatic machinery involved in their biosynthesis has not been identified. Recent elegant studies with a Type I-Type III PKS protein showed involvement in the biosynthesis of DIF-1 by a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches (19Austin M.B. Saito T. Bowman M.E. Haydock S. Kato A. Moore B.S. Kay R.R. Noel J.P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Sankaranarayanan R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of the other 44 multifunctional PKSs in the biology of Dictyostelium is unclear. In this study, we report the comprehensive analysis of D. discoideum PKS proteins that show distinct homology to fungal PKSs. We propose to name these Dictyostelium PKS (DiPKS) proteins DiPKS1–45 based on the order in which they appear in the genome. Our studies reveal several unique features associated with these large PKSs, including the presence of C-methyltransferase domains and novel reductase domains fused at the C-terminal ends of several multifunctional PKS proteins. The two PKS proteins DiPKS1 and DiPKS37, which were referred to previously as Steely1 and Steely2, respectively (19Austin M.B. Saito T. Bowman M.E. Haydock S. Kato A. Moore B.S. Kay R.R. Noel J.P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), contain a Type III PKS domain fused at the C-terminal end. We show that an engineered ACP Type III PKS didomain from DiPKS1 efficiently catalyzed synthesis of the demethyl analog of MPBD. This is in contrast to a previous report wherein the DiPKS1 Type III PKS domain by itself was shown to produce acyl pyrones (19Austin M.B. Saito T. Bowman M.E. Haydock S. Kato A. Moore B.S. Kay R.R. Noel J.P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Functional characterization of the didomain emphasized the significance of protein-protein interactions in dictating biosynthesis of the final product. On the basis of the cell-free reconstitution studies and our understanding of the programming of the fungal Type I iterative PKSs, we propose that DiPKS1 may be involved in the biosynthesis of the resorcinolic metabolite MPBD. Furthermore, we have characterized an O-methyltransferase that methylates the hydroxyl group on the resorcinolic scaffold, which could produce new analogs of MPBD and thus generate functional diversity in vivo. Materials—Genomic DNA from D. discoideum was isolated from the AX2 strain. [2-14C]Malonyl-CoA (58.40 mCi/mmol) and S-[methyl-14C]Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet; 51.4 mCi/mmol) was procured from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and nonradioactive acyl-CoA starter substrates (phloroglucinol, resorcinol, olivetol, and catechol) were purchased from Sigma. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The Type III PKS domains of dipks1 (GenBank™ accession number DDB0234164) and dipks37 (accession number DDB0234163) and the ACP Type III PKS didomain from DiPKS1 were amplified using gene-specific primers and cloned into pBluescript SK+. For N-terminally His6-tagged protein expression, these genes were cloned into pET28a and expressed in the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli at 18 °C using 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The omt12 gene (GenBank™ accession number DDB0229899) was cloned into the Topo-D vector after PCR amplification and then into pET43.1a for expression as an N-terminally Nus- and His-tagged protein at 22 °C using 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. These proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. However, because of very low expression, the DiPKS37 Type III PKS domain could not be purified to homogeneity. The ACP Type III PKS didomain could be eluted only from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column in buffer containing 100 mm imidazole and 25% glycerol along with 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol. The identity of all three proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Enzymatic Assay and Product Characterization Using Mass Spectrometry—The enzymatic assays of the ACP Type III PKS domain of DiPKS1 and Type III PKS domains of DiPKS1 and DiPKS37 were performed as described (21Saxena P. Yadav G. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44780-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the reaction products were resolved on reverse phase columns (Phenomenex) using a linear gradient of 30% CH3CN in H2O (with 2% formic acid) to 100% CH3CN over 40 min. For the OMT assay, 100 μm substrate and 50 μm AdoMet inclusive of 15 μm [methyl-14C]AdoMet (51.4 mCi/mmol) were used. The reaction was carried out at 22 °C for 4 h and quenched with 5% acetic acid. Products of OMT12 were extracted with 2× 300 μl of ethyl acetate and dried under vacuum before being resolved on TLC plates in chloroform/methanol/water (70:26:4, v/v/v). Reaction products of OMT12 were resolved on reverse phase columns using a linear gradient of 5% CH3CN in H2O (with 0.1% formic acid) to 100% CH3CN over 30 min. All the polyketide products were characterized using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Determination of Kinetic Parameters—Reactions were carried out with 44 μg of protein and varied (0.5–400 μm) starter molecule concentrations. Products were extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed by radio-TLC. Resolved radiolabeled products were quantified using a Fuji FLA-5000 phosphoimaging system. dipks1 Gene Expression by Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Dictyostelium strain AX2 was grown in HL-5 medium at 22 °C. After synchronization, cells were collected starting from 0 to 24 h. RNA extraction was carried out with TRIzol (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using an Invitrogen kit with an oligo(dT) primer, and PCR was performed for the dipks1 gene using primers TCATTCGTTTTGGGTATTGGT and TTAGACAACATTTTTTAAGAAACA. Results were normalized to the transcripts of constitutive gene IG7. Bioinformatic Analysis—The sequences of various PKSs of D. discoideum were downloaded from dictyBase (22Chisholm R.L. Gaudet P. Just E.M. Pilcher K.E. Fey P. Merchant S.N. Kibbe W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D423-D427Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The catalytic domains of the PKSs were identified using the NRPS-PKS Database (23Ansari M.Z. Yadav G. Gokhale R.S. Mohanty D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W405-W413Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). All pairwise alignments were carried out using BLAST at NCBI and SEQWEB for generating multiple alignments and dendrograms. The structure coordinates were obtained from the Protein Data Bank; ACP of E. coli (code 1t8k) and the Type III PKS domain of DiPKS1 (code 2h84) were used to construct a theoretical model of their binary complex using the 3D-Dock program suite (24Gabb H.A. Jackson R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) and compared with the CoA-bound crystal structure of chalcone synthase (code 1bq6). Computational Analysis of Polyketide Synthases from Dictyostelium—Comprehensive sequence analysis of the D. discoideum genome revealed 45 large multidomain PKS proteins with >2000 amino acids. For simplicity, we propose to annotate them as DiPKS1–45 based on the order in which they appear in the genome. Phylogenetic investigation suggested four members to be significantly different from other PKS proteins (supplemental Fig. S1). These include the two hybrid Type I-Type III PKSs DiPKS1 and DiPKS37 (referred to previously as Steely1 and Steely2, respectively) (19Austin M.B. Saito T. Bowman M.E. Haydock S. Kato A. Moore B.S. Kay R.R. Noel J.P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and DiPKS16 and DiPKS17. The latter two are closely related proteins and are probable fatty-acid synthases. Computational analysis of DiPKS proteins using the NRPS-PKS Database facilitated precise identification of various catalytic domains (supplemental Table S1) (23Ansari M.Z. Yadav G. Gokhale R.S. Mohanty D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W405-W413Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). DiPKS4, DiPKS11, DiPKS12, and DiPKS20 are probably pseudogenes with truncated domains. The other 41 proteins contain the functional units of β-ketoacyl synthase, ACP, and acyltransferase. A careful investigation of the active-site signature motif suggested that these acyltransferase domains would utilize malonate extender units (25Yadav G. Gokhale R.S. Mohanty D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Methyl branching in fungal metabolites has been suggested to be derived from the C-methyltransferase domain (26Cox R.J. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2007; 5: 2010-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Systematic analyses revealed the presence of methyltransferase domains in 30 of these PKSs (supplemental Table S2), all of which show good conservation in the four sequence motifs of the methyltransferase domains (27Faunam, E. B., Blumenthal, R. M., and Cheng, X. (1999) in S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions (Cheng, X., and Blumenthal, R. M., eds) pp. 1-38, World Scientific Publishing, Co., Inc., Hackensack, NJGoogle Scholar). Dendrogram clustering studies with other functionally characterized C-, N-, and O-methyltransferases indeed showed that all of these domains belong to the C-methyltransferase family (Fig. 2). Several PKSs show an unusually long C terminus-coding sequence after the ACP domain. Analysis of these C-terminal regions suggested the presence of a NAD-dependent reductase domain in 18 of these PKS proteins. Such domains in nonribosomal peptide synthases have been shown to catalyze reductive release of products (28Kopp F. Mahlert C. Grunewald J. Marahiel M.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 16478-16479Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Schracke N. Linne U. Mahlert C.

A. 2001; 98: 11136-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The C termini of DiPKS1 and DiPKS37 revealed an unprecedented Type III PKS domain. Type III PKS proteins have been characterized mostly in plants and bacteria (16Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 31Funa N. Ozawa H. Hirata A. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6356-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and have been recently reported in fungi (32Funa N. Awakawa T. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The identification of unique features in DiPKS proteins prompted us to investigate their functional role to understand their importance in the biology of Dictyostelium. Characterization of Dictyostelium Type III PKSs—As an initial approach, we decided to elucidate the functions of DiPKS1 and DiPKS37 by reconstituting C-terminal Type III PKS domains. Type III PKS proteins from bacterial systems are known to produce phloroglucinol and resorcinol rings, which are scaffolds of DIF-1 and MPBD (Fig. 3A). These domains were expressed with N-terminal hexahistidine affinity tags in E. coli, and the protein identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Radio-TLC assays performed using [2-14C]malonyl-CoA and a variety of starter units showed activity with aliphatic acyl-CoAs, but not with plant-specific acyl-CoA substrates. Enzymatic assays with DiPKS37 and DiPKS1 Type III PKS domains showed three radioactive products with Rf values of 0.79, 0.67, and 0.88 using hexanoyl-CoA as a starter substrate (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). The product formed by the DiPKS37 Type III PKS domain was characterized by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) and was determined similarly as described in the work published during the course of our study by Noel and co-workers (19Austin M.B. Saito T. Bowman M.E. Haydock S. Kato A. Moore B.S. Kay R.R. Noel J.P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the products formed by Type III PKS of DiPKS1 were contrary to those in this earlier study and instead showed two distinct radioactive products (products b and c) (Fig. 3B, lane 2). The radioactive product b could be characterized by comparing the product profile with previously characterized PKS18 protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4) (21Saxena P. Yadav G. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44780-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Sankaranarayanan R. Saxena P. Marathe U.B. Gokhale R.S. Shanmugam V.M. Rukmini R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis confirmed this to be a triketide pyrone with a molecular ion peak of [M - H]-1 at m/z 181.09 (Fig. 3, C and D). The other major product of DiPKS1 Type III PKS migrating with an Rf of 0.88 was subsequently purified by HPLC (product c) (Fig. 3C) and subjected to structural analysis. A molecular ion peak of [M - H]-1 at m/z 179.12 was obtained, which, upon further tandem mass spectrometry analysis, yielded fragments at m/z 137.11 and 135.13 (Fig. 3E). This fragmentation pattern of M - 42 and M - 44 has been described recently for alkyl resorcinolic compounds (31Funa N. Ozawa H. Hirata A. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6356-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This product was unambiguously confirmed by comparison with standard 5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol (also known as olivetol) (supplemental Fig. S2C). Our studies thus demonstrate that the hexanoyl-primed DiPKS1 Type III PKS can catalyze three polyketide chain extensions followed by aldol cyclization to synthesize demethyl-MPBD. Kinetic Studies of the DiPKS1 Type III PKS Protein—The DiPKS1 Type III PKS domain showed promiscuous starter unit specificity and synthesized products in significant amounts with small-, medium-, and long-chain acyl-CoA starter substrates ranging from C3 to C20 (supplemental Fig. S2D). Kinetic analysis showed typical saturation kinetics, and the specificity of the protein for medium- to long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs was estimated from the Km values (Table 1). Resorcinolic products were observed for hexanoyl-, octanoyl-, and decanoyl-CoA starter units. Intriguingly, longer chain substrates could synthesize only pyrone products, albeit with favorable profiles of lower Km and higher kcat values. Because Type III PKS enzymes are known to produce acyl pyrone derailment products under nonoptimal assay conditions (16Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), kinetic specificity for long-chain substrates may not reflect the true in vivo biological function. Another distinct possibility for incomplete resorcinol synthesis could be the suboptimal folding of the engineered 362-amino acid Type III PKS domain, which is fused at the end of a large DiPKS1 protein (3148 amino acids). Computational analysis suggested that the Type III PKS domain is connected to the ACP domain through a 134-amino acid intragenic linker region. Considering the fact that interdomain interaction often helps in attaining native conformation of the protein (15Khosla C. Tang Y. Chen A.Y. Schnarr N.A. Cane D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), we decided to characterize the ACP Type III PKS didomain protein for its capability to synthesize polyketide products.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters for the DiPKS1 Type III PKS protein with different starter units Results are the means (n = 3) with S.E. values <15%.

Comparative analysis of the enzymatic activity in the didomain protein and the Type III PKS domain showed distinctive differences (Fig. 4, A and B). The didomain protein efficiently catalyzed biosynthesis of alkyl resorcinol, and almost no acyl pyrones could be detected in these in vitro assays (supplemental Table S3). We argued that the interactions between ACP and the Type III PKS domain may be crucial for optimal functioning of the DiPKS1 protein. Because Type III PKSs typically exist as independent proteins, we further investigated the interactions that may be crucial during enzymatic catalysis. A homology model was built for the ACP domain using the crystal structure (code 1t8k) as a template, and the modeled ACP structure was docked onto the available crystal structure (code 2h84) of the DiPKS1 Type III PKS domain (19Austin M.B. Saito T. Bowman M.E. Haydock S. Kato A. Moore B.S. Kay R.R. Noel J.P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the biologically meaningful complexes of ACP Type III PKS, the phosphopantetheine group attached to the catalytic Ser must reach the catalytic Cys of Type III PKS. We therefore selected complexes in which the catalytic Ser was within 6 Å of the residues lining the mouth of the CoA-binding tunnel of Type III PKS. Fig. 5C shows a structural model for interaction between ACP and the Type III PKS domain of DiPKS1. Analysis of this complex suggested two potential electrostatic interactions, ACP Lys2612-Type III PKS Glu2829 and ACP Ser2613-Type III PKS Arg2826, that could stabilize this complex. A similar constrained docking approach successfully identified residues involved in interaction between mycocerosic acid synthase and PapA5 (34Trivedi O.A. Arora P. Vats A. Ansari M.Z. Tickoo R. Sridharan V. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 631-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To examine the importance of these predicted residues, we performed site-directed mutagenesis. However, these mutant proteins could not be expressed in the soluble form and thus precluded any further functional analysis. Stage-specific Expression of dipks1 in Dictyostelium—The Dictyostelium life cycle starts with the unicellular ameboid stage. Upon starvation, these solitary amebas enter a multicellular developmental program in which they start aggregating into mounds and differentiate into prespore and prestalk cells. These aggregates are enveloped in acellular sheaths, forming slugs, which finally develop into fruiting bodies. MPBD has been isolated previously from these later developmental stages (2Saito T. Taylor G.W. Yang J.C. Neuhaus D. Stetsenko D. Kato A. Kay R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A recent study has suggested, however, that dipks1 is expressed in the early stages of Dictyostelium development (19Austin M.B. Saito T. Bowman M.E. Haydock S. Kato A. Moore B.S. Kay R.R. Noel J.P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which does not corroborate our in vitro studies. We therefore decided to probe the expression of dipks1 at different stages of Dictyostelium development using RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5D, dipks1 was found to be expressed primarily at 18 h of the developmental process. A low level of transcript could also be detected at 22 h, which provides credence to our proposition that DiPKS1 is involved in MPBD biosynthesis. Dictyostelium O-Methyltransferase as a Post-DiPKS1-processing Enzyme—The Dictyostelium genome contains 12 potential OMTs (named as OMT1–12), listed in supplemental Table S4. Because a possible modification of resorcinol rings would involve O-methylation, we investigated whether any of these OMTs could modify MPBD. Computational analysis of Dictyostelium OMTs suggested a distinct homology for the OMT12 protein to the resorcinol-modifying enzyme SbOMT3 from Sorghum bicolor (35Baerson S.R. Dayan F.E. Rimando A.M. Nanayakkara N.P. Liu C.-J. Schröder J. Fishbein M. Pan Z. Kagan I.A. Pratt L.H. Cordonnier-Pratt M.-M. Duke S.O. J. Biol.

Bot. 2007; 58: 3263-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). OMT7 and OMT8 also showed reasonable homology to SbOMT3; however, OMT8 (referred to previously as DmtA) has been demonstrated to modify the phloroglucinol ring of DIF-1 (37Thompson C.R. Kay R.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1509-1514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We cloned and expressed OMT12 and investigated its functional activity with substrates such as phloroglucinol, catechol, and resorcinol (Fig. 5A). [14C]AdoMet was used as methyl donor, revealing a major radioactive product with resorcinol. This product was purified by HPLC and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 5B). A molecular ion peak of [M - H]-1 at m/z 123.04 was obtained, which, upon further tandem mass spectrometry analysis, yielded expected fragments at m/z 108.02, 95.01, and 80.03, confirming formation of 3-methoxyphenol (Fig. 5C). OMT12 also showed good activity with the alkyl resorcinol product of DiPKS1. In situ coupled assays involving DiPKS1 Type III PKS and OMT12 indeed confirmed formation of the new product, 3-methoxypentylphenol (Fig. 5D). The Dictyostelium genome has revealed a large number of genes homologous to PKSs and post-PKS-processing enzymes. The advances in the understanding of the biochemical basis for the programming of polyketide biosynthesis provide an impetus and opportunity to dissect the roles of such enzymes from these versatile soil amoebas. In this work, we have characterized the catalytic function of the DiPKS1 protein by a combination of computational, biochemical, and gene expression studies. We propose that the DiPKS1 protein is involved in the biosynthesis of the differentiation regulating factor MPBD. In a previous study, the functional role of DiPKS1 could not be ascertained, and the Type III PKS domain was shown to produce acyl pyrones (19Austin M.B. Saito T. Bowman M.E. Haydock S. Kato A. Moore B.S. Kay R.R. Noel J.P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this study, we performed enzymatic assays with a novel ACP Type III PKS didomain of DiPKS1, which catalyzes three rounds of chain extensions with a hexanoyl-CoA starter unit followed by aldol cyclization to release the demethyl analog of MPBD. Our studies reveal the crucial role of protein-protein interactions in determining the final biosynthetic product. MPBD has been isolated previously from fruiting bodies in the late stages of Dictyostelium development and has been suggested to have a polyketide origin based on cerulenin inhibition experiments (2Saito T. Taylor G.W. Yang J.C. Neuhaus D. Stetsenko D. Kato A. Kay R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our RT-PCR analysis of dipks1 demonstrated that this gene is expressed in the later stages of development. This is contrary to the previous study, in which DiPKS1 was instead found to be expressed at 4 h of development (19Austin M.B. Saito T. Bowman M.E. Haydock S. Kato A. Moore B.S. Kay R.R. Noel J.P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We believe that this discrepancy in expression profile studies may have originated from the wrong choice of primers used for RT-PCR analysis. The previous study used primers from the β-ketoacyl synthase region, which is the most homologous domain among all PKS proteins. We performed these experiments using primers designed based on the Type III PKS domain. The polyketide metabolites often undergo secondary modifications by various tailoring enzymes, thereby enhancing their functionality to yield many bioactive compounds. Such post-PKS processing has been proposed in DIF-1 in Dictyostelium, where the chlorinating and OMT enzymes produce a group of closely related DIF-1 analogs (4Morris H.R. Masento M.S. Taylor G.W. Jermyn K.A. Kay R.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Thompson C.R. Kay R.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1509-1514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized an OMT that shows the capability to modify the alkyl resorcinol ring to synthesize a variant of MPBD. We propose that such a modification in vivo could in fact provide subtle variations in terms of biological functions and specificity. Our systematic analyses of multifunctional PKS proteins provide a basis to describe the biosynthetic pathway for MPBD and DIF-1 metabolites. We propose that both DiPKS1 and DiPKS37 proteins resemble fungal Type I iterative PKSs and utilize the β-keto reductive domains in a precisely programmed mechanism (Fig. 6). The Type I PKS from both DiPKS1 and DiPKS37 would perform two rounds of iterative condensation of malonyl-CoA using acetyl-CoA as a starter unit. In these two rounds, all three β-keto reductive domains would be utilized to produce ACP/S-hexanoyl thioester. In the case of DiPKS37, the acyl chain is then transferred to the Type III PKS domain to catalyze three rounds of C2 unit condensation and cyclization to produce a trihydroxyphenylhexanone intermediate. This further undergoes post-PKS halogenations and O-methylation to produce DIF-1. DiPKS1 instead would undergo another round of iterative nonreducing condensation followed by C-methylation of the polyketide chain by a C-methyltransferase domain. The β-ketoacyl-ACP chain would be then transferred to the Type III PKS domain, which would carry out two more condensation steps followed by aldol-type cyclization to produce MPBD. The transfer of acyl chains directly from the ACP domain to Type III PKS is uncommon. Two other examples of utilization of ACP/thioester substrates by Type III PKS were reported recently in Streptomyces coelicolor (38Song L. Barona-Gomez F. Corre C. Xiang L. Udwary D.W. Austin M.B.

ChemBioChem. 2007; 8: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our study presents a new perspective of understanding the functional role of PKSs in producing signaling molecules, which may be crucial in the orchestration of the developmental stages in the life cycle of Dictyostelium.

We tested the hypothesis of changing HIV-1 virulence by examining trends in prognostic clinical markers of disease progression from 1984 to 2005 among nearly 400 antiretroviral-naïve participants in the United States Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longitudinal study of HIV infection in men who have sex with men (MSM). Methodology/Principal Findings Because clinical AIDS endpoints could not be used (due to antiretroviral therapies and prophylaxis), three prognostic markers of disease progression were used as proxies for HIV-1 virulence: plasma viral RNA load and CD4+ T cell count at “set point” (between ∼9 and ∼15 months after seroconversion), and rate of CD4 cell decline within three years after seroconversion. We performed multivariate analyses of the association between these markers and seroconversion year, with covariates including MACS site, race/ethnic group, seroconversion age, and CCR5Δ32 status. No statistically significant association was found between year of seroconversion and “set point” plasma viral load (at ∼9 months after seroconversion: slope = −0.004 log10 copies/mL/year, p = 0.76; at ∼15 months: slope = −0.005 log10 copies/mL/year, p = 0.71), CD4 cell count after seroconversion (at ∼9 months: slope = −0.112 cells/µL/year, p = 0.22; at ∼15 months: slope = −0.047 cells/µL/year, p = 0.64), or rate of CD4 cell decline over the first three years after seroconversion (slope = −0.010 cells/ul/yr2, p = 0.88). Conclusions/Significance The lack of significant trends from 1984 to 2005 in these prognostic markers of HIV disease progression suggests no major change in HIV-1 virulence over the AIDS pandemic in MSM in the US."

Native MVs have been shown to contain a nucleational core responsible for mineral formation that is comprised of Mg2+-containing amorphous calcium phosphate and lipid-calcium-phosphate complexes (CPLXs) and the lipid-dependent Ca2+-binding proteins, especially annexin-5 (Anx-5), which greatly enhances mineral formation.

In this study, nucleators based on amorphous calcium phosphate (with or without Anx-5) were prepared with PS alone, PS + phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), or PS + PE and other MV lipids. These were incubated in synthetic cartilage lymph containing no collagen or containing type II or type X collagen. Dilution of PS with PE and other MV lipids progressively retarded nucleation. Incorporation of Anx-5 restored nucleational activity to the PS:PE CPLX; thus PS and Anx-5 proved to be critical for nucleation of mineral. Without Anx-5, induction of mineral formation was slow unless high levels of Ca2+ were used. The presence of type II collagen in synthetic cartilage lymph improved both the rate and amount of mineral formation but did not enhance nucleation.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5126-5133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, PS becomes complexed with the newly forming mineral, and its levels increase, apparently at the expense of PE by base-exchange with free serine (49Wuthier R.E. Wians Jr., F.H. Giancola M.S. Dragic S.S. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1431-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These findings point to a dynamic role of lipids in mineral formation by MVs and have led us to carefully examine the effect that lipids have on the mineral-forming activity of synthetic models of the nucleational core. Here we focus on the effects that specific MV lipids have on mineral formation, as well as the modulating influences of the cartilage-specific collagen. To mimic the complex ionic environment that occurs during MV formation in vivo (44Wuthier R.E. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1977; 23: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), for construction of these biomimetic complexes we used an intracellular phosphate buffer (ICP) (50Wuthier R.E. Rice G.S.

Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with an electrolyte content similar to that of ultrafiltrates of lysates of isolated growth plate chondrocytes. Endochondral calcification occurs in an environment rich in proteoglycans and the cartilage-specific collagens. Although both macromolecules undoubtedly influence the propagation of mineral from the MVs, in this study the effects of type II and X collagen on mineral formation by the synthetic complexes were studied because they are known to bind to MV (51Wu L.N.

Synthesis of ACP, CPLX, and Anx-A5-containing Complexes—4× stock emulsions of various lipid mixtures were prepared by drying a total of 5 mg of lipid in chloroform under N2 to form a thin film in a test tube. Then 2 ml of an inorganic phosphate (Pi)-rich intracellular phosphate buffer (ICP buffer) was added. ICP buffer contained 106.7 mm K+, 45.1 mm Na+, and 1.5 mm Mg2+, 115.7 mm Cl-, 23.0 mm Pi, 10 mm HCO-3, and 1.5 mm SO2-4, with 3.1 mm N-3 as a preservative; its total molarity = 153.3 mm and its pH = 7.2 (50Wuthier R.E. Rice G.S. Wallace Jr., J.E. Weaver R.L. LeGeros R.Z. Eanes E.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The tube was then sonicated for 3–4 min at 25 °C in a water bath to form a uniform emulsion. To make ∼300 μl of the various CPLXs, 75 μl of the 4× lipid stock emulsion was mixed with 225 μl of ICP buffer. Then either 6 or 12 μl of 100 mm CaCl2 (2 or 4 mm Ca2+, total final concentration, respectively) was added dropwise with rapid stirring over a 5–10-min period to form the various insoluble lipid CPLXs. These were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at ∼15,000 × g. In a previous report we studied the effects of several MV annexins on mineral formation by biomimetic nucleational complexes. We found that all of the tested purified native human (Anx-H5) and avian annexin-A5 (Anx-A5) samples strongly stimulated mineral formation by PS-CPLX (45Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26035-26045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For this study, we used both native chicken liver Anx-A5 and native human placental Anx-H5, which had comparable activity. They were purified to >98% as described previously (17Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10917-10921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol.

Samples (50–75 μg) of the Anx-5 isolates in ICP buffer were added to 75 μl of the 4× lipid stock solution. The final volume was adjusted to 300 μl with ICP buffer; then an aliquot of 100 mm CaCl2 was added to precipitate the complex, which was harvested as described above. The resultant complexes were assayed for mineralization activity. Protein levels were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (57Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, lipids were omitted, and the 100 mm CaCl2 stock was added dropwise into the ICP buffer with rapid stirring over a 5–10-min period to form amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP). As a further control, the purified native Anx-A5 was prepared in the ICP buffer without lipids; CaCl2 was then added to form the Anx-A5-ACP complex, which was similarly harvested by centrifugation. Lipids—Synthetic phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL, and included 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC), -phosphoethanolamine (PE), and 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-l-serine (PS). The nonpolar lipids were from Sigma and included free cholesterol (5-cholesten-3-ol, CH) and cholesterol oleate (5-cholesten-3β-ol 3-oleate). Using methods just described, various lipid-Ca2+-Pi CPLXs were formed from either PS alone, PS and PE in equimolar amounts, or from equimolar amounts of PS, PE, PC, CH, and CHE, the latter mimicking the lipid composition of MV (47Genge B.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5126-5133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Collagens—Intact, native collagens were isolated from chicken sternal cartilage (type II) and cultured growth plate chondrocytes (type X) as described previously (58Miller E.J. Rhodes R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 59Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol.

These collagens were dialyzed against SCL and their levels measured by SDS-PAGE. Their purity is shown in Fig. 1. Pepsinized type II collagen was isolated by the method of Miller and Rhodes (58Miller E.J. Rhodes R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) from pepsin digests of minced avian sternal tissue. Matrix Vesicles—Nucleationally competent MV were isolated from chicken growth plate cartilage as described previously (61Genge B.R. Sauer G.R. Wu L.N. McLean F.M. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18513-18519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mineralization Assay—Mineral formation was studied by incubating the various nucleational complexes in SCL, which contained 2 mm Ca2+ and 1.42 mm Pi in addition to 104.5 mm Na+, 133.5 mm Cl-, 63.5 mm sucrose, 16.5 mm TES, 12.7 mm K, 5.55 mm glucose, 1.83 mm HCO-3, and 0.57 mm magnesium sulfate (44Wuthier R.E. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1977; 23: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mineral formation was monitored by light scattering (62Brecevic L. Furedi-Milhofer H. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1972; 10: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using a multiwell microplate assay system described previously by Wu et al. (41Wu L.N. Genge B.R. Dunkelberger D.G.

J. Inorg. Biochem. 2003; 94: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using this method, an increase in absorbance of 0.1 at 340 nm is roughly equivalent to precipitation of ∼10% of the total Ca2+ in the SCL. In brief, following centrifugation of the CPLX-forming (and ACP-forming) reaction mixtures (see above), the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of SCL by brief sonication to yield uniform suspensions. Quadruplicate samples (140 μl) from each 1-ml suspension were distributed into 4 wells of a 96-well half-area Costar microplate; turbidity measurements were made at 340 nm and recorded automatically at 15-min intervals for 12–16 h at 37 °C using a Labsystems iEMS Reader MF microplate reader (Needham Heights, MA). The kinetics of mineral formation was analyzed in detail using five-parameter logistic fit functions (45Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26035-26045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 46Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Wuthier R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of the various lipid components on the time needed for induction (nucleation) of mineral formation, as well as on the rate and amount of mineral formation at different stages during the mineral forming process. X-Ray Diffraction Analysis—To further demonstrate that the increase in light scattering represented true mineral formation, samples of matrix vesicles and human Anx-H5-containing synthetic PS-CPLX, before and after incubation in SCL for 16 h to enable mineral formation, were analyzed by powder x-ray diffraction. These samples were sedimented by centrifugation and washed twice with 10 mm NH4HCO3, a volatile salt to eliminate residual nonvolatile salts from the samples. NH4HCO3 itself was eliminated by repeated drying under dry N2 gas. Equivalent amounts of the dry, salt-free samples were mounted in deep-well glass slides and analyzed by x-ray diffraction using a Rigaku DMax 2100 x-ray diffractometer using CuKα radiation. Data were collected from 5 to 45° 2θ with steps of 0.050° with a count time of 2.0 s per step and a scan speed of 1.5° per min. Effect of Cartilage-specific Collagens—Although type II collagen is the predominant form in most cartilages, type X collagen is specifically localized to the pericellular domain of hypertrophic growth plate cartilage where mineralization is occurring (64Schmid T.M. Popp R.G. Linsenmayer T.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 65Schmid T.M. Bonen D.K. Luchene L. Linsenmayer T.F.

Both collagens have been shown to bind to Anx-A5 in MVs (15Wu L.N. Genge B.R. Lloyd G.C. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1195-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Kirsch T. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11462-11469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that 20 μg of native type II collagen added per ml of SCL stimulated mineralization of Anx-A5-containing PS-CPLX (46Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Wuthier R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of these two collagens on mineral formation by the synthetic nucleational complexes. The response to addition of 10- and 30-μg levels of type II collagen to the SCL on mineralization of Anx-A5-containing PS-CPLX is shown in Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 1. Starting from the base line of the no-collagen controls, type II collagen increased the rate and amount of rapid mineral formation in a linear, dose-dependent manner. It also increased the amount of mineral formed during the slow formation period, as well as the amount formed after 24 h of incubation. There was a general ∼8% increase above basal values for each 10 μg of type II collagen added per ml of SCL. However, collagen did not alter the induction time. When incubated alone in SCL, collagen did not stimulate mineral formation (Fig. 3). Thus, although type II collagen promoted mineral crystal growth induced by the nucleational complex, it did not accelerate onset of mineral formation or, by itself, induce mineral formation in SCL.TABLE 1Dose-response effect of type II collagen in SCL on the nucleation parameters of Anx-A5-containing PS-CPLX For statistical analysis and to assess the effect of the graded levels of collagen, the value of each nucleation parameter was compared with that of the 0 collagen control and analyzed statistically by means of two-tailed Student's t tests, using the homoscedastic test (two populations, equal variance). Values shown are means ± S.E. of the indicated number of samples. Superscripts to the right of the S.E. are the exponential values of the probability that the differences were due to chance. TI indicates the time required to induce mineral formation (h). AMFR indicates the amount of mineral formed during the rapid formation period (A at 340 nm). RMFR indicates the average rate of mineral formation during the rapid formation period (dA/dh) NP indicates the nucleation potential = (RMFR/TI) × 100, a measure of the ability to induce and sustain rapid mineral formation. AMFS indicates the amount of mineral formed during the slow formation period (A at 340 nm). AMF24 h indicates the amount of mineral (A at 340 nm) formed after incubation for 24 h. This was determined by extrapolation using the 5-parameter logistic curve fit equation (see under “Experimental Procedures”).ParameterLevel of type II collagen added per ml of SCL(0 μg)(10 μg)(30 μg)TI (h)3.83 ± 0.113.90 ± 0.043.97 ± 0.12AMFR0.276 ± 0.0100.305 ± 0.012–30.344 ± 0.012–3RMFR0.131 ± 0.0030.143 ± 0.002–20.162 ± 0.003–4NP3.41 ± 0.103.67 ± 0.074.08 ± 0.11–3AMFS0.160 ± 0.0080.170 ± 0.0040.199 ± 0.002–3AMF24 h0.436 ± 0.0060.475 ± 0.008–20.543 ± 0."
https://openalex.org/W1996220021,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia is associated with chromosomal translocations that involve the RARα gene and several distinct loci producing a variety of fusion proteins. One such fusion partner is promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger gene (PLZF), a member of the POK (POZ and Krüppel) family of transcriptional repressors that is a key developmental regulator, stem cell maintenance factor and tumor suppressor. Overexpression of PLZF has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest at the G1 to S transition and repress the expression of key pro-proliferative genes such as CCNA2 and MYC. However, given this data suggesting an important growth inhibitory role for PLZF, relatively little is known regarding regulation of its activity. Here we show that the main cyclin-dependent kinase involved at the G1 to S transition (CDK2) phosphorylates PLZF at two consensus sites found within PEST domains present in the hinge region of the protein. This phosphorylation triggers the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PLZF, which impairs PLZF transcriptional repression ability and antagonizes its growth inhibitory effects. This critical mechanism of PLZF regulation may thus be relevant for cell cycle progression during the development and the pathogenesis of human cancer."

During fibrinolysis, plasminogen is activated to plasmin, which lyses a clot by cleaving fibrin after selected arginine and lysine residues. TAFIa attenuates fibrinolysis by removing the exposed C-terminal lysine residues. It was recently reported that TAFI zymogen possesses sufficient carboxypeptidase activity to attenuate fibrinolysis through a mechanism similar to TAFIa. Here, we show with a recently developed TAFIa assay that when thrombin is used to clot TAFI-deficient plasma supplemented with TAFI, there is some TAFI activation. The extent of activation was dependent upon the concentration of zymogen present in the plasma, and lysis times were prolonged by TAFIa in a concentration-dependent manner. Potato tuber carboxypeptidase inhibitor, an inhibitor of TAFIa but not TAFI, abolished the prolongation of lysis in TAFI-deficient plasma supplemented with TAFI zymogen. In addition, TAFIa but not TAFI catalyzed release of plasminogen bound to soluble fibrin degradation products. The data presented confirm that TAFI zymogen is effective in cleaving a small substrate but does not play a role in the attenuation of fibrinolysis because of its inability to cleave plasmin-modified fibrin degradation products.

Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2183-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). TAFIa is intrinsically unstable, with its inactivation being highly temperature-dependent (15Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The inactivation of TAFIa is thought to be accompanied by a large structural change (16Boffa M.B.

The existence of a TAFIa concentration threshold has been demonstrated, such that TAFIa at a concentration above the threshold inhibits fibrinolysis. Once TAFIa is thermally inactivated and its level falls below the threshold, however, lysis enters the propagation phase (17Leurs J. Nerme V. Sim Y. Hendriks D. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and fibrin is quickly solubilized (17Leurs J. Nerme V. Sim Y. Hendriks D. J. Thromb.

Recently, TAFI zymogen has been shown to have carboxypeptidase activity toward the tetrapeptide PFGK and larger fibrin peptides (20Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Potempa J. Enghild J.J. J. Biol.

Garcia-Saez I. Catasus L. Vendrell J. Coll M. Aviles F.X. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but neither has been shown to cleave macromolecules. Valnickova et al.

J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 5: 1334-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) measured the generation of TAFIa activity during the clotting of human platelet-poor plasma and found that when clotting was initiated with thrombin plus calcium or calcium alone, TAFIa activity increased. They also confirmed that when coagulation was initiated with calcium, lysis was prolonged by the addition of TAFI in a concentration-dependent manner. However, when clotting was initiated with batroxobin, an enzyme that clots fibrinogen but does not activate TAFI, the prolongation of lysis was abolished. Consequently, the authors suggested that any prolongation of lysis is due to TAFIa generated upon the addition of thrombin plus calcium or calcium alone. Valnickova et al. (25Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Potempa J. Enghild J.J. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 5: 1336-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) have rebutted these conclusions by pointing out that the carboxypeptidase activity assay used by Willemse et al. (24Willemse J.L. Heylen E. Hendriks D.F. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 5: 1334-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is not specific for TAFIa and that clotting induced with batroxobin is not an optimal model because the mechanical properties, clot morphology, and protein composition differ from those of clotting induced with thrombin. This study was undertaken to determine whether TAFI zymogen is antifibrinolytic or whether thrombin at a low level (5 nm) activates TAFI to a degree sufficient to attenuate lysis. A new assay specific for TAFIa (26Kim P.Y. Foley J. Hsu G. Kim P.Y. Nesheim M.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was used to measure TAFIa levels in human platelet-poor normal plasma supplemented with TAFI (66–1000 nm final concentrations) and clotted with thrombin plus calcium. The results indicate that TAFI zymogen does not attenuate fibrinolysis.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) plasmas were prepared as described previously. The buffer used in all experiments (unless stated otherwise) was 0.2-μm filtered 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80, pH 7.4 (HEPES-buffered saline). All plasmas used were dialyzed extensively against HEPES-buffered saline. Clot Lysis Assays—TAFI-deficient plasma (TDP; 1:3 dilution) supplemented with 0–133 nm TAFI was clotted with 5 nm thrombin and 10 mm CaCl2 and lysed with 1 nm tPA in the presence or absence of 10 μm PTCI (final concentrations). Coagulation and lysis were monitored turbidometrically at 37 °C and 405 nm using a SpectraMax Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and lysis times were determined. Lysis time is defined as the time required, after clot initiation, to decrease the absorbance to one-half of the plateau value achieved after clotting. AAFR Cleavage by TAFI and TAFIa—A solution (80 μl) containing AAFR in the presence or absence of PTCI was added to wells of a 96-well plate, and the absorbance (349 nm) was monitored continually (1-min intervals) at room temperature using the SpectraMax Plus plate reader. Between readings, TAFI or TAFIa (40 μl) was added to each well containing AAFR (±PTCI). In each experiment, the final concentrations were 120 μm AAFR, 0–20 μm PTCI, and 133 nm TAFI or 300 pm TAFIa. Preparation of Samples for Assay of TAFIa—A 25-μl mixture containing thrombin, CaCl2, and tPA was added to a number of 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. A 50-μl aliquot comprising 25 μl of TDP and 25 μl of recombinant TAFI (prewarmed to 37 °C) was added to each tube with mixing, and the solutions were immediately incubated at 37 °C. The final concentrations were 5 nm thrombin, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 nm tPA, 66–1000 nm TAFI, and a 1:3 dilution of TDP. Ancrod (0.52 units/ml final concentration) instead of thrombin was used to initiate clotting in some experiments. Parallel clots were made in 96-well plates, and the absorbance (405 nm) was monitored at 37 °C using the SpectraMax Plus plate reader to determine the time courses of clotting and subsequent lysis. All 96-well plates were blocked with 1% Tween 80 for >1 h, washed with deionized distilled water, and dried before use. Clotting and fibrinolysis were arrested at various time points using 100 μm Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (1 μl). Clots were vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was removed and immediately placed on ice. Samples were diluted 1:5 and 1:25 using TDP and assayed for TAFIa. Effect of TAFI Zymogen on the Assay for TAFIa—TDP was supplemented with 500 nm TAFI zymogen, and the plasma was assayed for TAFIa activity as described (26Kim P.Y. Foley J. Hsu G. Kim P.Y. Nesheim M.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Assay of TAFIa—QSY-FDPs were prepared and characterized essentially as described (26Kim P.Y. Foley J. Hsu G. Kim P.Y. Nesheim M.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 80 μl of a solution of 1.25 μm QSY-FDPs and 62.5 nm 5-IAF-Pg in HEPES-buffered saline was added to each well of an opaque 96-well plate and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature while continually (1-min intervals) monitoring the intensity with excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 520 nm, respectively, with a 495-nm emission cutoff filter using a SpectraMax Gemini XS fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices). TAFIa standards or samples (20 μl) then were added to the 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette between readings. Initial rates were measured for each standard, and a standard curve was generated. The initial rate of each sample was measured, and the standard curve was used to determine the TAFIa concentration. Effect of PTCI on tPA-induced Lysis—Clotting and lysis were initiated in TDP supplemented with 0–133 nm TAFI in the presence or absence of 10 μm PTCI. Clotting was initiated with 5 nm thrombin plus 10 mm CaCl2, and lysis was initiated with 1 nm tPA. Clot lysis profiles are presented in Fig. 1. In the absence of PTCI, increasing TAFI zymogen levels resulted in an increase in the lysis time, as reported previously by Valnickova et al. (20Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Potempa J. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3066-3076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggests that the addition of TAFI to TDP prolongs lysis. However, PTCI (10 μm) completely abolished this prolongation of lysis, giving a lysis time equal to that found in TDP without added TAFI (24 min). PTCI Inhibits TAFIa but Not TAFI—To determine whether the prolonged lysis seen in Fig. 1 was due to TAFI zymogen or TAFIa, the carboxypeptidase substrate AAFR, was used to determine the effect of PTCI on the activities of TAFI and TAFIa. PTCI (0–20 μm) was titrated into AAFR (120 μm) (data not shown), and the absorbance was monitored continually (1-min intervals). Once a base line had been established, TAFI zymogen (133 nm) or TAFIa (300 pm) was added. PTCI at a concentration of 10 μm was sufficient to completely inhibit the cleavage of AAFR by TAFIa (Fig. 2A), but it had no inhibitory effect on TAFI zymogen (Fig. 2B). The curvature in the progress curves for hydrolysis of AAFR is due to the depletion of substrate over time. Because ∼450-fold more TAFI was used compared with TAFIa, the higher rate of AAFR cleavage by TAFI was expected. Because TAFIa is inhibited by PTCI but TAFI zymogen is not, any prolongation of lysis in the presence of PTCI would be due strictly to TAFI zymogen in the plasma. In the presence of PTCI, no prolongation of lysis by TAFI was detected (Fig. 1). These observations indicate the enzyme TAFIa (not the zymogen TAFI) attenuates clot lysis. TAFI Zymogen Does Not Cleave Soluble Fibrin Degradation Products—The standard curve for our assay of TAFIa is generated by measuring the initial rate (over ∼10 min) of 5-IAF-Pg dissociation from soluble fibrin degradation products (QSY-FDPs) in the presence of known concentrations of TAFIa (26Kim P.Y. Foley J. Hsu G. Kim P.Y. Nesheim M.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TDP supplemented with 200 pm TAFIa showed an increase in fluorescence, suggesting cleavage of lysines on QSY-FDPs and subsequent dissociation of 5-IAF-Pg. When TDP was supplemented with 500 nm TAFI zymogen and assayed for TAFIa, the rate of 5-IAF-Pg dissociation was not significantly different from that in TDP (Fig. 3), indicating that TAFI zymogen is not able to cleave the macromolecular substrate QSY-FDPs, thus demonstrating that our assay is specific for TAFIa. TAFIa Concentration Time Courses during tPA-induced Clot Lysis—TAFI zymogen at various concentrations was added to TDP to determine its effect on lysis when clotting was induced with 5 nm thrombin plus 10 mm CaCl2 and lysis was induced with 1 nm tPA. A recently described assay specific for TAFIa (26Kim P.Y. Foley J. Hsu G. Kim P.Y. Nesheim M.E. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was utilized to confirm that TAFIa was indeed present. In experiments designed to duplicate those of Valnickova et al. (20Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Potempa J. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3066-3076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that the amount of TAFI activated was dependent upon the concentration of TAFI zymogen in the plasma (Fig. 4). In the absence of TAFI, the lysis time was ∼24 min. As the concentration of TAFI was increased, the lysis time also increased. When 66 nm TAFI was added, the lysis time doubled to 50 min, and 110 pm TAFIa was measured at its peak. At the highest TAFI concentration (1000 nm), the lysis time was 6-fold longer (155 min), and 525 pm TAFIa was measured at its peak (Fig. 4). Similar trends were observed when the plasma was supplemented with 133 and 500 nm TAFI. In all cases, TAFIa levels peaked between 20 and 40 min after coagulation was initiated, and the peak levels decreased as the concentration of TAFI zymogen decreased. Valnickova et al. (20Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Potempa J. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3066-3076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) showed that when soluble thrombomodulin was included during the clotting and lysis of normal plasma, the lysis time was extended by >3-fold compared with that in the absence of soluble thrombomodulin. When PTCI was added with soluble thrombomodulin to inhibit TAFIa, the lysis time was the same as in the absence of soluble thrombomodulin, an observation from which Valnickova et al. inferred that TAFI is not activated in the absence of soluble thrombomodulin. However, TAFI was activated in plasma supplemented with TAFI, as shown in Fig. 4, and attenuation of lysis can be attributed specifically to TAFIa. The activation of TAFI by thrombin has a relatively high Km compared with its plasma concentration (7Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), which implies that the addition of TAFI zymogen would increase the rate of TAFI activation in a concentration-dependent manner. As a result, as the TAFI concentration is increased, the TAFIa concentration increases, and the extent to which lysis is prolonged increases. Because TAFI activation occurs during the propagation phase of coagulation, TAFI-deficient, barium citrate-adsorbed plasma was supplemented with 500 nm TAFI to determine the extent of TAFI activation in plasma lacking an intrinsic coagulation pathway. When clotting was initiated with 5 nm thrombin plus 10 mm CaCl2 and lysis was induced with 1 nm tPA, the lysis time was 30.5 min, and TAFIa appeared transiently at 5 min and again at 40 min (Fig. 5A). This is consistent with the timing of both thrombin addition and subsequent plasmin production. This demonstrates that even in plasma lacking an intrinsic coagulation pathway, 5 nm thrombin is sufficient to activate some TAFI and to prolong lysis in the absence of soluble thrombomodulin. Clots formed in TAFI-deficient, barium citrate-adsorbed plasma with no added TAFI lysed in 19.3 min under the same conditions. When clotting was induced in TAFI-deficient, barium citrate-adsorbed plasma with 500 nm TAFI and 0.52 units/ml ancrod in place of thrombin plus 10 mm CaCl2 in the presence of 1 nm tPA, the lysis time was 13.3 min, and the TAFIa level peaked at 207 pm 10 min after the clot had fully lysed (Fig. 5B). This peak was probably due to TAFI activation by plasmin. The extent of TAFI activation post-lysis was similar to that observed when coagulation was induced with thrombin. When ancrod (instead of thrombin) was used to initiate coagulation, the TAFIa peak that corresponded with thrombin addition was absent, whereas the secondary peak due to TAFI activation by plasmin remained (Fig. 5B). The lysis time was much shorter than that observed when clotting was initiated with thrombin (13.3 min compared with 30.5 min). Clotting induced with ancrod in the presence of 500 nm TAFI had shorter lysis times compared with clotting initiated with thrombin in the absence of TAFI, which may be due to differences in clot structure (25Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Potempa J. Enghild J.J. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 5: 1336-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In summary, our results show that whereas TAFI zymogen catalyzes cleavage of a small substrate, it does not catalyze cleavage of plasmin-modified fibrin (fibrin degradation products). Consequently, TAFI zymogen is not antifibrinolytic. The fact that increased TAFI zymogen added at time 0 results in increased lysis times is due to increased levels of TAFIa appearing as a consequence of activation by thrombin used to form the clot."

Yeast cells expressing less than 3% of subunit h, but still containing intact mitochondrial genomes, grew poorly on respiratory substrates because of a major impairment of ATP synthesis originating from the ATP synthase, whereas the respiratory chain complexes were not affected. The lack of ATP synthesis in the subunit h-depleted (δh) mitochondria was attributed to defects in the assembly/stability of the ATP synthase. A main feature of δh-mitochondria was a very low content (<6%) in the mitochondrially encoded Atp6p subunit, an essential component of the enzyme proton channel, which was in large part because of a slowing down in translation. Interestingly, depletion of subunit h resulted in dramatic changes in mitochondrial cristae morphology, which further supports the existence of a link between the ATP synthase and the folding/biogenesis of the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Interestingly, depletion of subunit h resulted in dramatic changes in mitochondrial cristae morphology, which further supports the existence of a link between the ATP synthase and the folding/biogenesis of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In the inner mitochondrial membrane, the F1F0-ATP synthase synthesizes ATP using the H+ electrochemical gradient Δμ˜H+ generated by the respiratory chain. This is a reversible enzyme that can also hydrolyze ATP in a reaction coupled to a proton transport out of the mitochondrial matrix. Historically, two different parts of this enzymatic complex have been described as follows: (i) the water-soluble sector F1, composed of α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ subunits, which retains the ability to hydrolyze ATP in solution; (ii) the F0 sector, which is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and composed, in yeast, of subunits 9, 6, 4, 8, f, OSCP, h, and d. The ATP synthesis is only possible when the F1 is bound to the F0 (1Velours J. Arselin G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ATP synthase complex can be described as a molecular rotary motor. The rotor, which is driven by the proton flux through the inner membrane, is composed of the subunit 9 oligomer (10 copies) and the central stalk subunits γ, δ, and ϵ. The stator is composed of nine major subunits. Subunits β, which hold the catalytic sites, are organized with subunits α in a soluble (αβ)3 hexamer. Subunits OSCP, 4, d, h, f, 8, and i form a peripheral stalk linked to the catalytic (αβ)3 hexamer and to subunit 6. Subunit 9 oligomer and subunit 6 interact in the membrane to form a proton-conducting pathway. The current model for ATP synthase energy coupling is the binding change mechanism (2Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), according to which affinity changes for substrates and products at the catalytic sites are coupled to proton transport via the rotation of the γ subunit inside the (αβ)3 hexamer (2Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Evidence of this rotation during ATP hydrolysis or synthesis in the isolated F1 sector or the entire enzyme has been obtained by optical microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (3Duncan T.M.

Subunits e, g, k, and i of the mitochondrial ATP synthase are referred to as “supernumerary” because they have no counterparts in bacteria. These subunits are not essential for cellular growth on nonfermentable sources and have only been found, for the first three, associated with ATP synthase dimers (7Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schagger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The absence of subunit e and/or subunit g results in a strong alteration of the cristae morphology (8Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brèthes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), indicating that the ATP synthase controls in some way the biogenesis of the inner mitochondrial membrane. It has been proposed that the F1 sector biogenesis occurs independently of the F0 sector (9Orian J.M. Hadikusumo R.G. Marzuki S. Linnane A.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1984; 16: 561-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and requires the presence of the general Hsp60p chaperone and at least three assembly factors (Atp12p, Atp11p, and Fmc1p) with specific actions in the hexamerization of the α-F1 and β-F1 proteins (10Ackerman S.H.

Subunit 9 pre-formed oligomer in the inner mitochondrial membrane is believed to anchor the F1 sector to the membrane (13Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), forming an F1-910 complex to which subunits 8, 4, and other F0 components are assembled (14Hadikusumo R.G. Meltzer S.

Finally, the two chaperones Atp10p and Atp23p were shown to be required for the assembly of subunit 6 (16Tzagoloff A. Barrientos A. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Biol.

Subunit h is a 10.4-kDa water-soluble protein encoded by the nuclear gene ATP14. Although they share only 15% identity, yeast subunit h and bovine F6 subunit were shown to be functionally equivalent as evidenced by the ability of F6 to complement the absence of subunit h gene in Δatp14 yeast cells (where Δatp14 indicates deletion of the S. cerevisiae ATP14 gene, coding for ATP synthase subunit h) (19Velours J.

Subunit h is part of the ATP synthase peripheral stalk, as shown by chemical cross-link studies that revealed its proximities to subunits α, f, d, and 4 (20Fronzes R. Chaignepain S. Bathany K.

Biol. 2005; 345: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cross-links between two subunits h belonging to two ATP synthase monomers indicated that this subunit is located near or at the dimerization interface of this complex (23Fronzes R. Weimann T. Vaillier J. Velours J. Brèthes D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6715-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, a subcomplex of the peripheral stalk of the bovine ATP synthase was obtained by co-expression in Escherichia coli of large soluble domains of bovine subunits 4, d, and F6 (homologous to yeast subunit h). This sub-complex was purified and crystallized (24Silvester J.A. Dickson V.K. Runswick M.J. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), showing that subunit F6 is located at the top of the peripheral stalk, wrapped along subunit 4 C terminus (25Dickson V.K. Silvester J.A. Fearnley I.M. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2911-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Further insight on the role of subunit h was sought through the construction of a yeast strain lacking the ATP14 gene (26Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, as for many other ATP synthase mutations, Δh yeast was genetically unstable in the form of more than 90% of ρ-/ρ0 cells, i.e. cells issued from large/complete deletions in the mtDNA. This hampered the analysis of the consequences of a lack in subunit h on the ATP synthase because of the secondary loss of several components of the mitochondrial energy-transducing system encoded by the mtDNA, among which are the two main subunits (Atp6p and Atp9p) of the ATP synthase proton channel (26Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, we constructed a subunit h regulatable gene, under the control of a doxycycline repressible promoter (27Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Such a method has already been successful when used for the study of several ATP synthase subunits (28Duvezin-Caubet S. Caron M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40392-40399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), among which is the δ subunit whose gene deletion results in populations exclusively composed of ρ-/ρ0 cells. In this way, we were able to generate yeast populations almost completely depleted in subunit h where most (>95%) of the cells were still ρ+. This allowed us to investigate in excellent conditions the specific consequences of a lack in subunit h. We show that subunit h depletion leads to a secondary loss in subunit 6 due in large part to a decrease of its synthesis, whereas most of the other enzyme subunits still show a rather good accumulation. In addition, we provide evidence that subunit h is critical for a correct maintenance of mitochondrial cristae morphology, which further supports the existence of a link between ATP synthase and the folding of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Materials—Digitonin (Sigma) was recrystallized twice in EtOH (30Kun E. Kirsten E. Piper W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of reagent grade quality. Strains and Media—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain SDC22 (MATα, arg8::HIS3, ade2-1, ura3-11,15, leu2-3,112, trp1-1, can1-100, ARG8m, rho+) was the wild type strain (28Duvezin-Caubet S. Caron M.

Rich glucose (YPD), galactose (YPGal), or lactate (YPLac) media and synthetic complete medium used for growing yeast strains were prepared as described previously (28Duvezin-Caubet S. Caron M.

Biochimie (Paris). 1976; 58: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Genetic and Molecular Biology Methods—DNA manipulations were done using standard methods (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Bacteria and yeast were respectively transformed by electroporation and lithium chloride methods (33Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Construction of Mutant Strains—The coding sequence of subunit h was PCR-amplified from previously described pRS313 ATP14 (26Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The resulting ATP14 amplicon was cloned into pCM189 (BamHI-NotI) downstream of the doxycycline-repressible promoter to give pRF1. pRF1-transformed strain, selected on synthetic complete medium lacking uracil, was named RFY1. In this strain, the ATP14 gene was disrupted at its locus with KanR gene using a PCR-based method as described previously (34Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Cells that had integrated KanR at the ATP14 gene locus were selected on YPD plates containing 200 μg·ml-1 of geneticin and analyzed by PCR. A clone called RFY5-1 carrying the expected disruption of ATP14 gene, in a ρ+ state and containing pRF1 was retained for further analysis. Quantification of the Amount of ρ-/ρ0 Cells upon Subunit h Depletion by Doxycycline Addition—The amount of ρ-/ρ0 cells was calculated from the difference between individual colonies growing on YPD versus residual individual colonies growing after replication on complete glycerol medium. In order not to take into account the cells resulting from plasmid loss, RFY5-1 cells (Δatp14/pCM189-ATP14) were primarily mated with ρ0 (ATP14) cells, so that the inability to grow on complete glycerol medium could only be attributed to a loss of or a deletion in mitochondrial DNA. Biochemical Procedures—Cells were grown aerobically at 28 °C in a liquid complete medium containing 2% lactate or 2% galactose as carbon source and harvested in logarithmic growth phase (8.107 cells·ml-1). Mitochondria were prepared as described previously (35Law R.H. Manon S. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and suspended in the isolation buffer (0.6 m mannitol, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.8). Protein concentration was determined according to the Lowry method (36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 5% (w/v) SDS with bovine serum albumin as standard protein. Oxygen consumption rates were measured at 28 °C with a Clark-type oxygen electrode on freshly prepared mitochondria diluted to 0.3 mg·ml-1 in respiration buffer (0.65 m mannitol, 0.3 mm EGTA, 3 mm Tris-phosphate, 10 mm Tris-maleate, pH 6.75) as described (37Rigoulet M. Guérin B. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Variations in transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) were evaluated in the same conditions by measurement of rhodamine 123 (1 μg·ml-1) fluorescence quenching using λem = 530 nm and λex = 485 nm on a SAFAS (Monte-Carlo, Monaco) fluorescence spectrophotometer (38Emaus R.K.

ATP synthesis was measured by bioluminescence using the luciferin/luciferase kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and an LKB-Wallac luminometer. ATP hydrolysis and oligomycin sensitivity were measured on Triton X-100-treated mitochondria (0.75 g·g-1 of proteins) as already described (39Somlo M. Eur. J.

Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4338-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial digitonin extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 40,000 × g. Forty microliters of supernatant were immediately loaded onto a 3–13% polyacrylamide slab gel. After electrophoresis, ATPase activity was revealed by incubating the gel in 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (w/v) lead acetate, 50 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 8.6 (43Grandier-Vazeille X. Guérin M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The bands of interest were cut, incubated in 1% (w/v) SDS for 1 h, and analyzed in a second dimension by SDS-PAGE (41Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal.

Proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Membrane Protean BA83, Schleicher & Schuell). Primary antibodies were polyclonal rabbit antibodies. Secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Western blots were revealed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences) on a CCD camera (GeneGnome, Syngene Bio-Imaging) or with photographic films (Hyperfilm, Amersham Biosciences). Quantification was done using ImageJ software. Synthesis and Degradation of Mitochondrial Translation Products—The RFY5-1 strain was grown to early exponential phase (4 × 107 cells·ml-1) in 100 ml of liquid YPGal medium containing or not doxycycline (10 μg·ml-1). About 4 × 109 cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with cold sterile water. Cells were resuspended in 5 ml of a low sulfate medium containing 1% galactose, supplemented with adenine, uracil, leucine, and tryptophan (50 mg·l-1 each) ± doxycycline (10 μg·ml-1) and incubated for 40 min at 28 °C. Cycloheximide (0.6 mg·ml-1) was added to the cell suspension. After a 5-min incubation (pulse labeling) at 28 °C, 2 mCi (74 MBq) of 35S in vitro cell labeling mix (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the incubation was carried out for another 5 min at 28 °C. The labeling reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of a Met + Cys solution (250 mm). For each time of chase, 1 ml of cell suspension was mixed with 1 ml of casamino acids 100 mg·ml-1, Na2SO4 2 mg·ml-1. Cells were harvested and washed twice. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of NaOH 1.85 m, β-mercaptoethanol 7.5% and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. One millimeter of 50% trichloroacetic acid was added, and after a 10-min incubation at 4 °C, the solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 5% SDS, neutralized by addition of aliquots of Tris 1 m, incubated for 15 min at 42 °C, and centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 × g. Protein concentration was determined on the supernatant, and 50 μg of each sample was separated on a 12.5% acrylamide gel, containing 4 m urea and 25% glycerol (44Zeng X. Hourset A. Tzagoloff A. Genetics. 2007; 175: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The gel was dried out, and the incorporated radioactivity was counted using a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Fuji). For each sample, each subunit level was quantified relatively to the total incorporated radioactivity.

Freezing and Freeze Substitution for Ultrastructural Analyses of Yeast Cells—The RFY5-1 strain was grown for 14 h to early exponential phase (107 cells·ml-1) in liquid YPGal medium in the absence or presence of doxycycline (10 μg·ml-1). The yeast pellets were placed on the surface of a copper EM grid (400 mesh) coated with Formvar. Each loop was very quickly submersed in pre-cooled liquid propane and kept at -180 °C in liquid nitrogen. The loops were then transferred to a pre-cooled solution of 4% osmium tetroxide in dry acetone in a 1.8-ml polypropylene vial and kept at -82 °C for 48 h (substitution fixation), warmed gradually to room temperature, and washed three times in dry acetone. Specimens were stained for 1 h with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate in acetone at 4 °C in a dark room. Following another rinse in dry acetone, the loops were progressively infiltrated with araldite (epoxy resin, Fluka). Ultrathin sections were contrasted with lead citrate. Observations were done on a Philips Tecnai 12 electron microscope. Data presented in this study were analyzed and written with free softwares under GNU GPL license. Depletion of Subunit h Severely Compromises the Respiratory Growth of Yeast—We have constructed the RFY5-1 strain by transformation of yeast cells with a plasmid where the coding sequence of ATP14 is under the control of a doxycycline-repressible promoter followed by deletion of the chromosomal ATP14 gene. In this way, one can block the expression of subunit h simply and quickly by the addition of doxycycline to the growth medium. In nonfermentable lactate medium, doubling time of RFY5-1 was 190 ± 16 min in the absence of doxycycline and increased to 824 ± 19 min in the presence of 10 μg·ml-1 doxycycline (data not shown). Progressive attenuation of subunit h after the addition of doxycycline was observed by Western blotting of whole cell protein extracts prepared at different culture times (Fig. 1A). After 24 h, i.e. less than 2 generations, about 6% of subunit h was still present in the RFY5-1 cells grown in the presence of doxycycline. When galactose, a fermentable carbon source, was used to grow RFY5-1, the doubling time was almost not modified by the addition of doxycycline, i.e. 150 and 170 min without and with doxycycline, respectively, and after 14 h, i.e. 3 generations, subunit h was virtually absent in whole cell extracts (Fig. 1B). However, when the cells grown for 14 h in galactose + doxycycline medium were transferred into lactate + doxycycline medium, a slow residual growth was still observed, whereas the same cells recovered a normal respiratory growth when doxycycline was not included in the lactate medium (Fig. 1D). After 75 h, the lactate + doxycycline culture reached a cell density similar to that of the culture made in absence of doxycycline. Thus, despite an apparent total cellular lack in subunit h, respiration-dependent growth was not completely abolished. However, when the Western blot analyses were performed with mitochondrial protein preparations instead of whole cell extracts, a low level of subunit h could be detected at about 3% compared with control mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 1E). The residual respiratory growth of RFY5-1 in the presence of doxycycline was thus likely because of a small transcriptional leak at the level of the doxycycline-repressible promoter. Influence of a Depletion in Subunit h on the Stability of the mtDNA—In previous studies, cultures of Δatp14 yeast were found to contain a high number (>95%) of ρ-/ρ0 cells. The reason for this mtDNA instability is not known. The accumulation of ρ-/ρ0 cells by RFY5-1 strain after the addition of doxycycline (Fig. 1C) remained very low at least during 5–6 generations. At 25 h after the addition of doxycycline, i.e. after about 8–9 generations, the proportion of cells increased to about 20 versus 5% for the culture of RFY5-1 made in the absence of doxycycline. It might be that after a block in subunit h expression, mtDNA molecules are progressively lost over cell divisions, and ρ-/ρ0 cells appear after quite a large number of generations. The production of cultures of cells lacking the ATP14 gene requires at least 30 generations after the initial recombination event leading to the deletion of ATP14 from the chromosome. With the doxycycline-repressible subunit h gene, only a limited number of generations suffices to obtain large cultures almost completely depleted in subunit h. This system provides excellent conditions for the study of the consequences of a specific lack in subunit h. Throughout this study, doxycycline was used at a 10 μg·ml-1 concentration, and yeast grown in the presence of this concentration of doxycycline will be named δh, as opposed to Δh in which the nuclear ATP14 gene is disrupted. Subunit h Is Essential for ATP Synthesis but Not for ATP Hydrolysis by the ATP Synthase—To further characterize the consequences of a lack in subunit h on oxidative phosphorylations, several parameters were investigated as follows: respiratory rates, ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activities, and mitochondrial electrical transmembrane potential. Measurements were done on mitochondria isolated from RFY5-1 strain grown 14 h in a galactose medium containing (δh-mitochondria) or not (control mitochondria) doxycycline (10 μg·ml-1). Respiration rates were measured with either NADH or ascorbate/TMPD as substrates (Fig. 2A). Because the amount of respiratory complexes could vary from one preparation to another, respiratory rates were expressed as a percentage of the maximal rate obtained in the presence of the membrane uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and using ascorbate and 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol (TMPD) as electron donors. Basal (state 4), uncoupled (NADH + CCCP), and maximal respiration (ascorbate/TMPD + CCCP) rates were relatively similar in mitochondria whether depleted or not in subunit h, showing that the depletion in subunit h did not increase the passive permeability to protons of the inner membrane and did not affect the expression of the respiratory chain complexes. Addition of ADP stimulated the respiration to state 3 in both mitochondrial preparations but to a much lesser extent in δh-mitochondria than in the control. In δh-mitochondria, the respiratory control was only 1.2 ± 0.1 versus 2.4 ± 0.2 in control mitochondria. Mitochondrial ATP synthesis was monitored using NADH as substrate in the presence of a saturating amount of ADP (Fig. 2B). In the control mitochondria, ATP synthesis rate was high (0.72 μmol ATP·min-1·mg-1 of proteins), giving a"

We generated transgenic mice carrying Fabpl4xat-132 ephrin-A1, which express ephrin-A1 in the intestinal epithelial cells. Those mice were then mated with Apcmin/+ mice to produce the compound mice, which overexpress ephrin-A1 in the intestinal tumors of Apcmin/+ mice. We compared the number, size and histopathological features of the intestinal tumors in the Fabpl4xat-132 ephrin-A1/Apcmin/+ compound mice with those of the Apcmin/+ mice. The compound mice showed an increased number of intestinal tumors, significantly in the large intestine, and developed more invasive tumors. Among the 20 mice of each type examined, 5 Apcmin/+ mice developed 5 invasive tumors, 1 invasive tumor in each mouse, in the proximal or middle portions of the small intestine. On the other hand, 14 out of 20 compound mice developed 29 invasive tumors and 16 of them were in the distal small intestine and the large intestine, where transgenic ephrin-A1 was highly expressed. These results suggested that the increased expression of ephrin-A1 accelerated the malignant progression of the intestinal adenoma to invasive tumors."

When the confirmatory result is negative or indeterminate (i.e. discordant with rapid result), repeat confirmatory testing should be conducted using a follow-up specimen. Previous reports have not described whether repeat testing adequately resolves the HIV-infection status of persons with discordant results.Post-marketing surveillance was conducted in 368 testing sites affiliated with 14 state and 2 city health departments from August 11, 2004 to June 30, 2005 and one health department through December 31, 2005. For persons with discordant results, data were collected on demographics, risk behaviors, HIV test results and specimen types. Persons with repeat confirmatory results were classified as HIV-infected or uninfected. Regression models were created to assess risk factors for not having repeat testing.Of 167,371 rapid tests conducted, 2589 (1.6%) were reactive: of these, 2417 (93%) had positive WB/IFA, 172 (7%) had negative or indeterminate WB/IFA. Of 89/172 (52%) persons with a repeat confirmatory test: 17 (19%) were HIV-infected, including 3 with indeterminate WB and positive NAAT; 72 (81%) were uninfected, including 12 with repeat indeterminate WB. Factors associated with HIV-infection included having an initial indeterminate WB/IFA (vs. negative) (p<0.001) and having an initial oral fluid WB (vs. serum) (p<0.001). Persons who had male-female sex (vs. male-male sex) were at increased risk for not having a repeat test [adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI (1.3, 4.9)].Though only half of persons with discordant results had repeat confirmatory testing, of those who did, nearly one in five were HIV-infected. These findings underscore the need for rapid HIV testing programs to increase repeat confirmatory testing for persons with discordant results. Because of the lower sensitivity of oral fluid WBs, confirmatory testing following a reactive rapid test should be conducted using serum or plasma, when possible."
https://openalex.org/W1968141756,"2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME), an endogenous estrogen metabolite of 17β-estradiol, is known to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through several mechanisms. We sought to study the effect of mitochondrialy targeted hOGG1 (MTS-hOGG1) on HeLa cells exposed to 2-ME. MTS-hOGG1-expressing cells exposed to 2-ME showed increased cellular survival and had significantly less G2/M cell cycle arrest compared to vector-only-transfected cells. In addition, 2-ME exposure resulted in an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential, increased apoptosis, accompanied by higher activation of caspase-3, -9, cleavage of Bid to tBid and protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in HeLa cells lacking MTS-hOGG1. Fas inhibitors cerulenin or C75 inhibited 2-ME-induced caspase activation, PARP cleavage, apoptosis and reversed mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, thereby recapitulating the increased expression of MTS-hOGG1. Hence, MTS-hOGG1 plays an important protective role against 2-ME-mediated mitochondrial damage by blocking apoptosis induced through the Fas pathway."
