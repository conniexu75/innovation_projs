https://openalex.org/W1976972281,"Diamond may be grown at low pressures where it is the metastable form of carbon. Recent advances in a wide variety of plasma and electrical discharge methods have led to dramatic increases in growth rates. All of these methods have certain aspects in common, namely, the presence of atomic hydrogen and the production of energetic carbon-containing fragments under conditions that support high mobilities on the diamond surface. Some understanding of the processes taking place during nucleation and growth of diamond has been achieved, but detailed molecular mechanisms are not yet known. Related research has led to the discovery of a new class of materials, the ""diamondlike"" phases. Vapor-grown diamond and diamondlike materials may have eventual applications in abrasives, tool coatings, bearing surfaces, electronics, optics, tribological surfaces, and corrosion protection."

Thus, a newly discovered feature of the Bi(2)Sr3-xCaxCu(2)O8+y structure is sizable Cu displacement, which is related to static wave formation in the Cu-O sheets. Reported thermal parameters give evidence that similar distortions occur on cooling of the thallium-containing superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2081678869,"Although 248-nanometer radiation falls 0.12 electron volt short of the energy needed to dissociate O(2) large densities of ozone (O(3)) can be produced from unfocused 248-nanometer KrF excimer laser irradiation of pure O(2). The process is initiated in some undefined manner, possibly through weak two-photon O(2) dissociation, which results in a small amount of O(3) being generated. As soon as any O(3) is present, it strongly absorbs the 248-nanometer radiation and dissociates to vibrationally excited ground state O(2) (among other products), with a quantum yield of 0.1 to 0.15. During the laser pulse, a portion of these molecules absorb a photon and dissociate, which results in the production of three oxygen atoms for one O(3) molecule destroyed. Recombination then converts these atoms to O(3), and thus O(3) production in the system is autocatalytic. A deficiency exists in current models of O(3) photochemistry in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere, in that more O(3) iS found than can be explained. A detailed analysis of the system as it applies to the upper atmosphere is not yet possible, but with reasonable assumptions about O(2) vibrational distributions resulting from O(3) photodissociation and about relaxation rates of vibrationally excited O(2) a case can be made for the importance of incuding this mechanism in the models."
https://openalex.org/W2082243179,A long-term goal of inertial-confinement fusion research is the generation of energy by imploding capsules containing deuterium-tritium fuel. Progress in designing the capsules is aided by accurate imaging of the fusion burn. Penumbral coded-aperture techniques have been used to obtain neutron images that are a direct measurement of the fusion burn region in the capsules.
https://openalex.org/W1968127799,"An approximate doubling in plant growth, total plant nitrogen, nodulation, and overall dinitrogen fixation of alfalfa are the consequences of the action of a toxin delivered by a Pseudomonas infesting the alfalfa rhizosphere. The toxin, tabtoxinine-beta-lactam, inactivates selectively one form of glutamine synthetase in the nodules. Thus, normal glutamine synthetase-catalyzed ammonia assimilation is significantly impaired; yet these plants assimilated about twice the normal amount of nitrogen. How plants regulate dinitrogen fixing symbiotic associations is an important and unresolved question; the current results imply that the glutamine synthetase-catalyzed step in ammonia assimilation, a plant function, strongly influences overall dinitrogen fixation in legumes."
https://openalex.org/W2055810253,"Superconductivity above the temperature of liquid nitrogen in copper oxide-based systems has led to optimism that superconductors may at last find wide application. The critical temperature, however, is just one of the required parameters. The materials must be made into usable forms such as wire, thick films, thin films, and bulk ceramics. In addition, the critical current in these various forms is a crucial test of their utility. This article reviews the processing techniques used to fabricate potentially useful forms and assesses remaining problems. Considerable improvement in critical current density is necessary in bulk materials, and thin films need to be made compatible with other thin-film technology."

https://openalex.org/W2048966689,"Ion implantation, because it is inherently a strongly nonequilibrium process, can add a new dimension to materials studies. A large variety of chemical elements may be readily introduced into a target substrate by ion bombardment at concentrations considerably greater than the normal solid solubilities. In addition, the interaction of the accelerated ions with the target produces lattice defects. Both effects have been studied extensively in experiments directed at understanding the mechanisms of formation of buried oxide and silicide layers in silicon with high-dose ion implantation. These layers have properties that are difficult to attain with conventional techniques."
