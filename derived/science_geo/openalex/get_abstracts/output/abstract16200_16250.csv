https://openalex.org/W1507814807,"The recent identification in Heloderma horridum venom of exendin-3, a new member of the glucagon superfamily that acts as a pancreatic secretagogue, prompted a search for a similar peptide in Heloderma suspectum venom. An amino acid sequencing assay for peptides containing an amino-terminal histidine residue (His1) was used to isolate a 39-amino acid peptide, exendin-4, from H. suspectum venom. Exendin-4 differs from exendin-3 by two amino acid substitutions, Gly2-Glu3 in place of Ser2-Asp3, but is otherwise identical. The structural differences make exendin-4 distinct from exendin-3 in its bioactivity. In dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas, natural and synthetic exendin-4 stimulate a monophasic increase in cAMP beginning at 100 pM that plateaus at 10 nM. The exendin-4-induced increase in cAMP is inhibited progressively by increasing concentrations of the exendin receptor antagonist, exendin-(9-39) amide. Unlike exendin-3, exendin-4 does not stimulate a second rise in acinar cAMP at concentrations greater than 100 nM, does not stimulate amylase release, and does not inhibit the binding of radiolabeled vasoactive intestinal peptide to acini. This indicates that in dispersed pancreatic acini, exendin-4 interacts only with the recently described exendin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1983127589,"Invertebrate phototransduction is an important model system for studying the ubiquitous inositol-lipid signaling system. In the transient receptor potential (trp) mutant, one of the most intensively studied transduction mutants of Drosophila, the light response quickly declines to baseline during prolonged intense light. Using whole-cell recordings from Drosophila photoreceptors, we show that the wild-type response is mediated by at least two functionally distinct classes of light-sensitive channels and that both the trp mutation and a Ca2+ channel blocker (La3+) selectively abolish one class of channel with high Ca2+ permeability. Evidence is also presented that Ca2+ is necessary for excitation and that Ca2+ depletion mimics the trp phenotype. We conclude that the recently sequenced trp protein represents a class of light-sensitive channel required for inositide-mediated Ca2+ entry and suggest that this process is necessary for maintained excitation during intense illumination in fly photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2078935283,"The signal transduction and pharmacological properties of a metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR1, were studied in CHO cells permanently expressing the cloned receptor. mGluR1 stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis in the potency rank order of quisqualate>l-glutamate ⩾ ibotenate>l-homocysteine sulfinate ⩾trans-ACPD. This receptor also evoked the stimulation of cAMP formation and arachidonic acid release with comparable agonist potencies. dl-AP3 and l-AN4, the effective antagonists reported for glutamate-stimulated PI hydrolysis in brain slices, showed no appreciable effects on mGIuR1, suggesting the existence of an additional subtype of this receptor family. Pertussis toxin and phorbol ester produced distinct effects on the three transduction cascades, implying that mGIuR1 independently links to the multiple transduction pathways probably through different G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2099226007,"We studied the effects of nitric oxide (NO)-producing agents on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation in cultured neurons. 3-Morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1) blocked both NMDA-induced currents and the associated increase in intracellular Ca2+. The actions of SIN-1 were reversible and suppressed by hemoglobin. A degraded SIN-1 solution that did not release NO was unable to block NMDA receptors. This showed that the SIN-1 effects were due to NO and not to another breakdown product. Similar results were obtained with 1-nitrosopyrrolidine (an NO-containing drug) and with NO released from NaNO2. Pretreatment with hemoglobin potentiated NMDA-induced effects, demonstrating that endogenous NO modulates NMDA receptors. Since NMDA receptor activation induces NO synthesis, these results suggest a feedback inhibition of NMDA receptors by NO under physiological condition."
https://openalex.org/W2152203056,"We have isolated a number of Drosophila cDNAs on the basis of their encoding calmodulin-binding proteins. A full-length cDNA clone corresponding to one of these genes has been cloned and sequenced. Conservation of amino acid sequence and tissue-specific expression are observed between this gene and the transient receptor potential (trp) gene. We propose the name transient receptor potential-like (trpl) to describe this newly isolated gene. The trpl protein contains two possible calmodulin-binding sites, six transmembrane regions, and a sequence homologous to an ankyrin-like repeat. Structurally, the trpl and trp proteins resemble cation channel proteins, particularly the brain isoform of the voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel. The identification of a protein similar to the trp gene product, yet also able to bind Ca2+/calmodulin, allows for a reinterpretation of the phenotype of the trp mutations and suggests that both genes may encode light-sensitive ion channels."

https://openalex.org/W2034856894,"Alterations in intracellular calcium levels activate several signal transduction pathways resulting in distinct patterns of gene expression. Here, a pathway for calcium-mediated signals is demonstrated that involves C/EBP beta, a member of the bZip family of transcription factors. In pituitary cells C/EBP beta was phosphorylated in response to increased intracellular calcium concentrations as a consequence of the activation of a calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of serine at position 276 within the leucine zipper of C/EBP beta appeared to confer calcium-regulated transcriptional stimulation of a promoter that contained binding sites for C/EBP beta."
https://openalex.org/W2111525938,"The lipid dependence of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP) kinase purified from bovine brain membranes was investigated. In the assay used, PIP-Triton X-100 micelles containing the lipid to be tested were presented to the enzyme. Under these conditions, phosphatidic acid (PA) stimulated the enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner up to 20-fold when an equal molar ratio of PA to PIP was attained. Stimulation by PA was highly specific; other lipids including lyso-PA and dicetylphosphate had a relatively small effect. The activation by PA was completely suppressed by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). To investigate the effect of PA on PIP kinase activity in natural membranes, endogenous PA was generated in rat brain synaptosomal plasma membranes by incubation with phospholipase D. Subsequent phosphorylation with [gamma-32P]ATP yielded an enhanced labeling of PIP2 but not of PIP in these membranes. These results suggest that PIP kinase activity may be under control of PA levels in membranes. This may have important implications for the regulation of cellular responses by agonist-induced phosphoinositide turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2090473949,"We isolated two cDNAs that encode isoforms of agrin, the basal lamina protein that mediates the motor neuron-induced aggregation of acetylcholine receptors on muscle fibers at the neuromuscular junction. Both proteins are the result of alternative splicing of the product of the agrin gene, but, unlike agrin, they are inactive in standard acetylcholine receptor aggregation assays. They lack one (agrin-related protein 1) or two (agrin-related protein 2) regions in agrin that are required for its activity. Expression studies provide evidence that both proteins are present in the nervous system and muscle and that, in muscle, myofibers and Schwann cells synthesize the agrin-related proteins while the axon terminals of motor neurons are the sole source of agrin."
https://openalex.org/W1662189542,"Rat 1a fibroblasts transformed by the Gi2 oncogene, gip2, exhibit a constitutively elevated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity that correlates with enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the p42 MAP kinase polypeptide. The MAP kinase activity in gip2 transformed cells is 50-60% of the pertussis toxin-sensitive, thrombin-stimulated activity observed in wild-type Rat 1a cells. A similar activation of MAP kinase is observed in src but not ras or raf transformed Rat 1a cells, indicating that the persistent MAP kinase activity results from the action of the specific oncoprotein and is not the consequence of cellular transformation. The enhanced transactivation function of c-Jun characteristic of the transformed phenotype, measured using a collagenase promoter-CAT reporter gene, is observed in gip2, src, ras, and raf transformed Rat 1a cells. The regulatory networks controlled by the four transforming oncogenes therefore alter the activity of specific transcription factors, but only gip2 and src constitutively activate MAP kinase. The findings demonstrate that the catalytic activity of growth factor-regulated cytoplasmic kinases are selectively and stably activated as a consequence of specific oncogene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2106988040,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces a Ca2+ influx in many cell types, but the underlying mechanisms are so far unresolved. We report that: EGF-induced Ca2+ channel activity is eliminated by lipoxygenase inhibition and is mimicked by artificial induction of lipoxygenase activity; addition of leukotriene C4 can fully mimic EGF in its ability to activate Ca2+ channels; and EGF induces a rapid accumulation of intracellular leukotriene C4. In addition, we show that EGF-induced, Ca(2+)-dependent membrane hyperpolarization and junB proto-oncogene expression are dependent on lipoxygenase activity, whereas EGF-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization is not. We conclude that PLA2/5-lipoxygenase-mediated leukotriene C4 production constitutes a novel and specific signal transduction pathway in growth factor action."
https://openalex.org/W2040298836,"The possibility that damaged neural circuitries can be repaired through grafting has raised questions regarding the cellular mechanisms required for functional integration of transplanted neurons. Invertebrate models offer the potential to examine such mechanisms at the resolution of single identified neurons within well-characterized neural networks. Here it is reported that a specific deficit in the respiratory behavior of a pulmonate mollusc, caused by the ablation of a solitary interneuron, can be restored by grafting an identical donor interneuron. The transplanted interneuron not only survives and extends neurites within the host nervous system, but under specific conditions forms synapses with appropriate target neurons and is physiologically integrated into the host's circuitry, thereby restoring normal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2025002158,"We describe the transient expression of the rat skeletal muscle muI Na+ channel in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. Functional channels appear at a density of approximately 30 in a 10 microns 2 patch, comparable to those of native excitable cells. Unlike muI currents in oocytes, inactivation gating is predominantly (approximately 97%) fast, although clear evidence is provided for noninactivating gating modes, which have been linked to anomalous behavior in the inherited disorder hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. Sequence-specific antibodies detect a approximately 230 kd glycopeptide. The majority of molecules acquire only neutral oligosaccharides and are retained within the cell. Electrophoretic mobility on SDS gels suggests the molecules may acquire covalently attached lipid. The channel is readily phosphorylated by activation of the protein kinase A and protein kinase C second messenger pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1594175255,"Ca2+ efficiently inhibits binding of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) to the InsP3 receptor in cerebellar membranes but not to the purified receptor. We have now investigated the mechanism of action by which Ca2+ inhibits InsP3 binding. Our results suggest that Ca2+ does not cause the stable association of a Ca(2+)-binding protein with the receptor. Instead, Ca2+ leads to the production of a soluble, heat-stable, low molecular weight substance from cerebellar membranes that competes with InsP3 for binding. This inhibitory substance probably represents endogenously generated InsP3 as judged by the fact that it co-purifies with InsP3 on anion-exchange chromatography, competes with [3H]InsP3 binding in a pattern similar to unlabeled InsP3, and is in itself capable of releasing 45Ca2+ from permeabilized cells. A potent Ca(2+)-activated phospholipase C activity producing InsP3 was found in cerebellar microsomes that exhibited a Ca2+ dependence identical to the Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of InsP3 binding. Together these results suggest that the Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of InsP3 binding to the cerebellar receptor is due to activation of a Ca(2+)-sensitive phospholipase C enriched in cerebellum. Nevertheless, Ca2+ probably also modulates the InsP3 receptor function by a direct interaction with the receptor that does not affect InsP3 binding but regulates InsP3-dependent channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W1665467628,"The Escherichia coli Rep helicase is a stable monomer (Mr = 72,802) in the absence of DNA; however, binding of single-stranded (ss) or duplex (ds) DNA induces Rep monomers to dimerize. Furthermore, a chemically cross-linked Rep dimer retains both its DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities, suggesting that the functionally active Rep helicase is a dimer (Chao, K., and Lohman, T. M. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 221, 1165-1181). Using a modified double-filter nitrocellulose filter binding assay, we have examined quantitatively the equilibrium binding of Rep to a series of ss-oligodeoxynucleotides, d(pN)n (8 less than or equal to n less than or equal to 20) and two 16-base pair duplex oligodeoxynucleotides, which are short enough so that only a single Rep monomer can bind to each oligonucleotide. This strategy has enabled us to examine the linkage between DNA binding and dimerization. We also present a statistical thermodynamic model to describe the DNA-induced Rep dimerization in the presence of ss- and/or ds-oligodeoxynucleotides. We observe quantitative agreement between this model and the experimental binding isotherms and have analyzed these isotherms to obtain the seven independent interaction constants that describe Rep-DNA binding and Rep dimerization. We find that Rep monomers (P) can bind either ss-DNA (S) or ds-DNA (D) to form PS or PD, respectively, which can then dimerize to form P2S or P2D. Furthermore, both protomers of the DNA-induced Rep dimer can bind DNA to form either P2S2, P2D2 or the mixed dimer species P2SD and ss- and ds-DNA compete for the same sites on the Rep protein. When bound to DNA, the Rep dimerization constants are approximately 1-2 x 10(8) M-1 (6 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 4 degrees C), which are greater than the dimerization constant for free Rep monomers by at least 10(4)-fold. The Rep-ss-DNA interaction constants are independent of base composition and sequence, consistent with its role as a nonspecific DNA-binding protein. Allosteric effects are associated with ss- and ds-DNA binding to the half-saturated Rep dimers, i.e. the affinity of either ss- or ds-DNA to the free promoter of a half-saturated Rep dimer is clearly influenced by the conformation of DNA bound to the first protomer. These allosteric effects further support the proposal that the Rep dimer is functionally important and that the Rep-DNA species P2S2 and P2SD may serve as useful models for intermediates that occur during DNA unwinding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W2085811386,"Mesoderm induction and body axis determination in frog (Xenopus) embryos are thought to involve growth factor-mediated cell-cell signaling, but the signal transduction pathways are unknown. Li+, which inhibits the polyphosphoinositide (PI) cycle signal transduction pathway in many cells, also disrupts axis determination and mesoderm induction. Amounts of the PI cycle-derived second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, increased during mesoderm induction in normal embryos; addition of Li+ inhibited the embryonic inositol monophosphatase and reversed this increase. Embryonic PI cycle activity thus shows characteristics that indicate it may function in mesoderm induction and axis determination."
https://openalex.org/W1543135651,"Three conserved aspartyl residues located in the putative transmembrane helices in the Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter were replaced by Asn, Lys, or Glu with oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis. Replacement of Asp84 or Asp15 by Asn or Lys caused a severe defect in tetracycline transport activity, however, the Glu84 and Glu15 mutants retained 150 and 40% of the wild type activity, respectively, indicating the critical role of the negative charge. The increase in the activity of the Glu84 mutant was due to an increase in the affinity for the substrate. H+/tetracycline coupling was intact in these mutants, including Asn and Lys mutants. On the other hand, all of the Asp285-substitution mutants showed a severe defect in tetracycline transport activity and a complete lack of tetracycline-coupled H+ transport. However, since in vivo tests showed the tetracycline resistance for the Glu285 mutant, a negative charge in position 285 plays some role in maintaining the possible down-hill and/or low affinity efflux of accumulated tetracycline from intact cells. Similar work was done for Asp365, and here the Asn and Glu mutants showed decreased but high activity, while the Lys mutant was only marginally active (5%), indicating that a negative charge is not so demanding in position 365, possibly because it is not in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1579016601,"Cofilin and destrin are two related low molecular weight mammalian actin-binding proteins. Cofilin is an F-actin side-binding and pH-dependent actin-depolymerizing protein, and destrin is a pH-independent actin-depolymerizing protein. We have introduced a few point mutations within an actin-binding sequence of cofilin. Biochemical analyses of these mutant proteins have clearly shown that Lys112 and Lys114 of cofilin are crucially but differently involved in its interaction with actin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. This is the first example among actin-binding proteins whose point mutations inactivate their interaction with actin in vitro. We have also made and characterized a series of chimeric proteins between cofilin and destrin to identify the regions responsible for the pH dependence and the F-actin side binding activity of cofilin. Our results suggest that a central region consisting of 42 amino acid residues and a carboxyl-terminal quarter of cofilin are both involved in regulation of the pH-dependent actin depolymerizing activity and the activity to bind along F-actin."
https://openalex.org/W1496650340,"The cytoplasmic domain of murine CD45 has been expressed using an in vitro transcription/translation system. The recombinant protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation with a specific rabbit antiserum and was shown to have protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was then used to investigate the structural requirements for PTPase activity. Although the cysteine crucial for PTPase activity resides in domain I, this domain was not active alone. Both PTPase domains of CD45 and the membrane proximal region of 77 amino acids were required for enzymatic activity. Deletion of 78 residues at the carboxyl terminus of the cytoplasmic region did not influence activity, but an additional deletion of 13 amino acids from PTPase domain II totally abolished activity. Excision of the 21-residue acidic insert in the second PTPase domain resulted in a decrease of activity of approximately 4-fold. Nine conserved residues around the critical cysteine in the first domain were found to be important for activity. Of the 3 conserved tyrosine residues in domain I, only Tyr729 was specifically required for activity."

https://openalex.org/W1519036726,"Erythrocyte ankyrin is a member of a family of proteins that mediate the linkage between membrane proteins and the underlying spectrin-actin-based cytoskeleton. Ankyrin has been shown to interact with a variety of integral membrane proteins such as the anion exchanger, the Na+K(+)-ATPase, and the voltage-dependent sodium channel (NaCh) in brain. To understand how ankyrin interacts with these proteins and maintains its specificity and high affinity for the voltage-dependent NaCh, we have mapped the binding site on ankyrin for the NaCh by examining the binding of purified ankyrin subfragments, prepared by proteolytic cleavage, to the purified rat brain NaCh incorporated into liposomes. 125I-Labeled ankyrin and the radiolabeled 89- and 43-kDa fragments of ankyrin bind to the NaCh with high affinities and with Kd values of 34, 22, and 63 nM, respectively, and have stoichiometries of approximately 1 mol/mol NaCh. The 72-kDa spectrin binding domain is inactive and does not bind to the NaCh. Dissection of ankyrin reveals that the 43-kDa domain retains all the binding properties of native ankyrin to the NaCh. Analysis of the primary structure reveals that the NaCh binding site is confined to a domain of ankyrin consisting entirely of the 11 terminal 33-amino acid repeats and is distinct from the ankyrin domains that interact with spectrin and the Na+K(+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1511997163,"Using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) purified from rat cerebellum, we examined the subcellular distribution of IP3R in canine pancreatic homogenates. IP3R was present primarily in a microsomal fraction (low density), a (high density) rough microsomal (RM) fraction previously shown to consist of highly purified rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) vesicles, and, to a much lesser extent, in an intermediate density microsomal fraction which did not contain markers for RER or plasma membrane. When the RM fraction was subjected to isopycnic centrifugation on sucrose gradients, IP3R equilibrated at high sucrose densities. When ribosomes were extracted from the RM fraction by treatment with puromycin/high salt, IP3R equilibrated at considerably lighter sucrose densities. This shift in density indicated that IP3R which was present in the RM fraction is associated with the RER. Because of a significant amount of IP3R fractionating into the microsomal fraction (which contains plasma membrane, among other smooth membranes) and a considerable amount of IP3R present in the nuclear pellet which is also enriched in plasma membrane, we examined the possibility that IP3R may be present in plasma membrane. Further subfractionation of a crude plasma membrane pellet from rat liver revealed that IP3R coenriched with a plasma membrane marker and strongly suggested an association of IP3R with plasma membrane. The issue of why the same receptor is found in multiple biochemically and morphologically distinct membrane fractions is discussed in terms of the possibility of RER subcompartmentalization and IP3R subtypes. The fractionation pattern of IP3R in pancreas is significantly different from that previously reported for calcium (Ca2+)-binding proteins and an intracellular Ca-ATPase (Nigam, S. K. and Towers, T. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 111, 197-200), raising questions as to links between these latter proteins and IP3 sensitive Ca2+ pools. Nevertheless, although the fractionation patterns are different, all of these proteins are clearly associated with the RER."
https://openalex.org/W1505987379,"Factor X is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein that plays an essential role in both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. Studies on a recombinant lambda phage containing the 5'-flanking region of the human factor X gene showed that the factor X gene was linked to and was located at the 3' end of the factor VII gene: the initiation codon of the factor X gene was 2823 base pairs (bp) downstream from the polyadenylation site of the factor VII gene. This 2.8-kilobase intergenic region, and progressively deleted fragments of it, was fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, and transient expressions in HepG2 cells, human fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary cells were measured. A liver-specific promoter element, FXP1-binding site, essential for hepatocyte-specific transcription was identified. This promoter sequence, further localized to -63 to -42 bp in DNase I footprint studies, was homologous to LF-A1 or hepatic nuclear factor-4 recognition sequence and was equally functional in the normal and inverse orientations. FXP1 site bound to nuclear protein(s) from HepG2 cells and complex formation was partially abolished by the presence of duplex oligonucleotides containing liver factor-A1 or hepatic nuclear factor-4-binding sequences. Two additional positive elements located upstream of the promoter region, spanning from -215 to -149 bp (FXP2 site), and -457 to -351 bp (FXP3 site), were also established by reporter gene assays."
https://openalex.org/W1578362301,"Arrest of DNA replication in the terminus region of the Escherichia coli chromosome is mediated by protein-DNA complexes composed of the Tus protein and 23 base pair sequences generically called Ter sites. We have characterized the in vitro binding of purified Tus protein to a 37-base pair oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing the TerB sequence. The measured equilibrium binding constant (KD) for the chromosomal TerB site in KG buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM potassium glutamate, 25 degrees C, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 100 micrograms/ml bovine serum albumin) was 3.4 x 10(-13) M. Kinetic measurements in the same buffer revealed that the Tus-TerB complex was very stable, with a half-life of 550 min, a dissociation rate constant of 2.1 x 10(-5) s-1, and an association rate constant of 1.4 x 10(8) M-1 s-1. Similar measurements of Tus protein binding to the TerR2 site of the plasmid R6K showed an affinity 30-fold lower than the Tus-TerB interaction. This difference was due primarily to a more rapid dissociation of the Tus-TerR2 complex. Using standard chemical modification techniques, we also examined the DNA-protein contacts of the Tus-TerB interaction. Extensive contacts between the Tus protein and the TerB sequence were observed in the highly conserved 11 base-pair core sequence common to all identified Ter sites. In addition, protein-DNA contact sites were observed in the region of the Ter site where DNA replication is arrested. Projection of the footprinting data onto B-form DNA indicated that the majority of the alkylation interference and hydroxyl radical-protected sites were arranged on one face of the DNA helix. We also observed dimethyl sulfate protection of 2 guanine residues on the opposite side of the helix, suggesting that part of the Tus protein extends around the double helix. The distribution of contacts along the TerB sequence was consistent with the functional polarity of the Tus-Ter complex and suggested possible mechanisms for the impediment of protein translocation along DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1607924631,"Administration of 5 mg of progesterone to late pregnant rats induced an increase in myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors density detected by 125I-cyanopindolol binding. This increase was significant after 24 h (1.4-fold; p less than 0.05) and reached 1.6-fold (p less than 0.05) after 36 h. The antiprogestin RU 486 or cycloheximide completely suppressed the effect of progesterone injection. Quantification of the beta 1- and beta 2-receptor subtypes revealed that progesterone selectively up-regulated the beta 2-subtype. The increase in beta 2-adrenoreceptors was preceded by an elevation of their mRNA (2.3 kilobases) levels as determined by Northern blot hybridization with a rat heart beta 2-adrenoreceptor cDNA probe. This increase was significant after 18 h of exposure to progesterone (2.1-fold; p less than 0.05) and reached a maximum after 24 h (3.4-fold; p less than 0.01). The rate of beta 2-adrenergic gene transcription evaluated by nuclear run-on transcription assays, increased by 2.5-fold in myometria exposed for 4 h to progesterone. This study indicates that progesterone regulates myometrial beta 2-adrenergic receptor expression by controlling the rate of transcription of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1596833660,"A cDNA encoding mature porcine heart aconitase was over-expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of a phage T7 promoter. Recombinant aconitase purified from E. coli was identical to the enzyme from pig and beef heart in size, [3Fe-4S] and [4Fe-4S] cluster structure and enzymatic activity. Nine amino acid residues in close proximity to the Fe-S cluster and bound substrate (Lauble, H., Kennedy, M.C., Beinert, H., and Stout, C.D. (1992) Biochemistry, in press) were replaced by site-directed mutagenesis. Fe-S cluster environment as indicated by the EPR spectrum, tight binding of substrate, and enzymatic activity were compared for the mutant and wild type enzymes. Significant perturbations were detected for all of the mutant enzymes. Replacements for Asp100, His101, Asp165, Arg580, and Ser642 result in a 10(3)-10(5)-fold drop in activity, which suggests that these residues are involved in critical aspects of the reaction. Arg580 appears to be a key residue for substrate binding, as shown by a 30-fold increased Km and loss of tight substrate binding. Results of mutagenesis support the interpretation of the x-ray model, namely that Asp100 and His101 form an ion pair for elimination of the substrate hydroxyl and Ser642 may function as a general base for proton abstraction from citrate or isocitrate in the dehydration step and protonation of cis-aconitate in the hydration step. Asp165 appears to play a critical role in the interaction of Fea with substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1570557260,"Activin acts mitogenically on P19 cells as well as being inhibitory of the differentiation of retinoic acid-treated P19 cells and some neuroblastoma cell lines. Here, we show some lines of evidence that follistatin, an activin-binding protein, is also involved in neural differentiation. Counteracting the activity of activin, addition of follistatin suppresses the anchorage-independent growth of P19 cells in soft agar and stimulates neurite outgrowth of a neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32 cells. While activin does not seem to be expressed significantly, follistatin is demonstrated in the conditioned medium of these cells. Furthermore, the expression of follistatin in P19 cells is subject to dynamic fluctuations in response to retinoic acid treatment. These neural cells may produce follistatin in a cell stage-specific manner in order to interact with exogenously derived activin."
https://openalex.org/W2065227097,"In the hilar region of the rat hippocampus, large spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) mediated by non-NMDA glutamate receptors are present in both excitatory spiny mossy cells and inhibitory aspiny hilar interneurons, making these neurons ideal candidates for a comparative study using the tight seal whole-cell recording technique. Although sEPSCs have similar amplitude distributions, the rise and decay times are significantly slower in spiny versus aspiny neurons. Similar kinetic differences are observed in synaptic currents evoked by mossy fiber stimulation. These results demonstrate a physiological difference between the excitatory drive to excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the hilus that certainly contributes to differences in synaptic strength and that may be applicable to other brain regions. Furthermore, since the development or modification of individual spines or groups of spines may affect synaptic strength, these results may be pivotal in establishing a role for spines in modulating synaptic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1501069208,"The magnetic properties of the nickel(II) site in active Desulfovibrio baculatus (DSM 1743) [NiFeSe] hydrogenase have been measured using the multifield saturation magnetization technique. The periplasmic [NiFeSe] hydrogenase was isolated from bacteria grown in excess selenium in the presence of 57Fe. Saturation magnetization data were collected at three fixed fields (1.375, 2.75, 5.5 tesla) over the temperature range from 2 to 100 K. Mossbauer and EPR spectroscopies were used to characterize the magnetic state of the two [4Fe-4S] clusters of the enzyme and to quantitate the small amounts of iron impurities present in the sample. The nickel(II) site was found to be diamagnetic (low spin, S = 0). In combination with recent results from extended x-ray absorption fine structure studies, this magnetic state indicates that the nickel(II) site of active D. baculatus [NiFeSe] hydrogenase is five-coordinate."
https://openalex.org/W1534690515,"An agonist-induced change in the functional properties of a constant number of receptors seems to be a ubiquitous phenomenon involved in the regulation of cell surface receptors. Although the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon (called uncoupling or desensitization) have been studied in detail using beta 2-adrenergic receptors it is unclear if the models derived from these studies are applicable to other members of the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Since it has been shown previously that truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor results in a delay in the onset of agonist-induced uncoupling (Bouvier, M., Hausdorff, W.P., De Blasi, A., O'Dowd, B.F., Kobilka, B.K., Caron , M.G., and Lefkowitz, R.J. (1988) Nature 333, 370-373), we now present experiments designed to test the effects of a similar truncation of the lutropin/choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor on its functional properties. The results presented herein show that (i) clonal lines of human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding for the wild-type (rLHR-wt) or a mutant receptor truncated at amino acid residue 631 (rLHR-t631) express functional LH/CG receptors as judged by their ability to bind hCG and to respond to it with increased cAMP accumulation; (ii) a preincubation of the cells expressing rLHR-wt with hCG leads to a reduction in the ability of hCG to activate adenylylcyclase; and (iii) this reduction is severely blunted in cells expressing rLHR-t631. These results demonstrate that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the LH/CG receptor is necessary for agonist-induced uncoupling."
https://openalex.org/W1584215808,"The cellular retinoic acid-binding protein type II (CRABP-II) is a member of the serum and cytoplasmic retinoid-binding protein family. It is expressed during embryonic development and in adult skin and is upregulated by retinoic acid (RA) in F9 teratocarcinoma cells. We have determined the genomic organization of the murine CRABP-II gene and performed a detailed analysis of its transcriptional unit. The CRABP-II gene, located on mouse chromosome 2, is approximately 4.6 kilobases long and divided into four exons in a structure common to other members of the family of serum and cellular retinoid-binding proteins. Primer extension analysis and S1 nuclease protection assay were used to identify the transcription initiation site which is located 27 base pairs downstream of a typical TATAA box. Sequence analysis of the promoter also revealed a GC-rich region with overlapping putative SP1-binding sites at nucleotides -61 and AP-1 and AP-2-binding sites at nucleotides -518 and -544, respectively. The 3'-untranslated region contains two copies of the pentanucleotide AUUUA shown to be involved in messenger RNA destabilization. Consensus sequence for retinoic acid response elements were not detected in the promoter region of the CRABP-II gene. Results of nuclear run on experiments show that the CRABP-II gene is not transcriptionally activated by RA in F9 teratocarcinoma cells. These results suggest that the up-regulation of CRABP-II mRNA levels by RA is mainly controlled by a post-transcriptional mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1500915940,"While the components of the initiation complex at an RNA polymerase II basal promoter have been well characterized, few mechanistic studies have focused on how upstream DNA-binding, transcriptional activators influence protein assembly at the initiation site. Our analysis of basal transcription on both the simian virus 40 and adenovirus major late promoters demonstrates that two slow steps in initiation of transcription are the assembly of the general transcription factors TFIID and TFIIB onto the template DNA. On the simian virus 40 major late promoter, the rate of initiation complex formation is dramatically increased in the presence of the cellular transcriptional activator LSF. Direct analysis by band mobility shift assays demonstrates that LSF has no effect on the rate of binding, or the stability of TFIID on the promoter, predicting that LSF would not affect the template commitment step. Rather, kinetic analyses demonstrate that LSF reduces the lag in the rate of initiation complex formation attributable to the slow addition of TFIIB and suggest that LSF increases the rate of association of TFIIB with the committed template. In addition, LSF increases the total number of transcription complexes in long term assays, which is also consistent with LSF increasing the rate of association of TFIIB, where TFIIB is not saturating. These results indicate a mechanism for the activation of the initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription by one upstream activating protein, LSF. This mechanism may also be applicable to other activators that function in cases where limiting concentrations of TFIIB in the cell dictate slow binding of TFIIB."

https://openalex.org/W1603997051,"The superoxide-generating respiratory burst oxidase (NADPH oxidase) from human neutrophils can be activated in a cell-free system consisting of plasma membrane and cytosol by anionic amphiphiles such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and arachidonate (McPhail, L. C., Shirley, P. S., Clayton, C. C., and Snyderman, R. (1985) J. Clin. Invest. 75, 1735-1739; Curnutte, J. T. (1985) J. Clin. Invest. 75, 1740-1743; Bromberg, Y., and Pick, E. (1984) Cell. Immunol. 88, 213-221). Herein, the activity thus obtained is shown to be very labile at 37 degrees C. The rate of inactivation varied inversely with cytosol concentration. The stabilizing factor(s) was destroyed by heat and trypsin, indicating that it is protein in nature. Whereas cytosol from normal cells and from a chronic granulomatous disease patient lacking p67phox stabilized the oxidase activity, that from a chronic granulomatous disease patient lacking p47phox did not. Also, dialdehyde NADPH-treated cytosol showed no stabilizing effect, indicating that p47phox and a putative NADPH-binding component both participate in stabilization. The mechanism of inactivation was further explored by examining the stabilizing effect of agents that can act as chemical cross-linkers. Of several tested, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) was the most effective, but others that utilize different chemical mechanisms were also partially effective. EDC extended the half-life at 37 degrees C from 2 to 120 min, protected against the inactivating effects of Triton X-100 and high salt, and did not affect the Km for NADPH. Stabilization required prior activation in the presence of both cytosol and membrane; and EDC treatment of cytosol, membrane, or a mixture of the two prior to the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate failed to induce stabilization. EDC eliminated the requirement for the continuous presence of cytosol and activator. Dialysis did not cause a loss in activity, whereas control activity was diminished with dialysis and was largely restored with added sodium dodecyl sulfate. In the absence of EDC, the separation of cytosol from the membrane fraction resulted in a significant loss of activity, which was largely restored by the addition of cytosol. However, EDC treatment allowed the isolation of a nearly fully active oxidase in the membrane fraction, the activity of which was not influenced by added cytosol. These results support a model in which the active NADPH oxidase consists of a dissociable complex among membrane and cytosolic components and indicate that the longevity of the activated state requires continuous association of these components."

https://openalex.org/W1562665201,"Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) is cleaved at the tetrabasic residue site, in pituitary intermediate lobe secretory vesicles, to yield ACTH1-17 and corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide (CLIP). ACTH1-17 is then converted to alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (N-AcACTH1-13NH2) by first removing the Lys15-Lys16-Arg17 residues, followed by amidation of the COOH terminus and acetylation of the NH2 terminus. Bovine intermediate lobe secretory vesicle membranes were screened for proteolytic enzyme activity that will cleave the tetrabasic residues of ACTH. Two activities with pH optima of 5.0-6.0 and 7.5-8.0 were detected. The acidic, ACTH-converting enzyme cleaved ACTH1-39 at the tetrabasic residues between the Arg17-Arg18 bond to yield ACTH1-17 and CLIP, but did not cleave paired basic residues of pro-opiomelanocortin. This enzyme activity was characterized as a Ca(2+)-activated serine protease with unique specificity for the tetrabasic residues of ACTH1-39. The neutral activity preferentially generated ACTH1-17 and to a small extent ACTH1-16 from ACTH1-39 and ACTH1-24. This enzyme activity was Ca(2+)-dependent but was not inhibited by serine or aspartic protease inhibitors. The neutral activity was significantly immunodepleted by antiserum raised against bovine PC2/PC3, and together with specificity studies, suggests that the enzyme is a PC2-like serine protease. The pH optimum, distinct specificity for tetrabasic residues, and subcellular localization of the acidic ACTH-converting enzyme indicate a function of this enzyme in the in vivo conversion of ACTH1-39 to alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in intermediate lobe secretory vesicles which have an acidic internal pH."

https://openalex.org/W1548732674,"Ferredoxins are proteins which contain iron and inorganic sulfide and are capable of electron transport. They are found in a wide range of organisms, from anaerobic bacteria, to plants and mammals. Although NMR spectroscopy has been used to study ferredoxins since the 1970s, little important structural or biochemical information has resulted from these investigations. The major difficulty has been the effect of the paramagnetic iron-sulfur clusters on the peptide resonances, hindering nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) studies and causing broad line widths. These effects are most pronounced on resonances arising from the nuclei closest to the iron-sulfur center. Unfortunately, these are likely to be the most interesting nuclei, as they report the events and geometry in the vicinity of the active sites. In this paper, the first direct assignment of beta-cysteinyl 13C resonances for any iron-sulfur protein is reported for the spectrum of Pseudomonas putida ferredoxin. These resonances are of special significance, as they arise from the atoms on the protein closest to the iron centers, with the exception of the directly bound cysteinyl sulfur atoms. In addition, cysteinyl and ring system 1H NMR resonance assignments are made for the spectra of P. putida ferredoxin and Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I."

https://openalex.org/W1581449167,"The main objective of the current study was to investigate the factors that affect brush border membrane expression of intrinsic factor-cobalamin receptor (IFCR). Because of high levels of IFCR expression (Seetharam, B., Levine, J. S., Ramasamy, M., and Alpers, D. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 4443-4449) in the rat kidney, we have studied the synthesis and expression of IFCR using rat cortical slices in culture. The IFCR activity in the renal apical brush border was maximum from rats between the age of 20-24 days and about 75% of the activity was lost from the isolated apical surface membranes following culture of cortical slices with nonradioactive intrinsic factor-cobalamin. However, the membrane IFCR activity recovered to 100 or 75%, respectively, when the slices were cultured with intrinsic factor-cobalamin mixed with either leupeptin or chloroquine. When these lysosomotropic agents were added during the metabolic labeling of the cortical slices with trans-35S-label neither the synthesis nor the amount of [35S]IFCR transported to the apical membrane was inhibited. However, with the addition of colchicine, the apical membrane expression of [35S]IFCR was inhibited by 75-80%. Metabolic labeling of cortical slices with trans-35S-label and immunoprecipitation of the Triton X-100 extract from the total, internal, and apical membranes revealed the presence of a 230-kDa band following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. With either continuous or pulse-chase labeling of the cortical slices, the amount of 230-kDa [35S]IFCR recovered in the apical membrane did not exceed 10-15% of the total labeled receptor synthesized. Based on these and our recent studies (Seetharam, S., Dahms, N., Li, N., Ramanujam, K.S., and Seetharam, B. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 177, 751-756), we propose that rat renal IFCR is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain of 220 kDa and is transported slowly to the apical membrane during which four or five N-linked oligosaccharides are processed to the complex type. Moreover, the brush border expression of IFCR is regulated by the biosynthetic and not by the endocytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1484518266,"We have recently identified and sequenced the cDNA for an opioid-binding protein with homologies to cell adhesion molecules (OBCAM) (Schofield, P. R., McFarlard, K. C., Hayflick, J. S., Wilcox, J. N., Cho, T. M., Roy, S., Lee, N. M., Loh, H. H., and Seeburg, P. H. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 489-495). Several lines of evidence using antibodies suggest that OBCAM may play a functional role in NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma cells, a useful model system that contains a homogeneous population of delta-opioid receptors. A logical extension of this research is to further test this hypothesis. As part of this study, NG108-15 cells were stably transfected with either sense or antisense sequences of a portion of pROM, the rat cDNA for OBCAM. [3H] Diprenorphine binding was greatly reduced in antisense-transfected cells relative to non-transfected cells. Binding to alpha 2-adrenergic, muscarinic, and insulin receptors was unaffected. These results further support the notion that OBCAM or its analogue is part (or a subunit) of an opioid receptor. Furthermore, our observation of an apparently specific reduction in opioid binding in these transfected cells suggests that they may provide a novel genetic approach for studying regulation of the opioid receptor in this defined cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1527618135,"Rad3 protein from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase which catalyzes the unwinding of DNA.DNA duplexes. In the present studies we have demonstrated that the purified enzyme additionally catalyzes the displacement of RNA fragments annealed to complementary DNA. Quantitative comparisons using otherwise identical partially duplex DNA.DNA and DNA.RNA substrates indicate a significant preference for the latter. Competition for ATPase or DNA helicase activity by various homopolymers suggests that Rad3 protein does not discriminate between ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide homopolymers with respect to binding. However, neither single-stranded RNA nor various ribonucleotide homopolymers supported the hydrolysis of nucleoside 5'-triphosphates. Additionally, Rad3 protein was unable to catalyze the displacement of oligo(dA) annealed to poly(U), suggesting that the catalytic domain of the enzyme is exquisitely sensitive to chemical and/or or conformational differences between DNA and RNA. Hence, it appears that Rad3 protein is not an RNA helicase."

https://openalex.org/W1516495783,"An alpha-helix terminates when the virtual extension of its most hydrophobic, longitudinal strip containing Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Met lacks those residues. In each of 247 helices a template was fitted to maximize the mean hydrophobicity of positions forming a longitudinal strip-of-helix. The template was then extended into sequences beyond the ends of the helices. Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Met occurred in positions in the longitudinal strip-of-helix at an increased frequency (p less than 0.001), but in the first and second positions beyond either end of each true helix, they occurred at the same frequency as for their empirical distribution over all the proteins. Excesses of Asp and Glu were found in the N-terminal loop, and of Arg, His, and Lys in specific positions about the C terminus of helices. The longitudinal hydrophobic strip, the smallest amino acid in that strip, and charged amino acids in that strip, related to rotational and longitudinal orientation of alpha-helices in 15 proteins. Adjacent helices generally crossed through their longitudinal hydrophobic strips. They usually crossed through the smallest residue in the strip. Charged residues, when they occurred in the strips, were excluded from the crossing regions."
https://openalex.org/W1501625585,"We have previously shown that glucocorticoids regulate the trafficking and processing of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) proteins in viral-infected M1.54 rat hepatoma cells. To examine the role of intracellular membrane integrity on MMTV protein maturation, brefeldin A (BFA) was utilized to disrupt membrane flow between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that in the presence of dexamethasone, BFA inhibited the proteolytic processing, cell surface delivery, and externalization of MMTV glycoproteins. Glycosidase digestion and inhibitors of protein glycosylation confirmed that the observed differences in apparent sizes of MMTV glycoprotein products are due to BFA-induced changes in oligosaccharide processing. BFA treatment inhibited the proteolytic processing of the MMTV phosphoprotein precursor, which normally associates with the cytoplasmic face of intracellular membranes. Similarities in salt extraction efficiency revealed that BFA did not affect the membrane affinity of the uncleaved phosphorylated precursor. In a complementary approach, proteolytic processing of the phosphorylated polyprotein did not occur in glucocorticoid-treated HTC cells transfected with a mutant MMTV provirus encoding a normal phosphorylated precursor, but which express a truncated MMTV glycoprotein missing its transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. These results suggest that the MMTV glycoproteins and phosphoproteins may interact at a late step in the transport pathway in a manner required for their mutual processing in response to glucocorticoids and establishes the importance of functional interactions with intracellular membranes for maturation of the cytoplasmic MMTV phosphoproteins."
