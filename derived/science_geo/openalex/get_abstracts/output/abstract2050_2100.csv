https://openalex.org/W1520021552,"A potent (Na,K)-ATPase inhibitor purified from Sigma Grade* ATP has been identified as vanadium using electron probe microanalysis and confirmed by microwave-induced emission spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Sodium orthovanadate (Na3 VO4) is identical with the purified inhibitor with respect to ultraviolet absorbance, migration on thin layer chromatography, and inhibition of (Na,K)-ATPase. The (Na,K)-ATPase is in-inhibited 50% by 40 nM Na3 VO4 under optimal conditions (28 mM Mg2+) and the inhibition is 100% reversible by millimolar concentrations of norepinephrine. The physiological significance of this inhibition is discussed in relation to vanadium concentrations in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2031424457,"Duodenal calcium absorption and a vitamin D-dependent duodenal calcium-binding protein are depressed in rats with alloxan- or streptozotocin-induced diabetes. To test for possible abnormal vitamin D metabolism in diabetes we measured serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in control, streptozotocin diabetic, and insulin-treated diabetic rats. The serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was depressed in untreated diabetic rats to one-eighth of the level in controls and was restored to control levels by insulin treatment. The serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was the same in all three groups. Hence, effects of diabetes on duodenal calcium transport can be explained by reduced concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D resulting either from failure of renal 1α-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D or increased catabolism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D."

https://openalex.org/W1597059690,"Effects of triiodothyronine treatment on (Na+,K+)-ATPase in the brain, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle were studied in the rat. The number of (Na+,K+)-ATPase units in the particulate fractions obtained from deoxycholate-treated homogenates was estimated from the concentration of [3H]ouabain binding sites assayed with a labeled drug-displacement method. The concentration of [3H]ouabain binding sites was highest in the brain tissue, intermediate in the kidney, and relatively low in the liver and skeletal muscle. The affinity of the binding sites for ouabain was highest in the brain, intermediate in the skeletal muscle, low in the kidney, and lowest in the liver. Triiodothyronine treatment increased the [3H]ouabain binding site concentration in the liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle but failed to affect it in the brain. Affinity of the binding sites for ouabain was unchanged by the triiodothyronine treatment in all tissues studied. These data indicate that triiodothyronine treatment of rats results in an increased tissue concentration of (Na+,K+)-ATPase in the liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, but not in the brain. These changes do not accompany marked changes in the characteristics of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1496082479,"We have purified a cofactor protein previously shown (Pollard, T. D., and Korn, E. D. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4691-4697) to be required for actin activation of the Mg2+-ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin I. The purified cofactor protein is a novel myosin kinase that phosphorylates the single heavy chain, but neither of the two light chains, of Acanthamoeba myosin I. Phosphorylation of Acanthamoeba myosin I by the purified cofactor protein requires ATP and Mg2+ but is Ca2+-independent. The Mg2+-ATPase activity of phosphorylated Acanthamoeba myosin I is highly activated by F-actin in the absence of cofactor protein. Actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity is lost when phosphorylated Acanthamoeba myosin I is dephosphorylated by platelet phosphatase. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation have no effect on the (K+,EDTA)-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase activities of Acanthamoeba myosin I. These results show that cofactor protein is an Acanthamoeba myosin I heavy chain kinase and that phosphorylation of the heavy chain of this myosin is required for actin activation of its Mg2+-ATPase activity."

These findings suggest that ingesting crude oil causes multiple sublethal effects that might impair a bird's ability to survive at sea."

https://openalex.org/W1508771961,"Addition of serum to quiescent cultures of 3T3 cells markedly enhances the specific activity of phosphofructokinase assayed in centrifuged homogenates. The effect depends on both serum concentration and the time of exposure to serum. Mixing experiments, mearsurements of the enzyme at different pH values and persistence of the activation after Sephadex chromatography render unlikely the possibility that activators or inhibitors play a significant role in the stimulation of phosphofructokinase by serum. In addition to serum, epidermal growth factor and insulin also enhance the activity of phosphofructokinase. The activation occurs in the presence of 30 microgram/ml of cycloheximide. It is not the result of a high glycolytic flux because drugs (dinitrophenol and oligomycin) that interfere with ATP synthesis and are potent stimulators of glycolysis in intact cells fail to increase phosphofructokinase activity and because the growth-promoting factors increase the enzyme activity in glucose-free medium. Thus, the activation of phosphofructokinase activity appears specifically related to the action of growth-promoting factors and it may offer an experimental system to investigate the chemical signals or cellular conditions, or both, that lead to rapid cell proliferation."

The bifunctional maleimide, o-phenylenedimaleimide (OPDM), inhibits photophosphorylation in spinach chloro- plast thylakoids at concentrations as low as 100 nM and is therefore, about 500-fold more effective than N-ethylma- leimide. Thylakoids must be illuminated in the presence of this reagent prior to the assay of photophosphorylation for the irreversible inhibition to be expressed. Uncouplers and adenosine 5’-triphosphate plus inorganic phosphate largely prevent the development of the inhibition. 2. Phosphorylation in thylakoids treated with OPDM in the light is uncoupled from electron flow. The extent of the light-induced uptake of protons is decreased by the light and OPDM treatment, indicating that treated thylakoid membranes have enhanced permeability to protons. N,N’- Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide restores H+ uptake in OPDM- treated thylakoids. 3. N-Phenylmaleimide is only slightly more effective than N-ethylmaleimide as an inhibitor of phosphorylation. Thus, the bifunctionality of OPDM, rather than its hydrophobic- ity, accounts for its potency. Although incubation of thyla- koids with N-ethylmaleimide in the dark does not affect the light-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation by N-ethyl- maleimide, it abolishes the ability of low concentrations of OPDM to inhibit. Moreover, thylakoids incubated with OPDM in the dark followed by removal of the unreacted OPDM show inhibited rates of phosphorylation after illu- mination in the absence of nucleotides or sulfhydryl com- pounds. 4. [‘CIOPDM is incorporated into the y and E subunits of coupling factor 1 (CF,) in thylakoids to the same extent in the light as in the dark. No other chloroplast protein was labeled to a significant extent by the OPDM. Less cysteine reacts with OPDM bound to the y subunit of CF, in thylakoids which had been illuminated in the presence of the OPDM than in thylakoids which had been incubated with OPDM in the dark. 5. Thus, OPDM appears to react with a readily accessible group on the y subunit in the dark. The other maleimide"
https://openalex.org/W2111698948,"Initiator methionine tRNA from the mitochondria of Neurospora crassa has been purified and sequenced. This mitochondrial tRNA can be aminoacylated and formylated by E. coli enzymes, and is capable of initiating protein synthesis in E. coli extracts. The nucleotide composition of the mitochondrial initiator tRNA (the first mitochondrial tRNA subjected to sequence analysis) is very rich in A + U, like that reported for total mitochondrial tRNA. In two of the unique features which differentiate procaryotic from eucaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs, the mitochondrial tRNA appears to resemble the eucaryotic initiator tRNAs. Thus unlike procaryotic initiator tRNAs in which the 5′ terminal nucleotide cannot form a Watson-Crick base pair to the fifth nucleotide from the 3′ end, the mitochondrial tRNA can form such a base pair; and like the eucaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs, the mitochondrial initiator tRNA lacks the sequence -TΨCG(or A) in loop IV. The corresponding sequence in the mitochondrial tRNA, however, is -UGCA- and not -AU(or Ψ)CG-as found in all eucaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs. In spite of some similarity of the mitochondrial initiator tRNA to both eucaryotic and procaryotic initiator tRNAs, the mitochondrial initiator tRNA is basically different from both these tRNAs. Between these two classes of initiator tRNAs, however, it is more homologous in sequence to procaryotic (56–60%) than to eucaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs (45–51%)."

https://openalex.org/W1494831128,Isolated beta subunit of ATPase (F1) from yeast mitochondria does not catalyze an ATPase reaction but still binds the specific F1 inhibitor aurovertin. Binding was measured by enhancement of aurovertin fluorescence; it was as tight as that to F1-ATPase. No binding was observed with F1 or with isolated beta subunit from a single-gene nuclear yeast mutant whose F1-ATPase was resistant to aurovertin.

https://openalex.org/W1569174183,"In order to learn whether the kinetics of transient phosphorylation of sodium plus potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase was compatible with the hydrolysis of ATP, computer simulation of experimental data was studied. The enzyme mechanism was described in terms of first order and pseudo-first order reactions. The resulting system of linear first order differential equations was solved by a Runge-Kutta method. Phosphorylation kinetics was studied by means of a rapid mixing apparatus at 21 degrees in the presence of 100 micron ATP, 3 mM MgCl2, 120 mM NaCl, and 10 mM KCl. Computer simulation gave a close fit to experimental data with a model of the reaction mechanism which included a sequence of two dephospho forms and two phospho forms of the enzyme. With this model, rate constants obtained by computer simulation were in agreement with constants which had been determined in separate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation experiments. Within experimental limits, the net flux of reaction in each partial step was compatible with the (Na+,K+)-stimulated hydrolysis of ATP (about 324 and 300 nmol-mg-1-min-1, respectively)."

Molecules of alpha-actinin as an adsorbed monolayer on the surface of polystyrene Lytron particles could bind muscle-actin and tropomyosin from solution. Both the ATPase activity and superprecipitation of an erythrocyte-actin and muscle-myosin hybrid actomyosin complex were altered by alpha-actinin, while tropomyosin diminished these alpha-actinin effects. The binding properties of alpha-actinin are consistent with those of an anchoring protein for microfilaments in nonmuscle cells."

https://openalex.org/W107659928,"Myosin from the hearts of thyrotoxic animals (myosin-T) exhibits elevated Ca2+-ATPase activity. To clarify the physiological significance of this increased activity, we have investigated the steady state kinetics of the interaction of actin and MgATP with the double-headed heavy meromyosin subfragment of cardiac myosin from thyrotoxic rabbits (HMM-T). The enhanced Ca2+-ATPase activity of myosin-T was completely retained in HMM-T. The Vmax for actin-activated MgATP hydrolysis by HMM-T (1.08 +/- 0.10 mumol of Pi/mg/min). Under physiological ionic conditions, the Vmax was 0.14 +/- 0.02 mumol of Pi/mg/min as compared with the normal value of 0.08 +/- 0.01 mumol of Pi/mg/min. Furthermore, the salt dependence of Vmax and Kapp for the actin-activated ATPase of HMM-T differed markedly from normal and resembled that usually associated with the single-headed (S1) cleavage product of myosin. These results suggest that the changes in enzymatic properties of myosin-T are responsible for the increased speed of contraction observed in the hearts of thyrotoxic animals. Also, the alteration in the interaction of HMM-T with actin suggests that a loss of cooperativity between the myosin heads may occur."

https://openalex.org/W1541861591,"The initial steps of carnitine biosynthesis in Neurospora crassa involve the methylation of the epsilon-amino group of lysine as follows: Lysine A leads to monomethyllysine B leads to dimethyllysine C leads to trimethyllysine. The methyl donor is S-adenosylmethionine. An enzyme, S-adenosylmethionine:epsilon-N-L-lysine methyltransferase, has been purified from N. crassa to near homogeneity as judged by column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ultracentrifugation. This protein catalyzes all three methylation reactions. The reaction rates are: A less than B less than C. Sedimentation equilibrium and molecular filtration give a molecular weight of 22,000 for the protein. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the protein in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis do not detect the possibility of subunit structure. The enzyme contains no half-cystine but does contain several acidic residues. The protein exhibits an absorption band between 400 and 420 nm which is 40 to 50 times less than the absorption seen at 280 nm and is not affected by the presence of substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2132634880,"Abstract Two major forms of native sheep plasminogen (SPg-a) have been isolated from plasma by affinity chromatography. These forms differ in molecular weight, charge characteristics, affinity for epsilon-aminocaproic acid (epsilon-Ahx), and carbohydrate content. Upon treatment of SPg-a with plasmin, lower molecular weight plasminogens can be isolated. A plasminogen (SPg-b) of molecular weight approximately 8,000 less than native plasminogen is rapidly produced when either major plasminogen form is treated with plasmin. The molecular weight differences found in the major SPg-a forms are retained in the SPg-b forms, derived from each SPg-a. Upon protracted treatment of either major form of SPg-a or SPg-b with plasmin, a plasminogen (SPg-c) or molecular weight approximately 32,000 less than SPg-b is produced. A single peptide (P) is also produced in this step. The SPg-c species produced from each original SPg-a major form possess essentially the same molecular weights and carbohydrate compositions; but the P cleaved retains the molecular weight and carbohydrate differences found in each major SPg-a or SPg-b form. A large decrease in the S20,w of SPg-a is observed upon the binding of epsilon-Ahx to this protein. A much smaller alteration in the S20,w of SPg-b and SPg-c is observed upon binding of epsilon-Ahx to these proteins."

Abys were isolated from two different antisera and the effects on (Na+,K+)-ATPase hydrolytic activity and [3H]ouabain binding were measured. The antisera fractions differed as to their maximum level of inhibition of hydrolytic activity and maximal [3H]ouabain binding, but both fractions caused inhibition of maximal [3H]ouabain binding to the same quantitative extent as inhibition of hydrolytic activity. Variable effects on the rate of [3H]ouabain binding were noted which were highly dependent on ligand conditions. During the turnover state conditions of the enzyme, the abys stimulated the rate of [3H]ouabain binding to the (Na+,K+)-ATPase. We conclude that effects of aby-(Na+,K+)-ATPase interaction depend upon degree of purity of aby, specificity, aby/enzyme ratios, and ligand conditions."

Density gradient experiments showed that the ghost preparations remained intact following trypsin treatment. Evidence was obtained that 125I-trypsin failed to penetrate the ghost membranes. Thus, attempts were made to determine whether the ATPase molecule in the ghost membranes is accessible from the outer surface. Treatment of protoplast ghosts and trypsin-treated ghosts with 125I by the lactoperoxidase method resulted in the labeling of ATPase only in the trypsin-treated ghost preparations. The antibody to latent ATPase inhibited ATPase activity in trypsin-treated ghosts. The changes in the fluorescence polarization of diphenyl hexatriene indicated that trypsin treatment of the ghost membranes resulted in an increase in membrane fluidity. These studies suggest that the latent ATPase moiety has undergone translocation to the outer surface or it became accessible to trypsin digestion from the outer surface of the membranes as a result of removal of some proteins covering ATPase molecule in the membranes."

Neither fraction catalyzed ATP-linked transhydrogenase activity. Mixtures of unsolubilized fractions of the untreated bacteria with solubilized fractions of either the treated or untreated bacteria yielded reconstituted membranes with restored ATP-linked transhydrogenase activity. The level of the activity was similar to that of the undissociated membranes of untreated bacteria. The membranes which were reconstituted from unsolubilized fractions of the treated bacteria and the solubilized fraction of the treated or the untreated bacteria showed impairment of activity. The impairment is not due to an inability to bind ATPase of the soluble fraction or to an incorrect binding of the ATPase. The impaired, reconstituted membranes showed striking decreases in the relative amounts of three proteins with apparent molecular weights of 122,000, 73,000, and 62,000. The affected proteins were found to be components of the unsolubilized membrane fraction. It is, thus, concluded that the impaired activity is due to the defective nature of the unsolubilized membrane fraction of colicin-treated cells."
