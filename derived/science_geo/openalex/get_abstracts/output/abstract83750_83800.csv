https://openalex.org/W2092554038,"Microinfusion of 5-thioglucose into either the lateral or fourth cerebral ventricle caused increased feeding and hyperglycemia in rats when the cerebral aqueduct was unobstructed. If the aqueduct was obstructed and 5-thioglucose was infused into the fourth ventricle, increased feeding and hyperglycemia persisted, whereas feeding and hyperglycemia in response to lateral ventricle infusion were abolished. Drinking in response to infusion of angiotensin II into the lateral ventricle was not diminished by aqueduct obstruction. These results indicate that glucoreceptors that mediate feeding and hyperglycemia in response to cerebral glucoprivation are located in the caudal hindbrain and not in the hypothalamus where they have previously been sought."

The membranes are resistant to structural disordering by both ethanol and halothane. Tolerance, cross-tolerance, and dependence in chronic alcoholics may in part result from membrane alterations that inhibit the binding of ethanol and other drugs."

https://openalex.org/W1969041711,"Recombinant DNA techniques were used to analyze the structure of the messenger RNA encoding a precursor of calcitonin, a small calcium-regulating hormone of 32 amino acids. Analyses of the nucleotide sequences of cloned complementary DNA's comprising the entire coding sequence of the messenger RNA revealed that calcitonin is flanked at both its amino and carboxyl termini by peptide extensions linked to the hormone by short sequences of basic amino acids. The location of glycine next to the carboxyl terminal prolinamide of calcitonin is consistent with indications that glycine is required for the enzymatic amidation of proline to the prolinamide. During cellular biosynthesis, calcitonin arises from a large precursor protein by cleavages at both amino and carboxyl terminal residues of the hormone. These findings raise questions concerning the regulation of these cleavages and the potential biological functions of the precursor extensions derived from these cleavages."

https://openalex.org/W2010400408,Benzodiazepines inhibit Ca2+-calmodulin-stimulated membrane protein phosphorylation. The effects of the benzodiazepines on protein phosphorylation are stereospecific and produced by membrane-bound benzodiazepine. The potency of benzodiazepine kinase inhibition is correlated with the ability of the benzodiazepines to inhibit electric shock-induced convulsions. These findings provide evidence that some of the anticonvulsant and neuronal stabilizing effects of benzodiazepines may be modulated by the Ca2+-calmodulin protein kinase system and indicate that this calmodulin-kinase system represents an identifiable benzodiazepine receptor in brain that is distinquishable by several criteria from the previously described high affinity benzodiazepine receptor.
https://openalex.org/W2063516905,"To assess the relative contributions of germline versus somatically mutated genes in the human immune system, we have examined the size of the kappa light-chain variable region (V kappa) gene pool. Two cloned kappa subgroup 1 (V kappa 1) gene probes detected the same family of 15 to 20 crosshybridizing restriction fragments in human DNA, whereas flanking region probes detected fewer hybridizing fragments. Most of the hybridizing bands represent single-copy genes, as judged by a ""'gene titration"" experiment. Furthermore, the number of hybridization bands is a good estimate of the haploid gene number, since we observed little polymorphism of restriction sites in the V kappa locus of eight unrelated people. A cloned V kappa 3 probe hybridized to essentially the same 15--20 genes in human DNA as the V kappa 1 probes. These results strongly suggest that a discrete family of 15--20 genes constitutes a large proportion of the V genes from three of the four V kappa subgroups. The small number of V kappa genes in the human genome supports the idea that somatic mutation plays a major role in the origin of antibody diversity in man."

https://openalex.org/W2108826485,"We have collected electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectra from the hydrogen peroxide compound of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase, termed ES, employing EPR microwave frequencies of 9.6 and 11.6 GHz. We have measured and analyzed the temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) of the paramagnetic center of ES over the temperature range 1.9 to 4 K. In addition, an upper bound to exchange coupling between the ferryl heme and EPR-visible centers of ES has been calculated and expressions for the dipolar interaction between a ferryl heme and a free radical have been derived. These results all confirm that the EPR signal of ES is not associated with an aromatic amino acid radical, and in particular not with a tryptophanyl radical. This conclusion has led us to consider an explanation of the EPR signal in terms of a nucleophilically stabilized methionyl radical."

https://openalex.org/W1579040796,"7,8-benzoflavone or flavone stimulates the hydroxylation of benzo(a)pyrene by liver microsomes from rabbit, hamster, and man severalfold. Little or no activation by the flavonoid occurs in liver microsomes from rat or guinea pig. Intact liver microsomal membranes are not required for the activation. Although 7,8-benzoflavone does not stimulate the NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c by rabbit liver microsomes, the NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome P-450 is stimulated by 7,8-benzoflavone either in the presence or absence of benzo(a)pyrene. Purified cytochrome P-450 reductase causes an increase in the rate of benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation in cholate-solubilized liver microsomes from all of the species studied. In cholate-solubilized microsomes from all of the species susceptible for flavonoid activation, 7,8-benzoflavone decreases the K/sub m/ for cytochrome P-450 reductase and increases the V/sub max/ for benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation. With cholate-solubilized human liver microsomes, the K/sub m/ for cytochrome P-450 reductase in the absence of flavonoids was about 3-fold higher than in the presence of 100 ..mu..M 7,8-benzoflavone or 500 ..mu..M flavone. 7,8-benzoflavone and flavone stimulate the hydroxylation of benzo(a)pyrene in liver microsomes at least in part by enhancing the interaction between cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome P-450 reductase. 7,8-benzoflavone does not influence the K/sub m/ for benzo(a)pyrene or NADPH, but themore » V/sub max/ values for benzo(a)pyrene are increased from 2.5- to 4-fold in rabbit liver microsomes. 7,8-benzoflavone does not stimulate the cumene hydroperoxide-dependent hydroxylation of benzo(a)pyrene by rabbit liver microsomes. In two partially purified cytochrome P-450 fractions from rabbit liver microsomes, flavone has a specific stimulatory effect on one of the reconstituted partially purified cytochrome P-450 systems, but an inhibitory effect on the other.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2131635619,"The biological activity of fragments of the SV40 genome was determined by manual microinjection of the fragments into the nuclei of mammalian cells. Fragments of the SV40 A gene (that codes for the T antigens) were obtained either directly by digestion with restriction endonucleases or after cloning into plasmid pBR322. Three different biological activities were studied: expression of T antigen, induction of cell DNA synthesis, and, in a few cases, reactivation of repressed ribosomal RNA genes. By using a number of fragments with deletions in the various portions of the SV40 A gene, we have been able to conclude that: 1) the sequences from 0.65 to 0.51 map units are not needed for the induction of cell DNA synthesis; 2) the sequences from 0.42 to 0.17 map units are not needed for the induction of cell DNA synthesis; and 3) the critical sequences for the induction of cell DNA synthesis, 0.51 to 0.42 map units, are different from those necessary for the reactivation of repressed ribosomal RNA genes (0.39-0.33 map units). These results indicate that the information for these two fundamental processes of cell proliferation resides in two separate and distinct domains of the SV40 A gene."

https://openalex.org/W2024429763,A plasmid DNA structure (approximate molecular weight = 7.5 X 10(6)) was identified in the human pathogen Treponema pallidum (Nichols). The inability to isolate this plasmid from rabbit host tissue and the total lack of DNA homology of the plasmid with rabbit DNA has confirmed its Treponema pallidum origin. The observation documents a newly recognized and potentially significant genetic capability for Treponema pallidum.

https://openalex.org/W2038043114,The inability of pathogenic animal viruses to be completely neutralized by antibodies can lead to chronic viral infections in which infectious virus persists even in the presence of excess neutralizing antibody. A mechanism that results in this nonneutralized fraction of virus was defined by the topographical relationships of viral epitopes identified with monoclonal antibodies wherein monoclonal antibodies bind to virus and sterically block the binding of neutralizing antibodies.
https://openalex.org/W1569098185,"cells responded to luteinizing hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, isoproterenol, and cholera toxin with an increase in progesterone and cyclic AMP responses. Administration of 4-aminopyrazolo(3,4~)p~midine (4-UP) (12.5 mgfkg body weight) for 3 consecutive days reduced the circulating cholesterol level from 47.32 2 1.12 mg/dl to 8.16 & 0.43 mg/dl and plasma progesterone from 280 f 26 ng/ml to 96 k 6 ng/ ml. Cellular sterol ester content was reduced to 25% following 4-APP injection. Injection of drug also produced a small but significant decrease in luteal cell free cholesterol. Treatment of rats with 4-APP also reduced the in vitro basal and hormone-stimulated progesterone production. This treatment showed no effect on luteal cell ‘251-human chorionic gonadotropin binding or gonadotropin and cholera toxin stimulated cyclic AMP synthesis. Exposure of luteal cells isolated from control and 4-APP injected groups to homologous or heterologous lipoproteins (low and high density lipoproteins) produced significant stimulation in steroidogenesis, both under basal conditions and in response to gonadotropins. Similarly, luteal cells isolated from 4APP-injected rats incorporated [3H]cholesterol from [3~~cholesteryl linoleate into progesterone at a much faster rate compared to control cells, and this effect was further enhanced in response to human chorionic gonadotropin. Injection of rats with Triton WR 1339 (1 g/kg body weight) resulted in a 10-fold increase in circulating cholesterol level. This treatment, however, produced a significant decrease in plasma progesterone and cyclic AMP and progesterone responses in isolated cells. The inhibitory effect of Triton injection on steroidogenesis could not be reversed by lipoprotein addition. These studies suggest that rat luteal cells are acutely dependent upon exogenous lipoprotein cholesterol for the maximum expression of steroidogenic response."

Each onc gene counterpart has a single genetic locus, which probably contains non-onc intervening sequences. The human DNA sequences may represent genes important to cell growth or cell differentiation, or both.

https://openalex.org/W1501272646,"Abstract When the effect of diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate on a purified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase reaction was examined, the compound strongly inhibited ADP-ribosylation reaction of histone, while the compound was much less inhibitory of the Mg2+-dependent automodification of this enzyme. In an attempt to study the mechanism of the inhibition, we analyzed the total reaction products, which were synthesized from NAD+ in the presence of diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate in a reaction mixture for ADP-ribosylation of histone, and found that a new, low molecular product was predominantly synthesized instead of ADP-ribosylated histone in the reaction. Approximately 90% of added NAD+ was converted into this low molecular product under an appropriate reaction condition. Further analysis revealed that the product was mono- and oligo(ADP-ribosyl)ated diadenosine nucleotide and that the bound oligo(ADP-ribose) is elongating at one end of the product during the reaction. Thus, the present study clearly demonstrated that diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate functions as an acceptor for ADP-ribose in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase reaction in vitro. The finding that histone H1 is required in the reaction mixture for the synthesis of this new product suggests that histone H1 and the diadenosine compound interact during this modification reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1518460890,"The biosynthesis of type V (A,B) collagens was recently found to proceed through the sequential forms pro alpha (A,B), p alpha (A,B), and f alpha (A,B). All these chains are larger than the A,B chains extracted from tissues after pepsin digestion. This report shows that all forms contain substantial peptides which are resistant to bacterial collagenase and concludes that type V collagens differ from the intestitial collagens (types I, II, III) in retaining large noncollagenous peptides in tissues. A peptide becomes transiently attached to the processing intermediate p alpha A by a reducible linkage. The conversion of procollagen V to p-collagen V was inhibited by colchicine and arginine. Previously, the disulfide-linked heterotrimer [(pro alpha B)2 (pro alpha A)] was found and additional procollagens containing only B type molecules were inferred. Further investigations reported here agree with these conclusions and also indicate that some trimeric molecules containing more than one chain related to A may exist."

The repeat unit contains two segments consisting of variants of a basic 23-base-pair sequence that is closely related to sequences of bovine 1.706 satellite DNA. A third segment of the repeat unit contains an unrelated 611-base-pair sequence that is not internally repetitive. This segment is flanked by inverted repeats of 8 base pairs and, on one side, by a direct repeat of the terminal sequence. A related segment is present in bovine 1.711b satellite DNA and is inserted into sequences derived from the 1.715 satellite. These nucleotide sequences suggest the timing of some of the stages in the evolution of these complex, closely related satellite DNA's and indicate the mechanisms inherent in their divergence from a common ancestor."

https://openalex.org/W1975453938,"To examine the possibility that alterations in the effectiveness of electrical synapses might participate in epileptogenesis, the effects of several convulsants on an identified weak electrical synapse in Aplysia were examined. Application of pentylenetetrazole, strychnine, or tetraethylammonium led to a dramatic increase in the size of the electrical postsynaptic potential mediated by the synapse; penicillin was considerably less effective. In a number of animals, the increased electrical synaptic effectiveness led to the abnormal conduction of spikes across the synapse. If convulsants have a similar action in mammalian cortex, enhanced transmission at weak electrical synapses may provide abnormal pathways for the flow of seizure activity and contribute in part to the synchronous firing of neurons characteristic of epileptic activity."

In hypophysectomized and intact mice receiving gonadotropins (human chorionic gonadotropin), treatment with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol maintained higher plasma testosterone concentrations. Thus, this cannabinoid may interact with gonadotropin and directly influence testicular steroidogenesis in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1524547047,"The phosphorylation of rat adrenal protein components in response to adrenocorticotropin has been studied in adrenal quarters, isolated cells, and in vivo. In adrenal quarters, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of proteins was not affected by the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors despite a total inhibition of steroidogenesis. (The term dephosphorylation refers to an apparent decrease in the labeling of a particular protein with 32P at various times after the addition of ACTH. This may be due to enzymatic removal of phosphate or protein degradation or complexation of this protein with another cellular component.) Studies with isolated cell preparations identified several proteins that are phosphorylated or dephosphorylated in response to hormone. These changes in phosphorylation were also observed in adrenal quarters and correlated well with ACTH-stimulated steroidogenesis as determined by temporal analysis and dose-response studies of corticosterone production. In vivo injection of male hypophysectomized rats with [32P]phosphate and ACTH demonstrated changes in the labeling of six adrenal proteins. Many of the proteins phosphorylated in vivo were also demonstrated to be phosphorylated in both in vitro systems. Finally, the injection of a physiological dose of ACTH appeared to selectively activate the type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase within the microsomal fraction as determined by the binding of a photoaffinity-labeled reagent. These results suggest that alterations in phosphorylation of adrenal proteins in response to ACTH is proximal to or independent of the obligatory role of protein synthesis in acute steroidogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1529723244,"The early steps of excision repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are investigated. It is demonstrated that the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease associated with the Micrococcus luteus uv-specific endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester bond on the 3' side of the deoxyribose leaving a 3' hydroxy terminus and a 5' phosphoryl terminus. This nick is not a substrate for T4 polynucleotide ligase. The 3' base-free deoxyribose terminus is not a substrate for either the polymerase or the 3' to 5' exonuclease activities of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. However, the 3' terminus of the nick is converted to a substrate for DNA polymerization by the action of a 5' apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease. A three-step model for the incision step of excision repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1552256281,"Antiserum prepared from a rabbit which was immunized with human erythrocyte glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase was found to react with glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase in rabbit erythroid cells. By using this antiserum, it was proved that the specific activity of this enzyme was unchanged during the development of the rabbit erythroid cells. This leads us to conclude that the increased activity of glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase in developing erythroid cells (Narita, H., Ikura, K., Yanagawa, S., Sasaki, R., Chiba, H., Saimyoji, H., and Kumagai, N. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5230-5235) is due to the accumulation of enzyme protein. There is at least a 16-fold increase in the level of this protein during development from bone marrow erythroid cells to erythrocytes. The synthesis of glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase was shown to occur in rabbit reticulocytes and bone marrow erythroid cells. These cells were incubated for protein synthesis and the protein synthesized was precipitated with the anti-glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase antiserum and separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The immunoprecipitated product was shown to produce fragments of the same molecular weight after digestion with V8 protease as did the pure glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase. The proportion of glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase synthesis in reticulocytes (0.04% of total protein synthesis) was comparable to the level of this protein in the cells (0.07% of the total protein)."
https://openalex.org/W1484939440,"Previous studies have demonstrated that catecholamine responsiveness in a variety of cells can be altered by inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis. The neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid, NG108-CC15, which lacks catecholamine-stimulated accumulation of cyclic AMP, was investigated to determine if the responsiveness to prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) could be modified by inhibitors of protein synthesis. Cycloheximide in a time-dependent manner potentiated the ability of prostaglandin E1 to stimulate accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP. However, the alpha-adrenergic inhibition of the prostaglandin response was not affected by cycloheximide. Withdrawal of norepinephrine following a long-term incubation resulted in a potentiation of subsequent PGE1-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. Cycloheximide enhanced this norepinephrine withdrawal effect. Our previous studies have shown that cholera toxin induces refractoriness to beta-adrenergic agonists in C6-2B rat astrocytoma cells and that cycloheximide blocked this action of cholera toxin. In an analogous manner cholera toxin caused refractoriness to subsequent prostaglandin-stimulated cyclic AMP production in NG108-CC15 cells, and cycloheximide reduced cholera toxin-induced prostaglandin refractoriness. Thus cycloheximide potentiates the prostaglandin stimulatory effect, has no effect on the ability of alpha-agonists to inhibit the prostaglandin response, increases the stimulatory effect of PGE1 after norepinephrine withdrawal, and reduces cholera toxin-induced PGE1 refractoriness. these observations suggest that PGE1-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in NG108-CC15 cells contains components which are regulated by de novo protein synthesis."
