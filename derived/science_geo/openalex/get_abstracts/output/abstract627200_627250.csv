https://openalex.org/W2914458430,"There is a rich literature exploring emotional responses to engaging in artistic creative activities such as making music, writing, dancing and crafts. However, it remains unclear how such activities affect our emotions; specifically which mental processes (‘strategies’) are used to regulate our emotional responses. This paper therefore describes the design and validation of a novel instrument measuring types of emotional regulation strategies (ERSs) used when engaging in artistic creative activities: the Emotion Regulation Strategies for Artistic Creative Activities Scale (ERS-ACA). Using data from an initial pilot study (n = 740 adults, 80.4% female, median age 25–34) and a follow-up large internet sample (n = 47,924, 56.7% female, average age 47.3 ± 14.6 years), we followed a theory-driven iterative factor analysis process. Our analyses converged on a final 18-item scale comprising an overall ‘general’ factor of ERSs alongside three subscales: a 7-item factor comprising ‘avoidance strategies’ (such as distraction, suppression and detachment), a 6-item factor comprising ‘approach strategies’ (such as acceptance, reappraisal and problem solving), and a 5-item factor comprising ‘self-development strategies’ (such as enhanced self-identify, improved self-esteem and increased agency). All factors showed strong internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha: General Factor = 0.93, Factor 1 = 0.9, Factor 2 = 0.88, Factor 3 = 0.88). We confirmed strong convergent and divergent validity, construct validity, consistency of internal reliability and test-retest reliability of the scale in a third study (n = 165, 82.2% female, average age 46.3 ± 12.2 years). In conclusion, artistic creative activities appear to affect our emotions via a number of ERSs that can be broadly classified into three categories: avoidance, approach and self-development. The ERS-ACA scale presented and validated here should support further research into the use of ERSs when engaging in artistic creative activities and enhance our understanding about how these activities affect mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2912878510,"Amid growing rates of burnout, physicians report increasing electronic health record (EHR) usage alongside decreasing clinical facetime with patients. There exists a pressing need to improve physician-computer-patient interactions by streamlining EHR workflow. To identify interventions to improve EHR design and usage, we systematically characterize EHR activity among internal medicine residents at a tertiary academic hospital across various inpatient rotations and roles from June 2013 to November 2016. Logged EHR timestamps were extracted from Stanford Hospital’s EHR system (Epic) and cross-referenced against resident rotation schedules. We tracked the quantity of EHR logs across 24-hour cycles to reveal daily usage patterns. In addition, we decomposed daily EHR time into time spent on specific EHR actions (e.g. chart review, note entry and review, results review).In examining 24-hour usage cycles from general medicine day and night team rotations, we identified a prominent trend in which night team activity promptly ceased at the shift’s end, while day team activity tended to linger post-shift. Across all rotations and roles, residents spent on average 5.38 hours (standard deviation = 2.07) using the EHR. PGY1 (post-graduate year one) interns and PGY2+ residents spent on average 2.4 and 4.1 times the number of EHR hours on information review (chart, note, and results review) as information entry (note and order entry).Analysis of EHR event log data can enable medical educators and programs to develop more targeted interventions to improve physician-computer-patient interactions, centered on specific EHR actions."

Ligand recognition through large extracellular domains leads to the reorganization of transmembrane regions to activate G protein signaling. Although structures of individual domains are known, the complete architecture of a class C GPCR and the mechanism of interdomain coupling during receptor activation are unclear. By screening a mutagenesis library of the human class C sweet taste receptor subunit T1R2, we enhanced surface expression and identified a dibasic intracellular retention motif that modulates surface expression and co-trafficking with its heterodimeric partner T1R3. Using a highly expressed T1R2 variant, dimerization sites along the entire subunit within all the structural domains were identified by a comprehensive mutational scan for co-trafficking with T1R3 in human cells. The data further reveal that the C terminus of the extracellular cysteine-rich domain needs to be properly folded for T1R3 dimerization and co-trafficking, but not for surface expression of T1R2 alone. These results guided the modeling of the T1R2–T1R3 dimer in living cells, which predicts a twisted arrangement of domains around the central axis, and a continuous folded structure between transmembrane domain loops and the cysteine-rich domains. These insights have implications for how conformational changes between domains are coupled within class C GPCRs.

T1R2 and T1R3 belong to the class C G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This family is dominated by important neuronal receptors, including eight types of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) and the γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR) that recognize the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, respectively, and the umami taste receptor (T1R1–T1R3). Other class C GPCRs include the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) for regulating calcium homeostasis and the promiscuous androgen receptor GPRC6A. Class C GPCRs have a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) genetically fused to the seven-helix transmembrane domain (TMD). The ECD is further divided into a ligand-binding domain (LBD), which adopts a bi-lobed structure that closes over a ligand similar to the action of a venus-fly trap, and, with the exception of GABABR, a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that connects to the TMD (7Chun L.

It is unclear whether the dimeric mGluR1 TMD structure is physiological or perhaps represents an alternative conformational state. Although these studies provide insights into receptor dimerization and ligand-induced conformational change, it remains unclear how LBD closure generates conformational changes in the TMD. This limitation is a consequence of not knowing how individual domains are assembled into a full-length receptor. Understanding how T1R2 and T1R3 associate can therefore illuminate the mechanism of class C GPCRs generally. In this study, we identify a conserved surface during in vitro selection of human T1R2 for associating with T1R3. Identifying the dimerization surface of the sweet taste receptor was challenging due to low surface expression (2Li X. Staszewski L. Xu H. Durick K. Zoller M. Adler E. Human receptors for sweet and umami taste.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99 (11917125): 4692-469610.1073/pnas.072090199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 38Ashikawa Y. Ihara M.

A subsequent deep mutational scan of T1R2 in human cells identified surfaces on lobe 1 of the LBD, on the CRD, and in TM6 for dimerization with T1R3 as assessed by their co-trafficking to the plasma membrane. These surfaces are also conserved in natural evolution, but whereas natural sequence conservation is shaped by multiple properties such as protein stability, ligand binding, and signaling, the deep mutational scan could be focused on T1R2–T1R3 co-trafficking to identify residues under explicit conservation for dimerization. We consequently propose a model of the T1R2–T1R3 heterodimer consistent with the saturation mutagenesis and previously published studies. Surface localization of human T1R3 depends on human T1R2 co-expression, suggesting the two subunits must form a heterodimeric complex for appropriate trafficking of a functional sweet taste receptor (39Shimizu M. Goto M. Kawai T. Yamashita A. Kusakabe Y. Distinct human and mouse membrane trafficking systems for sweet taste receptors T1r2 and T1r3.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 (25029362)e10042510.1371/journal.pone.0100425Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We focus on the mutagenesis and selection of T1R2 to tease apart the effects of mutations on subunit stability (based on the independent trafficking of T1R2 to the cell surface) and dimerization (based on T1R2–T1R3 co-trafficking). T1R2 and T1R3 were expressed with extracellular N-terminal tags for surface detection either independently or together in Expi293F cells, a suspension culture derivative of HEK293 that has advantages for sorting large mutant libraries. Based on flow cytometry of cells stained in nonpermeable and permeable conditions (Fig. 1, A–D), we found low levels of T1R2 and barely detectable levels of T1R3 on the cell surface, with most protein remaining intracellular. T1R3 surface expression was substantially increased by co-expression with T1R2 but not with the unrelated GPCR CXCR4 (Fig. 1, B and D, and Fig. S1). T1R2 surface levels, however, were decreased by co-expression with T1R3, due partially to decreased total expression (Fig. 1, A and C). Using a brighter fluorescent antibody showed that although T1R2 surface expression is reduced, some T1R2 nonetheless remains surface-localized when co-expressed with T1R3 (Fig. S1). To identify T1R2 mutants with enhanced surface expression that may be more amenable to biochemical studies, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to select high-expressing T1R2 variants. A random mutagenesis library of FLAG-tagged T1R2 was transfected into Expi293F cells using conditions that typically yield no more than one sequence variant per cell, providing a tight link between genotype and phenotype (40Heredia J.D. Park J. Brubaker R.J. Szymanski S.K. Gill K.S. Procko E. Mapping interaction sites on human chemokine receptors by deep mutational scanning.J. Immunol. 2018; 200 (29678950): 3825-383910.4049/jimmunol.1800343Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The highest T1R2-expressing cells were enriched by two rounds of FACS (Fig. 1E). 61 individual clones were isolated and tested, and the 18 clones with higher T1R2 surface expression were sequenced. All were unique, and yet despite the lack of convergence, two kinds of mutations were over-represented; seven clones had a serine to asparagine substitution at position 212, and 10 clones had frameshift mutations that result in extended C termini or premature termination after TM1 (Fig. 1F and Fig. S2). We named clones with only missense mutations as M1 to M7 and clones with frameshift mutations as FS1 to FS10. An 18th mutant combined premature termination after TM3 with 9 amino acid substitutions, but because it lacked similarities to other clones, it was excluded from further analysis. In summary, a diverse library of T1R2 was successfully evolved in vitro for higher surface expression. T1R2 variants with enhanced surface expression had one or more missense mutations in the extracellular domain, with the exception of clone FS1 that only had a frameshift (Fig. 1F and Fig. S2). To determine which of the missense mutations are responsible for higher surface expression, we used targeted mutagenesis to introduce the mutations individually into T1R2. Most enhanced T1R2 surface expression, with small increases in total expression compared with WT (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3A). Mutation S212N, which was found in seven of the clones, had the largest effect. I132S, R230H, and D231G also caused substantial increases in surface expression, whereas other mutations had lesser effects. With few exceptions, mutations could generally be combined for even higher T1R2 surface expression (Fig. 2A). Co-expression with T1R3 decreased surface T1R2 by half or more for all the missense mutations (Fig. 2A), due in part to decreased total expression (Fig. S3A). Surprisingly, T1R3 surface expression was only improved by co-expression with a subset of the T1R2 variants containing mutations I132S, S212N, R230H, D231G, or Q265R, whereas other highly-expressed T1R2 mutants failed to bring T1R3 to the cell surface as effectively as WT and are presumably defective for dimeric associations (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3B). The five most effective T1R2 mutations–I132S, S212N, R230H, D231G, and Q265R–are located close to the T1R3-binding interface and are directed toward the solvent (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3C). I132S and S212N generate consensus glycosylation sequences (Asn130–Tyr131–Ser132 and Asn212–Asp213–Thr214). N-Linked glycosylation is often involved in folding and trafficking of membrane proteins (41Vagin O. Kraut J.A. Sachs G. Role of N-glycosylation in trafficking of apical membrane proteins in epithelia.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 296 (18971212): F459-F46910.1152/ajprenal.90340.2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Whether glycosylation on residue 212 might interfere with ECD dimerization would depend on the relative orientations of T1R2–T1R3 lobes 1 and 2 (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3C), perhaps explaining why S212N caused a large increase in T1R2 surface expression but a smaller increase for T1R3 compared with other mutations (Fig. 2, A and B). R230H and D231G, which can cap and break the C terminus of the second helix in lobe 2, may facilitate folding of the loop that forms a critical disulfide (Cys233–Cys513) between the LBD and CRD (Fig. S3D). Finally, Q265R makes favorable contacts to nearby backbone atoms (Fig. S3E). Ten of the T1R2 clones had frameshifts generating premature termination after TM1 or an extended C terminus of altered sequence after TM7 (Fig. 1F and Fig. S2). We therefore hypothesized that a C-terminal motif in the transmembrane domain or cytosolic tail of T1R2 inhibits surface expression. To test this, we characterized truncated variants of T1R2 and T1R3 in which the extracellular domains alone (R2ECD and R3ECD, respectively) were fused to a canonical transmembrane helix from MHC class I (R2ECD–MHC and R3ECD–MHC) (Fig. 3A). Surface expression of both R2ECD–MHC and R3ECD–MHC was indeed improved, whereas total expression was similar to the WT proteins (Fig. 3, B and C, and Fig. S4, A and B). We further tested two T1R2 frameshift mutants with extended (R2FS1) or pre-matured (R2FS10) cytosolic tails. Surface expression of R2FS1 and R2FS10 was substantially increased, yet these T1R2 variants had relatively similar total expression (Fig. 3B and Fig. S4A). Cells expressing R2FS1 responded to sweet compounds similarly to cells expressing T1R2, indicating that the mutant is functional (Fig. 3, D–F). The T1R2 transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail therefore retain T1R2 intracellularly, and the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of T1R3 couples T1R3 escape from intracellular compartments to the presence of T1R2. T1R2 and T1R3 variants were then co-expressed to determine whether ECD interactions are sufficient to promote T1R3 surface trafficking. Indeed, surface localization of WT T1R3 or R3ECD–MHC was enhanced by co-expression with R2FS10 and R2ECD–MHC, as well as by co-expression with soluble R2ECD that lacks any transmembrane anchor (Fig. 3, G and H). Soluble R3ECD was also expressed on the cell surface with T1R2 variants (Fig. 3I), presumably bound to the T1R2 ECD. Total expression of all variants was similar to the WT proteins (Fig. S4, C–E). ECD interactions are therefore sufficient for promoting T1R2–T1R3 surface expression. Surface expression of R3ECD–MHC and R3ECD was correlated with surface levels of the various T1R2 variants, but surface localization of full-length T1R3 was not. Instead, T1R3 levels at the plasma membrane remained similar or were lower when co-expressed with the T1R2 variants R2FS1 or R2FS10 or the extracellular domains R2ECD or R2ECD–MHC. This was despite these different T1R2 constructs expressing on the cell surface at much higher levels than WT T1R2, whereas total expression was similar (Fig. 3G and Fig. S4C). The transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of T1R2 is therefore required for optimum surface expression of a T1R2–T1R3 heterodimer. Compared with WT T1R2, the R2FS1 variant has increased surface expression and differs by a short random extension three residues in from the native C terminus (Fig. 3, B and J). Because the cytosolic tail of T1R2 is also highly conserved (Fig. 3J), we hypothesized that the cytosolic tail regulates trafficking. To narrow down the location of a trafficking motif, we truncated the last five residues (R2Δ835–839), as well as substituted the highly conserved terminal basic residues at positions 837 and 838 to glycine (R2-RR837–8GG), as found in R2FS1. Surface T1R2 expression was increased by both modifications, whereas total expression was similar to WT T1R2 (Fig. 3K). However, surface T1R3 failed to increase beyond levels achieved by co-expression with WT T1R2, similar to the previously characterized R2FS1 construct (Fig. S4, F and G). T1R1, a homolog of T1R2 that also forms a heterodimer with T1R3 for the recognition of umami taste, similarly has two basic residues at its C terminus, but their substitution did not increase T1R1 surface"

We assess the association of health insurance (HI) schemes in general, and RSBY (National Health Insurance Scheme) in particular, on extent and pattern of healthcare utilization. Secondly, we assess the relationship of HI and RSBY on out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures and financial risk protection (FRP). Methods A cross-sectional study was undertaken to interview 62335 individuals among 12,134 households in 8 districts of three states in India i.e. Gujarat, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (UP). Data on socio-demographic characteristics, assets, education, occupation, consumption expenditure, illness in last 15 days or hospitalization during last 365 days, treatment sought and its OOP expenditure was collected. We computed catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) as indicator for FRP. Hospitalization rate, choice of care provider and CHE were regressed to assess their association with insurance status and type of insurance scheme, after adjusting for other covariates. Results Mean OOP expenditures for outpatient care among insured and uninsured were INR 961 (USD 16) and INR 840 (USD 14); and INR 32573 (USD 543) and INR 24788 (USD 413) for an episode of hospitalization respectively. The prevalence of CHE for hospitalization was 28% and 26% among the insured and uninsured population respectively. No significant association was observed in multivariate analysis between hospitalization rate, choice of care provider or CHE with insurance status or RSBY in particular. Conclusion Health insurance in its present form does not seem to provide requisite improvement in access to care or financial risk protection."

Although cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 9 has an established pathogenic role in various cancers, its function in ovarian cancer remains poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of CDK9 and its therapeutic potential in ovarian cancer. CDK9 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in a unique ovarian cancer tissue microarray constructed with paired primary, metastatic, and recurrent tumor tissues from 26 ovarian cancer patients. CDK9 was highly expressed in human ovarian cancer cell lines and was also elevated in metastatic and recurrent ovarian tumor tissue compared with patient-matched primary ovarian tumor tissue. In addition, increased CDK9 significantly correlated with poor patient prognosis. Inhibition of CDK9 by small interfering RNA or CDK9 inhibitor functionally suppressed RNA transcription elongation, induced apoptosis, and reduced proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Inhibition of CDK9 also suppressed ovarian cancer cell spheroid growth, clonogenicity formation, and migration activity. Our results reveal CDK9 as a novel prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for preventing metastasis and recurrence while also improving the overall clinical outcome for ovarian cancer patients.-Wang, J., Dean, D.

https://openalex.org/W2912951370,"Human personality may substantially affect the nature of care provided to dependants. This link has been well researched in parents and children, however, relatively little is known about this dynamic with regards to humans' relationships with non-human animals. Owner interactions with companion animals may provide valuable insight into the wider phenomenon of familial interactions, as owners usually adopt the role of primary caregiver and potentially surrogate parent. This study, using cats as an exemplar, explored the relationship between owner personality and the lifestyles to which cats are exposed. In addition, it explored owner personality as it related to reported cat behaviour and wellbeing. Cat owners (n = 3331) responded to an online survey examining their personality and the health, behaviour and management of their cats. Owner personality was measured using the Big Five Inventory (BFI) to assess: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Neuroticism and Openness. Owners also provided information concerning the physical health, breed type, management and behavioural styles of their cats. Generalised linear mixed models were used to identify relationships between owner personality and a range of factors that may have welfare implications for the wider companion animal population, and specifically, cats. Higher owner Neuroticism was associated with an increased likelihood of non-pedigree rather than pedigree cat ownership, a decreased likelihood of ad libitum access to the outdoors, cats being reported as having a 'behavioural problem', displaying more aggressive and anxious/fearful behavioural styles and more stress-related sickness behaviours, as well as having an ongoing medical condition and being overweight. Other owner personality traits were generally found to correlate more positively with various lifestyle, behaviour and welfare parameters. For example, higher owner Extroversion was associated with an increased likelihood that the cat would be provided ad libitum access to the outdoors; higher owner Agreeableness was associated with a higher level of owner reported satisfaction with their cat, and with a greater likelihood of owners reporting their cats as being of a normal weight. Finally higher owner Conscientiousness was associated with the cat displaying less anxious/fearful, aggressive, aloof/avoidant, but more gregarious behavioural styles. These findings demonstrate that the relationship between carer personality and the care received by a dependent, may extend beyond the human family to animal-owner relationships, with significant implications for the choice of management, behaviour and potentially the broader wellbeing of companion animals."

We used a cross-sectional research design to study perceived racial microaggressions, discrimination, and mental health in 296 African American and Latino respondents. Participants completed measures that assess healthcare microaggressions and daily discrimination as well as the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results revealed that the MHCS has promising psychometric properties. The confirmatory factory analysis (CFA) revealed that the MHCS is a unidimensional scale. Multi-group CFAs provided evidence of measurement invariance across racial / ethnic groups and gender. The internal consistency reliability of the scale was .88 for the overall sample. Microaggressions correlated with daily discrimination scores (r = .67), as well as mental health symptoms (r's = .40 -.52). The MHCS is a brief, valid, and reliable measure that can be used to assess and monitor racial and cultural forces that shape patient-provider interactions. This study concludes with a discussion of the ongoing need for research on microaggressions in healthcare as well as implications for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2951110650,"Besides intrinsic changes, malignant cells also release soluble signals that reshape their microenvironment. Among these signals is WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1), a secreted matricellular protein whose expression is elevated in several cancers, including melanoma, and is associated with reduced survival of patients diagnosed with primary melanoma. Here, we found that WISP1 knockout increases cell proliferation and represses wound healing, migration, and invasion of mouse and human melanoma cells in multiple in vitro assays. Metastasis assays revealed that WISP1 knockout represses tumor metastasis of B16F10 and YUMM1.7 melanoma cells in both C57BL/6Ncrl and NOD-scid IL2Rγnull (NSG) mice. WT B16F10 cells having an invasion phenotype in a transwell assay possessed a gene expression signature similar to that observed in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), including E-cadherin repression and fibronectin and N-cadherin induction. Upon WISP1 knockout, expression of these EMT signature genes went in the opposite direction in both mouse and human cell lines, and EMT-associated gene expression was restored upon exposure to media containing WISP1 or to recombinant WISP1 protein. In vivo, Wisp1 knockout–associated metastasis repression was reversed by the reintroduction of either WISP1 or snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAI1). Experiments testing EMT gene activation and inhibition with recombinant WISP1 or kinase inhibitors in B16F10 and YUMM1.7 cells suggested that WISP1 activates AKT Ser/Thr kinase and that MEK/ERK signaling pathways shift melanoma cells from proliferation to invasion.

Tumor metastasis is a multistep cascade that starts with local invasion into the surrounding tissue and culminates in colonizing distant tissues (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A.

Classically, melanoma is thought to progress linearly, whereby the growth of the primary tumor progressively increases the propensity for metastasis (3Clark Jr., W.H. Elder D.E. Guerry 4th, D.

However, 4–12% of patients with metastatic melanoma do not have a clinically identifiable primary tumor, and the excised primary melanoma can still recur at different sites in the body as metastatic lesions (4Damsky W.E.

https://openalex.org/W2912111785,"Fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (Fndc5) is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in the skeletal muscle. It was reported that exercise promotes the shedding of the extracellular domain of Fndc5, generating a circulating peptide (irisin) that cross-talks to adipose tissues to convert lipid-storing white adipocytes to energy-catabolizing beige adipocytes. However, the requirement of Fndc5 in mediating the beneficial effect of exercise remains to be determined. Here, we created a mouse model of Fndc5 mutation through transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated DNA targeting. The Fndc5 mutant mice have normal skeletal muscle development, growth, regeneration, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism at resting state, even when fed a high-fat diet. In response to running exercise, however, the Fndc5 mutant mice exhibit reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and have lower maximal oxygen consumption compared with the exercised wild-type mice. Mechanistically, Fndc5 mutation attenuates exercise-induced browning of white adipose tissue that is crucial for the metabolic benefits of physical activities. These data provide genetic evidence that Fndc5 is dispensable for muscle development and basal metabolism but essential for exercise-induced browning of white adipose tissues in mice.-Xiong, Y., Wu, Z., Zhang, B., Wang, C., Mao, F., Liu, X., Hu, K., Sun, X., Jin, W., Kuang, S.

https://openalex.org/W2912117968,"High prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B has been reported among pregnant women in Ghana. In endemic areas, the diagnoses of malaria and hepatitis B among pregnant women on antenatal visits are done using histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), respectively, which are, however, reported to give some false positive results. Also, socio-economic determinants have been drawn from these RDTs results which may have questionable implications. Thus, this study was aimed at evaluating the prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B by comparing RDTs with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) outcomes, and relating the PCR prevalence with socio-economic status among pregnant women in Northern Ghana.We screened 2071 pregnant women on their first antenatal visit for Plasmodium falciparum and hepatitis B virus (HBV) using HRP2 and HBsAg RDTs, and confirming the infections with PCR. Socio-economic and obstetric information were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire, and associations with the infections were determined using Pearson's chi-square and multinomial logistic regression analyses at a significance level of p<0.05.The prevalence of the infections by RDTs/PCR was: 14.1%/13.4% for P. falciparum mono-infection, 7.9%/7.5% for HBV mono-infection, and 1.9%/1.7% for P. falciparum/HBV co-infection. No statistical difference in prevalence rates were observed between the RDTs and PCRs (χ2 = 0.119, p = 0.73 for malaria and χ2 = 0.139, p = 0.709 for hepatitis B). Compared with PCRs, the sensitivity/specificity of the RDTs was 97.5%/99.1% and 97.9%/99.4% for HRP2 and HBsAg respectively. Socio-economic status was observed not to influence HBV mono-infection among the pregnant women (educational status: AOR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.52-1.16, p = 0.222; economic status: AOR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.72-1.56, p = 0.739; financial status: AOR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.44-1.00, p = 0.052). However, pregnant women with formal education were at a lower risk for P. falciparum mono-infection (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.32-0.71, p<0.001) and P. falciparum/HBV co-infection (AOR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.11-0.67, p = 0.005). Also those with good financial status were also at a lower risk for P. falciparum mono-infection (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.36-0.74, p<0.001).Our data has shown that, the RDTs are comparable to PCR and can give a representative picture of the prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B in endemic countries. Also, our results support the facts that improving socio-economic status is paramount in eliminating malaria in endemic settings. However, socio-economic status did not influence the prevalence of HBV mono-infection among pregnant women in Northern Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W2913109648,"TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), a glycolytic inhibitor, plays vital roles in regulating cellular metabolism and oxidative stress. However, the role of highly expressed TIGAR in skeletal muscle remains unexplored. In the present study, TIGAR levels varied in different skeletal muscles and fibers. An exhaustive swimming test with a load corresponding to 5% of body weight was utilized in mice to assess the effects of TIGAR on exercise-induced fatigue and muscle damage. The running time and metabolic indicators were significantly greater in wild-type (WT) mice compared with TIGAR knockout (KO) mice. Poor exercise capacity was accompanied by decreased type IIA fibers in TIGAR KO mice. Decreased mitochondrial number and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were observed more in TIGAR KO mice than in WT mice, which were involved in sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-mediated deacetylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α), and resveratrol treatment in TIGAR KO mice can increase mitochondrial content and exercise time. Much more TIGAR was also detected in mitochondria during exhaustive exercise. In addition, TIGAR, rather than mitochondria-targeted TIGAR achieved by in vitro plasmid transfection, promoted SIRT1-PGC1α pathway. Glutathione S-transferase-TIGAR pull-down assay followed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry found that TIGAR interacted with ATP synthase F1 subunit α (ATP5A1), and its binding to ATP5A1 increased during exhaustive exercise. Overexpression of mitochondrial-TIGAR enhanced ATP generation, maintained mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress under hypoxia condition. Taken together, our results uncovered a novel role for TIGAR in mitochondrial regulation in fast-twitch oxidative skeletal muscle through SIRT1-PGC1α and translocation into mitochondria, which contribute to the increase in exercise endurance of mice.-Geng, J., Wei, M., Yuan, X., Liu, Z., Wang, X., Zhang, D., Luo, L., Wu, J., Guo, W., Qin, Z.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2913633416,"Wild relatives of wheat, such as Aegilops spp. are potential sources of genes conferring tolerance to drought stress. As drought stress affects seed composition, the main goal of the present study was to determine the effects of drought stress on the content and composition of the grain storage protein (gliadin (Gli), glutenin (Glu), unextractable polymeric proteins (UPP%) and dietary fiber (arabinoxylan, β-glucan) components of hexaploid bread wheat (T. aestivum) lines containing added chromosomes from Ae. biuncialis or Ae. geniculata. Both Aegilops parents have higher contents of protein and β-glucan and higher proportions of water-soluble arabinoxylans (determined as pentosans) than wheat when grown under both well-watered and drought stress conditions. In general, drought stress resulted in increased contents of protein and total pentosans in the addition lines, while the β-glucan content decreased in many of the addition lines. The differences found between the wheat/Aegilops addition lines and wheat parents under well-watered conditions were also manifested under drought stress conditions: Namely, elevated β-glucan content was found in addition lines containing chromosomes 5Ug, 7Ug and 7Mb, while chromosomes 1Ub and 1Mg affected the proportion of polymeric proteins (determined as Glu/Gli and UPP%, respectively) under both well-watered and drought stress conditions. Furthermore, the addition of chromosome 6Mg decreased the WE-pentosan content under both conditions. The grain composition of the Aegilops accessions was more stable under drought stress than that of wheat, and wheat lines with the added Aegilops chromosomes 2Mg and 5Mg also had more stable grain protein and pentosan contents. The negative effects of drought stress on both the physical and compositional properties of wheat were also reduced by the addition of these. These results suggest that the stability of the grain composition could be improved under drought stress conditions by the intraspecific hybridization of wheat with its wild relatives."
https://openalex.org/W2911920471,"Purpose To investigate the role of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a potential imaging biomarker to predict metastasis (lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis) in colon cancer based on the ADC-value of the primary tumor. Methods Thirty patients (21M, 9F) were included retrospectively. All patients received a 1.5T MRI of the colon including T2 and DWI sequences. ADC maps were calculated for each patient. An expert reader manually delineated all colon tumors to measure mean ADC and histogram metrics (mean, min, max, median, standard deviation (SD), skewness, kurtosis, 5th-95th percentiles) were calculated. Advanced colon cancer was defined as lymph node mestastasis (N+) or distant metastasis (M+). The student Mann Whitney U-test was used to assess the differences between the ADC means of early and advanced colon cancer. To compare the accuracy of lymph node metastasis (N+) prediction based on morpholigical criteria versus ADC-value of the primary tumor, two blinded readers, determined the lymph node metastasis (N0 vs N+) based on morphological criteria. The sensitivity and specificity in predicting lymph node metastasis was calculated for both readers and for the ADC-value of the primary tumor, with histopathology results as the gold standard. Results There was a significant difference between the mean ADC-value of advanced versus early tumors (p = 0.002). The optimal cut off value was 1179 * 10−3 mm2/s with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 and a sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 86% respectively to predict advanced tumors. Histogram analyses did not add any significant additional value. The sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of lymph node metastasis based on morphological criteria were 40% and 63% for reader 1 and 30% and 88% for reader 2 respectively. The primary tumor ADC-value using 1.179 * 10−3 mm2/s as threshold had a 100% sensitivity and specificity in predicting lymph node metastasis. Conclusion The ADC-value of the primary tumor has the potential to predict advanced colon cancer, defined as lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis, with lower ADC values significantly associated with advanced tumors. Furthermore the ADC-value of the primary tumor increases the prediction accuracy of lymph node metastasis compared with morphological criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2952654207,"Maize originated as a tropical plant that required short days to transition from vegetative to reproductive development. ZmCCT10 [CO, CONSTANS, CO-LIKE and TIMING OF CAB1 (CCT) transcription factor family] is a regulator of photoperiod response and was identified as a major QTL controlling photoperiod sensitivity in maize. We modulated expression of ZmCCT10 in transgenic maize using two constitutive promoters with different expression levels. Transgenic plants over expressing ZmCCT10 with either promoter were delayed in their transition from vegetative to reproductive development but were not affected in their switch from juvenile-to-adult vegetative growth. Strikingly, transgenic plants containing the stronger expressing construct had a prolonged period of vegetative growth accompanied with dramatic modifications to plant architecture that impacted both vegetative and reproductive traits. These plants did not produce ears, but tassels were heavily branched. In more than half of the transgenic plants, tassels were converted into a branched leafy structure resembling phyllody, often composed of vegetative plantlets. Analysis of expression modules controlling the floral transition and meristem identity linked these networks to photoperiod dependent regulation, whereas phase change modules appeared to be photoperiod independent. Results from this study clarified the influence of the photoperiod pathway on vegetative and reproductive development and allowed for the fine-tuning of the maize flowering time model."
https://openalex.org/W2913493797,"Sarcopenic obesity, the combination of skeletal muscle mass and function loss with an increase in body fat, is associated with physical limitations, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic stress, and increased risk of mortality. Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) plays a critical role in the regulation of whole-body energy metabolism because of its involvement in controlling appetite, fuel distribution, and utilization. Inhibition of CB1R improves insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in pancreatic β-cells and hepatocytes. We have now developed a skeletal muscle-specific CB1R-knockout (Skm-CB1R-/-) mouse to study the specific role of CB1R in muscle. Muscle-CB1R ablation prevented diet-induced and age-induced insulin resistance by increasing IR signaling. Moreover, muscle-CB1R ablation enhanced AKT signaling, reducing myostatin expression and increasing IL-6 secretion. Subsequently, muscle-CB1R ablation increased myogenesis through its action on MAPK-mediated myogenic gene expression. Consequently, Skm-CB1R-/- mice had increased muscle mass and whole-body lean/fat ratio in obesity and aging. Muscle-CB1R ablation improved mitochondrial performance, leading to increased whole-body muscle energy expenditure and improved physical endurance, with no change in body weight. These results collectively show that CB1R in muscle is sufficient to regulate whole-body metabolism and physical performance and is a novel target for the treatment of sarcopenic obesity. -González-Mariscal, I., Montoro, R.

https://openalex.org/W2912044184,"Exposure to spaceflight and microgravity causes physiologic and psychologic changes including bone loss, cardiovascular dysfunction, and immune dysfunction. Anemia and hematopoietic disorders are observed in astronauts after spaceflight. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which can self-renew and give rise to all blood cells, play vital roles in hematopoiesis and homeostasis; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the impacts of microgravity on the proliferation of HSPCs remain unclear. We maintained mouse bone marrow HSPCs in the presence of stem cell factor for 12 d under spaceflight and simulated microgravity conditions, respectively, and analyzed cell proliferation and gene expression. Both spaceflight and simulated microgravity significantly decreased the number of HSPCs, mainly by blocking cell cycle at G1/S transition, but did not affect their differentiation abilities. RNA-sequencing data indicated that genes related to cell proliferation were down-regulated, whereas the genes related to cell death were up-regulated under microgravity. Among the gene signatures, we identified that the Kit-Ras/cAMP-cAMP response element-binding protein pathway might be one of the major microgravity-regulated pathways during HSPC proliferation. Furthermore, the quantification of notable genes was validated at the mRNA levels under simulated microgravity condition. Overall, these results would help us to understand the intracellular molecular mechanisms regulating microgravity-inhibited proliferation of HSPCs.-Wang, P., Tian, H., Zhang, J., Qian, J., Li, L., Shi, L., Zhao, Y. Spaceflight/microgravity inhibits the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells by decreasing Kit-Ras/cAMP-CREB pathway networks as evidenced by RNA-Seq assays."
https://openalex.org/W2898656266,"Facial expressions are fundamental to interpersonal communication, including social interaction, and allow people of different ages, cultures, and languages to quickly and reliably convey emotional information. Historically, facial expression research has followed from discrete emotion theories, which posit a limited number of distinct affective states that are represented with specific patterns of facial action. Much less work has focused on dimensional features of emotion, particularly positive and negative affect intensity. This is likely, in part, because achieving inter-rater reliability for facial action and affect intensity ratings is painstaking and labor-intensive. We use computer-vision and machine learning (CVML) to identify patterns of facial actions in 4,648 video recordings of 125 human participants, which show strong correspondences to positive and negative affect intensity ratings obtained from highly trained coders. Our results show that CVML can both (1) determine the importance of different facial actions that human coders use to derive positive and negative affective ratings when combined with interpretable machine learning methods, and (2) efficiently automate positive and negative affect intensity coding on large facial expression databases. Further, we show that CVML can be applied to individual human judges to infer which facial actions they use to generate perceptual emotion ratings from facial expressions."
https://openalex.org/W2949514337,"The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is an essential and highly abundant central node in the interactome of eukaryotic cells. Many of its large number of client proteins are relevant to cancer. A hallmark of Hsp90-dependent proteins is that their accumulation is compromised by Hsp90 inhibitors. Combined with the anecdotal observation that cancer cells may be more sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors, this has led to clinical trials aiming to develop Hsp90 inhibitors as anti-cancer agents. However, the sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors has not been studied in rigorously matched normal versus cancer cells, and despite the discovery of important regulators of Hsp90 activity and inhibitor sensitivity, it has remained unclear, why cancer cells might be more sensitive. To revisit this issue more systematically, we have generated an isogenic pair of normal and oncogenically transformed NIH-3T3 cell lines. Our proteomic analysis of the impact of three chemically different Hsp90 inhibitors shows that these affect a substantial portion of the oncogenic program and that indeed, transformed cells are hypersensitive. Targeting the oncogenic signaling pathway reverses the hypersensitivity, and so do inhibitors of DNA replication, cell growth, translation and energy metabolism. Conversely, stimulating normal cells with growth factors or challenging their proteostasis by overexpressing an aggregation-prone sensitizes them to Hsp90 inhibitors. Thus, the differential sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors may not stem from any particular intrinsic difference between normal and cancer cells, but rather from a shift in the balance between cellular quiescence and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2914291647,"Globally, pangolins are threatened by poaching and illegal trade. Taiwan presents a contrary situation, where the wild pangolin population has stabilized and even begun to increase in the last two decades. This paper illustrates the factors responsible for causing mortality and morbidity in the wild Taiwanese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla pentadactyla) based on radio-tracking data of wild pangolins and records of sick or injured pangolins admitted to a Taiwanese wildlife rehabilitation center. Despite being proficient burrowers, results from radio-tracking show that Taiwanese pangolins are highly susceptible to getting trapped in tree hollows or ground burrows. Data from Pingtung Rescue Center for Endangered Wild Animals showed that trauma (73.0%) was the major reason for morbidity in the Taiwanese pangolin with trauma from gin traps being the leading cause (77.8%), especially during the dry season, followed by tail injuries caused by dog attacks (20.4%). Despite these threats, Taiwan has had substantial success in rehabilitating and releasing injured pangolins, primarily due to the close collaboration of Taiwanese wildlife rehabilitation centers over the last twenty years."
https://openalex.org/W2913128469,"Atypical myopathy (AM) in horses is caused by ingestion of seeds of the Acer species (Sapindaceae family). Methylenecyclopropylacetyl-CoA (MCPA-CoA), derived from hypoglycin A (HGA), is currently the only active toxin in Acer pseudoplatanus or Acer negundo seeds related to AM outbreaks. However, seeds or arils of various Sapindaceae (e.g., ackee, lychee, mamoncillo, longan fruit) also contain methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), which is a structural analogue of HGA that can cause hypoglycaemic encephalopathy in humans. The active poison formed from MCPG is methylenecyclopropylformyl-CoA (MCPF-CoA). MCPF-CoA and MCPA-CoA strongly inhibit enzymes that participate in β-oxidation and energy production from fat. The aim of our study was to investigate if MCPG is involved in Acer seed poisoning in horses. MCPG, as well as glycine and carnitine conjugates (MCPF-glycine, MCPF-carnitine), were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of serum and urine from horses that had ingested Acer pseudoplatanus seeds and developed typical AM symptoms. The results were compared to those of healthy control horses. For comparison, HGA and its glycine and carnitine derivatives were also measured. Additionally, to assess the degree of enzyme inhibition of β-oxidation, several acyl glycines and acyl carnitines were included in the analysis. In addition to HGA and the specific toxic metabolites (MCPA-carnitine and MCPA-glycine), MCPG, MCPF-glycine and MCPF-carnitine were detected in the serum and urine of affected horses. Strong inhibition of β-oxidation was demonstrated by elevated concentrations of all acyl glycines and carnitines, but the highest correlations were observed between MCPF-carnitine and isobutyryl-carnitine (r = 0.93) as well as between MCPA- (and MCPF-) glycine and valeryl-glycine with r = 0.96 (and r = 0.87). As shown here, for biochemical analysis of atypical myopathy of horses, it is necessary to take MCPG and the corresponding metabolites into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2914601957,"Cerrena unicolor is a wood-degrading basidiomycete with ecological and biotechnological importance. Comprehensive Biolog-based analysis was performed to assess the metabolic capabilities and sensitivity to chemicals of C. unicolor FCL139 growing in various sawdust substrates and light conditions. The metabolic preferences of the fungus towards utilization of specific substrates were shown to be correlated with the sawdust medium applied for fungus growth and the light conditions. The highest catabolic activity of C. unicolor was observed after fungus precultivation on birch and ash sawdust media. The fungus growing in the dark showed the highest metabolic activity which was indicated by capacity to utilize a broad spectrum of compounds and the decomposition of 74/95 of the carbon sources. In all the culture light conditions, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid was the most readily metabolized compound. The greatest tolerance to chemicals was also observed during C. unicolor growth in darkness. The fungus was the most sensitive to nitrogen compounds and antibiotics, but more resistant to chelators. Comparative analysis of C. unicolor and selected wood-decay fungi from different taxonomic and ecological groups revealed average catabolic activity of the fungus. However, C. unicolor showed outstanding capabilities to catabolize salicin and arbutin. The obtained picture of C. unicolor metabolism showed that the fungus abilities to decompose woody plant material are influenced by various environmental factors."

However, few studies have explored the dependency of anthropometric characteristics and fitness from age category or the event preferred by gymnasts. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the somatic type, body composition and values of some anthropometric and fitness characteristics and indices of gymnasts according to age and preferred event. A total of 53 male gymnasts (19 seniors and 34 juniors) were examined right before the Polish Senior and Junior Championships in Artistic Gymnastics in Warsaw (May 25 to 28, 2017). We examined the characteristics of body length, skeletal system mass, muscle mass, skinfold thickness, and body mass (Tanita S.C.-330S). Body composition (Durnin and Womersley equations), somatotypes (Heath-Carter methodology), handgrip strength (Takei dynamometer), body balance (UPST), the power of the lower limbs (CMJ) were evaluated. Senior gymnasts presented higher than juniors experience, mesomorphy and had higher values in fitness tests of handgrip strength and power of lower limbs (p<0.05). The specialists in floor exercises and vault characterized in higher mesomorphy and lower ectomorphy (p<0.05) and better results of CMJ (p<0.05). We concluded: The seniors demonstrated natural predominance over juniors in several somatic and fitness variables. Detected differences can be useful in the process of identification and development of gymnastic talent. The detected effect of preferred event on certain variables that characterize body build and physical fitness can be useful for choosing a specialization in gymnastic event. A high skill level in all-around events at a national competitive level can be achieved by an athlete characterized by adequate experience, a mesomorphy somatotype component, lower limb index, pelvi-acromial index and relative HGSmax."
https://openalex.org/W2911854164,"Despite the fact that animal posture is known to reflect emotional state, the presence of chronic postures associated with poor welfare has not been investigated with an objective tool for measuring, quantifying and comparing postures. The use of morphometric geometrics (GM) to describe horse posture (profile of the dorsum) has shown to be an effective method of distinguishing populations that are known to differ in terms of welfare states. Here we investigated photographs of 85 riding school horses differing in terms of welfare state, in order to determine if a specific posture (modelled by GM) is associated with altered welfare. The welfare state was estimated with the prevalence of stereotypic or abnormal repetitive behaviours, depressed-like posture and the ear positions. ANOVA results show that horses with stereotypic or abnormal behaviour, and to a lesser degree horses with depressed-like postures, tend to have a flatter, or even hollow, dorsal profile, especially at the neck and croup levels. These altered profiles could represent an additional indicator of poor welfare, easy to use in the field or by owners."
https://openalex.org/W2912737345,"Ground subsidence and surface cracks caused by coal mining are typical man-made geological hazards that can severely damage the ecological environment and buildings. In China, within the theme of sustained and stable development, accurate assessment of mining-related building damage is paramount in order to address the contradiction between coal mining enterprises and building owners. Previous research in China focused mainly on the mining areas of plains, and only a few studies have considered building damage caused by intensive mining in mountainous areas. First, based on field investigation, this study located ground surface cracks and assessed the damage to buildings in the village of Nanyetou in Shanxi Province (China) attributable to the exploitation of the 15110 working face of the Baiyangling coal mine. Second, based on the mining subsidence law and boundary angle, the surface influenced boundary caused by underground mining was determined. However, as the existing subsidence theory cannot adequately explain the phenomenon of building damage, the damage was investigated from the perspective of slope stability analysis, and the slope safety factor before and after working face mining were calculated using the Janbu method. The analytical results showed that slope instability due to a decrease of the safety factor because of the coal mining activity was the principal reason for damage to the village buildings, a finding that was confirmed by field survey and InSAR monitoring displacement. The results of this study could provide guidance and reference for the assessment of building damage caused by underground mining in mountain areas."
https://openalex.org/W2913826244,"Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic RNA-protein aggregates formed in response to inhibition of translation initiation. SGs contribute to the stress response and are implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancer and some forms of neurodegeneration. Neurodegenerative diseases often involve chronic phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), with deletions of eIF2α kinases or treatment with eIF2α kinase inhibitors being protective in some animal models of disease. However, how and why the integrated stress response (ISR) is activated in different forms of neurodegeneration remains unclear. Because neuroinflammation is common to many neurodegenerative diseases, we hypothesized that inflammatory factors contribute to ISR activation in a cell-nonautonomous manner. Using fluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting, we show here that the endogenously produced product of inflammation, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15-d-PGJ2), triggers eIF2α phosphorylation, thereby activating the ISR, repressing bulk translation, and triggering SG formation. Our findings define a mechanism by which inflammation activates the ISR in a cell-nonautonomous manner and suggest that inhibition of 15-d-PGJ2 production might be a useful therapeutic strategy in some neuroinflammatory contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2912819517,"This paper evaluates the development impacts of migration and remittances in migrant source communities by applying insights from the New Economics of Labor Migration (NELM) theory to Ethiopia's migration. Using household survey data, we empirically evaluate how household participation in migration arises and so that the subsequent labor losses and the influx of remittances affect income sources and asset accumulation of smallholder farm households. To account several econometric issues and consistently estimate the impacts of migration and remittances, we adopted three-stage least-squares method complemented with endogeneity and multicollinearity test. Besides, using logistic and multinomial logistic regressions respectively, we estimate the determinants of the household migration decision to have migrants, as well as the probability of the household to send out temporary or permanent migrants. Findings suggest that larger and wealthier households are less likely to have migrant family members, while households living below the poverty line, as well as villages with the highest unemployment rate, are the most likely to have both temporary and permanent migrants. However, a rise in months spent out of agriculture has a significant negative effect on crop income and asset accumulation, but only for permanent migration. By contrast, the influx of remitted income from migrants has led to increased crop income and asset values in the form of land and livestock holdings. Finally, this manuscript provides more comprehensive evidence by showing the net-returns of migration in terms of initial lost-labor effects and the positive developmental impacts that it produces varied for households with different types of migration and production conditions."

Marine-derived nutrients from Pacific salmon (Onchorhycus spp.) can be transferred to streams and riparian forests through diverse food web pathways, fertilizing forests and increasing invertebrate abundance, which may in turn affect breeding birds. We quantified the influence of salmon on the abundance and composition of songbird communities across a wide range of salmon-spawning biomass on 14 streams along a remote coastal region of British Columbia, Canada. Point-count data spanning two years were combined with salmon biomass and 13 environmental covariates in riparian forests to test for correlates with bird abundance, foraging guilds, individual species, and avian diversity. We show that bird abundance and diversity increase with salmon biomass and that watershed size and forest composition are less important predictors. This work provides new evidence for the importance of salmon to terrestrial ecosystems and information that can inform ecosystem-based management."

Although a few studies have identified several circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) for cancer diagnosis, the complete plasma miRNA profile for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains undefined, and whether the plasma miRNA profiles are heterogeneous is unknown. Here, we obtained individualized plasma miRNA profiles of both healthy subjects and HCC patients via genome-wide deep sequencing. Compared with the highly stable miRNA profile of the healthy subjects, the profile of the HCC patients was highly variable. Seven miRNAs were optimized as potential plasma-based biomarkers for HCC diagnosis. Combined with the clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, three out of the seven miRNAs were correlated with the survival of the HCC patients. To investigate the effect of cancer cells on the plasma miRNAs profile, we compared the most differentially expressed miRNAs between plasma and tissues. Furthermore, miRNAseq data of HCC patients from TCGA were recruited for comparisons. We found that the differences between plasma and tissue were inconsistent, suggesting that other cells in addition to cancer cells also contribute to plasma miRNAs. Using two HCC cancer cell lines, we examined the levels of seven differentially expressed miRNAs. The reverse direction of certain miRNAs alterations between cancer cells and media further confirmed that miRNAs may be selectively pump out by cancer cells."

Knockdown of TgATP4 had no effect on resting pH or Ca2+ but rendered parasites unable to regulate their cytosolic Na+ concentration ([Na+]cyt). PfATP4 inhibitors caused an increase in [Na+]cyt and a cytosolic alkalinization in WT but not TgATP4 knockdown parasites. Parasites in which TgATP4 was knocked down or disrupted exhibited a growth defect, attributable to reduced viability of extracellular parasites.

https://openalex.org/W2898196509,"Music sampling is a common practice among hip-hop and electronic producers that has played a critical role in the development of particular subgenres. Artists preferentially sample drum breaks, and previous studies have suggested that these may be culturally transmitted. With the advent of digital sampling technologies and social media the modes of cultural transmission may have shifted, and music communities may have become decoupled from geography. The aim of the current study was to determine whether drum breaks are culturally transmitted through musical collaboration networks, and to identify the factors driving the evolution of these networks. Using network-based diffusion analysis we found strong evidence for the cultural transmission of drum breaks via collaboration between artists, and identified several demographic variables that bias transmission. Additionally, using network evolution methods we found evidence that the structure of the collaboration network is no longer biased by geographic proximity after the year 2000, and that gender disparity has relaxed over the same period. Despite the delocalization of communities by the internet, collaboration remains a key transmission mode of music sampling traditions. The results of this study provide valuable insight into how demographic biases shape cultural transmission in complex networks, and how the evolution of these networks has shifted in the digital age."
https://openalex.org/W2911795089,"Here we propose a single acid digestion (SAD) sample preparation method for ICP-MS analysis of animal serum samples to determine trace element contents. The method was evaluated in comparison with a commonly used procedure involving dilution of samples in an alkaline solution (AKD). In the SAD procedure, aliquots (1 mL) of bovine serum samples were treated at low temperature with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Trace elements (As, B, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sr, U, and Zn) were directly determined by ICP-MS analysis of diluted solutions of samples. Both methods were sufficiently sensitive to enable quantification of most trace elements, with the exception of the AKD method for Cd, Hg and Pb. The quality of the data was verified by using certified reference material. Good results were obtained for the SAD procedure and all elements, but recoveries were unacceptable with the AKD procedure for Se (recovery: 57%), Cd (154%) and Fe (139%).

A validated automatic tracking system (Venatrack) was used to code player actions in real time for passing accuracy, cross accuracy, corner accuracy and free kick accuracy. In total 376 of the 380 games played during the 2011-12 English premier League season were recorded, resulting in activity profiles of 570 players and over 35'000 rows of data. These data were analysed using multi-level modelling. Multi-level regression revealed a ""u"" shaped association between passing accuracy and goal difference (GD) with greater accuracy occurring at extremes of GD e.g., when the score was either positive or negative. The same pattern was seen for corner accuracy away from home e.g., corner accuracy was lowest when the score was close with the lowest accuracy at extremes of GD. Although free kicks were not associated with GD, team ability, playing position and pitch location were found to predict accuracy. No temporal variables were found to predict cross accuracy. A number of score line effects were present across the temporal factors which should be considered by coaches and managers when preparing and selecting teams in order to maximise performance. The current study highlighted the need for more sensitive score line definitions in which to consider score line effects."
https://openalex.org/W2913247508,"Sepsis represents a major health problem worldwide because of high mortality rates and cost-intensive therapy. Immunomodulatory strategies as a means of controlling overshooting inflammatory responses during sepsis have thus far not been effective, and there is a general paucity of new therapies. Regulatory immune cells have been shown to play important roles in limiting systemic inflammation. However, the signals inducing a regulatory phenotype in myeloid cells during infection are unknown. Here, we report that myeloid cell-intrinsic glycoprotein 130 (gp130) signals constitute a critical element for immune homeostasis during polymicrobial sepsis. We identify an essential role for gp130 signaling in myeloid cells during M2 macrophage polarization in vitro and in vivo. Myeloid cell-specific deletion of gp130 signaling leads to a defective M2 macrophage polarization followed by exacerbated inflammatory responses and increased mortality during sepsis. These data provide new insights into the molecular basis of M1 and M2 phenotypic dichotomy and identify gp130 as a key regulator of immune homeostasis during sepsis. Our study highlights the Janus-faced role of IL-6 family cytokines during inflammation, which may explain the failure of IL-6-targeted anti-inflammatory approaches in the treatment of sepsis.-Sackett, S.

Oxygen is life-saving in that context but induces injury in numerous organs. Here, we studied the structural and functional impact of hyperoxia on renal injury and its IL-6 dependency. Newborn wild-type (WT) and IL-6 knockout (IL-6-/-) mice were exposed to 85% O2 for 28 d, followed by room air until postnatal d (P) 70. Controls were in room air throughout life. At P28, hyperoxia reduced estimated kidney cortex area (KCA) in WT; at P70, KCA was greater, number of glomeruli was fewer, fractional potassium excretion was higher, and glomerular filtration rate was slightly lower than in controls. IL-6-/- mice were protected from these changes after hyperoxia. Mechanistically, the acute renal injury phase (P28) showed in WT but not in IL-6-/- mice an activation of IL-6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and TGF-β [mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad)2] signaling, increased inflammatory markers, disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis, and reduced tubular proliferation. Regenerative phase at P70 was characterized by tubular proliferation in WT but not in IL-6-/- mice. These data demonstrate that hyperoxia increases the risk of CKD through a novel IL-6-Smad2 axis. The amenability of these pathways to pharmacological approaches may offer new avenues to protect premature infants from CKD.-Mohr, J., Voggel, J., Vohlen, C., Dinger, K., Dafinger, C., Fink, G., Göbel, H., Liebau, M.

Postural adaptation involves specific sensorimotor processes integrating visual information and somesthesic information. The objective of this study was to examine this multisensorial integration on postural control, especially the use of visual and plantar information in static (stable) and dynamic (unstable) postures, among a group of expert horse rider women (n = 10) and a group of non-athlete women (n = 12). Postural control was evaluated through the center of pressure measured with a force platform on stable and unstable supports, with the eyes open and the eyes closed, and with the presence of foam on the support or not. Results showed that expert horse rider women had a better postural stability with unstable support in the mediolateral axis compared to non-athletes. Moreover, on the anteroposterior axis, expert horse riders were less visual dependent and more stable in the presence of foam. Results suggested that horseback riding could help developing particular proprioceptive abilities on standing posture as well as better postural muscle tone during particular bipodal dynamic perturbations. These outcomes provide new insights into horseback riding assets and methodological clues to assess the impact of sport practice."

https://openalex.org/W2896396873,"Leishmaniasis encompasses a group of diverse clinical diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. This disease is a major public health problem in the New World affecting people exposed in endemic regions. The city of Governador Valadares (Minas Gerais/Brazil) is a re-emerging area for visceral leishmaniasis, with 191 human cases reported from 2008 to 2017 and a lethality rate of 14.7%. The transmission of the parasite occurs intensely in this region with up to 22% of domestic dogs with positive serology for the visceral form. Lu. longipalpis is one of the most abundant sand fly species in this area. Despite this scenario, so far there is no information regarding the circulating Leishmania species in the insect vector Lutzomyia longipalpis in this focus. We collected 616 female Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies between January and September 2015 in the Vila Parque Ibituruna neighborhood (Governador Valadares/MG), which is located on a transitional area between the sylvatic and urban environments with residences built near a preserved area. After DNA extraction of individual sand flies, the natural Leishmania infections in Lu. longipalpis were detected by conventional PCR, using primers derived from kDNA sequences, specific for L. (Leishmania) or L. (Viannia) subgenus. The sensitivity of these PCR reactions was 0.1 pg of DNA for each Leishmania subgenus and the total infection rate of 16.2% (100 positive specimens). Species-specific PCR detected the presence of multiple Leishmania species in infected Lu. longipalpis specimens in Governador Valadares, including L. amazonensis (n = 3), L. infantum (n = 28), L. (Viannia) spp. (n = 20), coinfections with L. infantum and L. (Viannia) spp. (n = 5), and L. (Leishmania) spp (n = 44). Our results demonstrate that multiple Leishmania species circulate in Lu. longipalpis in Governador Valadares and reveal a potential increasing risk of transmission of the different circulating parasite species. This information reinforces the need for epidemiological and entomological surveillance in this endemic focus, and the development of effective control strategies against leishmaniasis."

In this article we report the location of panhandle-specific dsRNA and nonspecific ssRNA-binding sites in the stalk and head domains of the N protein, respectively. We show that both WT CCHFV N protein and its stalk domain bind with high affinity to the panhandle of hazara virus, another member of the Nairovirus genus. This suggests that N-panhandle interaction is likely genus-specific. Expression of CCHFV N protein stalk domain with intact panhandle-specific dsRNA-binding site inhibited the hazara virus replication in cell culture, demonstrating the role of N-panhandle interaction in the virus replication cycle. These studies demonstrate that N-panhandle interaction might be a novel target for therapeutic intervention of CCHFV infection. Using four independent binding approaches, we previously demonstrated that N protein specifically binds to the panhandle RNA structure composed of partially complementary 30 nucleotides from both 5′ and 3′ termini of CCHFV S-segment vRNA (Fig. 1B), with the same affinity as full-length vRNA (Kd ∼ 42 nm). The panhandle-N protein interaction occurred through the dsRNA-binding mode. However, N protein nonspecifically recognized the ssRNA through the ssRNA-binding mode. N protein remained in a unique conformational state when both ssRNA and dsRNA substrates were simultaneously bound to the protein. Competitive binding experiments suggested that N protein might have distinct binding pockets for dsRNA and ssRNA substrates. Using the X-ray crystal structure of the CCHFV N protein (strain YL04057, PDB code 3U3I), we modeled the 3D structure of CCHFV N protein (strain 10200). Although, the primary sequences of these two strains are slightly different, the modeled structure of strain 10200 is very similar to the X-ray structure of strain YL04057, and shows a distinct stalk domain composed of amino acids from 180 to 300, and a head domain composed of N-terminal 180 amino acids and C-terminal 182 amino acids (Fig. 1A). The electrostatic surface potential, generated by the PyMol viewer software tool, predicted two major RNA-binding regions based on the positively charged grooves at the surface of N protein structure. The isolated positively charged surface constituted by residues Lys-339, Lys-343, Lys-346, Arg-384, Lys-411, His-453, Arg-134, Arg-140, and Gln-467 in the head region, and His-195, His-197, Lys-222, Arg-225, Lys-282, and Lys-286 in the stalk region appear to constitute the two RNA-binding sites in the N protein structure. To determine whether the head and stalk domains harbored the panhandle-specific dsRNA and nonspecific ssRNA-binding sites, we cloned and purified the head and stalk domains of the CCHFV N protein in bacteria (Fig. 1, C and F). To delineate whether isolated positively charged surfaces in the head and stalk domains constitute the RNA-binding sites, we generated head and stalk domain mutants in which positively charged residues in the hypothetical RNA-binding pockets were converted to neutral amino acid alanine. In head domain mutant 12 (Fig. 1D) the three positively charged residues, Arg-339, Lys-343, and Lys-346, were converted to alanine, using site-directed mutagenesis. A similar approach was used to incorporate two point mutations in the head domain mutant 34 (Fig. 1E) replacing Arg-134 and Arg-140 with alanine. In the stalk mutant (Fig. 1G) two positively charged residues His-195 and His-197 were converted to alanine. All the mutants (Fig. 1, C–G) were purified by native procedure on a Ni-NTA column, using the C-terminal His tag. All the mutants were highly expressed in bacteria and their size matched with their respective molecular weights on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). We previously reported that WT CCHFV N protein specifically binds to the panhandle with a Kd value of 42 nm at 80 mm salt concentration (26Jeeva S. Pador S. Voss B. Ganaie S.S. Mir M.A. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus nucleocapsid protein has dual RNA binding modes.PloS One. 2017; 12 (28922369)e018493510.1371/journal.pone.0184935Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Kd value did not change at higher salt concentrations. In comparison, N protein nonspecifically bound to the single strand 5′ noncoding region (5′ NCR) of CCHFV S-segment RNA or any nonviral ssRNA with a Kd value of 125 nm at 80 mm salt concentration. The Kd value significantly increased with increasing salt concentrations. To identify the panhandle-specific dsRNA and nonspecific ssRNA-binding sites in the WT CCHFV N protein, we synthesized the panhandle composed of 30 nucleotides from both 5′ and 3′ termini of CCHFV S-segment vRNA, separated by a six-residue uracil loop (Fig. 2O) by in vitro T7 transcription reaction, as previously reported (26Jeeva S. Pador S. Voss B. Ganaie S.S. Mir M.A. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus nucleocapsid protein has dual RNA binding modes.PloS One. 2017; 12 (28922369)e018493510.1371/journal.pone.0184935Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The same strategy was used to synthesize the terminal 30 nucleotides of the 5′ NCR, represented as ssRNA in the text (Fig. 2O). Both panhandle and ssRNA were labeled with [32P]CTP during synthesis. We studied the binding of purified head and stalk domains with the synthetic panhandle and ssRNA sequence using two independent experimental approaches. An examination by filter-binding analysis revealed that the stalk domain bound to the panhandle RNA (Kd = 17 ± 2.1 nm) with 8-fold higher affinity compared with the ssRNA (Kd = 138 ± 9.6 nm) (Fig. 2, E and F). Conversely, the binding affinity of the head domain with the ssRNA (kd = 22 ± 1.3 nm) was 16-fold higher compared with the panhandle (Kd = 356 ± 16 nm) (Fig. 2, A and B). These data clearly shows that stalk and head domains preferably bind to panhandle and ssRNA, respectively. The dissociation constants for the binding of stalk and head domains with panhandle and ssRNA, respectively, are consistent with the previously reported dissociation constants for the binding of WT N protein with panhandle and ssRNA (26Jeeva S. Pador S. Voss B. Ganaie S.S. Mir M.A. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus nucleocapsid protein has dual RNA binding modes.PloS One. 2017; 12 (28922369)e018493510.1371/journal.pone.0184935Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Point mutations replacing the two positively charged amino acids His-195 and His-197 to alanine in the positively charged surface grove of the stalk domain (stalk mutant) abrogated the binding with the panhandle RNA (Fig. 2G and Table 1). Similarly, point mutations replacing the positively charged amino acids Arg-339, Lys-343, and Lys-346 (head mutant 12), and Arg-134 and Arg-140 (head mutant 34) with alanine abrogated the binding to the head domain with the ssRNA (Fig. 2, C and D, and Table 1). This suggests that isolated positively charged groves on the stalk and head domains, predicted by the PyMol viewer, likely constitute the panhandle and ssRNA-binding sites, respectively.Table 1Binding parameters calculated by two independent methodsProteinRNABiolayer interferometryFilter bindingKd ± S.D.KaKdisKd ± S.D.nmm−1 s−1s−1nmHeadPanhandle274 ± 122.09 ± 1045.737 × 10−3356 ± 9.0HeadssRNA4.3 ± 0.77.612 ± 1033.276 × 10−522 ± 1.3Head mutant 12ssRNA115 ± 5.52.646 ± 1044.448 × 10−3143 ± 16Head mutant 34ssRNA218 ± 108.134 ± 1046.456 × 10−3242 ± 14StalkPanhandle4.0 ± 0.51.62 ± 1046.514 × 10−617 ± 2.1StalkssRNA90 ± 9.02.055 ± 1041.858 × 10−3138 ± 9.6Stalk mutantPanhandle323 ± 117.452 ± 1042.411 × 10−2398 ± 14 Open table in a new tab To further confirm the results from filter-binding analysis, we monitored the association and dissociation kinetics of synthetic panhandle and ssRNA with head and stalk mutants, using biolayer interferometry on a BLITZ (ForteBio) instrument, as previously reported (26Jeeva S. Pador S. Voss B. Ganaie S.S. Mir M.A. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus nucleocapsid protein has dual RNA binding modes.PloS One. 2017; 12 (28922369)e018493510.1371/journal.pone.0184935Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar)(see “Experimental procedures” for details). The respective kinetic profiles are shown in Fig. 2, H–N, and the corresponding binding data are shown in Table 1. It is evident from Table 1 that dissociation constants calculated by biolayer interferometry followed the same trend and are in agreement with the dissociation constants calculated by the filter-binding analysis. The high affinity binding of panhandle and ssRNA with the stalk and head domains, respectively (Fig. 2, H and L, and Table 1), further confirms their binding sites in these respective domains. Interaction of head domain mutants with panhandle and stalk mutant with ssRNA was undetectable. Because N protein specifically binds to the vRNA panhandle; we asked whether this interaction takes place inside cells during viral infection. We developed a GFP reporter assay to further confirm the interaction between N protein and vRNA panhandle inside the cells. Briefly, the panGFP plasmid was constructed for the expression of GFP reporter mRNA having 5′ and 3′ NCR sequences of CCHFV S-segment vRNA upstream of the start codon and downstream of the stop codon, respectively (Fig. 3A). The expression is driven from a T7 promoter and the 3′ end of the GFP reporter mRNA is defined by the engineered hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme sequence. The mRNA likely forms a panhandle structure due to complementarity of the nucleotides between the 5′ and 3′ termini (Fig. 3A). Unlike eukaryotic mRNA, the mRNA expressed from panGFP plasmid does not have a 5′ cap and 3′ poly(A) tail. The BSRT7.5 cells stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase (gift from Dr. Conzelman, Germany) were cotransfected with panGFP reporter plasmid along with another plasmid expressing WT CCHFV N protein or head domain, head domain mutant 12, stalk domain, stalk domain mutant, N protein mut1, or N protein mut2. The N protein mut1 and N protein mut2 are derived from WT CCHFV N protein, and have a single point mutation (His-195 to Ala-195) and two point mutations (His-195 and His-197 to Ala) in their stalk domains, respectively. The GFP expression was monitored using either fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B) or flow cytometry (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, a strong GFP expression was observed in cells co-expressing the WT CCHFV N protein (Fig. 3, B and D). A weaker GFP signal was observed in cells co-expressing N protein mut1. To ensure that changes in GFP expression were not due to changes in the mRNA levels, we quantified GFP mRNA in cell lysates by real time PCR. It is evident from Fig. 3F that GFP mRNA was equally expressed in cells. An examination of cell lysates by Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of WT N protein, head domain, head domain mutant 34, stalk domain, stalk domain mutant, N protein mut1, and N protein mut2 from the transfected plasmids (Fig. 3C). It is likely that formation of panhandle with a strong secondary structure prevented ribosome engagement and thus inhibited the translation of GFP reporter mRNA in cells. We previously reported that CCHFV N protein does not have the RNA helix unwinding activity (29Jeeva S. Cheng E. Ganaie S.S. Mir M.A. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus nucleocapsid protein augments mRNA translation.J. Virol. 2017; 91 (28515298)e00636Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and thus the possible unwinding of the panhandle after high affinity binding with N protein to stimulate the translation of GFP reporter mRNA does not seem likely. We also reported previously that CCHFV N protein facilitates mRNA translation possibly by simultaneous binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit and RNA sequence upstream of start codon (29Jeeva S. Cheng E. Ganaie S.S. Mir M.A. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus nucleocapsid protein augments mRNA translation.J. Virol. 2017; 91 (28515298)e00636Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Based on these previous observations, it is likely that simultaneous binding of N protein with both the 40S ribosomal subunit and the panhandle structure facilitated the ribosome engagement close to the start codon of the GFP reporter mRNA, resulting in the translation of the GFP reporter transcript in cells (Fig. 2B, ii). This is indirectly supported by the observation that incorporation of mutations in the stalk domain of the WT N protein impacted the N protein-mediated translation of the reporter mRNA (Fig. 3B, vii and viii). To confirm that WT N protein and stalk domain remained bound to the panhandle structure in cells, the cell lysates from Fig. 3B were incubated with Ni-NTA beads to pulldown the proteins expressed from transfected plasmids, using the C-terminal His tag. The volume of the lysates was adjusted to ensure an equal amount of GFP mRNA for the respective samples loaded on Ni-NTA beads. Total RNA was purified from the pulldown material and the GFP mRNA was identified by PCR using gene-specific primers. It is evident from Fig. 3E that GFP reporter mRNA co-purified with WT N protein, N protein mut1, and stalk domain, confirming their binding with the panhandle structure. Poor GFP signal due to co-expression of N protein mut1 (Fig. 3B, vii) is likely due to the weaker binding of this mutant with the panhandle. This is indirectly supported by the observation that incorporation of two point mutations in the stalk domain of WT N protein abrogated both panhandle binding (Fig. 3E, viii) and N protein-mediated translation of the GFP reporter mRNA (Fig. 3B, viii). To confirm that panhandle formation inhibited the translation of GFP reporter mRNA (Fig. 3B, i), and N protein-panhandle binding triggered the translation of GFP reporter in cells (Fi"

However, besides TNF, etanercept also blocks lymphotoxin-α (LTα), which has no clear therapeutic value and might aggravate some of the adverse effects associated with etanercept. Poxviruses encode soluble TNFR2 homologs, termed viral TNF decoy receptors (vTNFRs), that display unique specificity properties. For instance, cytokine response modifier D (CrmD) inhibits mouse and human TNF and mouse LTα, but it is inactive against human LTα. Here, we analyzed the molecular basis of these immunomodulatory activities in the ectromelia virus–encoded CrmD. We found that the overall molecular mechanism to bind TNF and LTα from mouse and human origin is fairly conserved in CrmD and dominated by a groove under its 50s loop. However, other ligand-specific binding determinants optimize CrmD for the inhibition of mouse ligands, especially mouse TNF. Moreover, we show that the inability of CrmD to inhibit human LTα is caused by a Glu-Phe-Glu motif in its 90s loop. Importantly, transfer of this motif to etanercept diminished its anti-LTα activity in >60-fold while weakening its TNF-inhibitory capacity in 3-fold. This new etanercept variant could potentially be used in the clinic as a safer alternative to conventional etanercept. This work is the most detailed study of the vTNFR–ligand interactions to date and illustrates that a better knowledge of vTNFRs can provide valuable information to improve current anti-TNF therapies.

https://openalex.org/W2913758303,"In all eukaryotes, a functional mitotic spindle is essential for distributing duplicated chromosomes into daughter cells. Mitotic spindle assembly involves highly ordered arrangement of microtubules (MTs). The Augmin protein complex recruits γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to MTs and thereby promotes MT-based MT nucleation and mitotic spindle assembly. However, several factors that may promote Augmin recruitment to MTs remain unknown. Here, we show that echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 3 (EML3), an MT-associated protein, facilitates binding between MTs and Augmin/γ-TuRC and recruiting the latter to MTs for proper mitotic spindle assembly and kinetochore–MT connections. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, live-cell imaging, and immunoprecipitation assays, we found that EML3 recruits Augmin/γ-TuRC to the MTs to enhance MT-based MT nucleation in both spindle and small acentrosomal asters. We also noted that the EML3-mediated recruitment is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which phosphorylated EML3 at Thr-881 and promoted its binding to Augmin/γ-TuRC. RNAi-mediated EML3 knockdown in HeLa cells reduced spindle localization of Augmin/γ-TuRC, which resulted in abnormal spindle assembly and caused kinetochore–MT misconnection. The introduction of exogenous WT or a Thr-881 phosphorylation mimic EML3 variant into the EML3 knockdown cells restored normal Augmin/γ-TuRC localization and spindle assembly. The EML3 knockdown also affected the spindle assembly checkpoint, delaying chromosome congression and cell division. Taken together, our results indicate that EML3 regulates mitotic spindle assembly and the kinetochore–MT connection by regulating MT-based MT nucleation and recruiting Augmin/γ-TuRC to MTs.

In higher eukaryotes, these MT arrays emanate primarily from the main MT organization center, the centrosomes.

Using Xenopus egg extracts, it has been shown that MT-based MT nucleation is stimulated by Ran-GTP and its co-effector, TPX2 (22Petry S. Groen A.C. Ishihara K. Mitchison T.J. Vale R.D. Branching microtubule nucleation in Xenopus egg extracts mediated by augmin and TPX2.Cell. 2013; 152 (23415226): 768-77710.1016/j.cell.2012.12.044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, whether other factors regulate Augmin recruitment to the MTs for MT-based MT nucleation remains unknown. EML3 (echinoderm MT-associated protein-like protein 3) is a MAP that is required for correct chromosome alignment in metaphase (28Tegha-Dunghu J. Neumann B. Reber S. Krause R. Erfle H. Walter T. Held M. Rogers P. Hupfeld K. Ruppert T. Ellenberg J. Gruss O.J. EML3 is a nuclear microtubule-binding protein required for the correct alignment of chromosomes in metaphase.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121 (18445686): 1718-172610.1242/jcs.019174Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. In this work, we found that EML3 regulates the MT-based MT nucleation for proper MT density in the mitotic spindle body in mammalian cells. We reveal that EML3 recruits Augmin and γ-TuRC to existing MTs in a CDK1 phosphorylation-dependent manner to initiate MT-based MT nucleation. EML3 RNAi knockdown in cells leads to the reduction of spindle-localized Augmin and γ-TuRC, a decrease in MT density in the spindle body, and chromosome congression failure. Taken together, our data reveal a novel mechanism of how EML3 regulates mitotic spindle assembly and the kinetochore–MT connection via recruitment of Augmin and γ-TuRC to MT for MT-based MT nucleation. First, to reveal the functions of EML3 in mitosis, we performed siRNA knockdown experiments in HeLa cells (Fig. 1, A–C) and investigated the effects of EML3 knockdown on mitotic spindle dynamics. Through immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM), we observed that EML3 knockdown resulted in chromosome misalignment and MT density decrease (Fig. 1, A and B) as measured according to the reports (Fig. S1B) (19Goshima G. Mayer M. Zhang N. Stuurman N. Vale R.D. Augmin: A protein complex required for centrosome-independent microtubule generation within the spindle.J.

Because γ-TuRC nucleates MTs at both the centrosomes and the spindle MTs, and loss of γ-TuRC on the spindle MTs results in reduced MT density within the spindle body (10Lüders J. Patel U.K. Stearns T. GCP-WD is a gamma-tubulin targeting factor required for centrosomal and chromatin-mediated microtubule nucleation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 (16378099): 137-14710.1038/ncb1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), we immunostained cells with a specific antibody against γ-tubulin, the main component of γ-TuRC. The results showed that the γ-tubulin signal on the spindle body MTs was significantly reduced in EML3 knockdown cells compared with the control (Fig. 1, A and B). Meanwhile, the microtubule-associated protein TACC3 was retained on the spindle (Fig. 1A). We also performed time-lapse microscopy in EML3 knockdown cells and found that, unlike the dramatic reduction of the spindle body MTs in mitosis, the situation of MTs in interphase was not significantly changed (Fig. S1A and Movie S1). As several reports have shown that Augmin recruits γ-TuRC to the MT lattice to take part in MT amplification within the spindle body in different cell types (19Goshima G. Mayer M. Zhang N.

Interestingly, we observed a MT density reduction in hDgt6 knockdown cells similar to that found in EML3 knockdown cells (Fig. 1, A–C). In addition, we found that hDgt6 knockdown led to reduced protein levels of Uchil5ip and Hice1 (two subunits of Augmin), whereas the protein expression of Nedd1 and γ-tubulin (γ-TuRC components) was not affected (Fig. 1D), which indicated that hDgt6 knockdown may substitute knockdown of the whole Augmin complex. Then, we constructed a GFP-tagged full-length EML3 expression vector (GFP-EML3) for the first time by joining an N-terminal truncate (EML3 aa1–116) cloned from a cDNA library and an EML3 truncate (EML3 aa116–896, a kind gift from Dr. Gruss) and expressed it in HeLa cells. The results show that GFP-EML3 associated with the spindle body MTs but not the poles in mitosis and additionally with the interphase MTs during the cell cycle (Fig. S1C). We also observed that Flag-EML3 co-localized with hDgt6 on the mitotic spindle (Fig. S1D). Through co-expression of Flag-EML3 with GFP-tagged Augmin subunits in HEK293 cells followed by co-IP, we found that EML3 interacted with multiple subunits of Augmin (Fig. 1G). Through co-IP assays, we also showed that EML3 and γ-tubulin were co-immunoprecipitated with each other (Fig. 1, E and F). IFM revealed that EML3 and Augmin subunits were co-localized on the spindle body MTs during mitosis (Fig. S1E). Because of the absence of centrosomal localization of EML3, we speculated that EML3 bound with Augmin and γ-TuRC only on the mitotic spindle body MTs. By knocking down hDgt6 in GFP-EML3–expressing cells, we found that although hDgt6 knockdown led to dissociation of Hice1 from the spindle body MTs, this knockdown had little effect on the spindle body MT localization of EML3 (Fig. 1H). This suggested that EML3 situates between Augmin and the spindle body MTs and that EML3 can localize alone to the spindle body MTs without Augmin. To confirm this proposition, we immunostained hDgt6 and γ-tubulin in EML3 knockdown cells, revealing that EML3 knockdown significantly reduced hDgt6 and γ-tubulin signals on spindle body MTs and the MT density of the spindle body (Fig. 1, I and J). This demonstrated that EML3 mediates the localization of Augmin and γ-TuRC to the spindle body MTs. Taking these findings together, we propose that EML3 functions upstream of Augmin and γ-TuRC and participates in MT-based MT nucleation of the spindle body through recruitment of Augmin and γ-TuRC to spindle MTs. In mammalian cells, Augmin recruits γ-TuRC to spindle MTs to initiate daughter MTs at the same polarity as mother MTs (22Petry S. Groen A.C. Ishihara K. Mitchison T.J. Vale R.D.

Because daughter MTs can also serve as mother MTs, Augmin-dependent MT nucleation can rapidly generate fan-shaped MT arrays that interact and fuse to form a “plump” mitotic spindle (22Petry S.

To confirm the EML3 function in mitotic spindle assembly, we performed time-lapse microscopy using a cell line stably expressing GFP-α-tubulin (Fig. 2A). In control cells we observed that, in addition to the large centrosomal MT aster assembly around the centrosomes, many small acentrosomal MT asters also assembled around the disassembling nucleus and grew quickly during mitotic entry (Fig. 2A and Movie S2, marked by arrows). After nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), these small acentrosomal MT asters were connected with the condensed chromosomes and quickly sorted into large MT asters to form the bipolar spindle (Fig. 2, A and B, boxes a and b). Importantly, we observed that the MTs within the spindle increased dramatically and were sorted into the bipolar spindle until a normal high spindle body MT density was achieved (Fig. 2A and Movie S2). In contrast, in EML3 knockdown cells, we observed a significant reduction in MT density in the spindle body and a decrease in the growth rate of the small acentrosomal MT asters (Fig. 2, A and B, box c, and Movie S3). Most likely because the MT density of the spindle body was much lower, the chromosome alignment was obviously abnormal in EML3 knockdown cells (Fig. 2A). Consistently, in hDgt6 knockdown cells we also observed very similar results to that in EML3 knockdown cells (Fig. 2, A and B, boxes d and e, and Movie S4). We also performed a MT regrowth assay in HeLa cells to verify the role of EML3 in regulating mitotic spindle assembly. The cells were treated on ice for 1 h to depolymerize their spindle MTs followed by release into a warm medium to allow MT regrowth. We observed that whereas MTs in control cells rapidly grew to reform the bipolar spindle with proper chromosome alignment, the growth of the MTs in EML3 or hDgt6 knockdown cells showed a significant reduction, resulting in an obvious decrease in both spindle reformation efficiency and spindle body MT density (Fig. 2C). More importantly, we revealed that the chromosomes did not align well on the equatorial plate in EML3 knockdown cells (Fig. 2C). Together, these results show that EML3 is required for rapid MT amplification, efficient spindle assembly, and proper chromosome alignment during mitosis. In addition to the big centrosomal MT asters, the small acentrosomal MT asters also contribute to spindle assembly through binding and sorting into the big centrosomal MT asters (4Fu W. Chen H.

To verify whether EML3 also regulates the small acentrosomal MT aster formation, we treated cells with 500 ng/ml nocodazole for 2 h to disassemble their MTs followed by releasing these cells into fresh medium containing a low concentration of nocodazole (30 ng/ml) to induce the acentrosomal MT nucleation (4Fu W.

We revealed that many small acentrosomal MT asters were assembled in the control cells and that EML3 and Augmin subunits associated with these small acentrosomal MT asters (Figs. 3A and S2A). We also observed that, whereas the centrosome-based MT nucleation was partially inhibited in the presence of this low concentration of nocodazole, the acentrosomal MT nucleation was induced, and these nucleated MTs rapidly assembled into many small acentrosomal asters (Fig. 3, A and B, and Movie S5). In contrast, in EML3 or hDgt6 knockdown cells we found that the numbers of small acentrosomal MT asters were significant reduced (Fig. 3, B and C, and Movies S6 and S7). Through immunostaining of the fixed cells, we also observed the acentrosomal microtubule assembly, and the results were consistent with that in the live cells (Fig. 3D). Through immunostaining for γ-tubulin, Nedd1, and TACC3, we revealed that, although γ-tubulin and Nedd1 localized mainly to the aster centers, most TACC3 were situated on the aster MTs (Fig. S2B). Immunoprecipitation assay showed that the Augmin subunit Hice1 bound with EML3 and γ-tubulin but not with TACC3 (Fig. S2C). These results were consistent with our previous reports that γ-tubulin and Nedd1 take parts in MT nucleation, whereas TACC3 and short MTs bind each other to form small TACC3-MT seeds near the kinetochores along with the assembly of the big centrosomal asters (3Fu W.

To investigate how hit songs are recognized over time, we randomly selected number-one Billboard singles from the last 76 years and presented them to a large sample of mostly millennial participants. In response to hearing each song, participants were prompted to indicate whether they recognized it. Plotting the recognition proportion for each song as a function of the year during which it reached peak popularity resulted in three distinct phases in collective memory. The first phase is characterized by a steep linear drop-off in recognition for the music from this millennium; the second phase consists of a stable plateau during the 1960s to the 1990s; and the third phase, a further but more gradual drop-off during the 1940s and 1950s. More than half of recognition variability can be accounted for by self-selected exposure to each song as measured by its play count on Spotify. We conclude that collective memory for popular music is different from that of other historical phenomena."

The predicted structure, domain organization, and DNA-binding characteristics of TraB suggest that the TraB conjugation system is derived from an FtsK-like ancestor (6Vogelmann J. Ammelburg M.

TraB-recognition sequence type IV secretion system. This conjugative mechanism is different from other plasmid-encoded conjugation complexes that translocate DNA through a type IV secretion system (T4SS). Conjugative T4SS consists of at least 12 proteins involved in the processing of the plasmid, the formation of a core channel complex, the assembly of a pilus for cell-to-cell contacts, and also in supplying energy for pilus biogenesis and substrate transport (10Cabezón E. Ripoll-Rozada J. Peña A. de la Cruz F. Arechaga I. Toward an integrated model of bacterial conjugation.FEMS Microbiol.

One of these proteins, known as coupling protein because it connects the DNA processing machinery to the secretion channel, is an ATPase that belongs to the FtsK-like family of proteins. The prototype for the T4SS coupling proteins is TrwB, from plasmid R388. TrwB is a hexameric DNA-dependent ATPase implicated in the transfer of the plasmid as an ssDNA molecule (12Tato I. Zunzunegui S. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. TrwB, the coupling protein involved in DNA transport during bacterial conjugation, is a DNA-dependent ATPase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In contrast, the FtsK pore is 30 Å wide, which allows for the passage of dsDNA (13Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. Pérez-Luque R. González A. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. Coll M. The bacterial conjugation protein TrwB resembles ring helicases and F1-ATPase.Nature. 2001; 409 (11214325): 637-64110.1038/35054586Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 14Massey T.H.

Contrary to FtsK-like motors, TrwB-like proteins do not contain a γ-domain involved in the specific recognition of a plasmid sequence. Instead, substrate binding is mediated by the interaction with accessory proteins (15Tato I. Matilla I. Arechaga I. Zunzunegui S. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. The ATPase activity of the DNA transporter TrwB is modulated by protein TrwA: Implications for a common assembly mechanism of DNA translocating motors.J. Biol.

Alfonso C. Rivas G. Bolt E.L. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. The conjugative DNA translocase TrwB is a structure-specific DNA-binding protein.J. Biol.

These secondary DNA structures have been proposed to act as loading sites for the motor. G-quadruplex structures are formed in G-rich DNA sequences by the pairing of four guanines in a planar array (17Williamson J.R. G-quartet structures in telomeric DNA.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23 (7919797): 703-73010.1146/annurev.bb.23.060194.003415Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). These structural motifs are widespread in genomes and act as control elements in essential biological processes, such as replication or transcription (18London T.B. Barber L.J. Mosedale G. Kelly G.P. Balasubramanian S. Hickson I.D. Boulton S.J. Hiom K. FANCJ is a structure-specific DNA helicase associated with the maintenance of genomic G/C tracts.J. Biol.

Interestingly, KOPS, SRS, and TRS sequences are also G-rich sequences and, therefore, might form G-quadruplex structures that could act as loading sites. In this work, we have observed that TraB from plasmid pSVH1 binds G-quadruplex structures with higher affinity than TRS sequences. The γ-domain of TraB is not required for the recognition of these secondary structures. Therefore, the motor domain, common to TrwB-like proteins, is responsible for this DNA-binding mode. Comparative genomic analysis of the motor domain of FtsK-, SpoIIIE-, TraB-, and TrwB-like proteins revealed that these proteins are closely related, sharing an evolutionary common ancestor (19Cabezon E. Lanza V.F. Arechaga I. Membrane-associated nanomotors for macromolecular transport.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2012; 23 (22189002): 537-54410.1016/j.copbio.2011.11.031Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that they also share a similar mechanism of loading, recognizing secondary DNA structures to establish the first DNA contacts. We have also characterized the enzymatic activity of the protein, showing that TraB is a DNA-dependent ATPase, highly stimulated by dsDNA substrates. The structural analysis of the protein by EM showed the existence of high-order oligomeric complexes that might be formed by the assembly of four TraB hexamers. Although at present is not possible to know if the formation of these high-order oligomeric structures is relevant for TraB function in vivo, all together, these results shed light on the mechanism used by this family of membrane-associated motors for DNA binding and translocation. The soluble domain of TraB protein (TraBs), attached to a His-tag at the N terminus (Fig. 1A), was purified to homogeneity and analyzed for ATPase activity in the presence and absence of different DNA substrates under various conditions. The activity was very sensitive to pH, with an optimal range between 5.8 and 6.4 (Fig. 1B). In the absence of DNA, the activity of the protein was ∼2000 nmol ATP min−1 mg−1. ATP hydrolysis was stimulated 35-fold in the presence of dsDNA (Vmax = 72,950 ± 2360 nmol ATP min−1 mg−1), whereas ssDNA caused a 12-fold stimulation (Vmax = 24,870 ± 2380 nmol ATP min−1 mg−1) (Fig. 1C). These values were obtained with DNA substrates lacking the specific TRS recognition sequence. It is important to note that these values were much higher than previously reported data for a full-length strepII-TraB fusion protein (Vmax = 800 nmol ATP min−1 mg−1) (8Reuther J. Gekeler C. Tiffert Y. Wohlleben W. Muth G. Unique conjugation mechanism in mycelial streptomycetes: A DNA-binding ATPase translocates unprocessed plasmid DNA at the hyphal tip.Mol.

Moreover, in that previous work the described ATPase activity was not DNA-dependent. The ATPase assays were performed at pH 8, which is not an optimal pH value for measuring this activity. As shown in Fig. 1B, TraBs activity shows a high dependence on low pH values. Because in the previous report a full-length strepII-TraB protein was used, we cannot exclude the possibility that the N-terminal domain had an effect on the DNA-dependent ATPase activity. More likely, the pH dependence observed here might explain the absence of DNA-dependent ATPase activity reported in those previous experiments. TraB has been reported to have a specific DNA-binding activity, recognizing 8-bp TRS motifs within the clt region of the pSVH1 plasmid (6Vogelmann J. Ammelburg M. Finger C. Guezguez J. Linke D. Flötenmeyer M. Stierhof Y.D. Wohlleben W. Muth G. Conjugal plasmid transfer in Streptomyces resembles bacterial chromosome segregation by FtsK/SpoIIIE.EMBO J. 2011; 30 (21505418): 2246-225410.1038/emboj.2011.121Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This mode of interaction with the DNA is reminiscent of the 8-bp KOPS and SRS motifs recognized by FtsK or SpoIIIE, respectively. In these proteins, the interaction with DNA motifs involves the γ-domain of the protein (5Ptacin J.L. Nollmann M. Becker E.C. Cozzarelli N.R. Pogliano K. Bustamante C. Sequence-directed DNA export guides chromosome translocation during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.Nat. Struct. Mol.

In an attempt to determine whether the recognition of TRS motifs affected the activity of TraBs, ATP turnover was analyzed using complementary 45-mer oligonucleotides containing part of the clt sequence of the pSVH1 plasmid, which includes three copies of the 8-bp TRS sequence (Fig. 2A) (oligonucleotides C and D from Table 1). As shown in Fig. 2B (black bars), no significant differences were found in ATP turnover when compared with nonspecific complementary 45-mer oligonucleotides (oligonucleotides A and B from Table 1). Independently of the presence or absence of the specific clt sequence and TRS repeats, TraBs basal ATPase activity was always increased by 30-fold.Table 1Sequence of oligonucleotides used for substrate preparationOligoSequence (5′–3′)AAAGGACGAAAACCTGTGTAGTGTTATGCCACTACAATATTGCCGCBGCGGCAATATTGTAGTGGCATAACACTACACAGGTTTTCGTCCTTCaTRS sequences are underlined.GACCGGGCCCCGACCCGGACGCCGGAGTGCCCGACCCGGACGCCCDbG-clusters are indicated by bold letters.GGGCGTCCGGGTCGGGCACTCCGGCGTCCGGGTCGGGGCCCGGTCEaTRS sequences are underlined.ATGCCACTACAATATTGCCGCGACCCGGAGACCCGGAGACCCGGAFTCCGGGTCTCCGGGTCTCCGGGTCGCGGCAATATTGTAGTGGCATGATGCCACTACAATATTGCCGCTCCGGGTCTCCGGGTCTCCGGGTCHaTRS sequences are underlined.GACCCGGAGACCCGGAGACCCGGAGCGGCAATATTGTAGTGGCATIbG-clusters are indicated by bold letters.TCGCCACGTTTCGCCGTTTGCGGGGGTTTCTGCGAGGAACTTTGGa TRS sequences are underlined.b G-clusters are indicated by bold letters. Open table in a new tab Next, we analyzed the effect of the γ-domain on the ATPase activity of the protein. Previous data obtained with SpoIIIE protein indicated that the γ-domain was inhibiting the ATPase activity of the protein in the absence of DNA (21Besprozvannaya M. Pivorunas V.L. Feldman Z. Burton B.M. SpoIIIE protein achieves directional DNA translocation through allosteric regulation of ATPase activity by an accessory domain.J. Biol.

Therefore, we purified TraBsΔγ (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1) and the activity of the two proteins was compared. Contrary to what was observed with SpoIIIE, TraBs and TraBsΔγ presented a similar ATP turnover (black and gray bars in Fig. 2B), both in the absence and in the presence of the two types of dsDNA substrates. Although the removal of the γ-domain did not affect the ATPase activity of the protein, previous studies had shown that the TraB γ-domain binds preferentially to TRS sequences over random DNA (6Vogelmann J. Ammelburg M. Finger C. Guezguez J. Linke D. Flötenmeyer M. Stierhof Y.D. Wohlleben W. Muth G.

Therefore, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with the same 45-bp dsDNA fragments that were used in the ATPase assays, with and without the specific clt sequence. Fig. 2C shows that only the dsDNA fragment containing the specific sequence is retarded, with an apparent Kd value of 0.9 μm. Deletion of the γ-domain results in a DNA-binding defect, as previously reported (6Vogelmann J. Ammelburg M. Finger C. Guezguez J. Linke D. Flötenmeyer M. Stierhof Y.D. Wohlleben W. Muth G.

KOPS and SRS motifs are involved in directing motion during chromosome segregation of FtsK and SpoIIIE translocases, respectively (5Ptacin J.L. Nollmann M. Becker E.C. Cozzarelli N.R. Pogliano K. Bustamante C. Sequence-directed DNA export guides chromosome translocation during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Both translocases move toward the terminus and, therefore, the motors can find these asymmetric motifs in two different orientations: permissive orientation (pointing to the terminus) and nonpermissive orientation (pointing to the origin). At present, there are different models that try to explain how the motors deal with these motifs (20Löwe J. Ellonen A. Allen M.D. Atkinson C. Sherratt D.J. Grainge I.

A recent work on SpoIIIE has shown that permissive SRS sequences increase the ATPase activity more than 20-fold above the values obtained with random DNA or nonpermissive SRS (21Besprozvannaya M. Pivorunas V.L. Feldman Z. Burton B.M. SpoIIIE protein achieves directional DNA translocation through allosteric regulation of ATPase activity by an accessory domain.J. Biol.

In an attempt to determine whether the stimulation of TraB ATPase activity could be linked to the sensing of the TRS motif in a particular orientation or to the existence of sufficient DNA for a correct loading, we analyzed the turnover of the protein in the presence of two types of synthetic dsDNA. These new dsDNA fragments were long enough to accommodate the assembly of the protein in any orientation and were designed in the same way as those used in the work with SpoIIIE (21Besprozvannaya M. Pivorunas V.L. Feldman Z. Burton B.M. SpoIIIE protein achieves directional DNA translocation through allosteric regulation of ATPase activity by an accessory domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 (23974211): 28962-2897410.1074/jbc.M113.484055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The substrates contained either three overlapping TRS sequences in a “permissive” orientation (3 × TRS) (oligonucleotides E and F from Table 1), or three overlapping TRS sequences in the reverse orientation (3 × revTRS) (oligonucleotides G and H from Table 1) (Fig. 3A). However, it is important to note that the termini “permissive” and “nonpermissive” are not related to the origin of the plasmid but to the two possible orientations that the sequences can acquire in the plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3B, the ATPase activity of the protein in the presence of the three overlapping TRS sequences, in any orientation, was similar to that obtained with random DNA. The values obtained for TraBs and TraBsΔγ proteins were very similar with all the dsDNA substrates tested. Therefore, we can conclude that the ATPase activity of TraBs is independent of the TRS sequence and its orientation. To analyze the binding preferences of TraB, we performed EMSA with the two types of substrates. The affinity was similar for both substrates (Kd values of 1.8 and 2.2 μm, respectively), but lower than that obtained for the substrate that contains three TRS sequences together with part of the clt sequence (Kd = 0.9 μm). This result might indicate that the affinity of TraBs for the clt sequence is not only determined by TRS motifs and it might need a larger DNA fragment. Streptomyces species and their plasmids have a high G + C content in their DNA. More specifically, the GC content of the clt region of plasmid pSVH1 containing the 8-bp TRS repeats is 80% (Fig. 2A). It is well-known that G-rich sequences are involved in the formation of G-quadruplex structures on DNA (G4 DNA) (17Williamson J.R. G-quartet structures in telomeric DNA.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23 (7919797): 703-73010.1146/annurev.bb.23.060194.003415Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that TrwB, a motor that belongs to the FtsK-like family which is involved in DNA transfer in Gram-negative bacteria, presents a high affinity for G-quadruplex structures (16Matilla I. Alfonso C. Rivas G. Bolt E.L. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. The conjugative DNA translocase TrwB is a structure-specific DNA-binding protein.J. Biol.

These data, together with the fact that TraBs presents higher affinity for the clt sequence than for just overlapping TRS sequences, prompted us to analyze the interaction of TraBs with intermolecular G-quadruplex structures. To this end, G4 DNA was formed with the 45-mer oligonucleotide I (Table 1), following a specific protocol to obtain this type of DNA secondary structures, as reported previously (16Matilla I. Alfonso C. Rivas G. Bolt E.L. de la Cruz F. Cabezon E. The conjugative DNA translocase TrwB is a structure-specific DNA-binding protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (20375020): 17537-1754410.1074/jbc.M109.084137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (see also “Experimental procedures”). Gel shift assays indicated that TraBs binds G4 DNA with higher affinity than TRS sequences (Fig. 4A). Moreover, TraBsΔγ protein was able to bind G4 DNA almost to the same extent as TraBs, which indicates that the γ-domain is not required for the recognition of this type of structures on the DNA. The analysis and quantification of the TraBs gel shift assays with different DNA substrates showed an apparent Kd value of 23 nm for G4 DNA, 900 nm for dsDNA with the clt sequence, and 1.9 μm for dsDNA with three overlapping TRS sequences (Fig. 4B). As mentioned, TraBsΔγ protein was only able to bind G4 DNA, with a Kd value of 190 nm. All together, these results suggest that TraB might have an initial contact with the DNA by recognizing G-quadruplex structures, without the involvement of the γ-domain. The last purification step of TraBs, consisting of a size exclusion chromatography, showed two different oligomerization states of the protein (Fig. 5). The elution profile exhibited two major protein peaks: peak 1, corresponding to the void volume of the column, and peak 2, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa (compatible with the predicted molecular mass of the monomer). The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, confirming that both peaks corresponded to different forms of TraBs protein (data not shown). Variations on the pH value or on the glycerol content of the buffer shifted the balance in favor of a particular oligomeric state, suggesting there was an equilibrium between the two distinct oligomeric species (Fig. S2). EM analysis of fractions from peak 1 revealed a monodisperse sample of single particles, with an apparent diameter of ∼200 Å (Fig. 6A). A 3D reconstruction obtained after classification of these particles revealed a high-order structure, compatible with the assembly of four hexamers. A rotational symmetry analysis of the particles supported the existence of a 4-fold symmetry along the z axis.Figure 63D reconstruction of TraBs oligomer.

Contrast-enhanced carotid ultrasound was used to assess the VV density. Patients with SAHS (80%) showed a higher adventitial VV density (0.801±0.125 vs. 0.697±0.082, p = 0.005) and higher levels of sVCAM-1 (745.2±137.8 vs. 643.3±122.7 ng/ml, p = 0.035) than subjects with an AHI lower than 10 events/hour. In addition, a positive association exist between mean VV density and AHI (r = 0.445, p = 0.001) and CT90 (r = 0.399, p = 0.005). Finally, in the multiple linear regression analysis, female sex, fasting plasma glucose and AHI (but not CT90) were the only variables independently associated with the mean adventitial VV density (R2 = 0.327). In conclusion, a high VV density is present in obese subjects with SAHS, and chronic intermittent hypoxia is pointed as an independent risk factor for the development of this early step of atheromatous disease."
https://openalex.org/W2914159870,"To explore the use of automated planning in robotic radiosurgery of benign vestibular schwannoma (VS) tumors for dose reduction outside the planning target volume (PTV) to potentially reduce risk of secondary tumor induction.A system for automated planning (AUTOplans) for VS patients was set up. The goal of AUTO- planning was to reduce the dose bath, including the occurrence of high dose spikes leaking from the PTV into normal tissues, without worsening PTV coverage, OAR doses, or treatment time. For 20 VS patients treated with 1x12 Gy, the AUTOplan was compared with the plan generated with conventional, manual trial-and-error planning (MANplan).With equal PTV coverage, AUTOplans showed clinically negligible differences with MANplans in OAR sparing (largest mean difference for all OARs: ΔD2% = 0.2 Gy). AUTOplan dose distributions were more compact: mean/maximum reductions of 23.6/53.8% and 9.6/28.5% in patient volumes receiving more than 1 or 6 Gy, respectively (p<0.001). AUTOplans also showed smaller dose spikes with mean/maximum reductions of 22.8/37.2% and 14.2/40.4% in D2% for shells at 1 and 7 cm distance from the PTV, respectively (p<0.001).Automated planning for benign VS tumors highly outperformed manual planning with respect to the dose bath outside the PTV, without deteriorating PTV coverage or OAR sparing, or significantly increasing treatment time."
https://openalex.org/W2911600020,"Our objective was to examine how exercises with the second generation of the Microsoft Kinect sensor may aid in the process of motor learning in young judo practitioners. We addressed improvements in spatio-temporal accuracy during execution of three standing techniques in judo, in a simple paradigm designed to study short-term practice effects. Two groups of judokas, 12 athletes each—one aided with Kinect and our dedicated software vs a group of controls—were asked to mimic previously recorded master-level performances of the three techniques, established as benchmarks by a two times world champion in judo. In five training sessions, athletes of the aided group used a virtual-reality setup in which they trained with a virtual representation of the master displayed on a large screen with a simultaneous real-time visualisation of their own movements in the form of an avatar based on body joint localisation, as determined by Kinect, which also measured their performance. The control group used Kinect in the 1st and 5th session, which was necessary for the measurements that constituted the basis for subsequent statistical comparisons, whereas the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th session in this group was guided by a coach, without the use of the Kinect setup. In addition, athletes of the two groups had unrestricted access to a video recording of the master performing the three throws. We found statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) in the accuracy of executing the three techniques between the 1st and the 5th training session for the aided group but not for the control group. We conclude that incorporating Kinect based exercises into a judo training programme may be a useful means to supporting motor learning, therefore enhancing training efficiency, and thus improving performance."
https://openalex.org/W2911830778,"A hybrid topographic and numeric lymph node (LN) staging system for gastric cancer, which was recently proposed by Japanese experts as a simple method with a prognostic predictive power comparable to the N staging of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Tumor-node-metastasis classification, has not yet been validated in other Asian countries. This study aimed to examine the prognostic predictability of the hybrid staging system with the current AJCC staging system in gastric cancer.Overall, 400 patients with gastric cancer who underwent surgery at Changhua Christian Hospital from January 2007 to December 2017 were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for gastric cancer-related death. Homogeneity and discrimination abilities of the two staging systems were compared using likelihood ratio chi-square test, linear trend chi-square test, Harrell's c-index, and bootstrap analysis.One-third of the LN-positive patients were reclassified into the new N and Stage system. The concordance rates of the two staging systems and the N staging between the two staging systems were 0.810 and 0.729, respectively. Harrell's c-indices for the stage and N staging were higher in the 7th AJCC staging system than the hybrid staging system (c-index for stage, 0.771 vs 0.764; c-index for nodal stage, 0.713 vs 0.705). Stratification of the patients according to the histological grade revealed that Harrell's c-indices for the stage and N stage of the hybrid staging system were comparable with those of the 7th AJCC staging system (c-index for AJCC stage vs hybrid stage, 0.800 vs 0.791; c-index for AJCC N stage vs hybrid N stage, 0.746 vs 0.734) among patients with histologically lower grade gastric cancer. The performance of the new nodal staging system was better than that of the 7th AJCC staging system by likelihood ratio and linear trend tests and bootstrap analysis in the low-grade group.The hybrid anatomical location-based classification may have better prognostic predictive ability than the 7th AJCC staging system for LN metastasis of low-grade gastric cancer. Further studies involving different ethnic populations are necessary for the validation of the new staging system."
https://openalex.org/W2952118033,"Low-grade systemic inflammation is a predictor of recurrent cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Plasma proteins such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) have been shown to reflect basal as well as stress-induced inflammation in CAD. Measurements of MMP-9 and MPO in saliva might pose several advantages. Therefore, we investigated whether salivary levels of MMP-9 and MPO corresponded to plasma levels in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), both at rest and after acute physical exercise.A bicycle ergometer test was used as a model for stress-induced inflammation. Twenty-three CAD patients performed the test on two occasions 3-6 months apart. Whole unstimulated saliva was collected before, directly after and 30 min after exercise while plasma was collected before and after 30 min. MMP-9 and MPO in saliva and plasma were determined by Luminex.MMP-9 and MPO levels were 2- to 4-fold higher in saliva than in plasma. Amongst the saliva samples, and also to a great extent amongst the plasma samples, the levels of both types of protein showed strong intercorrelations between the levels at rest and after exercise during the two visits. However, there were no (or weak) correlations between salivary and plasma MMP-9 and none between salivary and plasma MPO.We conclude that salivary diagnostics cannot be used to assess systemic levels of MMP-9 and MPO in CAD patients, neither at rest nor after acute physical exercise."
