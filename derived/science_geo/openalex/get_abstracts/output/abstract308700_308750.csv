https://openalex.org/W2084732711,"DDT and its metabolites accumulate in organic plant detritus estuaries and may persist there for many years. The residues appear to be most abundantly associated with particulates having diameters from 250 to 1000 microns. Detritus particles of this size are ingested by many organisms, sociated DDT residues may enter diverse food chains. Fiddler crabs Uca were fed natural detritus containing DDT residues (10 parts per million) an 11-day experiment and showed grossly modified behavior associated threefold increase in concentration of DDT residues in the muscle of the large claw."

https://openalex.org/W2005822041,"Potassium-argon dates for three samples of basaltic scoria from Taylor Valley, on the west side of McMurdo Sound, indicate that the basalt, which antedates and postdates major glaciations, is at least 2.7 million years old."
https://openalex.org/W1625338370,"Archeological excavations at Murray Springs, Cochise County, Arizona, in July 1967 uncovered a unique bone tool in the Clovis occupation level and in association with bones of a mammoth. The tool may be a wrench for straightening shafts of spears; if so, shaft diameters ranging from 14 to 17 millimeters were most likely used in hafting Clovis projectile points."

The originally water-filled space between the grains is partially filled with calcium hydroxide crystals that appear to be responsible for the strength of the cement paste.
https://openalex.org/W1999755981,"A lower jaw of an eohippus (Hyracotherium cf. H. angustidens) from late Paleocene strata in Wyoming has extended the geological record of fossil horses into pre-Eocene time and suggests that the order Perissodactyla had an origin earlier than that heretofore conjectured. This specimen, together with equid teeth also possibly of late Paleocene age from Baja California, indicates that early perissodactyls were widespread on the North American continent before the Eocene epoch. Late Paleocene and early Eocene deposits of northwestern Wyoming have yielded many vertebrate rarities and ""first or earliest occurrences"" which require reappraisals of inter-and intracontinental dispersal patterns of the vertebrate groups involved."
https://openalex.org/W2037453006,"Through recent developments in instrumental analysis it is now possible to measure with good precision the rainwater concentrations of five short-lived radionuclides which are produced by cosmic ray spallation of atmospheric argon. These measurements provide a method for studying the in-cloud nucleation times and aerosol scavenging efficiencies, and promise to provide information onshort-term processes which occur in rain and snow formation."
https://openalex.org/W2008714728,"More than 25 atomic percent of aluminum can susbtitute for other cations in the structure of apatite [A(10)(XO(4)) (6)Z(2)]. Such a synthetic product was obtained by expelling volatile constituents (H(2)O and F) from morinite during thermal treatment. Infrared absorption spectra, chemical analysis, and x-ray powder diffraction demonstrate that the aluminum has two coordination numbers, and more than twice as much aluminum substitutes for calcium (A position) as for phosphorus (X position)."

https://openalex.org/W2080034528,"The major oxide composition of four silicate spherules from the area of forest devastated by the explosion of the Tunguska meteorite has been determined by electron microprobe analysis. In general, the spherules have compositions similar to that of igneous glass except for the low iron and the high calcium oxide content of the three spherules that have a low content of silicon dioxide. None of the spherules seem to have compositions similar to the silicate portiof any major meteorite group."

A redefinition embraces a larger range of solid solution, the end-member of which has the highest content of copper so far attributed to a member of the pyrite family."
