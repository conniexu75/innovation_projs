Two TPNH cytochrome c reductases, both flavoproteins, have been purified, one by Haas et al. (1) from yeast, and another by Horecker (2) from liver.’ Analogous enzymes in the case of DPNH have been implicated in particulate preparations (3) and crude extracts (4, 5), but our understanding of their nature and function is still fragmentary. The relationship between the pyridine nucleotide-cytochrome c reductases and the diaphorase discovered by von Euler et al. (6,7) and Green and Dewan (8), and isolated in purified form by Straub (9), remains obscure. This enzyme catalyzes the reoxidation of DPKH by dyes, such as methylene blue, but is incapable of interaction with cytochrome c, the physiological oxidant. This inability may be due to a structural modification of a native cytochrome c reductase (3, 10). On the basis of inhibiton studies, Slater (11) has concluded that a factor sensitive to BAL (2,3-dimercaptopropanol) is necessary for full reductase activity. More recently Potter and Reif (12) have implicated a similar factor, as a result of their studies on antimycin A inhibition. From this laboratory Hayaishi (13) has already reported on the preparation and assay of a soluble DPN cytochrome c reductase from pigeon breast muscle. This paper deals with an improved method for the preparation of this reductase."
https://openalex.org/W107618259,"Investigation of the protein compositions of highly purified preparation8 of eight strains of tobacco mosaic virus revealed that each strain possesses a characteristic composition which in several instances could be demonstrated to differ significantly from that of the other strains (1). The differences found consist mainly of altered proportions of certain amino acids, but it was also found that one of the strains, HR, contains two amino acids, histidine and methionine, apparently absent from the other strains examined, including common tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). It was concluded therefrom that mutation of tobacco mosaic virus can be accompanied by changes in the amino acid content of the virus. Since these strains of TMV are nucleoproteins, it is obvious that mutation in the virus might be associated with changes in the nucleic acid composition as well as with change8 in the protein composition. From previous results of phosphorus and pentose analyses (2), it would appear that all of the strains contain the same quantity and type of nucleic acid; namely, about 6 per cent of pentose nucleic acid. However, changes in the composition of the nucleic acid might occur during virus mutation without such change8 being reflected in the total amount of nucleic acid. In the present investigation, the molar proportions of the purine and pyrimidine bases in the nucleic acids were determined for the strains of tobacco mosaic virus on which the amino acid a88ays had previously been made. The results indicate that, with the exception of cucumber viruses 3 and 4, the strains contain the same proportions of purines and pyrimidines."

During the stage of active infection there is a retention of chloride in the body as manifested by a decreased chloride elimination, whereas the blood in this period shows a hypochloremia. The present study was designed to follow the changes in the concentration in the serum of the electrolytes in general and of the non-electrolytes in patients with lobar pneumonia. Hutchison (1898) studied the chloride metabolism in pneumonia and reviewed the literature up to 1898. He showed that diminution in the urinary chlorides might occur in other febrile conditions but was not as constant as in pneumonia and did not occur in other pulmonary diseases. For this reason he believed that an examination of the chlorides was of value in differentiating pneumonia from empyema, pleurisy, et cetera. Peabody (1913) studied the inorganic metabolism in pneumonia and reviewed the literature. In eight cases of pneumonia in which he studied the relation of chloride changes in the blood to changes in the urinary excretion he found that the decrease in the chloride excretion was associated with a lowered chloride concentration in the blood; and that at the time when excretion was increased, the blood chloride concentration was raised. His results also indicated a lowering of calcium and magnesium concentration of the blood during the stage of active infection."

https://openalex.org/W2172036558,"(Received for publication, December 12, 1961) The classification of amino acids as essential and non-essential resulted from feeding experiments with rats and dogs (1). Similar studies have been made with the chick (2) and with man (3). The results of these experiments have been consistent between the species with the exception of one or two amino acids. Ruminants apparently do not require “essential” amino acids in their food. Growing sheep have maintained a normal growth rate on a diet in which urea provided 50 per cent of the nitrogen (4). Urea has also been found to be a satisfactory protein substitute for lactating cows when furnishing 50 per cent of the dietary nitrogen (5). Ruminants fed a diet in which urea was the only nitrogen source continued to gain weight dur- ing the experimental period of more than 3 months (6). These results demonstrate that “essential” amino acids are being formed and it seems most plausible that the rumen microorganisms are responsible for this bio- synthesis. However, the possibility remains that, aside from microorgan- isms, ruminant tissues themselves may be able to synthesize amino acids that are dietarily essential for other species. Injecting CY4-labeled precursors into the blood of cows, we have obtained evidence that cow’s tissues synthesize appreciable quantities of only those amino acids that are non-essential for the dog and rat. Methods Lactating Jersey cows were injected intravenously in five separate trials with the following metabolites, each containing 5 mc. of C”: bicarbonate (XaHC140s), acetate (CH&Y400Na) and CY4H&OONa, propionate (CH3CH2CY400Na), and butyrate (CHaCHzCHzCY400Na). The tech- nique for administering the isotope has been described elsewhere (7). At 3 hours and 10 hours following the injection of the Cl4 metabolites, the cows were milked and the casein was isolated from each milk sample. *"

https://openalex.org/W8439666,n-Glutamic acid was consistently superior to a-ketoglutaratc in supporting the growth of Lactobacillus arabinosus 17-5 when these substances replaced L-glutamic acid in the medium (1). The results suggested that the conversion of n-glutamic to L-glutamic acid by this organism does not proceed chiefly through a-ketoglutaric acid. The present study demonstrates the presence of an enzymatic system in L. arabinosus which catalyzes the racemization of glutamic acid. Additional observations were also made which are relevant to the stimulation of utilization of n-glut.amic acid by glutamine previously reported (1). EXPERIMENTAL

https://openalex.org/W2135234668,"In order to extend previous studies carried out in this laboratory on the metabolism of purines and pyrimidines (l), bakers’ yeast was selected as a suitable material for metabolic tracer experiments because of its rapid growth and high ribose nucleic acid content. When these experiments were begun, the nature of the carbon precursors of the uric acid excreted by the pigeon (2, 3) and of the purines of the nucleic acids of the rat (1) had been established. In addition, the nitrogen of glycine had been shown to be a precursor of nitrogen 7 of uric acid in man (4), and of the yeast, Todopsis utilis (5). Recently bacteria have been shown to utilize glycine for purine synthesis (6). The role of preformed purines in the biosynthesis of the nucleic acid of the rat has been studied extensively by Brown and coworkers (7-9). Studies of this type have now been extended to yeast (10) by Kerr et al., who have shown both adenine and guanine to be utilized by Saccharomyces wrevisiae for nucleic acid synthesis. Knowledge of the biosynthesis of pyrimidines remains more limited. Heinrich and Wilson (1) showed that CO2 is the precursor of the ureide carbon of uracil and thymine. Neither formate nor glycine was observed to be incorporated into the pyrimidines of the nucleic acids of the rat in their experiments. LePage and Heidelberger (11) have also failed t,o find significant incorporation of glycine-2-Cl4 into pyrimidines. The methyl group of thymine has been shown to arise from the P-carbon of serine and the a-carbon of glycine by Elwyn and Sprinson (12). Totter et al. (13) have reported the incorporation of radioformate into thymine, and a partial degradation indicated that the radioactivity was very likely in the methyl carbon. That formate is necessarily the intermediate in the transfer of the P-carbon of serinc to the methyl group of thymine has been * E’rom the dissertation"
