https://openalex.org/W2060185417,"Protecting the Guts Regulatory T cells (T regs ) in the gut are important sentinels in maintaining the peace between our gut and its trillions of resident bacteria and have been shown to be regulated by specific strains of bacteria in mouse models. Smith et al. (p. 569 , published online 4 July; see the Perspective by Bollrath and Powrie ) asked whether metabolite(s) generated by resident bacterial species may regulate T regs in the gut. Indeed, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bacterial fermentation products of dietary fibers produced by a range of bacteria, restored colonic T reg numbers in mice devoid of a gut microbiota and increased T reg numbers in colonized mice. The effects of SCFAs on T regs were mediated through GPCR43, a receptor for SCFAs, which is expressed on colonic T regs . Mice fed SCFAs were protected against experimentally induced colitis in a manner that was dependent on GPR43-expressing T regs ."

Faith et al. (p. 10.1126/science.1237439 ) analyzed the fecal microbiota of 37 individuals and found that, on average, 60% of bacterial strains remained stable for up to 5 years and many were estimated to remain stable for decades."
https://openalex.org/W2152642144,"DNA methylation is implicated in mammalian brain development and plasticity underlying learning and memory. We report the genome-wide composition, patterning, cell specificity, and dynamics of DNA methylation at single-base resolution in human and mouse frontal cortex throughout their lifespan. Widespread methylome reconfiguration occurs during fetal to young adult development, coincident with synaptogenesis. During this period, highly conserved non-CG methylation (mCH) accumulates in neurons, but not glia, to become the dominant form of methylation in the human neuronal genome. Moreover, we found an mCH signature that identifies genes escaping X-chromosome inactivation. Last, whole-genome single-base resolution 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) maps revealed that hmC marks fetal brain cell genomes at putative regulatory regions that are CG-demethylated and activated in the adult brain and that CG demethylation at these hmC-poised loci depends on Tet2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1993251792,"The efficacy of therapeutics is dependent on a drug binding to its cognate target. Optimization of target engagement by drugs in cells is often challenging, because drug binding cannot be monitored inside cells. We have developed a method for evaluating drug binding to target proteins in cells and tissue samples. This cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) is based on the biophysical principle of ligand-induced thermal stabilization of target proteins. Using this assay, we validated drug binding for a set of important clinical targets and monitored processes of drug transport and activation, off-target effects and drug resistance in cancer cell lines, as well as drug distribution in tissues. CETSA is likely to become a valuable tool for the validation and optimization of drug target engagement."

https://openalex.org/W2152623715,"Understanding Xist-ance Large noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly appreciated to play important roles in the cell. A number of lncRNAs act to target chromatin regulatory complexes to their sites of action. Engreitz et al. (p. 10.1126/science.1237973 , published online 4 July; see the Perspective by Dimond and Fraser ) found that the mouse Xist lncRNA, which initiates X-chromosome inactivation, was transferred from its site of transcription to distant sites on the X chromosome purely through their close three-dimensional proximity to the Xist gene. Xist initially localized to the periphery of active genes on the X chromosome but gradually spread across them using its A-repeat domain, until the Xist RNA bound broadly across the inactive X chromosome in differentiated female cells."
https://openalex.org/W2121795427,"Mysterious Radio Bursts It has been uncertain whether single, short, and bright bursts of radio emission that have been observed are celestial or terrestrial in origin. Thornton et al. (p. 53 ; see the Perspective by Cordes ) report the detection of four nonrepeating radio transient events with millisecond duration in data from the 64-meter Parkes radio telescope in Australia. The properties of these radio bursts indicate that they had their origin outside our galaxy, but it is not possible to tell what caused them. Because the intergalactic medium affects the characteristics of the bursts, it will be possible to use them to study its properties."
https://openalex.org/W1964798793,"Landscapes generate a wide range of valuable ecosystem services, yet land-use decisions often ignore the value of these services. Using the example of the United Kingdom, we show the significance of land-use change not only for agricultural production but also for emissions and sequestration of greenhouse gases, open-access recreational visits, urban green space, and wild-species diversity. We use spatially explicit models in conjunction with valuation methods to estimate comparable economic values for these services, taking account of climate change impacts. We show that, although decisions that focus solely on agriculture reduce overall ecosystem service values, highly significant value increases can be obtained from targeted planning by incorporating all potential services and their values and that this approach also conserves wild-species diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2120967846,"MERS-CoV is a newly emerged coronavirus that is related to SARS-CoV and has proven fatal in half of the people it has infected to date: here the crystal structure of the MERS-CoV receptor binding domain is presented in complex with its receptor on human cells, CD26. By mid-July 2013, 90 cases of infection with the recently emerged SARS-like Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had been confirmed, including 43 fatalities. ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) acts as a cell surface receptor for the SARS coronavirus, but the functional receptor for MERS-CoV is dipeptidyl peptidase 4, also known as CD26. This paper presents the crystal structure of the receptor binding domain of MERS-CoV spike protein, both free and bound to the receptor. The structures reveal a core subdomain homologous to that of the SARS-CoV spike protein, and a unique strand-dominated external receptor binding motif that recognizes CD26. A suitably folded receptor binding domain may have potential as an immunogen for use in a MERS-CoV vaccine. The newly emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause severe pulmonary disease in humans1,2, representing the second example of a highly pathogenic coronavirus, the first being SARS-CoV3. CD26 (also known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4) was recently identified as the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV4. The engagement of the MERS-CoV spike protein with CD26 mediates viral attachment to host cells and virus–cell fusion, thereby initiating infection. Here we delineate the molecular basis of this specific interaction by presenting the first crystal structures of both the free receptor binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike protein and its complex with CD26. Furthermore, binding between the RBD and CD26 is measured using real-time surface plasmon resonance with a dissociation constant of 16.7 nM. The viral RBD is composed of a core subdomain homologous to that of the SARS-CoV spike protein, and a unique strand-dominated external receptor binding motif that recognizes blades IV and V of the CD26 β-propeller. The atomic details at the interface between the two binding entities reveal a surprising protein–protein contact mediated mainly by hydrophilic residues. Sequence alignment indicates, among betacoronaviruses, a possible structural conservation for the region homologous to the MERS-CoV RBD core, but a high variation in the external receptor binding motif region for virus-specific pathogenesis such as receptor recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1979058918,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent hematopoietic progenitors (MPPs) are routinely isolated using various markers but remain heterogeneous. Here we show that four SLAM family markers, CD150, CD48, CD229, and CD244, can distinguish HSCs and MPPs from restricted progenitors and subdivide them into a hierarchy of functionally distinct subpopulations with stepwise changes in cell-cycle status, self-renewal, and reconstituting potential. CD229 expression largely distinguished lymphoid-biased HSCs from rarely dividing myeloid-biased HSCs, enabling prospective enrichment of these HSC subsets. Differences in CD229 and CD244 expression resolved CD150−CD48−/lowLineage−/lowSca-1+c-Kit+ cells into a hierarchy of highly purified MPPs that retained erythroid and platelet potential but exhibited progressive changes in mitotic activity and reconstituting potential. Use of these markers, and reconstitution assays, showed that conditional deletion of Scf from endothelial cells and perivascular stromal cells eliminated the vast majority of bone marrow HSCs, including nearly all CD229−/low HSCs, demonstrating that quiescent HSCs are maintained by a perivascular niche."

We introduce Ub chain restriction analysis, in which OTU DUBs are used as restriction enzymes to reveal linkage type and the relative abundance of Ub chains on substrates. Protein ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification of mostly Lys residues that regulates many cellular processes, including protein degradation, intracellular trafficking, cell signaling, autophagy, transcription, translation, and the DNA damage response (Komander and Rape, 2012Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). This functional diversity is achieved by the ability of ubiquitin (Ub) to form topologically distinct signals. Proteins can be monoubiquitinated at one or multiple sites or polyubiquitinated by modification with Ub chains. Within Ub chains, linkages can be formed via seven Ub Lys residues or via the N-terminal Met1, generating homotypic (one linkage type per polymer) or heterotypic (multiple linkage types per polymer) Ub chains (Komander and Rape, 2012Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). Differently linked Ub polymers have distinct cellular functions. Lys48-linked Ub chains serve as a proteasomal degradation signal (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6880) Google Scholar), whereas Lys63-linked chains are nondegradative and, for example, activate protein kinase cascades (Chen and Sun, 2009Chen Z.J. Sun L.J. Nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin in cell signaling.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Lys11 linkages constitute an alternative degradation signal used during cell-cycle progression (Wickliffe et al., 2011Wickliffe K.E. Williamson A. Meyer H.-J. Kelly A. Rape M. K11-linked ubiquitin chains as novel regulators of cell division.Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 656-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Met1-linked chains cooperate with Lys63 linkages in NF-κB signaling (Iwai, 2011Iwai K. Linear polyubiquitin chains: a new modifier involved in NFκB activation and chronic inflammation, including dermatitis.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the remaining four Ub chain types (Lys6, Lys27, Lys29, and Lys33), cellular roles are elusive (Kulathu and Komander, 2012Kulathu Y. Komander D. Atypical ubiquitylation - the unexplored world of polyubiquitin beyond Lys48 and Lys63 linkages.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 508-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Deubiquitinases (DUBs) remove Ub modifications and regulate virtually all Ub-dependent processes (Komander et al., 2009Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S.

Many of the ∼80 DUBs that are predicted to be active in human cells have been implicated in human diseases such as neurodegeneration, inflammation, infection, and cancer (Clague et al., 2012Clague M.J. Coulson J.M. Urbé S. Cellular functions of the DUBs.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).

Sicheri F. et al.Non-canonical inhibition of DNA damage-dependent ubiquitination by OTUB1.Nature. 2010; 466: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Because of the complexity of the Ub modification, DUBs must display various layers of specificity—they must distinguish not only between Ub and Ub-like modifications but also between the eight Ub linkage types. Moreover, chain topology and length may also affect DUB activity (Komander et al., 2009Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The extent to which DUBs are linkage specific is not clear. Characterized Ub-specific protease (USP) family DUBs are not linkage specific (Faesen et al., 2011Faesen A.C. Luna-Vargas M.P.A. Geurink P.P. Clerici M. Merkx R. van Dijk W.J. Hameed D.S.

Biol. 2011; 18: 1550-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast, OTU family DUBs can be linkage specific. OTUB1 prefers Lys48 linkages (Edelmann et al., 2009Edelmann M.J. Iphöfer A. Akutsu M. Altun M. di Gleria K. Kramer H.B. Fiebiger E. Dhe-Paganon S. Kessler B.M.

Biol. 2010; 17: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), TRABID is Lys29 and Lys33 specific (Licchesi et al., 2012Licchesi J.D.F. Mieszczanek J. Mevissen T.E.T. Rutherford T.J. Akutsu M. Virdee S. El Oualid F. Chin J.W. Ovaa H. Bienz M. Komander D. An ankyrin-repeat ubiquitin-binding domain determines TRABID’s specificity for atypical ubiquitin chains.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 62-71Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and OTULIN is Met1 specific (Keusekotten et al., 2013Keusekotten K. Elliott P.R. Glockner L. Fiil B.K. Damgaard R.B. Kulathu Y. Wauer T. Gyrd-Hansen M. Krappmann D. Hofmann K. et al.OTULIN Antagonizes LUBAC Signaling by Specifically Hydrolyzing Met1-Linked Polyubiquitin.Cell. 2013; 153: 1312-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, with the exception of TRABID and OTULIN, comprehensive analyses comparing all chain types have not been performed. Here, we provide a biochemical characterization of all 16 human OTU DUBs that contain a complete catalytic triad and analyze their cross-reactivity against Ub-like molecules, catalytic activity, and linkage specificity. Most OTU DUBs show intrinsic linkage specificity, preferring one or a small defined subset of Ub linkage types. Mechanistic and structural studies of three closely related, unstudied OTUs with distinct cleavage profiles revealed four mechanisms for achieving linkage specificity, namely (1) the use of additional Ub-binding domains (UBDs), (2) specific recognition of a ubiquitinated sequence, (3) the use of a conserved S1’ Ub-binding site on the OTU domain itself, and (4) the use of an S2 site enabling DUBs to bind longer chains in a linkage-specific manner. The linkage specificity in OTU DUBs can be exploited in Ub chain restriction analysis, whereby linkage-specific DUBs are used to identify the linkage type(s) on a ubiquitinated protein. In the human genome, OTU domains exist in at least 18 genes, 14 of which have been annotated as active DUBs (Komander et al., 2009Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). In addition to these, OTULIN/FAM105B (Keusekotten et al., 2013Keusekotten K. Elliott P.R. Glockner L. Fiil B.K. Damgaard R.B. Kulathu Y. Wauer T. Gyrd-Hansen M. Krappmann D. Hofmann K. et al.OTULIN Antagonizes LUBAC Signaling by Specifically Hydrolyzing Met1-Linked Polyubiquitin.Cell. 2013; 153: 1312-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and ALG13 (UniProt Q9NP73) have recently been described or annotated as additional OTU domains with a complete catalytic triad. FAM105A (UniProt Q9NUU6) contains an OTULIN-like OTU domain but lacks catalytic triad residues. HIN1L is a pseudogene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/360227). Phylogenetic analysis delineates four subfamilies: the OTUB subfamily/Otubains (OTUB1 and OTUB2), the OTUD subfamily (OTUD1, OTUD2/YOD1, OTUD3, OTUD4, OTUD5/DUBA, OTUD6A, OTUD6B, ALG13, and HIN1L), the A20-like subfamily (A20, Cezanne, Cezanne2, TRABID, and VCPIP), and the OTULIN subfamily (OTULIN and FAM105A) (Figure 1A). The size of the catalytic domain distinguishes subfamilies—OTUD enzymes being the smallest (∼150 amino acids [aa]), and the OTUB/OTULIN (220–270 aa) and A20-like OTUs (300–350 aa) containing larger catalytic folds. Most human OTUs contain additional domains, including UBDs (Figure 1B). We cloned the 16 catalytic-triad-containing human OTU DUBs from plasmids, IMAGE clones, or human complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries and expressed and purified full-length (FL) and/or OTU domain-containing constructs in E. coli (Figures 1C and 1D). Most OTUs reacted quantitatively with Ub propargylamide (Ub-PA) (Ekkebus et al., 2013Ekkebus R. van Kasteren S.I. Kulathu Y. Scholten A. Berlin I. Geurink P.P. de Jong A. Goerdayal S. Neefjes J. Heck A.J.R. et al.On terminal alkynes that can react with active-site cysteine nucleophiles in proteases.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135: 2867-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), indicating proper folding and a reactive catalytic Cys (Figure 1E, Figure S1A available online). OTUD5/DUBA required activation by phosphorylation in the OTU domain by recombinant CK2 to display reactivity (Huang et al., 2012Huang O.W. Ma X. Yin J. Flinders J. Maurer T. Kayagaki N. Phung Q. Bosanac I. Arnott D. Dixit V.M. et al.Phosphorylation-dependent activity of the deubiquitinase DUBA.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). OTULIN did not react with Ub-PA because it requires activation by a proximal Ub for activity (Keusekotten et al., 2013Keusekotten K. Elliott P.R. Glockner L. Fiil B.K. Damgaard R.B. Kulathu Y. Wauer T. Gyrd-Hansen M. Krappmann D.

ALG13 did not react with Ub-PA, but it did react with haloalkyl probes, and A20 reacted very slowly and incompletely with all tested probes (Figures 1E, S1A, and S1B). The C terminus of Ub is important for DUB reactivity (Drag et al., 2008Drag M. Mikolajczyk J. Békés M. Reyes-Turcu F.E. Ellman J.A. Wilkinson K.D. Salvesen G.S. Positional-scanning fluorigenic substrate libraries reveal unexpected specificity determinants of DUBs (deubiquitinating enzymes).Biochem. J. 2008; 415: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Ub-like modifiers ISG15 and NEDD8 have identical or similar C-terminal sequences, and whereas OTUB1 is Ub specific (Edelmann et al., 2009Edelmann M.J. Iphöfer A. Akutsu M. Altun M. di Gleria K. Kramer H.B. Fiebiger E. Dhe-Paganon S. Kessler B.M. Structural basis and specificity of human otubain 1-mediated deubiquitination.Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), viral OTU domains (vOTU) can be cross-reactive for Ub and ISG15 (Frias-Staheli et al., 2007Frias-Staheli N. Giannakopoulos N.V. Kikkert M. Taylor S.L. Bridgen A. Paragas J. Richt J.A. Rowland R.R. Schmaljohn C.S.

We found that ISG15-based suicide probes that modified vOTU (Akutsu et al., 2011Akutsu M. Ye Y. Virdee S. Chin J.W. Komander D. Molecular basis for ubiquitin and ISG15 cross-reactivity in viral ovarian tumor domains.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 2228-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) did not react with human OTU DUBs (Figure S1C). In contrast, 13 of the 16 human OTU DUBs were modified by NEDD8-derived suicide probes to varying degrees (Figure S1D). However, comparing Ub- and NEDD8-based peptide substrates in fluorescence polarization assays (Geurink et al., 2012Geurink P.P. El Oualid F. Jonker A. Hameed D.S. Ovaa H. A general chemical ligation approach towards isopeptide-linked ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like assay reagents.ChemBioChem. 2012; 13: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (see below) showed that OTU DUBs only hydrolyzed the Ub-based, but not the NEDD8-based, substrates under identical conditions (Figure S1E), indicating that human OTU DUBs are Ub specific. Next, we analyzed the linkage specificity of human OTU DUBs against all eight types of diubiquitin (diUb) (Figure 2A). Time-course experiments were performed at constant substrate concentration. Enzymes were used at different concentrations in order to identify the lowest DUB concentration that resulted in significant cleavage of the preferred chain type(s), indicating linkage preference of the DUB. The results of this analysis revealed a striking and unexpected linkage specificity of all human OTU DUBs (Figure 2A). Six DUBs (Cezanne, Cezanne2 – Lys11; OTUD4, OTUB1 – Lys48; OTUD1 – Lys63; OTULIN – Met1) cleaved only one diUb substrate (group I), four DUBs (OTUD3 – Lys6 and Lys11; A20, VCPIP – Lys11 and Lys48; phosphorylated OTUD5 – Lys48 and Lys63) cleaved two substrates (group II), and four DUBs (OTUD2, OTUD6A, OTUB2, TRABID) cleaved three or more chains preferentially (group III) (Figures 2A and 2B). ALG13, unphosphorylated OTUD5, and OTUD6B were inactive in this assay (group IV) despite being modified by Ub suicide probes (Figures 1E, S1A, and S1B). Increasing the concentration of DUB in the assay or using longer incubation times led to the hydrolysis of linkages other than the preferred linkage types (Figure S2). With the exception of OTULIN, no tested DUB hydrolyzed Met1 linkages even at a higher enzyme concentration or later time points (Keusekotten et al., 2013Keusekotten K. Elliott P.R. Glockner L.

The OTU DUB cleavage profiles differed from USP domain DUBs that cleave all types of diUb with similar activity (Faesen et al., 2011Faesen A.C. Luna-Vargas M.P.A. Geurink P.P. Clerici M. Merkx R. van Dijk W.J. Hameed D.S. El Oualid F. Ovaa H. Sixma T.K. The differential modulation of USP activity by internal regulatory domains, interactors and eight ubiquitin chain types.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 1550-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It was unclear whether OTU orthologs have conserved their linkage preference throughout evolution. S. cerevisiae encode only two OTU DUBs, yOtu1 and yOtu2. yOtu1 and D. melanogaster (dm) Otu1 are orthologs of human OTUD2 (38% and 53% identical in OTU domain, respectively), and OTUD2 and yOtu1 both bind cdc48/p97 and are involved in endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (Ernst et al., 2009Ernst R. Mueller B. Ploegh H.L. Schlieker C. The otubain YOD1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that associates with p97 to facilitate protein dislocation from the ER.Mol.

Functional division of substrate processing cofactors of the ubiquitin-selective Cdc48 chaperone.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). OTUD2 and yOtu1 preferred the same atypical linkages (Figures 2A and S2D), whereas dmOtu1 also cleaved Lys6 linkages, indicating that the linkage profiles of OTU enzymes are not necessarily identical in different species (Figure S2E). Altogether, this revealed that the OTU family had evolved enzymes that recognize and hydrolyze specific Ub chain types. Distinct Ub linkage specificity in members from a single DUB family was unexpected and required a mechanistic explanation. During the hydrolysis of diUb, both Ub moieties interact with the DUB’s catalytic domain (Figure 3A). The distal Ub moiety binds to the enzymatic S1 site and positions its C-terminal tail in the catalytic site. This distal Ub is identical in each diUb molecule and does not explain linkage specificity. In contrast, the proximal Ub moiety that binds to the enzymatic S1’ site contributes the Lys to the isopeptide bond. Hence, mechanisms to position and orient the proximal Ub moiety are the key to understand linkage specificity in DUBs. We selected three members of the OTUD family for additional investigation: the unstudied Lys63-specific OTUD1, the cdc48/p97 interactor OTUD2 that cleaves atypical linkages (Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, and Lys33), and OTUD3, another unstudied DUB with activity against Lys6- and Lys11-linked diUb (Figure 2A). First, we tested whether UBDs in OTUDs contribute to positioning the proximal Ub toward the catalytic center. OTUD1 contains a C-terminal Ub-interacting motif (UIM, aa 457–476), OTUD2 contains an UBX-like domain (aa 46–128) and a C-terminal zinc finger (ZnF, aa 318–342), and OTUD3 contains a C-terminal Ub-associated domain (UBA, aa 230–270). We compared the activity and linkage specificity for truncated OTUD enzymes (Figure 3). The removal of the OTUD1 UIM had dramatic effects on activity and linkage specificity. Full-length OTUD1 or a construct comprising OTU and UIM were highly active and Lys63 specific (Figures 2A and 3B). The removal of the UIM in the OTU-only construct rendered the protein less active (assay performed at a 14.5× higher enzyme concentration) and, importantly, nonspecific (Figure 3B). Hence, in OTUD1, the UIM greatly increased the specificity and efficiency of the enzyme toward Lys63 linkages. This is similar to TRABID, where an N-terminal ankyrin-repeat Ub-binding domain is required for Lys29 and Lys33 linkage specificity (Licchesi et al., 2012Licchesi J.D.F. Mieszczanek J. Mevissen T.E.T. Rutherford T.J. Akutsu M. Virdee S. El Oualid F. Chin J.W. Ovaa H. Bienz M. Komander D. An ankyrin-repeat ubiquitin-binding domain determines TRABID’s specificity for atypical ubiquitin chains.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 62-71Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Full-length OTUD2 cleaved Lys11-, Lys27-, Lys29-, and Lys33-linked diUb (Figure 2A). Removal of the N-terminal UBX-like domain did not affect OTUD2 specificity, but deletion of the C-terminal ZnF domain or point mutations in zinc-binding residues significantly reduced activity toward Lys27-, Lys29-, and Lys33-linked diUb without affecting Lys11 activity (Figure 3C). The same was observed in dmOtu1 (Figure S3A). Hence, the ZnF domain in OTUD2 enabled a Lys11-specific catalytic core domain to cleave three additional linkage types. This suggested that the OTUD2 ZnF is a UBD; however, we were unable to detect an interaction with monoUb in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift perturbation experiments (Figures S3B–S3E). UBDs do not always influence linkage specificity, at least for diUb substrates, as shown for OTUD3, where the removal of the UBA domain did not change its ability to cleave Lys6- and Lys11-linked diUb (Figure 3D). Hence, additional domains can both restrict and broaden the linkage specificity profile of OTU DUBs and fulfill important roles in regulating OTU activity and linkage specificity (Figure 3E). Notably, 8 of the 16 human OTU DUBs contain UBDs (Figure 1B), suggesting that this could be a widely used mechanism. Moreover, UBDs in DUBs of other families (USPs and Josephins) could have similar roles. Isolated catalytic OTU domains showed distinct linkage specificity against diUb substrates (Figures 3B–3D), and, next, we investigated whether the entire proximal Ub or only the sequence surrounding the ubiquitinated Lys was important for linkage specificity. For this, fluorescent ubiquitinated 14-mer peptides derived from Ub (Figure 4A) (Geurink et al., 2012Geurink P.P. El Oualid F. Jonker A. Hameed D.S. Ovaa H. A general chemical ligation approach towards isopeptide-linked ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like assay reagents.ChemBioChem. 2012; 13: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), as well as a minimal fluorescent Lys-Gly (KG) peptide, were used in fluorescence anisotropy assays at fixed substrate and increasing OTU DUB concentrations (Figures 4 and S4).Figure S4Additional Fluorescence Polarization Assays and Ala Scan of the K11 Peptide, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A and B) Fluorescence polarization assays as in Figure 4B–4D for OTUB1 (A) and Cezanne2 (B).(C and D) Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the K11 peptide.(C) Sequences of mutated fluorescent DUB substrates.(D) Bar graph representation of graphs shown in Figure 4F.

Error bars represent SD from the mean. In the majority of OTU DUBs tested, the peptide probes did not reflect the linkage specificity seen with diUb. OTUD1, OTUD3, OTUB1, and Cezanne2 hydrolyzed most or all peptide substrates (Figures 4B, 4C, S4A, and S4B), albeit with reduced activity for some combinations (e.g., OTUD1 against K33 peptide, Figure 4B). This suggested that the recognition of the entire proximal Ub fold is required for the linkage specificity of these DUBs, which was consistent with the involvement of, for example, UBDs (Figure 3). In contrast, and to our surprise, OTUD2 displayed a marked specificity for the peptide that was derived from the Lys11 sequence of Ub (K11 peptide, Figures 4D and 4E). OTUD2 hydrolyzed all peptide substrates at a high enzyme concentration but had already completely hydrolyzed the K11 peptide at the start of the measurement (Figure 4D). Dilution of OTUD2 to picomolar concentrations recovered complete specificity of the DUB against the K11 peptide, and even the similar K6 peptide was not hydrolyzed significantly at low enzyme concentrations (Figure 4E). To further understand this, we mutated each amino acid of the ubiquitinated K11 peptide to Ala (Figure S4C). The K6A peptide was insoluble, and Gly10 was not mutated. Experiments performed at an OTUD2 concentration that cleaved the K11 peptide revealed that Ala substitutions of Phe4, Val5, Thr7, Leu8, Thr12, Ile13, and Leu15 significantly reduced the hydrolysis activity of the peptide (Figures 4F and S4D). Several of these residues are solvent exposed in Ub, suggesting that OTUD2 binds to these residues of the proximal Ub. However, Ile13 and Leu15 are not exposed in folded Ub and, hence, are unlikely to play a role in diUb recognition. Nonetheless, this revealed another mechanism of OTU DUB linkage specificity whereby OTUD2 selected the sequence context of a ubiquitinated substrate, in this case recognizing the Ub sequence surrounding Lys11 (Figure 4G). To understand the specificity of OTUD domains at the molecular level, we determined high-resolution crystal structures of OTUD1 (aa 287–437, 2.1 Å, Figures 5A and S5A), OTUD2 (aa 132–314, 1.5 Å, Figures 5B and S5B), and OTUD3 (aa 52–209, 1.55 Å, Figures 5C and S5C) (Table S1). The catalytic domains are structurally similar to each other and to OTUD5 (Huang et al., 2012Huang O.W. Ma X. Yin J. Flinders J. Maurer T. Kayagaki N. Phung Q. Bosanac I. Arnott D.

Here we find miR-22 triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhances invasiveness and promotes metastasis in mouse xenografts. In a conditional mammary gland-specific transgenic (TG) mouse model, we show that miR-22 enhances mammary gland side-branching, expands the stem cell compartment, and promotes tumor development. Critically, miR-22 promotes aggressive metastatic disease in MMTV-miR-22 TG mice, as well as compound MMTV-neu or -PyVT-miR-22 TG mice. We demonstrate that miR-22 exerts its metastatic potential by silencing antimetastatic miR-200 through direct targeting of the TET (Ten eleven translocation) family of methylcytosine dioxygenases, thereby inhibiting demethylation of the mir-200 promoter. Finally, we show that miR-22 overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and silencing of the TET-miR-200 axis in patients. Taken together, our findings implicate miR-22 as a crucial epigenetic modifier and promoter of EMT and breast cancer stemness toward metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1975857445,"For acutely lethal influenza infections, the relative pathogenic contributions of direct viral damage to lung epithelium versus dysregulated immunity remain unresolved. Here, we take a top-down systems approach to this question. Multigene transcriptional signatures from infected lungs suggested that elevated activation of inflammatory signaling networks distinguished lethal from sublethal infections. Flow cytometry and gene expression analysis involving isolated cell subpopulations from infected lungs showed that neutrophil influx largely accounted for the predictive transcriptional signature. Automated imaging analysis, together with these gene expression and flow data, identified a chemokine-driven feedforward circuit involving proinflammatory neutrophils potently driven by poorly contained lethal viruses. Consistent with these data, attenuation, but not ablation, of the neutrophil-driven response increased survival without changing viral spread. These findings establish the primacy of damaging innate inflammation in at least some forms of influenza-induced lethality and provide a roadmap for the systematic dissection of infection-associated pathology."

By stopping a light pulse in an atomic ensemble contained inside an optical resonator, we realize a device in which one stored gate photon controls the resonator transmission of subsequently applied source photons. A weak gate pulse induces bimodal transmission distribution, corresponding to zero and one gate photons. One stored gate photon produces fivefold source attenuation, and can be retrieved from the atomic ensemble after switching more than one source photon. Without retrieval, one stored gate photon can switch several hundred source photons. With improved storage and retrieval efficiency, our work may enable various new applications, including photonic quantum gates, and deterministic multiphoton entanglement."
https://openalex.org/W2053930062,"MicroRNAs are frequently deregulated in cancer. Here we show that miR-22 is upregulated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia and its aberrant expression correlates with poor survival. To explore its role in hematopoietic stem cell function and malignancy, we generated transgenic mice conditionally expressing miR-22 in the hematopoietic compartment. These mice displayed reduced levels of global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and increased hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal accompanied by defective differentiation. Conversely, miR-22 inhibition blocked proliferation in both mouse and human leukemic cells. Over time, miR-22 transgenic mice developed MDS and hematological malignancies. We also identify TET2 as a key target of miR-22 in this context. Ectopic expression of TET2 suppressed the miR-22-induced phenotypes. Downregulation of TET2 protein also correlated with poor clinical outcomes and miR-22 overexpression in MDS patients. Our results therefore identify miR-22 as a potent proto-oncogene and suggest that aberrations in the miR-22/TET2 regulatory network are common in hematopoietic malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2009301533,"Apical constriction promotes epithelia folding, which changes tissue architecture. During Drosophila gastrulation, mesoderm cells exhibit repeated contractile pulses that are stabilized such that cells apically constrict like a ratchet. The transcription factor Twist is required to stabilize cell shape. However, it is unknown how Twist spatially coordinates downstream signals to prevent cell relaxation. We find that during constriction, Rho-associated kinase (Rok) is polarized to the middle of the apical domain (medioapical cortex), separate from adherens junctions. Rok recruits or stabilizes medioapical myosin II (Myo-II), which contracts dynamic medioapical actin cables. The formin Diaphanous mediates apical actin assembly to suppress medioapical E-cadherin localization and form stable connections between the medioapical contractile network and adherens junctions. Twist is not required for apical Rok recruitment, but instead polarizes Rok medioapically. Therefore, Twist establishes radial cell polarity of Rok/Myo-II and E-cadherin and promotes medioapical actin assembly in mesoderm cells to stabilize cell shape fluctuations."

To elucidate their involvement during influenza infection, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry lipidomic profiling of 141 lipid species was performed on a mouse influenza model using two viruses of significantly different pathogenicity. Infection by the low-pathogenicity strain X31/H3N2 induced a proinflammatory response followed by a distinct anti-inflammatory response; infection by the high-pathogenicity strain PR8/H1N1 resulted in overlapping pro- and anti-inflammatory states. Integration of the large-scale lipid measurements with targeted gene expression data demonstrated that 5-lipoxygenase metabolites correlated with the pathogenic phase of the infection, whereas 12/15-lipoxygenase metabolites were associated with the resolution phase. Hydroxylated linoleic acid, specifically the ratio of 13- to 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, was identified as a potential biomarker for immune status during an active infection.

We obtained a genome-wide view of cis-regulatory evolution in human embryonic tissues by comparing the histone modification H3K27ac, which provides a quantitative readout of promoter and enhancer activity, during human, rhesus, and mouse limb development. Based on increased H3K27ac, we find that 13% of promoters and 11% of enhancers have gained activity on the human lineage since the human-rhesus divergence. These gains largely arose by modification of ancestral regulatory activities in the limb or potential co-option from other tissues and are likely to have heterogeneous genetic causes. Most enhancers that exhibit gain of activity in humans originated in mammals. Gains at promoters and enhancers in the human limb are associated with increased gene expression, suggesting they include molecular drivers of human morphological evolution."

In metazoans, cell surface and secreted proteins play essential roles in intercellular communication, cellular adhesion, and developmentally important signaling pathways by binding to other proteins in the extracellular milieu (Ben-Shlomo et al., 2003Ben-Shlomo I.

Consequently, cell surface and secreted proteins comprise a substantial fraction of the human proteome (Almén et al., 2009Almén M.S. Nordström K.J.V. Fredriksson R. Schiöth H.B.

Although vast amounts of protein interactome data have been generated in the last decade, extracellular and transmembrane proteins are greatly underrepresented in these data sets, due to the technical challenges that extracellular proteins present for systems biology and proteomics approaches (Wright et al., 2010Wright G.J. Martin S. Bushell K.M. Söllner C. High-throughput identification of transient extracellular protein interactions.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 919-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Producing extracellular molecules requires special conditions enabled by secretion, such as an oxidizing environment (for disulfide bonds) and specific posttranslational modifications (predominantly glycosylation) for folding and function. Methods that target proteins to intracellular compartments, such as the nucleus in yeast two hybrid (Y2H), are unlikely to allow functional folding of most extracellular proteins. Furthermore, low-affinity interactions (i.e., KD ∼μM), which are difficult to detect, are known to dominate the extracellular interactome (van der Merwe and Barclay, 1994van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Transient intercellular adhesion: the importance of weak protein-protein interactions.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 354-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Moreover, because many extracellular proteins contain transmembrane regions, affinity pull-downs and mass spectrometric methods tend to miss or misassign interactions as a consequence of the presence of the plasma membrane and/or detergents nonspecifically subsuming hydrophobic, “sticky” and nearest neighbor interactions. For these reasons, there is a deficiency of reliable global interaction data for extracellular proteins. The lack of reliable interaction data for transmembrane and extracellular proteins has been previously noted in large protein interactome studies and databases (Braun et al., 2009Braun P. Tasan M.

Also, a recent affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP-MS)-based interactome, the Drosophila Protein Interaction Mapping (DPiM) project, underrepresents every one of the six extracellular and transmembrane protein classifications. These include cell adhesion molecules, cell junction proteins, defense/immunity proteins-IgSF family, extracellular matrix proteins, receptors, signaling molecules, and transmembrane proteins. By contrast, only one intracellular category out of the remaining 21 was underrepresented (Guruharsha et al., 2011Guruharsha K.G. Rual J.-F. Zhai B. Mintseris J. Vaidya P. Vaidya N. Beekman C.

To address these problems, recent work has focused on the development of eukaryotic expression systems that use oligomerization to identify and assess low-affinity interactions between extracellular proteins. Clustering of ligands in various formats was found to be necessary for detecting interactions between Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) splice variants (Wojtowicz et al., 2007Wojtowicz W.M.

In the present study, we utilize a high-throughput oligomerization-based methodology for detecting extracellular interactions between individually expressed recombinant ECDs in Drosophila melanogaster, which offers the advantage of rapid and robust functional tools to assess function. We applied these methods to nearly all the members of the IgSF, FnIII, and LRR families of the Drosophila melanogaster extracellular proteome. We expressed 202 proteins and evaluated a total of 20,503 unique pairwise interactions. We found 106 protein pairs that displayed detectable interactions, of which 83 (78%) are previously unknown. We confirmed several of these interactions using quantitative biophysical methods and demonstrated that previous large-scale interactomes had failed to detect these interactions. We elucidated interactions among known signaling pathways and discovered that a 20 member IgSF subfamily of unknown function, the Dprs, interacts with an 11 member subfamily, also of unknown function. We demonstrated that these protein-protein interactions can be visualized in vivo by using oligomerized fusion proteins to stain live-dissected Drosophila embryos. We found that Dprs and their binding partners label specific subsets of cells within the central nervous system (CNS). For one Dpr-ligand pair, we used loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) genetics to demonstrate that ligand-receptor interactions discovered in vitro also occur in live embryos. Collectively, this study provides a framework with which to identify bona fide receptor-ligand partners, which can then be functionally defined in vivo during development using genetic methodologies. The eventual extension of this approach to the entire Drosophila extracellular proteome will facilitate an understanding of the mechanisms through which these classes of proteins influence development and function. The IgSF is the most highly represented extracellular protein domain in humans (∼3% of human protein-coding genes). Among all large protein domain families, the numbers of IgSF domains encoded in a genome correlate the most with organismal complexity (Vogel and Chothia, 2006Vogel C. Chothia C. Protein family expansions and biological complexity.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e48Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). IgSF proteins are essential for intercellular communication during development of organ systems (Williams and Barclay, 1988Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. The immunoglobulin superfamily—domains for cell surface recognition.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, they are required for cell migration, axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity (Yamagata et al., 2003Yamagata M. Sanes J.R. Weiner J.A. Synaptic adhesion molecules.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In the immune system, IgSF proteins are involved in many cell communication, migration, and signaling events and in molecular recognition of self versus nonself (Pålsson-McDermott and O’Neill, 2007Pålsson-McDermott E.M. O’Neill L.A.J. Building an immune system from nine domains.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). IgSF proteins are known to engage other IgSF proteins in homophilic and heterophilic complexes that mediate distinct functionalities, such as formation of adhesion structures, but as yet there has been no experimental cataloging of all IgSF protein interactions from any species. FnIII domains are structurally and functionally related to the IgSF fold, as both are composed of β sheet sandwiches, and they often coexist within the same protein. LRR proteins constitute another prominent extracellular family heavily utilized in the nervous and innate immune systems (Dolan et al., 2007Dolan J. Walshe K. Alsbury S. Hokamp K. O’Keeffe S. Okafuji T. Miller S.F.C. Tear G. Mitchell K.J. The extracellular leucine-rich repeat superfamily; a comparative survey and analysis of evolutionary relationships and expression patterns.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 320Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). They have been found to be receptors for developmentally important signals in both Drosophila and vertebrates (Dolan et al., 2007Dolan J. Walshe K. Alsbury S. Hokamp K. O’Keeffe S. Okafuji T. Miller S.F.C. Tear G. Mitchell K.J.

The Drosophila Toll signaling pathway.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In the Drosophila nervous system, LRRs mediate cell recognition events required for target selection by motor neurons and olfactory neurons (Hong et al., 2009Hong W. Zhu H. Potter C.J. Barsh G.

Because of the pervasive nature of IgSF, FnIII, and LRR proteins, we chose to focus our interactome on these three domain types. Furthermore, a large number of these genes are not annotated, the majority of them have not been studied, and only a small percentage have known protein interactors, so efforts to deorphanize them could fill this void and likely yield interactions that are functionally important. Previous efforts have been made to identify and annotate extracellular IgSF and LRR family proteins of Drosophila melanogaster (Dolan et al., 2007Dolan J. Walshe K. Alsbury S. Hokamp K. O’Keeffe S.

The immunoglobulin superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans and the evolution of complexity.Development. 2003; 130: 6317-6328Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We further searched the fly genome for proteins containing extracellular IgSF, FnIII, and LRR domains (the section “Bioinformatics” in the Extended Experimental Procedures and Table S1 available online), and we identified 130 IgSF-, 71 LRR-, and 59 FnIII-containing extracellular and transmembrane proteins, counting one splice variant per gene, resulting in 203 nonredundant genes (Figure 1, step 1). We determined the boundaries of mature extracellular regions, ECDs, of these proteins by predicting signal peptides and, for membrane-bound proteins, transmembrane helices or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage sites. ECDs were cloned into our Drosophila expression vectors (Figure S1A) using conventional PCR if there were existing complementary DNAs (cDNAs) or with RT-PCR from primary RNA samples (Figure 1, step 2). Out of the 203 candidates, we were successful in cloning all but eight of these (96%) into expression vectors. For three proteins, we examined multiple splice variants; we also included three additional proteins of interest, for a total of 202 clones. Our collection is available to the scientific community from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (http://www.fruitfly.org/).Figure S1The Extracellular Interactome Assay, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Circular maps for the Drosophila expression plasmids drawn to approximate scale.(B) Schematic drawings of the baits and prey expressed.(C) Titration ECIA, where six interactions between the indicated Fc (bait) and an AP5 (prey) samples are studied via dilution of the Fc and AP5 samples.

To create a system that would accurately assess interactions between extracellular proteins, we devised a high-throughput assay comprising the following components (Figures 1 and S1B): (1) bait and prey are expressed and secreted from cultured Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells (Figure 1, step 3); (2) baits are fused with human dimeric Fc, which allows for easy capture from conditioned media on staphylococcal Protein-A-coated plates (Figure 1, step 4 and Figure S1B); (3) prey proteins are oligomerized into pentamers by fusing the ECDs to a pentameric helical region of rat cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) (Bushell et al., 2008Bushell K.M.

Multivalent recombinant proteins for probing functions of leucocyte surface proteins such as the CD200 receptor.Immunology. 2005; 115: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This avidity enhancement is a powerful means of capturing low-affinity interactions and also recovering interacting pairs when the prey is only expressed at low protein concentrations (Figure 1, step 4 and Figure S1B). Finally, (4) prey proteins are fused with human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) for facile enzymatic detection using colorigenic substrates (Figure 1, steps 4 and 5 and Figure S1B). The sensitivity in detection is amplified by the pentamerization of the AP tag. The Fc-tagged bait proteins are captured by Protein-A-coated plates directly from conditioned S2 media, and the AP-tagged proteins are directly assayed in conditioned media; therefore, the Extracellular Interactome Assay (ECIA) does not require any sample purification or buffer exchange and is amenable to multiplexing and high-throughput measurements. Starting from initiation of cell culture work to the detection of interactions, the assay can be completed within 5 days (Figure 1, steps 3–5). The most labor-intensive aspects of the extracellular interactome are the cloning of genes from messenger RNA (mRNA) (Figure 1, step 2) and protein expression by transient transfection in eukaryotic cell culture (Figure 1, step 3). However, the labor burden for these steps increases only linearly with the number of proteins tested, allowing for many interactions to be tested without advanced robotic instrumentation. Yet, the ECIA is scalable and could be automated for true high throughput, enabling this methodology to be expanded to very large collections, such as an entire proteome (i.e., millions of possible pairs). We initially performed the ECIA for a subset of 125 proteins, covering nearly all IgSF. Upon demonstrating feasibility, we expanded it to all the extracellular members of the IgSF, FnIII, and LRR protein families. The two ECIA results closely matched, confirming the reproducibility of the assay (Figures S2A and S2B; see the section “ECIA Data Internal Consistency and Reproducibility” in the Extended Experimental Procedures for detailed analysis). For the analysis of our data, we utilized simple statistics, mainly Z scores (see the section “Interactome Data Analysis” in the Extended Experimental Procedures). All detected interactions observed were further verified by repeating the assay in both bait/prey orientations with fresh batches of proteins. We also performed titrations of the bait and prey samples in six selected interactions, which could be fit using concentration-dependent, single-site binding models. We observed that the strength of the binding signal was determined by the interaction partner present in lower abundance (Figures S1C–S1G). The ECIA data set comprises a pairwise matrix of 42,025 experiments (Figure 2A), corresponding to 20,503 unique pairwise interactions (Figure S2B). Each heterophilic interaction was tested twice, with bait and prey in reverse orientations, and these results were in good agreement (see the section “ECIA Data Internal Consistency and Reproducibility” in the Extended Experimental Procedures). The experimental matrix included testing of 202 potential homophilic pairs. Of the observed 106 unique interactions, 20 were homophilic (Figure 2B and Table S2). Based on the Drosophila protein interaction database DroID (Giot et al., 2003Giot L. Bader J.S. Brouwer C. Chaudhuri A. Kuang B. Li Y. Hao Y.L. Ooi C.E. Godwin B.

We analyzed published interactome data sets for the protein families included in our study (Yu et al., 2008Yu J. Pacifico S. Liu G. Finley Jr., R.L. DroID: the Drosophila Interactions Database, a comprehensive resource for annotated gene and protein interactions.BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 461Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In total, there are 285 reported interactions for extracellular IgSF, FnIII, and LRR proteins in the three large-scale experimental interactome data sets present in DroID. None of our 106 interactions were in the DroID-based list (Table S3). In fact, only one of the 285 DroID interactions has been reported independently (Table S4), and a majority of DroID interactions are physically unlikely because the putative interactors are neither cell surface nor extracellular proteins but include many nuclear and intraorganelle proteins (Table S3). In contrast, 22 (21%) of our interaction hits were previously described in the literature. These results demonstrate that Y2H and AP-MS-based interactome studies fail to detect extracellular interactions, and a specialized interactome increases the yield and reliability. The pairwise interactions we detected are shown in Figure 3, highlighting four subfamilies and their interactions within the Drosophila IgSF (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A–S3D ). Two of these subfamilies, the “Beats” (after the protein Beaten Path) with 14 members, and Dpr homologs (after Defective in Proboscis Extension Response) with 20 members (Nakamura et al., 2002Nakamura M. Baldwin D. Hannaford S. Palka J. Montell C. Defective proboscis extension response (DPR), a member of the Ig superfamily required for the gustatory response to salt.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3463-3472PubMed Google Scholar), were previously grouped by virtue of their respective sequence similarities only. For the Beat subfamily (Figure S3A), based on the recent finding that Beaten Path Ia engages another IgSF protein, Sidestep (also known as Side; Siebert et al., 2009Siebert M. Banovic D. Goellner B. Aberle H. Drosophila motor axons recognize and follow a Sidestep-labeled substrate pathway to reach their target fields.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1052-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it was proposed that another seven proteins with related sequences to Sidestep might interact with Beats, but this was not experimentally demonstrated (Aberle, 2009Aberle H.

Choosing the road less traveled by: a ligand-receptor system that controls target recognition by Drosophila motor axons.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The ECIA revealed these physical interactions from an unbiased screen, thus establishing a network of Beat/Side interactions and a subfamily of Beat-interacting proteins that we term the “Sides” (Figures 3B and S3B).Figure S3The Four IgSF Subfamilies of Drosophila, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A–D) The IgSF subfamilies can also be recognized by their conserved domain topologies.

https://openalex.org/W2089138105,"DNA polymerase (pol) β is a model polymerase involved in gap-filling DNA synthesis utilizing two metals to facilitate nucleotidyl transfer. Previous structural studies have trapped catalytic intermediates by utilizing substrate analogs (dideoxy-terminated primer or nonhydrolysable incoming nucleotide). To identify additional intermediates during catalysis, we now employ natural substrates (correct and incorrect nucleotides) and follow product formation in real time with 15 different crystal structures. We are able to observe molecular adjustments at the active site that hasten correct nucleotide insertion and deter incorrect insertion not appreciated previously. A third metal binding site is transiently formed during correct, but not incorrect, nucleotide insertion. Additionally, long incubations indicate that pyrophosphate more easily dissociates after incorrect, compared to correct, nucleotide insertion. This appears to be coupled to subdomain repositioning that is required for catalytic activation/deactivation. The structures provide insights into a fundamental chemical reaction that impacts polymerase fidelity and genome stability."

https://openalex.org/W1981114090,"One of the hallmarks of malignancy is the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from a pro-immune (M1-like) phenotype to an immune-suppressive (M2-like) phenotype. However, the molecular basis of the process is still unclear. MicroRNA (miRNA) comprises a group of small, non-coding RNAs that are broadly expressed by a variety of organisms and are involved in cell behaviors such as suppression or promotion of tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrate that miR-19a-3p, broadly conserved among vertebrates, was downregulated in RAW264.7 macrophage cells of the M2 phenotype in conditoned medium of 4T1 mouse breast tumor cells. This downregulation correlated with an increased expression of the Fra-1 gene, which was reported to act as a pro-oncogene by supporting the invasion and progression of breast tumors. We found significant upregulation of miR-19a-3p in RAW264.7 macrophages after transfection with a miR-19a-3p mimic that resulted in a significant suppression of the expression of this gene. In addition, we could measure the activity of binding between miR-19a-3p and Fra-1 with a psiCHECK luciferase reporter system. Further, transfection of RAW264.7 macrophage cells with the miR-19a-3p mimic decreased the expression of the Fra-1 downstream genes VEGF, STAT3 and pSTAT3. Most importantly, the capacity of 4T1 breast tumor cells to migrate and invade was impaired in vivo by the intratumoral injection of miR-19a-3p. Taken together, these findings indicate that miR-19a-3p is capable of downregulating the M2 phenotype in M2 macrophages and that the low expression of this miRNA has an important role in the upregulation of Fra-1 expression and induction of M2 macrophage polarization."

The second expresses a transcription factor, α1ACT, which coordinates expression of a program of genes involved in neural and Purkinje cell development. α1ACT also contains the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that, when expanded, causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6). When expressed as an independent polypeptide, α1ACT—bearing an expanded polyQ tract—lacks transcription factor function and neurite outgrowth properties, causes cell death in culture, and leads to ataxia and cerebellar atrophy in transgenic mice. Suppression of CACNA1A IRES function in SCA6 may be a potential therapeutic strategy."

Epigenetic regulations are essential for the maintenance of cell identity and the guidance of stepwise cell differentiation. Mutations in epigenetic regulators are linked to many human diseases, including cancer and mental retardation (Berdasco and Esteller, 2010Berdasco M. Esteller M.

As one family of chromatin regulators, ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to slide nucleosomes, dissociate core histones, or relocate the entire histone octamers (Li et al., 2007Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. The role of chromatin during transcription.Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). The dynamic change of nucleosome occupancy at gene promoters provides temporal control of transcription. Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) belongs to the CHD family of chromatin remodelers. CHD proteins are involved in the regulation of multiple biological processes, including chromatin structure reorganization and gene expression (Hall and Georgel, 2007Hall J.A. Georgel P.T. CHD proteins: a diverse family with strong ties.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Importantly, de novo heterozygous mutations of the CHD7 gene are the major cause of the human CHARGE syndrome, a genetic disease characterized by a complex constellation of birth defects (coloboma of the eye, heart defects, atresia of the choanae, severe retardation of growth and development, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities) (Vissers et al., 2004Vissers L.E. van Ravenswaaij C.M. Admiraal R. Hurst J.A. de Vries B.B. Janssen I.M. van der Vliet W.A. Huys E.H. de Jong P.J. Hamel B.C. et al.Mutations in a new member of the chromodomain gene family cause CHARGE syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). It has been shown that CHD7 cooperates with another chromatin remodeling complex PBAF (polybromo- and BRG1-associated factor-containing complex) to regulate neural crest migration, implicating its role in the peripheral system (Bajpai et al., 2010Bajpai R. Chen D.A. Rada-Iglesias A. Zhang J. Xiong Y. Helms J. Chang C.P. Zhao Y. Swigut T. Wysocka J. CHD7 cooperates with PBAF to control multipotent neural crest formation.Nature. 2010; 463: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of the CHARGE patients have mental retardation and olfactory anomalies ranging from absence to hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs (OBs) (Blustajn et al., 2008Blustajn J. Kirsch C.F. Panigrahy A. Netchine I. Olfactory anomalies in CHARGE syndrome: imaging findings of a potential major diagnostic criterion.AJNR Am. J.

A recent study identified CHD7 as a transcriptional cofactor of the essential NSC regulator Sox2 in NSCs using both proteomic and genomic approaches (Engelen et al., 2011Engelen E. Akinci U. Bryne J.C. Hou J. Gontan C. Moen M. Szumska D. Kockx C. van Ijcken W. Dekkers D.H. et al.Sox2 cooperates with Chd7 to regulate genes that are mutated in human syndromes.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of CHD7 in neurogenesis. However, the function of CHD7 in mammalian neurogenesis and the molecular mechanism underlying its role in the human CHARGE syndrome remains largely unknown. The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle (LV) and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus are the major germinal zones of active neurogenesis during adulthood in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) (Alvarez-Buylla and Garcia-Verdugo, 2002Alvarez-Buylla A.

Mammalian neural stem cells.Science. 2000; 287: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (4077) Google Scholar). Astrocyte-like type B cells in the adult SVZ are multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) (Doetsch et al., 1999Doetsch F. Caillé I. Lim D.A. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Subventricular zone astrocytes are neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain.Cell. 1999; 97: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). These cells give rise to transit amplifying type C cells, which in turn differentiate into type A cells (neuroblasts) that migrate to the OB through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) (Alvarez-Buylla and Garcia-Verdugo, 2002Alvarez-Buylla A. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Neurogenesis in adult subventricular zone.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 629-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NSCs in the SGZ are also astrocyte-like cells with their cell bodies residing in the SGZ and their radial processes extending into the granular layer (GL) of the DG (Ming and Song, 2005Ming G.L. Song H. Adult neurogenesis in the mammalian central nervous system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 223-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). The SGZ NSCs mainly give rise to newborn granule cells that are integrated into GL. The adult neurogenic system has been used to study many human neurological-disease-related genes, in particular their roles in regulating NSC self-renewal, differentiation, and maturation of newborn neurons (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao C. Deng W. Gage F.H. Mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis.Cell. 2008; 132: 645-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). Molecularly, adult neurogenesis represents a robust process involving sequential regulation of crucial transcription factors important for cell-fate commitment (Suh et al., 2009Suh H. Deng W. Gage F.H. Signaling in adult neurogenesis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 253-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Epigenetic regulation is proposed to be actively involved in regulation of this process (Ma et al., 2010Ma D.K. Marchetto M.C. Guo J.U. Ming G.L. Gage F.H. Song H. Epigenetic choreographers of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1338-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As a group of important epigenetic regulators, the roles of chromatin remodelers in adult neurogenesis remain largely unknown. To gain insights into the mechanism of chromatin remodelers in regulating adult NSCs, we investigated the function of CHD7 using mouse genetic approaches. Here, we demonstrate that CHD7 expression is specifically enriched in active NSCs and progenitors in the SVZ and SGZ. A NSC-specific inactivation of CHD7 in adult mice leads to a dramatic decrease of neurogenesis. Strikingly, physical exercise can rescue the hippocampal neurogenesis defect in CHD7 mutants. We further show that loss of CHD7 in NSCs represses the expression of Sox4 and Sox11 genes by inducing chromatin condensation of their promoters. And, forced expression of Sox4 and Sox11 in CHD7 mutant NSCs can rescue the neuronal differentiation defect. In summary, our study reveals that the CHARGE syndrome protein CHD7 is a master regulator of governing the neurogenic potential of NSCs. Rescue of the CHD7 mutant phenotype via physical exercise indicates an alternative pathway to overcome CHD7 deficiency, demonstrating the advantage of using adult NSCs to study human brain disease causing genes. These results provide significant insights into the molecular mechanism of chromatin regulation of NSCs fate commitment, which also provide implication to molecular pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome. We first examined the expression of CHD7 in adult mouse brain, particularly in adult NSCs, which to our knowledge has not been reported yet. Data from the Allen Brain Atlas show that the messenger RNA (mRNA) of the CHD7 gene is highly expressed in adult neurogenic regions of the mouse brain, i.e., in the SVZ, RMS, and SGZ (Figure S1A available online). Consistent with the expression of the mRNA, immunostaining assays show that CHD7 protein is present in both the SVZ and SGZ cells (Figures S1B and S1C). To identify the CHD7-expressing cell population in the above-mentioned regions, we performed coimmunostainings of CHD7 with various cellular markers. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a marker for astrocyte-like type B cells, namely, the NSCs in the SVZ (Doetsch et al., 1997Doetsch F. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Cellular composition and three-dimensional organization of the subventricular germinal zone in the adult mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5046-5061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Mash1 and DCX (doublecortin), respectively, mark type C cells, i.e., the transit amplifying cells (Parras et al., 2004Parras C.M. Galli R. Britz O. Soares S. Galichet C. Battiste J. Johnson J.E. Nakafuku M. Vescovi A. Guillemot F. Mash1 specifies neurons and oligodendrocytes in the postnatal brain.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4495-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and type A cells, the neuroblasts. We found that some of the GFAP-positive cells express CHD7 (Figure 1A), indicating that CHD7 is expressed in a subpopulation of SVZ NSCs. Most of Mash1-positive or DCX-positive cells express CHD7 (Figures 1B and 1C), demonstrating that CHD7 is expressed in most of type C and A cells. We next analyzed the proliferation state of CHD7-expressing cells by costaining of CHD7 with a proliferation marker MCM2 (minichromosome maintenance complex component 2). In both the SVZ and SGZ, CHD7 colabels with MCM2 in most of the cells (Figures 1D and 1E), demonstrating that CHD7 is expressed in most fast-dividing cells. To further determine the expression of CHD7 in the adult NSCs, we made use of a transgenic mouse in which GFP expression is under the control of the Tlx BAC-based promoter. Tlx has been shown to be specifically expressed in NSCs, i.e., type B cells in the SVZ and type 1 cells in the SGZ (Liu et al., 2008Liu H.K. Belz T. Bock D. Takacs A. Wu H. Lichter P. Chai M. Schütz G. The nuclear receptor tailless is required for neurogenesis in the adult subventricular zone.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2473-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Niu et al., 2011Niu W. Zou Y. Shen C. Zhang C.L. Activation of postnatal neural stem cells requires nuclear receptor TLX.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13816-13828Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our analyses demonstrate that the expression of Tlx-GFP recapitulates endogenous Tlx expression (Figures S1D–S1F). Adult Tlx-GFP mice were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) 30 min before sacrifice in order to visualize dividing cells in neurogenic regions. Interestingly, most of Tlx-GFPhigh cells in both the SVZ and SGZ were negative for BrdU (Figures 1F and 1G, white arrows), suggesting that they are in a quiescent state. In support of this finding, we observed that Tlx-GFPhigh cells express NSC markers Nestin and GFAP, but not proliferation markers Ki67 and MCM2 (Figures S1G–S1I, arrows). Costaining of CHD7 with GFP and BrdU in these animals shows that some Tlx-GFP-positive cells express CHD7, and many of these colabeled cells were BrdU positive (Figures 1F and 1G, yellow arrows; Figure 1H). In contrast, most Tlx-GFPhigh cells did not express CHD7 (Figures 1F and 1G, white arrows). Moreover, CHD7 is coexpressed with Nestin and Sox2 in both cultured neurospheres and monolayer NSCs (Figures 1I and 1J). These data reveal that NSCs start to express CHD7 upon exiting the quiescent state, and the expression of CHD7 persists in neural progenitors and neuroblasts (Figure 1K). This intriguingly selective expression pattern of this chromatin remodeler suggests that CHD7 is probably involved in a temporal regulatory program during NSC activation, lineage commitment, and progression. To investigate the function of CHD7 in adult neurogenesis, a CHD7 conditional knockout (KO) mouse line (CHD7fl/fl) was established in which the exon 3 is flanked by two loxP sites (Figure S2A). We have previously generated a Tlx-CreERT2 mouse line using a BAC-mediated transgenic approach, where the Cre recombinase is only expressed in type B cells of the adult SVZ (Liu et al., 2008Liu H.K. Belz T. Bock D. Takacs A. Wu H. Lichter P. Chai M. Schütz G. The nuclear receptor tailless is required for neurogenesis in the adult subventricular zone.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2473-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The CHD7fl/fl mice were crossed with Tlx-CreERT2 mice to achieve a tamoxifen (TMX)-inducible mutation of CHD7 in adult SVZ NSCs and their derivatives. Two weeks post-TMX induction (2 wpi), CHD7 was completely removed from the adult mouse SVZ as shown by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay using a CHD7 antibody (Figure S2B). NSCs in the SVZ mainly give rise to neuroblasts that migrate to the OB and differentiate into mature neurons. To investigate the role of CHD7 in these processes, TMX-treated mice (Tlx-CreERT2; CHD7fl/fl and the littermate control) were injected with BrdU and traced for 4 weeks. As shown in Figure 2A, there was a dramatic decrease of BrdU-positive cells in the OB of CHD7 mutants. The number of newborn neurons, as shown by costaining of BrdU and a mature neuronal marker NeuN, was significantly decreased (Figure 2B). Consistently, there were less DCX-positive neuroblasts in the OB of CHD7 mutants compared to the control (Figure 2C). Moreover, the CHD7fl/fl mice were mated to another NSC-specific cre line, Nestin-CreERT2. As shown in Figure S2C, CHD7 is efficiently depleted in Nestin-CreERT2; CHD7fl/fl mice upon TMX treatment. By applying the same BrdU tracing approach as illustrated in Figure 2A, we observed a similar mutant phenotype in these animals as in the Tlx-CreERT2; CHD7fl/fl mice (data not shown). It has been proposed that SVZ NSCs are already predetermined to generate a certain subtype of neurons in the OB (Merkle et al., 2007Merkle F.T. Mirzadeh Z. Alvarez-Buylla A. Mosaic organization of neural stem cells in the adult brain.Science. 2007; 317: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). To analyze whether the decrease of neurogenesis is restricted to certain types of neurons, we performed BrdU costaining with markers (calretinin [CR], tyrosine hydroxylase [TH], and calbindin [CB]) representing different subtypes of interneurons in the OB. As shown in Figure 2D, no preferential loss of certain types of neurons was found in CHD7 mutants, indicating that there is a panneuronal phenotype. We thus assessed whether the self-renewal of NSCs is affected upon CHD7 inactivation. Immunostaining assays did not show any major change in expression of two NSC markers Nestin and Sox2 in the SVZ of CHD7 mutants (Figure S2D), suggesting that the number of NSCs was not altered. We then analyzed the cell proliferation in the SVZ using a 2 hr BrdU-pulse labeling assay. As shown in Figure 2E, there was no significant difference of BrdU incorporation in the control and CHD7 mutants. Analysis with the proliferation marker Ki67 showed similar results (Figure S2E). We next monitored the self-renewal of NSCs using neurosphere formation assay. The number of primary, secondary, and long-term passaged neurospheres formed from the SVZ-derived cells did not significantly differ between the control and CHD7 mutants (Figures 2F and 2G). Thus, loss of CHD7 impairs neurogenesis in the SVZ-OB without affecting the self-renewal of NSCs, which indicates that CHD7 is specifically required for the neuronal differentiation of NSCs. Indeed, the number of transit amplifying cells marked by Mash1 was slightly increased in CHD7 mutants (Figure S2E), indicating a possible blockage of these cells for further neuronal differentiation. Moreover, DCX immunostaining showed that the chain-like structure of migrating neuroblasts was not affected (Figure S2F), ruling out a major defect in the migration of neuroblasts. To further confirm the phenotype of CHD7 mutated NSCs observed in vivo, we established a SVZ NSC culture and tested the neuronal differentiation capacity of control and CHD7 mutant cells. In agreement with the in vivo finding, CHD7 mutant cells, both adult and fetal NSCs, generated significantly less Tuj1-positive neurons upon induction of differentiation (Figure S2G), which demonstrates an indispensable role of CHD7 during neuronal differentiation. In the SVZ, the majority of NSCs differentiate into neuronal lineage. The selective expression pattern of CHD7 in adult SVZ and the neuronal differentiation defect in CHD7 mutants suggest that CHD7, as a chromatin remodeler, plays a specific role for initiating the neuronal differentiation program on the chromatin level. These results also help to understand the olfaction defect that is frequently associated in the human CHARGE patient. The adult hippocampal neurogenic system has often been used to study functions of neurological disease genes linked to learning disability (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao C. Deng W. Gage F.H. Mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis.Cell. 2008; 132: 645-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). Many CHARGE patients have a learning disability (Bergman et al., 2011Bergman J.E. Janssen N. Hoefsloot L.H. Jongmans M.C. Hofstra R.M. van Ravenswaaij-Arts C.M. CHD7 mutations and CHARGE syndrome: the clinical implications of an expanding phenotype.J. Med. Genet. 2011; 48: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The specific expression pattern of CHD7 in the adult SGZ suggests a potential role in regulating the hippocampal neurogenesis. We generated a Nestin-CreERT2; CHD7fl/fl mouse line, which allows us to ablate CHD7 in the SGZ NSCs upon TMX induction (Figure S3A). NSCs in the SGZ generate neuroblasts that give rise to granule cells in the GL. Using the same BrdU tracing approach as used for the SVZ-OB system, we observed that loss of CHD7 in the SGZ NSCs results in a significant reduction of the number of BrdU-positive newborn neurons in the GL (Figure 3A). Moreover, DCX-positive neuroblasts in CHD7 mutants have shorter and less branched dendrites compared to the control (Figure 3B), suggesting a possible defect of dendritic development of newborn neurons. Both Sox2 and CCND2 have been shown to be essential for the maintenance of the SGZ NSCs (Favaro et al., 2009Favaro R. Valotta M. Ferri A.L. Latorre E. Mariani J. Giachino C. Lancini C. Tosetti V. Ottolenghi S. Taylor V. Nicolis S.K. Hippocampal development and neural stem cell maintenance require Sox2-dependent regulation of Shh.Nat.

Sox2 deficiency causes neurodegeneration and impaired neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain.Development. 2004; 131: 3805-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, Suh et al., 2007Suh H. Consiglio A. Ray J. Sawai T. D’Amour K.A. Gage F.H. In vivo fate analysis reveals the multipotent and self-renewal capacities of Sox2+ neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 515-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). By analyzing the RNA extracted from the microdissected hippocampus, we did not observe significant alteration in the expression Sox2 and CCND2 genes in CHD7 mutants as compared to the control (Figure S3B). Intriguingly, we observed a slight increase of Ki67-positive cells and Tbr2-positive transit amplifying cells in the SGZ of CHD7 mutants (Figures 3C and S3C). The accumulation of these cells could be due to a possible blockage of further neuronal differentiation. Thus, like in the SVZ-OB system, depletion of CHD7 in the SGZ NSCs leads to reduction of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Ablating CHD7 in NSCs of the two adult neurogenic regions results in similar phenotype of neuronal differentiation defect, suggesting a general role of CHD7 in regulating neurogenesis. In support of this, we observed a similar phenotype by ablating CHD7 in radial glial cells during embryonic brain development (Figures S3D and S3E). Moreover, we analyzed whether loss of CHD7 in NSCs leads to an alternative fate of their progeny. There was no significant change of glial differentiation in all systems analyzed (SVZ, SGZ, and embryonic brain development) (Figures S3F–S3H). Interestingly, we observed an increase of cell death of newborn CHD7 mutant cells (Figures S3I and S3J), suggesting that CHD7 mutant cells may undergo apoptosis if they cannot be properly differentiated. Epigenetic regulators are considered to be essential players of regulating cell responses to environmental stimuli (Ma et al., 2010Ma D.K. Marchetto M.C. Guo J.U. Ming G.L. Gage F.H. Song H. Epigenetic choreographers of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1338-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Interestingly, environmental stimuli can greatly affect the proliferation and survival of newborn cells in the adult CNS. For example, exposure of rodents to an enriched environment increases the survival of newborn neurons in the SGZ without affecting SVZ neurogenesis (Kempermann et al., 1997Kempermann G. Kuhn H.G. Gage F.H. More hippocampal neurons in adult mice living in an enriched environment.Nature. 1997; 386: 493-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). Physical exercise, such as voluntary running, promotes SGZ neurogenesis by increasing cell proliferation and survival of the newborn granule neurons (van Praag et al., 1999van Praag H. Kempermann G. Gage F.H. Running increases cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (3069) Google Scholar). Given that CHD7 is expressed in active, but not quiescent, NSCs, and the chromatin remodeler identity of CHD7, we anticipated that CHD7 is maybe involved in regulating exercise-induced hippocampal neurogenesis. To test this, we divided the control and CHD7 mutant mice into nonrunner and runner groups. Running was performed as a voluntary exercise in a running wheel and newborn neurons were labeled with BrdU as illustrated in Figure 4A. First, we confirmed the reduction of BrdU-positive cells in the GL of CHD7 mutant nonrunners as compared to the control nonrunners (Figure 4A). As expected, one month of running significantly increased the number of BrdU-positive cells in the GL of the control runners as compared to the control nonrunners (Figure 4A). To our surprise, after running, numbers of BrdU-positive cells in CHD7 mutants were not significantly different from the control runners (Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained when older mice were used for this assay (Figure S4A). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the number of Ki67-positive cells between the control and mutant runners (Figure S4B), indicating that running attenuates the accumulation of proliferating cells in CHD7 mutants (compared to Figure 3C). The observation that CHD7-mutated neuroblasts have shorter and less branched dendrites indicates a defect of dendritic development (Figure 3B). We therefore monitored the dendritic development of newborn neurons in the control and CHD7 mutants. For this, retroviruses expressing GFP were stereotactically injected into the DG to label newborn cells. The animals were analyzed 4 weeks postretroviral injection, and GFP-positive newborn neurons were traced. Intriguingly, the total dendritic length of GFP-positive newborn neurons in the GL of CHD7 mutants was significantly shorter compared to the control (Figures 4B, 4C, and S4C). Although not statistically significant, GFP-positive neurons in CHD7 mutants have less total dendrite branch numbers as compared to the control (Figures 4B, 4C, and S4C). Sholl analysis further demonstrated a decrease in the dendritic complexity of CHD7 mutant neurons (Figure 4D). Thus, loss of CHD7 in the SGZ NSCs not only reduces the number of newborn neurons but also leads to the dendritic abnormality in newborn neurons. To test whether running can have any effect on the dendritic abnormality in CHD7 mutant neurons, we applied the same retroviral-labeling approach to control and CHD7 mutant running mice. Strikingly, all of these above-mentioned defects of dendritic development in newborn neurons of CHD7 mutants were completely rescued after running (Figures 4B–4D; Figure S4C). Together, these results suggest that physical exercise is capable of overcoming the neurogenic defect in the DG of CHD7 mutants, including both the number and the dendritic development of newborn neurons. Our data demonstrate that exercise-induced neurogenesis does not depend on CHD7, which suggests an alternative pathway can guide the neuronal differentiation in the absence of CHD7. All of our above-mentioned results suggest that CHD7 is important for activation of a neuronal differentiation program in NSCs. Next, we aimed to identify the direct target genes of CHD7 in NSCs that are responsible for its function in neurogenesis. For this, we took a computational approach by analyzing the expression profiling data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) (Network and Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008Network, T.C.G.A.R.; Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkComprehensive genomic characterization defines human glioblastoma genes and core pathways.Nature. 2008; 455: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (5794) Google Scholar) because we observed a heterogeneous expression of CHD7 in human brain tumors (data not shown). Because CHD7 occupancy at genes is correlated with active gene expression (Engelen et al., 2011Engelen E. Akinci U. Bryne J.C. Hou J. Gontan C. Moen M. Szumska D. Kockx C. van Ijcken W.

Interestingly, Sox4 and Sox11, two group C genes of the Sox gene family (Kuhlbrodt et al., 1998Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), are on top of the list of genes correlated most with CHD7 expression (Figure 5A).

https://openalex.org/W1987928733,"Several intracellular pathogens, including Salmonella enterica and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, require the virulence protein MgtC to survive within macrophages and to cause a lethal infection in mice. We now report that, unlike secreted virulence factors that target the host vacuolar ATPase to withstand phagosomal acidity, the MgtC protein acts on Salmonella's own F1Fo ATP synthase. This complex couples proton translocation to ATP synthesis/hydrolysis and is required for virulence. We establish that MgtC interacts with the a subunit of the F1Fo ATP synthase, hindering ATP-driven proton translocation and NADH-driven ATP synthesis in inverted vesicles. An mgtC null mutant displays heightened ATP levels and an acidic cytoplasm, whereas mgtC overexpression decreases ATP levels. A single amino acid substitution in MgtC that prevents binding to the F1Fo ATP synthase abolishes control of ATP levels and attenuates pathogenicity. MgtC provides a singular example of a virulence protein that promotes pathogenicity by interfering with another virulence protein."

https://openalex.org/W1967503096,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common inherited muscular dystrophy of childhood, leads to death due to cardiorespiratory failure. Paradoxically, mdx mice with the same genetic deficiency of dystrophin exhibit minimal cardiac dysfunction, impeding the development of therapies. We postulated that the difference between mdx and DMD might result from differences in telomere lengths in mice and humans. We show here that, like DMD patients, mice that lack dystrophin and have shortened telomeres (mdx/mTR(KO)) develop severe functional cardiac deficits including ventricular dilation, contractile and conductance dysfunction, and accelerated mortality. These cardiac defects are accompanied by telomere erosion, mitochondrial fragmentation and increased oxidative stress. Treatment with antioxidants significantly retards the onset of cardiac dysfunction and death of mdx/mTR(KO) mice. In corroboration, all four of the DMD patients analysed had 45% shorter telomeres in their cardiomyocytes relative to age- and sex-matched controls. We propose that the demands of contraction in the absence of dystrophin coupled with increased oxidative stress conspire to accelerate telomere erosion culminating in cardiac failure and death. These findings provide strong support for a link between telomere length and dystrophin deficiency in the etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy in DMD and suggest preventive interventions."

It has been suggested that fluctuating levels of Nanog mediate ESC self-renewal versus differentiation, and low or no Nanog expression is thought to render cells susceptible to intrinsic or extrinsic signals inducing differentiation and generating functional heterogeneity within pluripotent cell populations. Recently, it has been shown that Nanog activity is autorepressive and may regulate allelic switching (Fidalgo et al., 2012Fidalgo M. Faiola F. Pereira C.F. Ding J. Saunders A. Gingold J. Schaniel C. Lemischka I.R. Silva J.C. Wang J. Zfp281 mediates Nanog autorepression through recruitment of the NuRD complex and inhibits somatic cell reprogramming.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

OCT4/SOX2-independent Nanog autorepression modulates heterogeneous Nanog gene expression in mouse ES cells.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 4547-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Nanog can be deleted in ESCs without affecting their potential to generate chimeras (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated variation in Nanog expression using single-cell analysis in mouse ESCs. To monitor the two alleles of Nanog in single cells with single-molecule messenger RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (sm-mRNA-FISH) (Buganim et al., 2012Buganim Y. Faddah D.A. Cheng A.W. Itskovich E. Markoulaki S. Ganz K. Klemm S.L. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R.

Rifkin S.A. van Oudenaarden A. Tyagi S. Imaging individual mRNA molecules using multiple singly labeled probes.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 877-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar), we generated a V6.5 ESC line where GFP was inserted immediately downstream of the Nanog-coding region, the selectable marker being deleted. Using a similar targeting strategy, we inserted sequences encoding mCherry into the second Nanog allele (Figure 1A, Figure S1A available online). In this construct, GFP and mCherry dissociate from Nanog by the self-cleavage of a 2A peptide and do not alter Nanog function. We quantified transcripts of Nanog, mCherry, and GFP in single Nanog-2A-GFP/Nanog-2A-mCherry (NGNC) ESCs by sm-mRNA-FISH and found that all cells expressed mCherry and GFP transcripts (Figure 1B), the total level of Nanog transcripts in a given cell being approximately equal to the sum of the GFP and mCherry transcripts (Figure 1C). Box plot analysis revealed that GFP and mCherry expression levels were equal and approximately half that of Nanog expression (Figure 1D). We quantified mCherry+/GFP+, GFP+, and mCherry+ cells grown in serum and LIF by flow cytometric analysis and found 96% mCherry+/GFP+, 0.6% GFP+, and 0.1% mCherry+ (Figure 1E). Finally, all NGNC cells grown in serum and LIF or 2i and LIF were GFP+ and mCherry+ by immunostaining (Figure S1B). In summary, our results indicate that both Nanog alleles are expressed in the great majority of cells regardless of culture condition. In order to compare the variability of Nanog expression to that of other pluripotency factors, we used sm-mRNA-FISH to quantify transcripts of nine pluripotency genes (Nanog, Dnmt3b, Utf1, Sox2, Lin28, Sall4, Tet1, Klf2, and Fbx15), one housekeeping gene (Gapdh), and a known heterogeneously expressed gene (Stella), each in combination with Oct4 in single cells (Figures 1F–1O and S1C–S1D). Out of 899 cells analyzed, we only identified 1% that were Nanog−/Oct4+ (Figure S1C). Klf2 and Fbx15 were not always coexpressed with Oct4 with 10% of Klf2−/Oct4+ cells and 14% Fbx15−/Oct4+ cells (Figures 1N and S1D). Figure 1O shows 40% Stella−/Oct4+ negative cells, a number slightly lower than the 70%–80% Stella− cells identified by immunofluorescence in a previous report (Hayashi et al., 2008Hayashi K. Lopes S.M. Tang F. Surani M.A. Dynamic equilibrium and heterogeneity of mouse pluripotent stem cells with distinct functional and epigenetic states.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). All genes examined had different levels of expression, and their expression levels ranged in single cells (Figure 1P). Importantly, Stella had the highest coefficient of variation, whereas all other genes, including Nanog and Gapdh, had similar coefficients of variation. These data suggest that Nanog is just as variable in gene expression as any other pluripotency factor and even a housekeeping gene, such as Gapdh (Figure 1Q). Thus, our data, based upon single-cell expression studies, do not support the concept that Nanog is more heterogeneously expressed than most other pluripotency genes. Our conclusions about Nanog expression differ from those seen in prior studies; therefore, we investigated potential explanations. The majority of studies characterizing heterogeneity in Nanog expression have used heterozygous loss-of-function knockin GFP reporters. Specifically, in the Nanog GFP+/GFP− allele generated by Hatano et al., 2005Hatano S.Y. Tada M. Kimura H. Yamaguchi S. Kono T. Nakano T. Suemori H. Nakatsuji N. Tada T. Pluripotential competence of cells associated with Nanog activity.Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, the coding sequences were replaced with a GFP-IRES-puro-pA reporter and a selection cassette in the targeted allele (we designate these cells NHET ESCs), whereas the TNGA allele was generated by inserting the eGFP marker at the Nanog AUG codon (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In a third study, a triplicate GFP sequence had been inserted into one, and a corresponding mCherry construct was inserted into the other Nanog allele, resulting in NGR ESCs. The GFP and mCherry allele also contained an IRES-Neo or IRES-Hygro selection cassette, respectively (Miyanari and Torres-Padilla, 2012Miyanari Y. Torres-Padilla M.E. Control of ground-state pluripotency by allelic regulation of Nanog.Nature. 2012; 483: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Both fluorescent proteins dissociate from Nanog by self-cleavage of a 2A peptide and, thus, were not expected to interfere with Nanog function. Using time-lapse analysis, they observed dynamic fluctuations of Nanog expression in agreement with previous reports (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar; Kalmar et al., 2009Kalmar T. Lim C. Hayward P.

Regulated fluctuations in nanog expression mediate cell fate decisions in embryonic stem cells.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000149Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition, RNA-FISH and allele-specific single-cell RT-PCR found that about 80% of the cells expressed Nanog monoallelically, a fraction that decreased to about 30% when the cells were cultured in 2i and LIF condition. In an effort to reconcile our data with the published Nanog expression patterns, we used sm-mRNA-FISH to measure Nanog, Oct4, and GFP expression in V6.5 ESCs targeted with an identical vector as previously described (NHET ESCs; Hatano et al., 2005Hatano S.Y. Tada M. Kimura H. Yamaguchi S. Kono T. Nakano T. Suemori H. Nakatsuji N. Tada T. Pluripotential competence of cells associated with Nanog activity.Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) or by using the published targeted E14Tg2a ESCs (TNGA; Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar) (Figure S1E). To assess the influence of culture condition, we compared gene expression in NHET ESCs that were grown under three different conditions: (1) on feeders in serum and LIF, (2) on feeders in 2i and LIF and no serum, and (3) on gelatin (no feeders) in 2i and LIF and no serum. Although growth in serum and LIF (condition 1) resulted in a lower number of Nanog transcripts in comparison to growth on feeders in 2i and LIF and no serum (condition 2, Figure 2C), we found that the culture conditions (2) and (3) did not significantly affect the level of Nanog (between 140 and 145 transcripts), of Oct4 (between 190 and 205 transcripts), and of GFP (between 175 and 180 transcripts). In the following experiments, we only used cells grown on feeders that were either cultured in serum and LIF or in 2i and LIF and no serum. Confirming the published data, this analysis revealed that the majority of NHET ESCs cultured in serum and LIF or 2i and LIF were GFP− (79% and 69%, respectively) (Figure 2A). However, the great majority of the GFP− cells grown in 2i and LIF (98%) and 100% of GFP− cells in serum and LIF expressed Nanog RNA. Similarly, most TNGA GFP− ESCs cultured in serum and LIF condition were Nanog+ (Figure 2B). These data, summarized in Figure 2C, indicate that GFP+ and GFP− NHET and TNGA ESCs expressed Nanog and Oct4 mRNA at comparable levels. Cultivation of NHET cells in 2i and LIF substantially increased the number of Nanog transcripts in NHET but not in TNGA cells. Quantification of GFP+ and GFP− fractions in both cells lines cultured in serum and LIF by flow cytometry was consistent with the sm-mRNA-FISH analysis (Figure 2D). Immunostaining of each cell line revealed that both the GFP+ and GFP− cells expressed Nanog and Oct4 protein (Figures 2E and S1F). In both NHET and TNGA cell lines, we found GFP−, GFP+, and “speckled” colonies containing both GFP+ and GFP− cells (Figures 2E and S1F). We also found that GFP− cells can give rise to GFP+ cells, and GFP+ can generate GFP− cells within one or two passages (Figure S1G), which is consistent with previous reports (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). To monitor the nontargeted allele of NHET ESCs, we inserted mCherry immediately downstream of the Nanog coding region (using a Nanog-2A-mCherry construct). We found the NHET GFP− cells to be mCherry+, further supporting the notion that the other allele of Nanog is active in the GFP− cells (Figure S1H). Western blotting was performed on protein derived from the GFP+ and GFP− fractions of NHET and TNGA, and, importantly, these experiments confirmed that GFP expression did not reflect Nanog protein expression (Figures S1I–S1J)—a result different from previously published data (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In summary, these observations demonstrate that (1) only a fraction of NHET and TNGA cells express GFP, which is in agreement with previous reports (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), (2) the NHET and TNGA GFP− cells also express Nanog, (3) 2i and LIF affects Nanog, Oct4, and GFP expression differently in TNGA and NHET ESCs, and (4) the GFP reporter targeting strategies that disrupt one allele may not be a faithful indicator of endogenous Nanog expression. To compare the GFP+ and GFP− cells in terms of their pluripotent state, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles of NHET GFP+ and GFP− cells by single-cell gene expression quantitative RT-PCR using Fluidigm BioMark (Buganim et al., 2012Buganim Y. Faddah D.A. Cheng A.W. Itskovich E. Markoulaki S. Ganz K. Klemm S.L. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R. Single-cell expression analyses during cellular reprogramming reveal an early stochastic and a late hierarchic phase.Cell. 2012; 150: 1209-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) (Figures 2F–2H). The genes tested in this analysis included ESC-associated chromatin remodeling genes and modification enzymes, ESC-cycle regulator genes, pluripotency markers, mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) markers, and genes active in signal transduction pathways important for ESC maintenance and differentiation (see the list of genes in the Figure 2F legend). Expression of all of the genes analyzed showed similar distributions of expression levels in single GFP+ and GFP− cells, supporting the notion that GFP+ and GFP− ESCs have a very similar expression profile (Figure 2F). In agreement with this conclusion, hierarchical clustering (Figure 2G) and principal component analysis (Figure 2H) did not separate the GFP+ and GFP− cells. Only 3% of GFP− cells were separated from the majority of cells, and these most likely represent differentiating cells, given that they differed in cell-cycle regulators and some pluripotency markers. We conclude that the GFP+ and GFP− cells have very similar gene expression profiles, suggesting that they are equivalent in terms of their pluripotency status. To test whether the haploinsufficiency of Nanog was responsible for the large proportion of GFP−/Nanog+ cells in NHET and TNGA ESCs, we overexpressed Nanog (Figures S1K–S1L). NHET and TNGA ESCs were infected with M2rtTA and tetO-Nanog-2A-blue fluorescent protein (BFP). Dox was added to the cells and high BFP+/GFP+ cells were sorted onto feeder MEFs. Equal numbers of cells from single BFP+/GFP+ colonies were plated in the presence and absence of Dox and analyzed for GFP and BFP. We confirmed overexpression of Nanog by sm-mRNA-FISH. In three lines from both NHET and TNGA backgrounds, none exhibited an increase in GFP+ cells upon Nanog overexpression (Figures S1K–S1L). The fact that there is a presence of GFP−/BFP+ cells and the observation that the overexpression of Nanog did not increase the fraction of GFP+ cells (Figure S1K–S1L) are consistent with previous reports (Fidalgo et al., 2012Fidalgo M. Faiola F. Pereira C.F. Ding J. Saunders A. Gingold J. Schaniel C. Lemischka I.R. Silva J.C. Wang J. Zfp281 mediates Nanog autorepression through recruitment of the NuRD complex and inhibits somatic cell reprogramming.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 16202-16207Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar; Navarro et al., 2012Navarro P. Festuccia N. Colby D. Gagliardi A. Mullin N.P. Zhang W. Karwacki-Neisius V. Osorno R. Kelly D.

OCT4/SOX2-independent Nanog autorepression modulates heterogeneous Nanog gene expression in mouse ES cells.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 4547-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It seemed possible that the different Nanog expression patterns in NGNC cells versus NHET and TNGA cells were a result of the gene-targeting strategy used, which, in the latter two cell lines, resulted in a Nanog null allele and may have disturbed normal Nanog regulation. To directly test whether gene targeting Nanog was responsible for GFP fluctuations of Nanog expression, we targeted V6.5 (C57Bl/6 × 129) cells, the background of NHET, and E14Tg2a (129/Ola) cells, the background of TNGA, with our Nanog-2A-GFP vector (Figure S2A). Using sm-mRNA-FISH, immunostaining, and flow cytometry, we found that all V6.5 and E14Tg2a Nanog-2A-GFP cells expressed GFP and Nanog and that GFP expression faithfully reflected Nanog expression, GFP expression (48 transcripts per cell) being approximately half that of Nanog (112 transcripts per cell) in single cells (Figures 2I–2L, S2B, and S2C). To assay for the pluripotency of TNGA and NHET GFP+ and GFP− cells and our V6.5 + Nanog-2A-GFP cells, we sorted 150 of the lowest GFP− cells and 150 of the highest GFP+ cells from TNGA and NHET and counted the number of undifferentiated colonies at 1 week after plating. We also sorted 150 of the lowest GFP+ cells and 150 of the highest GFP+ cells from our V6.5 + Nanog-2A-GFP line. The low GFP+ cells are prone to differentiation, only generating 16 undifferentiated colonies in comparison to the 44 colonies generated from the high GFP+ cells. TNGA and NHET GFP+ and GFP− cells gave rise to approximately the same number of undifferentiated colonies, further supporting that the cells are in equivalent states of pluripotency (Figure S2D). V6.5 + Nanog-2A-GFP ESCs were induced in order to differentiate by treatment with retinoic acid for 48 hr, and, as expected, all GFP was lost (Figure S2E). Similarly to NHET and TNGA, a Nanog-GFP human ESC reporter line generated by inserting GFP into the 5′ untranslated region of the Nanog gene upstream of the Nanog start codon (ATG) yielded many GFP−, ESC-like cells, suggesting a similar regulation of Nanog expression in humans (Fischer et al., 2010Fischer Y. Ganic E. Ameri J. Xian X. Johannesson M. Semb H. NANOG reporter cell lines generated by gene targeting in human embryonic stem cells.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12533Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Figure S2F). The targeting strategy for NGR cells (Miyanari and Torres-Padilla, 2012Miyanari Y. Torres-Padilla M.E. Control of ground-state pluripotency by allelic regulation of Nanog.Nature. 2012; 483: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) did not disrupt the coding sequences of the Nanog alleles but, nevertheless, showed monoallelic expression in a significant fraction of the cells. We considered two possibilities to explain the difference between these results and ours. First, the targeting of the Nanog alleles in NGR cells involved the insertion of a ∼4 kb transgene containing a selectable marker in addition to three repeats of the GFP or mCherry coding sequences into the 3′ untranslated region, resulting in a ∼4 kb insert in comparison our construct that comprised only ∼700 bp with the selection cassette removed. It is possible that the larger insert disrupted Nanog regulation of the NGR alleles. We tested whether the deletion of the selectable marker affected the expression of the inserted transgene and, using sm-mRNA-FISH to measure Nanog and GFP expression, found that the deletion of the selectable marker reduced the proportion of GFP− cells from ∼20% to 0%, suggesting that the size of the genetic construct used may influence the results for this type of reporter (compare Figure 2J to Figure S2G). We also noticed that Miyanari and Torres-Padilla, 2012Miyanari Y. Torres-Padilla M.E. Control of ground-state pluripotency by allelic regulation of Nanog.Nature. 2012; 483: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar used C57BL/6 × cas (BC1) ESCs and C57BL/6 (BD10) ESCs, whereas we used C57BL/6 × 129 (V6.5) ESCs. To examine whether genetic background could affect Nanog and Oct4 expression heterogeneity, we measured Nanog and Oct4 expression in single ESCs from different genetic backgrounds cultured in serum and LIF and 2i and LIF with sm-mRNA-FISH (Figures S2H and 2C [both contain V6.5 and E14Tg2a data]). Out of 1,113 single cells analyzed from the six ESC lines, we only found three cells with no Nanog transcripts, consistent with our previous data in Figure S1C. However, we also found that V6.5 had fewer low Nanog-expressing cells (0%) in comparison to V26.2 (C57BL/6) (9%) and ESC1 (C57BL/6 × cas) (13%) in serum and LIF condition (Figure S2I). Importantly, these low Nanog+ cells were not differentiated and highly expressed Oct4 (∼150 transcripts per cell). Thus, genetic background does appear to influence the pattern of Nanog expression. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Filipczyk et al., 2013Filipczyk A. Gkatzis K. Fu J. Hoppe P. Lickert H. Anastassiadis K. Schroeder T. Biallelic expression of Nanog protein in mouse embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13 (this issue): 12-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar generated ESCs that carried different fluorescent reporters in both alleles of Nanog, similar to the construct described in Figure 1A. In agreement with our results (Figures 1B–1E) they observed that most cells expressed both reporters, although with greater variability in expression level, which may, in part, be a result of their use of a larger size insert. In summary, using single-cell analysis, we have found that Nanog is biallelically expressed in mouse ESCs and that the degree of variation in expression level is very similar to that of many other pluripotency factors. We do not see evidence of a distinct subpopulation of cells with low Nanog expression, although it is possible that such a population exists in some circumstances. Our analysis of a range of Nanog-GFP reporters suggests that the disruption of one of the two alleles or the insertion of a large downstream cassette may disturb normal transcriptional control and, thus, not give a faithful reflection of endogenous Nanog expression. More broadly, our findings also suggest that these issues are important to take into account when designing reporter constructs to monitor other factors, both in the pluripotency network and beyond.

Numerous involved TFs have been identified, but a subset of core pluripotency TFs regulates the majority of others. One such factor, Nanog, is expressed in pluripotent cells, is required for self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro, is able to force ESC self-renewal upon overexpression in the absence of LIF, and is necessary for the normal development of early mouse embryos (reviewed in Young, 2011).

https://openalex.org/W2016036036,"Killing cancer cells through the induction of apoptosis is one of the main mechanisms of chemotherapy. However, numerous cancer cells have primary or acquired apoptosis resistance, resulting in chemoresistance. In this study, using a novel chalcone derivative chalcone-24 (Chal-24), we identified a novel anticancer mechanism through autophagy-mediated necroptosis (RIP1- and RIP3-dependent necrosis). Chal-24 potently killed different cancer cells with induction of necrotic cellular morphology while causing no detectable caspase activation. Blocking the necroptosis pathway with either necrostatin-1 or by knockdown of RIP1 and RIP3 effectively blocked the cytotoxicity of Chal-24, suggesting that Chal-24-induced cell death is associated with necroptosis. Chal-24 robustly activated JNK and ERK and blockage of which effectively suppressed Chal-24-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, Chal-24 strongly induced autophagy that is dependent on JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and dissociation of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL from Beclin-1. Importantly, suppression of autophagy, with either pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNAs targeting the essential autophagy components ATG7 and Beclin-1, effectively attenuated Chal-24-induced cell death. Furthermore, we found that autophagy activation resulted in c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 degradation and formation of the Ripoptosome that contributes to necroptosis. These results thus establish a novel mechanism for killing cancer cells that involves autophagy-mediated necroptosis, which may be employed for overcoming chemoresistance."

https://openalex.org/W1974909493,"Cachexia is a serious complication of many chronic diseases, such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although patients with advanced CHF or CKD often have increased angiotensin II (Ang II) levels and cachexia and Ang II causes skeletal muscle wasting in rodents, the potential effects of Ang II on muscle regeneration are unknown. Muscle regeneration is highly dependent on the ability of a pool of muscle stem cells (satellite cells) to proliferate and to repair damaged myofibers or form new myofibers. Here we show that Ang II reduced skeletal muscle regeneration via inhibition of satellite cell (SC) proliferation. Ang II reduced the number of regenerating myofibers and decreased expression of SC proliferation/differentiation markers (MyoD, myogenin, and active-Notch) after cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury in vivo and in SCs cultured in vitro. Ang II depleted the basal pool of SCs, as detected in Myf5nLacZ/+ mice and by FACS sorting, and this effect was inhibited by Ang II AT1 receptor (AT1R) blockade and in AT1aR-null mice. AT1R was highly expressed in SCs, and Notch activation abrogated the AT1R-mediated antiproliferative effect of Ang II in cultured SCs. In mice that developed CHF postmyocardial infarction, there was skeletal muscle wasting and reduced SC numbers that were inhibited by AT1R blockade. Ang II inhibition of skeletal muscle regeneration via AT1 receptor-dependent suppression of SC Notch and MyoD signaling and proliferation is likely to play an important role in mechanisms leading to cachexia in chronic disease states such as CHF and CKD.Background: Angiotensin II is elevated in cachexia and induces skeletal muscle atrophy.Results: Angiotensin inhibits muscle stem (satellite) cell proliferation via a Notch-dependent mechanism and depletes the satellite cell pool.Conclusion: Angiotensin prevents skeletal muscle regeneration by suppressing satellite cell function.Significance: This is the first report to show that satellite cells express angiotensin receptors and that angiotensin inhibits regeneration. Cachexia is a serious complication of many chronic diseases, such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although patients with advanced CHF or CKD often have increased angiotensin II (Ang II) levels and cachexia and Ang II causes skeletal muscle wasting in rodents, the potential effects of Ang II on muscle regeneration are unknown. Muscle regeneration is highly dependent on the ability of a pool of muscle stem cells (satellite cells) to proliferate and to repair damaged myofibers or form new myofibers. Here we show that Ang II reduced skeletal muscle regeneration via inhibition of satellite cell (SC) proliferation. Ang II reduced the number of regenerating myofibers and decreased expression of SC proliferation/differentiation markers (MyoD, myogenin, and active-Notch) after cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury in vivo and in SCs cultured in vitro. Ang II depleted the basal pool of SCs, as detected in Myf5nLacZ/+ mice and by FACS sorting, and this effect was inhibited by Ang II AT1 receptor (AT1R) blockade and in AT1aR-null mice. AT1R was highly expressed in SCs, and Notch activation abrogated the AT1R-mediated antiproliferative effect of Ang II in cultured SCs. In mice that developed CHF postmyocardial infarction, there was skeletal muscle wasting and reduced SC numbers that were inhibited by AT1R blockade. Ang II inhibition of skeletal muscle regeneration via AT1 receptor-dependent suppression of SC Notch and MyoD signaling and proliferation is likely to play an important role in mechanisms leading to cachexia in chronic disease states such as CHF and CKD. Background: Angiotensin II is elevated in cachexia and induces skeletal muscle atrophy. Results: Angiotensin inhibits muscle stem (satellite) cell proliferation via a Notch-dependent mechanism and depletes the satellite cell pool. Conclusion: Angiotensin prevents skeletal muscle regeneration by suppressing satellite cell function. Significance: This is the first report to show that satellite cells express angiotensin receptors and that angiotensin inhibits regeneration. Cachexia is typically associated with chronic diseases such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), 2The abbreviations used are: CHF, congestive heart failure; Ang II, angiotensin II; AT1R, angiotensin type 1 receptor; LAD, left anterior descending; d5, day 5; eMyHC, embryonic myosin heavy chain; AT1aR, angiotensin type 1a receptor; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; SC, satellite cell; CSA, cross-sectional area. chronic kidney disease, and chronic infections, and it independently worsens outcome (1.Tan B.H. Fearon K.C. Cachexia. Prevalence and impact in medicine.Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2008; 11: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Mechanisms are complex and can include anorexia, increased cytokines, insulin resistance, and accelerated muscle protein breakdown (2.Evans W.J. Morley J.E. Argilés J. Bales C. Baracos V.

There is increasing evidence that angiotensin II (Ang II), the main effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin system, may play an important role in triggering cachexia. Thus, patients with advanced CHF and chronic kidney disease often have elevated circulating Ang II, and treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor can reduce weight loss (3.Anker S.D.

There is also interest in the potential role of Ang II in cachexia associated with cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.Sanders P.M. Russell S.T. Tisdale M.J.

In these animals, Ang II disrupted insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling, resulting in increased muscle protein degradation and apoptosis (6.Brink M. Wellen J. Delafontaine P.

However, it remains unknown whether normal skeletal muscle regenerative responses occur in the setting of Ang II-induced muscle catabolism and wasting. In fact, little is known about the regenerative potential of skeletal muscle in chronic wasting conditions other than that it clearly appears insufficient to sustain normal muscle mass. Muscle regeneration has been studied using animal models such as the cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced injury model (14.Yan Z. Choi S. Liu X. Zhang M. Schageman J.J. Lee S.Y. Hart R. Lin L. Thurmond F.A. Williams R.S. Highly coordinated gene regulation in mouse skeletal muscle regeneration.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8826-8836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Injury leads to activation and proliferation of mitotically quiescent mononuclear cells, satellite cells, which form myoblasts, differentiate terminally, and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes (15.Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Day K. Regenerating the Heart: Stem Cells and the Cardiovascular System. Springer, New York2011: 173-200Crossref Google Scholar). In adult skeletal muscle, satellite cell number and regenerative capacity remain nearly constant through multiple cycles of regeneration (16.McCroskery S. Thomas M. Maxwell L. Sharma M. Kambadur R. Myostatin negatively regulates satellite cell activation and self-renewal.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 17.Sacco A. Doyonnas R. Kraft P. Vitorovic S. Blau H.M. Self-renewal and expansion of single transplanted muscle stem cells.Nature. 2008; 456: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). However, there is a depletion of satellite cell number and a decline of muscle tissue regeneration with age (18.Shefer G. Van de Mark D.P. Richardson J.B. Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Satellite-cell pool size does matter. Defining the myogenic potency of aging skeletal muscle.Dev. Biol. 2006; 294: 50-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 19.Chakkalakal J.V. Jones K.M. Basson M.A. Brack A.S. The aged niche disrupts muscle stem cell quiescence.Nature. 2012; 490: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In aged satellite cells, the proliferative potential declines because of decreased activation of the Notch pathway and increased TGF-β signaling (20.Carlson M.E. Hsu M. Conboy I.M. Imbalance between pSmad3 and Notch induces CDK inhibitors in old muscle stem cells.Nature. 2008; 454: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Increased TGF-β signaling is also implicated in the myopathy and reduced skeletal muscle regeneration that occurs in fibrillin 1 heterozygous mutant mice and in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice (21.Cohn R.D. van Erp C. Habashi J.P. Soleimani A.A. Klein E.C. Lisi M.T. Gamradt M. ap Rhys C.M. Holm T.M. Loeys B.L. Ramirez F. Judge D.P. Ward C.W. Dietz H.C. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade attenuates TGF-β-induced failure of muscle regeneration in multiple myopathic states.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Blockade of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) signaling suppressed TGF-β signaling and improved muscle regeneration and function in these mice (21.Cohn R.D. van Erp C. Habashi J.P. Soleimani A.A. Klein E.C. Lisi M.T. Gamradt M. ap Rhys C.M. Holm T.M. Loeys B.L. Ramirez F. Judge D.P. Ward C.W. Dietz H.C. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade attenuates TGF-β-induced failure of muscle regeneration in multiple myopathic states.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Although this report suggests a relation between Ang II and myopathy, the potential direct effects of Ang II on muscle regenerative capacity and mechanisms involved remain unknown. Assessment of the direct effects of Ang II is important because adult skeletal muscle expresses low levels of Ang II receptors (22.Zhang L. Du J. Hu Z. Han G. Delafontaine P. Garcia G. Mitch W.E. IL-6 and serum amyloid A synergy mediates angiotensin II-induced muscle wasting.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and many of the effects of Ang II on adult skeletal muscle are thought to be indirect via intermediate cytokines (8.Song Y.-H. Li Y. Du J. Mitch W.E. Rosenthal N. Delafontaine P. Muscle-specific expression of IGF-1 blocks angiotensin II-induced skeletal muscle wasting.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 22.Zhang L. Du J. Hu Z. Han G. Delafontaine P. Garcia G. Mitch W.E. IL-6 and serum amyloid A synergy mediates angiotensin II-induced muscle wasting.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Here we report that Ang II acts directly via AT1R expressed on satellite cells to prevent their proliferation, which results in attenuated skeletal muscle regeneration. Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Tulane University. 8- to 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Inc.), AT1aR−/− (B6.129P2-Agtr1atm1Unc/J, The Jackson Laboratory) and Myf5nLacZ/+, were used in this study. Ang II (1.5 μg/kg/min via osmotic minipumps) and candesartan (10 mg/kg/day via drinking water) were administered as described previously (9.Yoshida T. Semprun-Prieto L. Sukhanov S. Delafontaine P.

For the quantification of CD45−/Sca-1−/CD11b−/CD31−/CD34+/Integrinα7+ satellite cells, mononuclear cells were collected as described previously (23.Ieronimakis N. Balasundaram G. Reyes M. Direct isolation, culture and transplant of mouse skeletal muscle derived endothelial cells with angiogenic potential.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e0001753Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), followed by FACS sorting on the basis of cell surface marker expressions. Briefly, hind limb (gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, soleus, and extensor digitorum longus) muscles were harvested, minced, and digested with 2 mg/ml collagenase type IV (Worthington) and 1.2 units/ml dispase for 45 min at 37 °C. After filtration and washing, 1 × 105 cells were used for staining.

Single myofibers and satellite cells were collected as described previously (24.Conboy I.M. Conboy M.J. Smythe G.M. Rando T.A.

Briefly, hind limb muscles (gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior, and extensor digitorum longus) were incubated with 0.2% (w/v) collagenase type II in DMEM and 10% horse serum for 2 h at 37 °C. Digested muscles were dissociated by triturating with a Pasteur pipette, washed, and further digested with 1 units/ml dispase for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were filtered, washed, and incubated in proliferation medium (DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS (Mediatech), 10% horse serum, 2% chicken embryo extract (US Biological), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin) for 40 min to let the fibroblasts attach onto the plate, and unattached cells were plated onto Matrigel-coated plates in the proliferation medium at the density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2. Satellite cells were collected as described above and plated on Matrigel-coated 96-well plates in the proliferation medium. Cell proliferation, cell viability, and caspase 3/7 activity were measured after 24 h. For the cell proliferation analysis, Ang II (10–1000 nm), candesartan (AstraZeneca, 100 nm), and anti-Notch antibody (Millipore, 1:300) were added in culture together with BrdU (10 μm) and incubated for 24 h. BrdU incorporation was measured using a BrdU cell proliferation ELISA kit (Roche) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Cell viability and caspase 3/7 were measured using a CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) and Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega), respectively, in the presence of Ang II (10–1000 nm) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously (9.Yoshida T. Semprun-Prieto L. Sukhanov S. Delafontaine P.

Angiotensin II infusion induces marked diaphragmatic skeletal muscle atrophy.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e30276Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we have observed very few actively regenerating myofibers with centralized nuclei after Ang II infusion. To determine whether Ang II reduced muscle repair, we analyzed the effect of Ang II on CTX-induced skeletal muscle regeneration (Fig. 1). There was a robust increase in the number of regenerating myofibers in CTX-injected gastrocnemius muscles on d5 and 7, which was markedly attenuated by Ang II (Fig. 1, A–C). Ang II reduced the cross-sectional area of regenerating myofibers on d7 (this could also reflect the atrophic effect of Ang II, Fig. 1D) and decreased muscle weight (Fig. 1E). Consistent with a previous report (14.Yan Z. Choi S. Liu X. Zhang M. Schageman J.J. Lee S.Y. Hart R. Lin L. Thurmond F.A. Williams R.S. Highly coordinated gene regulation in mouse skeletal muscle regeneration.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8826-8836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), a number of myogenic transcription factors were up-regulated after CTX injury. Pax7, MyoD, and myogenin mRNA expression reached a maximal level on d3, and Ang II significantly attenuated their increase (Fig. 1, F–H). Embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC) reached a maximal level on d5 and was also suppressed by Ang II (Fig. 1I). These data strongly suggest that Ang II inhibits activation and/or proliferation of satellite cells, resulting in decreased skeletal muscle regeneration. There was a marked decrease of angiotensin type 1a receptor (AT1aR) mRNA expression 3 days after CTX injection, and Ang II further suppressed AT1aR expression throughout the experiment. In contrast, angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) gene expression increased after CTX injection and reached a maximal level on d5, and Ang II significantly suppressed the increase at d3, with a trend to suppression on d5 (p = 0.15). The data in Fig. 1 strongly suggest that Ang II prevents skeletal muscle regeneration via suppression of the satellite cell regenerative capacity. It has been shown that the total number of quiescent satellite cells remains constant over repeated cycles of degeneration and regeneration via a process of self-renewal (16.McCroskery S. Thomas M. Maxwell L. Sharma M. Kambadur R. Myostatin negatively regulates satellite cell activation and self-renewal.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 17.Sacco A. Doyonnas R. Kraft P. Vitorovic S. Blau H.M. Self-renewal and expansion of single transplanted muscle stem cells.Nature. 2008; 456: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and that the maintenance of satellite cell number is critical for the normal function of skeletal muscle (19.Chakkalakal J.V. Jones K.M. Basson M.A. Brack A.S. The aged niche disrupts muscle stem cell quiescence.Nature. 2012; 490: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). We used X-gal staining to quantify the satellite cell number in sham-infused and Ang II-infused Myf5nLacZ/+ mice, in which the β-gal gene is knocked into the Myf5 locus (27.Day K. Shefer G. Shearer A. Yablonka-Reuveni Z. The depletion of skeletal muscle satellite cells with age is concomitant with reduced capacity of single progenitors to produce reserve progeny.Dev. Biol. 2010; 340: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Approximately 3–4% of total nuclei were positive for β-gal, and there was a 39.4% and 37.1% reduction of the β-gal+ cell number in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles after 7 days of Ang II infusion, respectively, suggesting that Ang II prevents skeletal muscle regeneration through depletion of satellite cells (Fig. 2, B and C). The β-gal+ cell number was also quantified per myofiber CSA and per myofiber number, and all of these data showed a similar reduction (39.4% reduction by DAPI count, 33.2% reduction by CSA, and 43.4% reduction by myofiber number; p = not significant), indicating that the reduction of the β-gal+ cell number was not caused by infiltration of inflammatory cells or by reduced myofiber CSA. We also analyzed the satellite cell number using flow cytometry to detect cells expressing a combination of markers useful for prospective isolation of satellite cells, namely, CD45−/Sca-1−/CD11b−/CD31−/CD34+/Integrinα7+ (Fig. 2D) (17.Sacco A. Doyonnas R. Kraft P. Vitorovic S. Blau H.M. Self-renewal and expansion of single transplanted muscle stem cells.Nature. 2008; 456: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Consistent with the data obtained from Myf5nLacZ/+ mice, there was a decrease in the number of CD45−/Sca-1−/CD11b−/CD31−/CD34+/Integrinα7+ cells in muscles from Ang II-infused C57BL/6 mice on d7 (Fig. 2E), and this reduction was prevented completely by the AT1R blocker candesartan (E) or in angiotensin type 1a receptor-null (AT1aR−/−) mice (F). These data indicate that Ang II depletes satellite cells through AT1R-mediated signaling. We have shown previously that skeletal muscle and cultured myocytes do not express significant levels of AT1R (22.Zhang L. Du J. Hu Z. Han G. Delafontaine P. Garcia G. Mitch W.E.

Thus, Ang II-induced skeletal muscle atrophy results, in large part, from indirect effects mediated via increased glucocorticoids (8.Song Y.-H. Li Y. Du J. Mitch W.E. Rosenthal N. Delafontaine P.

Less is known about the way in which signals and polarity cues integrate with intracellular structures to ensure appropriate niche organization and function. Here, we report that nuclear lamins function in the cyst stem cells (CySCs) of Drosophila testes to control the interaction of CySCs with the hub. This interaction is important for regulation of CySC differentiation and organization of the niche that supports the germline stem cells (GSCs). Lamin promotes nuclear retention of phosphorylated ERK in the CySC lineage by regulating the distribution of specific nucleoporins within the nuclear pores. Lamin-regulated nuclear epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling in the CySC lineage is essential for proliferation and differentiation of the GSCs and the transient amplifying germ cells. Thus, we have uncovered a role for the nuclear lamina in the integration of EGF signaling to regulate stem cell niche function."

Our results identify a key regulator of cortical development and demonstrate that changes in the orientation of progenitor division are responsible for the transition between symmetric and asymmetric cell division. In developing mammalian brains, huge numbers of neurons are generated from a relatively small number of neural progenitor cells. For this, neural progenitors expand by symmetric division before switching to an asymmetric division mode to generate neurons (Götz and Huttner, 2005Götz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). In the developing mouse brain, neuroepithelial progenitors (NPs) span from the ventricular to the pial surface of the neural tube before the onset of neurogenesis. At around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5), neurogenesis begins with the transformation of NPs into radial glial progenitors (RGPs), which express astroglial hallmarks such as brain lipid binding protein (BLBP), the astrocyte-specific glutamate transporter (GLAST), and Tenascin C (TN-C) (Haubensak et al., 2004Haubensak W.

Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). RGPs display apical-basal polarity and bear apical and basal processes that maintain their contacts with both the ventricular and pial surfaces. However, the cell bodies of RGPs are confined to the ventricular zone (VZ) that lines the lateral wall of the ventricles. In concert with their cell-cycle state, they undergo interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) (Taverna and Huttner, 2010Taverna E. Huttner W.B. Neural progenitor nuclei IN motion.Neuron. 2010; 67: 906-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar): RGPs go through mitosis at the apical surface of the VZ. During the G1-S phase of the cell cycle, they migrate basally so that S phase reproducibly occurs on the basal edge of the VZ. RGPs display two modes of cell division. They divide symmetrically and generate two daughter cells that retain RGP properties to expand the number of neural progenitors. Alternatively, they divide asymmetrically giving rise to distinct daughter cell fates. Asymmetric RGP divisions produce either one RGP and one neuron or generate one RGP and one basal progenitor (BP, also called intermediate progenitor) (Noctor et al., 2004Noctor S.C.

BPs delaminate from the VZ and form the second germinal zone, the subventricular zone (SVZ), where they divide symmetrically to generate two neurons. In some cases, they can also generate two BPs to expand the basal progenitor pool (Noctor et al., 2004Noctor S.C. Martínez-Cerdeño V. Ivic L. Kriegstein A.R.

BPs emerge at E10.5 and become abundant from E13.5–E16.5, coinciding with the peak of neurogenesis (Englund et al., 2005Englund C. Fink A. Lau C. Pham D. Daza R.A. Bulfone A. Kowalczyk T. Hevner R.F. Pax6, Tbr2, and Tbr1 are expressed sequentially by radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, and postmitotic neurons in developing neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). They are thought to be the source of most, if not all, neurons in the cortex (Sessa et al., 2008Sessa A. Mao C.A. Hadjantonakis A.K. Klein W.H. Broccoli V. Tbr2 directs conversion of radial glia into basal precursors and guides neuronal amplification by indirect neurogenesis in the developing neocortex.Neuron. 2008; 60: 56-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The transition of NPs into RGPs is a crucial event during mammalian brain development. Even subtle changes in progenitor cell numbers resulting from increased symmetric divisions at the onset of neurogenesis can have dramatic effects on the expansion of the cortical surface and ultimately on brain size (Rakic, 1995Rakic P.

Mice expressing a stabilized form of β-Catenin in NPs, for example, display a significantly increased number of neural progenitors and show considerably increased cerebral cortical surface area and brain size (Chenn and Walsh, 2002Chenn A. Walsh C.A. Regulation of cerebral cortical size by control of cell cycle exit in neural precursors.Science. 2002; 297: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). The timing of the NP to RGP transition is controlled by Notch signaling. Constitutively expressed activated Notch1, for example, promotes RGP cell fate in the developing mouse forebrain (Gaiano et al., 2000Gaiano N. Nye J.S. Fishell G. Radial glial identity is promoted by Notch1 signaling in the murine forebrain.Neuron. 2000; 26: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In addition, Fgf10 has been shown to regulate the differentiation of NPs into RGPs (Sahara and O’Leary, 2009Sahara S. O’Leary D.D. Fgf10 regulates transition period of cortical stem cell differentiation to radial glia controlling generation of neurons and basal progenitors.Neuron. 2009; 63: 48-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Precisely how the transition between proliferative and neurogenic divisions is controlled to safeguard the proper number of neural progenitors is not clear. Orientation of the mitotic spindle has been implicated in regulating symmetric and asymmetric cell division of neural progenitors, both in invertebrates and vertebrates (Morin and Bellaïche, 2011Morin X.

Spindle orientation in mammalian cerebral cortical development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In Drosophila neuroblasts, spindle orientation is essential for correct asymmetric segregation of the cell fate determinants Numb, Brat, and Prospero into only one daughter cell and for correctly specifying neuronal and neuroblast fates (Knoblich, 2008Knoblich J.A. Mechanisms of asymmetric stem cell division.Cell. 2008; 132: 583-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). In the developing mouse brain, early symmetric NP divisions occur with a mitotic spindle that is oriented parallel to the ventricular surface during the neuroepithelial stages before neurogenesis begins. Spindle orientation is tightly controlled by Lis1 (also known as Pafah1b1), a gene that is mutated in lissencephaly (smooth brain) patients and Lis1 acts with its binding partners Ndel1 and dynein (Shu et al., 2004Shu T. Ayala R. Nguyen M.D. Xie Z. Gleeson J.G. Tsai L.H.

Neuroepithelial stem cell proliferation requires LIS1 for precise spindle orientation and symmetric division.Cell. 2008; 132: 474-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The Lis1/Ndel1/dynein complex interacts with the plus ends of astral microtubules and promotes microtubule capture at the cell cortex. Disruption of Lis1 leads to misorientation of the mitotic spindle in NPs and programmed cell death of NPs, suggesting a role of spindle orientation in the regulation of NP survival (Yingling et al., 2008Yingling J. Youn Y.H. Darling D. Toyo-Oka K. Pramparo T. Hirotsune S. Wynshaw-Boris A. Neuroepithelial stem cell proliferation requires LIS1 for precise spindle orientation and symmetric division.Cell. 2008; 132: 474-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). During the peak of neurogenesis, the fraction of obliquely/vertically oriented spindles rises with increasing neurogenesis rates (Huttner and Kosodo, 2005Huttner W.B. Kosodo Y.

Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, Gauthier-Fisher et al., 2009Gauthier-Fisher A. Lin D.C. Greeve M. Kaplan D.R. Rottapel R. Miller F.D. Lfc and Tctex-1 regulate the genesis of neurons from cortical precursor cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, oblique spindle orientation mediated by overexpression of the mouse protein Inscuteable has been shown to regulate indirect neurogenesis rates (Postiglione et al., 2011Postiglione M.P. Jüschke C. Xie Y. Haas G.A. Charalambous C. Knoblich J.A. Mouse inscuteable induces apical-basal spindle orientation to facilitate intermediate progenitor generation in the developing neocortex.Neuron. 2011; 72: 269-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Collectively, orientation of the mitotic spindle plays various roles over the course of cortical development. How spindle orientation regulates neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation, especially at the onset of neurogenesis, however, is poorly understood. Many of the key regulators of neurogenesis have been identified in the fruitfly Drosophila and were later shown to act similarly in the mouse neocortex (Brand and Livesey, 2011Brand A.H. Livesey F.J. Neural stem cell biology in vertebrates and invertebrates: more alike than different?.Neuron. 2011; 70: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, we make use of a genome-wide RNAi screen performed in Drosophila neuroblasts to identify the protein phosphatase PP4c (PP4c) as a regulator of mouse cortical neurogenesis. In Drosophila neuroblasts, PP4c is required for correct asymmetric cell division (Sousa-Nunes et al., 2009Sousa-Nunes R. Chia W. Somers W.G. Protein phosphatase 4 mediates localization of the Miranda complex during Drosophila neuroblast asymmetric divisions.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and acts as a tumor suppressor that is required for proper control of neural stem cell number (Neumüller et al., 2011Neumüller R.A. Richter C. Fischer A. Novatchkova M. Neumüller K.G. Knoblich J.A. Genome-wide analysis of self-renewal in Drosophila neural stem cells by transgenic RNAi.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 580-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We examined mice in which PP4c is deleted by Emx1Cre or NestinCre at different stages of cortical development. At the onset of neurogenesis, loss of PP4c resulted in a spindle misoriention phenotype in neural progenitors and caused them to switch from proliferative to neurogenic divisions. Eventually, this led to severe defects in cortical layering. When PP4c was removed during later stages, however, cortical layering is unaltered even though spindle orientation is randomized. Our data suggest that precise spindle orientation is required for cortical development during a critical time window to prevent asymmetric neurogenic divisions at the early stages of cortical development. To evaluate the role of PP4c during cortical development, we first examined its expression in the developing mouse brain. In situ hybridization showed abundant PP4c mRNA expression in the VZ (Figures S1A–S1C available online). Western blot analysis revealed that PP4c expression was high at E11.5 when the cortical neuroepithelium is largely composed of neural progenitors, persisted until E17.5, and was downregulated in the postnatal stage (Figure 1A). Immunostaining of E14.5 cortical sections showed that PP4c expression was increased in the VZ compared to the more basal cortical areas (Figure 1B). Higher magnification and costaining with γ-Tubulin revealed that PP4c localized to the centrosomes of RGPs located at the VZ surface (Figures 1C and 1D). This is consistent with the localization of PP4c in Drosophila embryos (Helps et al., 1998Helps N.R. Brewis N.D. Lineruth K. Davis T. Kaiser K. Cohen P.T. Protein phosphatase 4 is an essential enzyme required for organisation of microtubules at centrosomes in Drosophila embryos.J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian cell lines (Figures S1D and S1E) (Toyo-oka et al., 2008Toyo-oka K. Mori D. Yano Y. Shiota M. Iwao H. Goto H. Inagaki M. Hiraiwa N. Muramatsu M. Wynshaw-Boris A. et al.Protein phosphatase 4 catalytic subunit regulates Cdk1 activity and microtubule organization via NDEL1 dephosphorylation.J.

PPX, a novel protein serine/threonine phosphatase localized to centrosomes.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The higher expression levels of PP4c during embryogenesis and its centrosomal localization in RGPs suggest that PP4c might be important for embryonic brain development. To analyze the role of PP4c in cortical development, we conditionally inactivated PP4c in the developing neocortex by crossing mice with loxP-flanked alleles of PP4c (PP4cflox/flox) (Toyo-oka et al., 2008Toyo-oka K. Mori D. Yano Y. Shiota M. Iwao H. Goto H. Inagaki M. Hiraiwa N. Muramatsu M.

Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1133-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with Emx1Cre. Emx1Cre drives Cre-mediated recombination in cortical progenitors and activates at E10.5 when neurogenesis begins (Gorski et al., 2002Gorski J.A. Talley T. Qiu M. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L.

Lhx2 specifies regional fate in Emx1 lineage of telencephalic progenitors generating cerebral cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PP4cflox/flox;Emx1Cre (PP4cfl/fl;Emx1Cre) mice died shortly after birth. Histological analysis of PP4cfl/fl;Emx1Cre brains showed global reduced cerebral cortex and brain size compared to heterozygous control brains PP4cfl/+;Emx1Cre (Ctr) (Figure S2). During development, cortical layers form in an “inside-out” fashion and deep layers are composed of early-born neurons, while superficial layers are composed of later-born neurons (Rakic, 2009Rakic P. Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The cortical layers of E18.5 PP4cfl/fl;Emx1Cre brains were thinner and more disorganized than their control counterparts (Figure 1). Brn2-positive neurons, which are produced during late neurogenesis and form the upper cortical layers II-III, did not form a cohesive layer in the cortex of PP4cfl/fl;Emx1Cre brains. Some Brn2-positive neurons are found even in the deep cortical layers (Figures 1E and 1H). Layer V neurons, produced around the peak of neurogenesis (Molyneaux et al., 2007Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Menezes J.R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) and positive for Ctip2, were dispersed throughout the cortex in PP4c-deficient brains (Figures 1F and 1I). In contrast, the majority of neurons in the cerebral cortex of PP4cfl/fl;Emx1Cre brains are Tbr1 positive, although they are not organized into a cohesive layer (Figures 1G and 1J). Thus, PP4c is required in RGPs at the onset of neurogenesis for proper cortical layer formation. To identify the cellular basis for the layering defect, we examined neuronal differentiation by immunostaining for the early neuronal marker Tuj1. At E11.5, shortly after Emx1Cre activation, we did not observe any obvious differences in neuronal differentiation between heterozygous control and PP4c mutant mouse brains (Figures 2A and 2D ). At E12.5, however, more neurons were generated in the mutants when compared to control brains (Figures 2B and 2E). This phenotype is even stronger at E13.5 when almost the entire cortex including the VZ and SVZ is occupied by differentiated neurons in mutant mice (Figure 2F), while only a few neurons in the cortical plate are seen in controls (Figure 2C). To examine whether supernumerary neurons are generated at the expense of progenitors, we stained control and mutant brain sections for phospho-Histone H3 (PH3) to mark mitotic progenitors. At E11.5, the numbers of PH3-positive progenitors in mutant and control brains were comparable (Figures 2G, 2J, and 2M). At E12.5, however, the number of mitotic progenitors was significantly reduced in the mutant brains and this effect became even stronger at E13.5 (Figures 2H, 2I, 2K, 2L, and 2M). When we examined the number of Pax6-positive RGPs and Tbr2-positive BPs, we found that both types of progenitors were depleted in the PP4c mutant brains (Figures 2N–2S). Interestingly, loss of PP4c seems to have stronger effects on Tbr2-positive BPs (37.5% of control) compared to Pax6-positive RGPs (67.5% of control). The reduction in BP cell number could be an indirect consequence of the reduction in RGPs, although we cannot rule out that PP4c directly regulates BPs. To test whether the observed generation of supernumerary neurons correlates with increased cell-cycle exit, we labeled cycling progenitors by EdU incorporation at E12.5 and stained for the proliferation marker Ki67 24 hr later, at E13.5. Cells that have exited the cell cycle during those 24 hr are expected to be EdU positive but Ki67 negative. Indeed, we found that more cells exit the cell cycle in PP4c-deficient brains (22.08%) compared to control brains (11.65%) (Figures 2T–2V). Thus, our data demonstrate that PP4c is necessary to prevent neuronal differentiation and maintain the progenitor pool during the early stages of mouse cortical development. As PP4c is concentrated at centrosomes (Figure 1), we tested whether the defects observed in the knockout mice are due to spindle morphology or orientation defects in cortical progenitor cells. Tubulin staining demonstrated that the overall morphology of mitotic spindles in cortical progenitors is unaffected (Figures S3A–SH). In addition, the number of centrosomes was not altered obviously in PP4c mutant brains (Figures S3I–SL). Using established methodology (Figures S3M–SO) (Postiglione et al., 2011Postiglione M.P. Jüschke C. Xie Y. Haas G.A. Charalambous C. Knoblich J.A. Mouse inscuteable induces apical-basal spindle orientation to facilitate intermediate progenitor generation in the developing neocortex.Neuron. 2011; 72: 269-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we determined the orientation of mitotic spindles in wild-type and PP4c mutant cortical progenitors in three dimensions (3D) (Figure 3A). Spindle orientation was analyzed at E11.5 to avoid indirect effects from the cell-fate transformations observed at E12.5. Brain sections were stained for PH3 (to mark mitotic progenitors), γ-Tubulin (for centrosomes), and N-Cadherin (to outline cells). Only cells in ana- or early telophase were analyzed. In control brains, nearly 90% of the mitotic spindles are between 0° and 15° relative to the ventricular surface and only 10% are between 15° and 30° (Figure 3B). This is consistent with previous studies, although the method of spindle orientation measurement is different (Haydar et al., 2003Haydar T.F. Ang Jr., E.J. Rakic P.

In PP4c knockout brains, however, only 43.2% of the spindles are between 0° and 15°, 27.1% are between 15° and 30°, and 27% are between 30° and 60°; 2.7% of the mitotic spindles are between 60° and 90°, a close to vertical orientation that we never observed in controls (Figure 3B). Statistical analysis indicates that these defects are highly significant (Figure 3C). Thus, PP4c is essential for proper horizontal spindle orientation during the early phases of cortical development. Previous experiments have demonstrated that altering spindle orientation in neuroepithelial cells results in widespread apoptosis and led to the conclusion that spindle orientation is essential for neuroepithelial cell survival (Yingling et al., 2008Yingling J. Youn Y.H. Darling D. Toyo-Oka K. Pramparo T. Hirotsune S. Wynshaw-Boris A.

Costaining those mice for lineage markers, however, shows that the vast majority of dying cells have neuronal identity, while progenitor cells are not affected (0.79% of Pax6-positive cells are positive for TUNEL, 2% of Tbr2-positive cells are positive for TUNEL, whereas nearly 90% of caspase-3-positive cells are neurons) (Figures 3D–3I). Thus, we propose that apoptosis is a secondary consequence of premature neurogenesis that might occur because neuronal survival factors might be missing at those early stages of cortical development. To ask whether PP4c is required for lineage specification throughout cortical development or only during a specific time window, we crossed PP4cflox/flox mice with a NestinCre line (Nes11Cre) to conditionally inactive PP4c in the forebrain at E11.5 (PP4cfl/fl;NesCre), 1 day later than Emx1Cre (Chou et al., 2009Chou S.J. Perez-Garcia C.G. Kroll T.T. O’Leary D.D. Lhx2 specifies regional fate in Emx1 lineage of telencephalic progenitors generating cerebral cortex.Nat.

Effects of canonical Wnt signaling on dorso-ventral specification of the mouse telencephalon.Dev. Biol. 2005; 279: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Immunostaining confirmed the loss of PP4c at E12.5 in PP4cfl/fl;NesCre brains, 1 day later compared to Emx1Cre-mediated PP4c depletion (Figure S4). Just like in earlier embryos, we detected profound and highly significant defects in the orientation of mitotic spindles in progenitor cells from those mice (Figures 4A and 4B ). While more than 50% of mitotic spindles are horizontal in controls, this number is strongly decreased and the number of oblique and vertical spindles increased in PP4cfl/fl;NesCre mice. Surprisingly, however, randomization of spindle orientation at this later stage of development does not result in the abnormal cortical organization observed at earlier stages. Both superficial layer and deep layer neurons are generated and positioned correctly (Figures 4C–4H) and the drastic reduction in progenitor numbers observed in PP4cfl/fl;Emx1Cre is no longer observed (data not shown). Thus, our results define a critical time period within cortical development (E10.5–E12.5), during which planar orientation of mitotic spindles mediated by PP4c maintains symmetric divisions of cortical progenitors. Proliferative symmetric division of progenitors during this time is crucial for cortical organization and correct cortical layering. Previous experiments have shown that PP4c can dephosphorylate Ndel1, a Lis1 binding partner that is localized at centrosomes (Toyo-oka et al., 2008Toyo-oka K. Mori D. Yano Y. Shiota M. Iwao H.

Recent years have seen intensive efforts to exploit the P450s' ability to catalyze regio- and stereoselective oxidations of substrates to make biotechnologically useful products. Examples include the rational engineering of the Pseudomonas putida camphor hydroxylase P450cam (CYP101A1) for improved binding and oxidation of environmentally recalcitrant polychlorinated benzenes, and the use of directed evolution for the conversion of specificity of the Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3 (CYP102A1, BM3) from long chain fatty acids toward short chain hydrocarbons (3.Xu F.

In the latter case, an aim is to engineer BM3 to generate high levels of metabolites typical of those formed by human P450s. Approaches to engineering BM3 have included directed evolution, chimeragenesis (with homologs from Bacillus subtilis) and CASTing, as well as structure-led mutagenesis guided by x-ray crystal structures of BM3's P450 (heme) domain in substrate-free (SF), fatty acid-bound (SB), and various mutant forms (7.Ravichandran K.G.

Many studies identified common residues that help facilitate substrate diversification. These include Phe-87, Ala-82, Val-78, and Arg-47, the first three of which are internal residues, whereas Arg-47 interacts with the fatty acid carboxylate at the protein surface (6.Noble M.A. Miles C.S.

Rev. 2012; 41: 1218-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phe-87 interacts with the ω-end of fatty acids and prevents oxidation at this position. Phe-87 mutations alter regioselectivity of fatty acid oxidation, with positions of hydroxylation of lauric acid moving from ω-1/ω-2/ω-3 (WT BM3) toward ω-5 in F87A, F87S, and F87G point mutants, and even further from the ω-position in a F87A/V78A double mutant (6.Noble M.A. Miles C.S.

Regio- and stereoselectivity of P450-catalysed hydroxylation of steroids controlled by laboratory evolution.Nat. Chem. 2011; 3: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Although alterations that influence local structure in the BM3 active site cavity clearly have potential to alter the binding position of fatty acids and to enable docking of novel substrates, other BM3 mutations were shown to have more profound effects on the P450's conformational landscape (18.Whitehouse C.J. Yang W. Yorke J.A. Rowlatt B.C. Strong A.J. Blanford C.F. Bell S.G. Bartlam M. Wong L.L. Rao Z.

Chem. 2004; 279: 23287-23293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One of the more common activity-altering BM3 mutants (A82F) shows greatly enhanced affinity for fatty acid substrates. Although the crystal structure of palmitate-bound A82F heme domain was solved in the SB-type conformation (20.Huang W.-C. Westlake A.C. Maréchal J.D. Joyce M.G. Moody P.C. Roberts G.C. Filling a hole in cytochrome P450 BM3 improves substrate binding and catalytic efficiency.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), this did not provide a clear rationale for its much improved affinity for fatty acids. Also, despite several studies involving mutagenesis of BM3 to improve its capacity to oxidize human pharmaceuticals, there are no structural data to provide insight into how improved mutants enable binding of the new substrates or to guide subsequent engineering to further enhance binding and desired activities. In this study we characterize the structural and biochemical/catalytic properties of the A82F, F87V, and F87V/A82F mutants of BM3, demonstrating a novel activity in oxidation of the widely used gastric proton pump inhibitor (PPI) omeprazole (Fig. 1) and generating products typical of those formed by the major human metabolizing P450 enzyme CYP2C19 (21.Ibeanu G.C. Ghanayem B.I. Linko P. Li L. Pederson L.G. Goldstein J.A. Identification of residues 99, 220, and 221 of human cytochrome P450 2C19 as key determinants of omeprazole activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12496-12501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Structural data for substrate-free and omeprazole-bound forms of the A82F and double mutant BM3 heme domains provide clear evidence for the gatekeeper nature of the A82F mutation, which produces a major structural rearrangement of the BM3 heme domain that leads to novel molecular selectivity. These first structural data for BM3 in complex with a human drug substrate highlight how combinations of conformational effector mutations (e.g. A82F) with secondary mutations that make local structural changes to alter binding in the heme vicinity (e.g. F87A/V) can be combined to cause dramatic changes in P450 substrate selectivity for biotechnological applications. Mutants of the intact P450 BM3 and its heme domain were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Intact WT P450 BM3 in pET15b was used for mutagenesis to create A82F, F87V, and F87V/A82F (DM) mutants. Mutations (positions underlined) were generated using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene-Agilent UK). Primers used were as follows: A82F, 5′-CTTAAATTTGTACGTGATTTTTTCGGAGACGGGTTA-3′; F87V, 5′-TTGCAGGAGACGGGTTAGTTACAAGCTGGACGCATG-3′; F87V in A82F background, 5′-TTTTCGGAGACGGGTTAGTTACAAGCTGGACGCATG-3′ (and their reverse complements). These intact BM3 enzymes were expressed as N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged enzymes either using the pET15b (F87V, DM) constructs directly or following cloning of the WT and A82F genes into pET14b using NdeI/BamHI sites. WT and mutant heme domain genes were generated using the relevant pET14b/15b constructs. To generate the heme domain constructs, a stop codon pair (underlined) was introduced after residue 473 by PCR using the same mutagenesis kit, and with primers StopF 5′-CAGTCTGCTAAAAAAGTACGCAAATAGTAGGAAAACGCTCATAATACGCCGCTG-3′ and StopR 5′-CAGCGGCGTATTATGAGCGTTTTCCTACTATTTGCGTACTTTTTTAGCAGACTG-3′. The heme domain genes (amino acids 1–473) were transferred as NdeI/BamHI fragments to pET20b to enable heme domain production in the absence of an N-terminal His tag for improved crystallization. Genes were sequenced to ensure the presence of desired mutation(s) and the absence of other mutations. The WT and A82F intact BM3 and the WT and all mutant P450 BM3 heme domain proteins were expressed in BL21-Gold (DE3) Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene-Agilent UK) using TB medium with cell growth at 37 °C and with agitation at 200 rpm in an orbital incubator. The F87V and DM intact BM3 proteins were grown in autoinduction TB medium (Melford Ltd., Ipswich, UK). Typically, 4-liter bacterial cultures were used for protein production with cell growth for 24–36 h. Following cell growth, bacterial cells were recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C (6000 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in ice-cold buffer B (50 mm KPi, 250 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.0) containing protease inhibitors (EDTA-free CompleteTM tablets, Roche Applied Science). Protease inhibitors were maintained in all subsequent buffers used for protein purification. Cells were lysed by sonication on ice using a Bandelin Sonopuls sonicator (40% power, 50 pulses for 5 s with 25 s between pulses). The supernatant containing soluble intact BM3 and heme domain proteins was separated from cell debris by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 40 min, 4 °C), and ammonium sulfate was added to 30% saturation on ice with slow stirring for ∼4 h. Centrifugation (20,000 × g, 40 min, 4 °C) was done to fractionate soluble BM3 and heme domain proteins from insoluble material. Intact BM3 WT and mutant proteins in the supernatant were purified using His tag affinity by mixing with nickel-iminodiacetic acid (Ni-IDA) resin (Qiagen, UK) overnight at 4 °C in buffer B with 5 mm imidazole, prior to elution with 200 mm imidazole in buffer B. Isolated proteins were dialyzed into buffer A (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Healthcare, 26 × 60 cm on an AKTA purifier system). BM3 fractions were checked for purity by SDS-PAGE, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Vivaspin, Vivaproducts), and frozen in buffer A plus 50% glycerol at −80 °C. For the nontagged BM3 heme domains, supernatants subsequent to the 30% ammonium sulfate fractionation were subjected to a second ammonium sulfate fractionation step at 60% salt saturation. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A and extensively dialyzed into the same buffer to desalt, prior to loading onto a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (16 × 10 cm, on an AKTA) and eluting using a gradient of 0–500 mm KCl in buffer A. Heme domain-containing fractions were desalted by using a desalting column (GE Healthcare, 26 × 10 cm on an AKTA) into 25 mm KPi, pH 7.0, and then loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad, 16 × 11 cm) and eluted in a linear gradient of 25–500 mm KPi, pH 7.0 (200 ml). Pure heme domain fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Vivaspin) and used immediately for crystallography or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Because of the enhanced affinity for fatty acids in BM3 and heme domain proteins carrying the A82F mutation, all enzymes were passed through a Lipidex 1000 column (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 25 mm KPi, pH 7.0, to remove any fatty acid bound during purification and prior to use for crystallization (heme domains) or for binding or turnover studies (heme domain and intact BM3 enzymes). Concentrations of the low spin forms of the WT and mutant forms of intact P450 BM3 and its heme domain were determined using extinction coefficients of ϵ = 105 and 95 mm−1 cm−1, respectively, at the Soret maximum (418 or 419 nm), as described previously (6.Noble M.A. Miles C.S.

Thiolate coordination of the heme iron in all samples was established by formation of the Fe(II)CO complex at ∼450 nm by bubbling of sodium dithionite-reduced WT and mutant BM3 and heme domain samples (∼2–4 μm) with carbon monoxide gas, as described by Omura and Sato (22.Omura T.

All samples showed near complete conversion to the P450 form, with negligible formation of an ∼420-nm peak relating to the thiol-coordinated P420 form (23.Perera R. Sono M. Sigman J.A. Pfister T.D.

Dissociation constants (Kd values) for binding of the substrates N-palmitoylglycine (NPG) and omeprazole (OMP) to WT and mutant BM3 heme domains were determined by UV-visible absorption titrations using ∼1–4 μm protein in 100 mm KPi, pH 7.0, at 25 °C (assay buffer) in 1-cm path length quartz cuvettes and as in our previous studies (6.Noble M.A. Miles C.S.

Spectra were recorded for substrate-free enzymes and following addition of ligands during substrate titrations (typically 800 to 250 nm). Titrations were recorded until no further spectral changes were observed in the P450s. Difference spectra were generated by subtraction of the spectrum for ligand-free protein from spectra recorded after each addition of substrate. Maxima and minima in difference spectra were identified (using the same wavelength pair in each titration), and the overall absorbance changes Δ(Apeak minus Atrough) were plotted versus [substrate]. Data were fitted using either a standard (Michaelis-Menten) hyperbolic function or (for tight binding substrates where the Kd value is ≤5× the P450 concentration) by using the Morrison equation (as described previously) to determine Kd values (26.Morrison J.F.

UV-visible spectroscopy was carried out on a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrometer (Cary-Agilent, UK), with data analysis and fitting done using Origin Pro software (OriginLab). Steady-state kinetic parameters for WT and F87V, A82F, and DM mutants of intact BM3 were analyzed on a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer using substrate (OMP and NPG)-dependent NADPH oxidation at 340 nm (Δϵ340 = 6210 m−1 cm−1) across a range of substrate concentrations and using pure BM3 enzymes (25–125 nm) in a total of 1 ml of assay buffer at 25 °C. NADPH was maintained at a saturating concentration (200 μm). Data points were collected in at least triplicate. Rate constants for substrate-dependent NADPH oxidation were plotted versus [substrate], and data were fitted using the Michaelis-Menten function (using Origin Pro) to obtain kcat and Km parameters in each case. Vmax values for WT and mutant BM3 enzymes with 5-OH OMP were measured similarly using a saturating concentration of the metabolite. Turnover reactions for oxidation of OMP were carried out in deep well blocks at 37 °C with shaking for 30 min. Reaction mixtures contained purified WT or mutant (F87V, A82F, or DM BM3) enzymes (0.1 μm), substrate (10 μm), and NADPH regeneration system (glucose 6-phosphate 7.76 mm, NADP+ 0.6 mm, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.75 units/ml) in turnover buffer (50 mm KPi, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) in a final volume of 500 μl. Following completion of the reaction, protein was precipitated by addition of an equal volume of acetonitrile containing 1 μg/ml fluconazole by shaking the mixed samples at 800 rpm for 10 min. The precipitated protein was filtered through protein precipitation plates (Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK) into mass spectrometry vials (FluidX, Nether Alderley, UK) and clarified by centrifugation (4000 × g, 25 min, 10 °C). Analysis was carried out on a Thermo Exactive LC-MS with a CTC PAL autosampler (Thermo Scientific, UK) with a Kinetex 2.6U XB-C18 100A column (Phenomenex). A gradient of 0.1% formic acid to acetonitrile was used to resolve products. Reaction of the DM BM3 enzyme with 5-OH OMP and subsequent product analysis were done in the same way as for the OMP turnovers. Turnover reactions with OMP were carried out in a 100-ml flask at 37 °C with shaking of reagents at 100 rpm for 30 min. Reaction mixtures contained purified WT or mutant (F87V, A82F, or DM intact BM3) enzymes (1 μm), substrate (100 μm), NADPH regeneration system (glucose 6-phosphate 7.76 mm, NADP+ 0.6 mm, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 0.75 units/ml) in 60 ml of assay buffer (100 mm KPi, pH 7.0). Products were extracted using Strata-X SPE columns (Phenomenex), dried under vacuum, and eluted in CDCl3. Analysis was carried out on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz NMR (Bruker, Coventry, UK). 1H spectra were collected at 400 MHz and 13C spectra at 101 MHz. Spectra were base-line corrected and referenced to tetramethylsilane standard by the residual nondeuterated solvent in the sample. δ values are in ppm;, J values are in Hz. Full assignments were made by COSY, HMBC, and HMQC methods. Signal splittings were recorded as singlet (s), doublet (d), doublet of doublets (dd), αβ system (AB), and multiplet (m). Processing was carried out using MestReNova Lite (Mestrelab Research, Santiago de Compostela, Spain) and an NMR processor (Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc., Toronto, Canada). DSC was carried out on a Microcal VP-DSC instrument. Data analysis was done using Microcal Origin software. The parameters used were as follows: 20–80 °C temperature gradient, 90 °C/h scan rate, 10-min prescan thermostat. Background scans were carried out with degassed assay buffer and saturated with OMP or NPG for the substrate-bound samples. Protein samples were prepared in assay buffer by extensive buffer exchange and dialysis. All samples were run using 20 μm protein and saturating substrate. Once two overlapping base-line scans were achieved, a degassed protein sample was run. Crystallography was performed using the sitting drop method using a seeding protocol at 4 °C. Crystals obtained during initial screens for each mutant were used to create microcrystal screen stocks, and consecutive screens (Molecular Dimensions) were made with drops that consisted of 150 nl of WT or mutant heme domain proteins (230 μm), 50 μl of seed stock, and 200 nl of well solution using a Mosquito liquid handling robot (TTP LabTech Ltd., Melbourn, UK). For the OMP mutant heme domain complex structures, proteins were saturated with racemic OMP ligand prior to crystallization. Ligands were titrated into heme domain samples until no further change in heme iron spin state (toward high spin) was observed. Thereafter, samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration in the presence of saturating ligand. Micro seeding was also used to produce diffraction quality crystals. Crystals were obtained under a range of conditions and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. The mother liquor was supplemented with 10% PEG 200 where an additional cryo-protectant was required. Data were collected at Diamond synchrotron beamlines and reduced and scaled using XDS (28.Kabsch W.

The quantum analog of this effect has been predicted to appear in the low-temperature A phase of 3 He, where the Cooper pairs forming the superfluid have a specific handedness. An impurity traveling through such a superfluid would experience a deflecting force in the direction determined by the chirality of the pairs. Ikegami et al. (p. 59 ) trapped impurities beneath the free surface of 3 He, set them in motion, and demonstrated the existence of this deflecting force by measuring the differential transverse current. The sign of the deflection varied over different cooling runs, indicating that the system was choosing one or the other chirality upon entering the superfluid phase—a signature of spontaneous symmetry breaking."

However, an understanding of the mechanisms by which phosphorylation exerts its effects is lacking. Here, we test the hypothesis that phosphorylation regulates Cx43 gap junction intercellular communication by mediating structural changes in the C-terminal domain. Circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to characterize the effects of phosphorylation on the secondary structure and backbone dynamics of soluble and membrane-tethered Cx43CT domains. Cx43CT phospho-mimetic isoforms, which have Asp substitutions at specific Ser/Tyr sites, revealed phosphorylation alters the α-helical content of the Cx43CT domain only when attached to the membrane. The changes in secondary structure are due to variations in the conformational preference and backbone flexibility of residues adjacent and distal to the site(s) of modification. In addition to the known direct effects of phosphorylation on molecular partner interactions, the data presented here suggest phosphorylation may also indirectly regulate binding affinity by altering the conformational preference of the Cx43CT domain."

Spontaneous neuronal activity pervades the developing nervous system and correlations contained in its patterns guide the synaptic refinement of many immature circuits (Blankenship and Feller, 2010Blankenship A.G.

This has best been studied in the developing visual system, where waves of spontaneous activity originate in the retina (Meister et al., 1991Meister M. Wong R.O. Baylor D.A. Shatz C.J.

Across many species, retinal waves mature in three stereotypic stages (I–III) (Blankenship and Feller, 2010Blankenship A.G. Feller M.B.

Retinal waves and visual system development.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 29-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In each stage, distinct mechanisms give rise to unique activity patterns that serve specific functions in organizing visual circuits. During stage III (postnatal day 10–14, P10–P14 mice), the firing patterns of different RGC types diverge (Lee et al., 2002Lee C.W. Eglen S.J. Wong R.O.

Changing patterns of spontaneous bursting activity of on and off retinal ganglion cells during development.Neuron. 1996; 16: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In particular, we recently discovered that within each stage III wave neighboring RGCs with opposite light responses fire asynchronous bursts of action potentials in a fixed order: ON before OFF (Kerschensteiner and Wong, 2008Kerschensteiner D.

A precisely timed asynchronous pattern of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell activity during propagation of retinal waves.Neuron. 2008; 58: 851-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence indicate that this activity pattern is critical for the segregation of ON and OFF retinogeniculate projections. First, ON/OFF segregation in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) emerges concurrent with stage III waves (Hahm et al., 1991Hahm J.O. Langdon R.B. Sur M.

Second, blockade of retinal activity or its transmission to dLGN neurons during this period prevents ON/OFF segregation (Cramer and Sur, 1997Cramer K.S. Sur M.

Third, mouse mutants with precocious stage III waves display excessive ON/OFF segregation (Chandrasekaran et al., 2007Chandrasekaran A.R. Shah R.D. Crair M.C.

Fourth, artificial neuronal networks with burst-time dependent plasticity rules similar to those found in subcortical visual circuits (Butts et al., 2007Butts D.A. Kanold P.O. Shatz C.J.

Eglen S.J. Burst-time-dependent plasticity robustly guides ON/OFF segregation in the lateral geniculate nucleus.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000618Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition to guiding refinement of dLGN circuits, the asynchronous activation of ON and OFF RGCs appears well suited to shape the emergence of ON/OFF domains and orientation selectivity in V1 (Jin et al., 2008Jin J.Z. Weng C. Yeh C.I. Gordon J.A. Ruthazer E.S. Stryker M.P. Swadlow H.A. Alonso J.M. On and off domains of geniculate afferents in cat primary visual cortex.Nat.

At the same time, distance-dependent correlations imposed by the lateral propagation of stage III waves and disjoint binocular RGC activity are needed to maintain retinotopic organization and eye-specific segregation of retinofugal projections (Chapman, 2000Chapman B.

The activation of RGCs during stage III waves is known to be mediated by glutamate receptors and a transient rise in extrasynaptic glutamate has been shown to accompany each wave (Blankenship et al., 2009Blankenship A.G. Ford K.J. Johnson J. Seal R.P. Edwards R.H. Copenhagen D.R. Feller M.B.

Developmental changes in the neurotransmitter regulation of correlated spontaneous retinal activity.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 351-360PubMed Google Scholar). However, the circuits that initiate and laterally propagate stage III waves, and desynchronize the activity of neighboring ON and OFF RGCs remain obscure. Here, we systematically combine dual patch-clamp recordings of morphologically identified neurons in the retina to elucidate the circuits and mechanisms that give rise to the unique activity patterns of stage III waves. We find that sequential spike bursts of ON and OFF RGCs are generated by consecutive glutamate release from ON and OFF CBCs. We identify and characterize crossover circuits involving diffuse glycinergic and GABAergic amacrine cells (ACs) through which ON CBCs hyperpolarize OFF CBCs to delay glutamate release and show that glutamate uptake, mediated at least in part by Mueller glia (MGs), is required for the separation of excitatory input to ON and OFF RGCs. In addition to vertical inhibitory networks, we discover two lateral excitatory circuit mechanisms that link ON CBCs and underlie stage III wave initiation and propagation. We began our investigation into the circuit mechanisms that generate and pattern stage III waves by obtaining dual whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from RGCs in flat-mounted P11–P13 retinas. To minimize distortions in the relative timing of activity introduced by lateral wave propagation, we targeted neighboring RGCs with overlapping dendritic territories (Figures 1A and 1B ; overlap: 59.4% ± 3.4%, mean ± SEM, n = 25). Current-clamp recordings showed, in agreement with previous studies (Blankenship et al., 2011Blankenship A.G. Hamby A.M. Firl A. Vyas S. Maxeiner S. Willecke K. Feller M.B. The role of neuronal connexins 36 and 45 in shaping spontaneous firing patterns in the developing retina.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9998-10008Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, Kerschensteiner and Wong, 2008Kerschensteiner D. Wong R.O. A precisely timed asynchronous pattern of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell activity during propagation of retinal waves.Neuron. 2008; 58: 851-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), that stage III waves often occur in clusters with multiple bursts of activity separated by prolonged periods of silence (Figure 1C). More importantly, these recordings confirmed our previous multielectrode-array-based observation that within each wave neighboring ON and OFF RGCs fire asynchronous bursts of action potentials in a fixed order: ON before OFF (Figures 1D and 1E; peak time of OFF-ON cross-correlation (PT): 755 ± 134 ms, mean ± SEM, n = 11) (Kerschensteiner and Wong, 2008Kerschensteiner D. Wong R.O. A precisely timed asynchronous pattern of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell activity during propagation of retinal waves.Neuron. 2008; 58: 851-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The spontaneous activity of RGCs of the same response sign (i.e., ON-ON or OFF-OFF), in contrast, is synchronized (PT: 25 ± 25 ms, n = 4; p < 0.01 for comparison to OFF-ON). The precise sequence of ON and OFF RGC spike bursts during glutamatergic waves could arise from distinctly timed excitatory and/or inhibitory inputs to these cells, differences in their intrinsic excitability, or combinations thereof. To begin distinguishing among these possibilities we examined synaptic inputs to RGCs during stage III waves. Voltage-clamp recordings at the reversal potential for inhibitory conductances (−60 mV) revealed sequential excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in ON and OFF RGCs. The timing of EPSCs matched the spike patterns of these neurons during waves (Figures 1F and 1G; OFF-ON PT: control: 698 ± 42 ms, n = 15; same sign PT: 3.5 ± 16 ms, n = 10; p < 10−4). From here on, we will refer to the distinct periods of each wave during which ON and OFF RGCs receive excitation (and spike) as the wave’s ON and OFF phases, respectively. Unlike EPSCs, inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) of ON and OFF RGCs recorded at the reversal potential for excitatory conductances (0 mV) were synchronized similar to those of same sign RGCs (Figures 1H and 1I; OFF-ON PT: −27 ± 36 ms, n = 7; same sign PT: −44 ± 22 ms, n = 7; p > 0.8). To determine whether RGCs receive inhibition during the ON and/or OFF phase of stage III waves, we simultaneously recorded EPSCs in ON RGCs and IPSCs in OFF RGCs (Figure 1J). The coincidence of these inputs (Figure 1K; PT: 2.6 ± 9.3 ms, n = 8) suggests that inhibition to both OFF and ON RGCs is driven by the same circuit elements that provide excitatory input to ON RGCs. As a result, ON RGCs receive simultaneous excitation and inhibition, whereas inhibition precedes excitation for OFF RGCs. In addition to differences in their timing, the relative weights of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances were reversed between ON and OFF RGCs (Figure 1K, inset; ON ginh/gexc: 0.67 ± 0.09, n = 25 cells; OFF ginh/gexc: 2.35 ± 0.26, n = 31 cells; p < 10−7). Because synaptic inhibition precedes excitation in OFF RGCs, postinhibitory rebound could contribute to their firing (Margolis and Detwiler, 2007Margolis D.J. Detwiler P.B. Different mechanisms generate maintained activity in ON and OFF retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5994-6005Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To compare the importance of rebound depolarizations to those mediated by synaptic excitation, we recorded OFF RGC responses to somatic current injections (see Figure S1 available online). Even for current steps (−150 pA) that hyperpolarized OFF RGCs (−102.6 ± 8.3 mV, n = 7 cells) well below the likely reversal potential for inhibitory conductances at this age (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang L.L. Pathak H.R. Coulter D.A. Freed M.A. Vardi N. Shift of intracellular chloride concentration in ganglion and amacrine cells of developing mouse retina.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 2404-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), only two of seven cells fired rebound spikes. Moreover, when observed, rebound firing gave rise to only few action potentials compared to the robust spike bursts elicited by depolarizing current injections (Figure S1) and observed during waves (Figures 1C and 1D). Responses of ON RGCs to current injections were similar to those of OFF RGCs (Figure S1). Thus, it appears that the offset bursts of ON and OFF RGCs are elicited by sequential excitatory inputs to these neurons, which in the case of ON RGCs outweigh simultaneous inhibitory inputs and in the case of OFF RGCs are preceded by inhibition. Several studies have shown that excitatory input to RGCs during stage III waves is mediated by glutamate and recent reports identify BCs as its likely source (Blankenship et al., 2009Blankenship A.G. Ford K.J. Johnson J. Seal R.P. Edwards R.H. Copenhagen D.R. Feller M.B.

Developmental changes in the neurotransmitter regulation of correlated spontaneous retinal activity.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 351-360PubMed Google Scholar). However, how BCs themselves respond during waves is not well understood. To address this question and elucidate the mechanisms that offset excitatory inputs to ON and OFF RGCs, we obtained dual whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from BCs and RGCs with overlapping neurite territories in P11–P13 retinal flat mount preparations (Figures 2A and 2B ). The dendrites of BCs contact either rod (RBCs) or cone (CBCs) photoreceptors. All CBCs (43/43 cells) but no RBCs (0/4 cells) we recorded participated in stage III waves. Like RGCs, CBCs can be grouped into ON and OFF classes. The axons of ON CBCs stratify in the inner 3/5 of the IPL, those of OFF CBCs in the outer 2/5 where they contact the dendrites of ON and OFF RGCs, respectively (Ghosh et al., 2004Ghosh K.K. Bujan S. Haverkamp S. Feigenspan A. Wässle H. Types of bipolar cells in the mouse retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 469: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Simultaneous recordings of ON CBCs and ON RGCs revealed that during each stage III wave, ON CBCs depolarize while their membrane potential remains relatively stable between waves (Figure 2C; VRest: −59.4 ± 1.6 mV, n = 27). The timing and shape of ON CBC depolarizations matched those of concurrently recorded ON RGC EPSCs (Figures 2D and 2E; PT: 56 ± 43 ms, n = 18). In contrast, OFF CBCs hyperpolarize during each stage III wave and rest at higher membrane potentials in between (Figure 2F; VRest: −48.4 ± 2.4 mV, n = 16 cells, p < 10−3 for comparison to ON CBCs). The timing of the respective events, similar to depolarizations of ON CBCs, was aligned with the ON phase of each wave (Figure 2G; trough time of cross-correlation: 52 ± 194 ms, n = 10). To further quantify voltage changes in ON and OFF CBCs, we algorithmically detected waves (Experimental Procedures) and subtracted from the voltage extremum during a wave its average value before and after. Voltage excursions of ON and OFF CBCs measured in this way had similar amplitudes but opposite signs (Figure 2H; ON CBCs: 13.1 ± 1 mV, n = 27; OFF CBCs: −12.6 ± 1.6 mV, n = 16, p < 10−7). This was true irrespective of whether waves were detected based on the CBC voltage itself or on simultaneously recorded excitation to RGCs (Figure S2). To explicitly test the concurrence of CBC voltage fluctuations with stage III waves, we compared the probability with which RGC EPSCs coincided with CBC depolarizations (ON) or hyperpolarizations (OFF) in recorded traces to simulations in which the timing of CBC events was randomly shifted. In each case, the coincidence of CBC and RGC events was significantly higher in the recorded than in the randomized traces (Figure 2I, observed: 71% ± 2%, random 17% ± 1%, n = 39, p < 10−7). Since RGC EPSCs at this age were shown to be largely restricted to waves (Blankenship et al., 2009Blankenship A.G. Ford K.J. Johnson J. Seal R.P. Edwards R.H. Copenhagen D.R. Feller M.B. Synaptic and extrasynaptic factors governing glutamatergic retinal waves.Neuron. 2009; 62: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), it follows that the CBC voltage fluctuations we discover here are as well. Events detected only in RGC or CBC traces most likely reflect waves propagating along paths that included most of the neurites of one but not the other neuron recorded. Thus, ON CBCs excite ON RGCs as they depolarize during the ON phase of stage III waves, whereas OFF CBCs, instead of depolarizing during the OFF phase of waves, hyperpolarize during the ON phase and release glutamate onto OFF RGCs as their voltage returns to baseline. To probe the mechanisms that hyperpolarize OFF CBCs, we carried out voltage-clamp recordings from these cells. In doing so, we observed large IPSCs in OFF CBCs that coincided with EPSCs in simultaneously recorded ON RGCs (Figures 3A and 3B ; PT: 30 ± 98 ms, n = 7). Importantly, the inhibitory inputs to OFF CBCs far outweighed coinciding excitatory ones (Figures 3C and S4C; ginh/gexc: 7.56 ± 1.43, n = 11). Previous results suggest that glycine and GABA receptors mediate inhibition to OFF CBCs at this age (Schubert et al., 2008Schubert T. Kerschensteiner D. Eggers E.D. Misgeld T. Kerschensteiner M. Lichtman J.W. Lukasiewicz P.D. Wong R.O. Development of presynaptic inhibition onto retinal bipolar cell axon terminals is subclass-specific.J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 100: 304-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we found that while strychnine (500 nM) alone was sufficient to suppress most wave-associated OFF CBC hyperpolarizations (Figures 3D and 3E), blockade of both glycinergic and GABAergic transmission (strychnine 500 nM, gabazine 5 μM, TPMPA 50 μM) was needed to depolarize OFF CBCs during stage III waves (Figures 3D and 3E; control: −13.8 ± 2.1 mV; −Gly: −0.2 ± 3.1 mV; −Gly −GABAA/C: 7.0 ± 2.7 mV, n = 6; p < 0.03 for all comparisons). Blockade of inhibition had no effect on the amplitude of voltage fluctuations in ON CBCs (control: 16.1 ± 2.9 mV; −Gly −GABAA/C: 15.5 ± 4.3 mV, n = 5; p > 0.8), but raised the frequency of waves in both ON and OFF CBCs (Figure S3; control: 0.082 ± 0.008 Hz; −Gly −GABAA/C: 0.238 ± 0.032 Hz, n = 11, p < 10−3). From these results, we conclude that ON CBCs drive crossover inhibition onto both OFF RGC dendrites and OFF CBC axon terminals. This inhibition involves glycinergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission and overwhelms synchronous excitatory inputs to OFF CBCs. To identify the cells that mediate crossover inhibition, we obtained dual recordings from ACs and RGCs during stage III waves. ACs are a morphologically diverse class of inhibitory interneurons in the inner retina (MacNeil and Masland, 1998MacNeil M.A. Masland R.H. Extreme diversity among amacrine cells: implications for function.Neuron. 1998; 20: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). For our experiments, we targeted ACs with diffusely stratified neurites that are well positioned to convey signals between ON and OFF CBCs in the IPL (Figures 4A and 4B ). In agreement with previous studies, we found that most diffuse ACs had narrow to medium-sized lateral fields (territory: 960 ± 227 μm2, n = 14) (MacNeil and Masland, 1998MacNeil M.A. Masland R.H. Extreme diversity among amacrine cells: implications for function.Neuron. 1998; 20: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, Menger et al., 1998Menger N. Pow D.V. Wässle H. Glycinergic amacrine cells of the rat retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 401: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Uniformly, these ACs depolarized from rest during stage III waves (Figures 4C and 4D; VRest: −55.1 ± 3.3 mV, ΔVoltage: 14.9 ± 1.6 mV, n = 18). Simultaneous recordings of EPSCs in ON RGCs or IPSCs in OFF RGCs demonstrated that AC depolarizations occurred during the ON phase of each wave (Figures 4E and 4F; PT: 33 ± 51 ms, n = 9) and voltage-clamp recordings revealed correlated EPSCs in diffuse ACs and ON RGCs (Figures 4G and 4H; PT: 19 ± 46 ms, n = 5). Thus, it appears that during the ON phase of stage III waves ON CBCs release glutamate and depolarize glycinergic and GABAergic diffuse ACs, which crossover inhibit OFF CBCs and OFF RGCs. If delayed excitation and bursting of OFF RGCs depend on crossover inhibition of OFF CBCs by diffuse ACs, as we suggest, then blockade of inhibition, which inverts the responses of OFF CBCs, should advance excitatory inputs and spike bursts of OFF RGCs to the ON phase of stage III waves. Voltage- and current-clamp recordings from neighboring ON and OFF RGCs in the presence of strychnine, gabazine and TPMPA showed that indeed blocking glycine, GABAA and GABAC receptors synchronized EPSCs (Figures 5A and 5B ; control: 698 ± 42 ms, n = 15; −Gly −GABAA/C: 68 ± 42 ms, n = 4, p < 0.005) and spike trains (Figure S5; control: 755 ± 134 ms, n = 11; −Gly −GABAA/C: 40 ± 68 ms, n = 5, p < 0.005) of OFF and ON RGCs (Kerschensteiner and Wong, 2008Kerschensteiner D. Wong R.O. A precisely timed asynchronous pattern of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell activity during propagation of retinal waves.Neuron. 2008; 58: 851-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To maintain temporal separation of the excitatory inputs to ON and OFF RGCs, the spread of extrasynaptic glutamate needs to be restricted to the distinct sublaminae in which their dendrites stratify. In support of a role for excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) in this process, we found that EPSCs in ON and OFF RGCs were synchronized by application of TBOA (25 μM) (Figures 5C and 5D; control: 698 ± 42 ms, n = 15; −EAAT: 31 ± 28 ms, n = 5, p < 0.002). Furthermore, dual patch-clamp recordings from MGs and RGCs showed that MGs depolarize during each neuronal wave (Figure S6; ΔVoltage: 1.26 ± 0.09 mV, n = 5), suggesting that EAAT-mediated glutamate uptake, which is known to be electrogenic (Owe et al., 2006Owe S.G. Marcaggi P. Attwell D. The ionic stoichiometry of the GLAST glutamate transporter in salamander retinal glia.J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), is performed at least in part by MGs. The experiments described so far define circuit mechanisms that offset the activity of ON and OFF RGCs and thus pattern glutamatergic waves. During these experiments, we found that ON CBCs depolarize in each wave and control the activity of downstream neurons. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which glutamatergic waves are initiated and propagated laterally, we focused next on how ON CBCs depolarize. Dual voltage-clamp recordings showed that ON CBCs receive excitatory inputs in phase with ON RGCs (Figures 6A and 6B ; PT: 28 ± 62 ms, n = 8). Surprisingly, for half of the ON CBCs (14/27 cells) the amplitude of wave-associated currents was similar at 0 mV and −60 mV. To better characterize the excitatory conductances of ON CBCs, we blocked inhibition and recorded wave-associated currents at a series of different holding potentials. ON CBCs studied in this way fell into two distinct groups. In the first group (I, 3/6 cells), the current amplitude relative to baseline was insensitive to the holding potential (Figures 6C and 6D). This behavior is expected if the recorded cells are coupled via gap junctions to neighboring neurons that depolarize during stage III waves. In the second group (II, 3/6 cells), wave-associated currents reversed near 0 mV (Figures 6E and 6F), indicative of cation-nonselective conductances. OFF CBCs (4/4) displayed similar current-voltage (I–V) relationships to group II ON CBCs (Figure S4). Given previously observed wave-associated increases in extrasynaptic glutamate in the IPL (Blankenship et al., 2009Blankenship A.G. Ford K.J. Johnson J. Seal R.P. Edwards R.H. Copenhagen D.R.

https://openalex.org/W2320035559,"Current models of tumor cell invasion propose that oncogenic signaling converges upon key orchestrators of cytoskeletal dynamics, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Jnk) and RhoGTPase family members; these signals dynamically direct Actin remodeling proteins (ARPs) to catalyze the cytoskeletal changes required for migration. Src is a key driver of tumor aggression, metastasis and patient mortality. To clarify how Src regulates Actin dynamics to promote invasive migration, we performed a genetic modifier screen in a Drosophila model of invasion. Nine genes linked to Actin dynamics were identified that mediate invasion in situ. We found that ARPs were required for many oncogenic effects of Src including Mmp1 expression and initiation of apoptosis. Surprisingly, they were also regulators of Jnk pathway activity: both Src and the small GTPase Rho1 activated Jnk in a manner dependent on ARPs during invasion. Our results suggest that ARPs are not simply downstream executors of signal transduction pathways. Rather, they participate in a positive feedback network involving canonical oncogenic signaling pathways that promote tumor invasion."

https://openalex.org/W2093557227,"Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are protection enzymes capable of conjugating glutathione (GSH) to toxic compounds. During evolution an important catalytic cysteine residue involved in GSH activation was replaced by serine or, more recently, by tyrosine. The utility of these replacements represents an enigma because they yield no improvements in the affinity toward GSH or in its reactivity. Here we show that these changes better protect the cell from nitric oxide (NO) insults. In fact the dinitrosyl·diglutathionyl·iron complex (DNDGIC), which is formed spontaneously when NO enters the cell, is highly toxic when free in solution but completely harmless when bound to GSTs. By examining 42 different GSTs we discovered that only the more recently evolved Tyr-based GSTs display enough affinity for DNDGIC (KD < 10(-9) M) to sequester the complex efficiently. Ser-based GSTs and Cys-based GSTs show affinities 10(2)-10(4) times lower, not sufficient for this purpose. The NO sensitivity of bacteria that express only Cys-based GSTs could be related to the low or null affinity of their GSTs for DNDGIC. GSTs with the highest affinity (Tyr-based GSTs) are also over-represented in the perinuclear region of mammalian cells, possibly for nucleus protection. On the basis of these results we propose that GST evolution in higher organisms could be linked to the defense against NO."

After initiation, RNAPII completes transcribing successfully at a fairly constant rate of 3–4 kb/min even in the case of an extraordinarily long (e.g. megabase) transcript. However, in some cases, transcribing RNAPII is subject to promoter-proximal pausing. In addition, subsequent to release from the promoter-proximal pause site, RNAPII is subject to frequent pausing, resulting in premature termination or inefficient elongation of nascent transcripts.

Elongin A contains an N-terminal region (residues 1–120) similar to the N terminus of SII that is dispensable for its elongation activity and a C-terminal elongation stimulatory domain that falls between residues 400 and 773 (25.Aso T.

Elongin A acts not only as a component of a transcript elongation factor but also as the substrate recognition subunit of an Elongin BC-containing ubiquitin ligase complex in which Elongins B and C link Elongin A to Cullin 5 and the RING finger protein Rbx2.

We previously carried out a comprehensive microarray analysis that revealed that expression of only a small fraction of genes (∼3–4%) is affected in Elongin A-deficient mouse ES cells, raising the possibility that Elongin A is not a global regulator of gene expression but rather controls the expression of select genes (28.Yamazaki K.

Mammalian elongin A is not essential for cell viability but is required for proper cell cycle progression with limited alteration of gene expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13585-13589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). More recently, we have generated Elongin A-deficient mice (29.Miyata K. Yasukawa T. Fukuda M.

Induction of apoptosis and cellular senescence in mice lacking transcription elongation factor, Elongin A.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 716-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and showed that Elongin A plays a crucial role in expression of a variety of genes for neural development (19.Yasukawa T. Bhatt S. Takeuchi T. Kawauchi J. Takahashi H. Tsutsui A. Muraoka T. Inoue M. Tsuda M. Kitajima S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Trainor P.A. Aso T. Transcriptional elongation factor Elongin A regulates retinoic acid-induced gene expression during neuronal differentiation.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We also observed that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Elongin A-null embryos displayed both increased apoptosis and senescence-like growth defects (29.Miyata K. Yasukawa T. Fukuda M. Takeuchi T. Yamazaki K. Sakumi K. Tamamori-Adachi M. Ohnishi Y. Ohtsuki Y. Nakabeppu Y. Kitajima S. Onishi S. Aso T. Induction of apoptosis and cellular senescence in mice lacking transcription elongation factor, Elongin A.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 716-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These phenotypes were accompanied by activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and p53, suggesting a possible role for Elongin A in stress responses. Typically, stress response genes must be activated rapidly in reaction to stimuli. To guarantee the swiftness of activation, RNAPIIs that are paused near the 5′-ends of genes are in a “poised” state. Increasing evidence indicates that release from this pausing is the rate-limiting step for the regulation of gene activation in vivo (30.Levine M. Paused RNA polymerase II as a developmental checkpoint.Cell. 2011; 145: 502-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). For example, P-TEFb (31.Lis J.T. Mason P. Peng J.

Furthermore, P-TEFb and NELF are implicated in epidermal growth factor-mediated c-fos (36.Yamada T. Yamaguchi Y. Inukai N. Okamoto S. Mura T. Handa H.

Transcriptional pausing caused by NELF plays a dual role in regulating immediate-early expression of the junB gene.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6094-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), respectively. However, functional details of Elongin A in in vivo stress response are still elusive. In this study, we explored further the role of Elongin A in stress responses. Our results provide evidence for a role for Elongin A in controlling expression of the leucine zipper transcription factor and stress response regulator activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). Arguing that Elongin A directly regulates ATF3 transcription, we show that it is recruited to the transcribed region of ATF3 gene in response to various stimuli. Furthermore, domains of Elongin A essential for maximal induction of the stress response were also identified. A mammalian expression plasmid vector, pCI-neo-hElongin A, was prepared by subcloning a human Elongin A cDNA containing an N-terminally tagged FLAG sequence between the NheI and XbaI sites of pCI-neo vector (Promega). Mammalian expression plasmids for rat Elongin A deletion mutants were as described (22.Yasukawa T. Sugimura K. Fukuda M. Yamazaki K. Kitajima S. Okumura K. Aso T.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-RNAPII (N-20), anti-TFIIE-α (C-17), and anti-FCP1 (C-16) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Leo1 (A300-175A) was purchased from Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. Rabbit anti-RAP74 antibody was prepared as described (13.Kitajima S. Chibazakura T. Yonaha M. Yasukochi Y. Regulation of the human general transcription initiation factor TFIIF by phosphorylation.J. Biol.

This antibody was highly specific in Western blots. Antibodies against Elongins B and C were kindly provided by Dr. Takumi Kamura (Nagoya University). Monoclonal anti-RNAPII (8WG16; Covance), anti-Ser2-phosphorylated form of the RNAPII C-terminal domain (CTD) (H5; Covance), anti-Ser5-phosphorylated form of the RNAPII CTD (H14; Covance), anti-TBP (Promega), anti-TFIIB (Promega), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) antibodies were used.

Other chemicals were reagent grade. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells treated as indicated were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% TritonX-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 200 μm sodium vanadate, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cells were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were taken as whole cell extract. Protein concentrations were measured by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as standard (39.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent.J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts (20 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, subjected to Western blotting, and detected using ImmunoCruz (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MEFs were prepared from E10.5 embryos as described (29.Miyata K. Yasukawa T. Fukuda M. Takeuchi T. Yamazaki K. Sakumi K. Tamamori-Adachi M. Ohnishi Y. Ohtsuki Y. Nakabeppu Y. Kitajima S. Onishi S.

Briefly, fetal tissue samples were rinsed in PBS and mechanically dissociated in DMEM with 10% FBS. All animal experiments were done with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care Committees of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University and Kochi Medical School. HeLa cells were transfected with pCI-neo-hElongin A using Superfect (Qiagen) and cultured in the presence of 800 μg/ml neomycin for 9 days. Drug-resistant clones were isolated and assayed for FLAG-tagged Elongin A expression using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blot. To establish cell lines expressing FLAG-RAP74, HeLa cells stably expressing mouse ecotropic retrovirus receptor were infected with retrovirus vector pMX-puro encoding FLAG-tagged human RAP74, and clonal cell lines positive for FLAG-RAP74 expression were selected in medium containing 20 μg/ml puromycin. Control or Elongin A-knocked down HeLa cells were treated as indicated. After treatment, total RNA was isolated by the acid-guanidinium method and assayed for mRNAs of various genes by quantitative RT-PCR using a kit from TaKaRa (Japan) as described (40.Hua B.

Accurate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in a soluble extract from isolated mammalian nuclei.Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Extracts were then incubated with 0.5 μg of anti-FLAG antibody or control IgG at 4 °C for 3 h in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, 80 mm NaCl or 150 mm NaCl followed by incubation with 30 μl of Protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h. The resulting immunocomplexes were washed with the same buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. Cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and 0.5% Triton-X for 20 min and then incubated with 100 mm glycine for 10 min. After blocking in PBS containing 3% BSA, cells were incubated with primary antibody at room temperature for 1.5 h or at 4 °C overnight, washed, and sequentially incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes). Cell nuclei were stained by treatment with DAPI (Nacalai Tesque). For in vivo RNA labeling, cells were incubated in the presence of 2 mm bromouridine at 37 °C for 20 min and then subjected to immunostaining using mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (Roche Applied Science). Images were captured with an LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For the evaluation of the colocalization, Pearson's correlation coefficient and van Steensel's cross-correlation coefficient (correlation coefficient and dx) were computed using ImageJ software with the JaCoP plug-in (42.van Steensel B. van Binnendijk E.P.

HeLa cells were transfected with piGENE-neo plasmids (Clontech) encoding siRNA sequences for human Elongin A under the control of the human tRNAVal gene promoter. After selection of cells with 800 μg/ml neomycin for 14 days, each colony was assayed for Elongin A expression by Western blot. Sequences for siRNAs that target nucleotides +1420 to 1439 (siElA6) and nucleotides 2216 to 2235 (siElA4) were 5′-AGgAAGGTGCtTGgTGTGTTCTTCCTGTCAAACACATCAGGCACCTTTCT-3′ and 5′-GtAGCAtTGTTTCtTATGgTCTTCCTGTCAATCATAGGAAACAGTGCTGC-3′, respectively. For rescue experiments, FLAG-tagged rat Elongin A was introduced into these cell lines by transfecting pcDNA3.1 vector encoding rat FLAG-Elongin A and selected by hygromycin. Elongin A knockdown and introduction of rescue constructs were also accomplished using retroviral vectors. Production of retrovirus vector using Plat E cells and pMX-puroII-U6 vector was described elsewhere (43.Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T.

https://openalex.org/W2089280499,"Microtubules are highly dynamic αβ-tubulin polymers. In vitro and in living cells, microtubules are most often cold- and nocodazole-sensitive. When present, the MAP6/STOP family of proteins protects microtubules from cold- and nocodazole-induced depolymerization but the molecular and structure determinants by which these proteins stabilize microtubules remain under debate. We show here that a short protein fragment from MAP6-N, which encompasses its Mn1 and Mn2 modules (MAP6(90-177)), recapitulates the function of the full-length MAP6-N protein toward microtubules, i.e. its ability to stabilize microtubules in vitro and in cultured cells in ice-cold conditions or in the presence of nocodazole. We further show for the first time, using biochemical assays and NMR spectroscopy, that these effects result from the binding of MAP6(90-177) to microtubules with a 1:1 MAP6(90-177):tubulin heterodimer stoichiometry. NMR data demonstrate that the binding of MAP6(90-177) to microtubules involve its two Mn modules but that a single one is also able to interact with microtubules in a closely similar manner. This suggests that the Mn modules represent each a full microtubule binding domain and that MAP6 proteins may stabilize microtubules by bridging tubulin heterodimers from adjacent protofilaments or within a protofilament. Finally, we demonstrate that Ca(2+)-calmodulin competes with microtubules for MAP6(90-177) binding and that the binding mode of MAP6(90-177) to microtubules and Ca(2+)-calmodulin involves a common stretch of amino acid residues on the MAP6(90-177) side. This result accounts for the regulation of microtubule stability in cold condition by Ca(2+)-calmodulin."

https://openalex.org/W2011977212,"In Ewing’s sarcoma family tumors (ESFTs), the proto-oncogene EWS that encodes an RNA-binding protein is fused by chromosomal translocation to the gene encoding one of the E-twenty six (ETS) family of transcription factors, most commonly friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI-1). Although EWS/FLI-1 chimeric proteins are necessary for carcinogenesis, additional events seem to be required for transformation to occur. We have previously reported that a protein product of an EWS mRNA target, whose expression is negatively regulated by EWS but not by EWS/FLI-1, contributes to ESFT development. However, the mechanism by which EWS represses protein expression remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that overexpression of full-length EWS repressed protein expression and induced nuclear retention of reporter mRNAs in a tethering assay. In contrast, when a mutant lacking the EWS C-terminal nuclear localization signal (classified as a PY-NLS) was expressed, reporter protein expression was upregulated, and the number of cells exporting reporter mRNA to the cytoplasm increased. EWS binds to the 3′-untranslated region in another mRNA target, cofilin 1 (CFL1), and negatively regulates the expression of CFL1. Overexpression of EWS induced nuclear retention of CFL1 mRNA. Furthermore, ESFT cell proliferation and metastatic potential were suppressed by small interfering RNA-mediated CFL1 knockdown. Together, our findings suggest that EWS induces nuclear retention of CFL1 mRNA, thereby suppressing expression of CFL1, and that CFL1 promotes development of ESFT. Targeting CFL1 might therefore provide another novel approach for treatment of this aggressive disease."
