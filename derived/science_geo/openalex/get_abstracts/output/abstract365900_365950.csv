Although effective and simple, the h-index suffers from some drawbacks that limit its use in accurately and fairly comparing the scientific output of different researchers. These drawbacks include information loss and low resolution: the former refers to the fact that in addition to h2 citations for papers in the h-core, excess citations are completely ignored, whereas the latter means that it is common for a group of researchers to have an identical h-index. Methodology/Principal Findings To solve these problems, I here propose the e-index, where e2 represents the ignored excess citations, in addition to the h2 citations for h-core papers. Citation information can be completely depicted by using the h-index together with the e-index, which are independent of each other. Some other h-type indices, such as a and R, are h-dependent, have information redundancy with h, and therefore, when used together with h, mask the real differences in excess citations of different researchers. Conclusions/Significance Although simple, the e-index is a necessary h-index complement, especially for evaluating highly cited scientists or for precisely comparing the scientific output of a group of scientists having an identical h-index."
https://openalex.org/W2007578481,"Strategies for allele-specific knockdown of the mutant genes in triplet-repeat disorders have relied on point or deletion mutations that differ among affected individuals. Hu et al. show that antisense oligomers can selectively recognize expanded CAG repeats in mRNAs, allowing silencing of mutant but not wild-type alleles. Expanded trinucleotide repeats1 cause many neurological diseases. These include Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)2 and Huntington's disease (HD)3, which are caused by expanded CAG repeats within an allele of the ataxin-3 (ATXN3) and huntingtin (HTT) genes, respectively. Silencing expression of these genes is a promising therapeutic strategy, but indiscriminate inhibition of both the mutant and wild-type alleles may lead to toxicity, and allele-specific approaches have required polymorphisms that differ among individuals. We report that peptide nucleic acid and locked nucleic acid antisense oligomers that target CAG repeats can preferentially inhibit mutant ataxin-3 and HTT protein expression in cultured cells. Duplex RNAs were less selective than single-stranded oligomers. The activity of the peptide nucleic acids does not involve inhibition of transcription, and differences in mRNA secondary structure or the number of oligomer binding sites may be important. Antisense oligomers that discriminate between wild-type and mutant genes on the basis of repeat length may offer new options for developing treatments for MJD, HD and related hereditary diseases."

The physiological relevance of this novel route, which represents a part of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, has not been directly established in vivo as yet. We have developed a method to quantify the fractional and absolute contributions of several cholesterol fluxes to total fecal neutral sterol loss in vivo in mice, by assessing the kinetics of orally and intravenously administered stable isotopically labeled cholesterol combined with an isotopic approach to assess the fate of de novo synthesized cholesterol. Our results show that trans-intestinal cholesterol excretion significantly contributes to removal of blood-derived free cholesterol in C57Bl6/J mice (33% of 231 micromol/kg/day) and that pharmacological activation of LXR with T0901317 strongly stimulates this pathway (63% of 706 micromol/kg/day). Trans-intestinal cholesterol excretion is impaired in mice lacking Abcg5 (-4%), suggesting that the cholesterol transporting Abcg5/Abcg8 heterodimer is involved in this pathway. Our data demonstrate that intestinal excretion represents a quantitatively important route for fecal removal of neutral sterols independent of biliary secretion in mice. This pathway is sensitive to pharmacological activation of the LXR system. These data support the concept that the intestine substantially contributes to reverse cholesterol transport."
https://openalex.org/W2014790939,"Background GPCRs regulate a remarkable diversity of biological functions, and are thus often targeted for drug therapies. Stimulation of a GPCR by an extracellular ligand triggers receptor signaling via G proteins, and this process is highly regulated. Receptor activation is typically accompanied by desensitization of receptor signaling, a complex feedback regulatory process of which receptor internalization is postulated as a key event. The in vivo significance of GPCR internalization is poorly understood. In fact, the majority of studies have been performed in transfected cell systems, which do not adequately model physiological environments and the complexity of integrated responses observed in the whole animal. Methods and Findings In this study, we used knock-in mice expressing functional fluorescent delta opioid receptors (DOR-eGFP) in place of the native receptor to correlate receptor localization in neurons with behavioral responses. We analyzed the pain-relieving effects of two delta receptor agonists with similar signaling potencies and efficacies, but distinct internalizing properties. An initial treatment with the high (SNC80) or low (AR-M100390) internalizing agonist equally reduced CFA-induced inflammatory pain. However, subsequent drug treatment produced highly distinct responses. Animals initially treated with SNC80 showed no analgesic response to a second dose of either delta receptor agonist. Concomitant receptor internalization and G-protein uncoupling were observed throughout the nervous system. This loss of function was temporary, since full DOR-eGFP receptor responses were restored 24 hours after SNC80 administration. In contrast, treatment with AR-M100390 resulted in retained analgesic response to a subsequent agonist injection, and ex vivo analysis showed that DOR-eGFP receptor remained G protein-coupled on the cell surface. Finally SNC80 but not AR-M100390 produced DOR-eGFP phosphorylation, suggesting that the two agonists produce distinct active receptor conformations in vivo which likely lead to differential receptor trafficking. Conclusions Together our data show that delta agonists retain full analgesic efficacy when receptors remain on the cell surface. In contrast, delta agonist-induced analgesia is abolished following receptor internalization, and complete behavioral desensitization is observed. Overall these results establish that, in the context of pain control, receptor localization fully controls receptor function in vivo. This finding has both fundamental and therapeutic implications for slow-recycling GPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2027640690,"Background Median survival is 10 months and 2-year survival is 20% in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. A small fraction of non-squamous cell lung cancers harbor EGFR mutations, with improved outcome to gefitinib and erlotinib. Experimental evidence suggests that BRCA1 overexpression enhances sensitivity to docetaxel and resistance to cisplatin. RAP80 and Abraxas are interacting proteins that form complexes with BRCA1 and could modulate the effect of BRCA1. In order to further examine the effect of EGFR mutations and BRCA1 mRNA levels on outcome in advanced NSCLC, we performed a prospective non-randomized phase II clinical trial, testing the hypothesis that customized therapy would confer improved outcome over non-customized therapy. In an exploratory analysis, we also examined the effect of RAP80 and Abraxas mRNA levels. Methodology/Principal Findings We treated 123 metastatic non-squamous cell lung carcinoma patients using a customized approach. RNA and DNA were isolated from microdissected specimens from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Patients with EGFR mutations received erlotinib, and those without EGFR mutations received chemotherapy with or without cisplatin based on their BRCA1 mRNA levels: low, cisplatin plus gemcitabine; intermediate, cisplatin plus docetaxel; high, docetaxel alone. An exploratory analysis examined RAP80 and Abraxas expression. Median survival exceeded 28 months for 12 patients with EGFR mutations, and was 11 months for 38 patients with low BRCA1, 9 months for 40 patients with intermediate BRCA1, and 11 months for 33 patients with high BRCA1. Two-year survival was 73.3%, 41.2%, 15.6% and 0%, respectively. Median survival was influenced by RAP80 expression in the three BRCA1 groups. For example, for patients with both low BRCA1 and low RAP80, median survival exceeded 26 months. RAP80 was a significant factor for survival in patients treated according to BRCA1 levels (hazard ratio, 1.3 [95% CI, 1–1.7]; P = 0.05). Conclusions/Significance Chemotherapy customized according to BRCA1 expression levels is associated with excellent median and 2-year survival for some subsets of NSCLC patients , and RAP80 could play a crucial modulating effect on this model of customized chemotherapy.

https://openalex.org/W1968659017,"One of our goals is to understand the mechanisms that deposit mineral within collagen fibrils, and as a first step we recently determined the size exclusion characteristics of the fibril. This study revealed that apatite crystals up to 12 unit cells in size can access the water within the fibril, whereas molecules larger than a 40-kDa protein are excluded. Based on these observations, we proposed a novel mechanism for fibril mineralization: that macromolecular inhibitors of apatite growth favor fibril mineralization by selectively inhibiting crystal growth in the solution outside of the fibril. To test this mechanism, we developed a system in which crystal formation is driven by homogeneous nucleation at high calcium phosphate concentration and the only macromolecule in solution is fetuin, a 48-kDa inhibitor of apatite growth. Our experiments with this system demonstrated that fetuin determines the location of mineral growth; in the presence of fetuin mineral grows exclusively within the fibril, whereas in its absence mineral grows in solution outside the fibril. Additional experiments showed that fetuin is also able to localize calcification to the interior of synthetic matrices that have size exclusion characteristics similar to those of collagen and that it does so by selectively inhibiting mineral growth outside of these matrices. We termed this new calcification mechanism “mineralization by inhibitor exclusion,” the selective mineralization of a matrix using a macromolecular inhibitor of mineral growth that is excluded from that matrix. Future studies will be needed to evaluate the possible role of this mechanism in bone mineralization.

We termed this new calcification mechanism “mineralization by inhibitor exclusion,” the selective mineralization of a matrix using a macromolecular inhibitor of mineral growth that is excluded from that matrix. Future studies will be needed to evaluate the possible role of this mechanism in bone mineralization. The type I collagen fibril plays several critical roles in bone mineralization. The mineral in bone is located primarily within the fibril (1Tong W. Glimcher M.J. Katz J.L. Kuhn L. Eppell S.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2003; 72: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Katz E.P. Li S.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 1973: 1-15Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 3Sasaki N. Sudoh Y. Calcif.

Bone. 2003; 33: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and during mineralization the fibril is formed first and then water within the fibril is replaced with mineral (7Robinson R.A. Elliott S.R. J. Bone Joint Surg. 1957; 39A: 167-188Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8Boivin G. Meunier P.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2002; 70: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The collagen fibril therefore provides the aqueous compartment in which mineral grows. We have recently shown that the physical structure of the collagen fibril plays an important additional role in mineralization, that of a gatekeeper allowing molecules smaller than a 6-kDa protein to freely access the water within the fibril while preventing molecules larger than a 40-kDa protein from entering the fibril (9Toroian D. Lim J.E. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22437-22447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Molecules too large to enter the collagen fibril can have important effects on mineralization within the fibril. We have suggested that large inhibitors of apatite growth can paradoxically favor mineralization within the fibril by selectively preventing apatite growth in the solution outside of the fibril (9Toroian D. Lim J.E. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22437-22447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We have also proposed that large nucleators of apatite formation may generate small crystals outside the collagen fibril and that some of these crystals can subsequently diffuse into the fibril and grow (9Toroian D. Lim J.E. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22437-22447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Because the size exclusion characteristics of the fibril allow rapid penetration of molecules the size of a 6-kDa protein, apatite crystals up to 12 unit cells in size should in principle be able to freely access all of the water within the fibril (9Toroian D. Lim J.E. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22437-22447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We subsequently tested these hypotheses for the role of large molecules in fibril mineralization by determining the impact of removing fetuin on the serum-driven calcification of collagen fibrils (10Toroian D. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2008; 82: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fetuin is the most abundant serum inhibitor of apatite crystal growth (11Jahnen-Dechent W. Schinke T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and with a molecular weight of 48 kDa fetuin is too large to penetrate the collagen fibril (9Toroian D. Lim J.E. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22437-22447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Fetuin is also termed fetuin-A (to distinguish it from a recently discovered homologue, fetuin-B (13Olivier E. Soury E. Ruminy P. Husson A. Parmentier F. Daveau M. Salier J.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)) and is sometimes called α2-HS glycoprotein in humans. Our working hypothesis was that fetuin is required for the serum-driven calcification of a collagen fibril and that its role is to favor calcification within the collagen fibril by selectively preventing apatite crystal growth in the solution outside the fibril. The results of this study demonstrate that removing fetuin from serum eliminates the ability of serum to induce the calcification of a type I collagen matrix and that adding purified fetuin to fetuin-depleted serum restores this activity (14Toroian D. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2008; 82: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This study further shows that a massive mineral precipitate forms during the incubation of fetuin-depleted serum but not during the incubation of serum containing fetuin (14Toroian D. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2008; 82: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that a large serum nucleator generates apatite crystals in the solution outside of the collagen fibril, some of which penetrate into the aqueous interior of the fibril (14Toroian D. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2008; 82: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because fetuin can trap only those nuclei that it can access, the crystal nuclei that penetrate the fibril grow far more rapidly than those nuclei trapped by fetuin outside of the fibril, and the collagen fibril therefore selectively calcifies. The goal of the present experiments was to further understand the role of fetuin in the calcification of type I collagen fibrils. To accomplish this goal, we developed a system in which crystal formation is driven by homogeneous nucleation at high calcium phosphate concentrations and the only macromolecule in the solution is fetuin. This system allowed us to probe the impact of fetuin and only fetuin on the location and extent of collagen calcification. Because fetuin is the subject of this study, it is useful to review briefly its occurrence and calcification-inhibitory activity. Fetuin is a 48-kDa glycoprotein that is synthesized in the liver and is found at high concentrations in mammalian serum (15Pedersen K.O.

The serum fetuin concentration in adult mammals ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, whereas the serum fetuin concentration in the fetus and neonate is typically far higher (16Brown W.M. Saunders N.R. M⊘llgård K. Dziegielewska K.M. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).

Despite the abundance of fetuin in bone, however, it has not been possible to demonstrate the synthesis of fetuin in calcified tissues, and it is therefore presently thought that the fetuin found in bone arises from hepatic synthesis via serum (20Mizuno M. Farach-Carson M.C. Pinero G.J. Fujisawa R. Brunn J.C. Seyer J.M. Bousfield G.R. Mark M.P. Butler W.T. Bone Miner. 1991; 13: 1-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Wendel M. Heinegård D. Franzén A. Matrix. 1993; 13: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This view is supported by the observation that fetuin binds strongly to apatite, the mineral phase of bone, and is selectively concentrated from serum onto apatite (18Ashton B.A. Hohling H.J. Triffitt J.T. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1976; 22: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that fetuin is an important inhibitor of apatite growth and precipitation in serum containing increased levels of calcium and phosphate (12Schinke T. Amendt C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and that targeted deletion of the fetuin gene reduces the ability of serum to arrest apatite formation by over 70% (11Jahnen-Dechent W.

More recent studies have shown that a fetuin-mineral complex is formed in the course of the fetuin-mediated inhibition of apatite growth and precipitation in serum containing increased calcium and phosphate (24Price P.A.

J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14815-14825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Purified fetuin also potently inhibits the growth of apatite crystals from supersaturated solutions of calcium phosphate (12Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Pöschke O. Müller-Esterl W.

In solutions in which a decline in calcium occurs within minutes because of the spontaneous formation of apatite crystals, the presence of added fetuin sustains elevated calcium levels for at least 24 h (24Price P.A.

Alizarin red S, bovine fetuin, acrylamide, and bisacrylamide were purchased from Sigma, and Sephadex G25 and G75 were obtained from GE Healthcare. Tibias were dissected from 22-day-old rats and cut to obtain a 1-cm section of the tibia midshaft as described (26Price P.A. June H.H. Hamlin N.J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol.

Bovine bone sand was prepared from the midshaft region of bovine tibias using procedures that have been described previously (30Hamlin N.J. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2004; 75: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); the median diameter of the bone sand was 0.5 mm. Rat tibias and bovine bone sand were demineralized for 72 h at room temperature in 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5, using a 300-fold molar excess of EDTA to mineral calcium, washed exhaustively with ultra-pure water, dried, and stored at −20 °C until use. Tendons were obtained from the tails of 40-day-old rats as described (26Price P.A. June H.H. Hamlin N.J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol.

Four-mg samples of dry tendon or demineralized bone were rehydrated by overnight equilibration in ultra-pure water before use. Chondroitin sulfate A (bovine trachea), purchased from Calbiochem, was dialyzed extensively against 50 mm NH4HCO3 using a 100-kDa molecular weight cut-off dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por Biotech) and freeze-dried. Poly-l-glutamic acid (50–100 kDa) was obtained from Sigma. The University of California, San Diego Animal Subjects Committee approved all animal experiments. The procedures used for Alizarin red staining have been described (27Hamlin N.J. Ong K.G. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2006; 78: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For histological analyses, tibias were fixed in 100% ethanol for at least 1 day at room temperature; San Diego Pathology Inc. (San Diego, CA) sectioned and von Kossa-stained the tibias. For quantitative assessment of the extent of calcification, Alizarin red-stained matrices and precipitates formed outside the matrix were extracted for 24 h at room temperature with 1 ml of 0.15 m HCl as described (28Price P.A. Roublick A.M. Williamson M.K. Kidney int. 2006; 70: 1577-1583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Calcium levels in calcification solutions and in the acid extracts of tissues and precipitates were determined colorimetrically using cresolphthalein complexone (JAS Diagnostics, Miami, FL), and phosphate levels were determined colorimetrically as described (29Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5834) Google Scholar). To compare the ability of fetuin to penetrate synthetic matrices, each matrix was equilibrated overnight with a 5 mg/ml solution of fetuin and then stained for protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Sephadex G75 beads and 4% acrylamide gels stained intensely blue, showing that fetuin penetrated both matrices. In contrast, Sephadex G25 beads and 40% acrylamide gels did not stain. The typical solution used for investigating matrix calcification was prepared at room temperature using a procedure designed to achieve the near instantaneous mixing of calcium and phosphate and to thereby ensure that subsequent mineral formation occurred by homogenous nucleation in the resulting unstable solution (24Price P.A.

One ml of 0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm CaCl2 was placed into one 10 × 75-mm test tube, and another 1 ml of 0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm sodium phosphate (also pH 7.4) was placed into a second tube. A disposable pipette was used to withdraw the phosphate solution and to then expel this solution with force into the calcium solution. All HEPES buffer solutions contained 0.02% sodium azide to prevent bacterial growth; the HEPES buffer for all fetuin-containing calcification solutions also contained 5 mg of bovine fetuin/ml of buffer. Unless otherwise stated, the matrices tested using this procedure were added immediately after mixing to achieve the final 5 mm calcium and phosphate conditions; these included a 1-cm segment of hydrated, demineralized, tibia midshaft from a weanling rat (dry weight about 4 mg); hydrated, demineralized, bovine bone sand (4 mg dry weight); hydrated rat tail tendons (4 mg dry weight); hydrated Sephadex G25 or G75 (4 mg dry weight); and single 1 × 5 × 5-mm segments of 4 or 40% polyacrylamide slab gels (40% is 39.33 g of acrylamide and 0.67 g of bisacrylamide/100 ml). To monitor the decrease in calcium due to the formation of mineral, aliquots of the calcification solution were removed at the desired times and centrifuged for 10 s to sediment mineral. The supernatant was then diluted 1:4 with 0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.4, and analyzed for calcium. To determine the capacity of bone for mineral, 4 mg of demineralized bovine bone sand (dry weight) was added to a 50-ml volume of fetuin calcification solution (5 mm calcium and phosphate, 0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 45 mm NaHCO3, 5 mg/ml fetuin, and 0.02% azide) and mixed end-over-end at room temperature for 2 days. For subsequent recalcification cycles, the spent solution was replaced with fresh calcification solution, and the bone sand was mixed for another 2 days. To determine the importance of demineralization to the capacity of bone for mineral, this experiment was repeated using 18 mg of non-demineralized bone sand, an amount that yielded 4 mg of demineralized bone matrix. For preparation of recalcified bone matrix for spectroscopic analysis, 4 mg of demineralized bovine bone sand (dry weight) was again added to each of three 50-ml volumes of fetuin calcification solution and mixed end-over-end at room temperature for 2 days. The recalcified bone sand was dried and ground in an agate mortar; an equivalent amount of non-demineralized bovine bone sand served as a control. The resulting powders were first analyzed using a Scintag SDF 2000 x-ray diffractometer, and a portion of this powder was then analyzed at 4 cm−1 resolution for 256 scans using a Nicolet Magna IR 550 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 2The abbreviations used are: FTIRFourier transform infraredBGPbone Gla proteinMPGmatrix Gla protein. spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared bone Gla protein matrix Gla protein. To prepare calcified tendon collagen for scanning electron microscopy, 4 mg of rat tail tendon (dry weight) was added to a 50-ml volume of fetuin calcification solution and mixed end-over-end at room temperature for 2 days. Samples of calcified and noncalcified tendon collagen were washed with 0.05% KOH, dehydrated in ethanol, and dried. The samples were then sputter-coated with an ultra-thin layer of gold/palladium and examined at 20 kV with an FEI Quanta 600 scanning electron microscope with an Oxford energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer. We first determined whether fetuin is able to selectively favor the recalcification of the type I collagen fibrils in demineralized bone when crystal nuclei are generated by homogeneous nucleation at high calcium phosphate ion product. The high ion product solution was generated by rapidly mixing equal 1-ml volumes of 10 mm phosphate and 10 mm calcium to obtain a homogenous solution containing each ionic component at 5 mm in a pH 7.4 buffer. Previous studies have shown that a calcium phosphate mineral forms throughout this solution within minutes of mixing, whereas if fetuin is added prior to mixing there is no visible evidence of mineral formation (12Schinke T.

In this 2-ml volume, there was only sufficient calcium and phosphate to restore ∼5% of the mineral that was present in the tibia prior to demineralization. The rate of mineral formation was monitored by the decline in calcium remaining in solution. As seen in Fig. 1, there was no decrease in calcium in solutions containing fetuin but no tibia. This result is consistent with earlier studies (26Price P.A. June H.H. Hamlin N.J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19169-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and illustrates the ability of fetuin to potently inhibit mineral growth and precipitation. As also seen in Fig. 1, if both fetuin and a demineralized tibia are present, there is a decrease in solution calcium that begins about 5 h after the addition of the tibia, and solution calcium is reduced by about 4-fold at 8 h. Chemical analysis showed that the amount of calcium and phosphate incorporated into the tibia at 24 h accounted for the decrease in solution calcium and phosphate, and there was no evidence for a calcium phosphate precipitate in the solution outside of the tibia (Fig. 2). The recalcified tibias stained uniformly for calcification with Alizarin red, and von Kossa staining of tibia sections showed that calcification foci was found throughout the bone matrix (not shown).FIGURE 2The recalcification of bone by using fetuin to selectively inhibit mineral growth outside the collagen fibril: analysis for mineral calcium and phosphate. The experiment described in the legend for Fig. 1 was terminated at 24 h, and the mineral that precipitated outside of the tibia was separated from the tibia. Then the mineral precipitate and tibia were both analyzed for calcium and phosphate. The results show the mean ± S.D. of the measurements made on the three replicate bone samples at each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These experiments were repeated using solutions of the same composition but lacking fetuin in order to confirm the role of fetuin in the recalcification of demineralized tibias. In agreement with earlier studies (24Price P.A. Lim J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22144-22152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), in the absence of fetuin a finely dispersed mineral precipitate formed within minutes of mixing to create 5 mm calcium and phosphate, and solution calcium levels fell 5-fold within 2 h of mixing (Fig. 1). The presence of a demineralized tibia had no significant impact on the rate of calcium loss from solution in this experiment (Fig. 1). After a 24-h incubation of a demineralized tibia in the solution lacking fetuin, chemical analysis showed that most of the mineral present was in a precipitate in the solution outside of the tibia, not within the tibia (Fig. 2), and that the tibia did not stain with Alizarin red or von Kossa (not shown). These observations clearly show that the presence of fetuin in an unstable, supersaturated solution containing 5 mm calcium and phosphate determines the location of the calcium phosphate mineral growth. In the absence of fetuin, mineral growth occurs primarily in the solution outside of bone collagen, whereas in the presence of fetuin, mineral growth occurs almost exclusively within bone collagen. We next investigated the capacity of bone collagen to take up mineral using the fetuin recalcification procedure. Ground bone, rather than a tibia, was used for this test to increase the ratio of matrix surface to volume and thereby enhance the diffusion of calcium, phosphate, or small crystals into collagen. The volume of the fetuin-containing recalcification solution was increased to 50 ml so that the calcium in the recalcification solution (250 μmol) would exceed the calcium originally found in the bone matrix (114 μmol). Finally, some of the samples were subjected to as many as three consecutive recalcification cycles, each in fresh 50-ml volumes of recalcification solution. The first experiment examined the capacity of demineralized bone to take up mineral during three successive recalcification cycles. As seen in Fig. 3, the greatest increase in mineral occurred in the first recalcification cycle, and it declined markedly by the third. At this point, the amount of calcium and phosphate introduced into demineralized bone was about 70% of that found in the adult bovine bone prior to demineralization. The second experiment showed that a single recalcification cycle does not significantly increase the mineral content of non-demineralized bone (Fig. 3). This observation shows that the incorporation of mineral into bone using this procedure requires prior demineralization. We used several methods to assess the nature of the calcium phosphate mineral incorporated into demineralized bone by this procedure. The results of these measurements revealed that the mineral in recalcified bone is similar to the mineral found in bone prior to demineralization. 1) The molar calcium to phosphate ratios calculated from the data presented in Fig. 3 range from 1.68 ± 0.03 for the first recalcification cycle to 1.66 ± 0.03 for the second and third cycles. These ratios are not significantly different from the ratios calculated from the Fig. 3 data for non-demineralized bone (1.66 ± 0.02 and 1.64 ± 0.03). 2) The powder x-ray diffraction spectrum obtained for demineralized bone after one recalcification cycle is comparable with the spectrum obtained for bone prior to demineralization (Fig. 4), and the diffraction peaks seen in both spectra are in the positions expected for synthetic hydroxyapatite crystals (30Hamlin N.J. Price P.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2004; 75: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 3) The FTIR absorbance spectra obtained for demineralized bone after one recalcification cycle is comparable with the spectrum obtained for bone prior to demineralization (Fig. 4). In the recalcified bone, the peak heights obtained for mineral components (phosphate and carbonate) are reduced relative to those for protein components (amide I and II); this observation is consistent with the fact that, after a single recalcification cycle, the partially remineralized bone has only about 40% of the mineral content of non-demineralized bone (Fig. 3). In the above experiments we have consistently used a 5 mg/ml fetu"

Prior experimental data suggest a wide variety of lipid species can bind to CD1 molecules, but little is known about the characteristics of cellular ligands that are selected for presentation. Here we have molecularly characterized lipids bound to the human CD1d isoform. Ligands were eluted from secreted CD1d molecules and separated by normal phase HPLC, then characterized by mass spectroscopy. A total of 177 lipid species were molecularly identified, comprising glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. The glycerophospholipids included common diacylglycerol species, reduced forms known as plasmalogens, lyso-phospholipids (monoacyl species), and cardiolipins (tetraacyl species). The sphingolipids included sphingomyelins and glycosylated forms, such as the ganglioside GM3. These results demonstrate that human CD1d molecules bind a surprising diversity of lipid structures within the secretory pathway, including compounds that have been reported to play roles in cancer, autoimmune diseases, lipid signaling, and cell death."

CSF BDNF level was lower in AD patients compared to age-matched Normals (p = 0.02). CSF BDNF concentration decreased with age among Normals and was higher in women than men (both p<0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, education, CSF Abeta(42) and total tau, and APOE and BDNF genotypes, lower CSF BDNF concentration was associated poorer immediate and delayed recall at baseline (both p<0.05) and in follow up of approximately 3 years duration (both p<0.01).Reduced CSF BDNF was associated with age-related cognitive decline, suggesting a potential mechanism that may contribute in part to cognitive decline in older individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2015821148,"Background With the availability of new preventive and curative interventions, global malaria control has been strengthened significantly in recent years. Drugs effective in reducing malaria gametocytaemia might contribute to local elimination and possible long-term eradication. We here report on the effects of methylene blue (MB)-based malaria combination therapy on gametocytaemia during a randomised-controlled trial in Burkina Faso. Methods An open-label randomised controlled phase II study in 180 children aged 6–10 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria was conducted in Nouna, north-western Burkina Faso. Children were randomised to MB–artesunate (AS), MB–amodiaquine (AQ), and AS-AQ (local standard of care). Overall follow-up was for 28 days, follow-up for gametocytaemia was for 14 days. Findings The treatment groups were similar in baseline characteristics and there was only one loss to follow-up. Compared to AS-AQ, both MB-containing regimens were associated with significantly reduced gametocyte carrier rates during follow-up days 3, 7, and 14. This effect was seen both in patients with and without P. falciparum gametocytaemia at baseline. Interpretation MB reveals pronounced gametocytocidal activity which appears to act against both existing and developing P. falciparum gametocytes. MB-based combination therapy thus has the potential to reduce transmission of P. falciparum malaria in endemic regions, which has important implications for future elimination and eradication strategies.

Cadherin-like proteins have been reported as functional Cry1A toxin receptors in Lepidoptera. Here we present data that demonstrate that a coleopteran cadherin is a functional Cry3Aa toxin receptor. The Cry3Aa receptor cadherin was cloned from Tenebrio molitor larval midgut mRNA, and the predicted protein, TmCad1, has domain structure and a putative toxin binding region similar to those in lepidopteran cadherin B. thuringiensis receptors. A peptide containing the putative toxin binding region from TmCad1 bound specifically to Cry3Aa and promoted the formation of Cry3Aa toxin oligomers, proposed to be mediators of toxicity in lepidopterans. Injection of TmCad1-specific double-stranded RNA into T. molitor larvae resulted in knockdown of the TmCad1 transcript and conferred resistance to Cry3Aa toxicity. These data demonstrate the functional role of TmCad1 as a Cry3Aa receptor in T. molitor and reveal similarities between the mode of action of Cry toxins in Lepidoptera and Coleoptera."
https://openalex.org/W2078755430,"Background Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is the bidirectional movement of IFT particles between the cell body and the distal tip of a flagellum. Organized into complexes A and B, IFT particles are composed of at least 18 proteins. The function of IFT proteins in flagellar assembly has been extensively investigated. However, much less is known about the molecular mechanism of how IFT is regulated. Methodology/Principal Findings We herein report the identification of a novel IFT particle protein, IFT25, in Chlamydomonas. Dephosphorylation assay revealed that IFT25 is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical analysis of temperature sensitive IFT mutants indicated that IFT25 is an IFT complex B subunit. In vitro binding assay confirmed that IFT25 binds to IFT27, a Rab-like small GTPase component of the IFT complex B. Immunofluorescence staining showed that IFT25 has a punctuate flagellar distribution as expected for an IFT protein, but displays a unique distribution pattern at the flagellar base. IFT25 co-localizes with IFT27 at the distal-most portion of basal bodies, probably the transition zones, and concentrates in the basal body region by partially overlapping with other IFT complex B subunits, such as IFT46. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis demonstrated that, in flagella, the majority of IFT27 and IFT25 including both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms are cosedimented with other complex B subunits in the 16S fractions. In contrast, in cell body, only a fraction of IFT25 and IFT27 is integrated into the preassembled complex B, and IFT25 detected in complex B is preferentially phosphorylated. Conclusion/Significance IFT25 is a phosphoprotein component of IFT particle complex B. IFT25 directly interacts with IFT27, and these two proteins likely form a subcomplex in vivo. We postulate that the association and disassociation between the subcomplex of IFT25 and IFT27 and complex B might be involved in the regulation of IFT."
https://openalex.org/W2053254077,"Calculating the metabolome size of species by genome-guided reconstruction of metabolic pathways misses all products from orphan genes and from enzymes lacking annotated genes. Hence, metabolomes need to be determined experimentally. Annotations by mass spectrometry would greatly benefit if peer-reviewed public databases could be queried to compile target lists of structures that already have been reported for a given species. We detail current obstacles to compile such a knowledge base of metabolites.As an example, results are presented for rice. Two rice (oryza sativa) subspecies have been fully sequenced, oryza japonica and oryza indica. Several major small molecule databases were compared for listing known rice metabolites comprising PubChem, Chemical Abstracts, Beilstein, Patent databases, Dictionary of Natural Products, SetupX/BinBase, KNApSAcK DB, and finally those databases which were obtained by computational approaches, i.e. RiceCyc, KEGG, and Reactome. More than 5,000 small molecules were retrieved when searching these databases. Unfortunately, most often, genuine rice metabolites were retrieved together with non-metabolite database entries such as pesticides. Overlaps from database compound lists were very difficult to compare because structures were either not encoded in machine-readable format or because compound identifiers were not cross-referenced between databases.We conclude that present databases are not capable of comprehensively retrieving all known metabolites. Metabolome lists are yet mostly restricted to genome-reconstructed pathways. We suggest that providers of (bio)chemical databases enrich their database identifiers to PubChem IDs and InChIKeys to enable cross-database queries. In addition, peer-reviewed journal repositories need to mandate submission of structures and spectra in machine readable format to allow automated semantic annotation of articles containing chemical structures. Such changes in publication standards and database architectures will enable researchers to compile current knowledge about the metabolome of species, which may extend to derived information such as spectral libraries, organ-specific metabolites, and cross-study comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W2064167215,"Fractures are among the most common human traumas. Fracture healing represents a unique temporarily definable post-natal process in which to study the complex interactions of multiple molecular events that regulate endochondral skeletal tissue formation. Because of the regenerative nature of fracture healing, it is hypothesized that large numbers of post-natal stem cells are recruited and contribute to formation of the multiple cell lineages that contribute to this process. Bayesian modeling was used to generate the temporal profiles of the transcriptome during fracture healing. The temporal relationships between ontologies that are associated with various biologic, metabolic, and regulatory pathways were identified and related to developmental processes associated with skeletogenesis, vasculogenesis, and neurogenesis. The complement of all the expressed BMPs, Wnts, FGFs, and their receptors were related to the subsets of transcription factors that were concurrently expressed during fracture healing. We further defined during fracture healing the temporal patterns of expression for 174 of the 193 genes known to be associated with human genetic skeletal disorders. In order to identify the common regulatory features that might be present in stem cells that are recruited during fracture healing to other types of stem cells, we queried the transcriptome of fracture healing against that seen in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Approximately 300 known genes that are preferentially expressed in ESCs and ∼350 of the known genes that are preferentially expressed in MSCs showed induction during fracture healing. Nanog, one of the central epigenetic regulators associated with ESC stem cell maintenance, was shown to be associated in multiple forms or bone repair as well as MSC differentiation. In summary, these data present the first temporal analysis of the transcriptome of an endochondral bone formation process that takes place during fracture healing. They show that neurogenesis as well as vasculogenesis are predominant components of skeletal tissue formation and suggest common pathways are shared between post-natal stem cells and those seen in ESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2092215851,"Calcium and apatite granulations are demonstrated here to form in both human and fetal bovine serum in response to the simple addition of either calcium or phosphate, or a combination of both. These granulations are shown to represent precipitating complexes of protein and hydroxyapatite (HAP) that display marked pleomorphism, appearing as round, laminated particles, spindles, and films. These same complexes can be found in normal untreated serum, albeit at much lower amounts, and appear to result from the progressive binding of serum proteins with apatite until reaching saturation, upon which the mineralo-protein complexes precipitate. Chemically and morphologically, these complexes are virtually identical to the so-called nanobacteria (NB) implicated in numerous diseases and considered unusual for their small size, pleomorphism, and the presence of HAP. Like NB, serum granulations can seed particles upon transfer to serum-free medium, and their main protein constituents include albumin, complement components 3 and 4A, fetuin-A, and apolipoproteins A1 and B100, as well as other calcium and apatite binding proteins found in the serum. However, these serum mineralo-protein complexes are formed from the direct chemical binding of inorganic and organic phases, bypassing the need for any biological processes, including the long cultivation in cell culture conditions deemed necessary for the demonstration of NB. Thus, these serum granulations may result from physiologically inherent processes that become amplified with calcium phosphate loading or when subjected to culturing in medium. They may be viewed as simple mineralo-protein complexes formed from the deployment of calcification-inhibitory pathways used by the body to cope with excess calcium phosphate so as to prevent unwarranted calcification. Rather than representing novel pathophysiological mechanisms or exotic lifeforms, these results indicate that the entities described earlier as NB most likely originate from calcium and apatite binding factors in the serum, presumably calcification inhibitors, that upon saturation, form seeds for HAP deposition and growth. These calcium granulations are similar to those found in organisms throughout nature and may represent the products of more general calcium regulation pathways involved in the control of calcium storage, retrieval, tissue deposition, and disposal."
https://openalex.org/W2012346470,"Background The process of translation occurs at a nexus point downstream of a number of signal pathways and developmental processes. Modeling activation of the PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway in the Eμ-Myc mouse is a valuable tool to study tumor genotype/chemosensitivity relationships in vivo. In this model, blocking translation initiation with silvestrol, an inhibitor of the ribosome recruitment step has been showed to modulate the sensitivity of the tumors to the effect of standard chemotherapy. However, inhibitors of translation elongation have been tested as potential anti-cancer therapeutic agents in vitro, but have not been extensively tested in genetically well-defined mouse tumor models or for potential synergy with standard of care agents. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we chose four structurally different chemical inhibitors of translation elongation: homoharringtonine, bruceantin, didemnin B and cycloheximide, and tested their ability to alter the chemoresistance of Eμ-myc lymphomas harbouring lesions in Pten, Tsc2, Bcl-2, or eIF4E. We show that in some genetic settings, translation elongation inhibitors are able to synergize with doxorubicin by reinstating an apoptotic program in tumor cells. We attribute this effect to a reduction in levels of pro-oncogenic or pro-survival proteins having short half-lives, like Mcl-1, cyclin D1 or c-Myc. Using lymphomas cells grown ex vivo we reproduced the synergy observed in mice between chemotherapy and elongation inhibition and show that this is reversed by blocking protein degradation with a proteasome inhibitor. Conclusion/Significance Our results indicate that depleting short-lived pro-survival factors by inhibiting their synthesis could achieve a therapeutic response in tumors harboring PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway mutations."

There is evidence for oxidative stress in pre eclampsia. Recently it was shown that placental oxygen concentration is related to sFlt-1 and inhibin A. In addition it is reported that oxidative stress markers are increased in placental tissue delivered after labour. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate if these proteins are altered in maternal circulation of labouring pre-eclampsia and normal pregnancies.To assess the effects of labour, samples were taken from 10 normal pregnant (NP) and 10 pre-eclamptic (PE) women pre-labour, full dilation, placental delivery and 24 h. To assess the effects of placental delivery, plasma samples were taken from 10NP and 10PE women undergoing elective Caesarean section, pre-delivery, placental delivery and 10 min, 60 min and 24 h post delivery. SFlt-1 and sEng and activin A and inhibin A were measured using commercial and in house ELISA's respectively.The levels of sFlt-1 and sEng were significantly higher in PE compared to NP women in both groups. In labour, sFlt-1 levels increased significantly at full dilatation in PE women, before declining by 24 hr. However there was no significant rise in sEng levels in labour. Activin A and inhibin A levels declined rapidly with placental delivery in NP and PE pregnancies. There was a significant rise in activin A levels during labour in PE compared to pre labour, but inhibin levels did not increase.Labour in pre-eclamptic women increases the levels of sFlt-1 and activin A. This pilot data suggests that increase in the maternal levels of these factors in labour could predict and/or contribute to the maternal syndrome postpartum."
https://openalex.org/W2062088534,"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a disorder caused by mutations in cohesion proteins, is characterized by multisystem developmental abnormalities. PDS5, a cohesion protein, is important for proper chromosome segregation in lower organisms and has two homologues in vertebrates (PDS5A and PDS5B). Pds5B mutant mice have developmental abnormalities resembling CdLS; however the role of Pds5A in mammals and the association of PDS5 proteins with CdLS are unknown. To delineate genetic interactions between Pds5A and Pds5B and explore mechanisms underlying phenotypic variability, we generated Pds5A-deficient mice. Curiously, these mice exhibit multiple abnormalities that were previously observed in Pds5B-deficient mice, including cleft palate, skeletal patterning defects, growth retardation, congenital heart defects and delayed migration of enteric neuron precursors. They also frequently display renal agenesis, an abnormality not observed in Pds5B(-/-) mice. While Pds5A(-/-) and Pds5B(-/-) mice die at birth, embryos harboring 3 mutant Pds5 alleles die between E11.5 and E12.5 most likely of heart failure, indicating that total Pds5 gene dosage is critical for normal development. In addition, characterization of these compound homozygous-heterozygous mice revealed a severe abnormality in lens formation that does not occur in either Pds5A(-/-) or Pds5B(-/-) mice. We further identified a functional missense mutation (R1292Q) in the PDS5B DNA-binding domain in a familial case of CdLS, in which affected individuals also develop megacolon. This study shows that PDS5A and PDS5B functions other than those involving chromosomal dynamics are important for normal development, highlights the sensitivity of key developmental processes on PDS5 signaling, and provides mechanistic insights into how PDS5 mutations may lead to CdLS."
https://openalex.org/W2149470396,"The human motor system is highly redundant, having more kinematic degrees of freedom than necessary to complete a given task. Understanding how kinematic redundancies are utilized in different tasks remains a fundamental question in motor control. One possibility is that they can be used to tune the mechanical properties of a limb to the specific requirements of a task. For example, many tasks such as tool usage compromise arm stability along specific directions. These tasks only can be completed if the nervous system adapts the mechanical properties of the arm such that the arm, coupled to the tool, remains stable. The purpose of this study was to determine if posture selection is a critical component of endpoint stiffness regulation during unconstrained tasks.Three-dimensional (3D) estimates of endpoint stiffness were used to quantify limb mechanics. Most previous studies examining endpoint stiffness adaptation were completed in 2D using constrained postures to maintain a non-redundant mapping between joint angles and hand location. Our hypothesis was that during unconstrained conditions, subjects would select arm postures that matched endpoint stiffness to the functional requirements of the task. The hypothesis was tested during endpoint tracking tasks in which subjects interacted with unstable haptic environments, simulated using a 3D robotic manipulator. We found that arm posture had a significant effect on endpoint tracking accuracy and that subjects selected postures that improved tracking performance. For environments in which arm posture had a large effect on tracking accuracy, the self-selected postures oriented the direction of maximal endpoint stiffness towards the direction of the unstable haptic environment.These results demonstrate how changes in arm posture can have a dramatic effect on task performance and suggest that postural selection is a fundamental mechanism by which kinematic redundancies can be exploited to regulate arm stiffness in unconstrained tasks."

Trophoblast invasion, fetoplacental vascular development, and maternal vascular remodeling are key events for the formation of the hemochorial placenta in humans. Human placental trophoblasts make direct contact with maternal blood to mediate efficient gas and nutrient exchange between mother and fetus. It is evident that failure in the aforementioned key events will compromise placental function and have a significant impact on the health of both fetus and mother. Preeclampsia is a major pregnancy-specific disorder affecting 5–7% of pregnancies worldwide. The clinical features of preeclampsia include hypertension, proteinuria, and edema. Although the etiologic factors of preeclampsia are currently unknown, shallow trophoblast invasion and poor maternal vascular remodeling have been reported in preeclamptic placentas.

GCM1 (also known as GCMa) is a key transcription factor in placental development.

Since hypoxia caused by incomplete trophoblast invasion and impaired spiral arterial remodeling is associated with preeclampsia (16Redman C.W. Sargent I.L. Science. 2005; 308: 1592-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar, 17Brosens I.A. Robertson W.B. Dixon H.G. Obstet. Gynecol. Annu. 1972; 1: 177-191PubMed Google Scholar), we speculated that decreased GCM1 activity contributes to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. To better understand the role of GCM1 in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, we have investigated the molecular mechanism by which hypoxia decreases GCM1 expression. We show here that the PI3K-Akt pathway is inactivated under hypoxia, which results in activation of GSK-3β in placental cells. Activated GSK-3β phosphorylates the Ser322 residue in GCM1 and promotes GCM1 ubiquitination and degradation via the SCFFBW2 E3 ligase. Importantly, hypoxia-induced GCM1 degradation was blocked by pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3β by LiCl. Moreover, we demonstrate that GCM1 positively autoregulates its own promoter activity, forming a positive feedback cascade that activates gene expression critical for placental development. Therefore, GCM1 degradation induced by hypoxia would result in profound decrease in expression of GCM1 target genes, contributing to preeclampsia. Our results delineate the signaling pathway responsible for hypoxia-induced GCM1 degradation, which could play a critical role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and offer potential novel therapeutic opportunity. The expression plasmids, pHA-GCM1, pGCM1-FLAG, pFBW2-Myc, and pHA-Ub, have been described previously (18Yang C.S. Yu C. Chuang H.C. Chang C.W. Chang G.D. Yao T.P. Chen H. J. Biol.

The expression plasmids for mutant HA-GCM1 and GCM1-FLAG with site-specific mutation were constructed by two-step PCR. The expression plasmids for Myc-tagged GSK-3β-wild type (WT), GSK-3β-constitutively active (CA), and GSK-3β-kinase-dead (KD) were kindly provided by Dr. Mien-Chie Hung (University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center). The expression plasmids, pMyc-p110*, pHA-myr-Akt, and pAkt-KA, have been described previously (19Huang W.C. Chen C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6592-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid, p(GBS)4E1BLuc, has been described previously (20Chang C.W. Chuang H.C. Yu C. Yao T.P. Chen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8401-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 293T, BeWo, and JAR cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Stable BeWo cells expressing HA-tagged GCM1 (BeWo31) were established as previously described (18Yang C.S. Yu C. Chuang H.C. Chang C.W. Chang G.D. Yao T.P. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10083-10090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 293T cells were maintained at 37 °C in minimal essential medium α medium, with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. JAR, BeWo, and BeWo31 were maintained at 37 °C in F-12K medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and the aforementioned antibiotics. Isolation and purification of villous cytotrophoblast (CTB) cells from term placentas was performed according to Kliman et al. (21Kliman H.J. Nestler J.E. Sermasi E. Sanger J.M. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1567-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). Purified CTB cells were maintained at 37 °C in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and the aforementioned antibiotics. For transient expression, 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmid(s) using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. Transfection of siRNA into 293T cells was performed with the TransIT TKO reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). Hypoxia was achieved by exposing cells to 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 in a multigas incubator (Astec, Fukuoka, Japan) or to 250 μm CoCl2, an agent with effects that mimic hypoxic conditions, whereas normoxia was achieved with 21% O2, 5% CO2, and balanced N2. For in vivo ubiquitination assays of GCM1, 293T cells were transfected with pGCM1-FLAG, pHA-Ub, and the indicated GSK-3β expression plasmid or siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), followed by treatment with MG132. Analysis of the ubiquitinated GCM1 was performed by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (mAb; Sigma) and by immunoblotting using anti-HA mAb (Sigma) as previously described (18Yang C.S. Yu C. Chuang H.C. Chang C.W. Chang G.D. Yao T.P. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10083-10090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Akt, Ser(P)308-Akt, Ser(P)473-Akt, GSK-3β, and Ser(P)9-GSK-3β were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Antibody against Tyr(P)216-GSK-3β was obtained from Invitrogen. Phospho-specific antibodies to Ser322 and Ser326 were individually raised against chemically synthesized phosphopeptides, FPLTS(PO3)WPCSFSPS and FPLTSWPCS(PO3)FSPS in rabbits. The antisera were further affinity-purified against the respective phosphopeptides. To study the effect of GSK-3β on GCM1 stability or compare the stability of wild-type GCM1 and its mutants harboring the S322A, S326A, or S322A/S326A mutation, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmid and siRNA as described in the figure legends. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with or without LiCl and cycloheximide for the indicated period of time and then harvested for immunoblotting with the indicated antibody. Band intensities were determined by densitometric analysis using an Eastman Kodak Co. DC290 zoom digital camera and Kodak 1D image analysis software. Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance for differences between means. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RNA was isolated using RNeasy reagents (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III reagents (Invitrogen) with an oligo(dT)20 primer. Quantification of GCM1 mRNA was preformed in the LightCycler system (Roche Applied Science) using a commercial SYBR Green reaction reagent (Qiagen). The sequences of primer sets were 5′-CCTCTCATCCTCATCAGCAAT-3′ and 5′-TCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCTGGT-3′ for HA-GCM1, 5′-CTGACAAGGCTTTTTTCTTCACA-3′ and 5′-CCAGACGGGACAGGTTT-3′ for endogenous GCM1, 5′-GCCATCAATGACCCCTTCATT-3′ and 5′-TTGACGGTGCCATGGAATTT-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 5′-AACTCCATCATGAAGTGTGACG-3′ and 5′-GATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGG-3′ for β-actin. Placental tissue samples were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for cryosectioning. Indirect immunostaining was performed as previously described (13Chen C.P. Chen C.Y. Yang Y.C. Su T.H. Chen H. Placenta. 2004; 25: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In brief, the sections were blocked with protein block (Dako, High Wycombe, UK) for 20 min and then incubated with the antibody against Ser(P)9-GSK-3β (1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline (5 min for each wash), sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Immunofluorescence was examined under a Zeiss microscope (München-Hallbergmoos) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Axiocam HRm; Zeiss) and imaging system Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). For GST pull-down experiments, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated wild-type or mutant pGCM1-FLAG plasmid. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The cell lysate was incubated with GST or GST-FBW2 prebound to glutathione beads in the lysis buffer at 4 °C for 4 h before washing three times with the lysis buffer. The proteins pulled down were analyzed by immunoblotting with FLAG mAb. Nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides corresponding to the amino acids 313–333 region of GCM1 were chemically synthesized and N-terminally conjugated with biotin. For peptide pull-down experiments, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated F-box protein expression plasmid. At 48 h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared and incubated with the indicated biotinylated peptide prebound to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) under similar conditions described above. After washing, the proteins pulled down were analyzed by immunoblotting with Myc mAb (9E10; Sigma). The development of preeclampsia is tightly associated with placental hypoxia and a disruption of the GCM1 transcription network. To investigate whether GCM1 is a critical target of placental hypoxia, we first investigated the effects of hypoxia on GCM1 expression in the placental cell lines, JAR and BeWo, and in a BeWo line (BeWo31) stably expressing HA-tagged GCM1 (HA-GCM1) under the cytomegalovirus promoter. The transcript levels of endogenous GCM1 in the three lines were significantly decreased under hypoxia (Fig. 1A, left), with a concomitant reduction in GCM1 protein levels (Fig. 1A, right). Interestingly, the protein level of ectopically expressed HA-GCM1 driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter in BeWo31 cells was also decreased under hypoxia or in the presence of the hypoxia mimic, CoCl2 (Fig. 1B). This observation was not due to a suppressive effect of hypoxia on the cytomegalovirus promoter, because comparable transcript levels of HA-GCM1 were detected in normoxic, hypoxic, and CoCl2-treated cells by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1B, right). Similar observations were also made in another HA-GCM1-expressing BeWo line, BeWo30 (data not shown). Furthermore, removal of CoCl2 restored the HA-GCM1 protein level in the CoCl2-pretreated BeWo31 cells, suggesting that the effect of hypoxia on GCM1 stability is reversible (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the hypoxia-induced loss of GCM1 could be counteracted by the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, indicating that GCM1 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in response to hypoxia (Fig. 1D). In a parallel study of GCM1 gene expression, we demonstrated that GCM1 transactivates its own promoter activity (supplementalFig. 1). Therefore, hypoxia would promote GCM1 degradation and further suppress GCM1 activity by impairing the positive feedback of GCM1 gene expression, leading to a reduction of GCM1 transcription (Fig. 1A). Recent studies have demonstrated that exposure to hypoxic conditions either activates or inactivates the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, depending on the cell type (22Alvarez-Tejado M. Alfranca A. Aragonés J. Vara A. Landázuri M.O. del Peso L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13508-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Mottet D. Dumont V. Deccache Y. Demazy C. Ninane N. Raes M. Michiels C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31277-31285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PI3K-Akt signaling pathway plays a role in hypoxia associated with preeclampsia, we analyzed the effects of hypoxia on the villous CTB cells isolated from term placentas and in human placental cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2A, the levels of activated Akt (i.e. the Ser308-phosphorylated (Ser(P)308) Akt and Ser473-phosporylated (Ser(P)473) Akt) were significantly decreased in CTB cells and three cell lines under hypoxia for 48 h. This suggests that hypoxia may suppress the activity of the Akt upstream kinase, PI3K. Indeed, LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, significantly decreased the HA-GCM1 protein level in BeWo31 under normoxia conditions (Fig. 2B), whereas rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, did not affect the HA-GCM1 protein level under similar conditions (data not shown). In support of this finding, the expression of constitutively active mutants of p110 and Akt, Myc-p110* and HA-myr-Akt, were able to enhance GCM1-mediated transcriptional activation, whereas the dominant negative mutant of Akt, Akt-KA, inhibited GCM1-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 2C). These observations might be attributed to regulation of GCM1-FLAG stability by PI3K and Akt, because the protein level of GCM1-FLAG was increased in the presence of Myc-p110* and HA-myr-Akt but decreased in the presence of Akt-KA (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results suggest that inactivation of the PI3K-Akt pathway by hypoxia promotes GCM1 degradation. Because Akt phosphorylates the Ser9 residue of GSK-3β and hence inhibits GSK-3β activity (24Flügel D. Görlach A. Michiels C. Kietzmann T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3253-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we studied whether GSK-3β regulates GCM1 stability under normoxia and hypoxia. Levels of the inhibitory Ser9-phosphorylated (Ser(P)9) GSK-3β in BeWo, BeWo31, JAR, and CTB cells fell significantly under hypoxia, whereas levels of the active Tyr216-phosporylated (Tyr(P)216) GSK-3β were not affected (Fig. 2A). Therefore, GSK-3β activity is elevated under hypoxic conditions and may be associated with GCM1 instability in placental cells. Indeed, treatment with LiCl, a GSK-3β inhibitor, was able to significantly stabilize HA-GCM1 proteins in cells treated with CoCl2 or exposed to hypoxia (Fig. 2D). Since placental hypoxia is associated with preeclampsia, the expression of GCM1 and Ser(P)9-GSK-3β in preeclamptic placentas was compared with that in gestation age-matched normal placentas by immunohistochemistry. In agreement with our previous study (13Chen C.P. Chen C.Y. Yang Y.C. Su T.H. Chen H. Placenta. 2004; 25: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), expression of GCM1 was decreased in preeclamptic placentas (supplementalFig. 2). Interestingly, the expression of Ser(P)9-GSK-3β in preeclamptic placentas was also decreased compared with that in normal placentas (Fig. 2E). Therefore, a relatively higher GSK-3β activity in preeclamptic placentas may be responsible for decreasing the GCM1 protein level in preeclampsia. We next tested whether GSK-3β regulates GCM1 ubiquitination, which targets GCM1 to proteasomes for degradation (18Yang C.S. Yu C. Chuang H.C. Chang C.W. Chang G.D. Yao T.P. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10083-10090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In vivo ubiquitination of GCM1 was analyzed in 293T cells cotransfected with pHA-Ub, pGCM1-FLAG, and an expression plasmid encoding the wild-type, kinase-dead (KD) or constitutively active (CA) GSK-3β. As shown on the left in Fig. 3A, the level of ubiquitinated GCM1-FLAG was decreased in the presence of the KD GSK-3β. In addition, knocking down the endogenous GSK-3β with a GSK-3β siRNA, but not an unrelated GL2 siRNA, also prevented GCM1 ubiquitination (Fig. 3A, right). Using cycloheximide to inhibit de novo protein synthesis, we further found that the half-life of GCM1-FLAG was prolonged to over 6 h in the LiCl-treated or GSK-3β siRNA-transfected cells but not in the mock-treated or GL2 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that active GSK-3β promotes GCM1 ubiquitination and degradation. A series of GCM1 mutants on potential GSK-3β phosphorylation sites in GCM1 were generated and tested in in vivo ubiquitination assays in order to identify the functional GSK-3β sites in GCM1. As shown in Fig. 4A, changing Ser322 or Ser326 into alanine (i.e. mutants GCM1-FLAG-S322A and GCM1-FLAG-S326A) significantly impaired GCM1 ubiquitination. Moreover, the half-lives of both single mutants and the mutant harboring the double mutation of Ser322 and Ser326 (GCM1-FLAG-SSAA; SSAA) were significantly prolonged (Fig. 4B). The F-box protein, FBW2, is the substrate recognition subunit of the SCFFBW2 E3 ligase responsible for GCM1 ubiquitination (18Yang C.S. Yu C. Chuang H.C. Chang C.W. Chang G.D. Yao T.P. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10083-10090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether recognition of GCM1 by FBW2 depends on the phosphorylation status of Ser322 and Ser326. In pull-down experiments with GST-FBW2 and cell lysate from 293T cells expressing wild-type or mutant GCM1-FLAG harboring an individual or combined mutation in Ser322 and Ser326, interaction between FBW2 and the mutants S322A, S326A, and S322A/S326A was not detected (Fig. 4C). However, FBW2 did interact with the wild-type GCM1-FLAG and the mutant S322E, where Ser322 was changed into glutamic acid (Fig. 4C). As a complementary study, biotin-conjugated GCM1 peptides of amino acids 313–333 harboring unmodified or phosphorylated Ser322 and Ser326 were synthesized for pull-down experiments with different F-box proteins, including FBW2, βTrcp, and SKP2. As shown in Fig. 4D, neither mock beads nor unmodified peptide-loaded beads pulled down any of the three F-box proteins transiently expressed in 293T cells. However, when a peptide harboring both phospho-Ser322 and -Ser326 residues was tested, an interaction with FBW2 was observed (Fig. 4D). Therefore, phosphorylation of Ser322 and Ser326 forms a C-terminal destruction motif in GCM1 that permits interaction with FBW2. Phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were generated to investigate the physiological relevance of Ser322 and Ser326 phosphorylation sites (Ser(P)322 and Ser(P)326) in GCM1 (supplementalFig. 3). With Ser(P)322-GCM1 antibody, we demonstrated that GSK-3β is involved in Ser322 phosphorylation in GCM1 in vivo, because the level of Ser(P)322-HA-GCM1 was significantly decreased in GSK-3β-knocked down and MG132-treated 293T cells (Fig. 5A). We further demonstrated that hypoxia stimulates Ser322 phosphorylation in BeWo31 placental cells (Fig. 5B, left), which could be counteracted by LiCl (Fig. 5B, right), supporting a requirement of GSK-3β for Ser322 phosphorylation under hypoxia. Similar results were also observed in JAR cells stably expressing HA-GCM1 (data not shown). Interestingly, the level of Ser(P)326-HA-GCM1 was not significantly different in BeWo31 cells under normoxia or hypoxia (Fig. 5B). Therefore, Ser326 is likely to be constitutively phosphorylated and to function as the priming phosphate for GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of Ser322 in GCM1 in placental cells. Overall, these results indicate that phosphorylation of Ser322 and Ser326 in GCM1 is critical for its degradation under hypoxia. GCM1 is a critical transcription factor for placental development and function. Previous studies have demonstrated that GCM1 expression is decreased in preeclamptic placentas and placental cells under hypoxia (13Chen C.P. Chen C.Y. Yang Y.C. Su T.H. Chen H. Placenta. 2004; 25: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Knerr I. Schubert S.W. Wich C. Amann K. Aigner T. Vogler T. Jung R. Dötsch J. Rascher W. Hashemolhosseini S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3991-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we wished to investigate in the present study how hypoxia regulates GCM1 expression in the placenta. One of the major cellular responses to hypoxia is expression of genes involved in glycolysis, glucose transport, erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIF is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of HIFα and the arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT; also known as HIF1β). Interestingly, transgenic mice studies have indicated that HIF1α, HIF2α, and ARNT are required for placental development (26Adelman D.M. Gertsenstein M. Nagy A. Simon M.C. Maltepe E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3191-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 27Cowden Dahl K.D. Fryer B.H. Mack F.A. Compernolle V. Maltepe E. Adelman D.M. Carmeliet P. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10479-10491Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Studies of trophoblast stem (TS) cells derived from wild-type, ARNT−/−, and HIF1α−/− HIF2α−/− placentas further suggested that HIF is involved in the differentiation of trophoblast giant cells. In addition, HIF-null TS cells predominantly differentiated into syncytiotrophoblasts (26Adelman D.M. Gertsenstein M. Nagy A. Simon M.C. Maltepe E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3191-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 27Cowden Dahl K.D. Fryer B.H. Mack F.A. Compernolle V. Maltepe E. Adelman D.M. Carmeliet P. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell.

Development. 2005; 132: 3393-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we had investigated the role of HIF in GCM1 gene expression when this study was initiated and did not detect any direct effect of HIF1 on GCM1 gene expression (data not shown). Instead, we found that GCM1 autoregulates its promoter activity (supplementalFig. 1). Subsequently, we demonstrated that hypoxia down-regulates GCM1 activity at both transcriptional and post-translational levels by enhancing GCM1 degradation (Fig. 1). Recent studies have demonstrated that proteasome-mediated degradation of estrogen receptor α is induced by hypoxia via protein-protein interaction between estrogen receptor α and HIF1α (29Stoner M. Saville B. Wormke M. Dean D. Burghardt R. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2231-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Cho J. Kim D. Lee S. Lee Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the possibility of protein-protein interaction between GCM1 and HIF1α and did not detect any interaction between HIF1α and GCM1 (data not shown). Moreover, we have also tested whether hypoxia regulates GCM1 degradation through activation of FBW2 and UBE2D2 gene expression, which are the E3 and E2 components for the proteasome-dependent degradation of GCM1, respectively (31Chiang M.H. Chen L.F. Chen H. Biol. Reprod. 2008; 79: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that expression of the FBW2 and UBE2D2 genes was not affected by hypoxia (data not shown). Because GCM1 autoregulates its own expression and hypoxia induces GCM1 degradation, the BeWo31 placental cells stably expressing HA-GCM1 provided a good system for further mechanistic study of hypoxia-induced GCM1 degradation at the post-translational level, because expression of HA-GCM1 is directed by the cytomegalovirus promoter, whose activity is not affected by hypoxia. We then came to investigate whether the hypoxia signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of GCM1 stability. Depending on the cell type, hypoxia either activates or inactivates the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. For example, the pathway is activated in PC12, HT1080, and HeLa cells (22Alvarez-Tejado M.

Biol. 2007; 27: 3253-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) under hypoxia. Although the mechanism of activation or inhibition of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by hypoxia is not known, in the present study, we clearly demonstrated that this pathway is inhibited in BeWo, BeWo31, and JAR placental cells and primary cytotrophoblast cells under hypoxia (Fig. 2A). We further demonstrated that the level of the inhibitory form of GSK-3β, Ser(P)9-GSK-3β, is decreased when the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is inhibited by hypoxia or in preeclamptic placentas. Consequently, the activated GSK-3β phosphorylates Ser322 in GCM1 and promotes GCM1 degradation. Our results are also in agreement with a recent study by Yung et al. (34Yung H.W. Calabrese S. Hynx D. Hemmings B.A. Cetin I. Charnock-Jones D.S. Burton G.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 173: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), in which inactivation of Akt and activation of GSK-3β were found to be associated with protein synthesis inhibition and endoplasmic reticulum stress in placentas of intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia. Therefore, GSK-3β is a target of placental stress, and overactivated GSK-3β is very likely to cause dysregulation of protein translation, modification, and degradation in the pathogenesis of intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia. Maternal obesity and insulin resistance before pregnancy, allelic polymorphism at the Thr235 residue of angiotensinogen, food shortage, induction of autoantibodies against angiotensin II type 1 receptor, and abnormal expression of angiogenic factors (sFlt-1, VEGF, and PGF) are all linked to preeclampsia (1Maynard S. Epstein F.H. Karumanchi S.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 2008; 59: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 35Ilekis J.V. Reddy U.M. Roberts J.M. Reprod. Sci. 2007; 14: 508-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have shown that both deficiency in 2-methoxyoestradiol production in catechol-O-methyltransferase knock-out mice and administration of purified autoantibodies against angiotensin II type 1 receptor into pregnant mice result in the development of preeclampsia (36Zhou C.C.

Given that different factors are associated with preeclampsia, it occurs only during pregnancy, and its symptoms are resolved after delivery, it is very likely that the pathogenesis of this disease involves many regulatory systems, and dysfunction of any of these systems leads to placental insufficiency and development of the symptoms. Expression of PGF and VEGF was found in villous trophoblasts and may regulate vessel formation in the chorionic villi (38Benirschke K. Kaufmann P. Pathology of the Human Placenta. 4th Ed. Springer-Verlag, New York, NY2001: 134-145Google Scholar, 39Zhou Y. McMaster M. Woo K. Janatpour M. Perry J. Karpanen T. Alitalo K. Damsky C. Fisher S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1405-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). PGF and VEGF expression was also detected in the invading CTBs, which invade and replace the endothelial cells in spiral arteries to achieve maternal vascular remodeling (40Zhou Y. Bellingard V. Feng K.T. McMaster M. Fisher S.J. Dev. Biol. 2003; 263: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Decreased circulating levels of VEGF and PGF have been demonstrated in preeclampsia and may account for endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia (6Simas T.A. Crawford S.L. Solitro M.J. Frost S.C.

Trophoblastic fusion is essential for the functional integrity of the syncytiotrophoblast layer, which very likely involves the fusogenic proteins syncytin 1 and 2. Syncytin 2 is a second placental fusogenic protein with an immunosuppressive activity (41Mangeney M. Renard M. Schlecht-Louf G. Bouallaga I. Heidmann O. Letzelter C. Richaud A. Ducos B. Heidmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20534-20539Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Expression of syncytin 2 is also regulated by GCM1 (data not shown) and is decreased in preeclampsia (42Chen C.P. Chen L.F. Yang S.R. Chen C.Y. Ko C.C. Chang G.D. Chen H. Biol. Reprod. 2008; 79: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Decreased expression of both fusogenic proteins in hypoxic conditions and preeclampsia may be responsible for the unstable villous structures and increased trophoblast deportation into the maternal circulation found in preeclampsia. Likewise, misexpression under placental hypoxia of the other genes regulated by GCM1, such as aromatase, may also contribute to placental insufficiency, leading to preeclampsia (43Yamada K. Ogawa H. Honda S. Harada N. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32279-32286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on the signaling pathway underlying hypoxia-induced GCM1 degradation, here we propose a model for the role of GCM1 in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. GCM1 is increasingly subject to degradation under placental hypoxia. GCM1 gene expression is compromised due to impaired autoregulation of GCM1 gene expression. This feedback loop leads to a significant reduction of GCM1 under hypoxia. Reduced GCM1 levels caused a broad failure in the expression of GCM1 target genes, resulting in placental insufficiency (Fig. 5C). In particular, the misexpression of proangiogenic factors and fusogenic proteins is very likely to cause endothelial dysfunction and improper formation of the syncytiotrophoblast layer in the preeclamptic placentas. Being a key placental transcription factor, the activity of GCM1 can be regulated by different post-translational modifications, which may fine tune placental development and function. For example, the cAMP-PKA pathway is able to enhance CBP-mediated acetylation of GCM1, which prevents GCM1 ubiquitination and thereby increases GCM1 activity (20Chang C.W. Chuang H.C. Yu C. Yao T.P. Chen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8401-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we have revealed a further new pathway responsible for decreased GCM1 activity in placental cells under hypoxia (i.e. activation of the hypoxia-PI3K-Akt-GSK-3β pathway leads to GCM1 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation). This pathway is very likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and provides an opportunity for therapeutic intervention in preeclampsia.

https://openalex.org/W2030392188,"NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is an essential cofactor involved in various biological processes including calorie restriction-mediated life span extension. Administration of nicotinamide riboside (NmR) has been shown to ameliorate deficiencies related to aberrant NAD+ metabolism in both yeast and mammalian cells. However, the biological role of endogenous NmR remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that salvaging endogenous NmR is an integral part of NAD+ metabolism. A balanced NmR salvage cycle is essential for calorie restriction-induced life span extension and stress resistance in yeast. Our results also suggest that partitioning of the pyridine nucleotide flux between the classical salvage cycle and the NmR salvage branch might be modulated by the NAD+-dependent Sir2 deacetylase. Furthermore, two novel deamidation steps leading to nicotinic acid mononucleotide and nicotinic acid riboside production are also uncovered that further underscore the complexity and flexibility of NAD+ metabolism. In addition, utilization of extracellular nicotinamide mononucleotide requires prior conversion to NmR mediated by a periplasmic phosphatase Pho5. Conversion to NmR may thus represent a strategy for the transport and assimilation of large nonpermeable NAD+ precursors. Together, our studies provide a molecular basis for how NAD+ homeostasis factors confer metabolic flexibility.

Conversion to NmR may thus represent a strategy for the transport and assimilation of large nonpermeable NAD+ precursors. Together, our studies provide a molecular basis for how NAD+ homeostasis factors confer metabolic flexibility. The pyridine nucleotide NAD+ and its reduced form NADH are primary redox carriers involved in metabolism. In addition to serving as a coenzyme in redox reactions, NAD+ also acts as a cosubstrate in protein modification reactions including deacetylation and ADP-ribosylation (1Lin S.J. Guarente L.

Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). CR is the most effective regimen known to extend life span in various species (5Weindruch W. Walford R.L. The Retardation of Aging and Diseases by Dietary Restriction. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL1998Google Scholar, 6Roth G.S. Ingram D.K. Lane M.A. Ann. N.Y. Acad.

The Retardation of Aging and Diseases by Dietary Restriction. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL1998Google Scholar). The Sir2 family proteins are NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases, which have been shown to play important roles in several CR models in yeast (3Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 7Easlon E. Tsang F. Dilova I. Wang C. Lu S.P. Skinner C. Lin S.J. J. Biol.

By coupling the cleavage of NAD+ and deacetylation of target proteins, the Sir2 family proteins serve as a molecular link relaying the cellular energy state to the machinery of life span regulation. Mammalian Sir2 family proteins (SIRT1–7) have also been implicated in stress response, cell survival, and insulin and fat metabolism (8Dilova I. Easlon E. Lin S.J. Cell Mol.

In eukaryotes, NAD+ is generated by de novo synthesis and by salvaging various intermediary precursors (see Fig. 1A). In yeast, the de novo pathway is mediated by Bna1–5 and Qpt1 (Bna6), which produces nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) from tryptophan (11Panozzo C. Nawara M. Suski C. Kucharczyka R. Skoneczny M. Bécam A.M. Rytka J. Herbert C.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because the de novo pathway requires molecular oxygen as a substrate, cells grown under anaerobic growth conditions would rely on exogenous NAD+ precursors for the nicotinamide (Nam) moiety (11Panozzo C. Nawara M. Suski C. Kucharczyka R. Skoneczny M. Bécam A.M. Rytka J. Herbert C.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Yeast cells also salvage Nam from NAD+ consuming reactions or nicotinic acid (NA) from environment via Tna1, Pnc1, and Npt1, leading to NaMN production. NaMN is then converted to NAD+ via Nma1/2 and Qns1 (see Fig. 1A). Nma1/2 are adenylyltransferases with dual specificity toward NMN and NaMN (12Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Lorenzi M. Raffaelli N. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Emanuelli M. Amici A. Carnevali F. Pierella F. Raffaelli N. Magni G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 27: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and Qns1 is a glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase. Recent studies also showed that supplementing nicotinamide riboside (NmR) and nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) to growth medium rescued the lethality of NAD+ auxotrophic mutants (14Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Cell. 2004; 117: 495-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 15Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C.

Assimilations of exogenous NmR and NaR are mainly mediated by a conserved NmR kinase (Nrk1) and three nucleosidases (Urh1, Pnp1, and Meu1). Nrk1 phosphorylates NmR and NaR to produce nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and NaMN, respectively (14Bieganowski P. Brenner C.

We also determined the biological significance of salvaging endogenous NmR and studied its role in CR-induced life span extension. Moreover, we demonstrated that the NmR salvage machinery was also required for utilizing exogenous NMN, which has recently been shown to increase NAD+ levels in mammalian cells (24Revollo J.R.

Finally, we discussed the role of Sir2 in modulating the flux of pyridine nucleotides between alternate routes. Yeast strain BY4742 MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 was acquired from Open Biosystems (25Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2613) Google Scholar). Rich media YPD and synthetic media SD were made as described (26Burke D. Dawson D. Sterns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 171-174Google Scholar). The growth medium used for replicative life span analysis was YPD (2% bacto peptone, 1% yeast extract, 1.5% agar) supplemented with filter-sterilized glucose at a final concentration of 2 or 0.5%. Growth medium used for chronological life span analysis was either YPD or SD (supplemented with 4× auxotrophic amino acids leucine, histidine, lysine, and uracil). All gene deletions were made by replacing wild type genes with a reusable loxP-Kanr-loxP marker as described (27Güldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar) and verified by PCR using oligonucleotides flanking genes of interest. Multiple deletions were carried out by popping out the Kanr marker using a galactose inducible Cre-recombinase. The Nrk1 overexpression construct was made as follows: a pair of oligonucleotides adding a NotI site to the 5′ end and a NheI site to the 3′ end of the NRK1 gene was designed to amplify the coding region of NRK1 via PCR. After PCR amplification, DNA was digested with NotI and NheI and then cloned into ppp81 (7Easlon E. Tsang F. Dilova I. Wang C. Lu S.P. Skinner C. Lin S.J. J. Biol.

Anaerobic growth conditions were achieved by using the BBL GasPak anaerobic chamber system. Total intracellular levels of NAD+ were determined using enzymatic cycling reaction as described (7Easlon E. Tsang F. Dilova I. Wang C. Lu S.P. Skinner C. Lin S.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 387: 2441-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) at the metabolomics core laboratory at University of California, Davis. The cell extracts were prepared from 1010 cells grown to late log phase by beads beating in ice-cold 50 mm ammonium acetate solution (29Sporty J.L. Kabir M.M. Turteltaub K.W. Ognibene T. Lin S.J. Bench G. J. Sep. Sci. 2008; 31: 3202-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants (50 ml) were collected and lyophilized along with cell extracts at −80 °C. Lyophilized products were resuspended in 100 μl (cell lysate) or 2 ml (culture supernatant) of 13 mm ammonium acetate/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v). 10 μl was used for LC-MS analysis. Chemically synthesized NmR and NaR, which were kindly provided by Dr. A. Sauve (30Yang T. Chan N.Y. Sauve A.A. J. Med. Chem. 2007; 50: 6458-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), were used to establish standard curves. Detection and quantification of NmR and NaR were performed using the MS-multiple reaction mode methods (NmR, retention time 6 min; NaR, retention time 8 min). Four single colonies from each strain were analyzed in each experiment as described (31Fabrizio P. Longo V.D. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. The cells were grown in YPD or SD supplemented with 2 or 0.5% glucose at starting A600 of 0.1. The cells were grown in 50-ml tubes on a roller drum set at maximum speed to ensure proper aeration. After 2 days, the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with sterile water. The cells were then resuspended in 10 ml of sterile water to A600 of 1 and then were incubated at 30 °C. Cell viability was monitored every 1–2 days by plating a fraction of culture onto fresh growth medium to determine the colony-forming units. The cell survival rate was calculated by normalizing the colony-forming units to the cell number obtained at day 2 (maximum A600). The cells were grown in SD at a starting A600 of 0.1. After 2 days, the cells were spotted onto YPD plates in 5-fold serial dilutions (started at A600 of 1) and then were incubated at 55 or 25 °C for 45 or 60 min. After heat shock, the plates were transferred to 30 °C for another 2–3 days. All RLS analyses were carried out on YPD plates supplemented with glucose at a final concentration of 2 or 0.5% with 50 cells/strain/experiment (7Easlon E. Tsang F. Dilova I. Wang C. Lu S.P.

Statistical analysis was carried out using the JMP statistics software (SAS), and the Wilcoxon rank sum test p values were calculated for each pair of life spans. 300 A600 unit cells grown overnight in YPD were harvested, and cell lysate was obtained by beads beating in breaking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, Roche protease inhibitors). Cell lysate containing 80 μg of total cellular proteins was added to 300 μl of deamidase reaction mix (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) (32Ghislain M. Talla E. François J.M.

The amount of ammonia was calculated by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm using standard curve derived from the ammonia standard solutions (Sigma). Yeast cells lacking both the NPT1 and QPT1 genes or the QNS1 gene are inviable in regular growth media because a functional salvage or de novo NAD+ biosynthesis pathway is essential for growth (Fig. 1A) (3Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 14Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Cell. 2004; 117: 495-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Our previous studies (3Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar) led to a fortuitous discovery that the lethality of the npt1Δqpt1Δ and qns1Δ mutants could be rescued by growing these cells adjacent to wild type (WT) cells (Fig. 1B, left panel). These data suggested that NAD+ prototrophic yeast cells (feeders) constantly released certain NAD+ precursors, which rendered the growth of NAD+ auxotrophic cells (recipients) via cross-feeding (Fig. 1B, right panel). Because NmR supplementation could rescue the lethality of the qns1Δ mutant (14Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Cell. 2004; 117: 495-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), it was possible that WT cells cross-fed the npt1Δqpt1Δ and the qns1Δ mutants with NmR. We first examined whether cross-feeding would be prevented by deleting NRK1 (NmR kinase) in recipient cells. Anaerobic growth conditions (−O2) were utilized to block de novo NAD+ biosynthesis (11Panozzo C. Nawara M. Suski C. Kucharczyka R. Skoneczny M. Bécam A.M. Rytka J. Herbert C.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in the npt1Δ mutants. As shown in Fig. 1C, npt1Δ cells grown anaerobically became auxotrophic for NAD+, and as expected, utilization of exogenous NmR required functional Nrk1 (Fig. 1C, left panel). Nrk1 was also required for the npt1Δ mutant to utilize cross-feeding molecules released by WT cells (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, deleting NmR assimilation enzymes Nrk1, Urh1, and Pnp1 in WT cells dramatically enhanced cross-feeding activity (Fig. 1E, left panel). Conversely, overexpressing NRK1 reduced the cross-feeding ability of WT cells (Fig. 1E, right panel). Interestingly, preventing NmR import by deleting NmR transporters NRT1 and FUN26 also conferred strong cross-feeding (Fig. 1E, middle panel), indicating that yeast cells constantly released NmR. Together, these data showed that cross-feeding activity of the feeder cells appeared to be inversely correlated with NmR salvage and import activities, supporting NmR as the major released NAD+ precursor that rescued the lethality of recipients. To understand the significance of the NmR pool, we first exploited our cross-feeding reporter system to determine the amount of NmR released by WT and NmR assimilation mutants. Fractions of cell-free culture supernatants of the feeders were collected to supplement the recipients. Fig. 2A showed that the magnitude of cross-feeding conferred by the supernatants of WT and nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ and nrt1Δfun26Δ mutants in liquid culture-based assays was correlated with that determined by agar plate-based assays (Fig. 1E). Using a standard curve derived from defined concentrations of NmR and their corresponding abilities to support growth of the recipients (supplemental Fig. S1), the cumulative concentration of NmR released by the nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant was estimated to be ∼6.74 μm. The amount of NmR released by each nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant cell was about 250 × 10−10 nmol (∼0.3 mm). For comparison, the level of total NAD+ in a WT cell was ∼840 × 10−10 nmol (1.2 mm) (see Fig. 4B). These data highlighted the significance of the NmR pool in NAD+ metabolism.FIGURE 4Analyses of NmR release and NAD+ levels in the NA/Nam salvage mutants. A, the level of NmR released by the npt1Δ mutant is extremely low. The qpt1Δ mutant releases WT-level NmR. B, comparisons of the extent of NmR release (cross-feeding activities) and NAD+ levels in the NA/Nam salvage mutants. Upward arrows, increased NmR release; downward arrows, decreased NmR release; N, normal. The width of the arrows indicates the extent of NmR release compared with WT. One set of representative experiments conducted in triplicate is shown. The error bars denote standard deviations. The p values are calculated using Student's t test (***: p < 0.005). C, inactivation of NmR assimilating enzymes partially restores NmR release in the npt1Δ mutant (left panel). Deleting Sir2 slightly increases NmR release in WT (right panel) and further increases NmR release in the npt1Δnrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant (left panel). The npt1Δqpt1Δ mutant is used as recipient in all cross-feeding assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next directly quantitated the levels of intracellular and released NmR by LC-MS. Cell extracts (intracellular fractions) and culture supernatants (extracellular fractions) of WT and the nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant were prepared and analyzed as described (28Chen P. Wolf W.R. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2007; 387: 2441-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Sporty J.L. Kabir M.M. Turteltaub K.W. Ognibene T. Lin S.J. Bench G. J. Sep. Sci. 2008; 31: 3202-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, NmR was detected in the intracellular fractions of WT and the nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant, which confirmed that NmR was an endogenous metabolite. As expected, the concentrations of both intracellular and released NmR were higher in the nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant compared with WT (Fig. 2C, left panel). In both strains, extracellular concentrations of NmR were maintained at much lower levels compared with the intracellular fractions, indicating that NmR transporters Nrt1 and Fun26 efficiently retrieved NmR back to the cell. Fig. 2C (right panel) showed that the amount of NmR released by each nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ cell was ∼40-fold higher than that of WT cell. Overall, results obtained by LC-MS analysis correlated well with results acquired by cross-feeding assays (Figs. 1E and 2A). It has been reported that exogenous NaR could function as a NAD+ precursor, which also relied on Nrk1 and Urh1/Pnp1/Meu1 for assimilation (16Tempel W. Rabeh W.M. Bogan K.L. Belenky P. Wojcik M. Seidle H.F. Nedyalkova L. Yang T. Sauve A.A. Park H.W. Brenner C. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e263Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether NaR was also present in the intracellular and the extracellular fractions. Interestingly, intracellular concentrations of NaR were higher (∼6-fold) than NmR in both WT and the nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant (Fig. 2D, left panel). However, extracellular NaR concentrations were extremely low in both strains. Consistent with a recent study (21Belenky P. Christensen K.C. Gazzaniga F. Pletnev A.A. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 158-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we found that NaR was a much less efficient (∼100-fold less) NAD+ precursor supplement compared with NmR (supplemental Fig. S2). This was likely due to inefficient transport of NaR across the cell membrane (21Belenky P. Christensen K.C. Gazzaniga F. Pletnev A.A. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 158-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Collectively, our in vivo cross-feeding data and LC-MS quantitative results provide evidence that both NmR and NaR are endogenous metabolites. Because most NaR is retained intracellularly, NmR is likely the key NAD+ precursor that rescues the growth of recipients. The constant release and re-uptake cycle of NmR may represent a novel extended pool of NAD+. We next determined whether deficiencies in salvaging endogenous NmR would cause any growth defects. Because NmR was mainly produced during late log phase (Fig. 2B), NmR salvage might be central for cell survival in the stationary phase. Yeast chronological life span (CLS) is defined as the length of time cells remain viable in a nondividing state (stationary phase or post-diauxic shift) and is suggested to be a model for studying life span regulation of post-mitotic cells in metazoan (31Fabrizio P. Longo V.D. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant displayed short CLS. CR-induced CLS extension was largely abolished in the nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant. The nrt1Δfun26Δ mutant showed moderate decrease in CLS. However, CR-induced CLS extension was not affected in this mutant (Fig. 3A). NmR supplement has been shown to restore the NAD+ level and the life span of cells grown in media lacking NA (15Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, NA supplement failed to rescue the short CLS of the nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant (Fig. 3B), indicating that NmR salvage played a more important role than the classical NA/Nam salvage in CLS. Yeast CLS extension has been attributed to enhanced stress resistance (31Fabrizio P. Longo V.D. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 34Fabrizio P. Pozza F. Pletcher S.D. Gendron C.M. Longo V.D. Science. 2001; 292: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 35Powers 3rd, R.W. Kaeberlein M. Caldwell S.D. Kennedy B.K. Fields S.

Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 265-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In line with these studies, the nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ and the nrt1Δfun26Δ mutants were sensitive to heat shock stress (Fig. 3, C and D). Also consistent with CLS shown in Fig. 3A, CR-induced heat resistance was abolished in the nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant (Fig. 3C) but was unaffected in the nrt1Δfun26Δ mutant (Fig. 3D). We next examined whether NmR salvage was also required for the CR-induced RLS (division potential of individual cells) extension. As shown in Fig. 3E, CR-induced RLS extension was completely abolished in the nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutant and was only partially prevented in the nrt1Δfun26Δ mutant. Collectively, our data demonstrated that the severity of growth defects observed in the nrt1Δfun26Δ and nrk1Δurh1Δpnp1Δ mutants correlated with the amount of NmR released (Fig. 2A) and that NmR assimilation was essential for CR-induced benefits. We next investigated the endogenous sources of NmR. Because the nicotinamide moiety of NmR is likely to originate from de novo synthesis or NA/Nam-mediated salvage (Fig. 1A), we compared the cross-feeding activities of the qpt1Δ and npt1Δ mutants. As shown in Fig. 4A, the npt1Δ mutant was unable to cross-feed the recipients, whereas the qpt1Δ mutant exhibited similar cross-feeding ability as the WT cells, suggesting that NA/Nam-mediated salvage was required for NmR production. However, it was also possible that in the npt1Δ mutant, NmR assimilation was activated, thereby resulting in decreased NmR levels. Deleting NmR assimilation enzymes in the npt1Δ mutant only slightly restored NmR release (Fig. 4C). Therefore, NmR production was indeed compromised in the npt1Δ mutant. Because the level of NAD+ in"
https://openalex.org/W2121930443,"An association between enrichment and depletion of microRNA (miRNA) binding sites, 3′ UTR length, and mRNA expression has been demonstrated in various developing tissues and tissues from different mature organs; but functional, context-dependent miRNA regulations have yet to be elucidated. Towards that goal, we examined miRNA–mRNA interactions by measuring miRNA and mRNA in the same tissue during development and also in malignant conditions. We identified significant miRNA-mediated biological process categories in developing mouse cerebellum and lung using non-targeted mRNA expression as the negative control. Although miRNAs in general suppress target mRNA messages, many predicted miRNA targets demonstrate a significantly higher level of co-expression than non-target genes in developing cerebellum. This phenomenon is tissue specific since it is not observed in developing lungs. Comparison of mouse cerebellar development and medulloblastoma demonstrates a shared miRNA–mRNA co-expression program for brain-specific neurologic processes such as synaptic transmission and exocytosis, in which miRNA target expression increases with the accumulation of multiple miRNAs in developing cerebellum and decreases with the loss of these miRNAs in brain tumors. These findings demonstrate the context-dependence of miRNA–mRNA co-expression."
https://openalex.org/W2133329309,"The Cre-loxP system has been used to enable tissue specific activation, inactivation and mutation of many genes in vivo and has thereby greatly facilitated the genetic dissection of several cellular and developmental processes. In such studies, Cre-reporter strains, which carry a Cre-activated marker gene, are frequently utilized to validate the expression profile of Cre transgenes, to act as a surrogate marker for excision of a second allele, and to irreversibly label cells for lineage tracing experiments.We have studied three commonly used Cre-reporter strains, Z/AP, Z/EG and R26R-EYFP and have demonstrated that although each reporter can be reliably activated by Cre during early development, exposure to Cre in adult hematopoietic cells results in a much lower frequency of marker-positive cells in the Z/AP or Z/EG strains than in the R26R-EYFP strain. In marker negative cells derived from the Z/AP and Z/EG strains, the transgenic promoter is methylated and Cre-mediated recombination of the locus is inhibited.These results show that the efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination is not only dependent on the genomic context of a given loxP-flanked sequence, but also on stochastic epigenetic mechanisms underlying transgene variegation. Furthermore, our data highlights the potential shortcomings of utilizing the Z/AP and Z/EG reporters as surrogate markers of excision or in lineage tracing experiments."

One gene implicated in susceptibility to TB is that encoding interleukin-10 (IL10). In a group of 2010 Ghanaian patients with pulmonary TB and 2346 healthy controls exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, among them 129 individuals lacking a tuberculin skin test (PPD) response, we genotyped four IL10 promoter variants at positions -2849 , -1082 , -819 , and -592 and reconstructed the haplotypes. The IL10 low-producer haplotype -2849A/-1082A/-819C/-592C, compared to the high-producer haplotype -2849G/-1082G/-819C/-592C, occurred less frequent among PPD-negative controls than among cases (OR 2.15, CI 1.3-3.6) and PPD-positive controls (OR 2.09, CI 1.2-3.5). Lower IL-10 plasma levels in homozygous -2849A/-1082A/-819C/-592C carriers, compared to homozygous -2849G/-1082G/-819C/-592C carriers, were confirmed by a IL-10 ELISA (p = 0.016). Although we did not observe differences between the TB patients and all controls, our results provide evidence that a group of individuals exposed to M. tuberculosis transmission is genetically distinct from healthy PPD positives and TB cases. In these PPD-negative individuals, higher IL-10 production appears to reflect IL-10-dependent suppression of adaptive immune responses and sustained long-term specific anergy."
https://openalex.org/W2133088935,"The role of 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of FOXO forkhead transcription factors is at least 2-fold. First, the 14-3-3 binding inhibits the interaction between the FOXO and the target DNA. Second, the 14-3-3 proteins prevent nuclear reimport of FOXO factors by masking their nuclear localization signal. The exact mechanisms of these processes are still unclear, mainly due to the lack of structural data. In this work, we used fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the mechanism of the 14-3-3 protein-dependent inhibition of FOXO4 DNA-binding properties. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements revealed that the 14-3-3 binding affects fluorescence properties of 5-(((acetylamino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid moiety attached at four sites within the forkhead domain of FOXO4 that represent important parts of the DNA binding interface. Observed changes in 5-(((acetylamino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid fluorescence strongly suggest physical contacts between the 14-3-3 protein and labeled parts of the FOXO4 DNA binding interface. The 14-3-3 protein binding, however, does not cause any dramatic conformational change of FOXO4 as documented by the results of tryptophan fluorescence experiments. To build a realistic model of the FOXO4.14-3-3 complex, we measured six distances between 14-3-3 and FOXO4 using Förster resonance energy transfer time-resolved fluorescence experiments. The model of the complex suggests that the forkhead domain of FOXO4 is docked within the central channel of the 14-3-3 protein dimer, consistent with our hypothesis that 14-3-3 masks the DNA binding interface of FOXO4."
https://openalex.org/W2138539526,"We investigated the role of Lef1, one of the four transcription factors that transmit Wnt signaling to the genome, in the regulation of bone mass. Microcomputed tomographic analysis of 13- and 17-week-old mice revealed significantly reduced trabecular bone mass in Lef1+/− females compared to littermate wild-type females. This was attributable to decreased osteoblast activity and bone formation as indicated by histomorphometric analysis of bone remodeling. In contrast to females, bone mass was unaffected by Lef1 haploinsufficiency in males. Similarly, females were substantially more responsive than males to haploinsufficiency in Gsk3β, a negative regulator of the Wnt pathway, displaying in this case a high bone mass phenotype. Lef1 haploinsufficiency also led to low bone mass in males lacking functional androgen receptor (AR) (tfm mutants). The protective skeletal effect of AR against Wnt-related low bone mass is not necessarily a result of direct interaction between the AR and Wnt signaling pathways, because Lef1+/− female mice had normal bone mass at the age of 34 weeks. Thus, our results indicate an age- and gender-dependent role for Lef1 in regulating bone formation and bone mass in vivo. The resistance to Lef1 haploinsufficiency in males with active AR and in old females could be due to the reduced bone turnover in these mice."

Eubacteria are unique in their ability to synthesize Q. As part of this biosynthetic process, the eubacterial tRNA guanine transglycosylase (TGT) enzyme inserts the Q precursor molecule, 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ1) into tRNA, which is then converted to Q by two further enzymatic steps at the tRNA level (6.Iwata-Reuyl D. Bioorg. Chem. 2003; 31: 24-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

In contrast to the eubacterial enzyme, which is a single protein species, purification of the eukaryotic TGT suggested that the catalytically active enzyme is a heterodimeric molecule: subunits of 60 and 43 kDa in rabbit erythrocytes (16.Howes N.K. Farkas W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 9082-9087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 66 and 32 kDa in bovine liver (17.Slany R.K. Müller S.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), 60 and 34.5 kDa in rat liver (18.Morris R.C. Brooks B.J. Eriotou P. Kelly D.F. Sagar S. Hart K.L. Elliott M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2492-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and a homodimer of two 68-kDa proteins in wheat germ (16.Howes N.K. Farkas W.R. J. Biol.

A partial amino acid sequence was recovered from two of these active enzyme preparations. The identity of the proteins from bovine liver (17.Slany R.K. Müller S.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) could not be assigned at the time of publication. However, our searches show that the peptides from the larger 65-kDa subunit are identical to asparaginyl tRNA synthetase, and those of the smaller 32-kDa subunit correspond to 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase. A highly pure preparation from rabbit reticulocytes (20.Deshpande K.L. Seubert P.H. Tillman D.M. Farkas W.R. Katze J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) gave peptides with homology to the immunophilin p59, human elongation factor 2 (EF2), and a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP14. It is noteworthy that none of the peptide sequences obtained showed similarity to the eubacterial TGT. The results do suggest, however, that in eukaryotes the TGT activity could be embedded in a multisubunit complex. Most recently, Deshpande and Katze (21.Deshpande K.L. Katze J.R. Gene. 2001; 265: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) identified a cDNA clone encoding a putative TGT catalytic subunit. Cloning the cDNA into a mammalian expression plasmid reconstituted TGT activity in GC3/c1 cells, which are known to be naturally deficient in Q-containing tRNA (22.Gündüz U. Elliott M.S. Seubert P.H. Houghton J.A. Houghton P.J. Trewyn R.W. Katze J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1139: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify for the first time the composition of the eukaryotic tRNA guanine transglycosylase, reconstitute the catalytic activity in vitro, and examine the intracellular distribution of the active subunits. The E. coli TGT was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using the primer pair ETF (5′-gcgcatatgaaatttgaactggacaccacc-3′) and ETR (5′-cacctcgagttaatcaacgttcaaaggtggtattc-3′) and cloned into the pET15b plasmid (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI to generate the ETGT:pET15b plasmid (His tag). The cDNA clones for Qv0 (NM029128; IMAGE: 30105859) and Qv2 (BC017628; IMAGE: 4505816) were purchased from the IMAGE consortium. Primers were designed for the AUG translation start and TGA stop site of Qv0 to search for additional related proteins by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) leading to the discovery of Qv1, below. Full-length mouse TGT (fTGT) and Qv1 were reverse-transcribed from total kidney RNA of 4-week-old male mice using a fTGT-specific reverse primer FTR (5′-cacctcgagtcatgtgagcatgattcccacagag-3′) and a QTRTD1 reverse primer QR (5′-cacctcgagtgcaaacatctgtctgcaaatgagttc-3′; note the stop codon was converted to an Ala; underlined) according to the Superscript III protocol (Invitrogen) for gene-specific primers. First-strand products were separated from reaction components using a nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). TGT and Qv1 were amplified by PCR using the aforementioned reverse primers and the forward primers FTF (5′-gacgaattcatggcggcggtaggcagcccaggttc-3′) and QF (5′-cgacatatgatgaagctgagtctcatcaaagtcg-3′), respectively. The fTGT cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pGEX6P1 (Invitrogen) to give the plasmid fTGT:pGEX6P1 (GST tag), whereas Qv1 was cloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET21a plasmid (Novagen) to produce the plasmid Qv1:pET21a (His tag). A truncated version of the mouse TGT (tTGT) was also produced, missing the coding sequence for the first 16 amino acids. This sequence was amplified from the fTGT:pGEX6P1 plasmid using the primer pair tTF (5′-gaccatatgcggctggtcgctgagtgcagtc-3′) and tTR (5′-cacgtcgactcatgtgagcatgattcccacaag-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the NdeI and SalI restriction sites of the pET15b plasmid to yield tTGT:pET15b (His tag). DNA sequencing of all constructs was performed in the forward and reverse direction. The Qv1 sequence had not been previously described and was therefore deposited in the EMBL nucleotide data base under GenBankTM accession number FM985972. For the generation of mammalian expression constructs, the TGT and Qv1 cDNA were cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen), pcDNA3.1/HA (modified plasmid), pCMV.Myc, and pCMV.HA (Clontech). BL21(DE3) tgt::Kmr cells (whose tgt gene was disrupted by the insertion of a group II intron, supplemental Fig. S1) were transformed with ETGT: pET15b, fTGT:pGEX6P1, tTGT:pET15b, and Qv1:pET21a plasmids and cultured in LB medium. Induction of protein expression was performed with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in 2xYT broth, at 18 °C overnight. His-tagged E. coli TGT, tTGT, and Qv1 proteins were purified by nickel-charged HiTrap chromatography, whereas the GST-tagged fTGT was isolated on a GSTrap FF prepacked column by cleavage of the tag using PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antisera to TGT and Qv1 were raised in New Zealand White rabbits (Harlan, UK) and purified by NAb Protein A spin columns (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antisera were further purified by counterselection against purified TGT and Qv1 protein bound to Ultralink Biosupport resin (Pierce). Coupling of TGT and Qv1 to resin was carried out overnight in 0.1 m MOPS, 0.6 m sodium citrate, pH 7.5, at room temperature. The resin was quenched with 3 m ethanolamine, washed with 1 m NaCl, and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Antisera were eluted with a 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 buffer containing 1 mm NaCl. When required, bulk tRNA was isolated from E. coli according to published protocols (23.Yang W.K. Novelli G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 20: 44-55Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To assess transglycosylase activity, enzyme (2 μg) was added to 150 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 units of SUPERasin (Ambion) RNase inhibitor mixture) containing 0.1 absorbance unit of Baker's yeast tRNA (Roche Applied Science) or E. coli tRNA, and 1.8 μm [8-14C]guanine. The reaction was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before quenching with 450 μl of acid phenol:chloroform, pH 4.5 (Invitrogen) and spun for 3 min at 16,000 × g to separate aqueous and organic layers. The upper (aqueous) phase was loaded onto a 0.5-ml DEAE cellulose (Whatman) spin column and spun at 0.1 × g for 30 s. The flow-through was reloaded on the column another three times. The DEAE was then washed with 2 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl). Bound tRNA was eluted with 1 ml of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 m NaCl). Eluate was mixed with 10 volumes of Ecoscint A (National Diagnostics) and scintillation counted. tRNA labeled with [8-14C]guanine in the wobble position of anticodon loop (tRNA*) was produced as described previously (24.Hoops G.C. Townsend L.B. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15381-15387Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A 150-μl reaction containing 5 absorbance units of tRNA* and 4 μg of enzyme in assay buffer was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Reactions were directly loaded onto a DEAE spin column and spun at 0.1 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. The column was washed with 2 ml of wash buffer. Eluate and wash were combined, added to 10 volumes Ecoscint A, and counted by scintillation. Total RNA was extracted from adult male mice and reverse-transcribed using a QTRTD1 reverse primer QSR (5′-gacgtcatctcttggttgcaaccagttg-3′) capable of amplifying all three splice variants or an 18S ribosomal subunit reverse primer 18SR (5′-tgccttccttggatgtgg-3′) according to the Superscript III protocol for gene-specific primers (Invitrogen). First-strand products were separated from reaction components using a nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). The QTRTD1 splice variants and the 18S subunit were amplified by PCR using the aforementioned reverse primers and the forward primers QSF (5′-ccagctcacactctcatccctagca-3′) and 18SF (5′-cgtctgccctatcaactttc-3′), respectively. Total RNA was size-fractionated, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed using radioactively labeled cDNA for TGT and Qv1 retrieved from the pGEX6P1 and pET21a vectors, respectively. As a loading control, the membrane was stained with methylene blue to visualize the 18S and 28S ribosomal bands. COS-7 monkey kidney cells were from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 units of penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in a ratio of 2 μl to 1 μg of DNA. Total, cytoplasmic, nuclear, membrane, and mitochondrial fractions were isolated using kits (Pierce) as instructed by the manufacturer. Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 in 4-well chamber slides (BD-Falcon). Mitochondrial staining was carried out with 100 nm Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen) for 15 min before fixation with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells transfected with Myc- and HA-tagged plasmids were incubated with 1:500 mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antisera (Clontech) and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antisera (Clontech), respectively. Anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 635 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody were used at 1:1000 dilution. For confocal analysis, antisera raised against TGT and Qv1 were used at 1:500 dilution before being probed with 1:1000 anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole). The coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). Images were taken using the 405-, 488-, and 633-nm laser lines on an Olympus FluoView TM FV1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus). The E. coli TGT protein was chosen as bait sequence in protein BLAST (pblast) and translated nucleotide BLAST (tblastn) searches of the mouse nonredundant and EST data bases. Initial searches identified a mouse TGT (NM021888), transcribed from the queuine tRNA ribosyltransferase (QTRT1) gene on chromosome 9, which is equivalent to the previously identified human TGT catalytic subunit (21.Deshpande K.L. Katze J.R. Gene. 2001; 265: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Further searches, using both the E. coli and mouse TGT proteins as bait, revealed two additional related mouse members of the family (NM029128 and BC017628), and a third was subsequently identified in male mouse kidney (FM985972) by RT-PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). The three latter proteins arise from alternative spliced transcripts of the queuine tRNA ribosyltransferase domain containing 1 (QTRTD1) gene, which is composed of nine exons and is transcribed from the minus strand of chromosome 16 (supplemental Fig. S2). In accordance with standard convention (25.Eppig J.T. Blake J.A. Bult C.J. Kadin J.A. Richardson J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D630-D637Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the three spliced products have been assigned the names QTRTD1 variant_0 (Qv0), which is missing exon 5, QTRTD1 variant_1 (Qv1), which contains all nine exons, and QTRTD1 variant_2 (Qv2), which in addition to containing all nine exons has retained one-third of intron 6, exploiting a later downstream cryptic donor site to engage with exon 7. The three QTRTD1 splice variants were also identifiable within the Alternative Splicing Data Base (ASD, 26.Thanaraj T.A. Stamm S. Clark F. Riethoven J.J. Le Texier V. Muilu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D64-D69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although Qv1 was present only as a 5′ and 3′ partial clone. Interestingly, four clones in the ASD reveal the existence of exonic isoforms for exon 2 because of alternative splice donor events. In all cases, the extension of exon 2 generates a truncated peptide of only 68 amino acids. These are unlikely to be functional and are not considered further. Alignment of the mouse and Z. mobilis TGT protein sequences (Fig. 1) revealed a high degree of amino acid conservation (42% identity), and it is therefore expected that the eukaryotic TGT adopts a similar (β/α)8 fold (13.Xie W. Liu X. Huang R.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is notable from the alignment that the residues involved in catalysis (residue numbering adopted from the Z. mobilis TGT) are highly conserved; the two essential active site aspartates (Asp-102, Asp-280), residues involved in substrate recognition (Ser-103, Asp-156, Gln-203, Gly-230, Leu-231), residues involved in tRNA recognition (Arg-286, Arg-289), and residues responsible for coordinating the zinc ion (Cys-318, Cys-320, Cys-323, and His-349). The three QTRTD1 splice variants Qv0, Qv1, and Qv2 generate protein products of 345, 416, and 271 amino acids, respectively. Aligning the QTRTD1 splice variants with the TGT proteins shows a low overall degree of conservation (Fig. 1). For example, mouse TGT and Qv1 share 23% sequence identity and 41% homology. The potential secondary structure of the QTRTD1 variants was examined using the computer application Porter (27.Pollastri G. McLysaght A. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 1719-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), the results of which are shown below the alignment blocks. Manual adjustments were made to conserve the positioning of the secondary structure elements with respect to the Z. mobilis TGT. It is highly probable given the conserved alternating pattern of secondary elements that the mammalian QTRTD1 variants share a similar (β/α)8 structure to the TGT proteins. Assuming the fidelity of our alignment, the residues known to be important for catalysis in the TGT proteins are not conserved in the N-terminal two-thirds of the QTRTD1 proteins. However, there is a distinct conservation of residues in the C-terminal subdomain involved in zinc binding (Cys-318, Cys-320, Cys-323, and His-349) and a conserved substitution of the active site nucleophile Asp-280 to a glutamic acid residue. A further interesting feature of the alignment is the almost complete conservation of residues in the C terminus of Qv1 and Qv2 with an established role in dimer formation in the Z. mobilis TGT protein (Trp/His-326, Ala-329, Tyr-330, His-333, Leu-334, Glu-339, Leu-341, Leu-345) and a reciprocal presence of dimer-forming residues in the N-terminal β1-α1 region (Ala-49, Thr-50, Lys-52, Leu-74, Pro-78, Phe-92) of mouse TGT (10.Stengl B. Reuter K. Klebe G. Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 1926-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The splicing pattern of the QTRTD1 gene gives rise to significant insertions and deletions. The Qv0 sequence is missing a 71-amino acid segment (Lys-120 to Val-191) relative to Qv1 and Qv2. The purpose of this region is at present unclear. However, it is intriguing that it contains a consensus leucine-rich nuclear export signal (Fig. 1, boxed region, SLLFLDSCLRLQEES), which not only adheres to the accepted form Φ-X2–3-Φ-X2–3-Φ-X-Φ (Φ = L, I, V, F, M; X is any amino acid), but the region is rich in glutamate, aspartate, and serine and occurs at the end of a putative α-helix at the border of secondary structure elements; features typical of a leucine-rich export signal (28.la Cour T. Kiemer L. Mølgaard A. Gupta R. Skriver K. Brunak S. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 29.Kutay U. Güttinger S. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). An insertion of 41 amino acids in Qv0 and Qv1 is seen relative to the TGT proteins (at Asp-297). This occurs within the zinc-binding subdomain and immediately C-terminal to the last helix (α12 in Z. mobilis TGT) of the (β/α)8 motif. Qv2 is notable in that although it has the longest coding sequence its transcript produces the shortest protein because of the presence of an early stop site, consequently leading to a complete loss of the terminal zinc-binding domain. The expression pattern of splice variants is often specific to a particular developmental stage, tissue, or disease state. To determine the expression pattern of the QTRTD1 splice variants in adult mouse, primers were designed to exon 2 and exon 7, which could amplify all three splice variants, yielding amplicons of 551 bp, 757 bp, and 1.6 kb for Qv0, Qv1, and Qv2, respectively (Fig. 2A). It was observed that the Qv1 transcript is present in adult mouse brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis (upper panel). By contrast, no product could be detected for Qv0 or Qv2. Amplification from the 18S ribosomal subunit (125 bp) acted as a loading control (lower panel). We next examined the mRNA expression of TGT and Qv1 in mouse by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2B). The message for both proteins was found to exist in all tissues examined, giving a hybridization band at 1405 bp for TGT (upper panel) and 3125 bp for Qv1 (middle panel), which reasonably correlates with the predicted sizes of 1334 bp and 3031 bp for the TGT and Qv1 cDNA sequences, respectively. In the case of Qv1 a second fainter hybridizing band, migrating above the main species, was observable in all tissues with the exception of testis. Unexpectedly, the blot analysis revealed a correlation between the relative tissue expression levels of the TGT and Qv1 transcripts. These data indicate that the transcription of both proteins may be coordinately regulated, and by extension that the proteins may function in a cooperative manner. A search of eukaryotic species for the expression of TGT and Qv1 demonstrated that both proteins are invariably found together (results not shown), further hinting their cooperative function. The only eukaryotic species found not to contain a Qv1 homologue was the Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Curiously, Baker's yeast is also the only eukaryote from which the TGT gene was absent. The observation that the transcript levels of TGT and Qv1 correlate in mouse tissue and that the proteins are found together in eukaryotes led us to hypothesize that they may account for the heterodimeric tRNA guanine transglycosylase activity observed from protein purification studies. Constructs that add an N- or C-terminal Myc or HA epitope were developed for TGT and Qv1. Initial transient transfection studies showed that the N-terminal tags interfered with either the expression or the stability of the TGT protein and, therefore, could not be used. This was not the case with the Qv1 constructs. To examine the ability of the proteins to self-associate or co-associate, combinations of N- and C-terminally tagged forms of both proteins were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and lysates were immunoprecipitated using HA-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3A). Our results showed that TGT protein, which had been tagged by a Myc epitope (TGT-Myc) or HA epitope (TGT-HA) on the C terminus, is unable to self-associate (left hand upper panel, lane 1). A weak self-association was, however, observed for Qv1 (middle upper panel, lane 1) that had been tagged on the C terminus with a Myc epitope (Qv1-Myc) and on the N terminus with an HA epitope (HA-Qv1). By contrast, an intense signal, indicative of strong interaction, was observed by immunoprecipitation of the TGT-Myc and HA-Qv1 proteins (right hand upper panel, lane 1). Confocal microscopy of TGT-Myc and HA-Qv1 showed similar intracellular localization (Fig. 3B). A conspicuous feature of the confocal image is that the TGT-Myc (upper panel) and HA-Qv1 (middle panel) proteins are absent from the nucleus, as visualized by DAPI stain (lower panel). These data support the possibility that these proteins interact, as suggested earlier by the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. There are no reports describing the successful overexpression of eukaryotic TGT in E. coli. Indeed, it has been stated that the cDNA for the human TGT catalytic subunit is toxic to E. coli (21.Deshpande K.L. Katze J.R. Gene. 2001; 265: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that expression of E. coli TGT in a naturally Q-deficient E. coli stain, B105, results in loss of viability (30.Dineshkumar T.K. Thanedar S. Subbulakshmi C. Varshney U. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3779-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Despite these reservations, we developed a strain of E. coli (BL21 (DE3) tgt::Kmr) that are deficient in Q to overproduce the mouse TGT and Qv1 proteins; thereby negati"
https://openalex.org/W2088870397,"Class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation occur in mature B-cells in response to antigen stimulation. These processes are crucial for the generation of functional antibodies. During HIV-1 infection, loss of memory B-cells, together with an altered differentiation of naïve B-cells result in production of low quality antibodies, which may be due to impaired immunoglobulin affinity maturation. In the current study, we evaluated the effect of HIV-1 infection on class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation by studying the expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in peripheral B-cells from a cohort of chronically HIV-1 infected patients as compared to a group of healthy controls. In parallel, we also characterized the phenotype of B-cells and their ability to produce immunoglobulins in vitro. Cells from HIV-1 infected patients showed higher baseline levels of AID expression and increased IgA production measured ex-vivo and upon CD40 and TLR9 stimulation in vitro. Moreover, the percentage of CD27(-)IgA+ and CD27(-)IgG+ B-cells in blood was significantly increased in HIV-1 infected patients as compared to controls. Interestingly, our results showed a significantly increased number of somatic hypermutations in the VH genes in CD27(-) cells from patients. Taken together, these results show that during HIV-1 infection, CD27(-) B-cells can also produce class switched and somatically hypermutated antibodies. Our data add important information for the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the loss of specific antibody production observed during HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2050207287,"The Na+,K+-ATPase C terminus has a unique location between transmembrane segments, appearing to participate in a network of interactions. We have examined the functional consequences of amino acid substitutions in this region and deletions of the C terminus of varying lengths. Assays revealing separately the mutational effects on internally and externally facing Na+ sites, as well as E1-E2 conformational changes, have been applied. The results pinpoint the two terminal tyrosines, Tyr1017 and Tyr1018, as well as putative interaction partners, Arg935 in the loop between transmembrane segments M8 and M9 and Lys768 in transmembrane segment M5, as crucial to Na+ activation of phosphorylation of E1, a partial reaction reflecting Na+ interaction on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Tyr1017, Tyr1018, and Arg935 are furthermore indispensable to Na+ interaction on the extracellular side of the membrane, as revealed by inability of high Na+ concentrations to drive the transition from E1P to E2P backwards toward E1P and inhibit Na+-ATPase activity in mutants. Lys768 is not important for Na+ binding from the external side of the membrane but is involved in stabilization of the E2 form. These data demonstrate that the C terminus controls Na+ affinity on both sides of the membrane and suggest that Arg935 constitutes an important link between the C terminus and the third Na+ site, involving an arginine-π stacking interaction between Arg935 and the C-terminal tyrosines. Lys768 may interact preferentially with the C terminus in E1 and E1P forms and with the loop between transmembrane segments M6 and M7 in E2 and E2P forms.

The Na+,K+-ATPase is a membrane-bound ion pump that uses energy liberated by hydrolysis of ATP to exchange intracellular Na+ for extracellular K+ at a ratio of 3:2, thus creating the gradients for Na+ and K+ across the cell membrane required for electrical excitability, cellular uptake of ions, nutrients, and neurotransmitters, and regulation of cell volume and intracellular pH (1.Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. 1993; 462: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2.Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Like other P-type ATPases, such as the Ca2+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase, the Na+,K+-ATPase forms a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate through transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to a conserved aspartate residue in the P-domain. It is generally believed that the transport mechanism is consecutive, the Na+ ions being translocated before K+. The binding of three Na+ ions from the cytoplasmic side to the E1 form triggers phosphorylation of the enzyme by ATP, and binding of two K+ ions from the extracellular side to E2P activates the dephosphorylation (“Post-Albers model,” Scheme 1) (3.Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During transfer across the membrane, the Na+ and K+ ions become occluded in the binding pocket, being temporarily unable to dissociate to either side of the membrane. The three Na+ ions are released sequentially to the external side in connection with the E1P → E2P conformational transition, and K+ dissociates to the cytoplasmic side in association with the E2 → E1 transition of the dephosphoenzyme (Scheme 1). Recently, the structure of the Na+,K+-ATPase in the E2 form with two occluded Rb+ ions bound as K+ congeners was determined by x-ray crystallography at 3.5 Å resolution (4.Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sørensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The α-subunit consists of 10 membrane-spanning helices, αM1–αM10, 2The abbreviations used are: αM1–αM10 or M1–M10the 10 transmembrane segments of the α-subunit numbered from the N terminusβMthe transmembrane segment of the β-subunit.2The abbreviations used are: αM1–αM10 or M1–M10the 10 transmembrane segments of the α-subunit numbered from the N terminusβMthe transmembrane segment of the β-subunit. and three distinct cytoplasmic domains denoted A (actuator), N (nucleotide binding), and P (phosphorylation) by analogy to the closely related sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) (5.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). The K+ binding pocket is located between transmembrane helices αM4, αM5, αM6, and αM8. The K+ binding sites are comprised of residues homologous to those binding the two Ca2+ ions in the E1 form of the Ca2+-ATPase, and it is therefore likely that they also make up two of the three Na+ binding sites in the Na+,K+-ATPase E1 form. The location of the third Na+ site that has no counterpart in the Ca2+-ATPase remains elusive (4.Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sørensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The Na+,K+-ATPase also consists of, in addition to the α-subunit, a β-subunit with a large extracellular domain and a single membrane span (βM). The β-subunit is required for routing the α-subunit to the plasma membrane and is furthermore essential for K+ binding (6.Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6737-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), possibly because it influences the positioning of some of the transmembrane segments of the α-subunit in E2 conformation. In many cell types, the αβ-complex interacts with a small regulatory transmembrane protein belonging to the FXYD family (7.Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2006; 290: F241-F250Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Because the Na+ concentration in a normal cell is rather low (typically around 10–15 mm), the Na+,K+-ATPase operates at only a fraction of its maximal pumping rate. Hence, changes in the cytoplasmic Na+ concentration or in the affinity for Na+ constitute important regulatory measures, and the Na+ affinity is differentially affected by the various FXYD proteins. the 10 transmembrane segments of the α-subunit numbered from the N terminus the transmembrane segment of the β-subunit. the 10 transmembrane segments of the α-subunit numbered from the N terminus the transmembrane segment of the β-subunit. The crystal structure of the Na+,K+-ATPase (4.Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sørensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) revealed an unexpected location of the C terminus of the α-subunit between the transmembrane helices (see Fig. 1A). The C terminus consists of a PGG motif followed by an extension of eight residues relative to the corresponding C terminus of the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a isoform). The first part of this extension forms a small helix between the transmembrane helices βM, αM7, and αM10, and the two C-terminal tyrosine residues are accommodated in a binding pocket between αM7, αM8, and αM5 (see Fig. 1, B–D). This unique position prompted us to examine the functional role of the C terminus by deletion of the five most C-terminal residues KETYY, which reduced the Na+ affinity of the E1 form conspicuously, thus indicating a previously unrecognized importance of the C terminus for Na+ binding at one or more of the three cytoplasmically facing activating sites (4.Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sørensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The putative role of the C terminus in regulation of Na+ affinity led us to denote it “switch region.” It was, however, not clear, whether the position of the C-terminal carboxylate group, the interaction of the side chains, or both are crucial for Na+ binding. The C terminus and its binding pocket are well resolved in the crystal structure, as indicated by the electron density map contoured at 1σ in Fig. 1, A and B, thus providing information of considerable detail and confidence. Hence, a possible involvement of the C-terminal carboxylate group as well as the hydroxyl groups of the two C-terminal tyrosines in hydrogen/salt bridge formation is suggested (see Fig. 1, B–D). The terminal tyrosine residue, 3All numbering of Na+,K+-ATPase residues in this article refers to the sequence of the rat α1-isoform.3All numbering of Na+,K+-ATPase residues in this article refers to the sequence of the rat α1-isoform. Tyr1018, seems to be in position to make bonds with Lys768 in M5 and Arg935 in the loop connecting M8 and M9, and Tyr1017 may also interact with Arg935 (Fig. 1, B–D). It is unknown whether these bonds suggested by the crystal structure of the E2 form with bound Rb+ exist in the Na+-bound E1 form and, if so, whether they could mediate the observed effects of the C terminus on Na+ affinity. An important question is furthermore whether the C terminus is of any importance in relation to the Na+ sites in the externally facing configuration in the phosphoenzyme. To understand in detail the importance of the structural features of the C terminus, we have in this study examined the functional consequences of replacing individual amino acids in this region and introducing deletions of the C terminus of variable length. The interaction with Na+ in the dephosphoenzyme as well as in the phosphoenzyme was studied, thus revealing separately the mutational effects on internally and externally exposed Na+ sites. Mutations were introduced into full-length cDNA encoding the rat kidney Na+,K+-ATPase (α1-isoform) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutants and wild type were expressed in COS-1 cells, using 5 μm ouabain in the growth medium to inhibit the endogenous COS-1 cell enzyme and thereby select stable transfectants (8.Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9.Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the desired mutations was verified by sequencing the cDNA before transfection into the COS-1 cells, and in most cases, also by sequencing the DNA stably integrated into the genome of the isolated ouabain-resistant COS-1 cell lines. The crude plasma membrane fraction containing expressed wild-type or mutant Na+,K+-ATPase was isolated by differential centrifugation, and prior to functional analysis, the plasma membranes were made leaky with alamethicin or deoxycholate (8.Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Hence, it can be assumed that the membrane potential was zero during the measurements. Measurements of the ATPase activity by following the release of Pi at 37 °C and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation studies using [γ-32P]ATP were carried out as described previously (8.Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10.Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11.Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 18539-18548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); the media compositions are detailed in the figure legends. The acid-precipitated 32P-labeled phosphoenzyme was washed by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 6.0 (10.Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity associated with the separated Na+,K+-ATPase band was quantified by “imaging” using a Packard CycloneTM storage phosphor system. The active site concentration was determined by phosphorylation at 0 °C in the presence of 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 3 mm Mg2+, 150 mm Na+, and oligomycin (20 μg/ml) to block dephosphorylation and thereby obtain stoichiometric phosphorylation (10.Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The catalytic turnover rate was calculated as the ratio between the rate of ATP hydrolysis and the active site concentration. The contribution from endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase in the functional assays was eliminated by including ouabain in the reaction media at a concentration sufficient to inhibit the endogenous enzyme but too low to affect the rat Na+,K+-ATPase. Each data point shown is the average value corresponding to at least three independent measurements. Data normalization, averaging, and non-linear regression analysis were carried out as described previously (10.Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11.Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the results are reported ± S.E. Seventeen new mutations to residues in the C-terminal region of the α-subunit were studied (Table 1). These mutations encompass C-terminal deletions of varying lengths ranging from one or both of the two terminal tyrosines to an eight-residue deletion including the complete C-terminal helix (WVEKE). The EKE part of the helix was also examined in a triple mutation replacing these three charged residues by alanines. The residues in the preceding loop, Pro1008, Gly1009, and Gly1010, were likewise examined by alanine substitutions. The two C-terminal tyrosines were examined by single and double replacements with alanine removing the aromatic function, and to study the importance of the phenolic hydroxyl groups, each of the tyrosines was replaced with phenylalanine. The functional importance of the putative interactions of Arg935 with the C terminus (Fig. 1) was examined by substitution of Arg935 with alanine, and the juxtaposed Arg936 was likewise studied by replacement with alanine. The M5 residue Lys768 within interaction distance of the C terminus was replaced with both alanine and methionine, the latter to remove the positive charge but retain the bulk of the side chain.TABLE 1Ligand concentration dependence and relative amount of E2PK0.5(K+)aData are from Fig. 2 or were obtained from similar experiments with the remaining mutants.K0.5(Na+)bData are from Fig. 3 or were obtained from similar experiments with the remaining mutants.E2PcThese values represent the amplitude of the slow phase corresponding to the fitted curves in Fig. 5; the Na+ concentration is 150 mm.K0.5(ATP)dData are from Fig. 8 or were obtained from similar experiments with the remaining mutants.K0.5(vanadate)eData are from Fig. 9 or were obtained from similar experiments with the remaining mutants.K0.5(ouabain)fThese values represent the K0.5 value for inhibition of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity by ouabain.

Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), and the K0.5 values for Na+, ATP, and vanadate are the same as reported in Ref. (4.Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P.

Open table in a new tab The mutations were introduced into the cDNA encoding the ouabain-resistant rat α1-isoform of the Na+,K+-ATPase, and the wild-type and mutant rat enzymes were expressed using the mammalian COS-1 cell system under ouabain-selective pressure (8.Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9.Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the mutants were capable of sustaining cell growth in the presence of ouabain at a concentration inhibiting the endogenous COS-1 cell Na+,K+-ATPase, indicating that the Na+ and K+ transport rates of the mutants are sufficiently high to be compatible with cell viability. The catalytic turnover rate (Na+,K+-ATPase activity per active site) measured at 130 mm Na+, 20 mm K+, and 3 mm ATP on the isolated membranes containing the expressed exogenous enzyme was markedly reduced for mutant K768A (2896 ± 179 min−1 (n = 8), compare with wild type 8474 ± 165 min−1 (n = 11)). A slight reduction relative to wild type was found for mutants R935A (6278 ± 311 min−1 (n = 8)) and ΔWVEKETYY (6556 ± 125 min−1 (n = 6)). For the remaining mutants there was no significant reduction of the catalytic turnover rate measured under these conditions (e.g. ΔYY 8059 ± 339 min−1 (n = 8) and YY-AA 9193 ± 614 min−1 (n = 8)). (See Table 1 for definitions of the multiple substitutions used in this study.) Fig. 2 shows the K+ concentration dependence of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity at a relatively low Na+ concentration of 40 mm. K+ present at submillimolar concentrations activates ATP hydrolysis due to the stimulation of dephosphorylation by K+ binding at the external sites on E2P (cf. Scheme 1). All the mutants showed wild type-like (less than 2-fold deviation from wild type) apparent affinity for K+ activation (Fig. 2 and Table 1). However, several of the mutants also displayed, in addition to the K+ activation phase, an inhibition phase at high K+ concentrations. This inhibition was particularly manifest (>20% inhibition) for the C-terminal deletion mutants ΔYY, ΔTYY, and ΔWVEKETYY as well as for YY-AA, R935A, and K768A. A less pronounced inhibition was seen for Y1017A, Y1018A, and K768M, whereas there was no inhibition of the wild type, ΔY, Y1017F, Y1018F, T1016A, R936A, P1008A, GG-AA, and EKE-AAA (Fig. 2). As demonstrated by Skou (13.Skou J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 23: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) in his pioneering first study on the Na+,K+ pump, such an inhibition phase can also be detected for the wild-type enzyme if the Na+ concentration is lowered. This inhibition is caused by K+ binding in competition with Na+ at the cytoplasmically facing E1 sites. The inhibition seen here for some of the mutants may therefore be caused by an increased ability of K+ to compete with Na+ at the E1 sites. To determine the Na+ affinity at the cytoplasmically facing sites of the E1 form, the Na+ dependence of phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP was studied in the absence of K+, and in the presence of oligomycin added to stabilize the Na+-occluded form as much as possible (Fig. 3). A 32-fold reduction of the Na+ affinity relative to wild type was seen for YY-AA, and dramatic reductions were also found for the C-terminal deletion mutants ΔYY, ΔTYY, and ΔWVEKETYY (9-, 17-, and 25-fold, respectively, Fig. 3 and Table 1). The previously studied ΔKETYY mutant (4.Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sørensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), giving a 26-fold reduction of Na+ affinity for phosphorylation, fits nicely into this picture (data not shown here, but see summary in Table 1). It is noteworthy that the double substitution of the two terminal tyrosines with alanines, YY-AA, reduced the Na+ affinity significantly more than deletion of the two tyrosines. A 5-fold reduction of Na+ affinity was seen upon single alanine substitution of the most C-terminal tyrosine, Y1018A, whereas 2.7- and 2.3-fold reductions were seen for alanine substitution of the preceding tyrosine, Y1017A, and deletion of a single tyrosine, ΔY, respectively. Removal of the side chain hydroxyl group from each of the tyrosines by replacement with phenylalanine did not affect Na+ affinity significantly (mutants Y1017F and Y1018F), and the same was the case for the mutations T1016A, R936A, P1008A, GG-AA, and EKE-AAA, whereas R935A reduced Na+ affinity 5-fold. A 5-fold reduction was also seen for K768A, and a smaller, 3.3-fold reduction was seen for K768M (Fig. 3 and Table 1). These results correlate very well with the inhibitory effects of high K+ concentrations seen in Fig. 2, the mutants with the most pronounced inhibition by K+ also showing the largest reduction of Na+ affinity, thus indicating that the enhanced ability of K+ to compete with Na+ in the E1 form is caused by a weaker Na+ binding at one or more of the E1 sites. Because oligomycin stabilizes the Na+-occluded state (14.Esmann M. Skou J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15.Skou J.C. Kaplan J.H. De Weer P. The Sodium Pump: Recent Developments. The Rockefeller University Press, New York1991: 317-319Google Scholar), thereby promoting phosphorylation and reducing dephosphorylation by blocking the E1P → E2P transition, the phosphoenzyme builds up to a maximal level in the presence of oligomycin. Fig. 4 shows the amount of phosphoenzyme accumulated in the absence of oligomycin, relative to the maximal phosphorylation level observed in the presence of oligomycin as stabilizer (EP/EPmax ratio), at two Na+ concentrations of 150 and 600 mm. For the wild type, the EP/EPmax ratio was 85 and 69% at 150 and 600 mm Na+, respectively, and for most mutants, EP/EPmax was wild type-like at 150 mm Na+. Only K768A showed a marked reduction of EP/EPmax to 37% under these conditions. At 600 mm Na+, the mutants ΔYY, ΔTYY, ΔWVEKETYY, YY-AA, R935A, K768A, and K768M all showed a conspicuous reduction of EP/EPmax to 20% or less. For comparison, we included the previously described ΔKETYY mutant (4.Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sørensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), and this mutant showed a reduction of the EP/EPmax ratio to the same low level at 600 mm Na+ (Fig. 4). The low EP/EPmax ratios may be the result of either a reduced phosphorylation rate or an increased dephosphorylation rate (see further under “Discussion”). The two phosphoenzyme intermediates, E1P and E2P, are distinguished by difference in reactivity with ADP. The E1P intermediate, which has three Na+ ions bound in an occluded state, is ADP-sensitive, i.e. able to react with ADP and donate the phosphoryl group back to ADP, forming ATP. By contrast, E2P is ADP-insensitive but dephosphorylates by hydrolysis of the aspartyl phosphoryl bond. The latter reaction is activated by K+, binding with high affinity at two extracellularly facing sites on E2P (Scheme 1), and to some extent by Na+, presumably binding at the same sites as K+ but with low affinity (3.Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon the addition of ADP to the phosphoenzyme formed from [γ-32P]ATP, two decay phases can be distinguished, a rapid phase corresponding to E1P reacting backward with ADP and a slow phase corresponding to decay of E2P (10.Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11.Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B.

Fig. 5 shows the results of such ADP dephosphorylation experiments carried out with selected mutants following phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of oligomycin (to allow subsequent dephosphorylation) and in the presence of 150 mm Na+ (to obtain a sufficiently high phosphorylation level for the dephosphorylation rate to be accurately determined, cf. Fig. 4). The relative amounts of the rapidly and slowly dephosphorylating components were determined by fitting a biexponential function, and the amplitude of the slow phase (E2P) is indicated in Table 1. The mutants ΔYY, ΔTYY, ΔKETYY, ΔWVEKETYY, YY-AA, and R935A, displaying a large reduction in affinity for cytoplasmic Na+ (Fig. 3), also exhibited a higher E2P level (68–85%) than wild type (57%). Mutant K768A exhibited a lower E2P level (45%) than the wild type, i.e. an increased amount of ADP-sensitive E1P, and mutants EKE-AAA and GG-AA were wild type-like. Experiments measuring Na+ flux and ADP-ATP exchange using sided Na+,K+-ATPase membrane preparations have established that Na+ binds to intracellular activating sites as well as to extracellular inhibitory and activating sites (16.Garrahan P.J.

We sequenced the gag, env, and pol genes of seroconverters' HIV strains to identify genetically-related HIV transmission clusters and antiretroviral resistance. We combined risk, genetic, and administrative data to describe prison HIV transmission networks. Results Forty-one (47%) seroconverters were diagnosed with HIV from July 2003–June 2005 when voluntary annual testing was offered. Seroconverters were less likely to report sex (OR [odds ratio] = 0.02, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 0–0.10) and tattooing (OR = 0.03, 95% CI: <0.01–0.20) in prison after their HIV diagnosis than before. Of 67 seroconverters' specimens tested, 33 (49%) fell into one of 10 genetically-related clusters; of these, 25 (76%) reported sex in prison before their HIV diagnosis. The HIV strains of 8 (61%) of 13 antiretroviral-naïve and 21 (40%) of 52 antiretroviral-treated seroconverters were antiretroviral-resistant. Discussion Half of all HIV seroconversions were identified when routine voluntary testing was offered, and seroconverters reduced their risks following their diagnosis. Most genetically-related seroconverters reported sex in prison, suggesting HIV transmission through sexual networks. Resistance testing before initiating antiretroviral therapy is important for newly-diagnosed inmates."
https://openalex.org/W2106384658,"The human hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) gene encodes for an enzyme making hyaluronan, altered concentrations of which are associated with many pathological situations including wounding, several inflammatory conditions, and malignant tumors. In this study we showed that HAS2 is a primary target of the cAMP activator forskolin and the nuclear hormone all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). The first 2250 bp of the promoter contain three response elements (REs) for the transcription factor CREB1 as well as two REs for the nuclear receptor RAR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and re-chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using selected fragments of the promoter containing the putative REs showed that forskolin and all-trans-RA modulate the formation of complexes between CREB1 and RAR with various co-regulators at the predicted sites. Interestingly, CREB1 complexes are regulated by all-trans-RA as are RAR complexes by forskolin. Reporter gene assays using nested promoter fragments supported these findings. Forskolin and all-trans-RA co-stimulation reduced the binding of CREB1, RAR, and the co-repressor nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCoR1), but enhanced the association of co-activators MED1 and CREB-binding protein (CBP). RNA interference experiments suggested that MED1 and NCoR1 are central for the all-trans-RA induction of the HAS2 gene and CBP dominates its forskolin response. In general, our findings suggest a convergence of CREB1 and RAR signaling, and demonstrate the individual character of each RE in terms of co-regulator use."
https://openalex.org/W2085633321,"Although PTIP is implicated in the DNA damage response, through interactions with 53BP1, the function of PTIP in the DNA damage response remain elusive. Here, we show that RNF8 controls DNA damage-induced nuclear foci formation of PTIP, which in turn regulates 53BP1 localization to the DNA damage sites. In addition, SMC1, a substrate of ATM, could not be phosphorylated at the DNA damage sites in the absence of PTIP. The PTIP-dependent pathway is important for DNA double strand breaks repair and DNA damage-induced intra-S phase checkpoint activation. Taken together, these results suggest that the role of PTIP in the DNA damage response is downstream of RNF8 and upstream of 53BP1. Thus, PTIP regulates 53BP1-dependent signaling pathway following DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1975546816,"Quinine is a major drug of choice for the treatment of malaria. However, the primary mode of quinine action is unclear, and its efficacy is marred by adverse reactions among patients. To help address these issues, a genome-wide screen for quinine sensitivity was carried out using the yeast deletion strain collection. Quinine-sensitive mutants identified in the screen included several that were defective for tryptophan biosynthesis (<i>trp</i> strains). This sensitivity was confirmed in independent assays and was suppressible with exogenous Trp, suggesting that quinine caused Trp starvation. Accordingly, quinine was found to inhibit [<sup>3</sup>H]Trp uptake by cells, and the quinine sensitivity of a <i>trp1</i>Δ mutant could be rescued by overexpression of Trp permeases, encoded by <i>TAT1</i> and <i>TAT2</i>. The site of quinine action was identified specifically as the high affinity Trp/Tyr permease, Tat2p, with which quinine associated in a Trp-suppressible manner. A resultant action also on Tyr levels was reflected by the Tyr-suppressible quinine hypersensitivity of an <i>aro7</i>Δ deletion strain, which is auxotrophic for Tyr (and Phe). The present genome-wide dataset provides an important resource for discovering modes of quinine toxicity. That potential was validated with our demonstration that Trp and Tyr uptake via Tat2p is a major target of cellular quinine toxicity. The results also suggest that dietary tryptophan supplements could help to avert the toxic effects of quinine."
https://openalex.org/W1991076345,"Background The concept of ribosomal constraints on rRNA genes is deduced primarily based on the comparison of consensus rRNA sequences between closely related species, but recent advances in whole-genome sequencing allow evaluation of this concept within organisms with multiple rRNA operons. Methodology/Principal Findings Using the 23S rRNA gene as an example, we analyzed the diversity among individual rRNA genes within a genome. Of 184 prokaryotic species containing multiple 23S rRNA genes, diversity was observed in 113 (61.4%) genomes (mean 0.40%, range 0.01%–4.04%). Significant (1.17%–4.04%) intragenomic variation was found in 8 species. In 5 of the 8 species, the diversity in the primary structure had only minimal effect on the secondary structure (stem versus loop transition). In the remaining 3 species, the diversity significantly altered local secondary structure, but the alteration appears minimized through complex rearrangement. Intervening sequences (IVS), ranging between 9 and 1471 nt in size, were found in 7 species. IVS in Deinococcus radiodurans and Nostoc sp. encode transposases. T. tengcongensis was the only species in which intragenomic diversity >3% was observed among 4 paralogous 23S rRNA genes. Conclusions/Significance These findings indicate tight ribosomal constraints on individual 23S rRNA genes within a genome. Although classification using primary 23S rRNA sequences could be erroneous, significant diversity among paralogous 23S rRNA genes was observed only once in the 184 species analyzed, indicating little overall impact on the mainstream of 23S rRNA gene-based prokaryotic taxonomy."
https://openalex.org/W1971700338,"The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of signaling molecules and their antagonists are involved in patterning of the body axis and numerous aspects of organogenesis. Classical biochemical purification and protein sequencing of highly purified fractions containing potent bone forming activity from bovine cartilage identified several BMPs together with a number of other proteins. One such protein was SMOC-2 (secreted modular calcium-binding protein-2), classified as belonging to the BM-40 family of modular extracellular proteins. Data regarding the biological function of SMOC-2 and closely related SMOC-1 remain limited, and their expression or function during embryological development is unknown. We therefore isolated the Xenopus ortholog of human SMOC-1 (XSMOC-1) and explored its function in Xenopus embryos. In gain-of-function assays, XSMOC-1 acted similarly to a BMP antagonist. However, in contrast to known extracellular ligand-binding BMP antagonists, such as noggin, SMOC antagonizes BMP activity in the presence of a constitutively active BMP receptor, indicating a mechanism of action downstream of the receptor. We provide several lines of evidence to suggest that SMOC acts downstream of the BMP receptor via MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of the Smad linker region. Loss-of-function studies, using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, revealed XSMOC-1 to be essential for postgastrulation development. The catastrophic developmental failure observed following XSMOC knockdown resembles that observed following simultaneous depletion of three ligand-binding BMP antagonists described in prior studies. These findings provide a direct link between the extracellular matrix-associated protein SMOC and a signaling pathway of general importance in anatomic patterning and cell or tissue fate specification."
https://openalex.org/W2055407735,"Background Reoxygenation of ischemic tissues is a major factor that determines the severity of cardiovascular diseases. This paper describes the consequences of anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) stresses on Drosophila, a useful, anoxia tolerant, model organism. Methodology/Principal Findings Newly emerged adult male flies were exposed to anoxic conditions (<1% O2) for 1 to 6 hours, reoxygenated and their survival was monitored. Results A/R stresses induced a transient increase in mortality which peaked at the time of reoxygenation. Then flies recovered low mortality rates similar to those of control flies. A/R induced mortality was strongly dependent on dietary conditions during the 48 h that preceded anoxia. Well fed flies were anoxia sensitive. Strong dietary restrictions and starvation conditions protected flies against A/R injuries. The tolerance to anoxia was associated to large decreases in glycogen, protein, and ATP contents. During anoxia, anoxia tolerant flies produced more lactate, less phosphate and they maintained more stable ATP levels than anoxia sensitive flies. Moderate dietary restrictions, which increased the longevity of normoxic flies, did not promote resistance to A/R stresses. Diet dependent A/R injuries were still observed in sima loss of function mutants and they were insensitive to dietary rapamycin or resveratrol. AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribosefuranoside), an activator AMP kinase decreased A/R injuries. Mutants in the insulin signalling pathway were more anoxia tolerant in a fed state. Conclusion/Significance Long A/R stresses induce a transient increase in mortality in Drosophila. This mortality is highly dependent on dietary conditions prior to the stress. Strong dietary restrictions and starvation conditions protect flies against A/R injuries, probably by inducing a major remodelling of energy metabolism. The results also indicate that mechanistically different responses develop in response to dietary restrictions of different strengths. AMP kinase and the insulin signalling pathway are possible mediators of diet dependent anoxic tolerance in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1972250756,"Alternative splicing yields functionally distinctive gene products, and their balance plays critical roles in cell differentiation and development. We have previously shown that tumor-associated enhancer loss in coactivator gene CoAA leads to its altered alternative splicing. Here we identified two intergenic splicing variants, a zinc finger-containing coactivator CoAZ and a non-coding transcript ncCoAZ, between CoAA and its downstream corepressor gene RBM4. During stem/progenitor cell neural differentiation, we found that the switched alternative splicing and trans-splicing between CoAA and RBM4 transcripts result in lineage-specific expression of wild type CoAA, RBM4, and their variants. Stable expression of CoAA, RBM4, or their variants prevents the switch and disrupts the embryoid body formation. In addition, CoAA and RBM4 counter-regulate the target gene Tau at exon 10, and their splicing activities are subjected to the control by each splice variant. Further phylogenetic analysis showed that mammalian CoAA and RBM4 genes share common ancestry with the Drosophila melanogaster gene Lark, which is known to regulate early development and circadian rhythms. Thus, the trans-splicing between CoAA and RBM4 transcripts may represent a required regulation preserved during evolution. Our results demonstrate that a linked splicing control of transcriptional coactivator and corepressor is involved in stem/progenitor cell differentiation. The alternative splicing imbalance of CoAA and RBM4, because of loss of their common enhancer in cancer, may deregulate stem/progenitor cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2065695541,"In describing and understanding how the HIV epidemic spreads in African countries, previous studies have not taken into account the detailed periods at risk. This study is based on a micro-simulation model (individual-based) of the spread of the HIV epidemic in the population of Zambia, where women tend to marry early and where divorces are not frequent. The main target of the model was to fit the HIV seroprevalence profiles by age and sex observed at the Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2001.A two-sex micro-simulation model of HIV transmission was developed. Particular attention was paid to precise age-specific estimates of exposure to risk through the modelling of the formation and dissolution of relationships: marriage (stable union), casual partnership, and commercial sex. HIV transmission was exclusively heterosexual for adults or vertical (mother-to-child) for children. Three stages of HIV infection were taken into account. All parameters were derived from empirical population-based data. Results show that basic parameters could not explain the dynamics of the HIV epidemic in Zambia. In order to fit the age and sex patterns, several assumptions were made: differential susceptibility of young women to HIV infection, differential susceptibility or larger number of encounters for male clients of commercial sex workers, and higher transmission rate. The model allowed to quantify the role of each type of relationship in HIV transmission, the proportion of infections occurring at each stage of disease progression, and the net reproduction rate of the epidemic (R(0) = 1.95).The simulation model reproduced the dynamics of the HIV epidemic in Zambia, and fitted the age and sex pattern of HIV seroprevalence in 2001. The same model could be used to measure the effect of changing behaviour in the future."

The ability of eIF4E to bind m7G cap structures is thought to enable eIF4F to associate directly with the m7G cap of mRNAs. Yet the presence of RNA binding regions on eIF4G and eIF4A suggests that contacts to RNA may also play a role in mRNA recognition by eIF4F. It is not known which contributions to the stability of eIF4F-mRNA complexes come from binding to the m7G cap and which contributions arise from binding to RNA, and it is thus unclear to what extent eIF4F can discriminate between capped and uncapped RNAs. To delineate contributions from RNA versus those from the m7G cap to the binding by eIF4F, we analyzed binding of eIF4F to RNA in isolation from other processes of translation initiation. By measuring equilibrium binding of rabbit eIF4F to a diverse series of capped and uncapped RNAs, we found no significant effect of the cap on the stability of eIF4F-RNA complexes, even though the m7G cap was verified to be essential for efficient translation initiation. We discovered, however, that eIF4F preferentially and cooperatively bound RNAs with more than ∼60 nucleotides (nt) in vitro. Consistent with this observation, only RNAs exceeding this length, but not shorter ones, strongly inhibited translation activity in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). This inhibition was also cap-independent. Collectively, these observations show that intrinsic RNA binding by eIF4F depends on RNA length, not on m7G cap recognition, and these binding characteristics are recapitulated in RRL. The essential m7G cap may thus either function at steps subsequent to eIF4F-RNA binding, or other factors facilitate a preferential binding of eIF4F to the m7G cap. eIF4F and all other proteins used in this study were purified from RRL and quantified as described previously (11Grifo J.A.

The other RNAs were transcribed from linearized plasmids (β-globin RNA, pBG DNA digested with EcoRI; 158 RNA, pPET22B+ DNA digested with XhoI; and TRAP RNA, pB222 DNA digested with KpnI) by T7 MegaScript transcription kits from Ambion; m7G capped, unlabeled RNAs were produced by including either m7GpppG or anti-reverse cap analog in the transcription mix as directed by the manufacturer (Ambion, T7 mMessage mMachine kit). Capping efficiency approached completion, as verified by gel electrophoresis and UV shadowing. 5′-32P-Labeled uncapped RNAs were generated by treatment of transcripts with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) and subsequent labeling with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Capped labeled RNAs were generated using guanylyltransferase (Ambion) and [α-32P]GTP according to the manufacturer's protocol. All RNAs were purified and recovered from 7 m urea, 6–8% polyacrylamide gels prior to use. RNA concentrations were determined by UV absorbance. To generate capped and uncapped 37-nt fragments of β-globin RNA, a DNAzyme was used to cleave a longer β-globin transcript (17Pyle A.M. Chu V.T. Jankowsky E. Boudvillain M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 140-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 6.75-fold excess of DNAzyme over RNA was incubated in 75 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 3 min at 95 °C, quickly cooled on ice for 5 min, briefly centrifuged, and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Cleavage reactions were started by adjusting the reaction buffer to 150 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 60 mm MgCl2. After incubation at 42 °C for 3 h, the DNAzyme was degraded with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science), and the RNA was recovered and quantified as described above. eIF4F-RNA binding was measured at the eIF4F concentrations indicated at 37 °C in a reaction volume of 10 μl with buffer containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8% (v/v) glycerol, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 (v/v). RNA concentrations were 1 nm. Different RNA concentrations did not change the results. Reactions were incubated for 6 min. Incubation times between 2 and 10 min did not alter results, indicating that equilibrium was reached during the reaction time. Samples were applied to polyacrylamide gels consisting of 3.6% polyacrylamide, 50:1 bis/acrylamide, 0.5× TBE, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol (1-cm wells, 1.5 mm thick). A running buffer containing 0.5× TBE, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol was used, and gels were electrophoresed at 5 watts and 4 °C. The extent of eIF4F-RNA binding was quantified with a Storm PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The fraction of RNA bound to eIF4F (Frac[bound]) was calculated from the intensity of the bound (I[bound]) and of the free (I[free]) RNA species according to Equation 1, Frac[bound]=/[bound]/(/[bound]+/[free])(eq. 1) Apparent binding constants K½,app were determined by plotting Frac[bound] versus concentrations of eIF4F (Fig. 1) using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). The resulting curves were fit to the nonlinear form of the Hill equation, Equation 2, Frac[bound]=[elF4F]n⋅Frac[bound]/([elF4F]n+Kn)(eq. 2) where [eIF4F] is the concentration of eIF4F; n is the Hill constant; Frac[bound]max is the fraction bound at eIF4F saturation; and K½,app is the average apparent dissociation constant for all bound eIF4F molecules (18Kaye N.M.

Subsequently, the PVDF was quickly blotted with Whatman paper to remove excess acrylamide and washed twice in PBS (136 mm NaCl, 27 mm KCl, 43 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mm KH2PO4) for 5 min. Nonspecific antibody adsorption was suppressed with 10 ml of 10% (w/v) nonfat milk dissolved in PBST (PBS plus 0.1% Tween) for 2 h at 25 °C with constant agitation. The PVDF was then washed twice in PBST (5 min, 25 °C) and once in PBS (5 min, 25 °C) and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with 10 ml of primary antibody eIF4E-FL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:100 in PBS and 5% nonfat milk. The PVDF was then washed twice in PBST (5 min at 25 °C) and once in PBS (5 min, 25 °C), incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with 10 ml of the secondary antibody anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) diluted 1:1000 in PBS and 5% nonfat milk, and then washed three times with PBST (5 min, 25 °C). Last, 1.5 ml of West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions and evenly applied to the PVDF paper. After a 1 min incubation at 25 °C, the PVDF was blotted dry, wrapped in SaranTM wrap, and immediately exposed to film. Uncapped RNAs were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 PNK, as described above. 5′-Labeled capped RNAs were generated with [α-32P]GTP and guanylyltransferase (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The capping reaction with guanylyltransferase transfers the m7G cap to only about 5% of the RNAs (Ambion product literature). To obtain sufficient signal (cpm/μl), it was therefore necessary to use 20-fold more RNA in the labeling reaction than for the virtually quantitative labeling of the uncapped RNAs. Following the respective labeling reactions, the RNAs (in 0.01% Nonidet P-40) were partially hydrolyzed at 75 °C in 27 μl of freshly prepared buffer containing 2 m urea, 17 mm NaOH. Several aliquots (6 μl) were removed over 15 min and quenched on ice with 100 μl of a buffer containing 1 mm HCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.5. The extent of hydrolysis in each aliquot was assessed by denaturing PAGE. Aliquots were occasionally combined to create a uniform distribution of the different RNA species. The RNAs were then ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. These RNA preparations were used as a substrate in binding reactions that were conducted as described above. Bound and free RNAs were separated by nondenaturing PAGE, also as described above, except that glycerol was omitted from the gel. Next, RNAs were visualized in the gel with Kodak Biomax MS maximum sensitivity film. Bound and free RNAs were excised and eluted in 3 ml of elution buffer (300 mm NaOAc, 0.5% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) overnight and recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Subsequently, the samples were electrophoresed on 8% denaturing gels. These gels were dried, and the individual RNA species were visualized with the Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Translation was measured in a nuclease-treated RRL system (Promega). Reactions were performed in a volume of 7.5 μl, with 60% (v/v) RRL, 20 ng/μl Promega luciferase control RNA (RNA concentrations were saturating; data not shown), and inhibitor RNAs, as indicated, for 30 min at 30 °C (linear phase of translation). To quantify light output, the entire reaction was diluted 10-fold with water, and 1 μl of the dilution was added to 100 μl of Firefly luciferase assay reagent (Promega). The mixture was briefly vortexed, and light units were read with a Turner Biosystems TD-20/20 single tube luminometer set to pause for 2 s and read for 10 s. The degree of inhibition is given as the ratio of light units measured with and without inhibitor.

Open table in a new tab To analyze RNA binding by eIF4F, we first measured equilibrium binding of eIF4F to an uncapped, 158-nt RNA using a PAGE-based gel shift assay (Fig. 1A). eIF4F, purified from RRL (12Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bound the RNA with an apparent dissociation constant of K½,app = 31 ± 13 nm (Fig. 1B and Table 2). A sigmoidal binding curve was recorded, consistent with cooperative binding of multiple eIF4F complexes to the RNA (Fig. 1B). We then measured eIF4F binding to the same 158-nt RNA with a m7G cap. We observed a sigmoidal binding curve with an apparent dissociation constant highly similar to the one measured for the uncapped RNA (Fig. 1B). Filter binding assays also yielded highly similar dissociation constants for capped and uncapped RNA, demonstrating that this observation did not depend on the nature of the binding assay (data not shown). Addition of ATP and/or eIF4B did not change the sigmoidal shape of the binding curves or the apparent dissociation constant for capped or uncapped RNA (Table 2 and data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that the m7G cap does not affect equilibrium binding of eIF4F, and multiple units of eIF4F associate cooperatively with this RNA. To examine whether these observations were specific for the 158-nt RNA used, we measured eIF4F binding to two additional RNAs, both capped and uncapped (Table 2). One of the RNAs, a 70-nt unstructured RNA derived from the binding site of the Escherichia coli TRAP protein (22Gollnick P. Babitzke P. Antson A. Yanofsky C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), is not a natural substrate for eIF4F. The other RNA, a 419-nt 5′-terminal fragment of the β-globin mRNA that included the entire 55-nt 5′-untranslated region, is a natural substrate for eIF4F. For all three RNAs, K½,app for capped and uncapped RNAs differed by less than a factor of 2 (Table 2), which is miniscule in energetic terms (ΔΔG0 < 0.4 kcal·mol−1). eIF4F bound cooperatively to all RNAs (n >2), indicating association of multiple eIF4F units to all substrates (Table 2). Addition of ATP and/or eIF4B did not have significant effects on the measured parameters (Table 2 and data not shown). Inclusion of the cap analog at concentrations 3.5-fold higher than eIF4F saturation did not inhibit capped or uncapped RNA binding or alter the measured affinities (data not shown). Taken together, the equilibrium binding data for the three different RNAs provide two main insights. First, the m7G cap does not provide a significant energetic contribution to RNA binding by eIF4F, irrespective of whether or not a given RNA represents a physiological substrate for eIF4F. Second, multiple eIF4Fs bind RNA in a cooperative fashion. Because these observations were not consistent with preferential binding of eIF4F to the m7G cap, it was important to confirm that the RNAs contained a functional m7G cap and that the cap-binding protein eIF4E remained part of the eIF4F complex during the experimental procedure. To verify the presence of a functional m7G cap, we employed toeprint analysis of the RNA in RRL (Fig. 2). This assay monitors assembly of the initiation complex and the subsequent scanning step on the RNA through inhibition of primer extension (21Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 23Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Traut R. Gold L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In the presence of cycloheximide, which stabilizes 80 S complex formation, on capped RNA, we readily detected the hallmark toeprint of the edge of the 80 S complex at (+)14 to (+)18 nt from the start codon (Fig. 2, lane 4). With uncapped RNA, the toeprint was much less pronounced (Fig. 2, lane 3). These data indicate that the initiation complex reaches the initiation codon more efficiently on the capped RNA. Similar results were obtained in the presence of GMP-PNP, which stabilizes the 48 S complex on the start codon. The corresponding toeprint at (+)14 to (+)16 also appeared more readily with capped than with uncapped RNA (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). Incubation of the samples on ice, which greatly slows the formation of the initiation complexes (20Pisarev A.V. Unbehaun A. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 430: 147-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), verified that the toeprints marked initiation complexes (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The results of the toeprint analysis thus clearly indicated a functional m7G cap, which enhanced assembly of the 80 S and 48 S complex on the start codon, compared with uncapped RNA. To test whether the cap-binding protein eIF4E remained part of the eIF4F complex during the binding reaction, we employed native Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). We incubated eIF4F with RNA and applied the samples to nondenaturing PAGE to separate bound from free eIF4E. The protein was then transferred to a membrane and probed with anti-eIF4E antibody. eIF4F without RNA was used to determine the mobility of eIF4E/eIF4F not bound to the RNA, and denatured eIF4F was used to determine the mobility of eIF4E dissociated from the eIF4F complex (Fig. 3). eIF4F without RNA showed reduced mobility compared with the heat-denatured complex, indicating complete retention of eIF4E within eIF4F (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). Incubation with RNA produced a supershift, indicating eIF4E bound to the RNA through eIF4F (Fig. 3, lane 3). No eIF4E corresponding to dissociated eIF4E was observed, demonstrating that eIF4E remained part of the eIF4F complex during the RNA binding procedure. The integrity of the eIF4F complex and the presence of functional m7G cap on the RNA ruled out trivial explanations for the lack of a significant contribution of the m7G cap to eIF4F-RNA binding. However, the RNAs used in the binding experiments above were all longer than 70 nt, and it remained possible that the m7G cap contributed more significantly to eIF4F binding to shorter RNAs. To test this possibility, we investigated binding of eIF4F to several capped and uncapped RNAs with 37 and fewer nucleotides. The affinity of eIF4F for all of these RNAs was too low to measure with our PAGE-based binding assay (data not shown). Supplementation of other translation factors (eIF4B, eIF4H, eIF3, additional eIF4A, all with or without 1 mm ATP/MgCl2) did not facilitate measurable binding of eIF4F to the RNAs (data not shown). These results suggested that eIF4F was unable to bind to RNAs with less than 37 nt with high affinity, irrespective of the presence of an m7G cap. To more systematically determine the minimal RNA length required by eIF4F for high affinity binding, we measured eIF4F binding to a pool of RNAs with different lengths (Fig. 4). The RNA pool was generated by subjecting a 5′-radiolabeled 158-nt RNA to limited alkaline hydrolysis (Fig. 4, step 1). Uncapped RNAs were labeled at the 5′-triphosphate and capped RNAs at the m7G cap (“Experimental Procedures”). The limited alkaline hydrolysis yielded a population of 5′ end-labeled RNAs with all lengths represented (Fig. 4, step 1). Increasing concentrations of eIF4F were incubated with this RNA pool, and these reactions were then applied to nondenaturing PAGE to separate bound and free RNA species (Fig. 4, step 2). Bound and free RNA species were isolated from the gel, and the size of the RNA was identified on denaturing PAGE (Fig. 4, step 3). For uncapped RNA, long RNAs were preferentially bound by eIF4F, whereas shorter RNAs remained free (Fig. 5A). A sharp cutoff, more pronounced with increasing eIF4F concentrations, was observed for RNAs longer than ∼60 nt (Fig. 5A, lane 5 and C). Nucleic acid-binding proteins are known to generally prefer longer nucleic acids, because of the increased number of registers available for association (24Kelly R.C. Jensen D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7240-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these statistical factors lead to a gradual increase in the fraction of bound nucleic acid, not to a sharp cutoff. Our data thus indicate that the preferential binding of longer RNAs by eIF4F is not because of higher binding probability from the higher number of binding sites. The experiments with capped RNA could only be performed with subsaturating concentrations of eIF4F relative to the overall concentration of RNA. This is because, under labeling conditions, guanylyltransferase forms an m7G cap on only a fraction (∼5%) of the RNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). To nonetheless obtain a strong signal, we needed to increase the overall RNA level in the binding reaction, and significant concentrations of unlabeled uncapped RNA remained present. Although unlabeled RNAs were invisible, they could compete with the binding of eIF4F to the labeled, capped RNA. Consequently and expectedly, not all labeled RNA was quantitatively bound, even at high eIF4F concentrations (Fig. 5B, lanes 6 and 8). Notwithstanding, a sharp cutoff for eIF4F binding at RNA length slightly above 60 nt was seen (Fig. 5B), similar to the observations made with uncapped RNA (Fig. 5B). The cutoff again increased in strength at higher eIF4F concentrations"
https://openalex.org/W2077074249,"Mutations in Sizn1 (Zcchc12), a novel transcriptional co-activator in the BMP signaling pathway, are associated with X-linked mental retardation. Previously, we demonstrated that Sizn1 positively modulates the BMP signal by interacting with Smad family members and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein. To further define the molecular basis of Sizn1 function, we have explored its subcellular localization and generated various deletion mutants to carry out domain analyses. Here, we report that Sizn1 localizes to promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). Sizn1 deletion mutants that disrupt the MA homologous domain or the middle region fail to target to the PML-NB. We show that two SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) in Sizn1 can bind to SUMO and govern SUMO conjugation to Sizn1 in the absence of the consensus motif for SUMO attachment. Interestingly, the SIM mutant Sizn1 localizes to nuclear bodies, but not to PML-NBs. Thus, SIMs mediate the localization of Sizn1 to PML-NB. Interestingly, mutations in SIM sequences and deletion of the MA homologous domain also affected the transcriptional co-activation function of a Sizn1. Taken together, our data indicate that the SIMs in Sizn1 are required for its PML-NB localization and for the full transcriptional co-activation function in BMP signaling."

However, its molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To determine the molecular mechanisms of NSC-741909-induced antitumor activity, we analyzed the changes of 77 protein biomarkers in a sensitive lung cancer cell line after treatment with this compound by using reverse-phase protein microarray. The results showed that phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (P38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK) were persistently elevated by the treatment with NSC-741909. However, only the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 effectively blocked the apoptosis induced by NSC-741909. Moreover, NSC-741909-mediated apoptosis was also blocked by a dominant-negative JNK construct, suggesting that sustained activation of JNK is critical for the apoptosis induction. Further studies revealed that treatment with NSC-741909 suppressed dephosphorylation of JNK and the expression of MAPK phosphatase-1. Thus, NSC-741909-mediated inhibition of JNK dephosphorylation results in sustained JNK activation, which leads to apoptosis in cancer cells.

Because of genetic and epigenetic changes in cancer cells, it is possible to identify tumor-selective cytotoxic agents by synthetic lethality screening for compounds that kill isogenic cancer cells but not their normal counterparts (1Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). The term synthetic lethality was originally used to describe a lethal phenotype caused by mutations of two genes (2Dobzhansky T.H. Genetics. 1946; 31: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. mutations of the two genes are lethal if they occur together but viable if they occur separately. A synthetically lethal phenotype often indicates that the two genes or two related pathways affect a common essential biologic function. Unfortunately, our current knowledge of molecular networks in normal or cancer cells is not adequate for us to predict what genes are synthetically lethal partners to an oncogene or a mutated tumor suppressor gene. Nevertheless, synthetic lethality screening allows us to identify cytotoxic agents specific for certain cancer cells because a compound targeting to such a partner can be identified by their lethality when administered to cancer cells with elevated activities of a particular oncogene. Using synthetic lethality screening, we recently identified an indole compound (designated oncrasin-1) that kills immortalized and tumorigenic human ovarian epithelial cells expressing mutant K-Ras but not cells expressing wild-type Ras genes (3Guo W. Wu S. Liu J. Fang B. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7403-7408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this compound effectively induced apoptosis at low micromolar or nanomolar concentrations in a variety of lung cancer cells with K-Ras mutations but did not kill cells with wild-type Ras genes. Molecular characterization revealed that oncrasin-1 can induce abnormal aggregation of protein kinase C-ι in the nucleus of oncrasin-sensitive cells but not in oncrasin-resistant cells and that oncrasin-1-induced apoptosis was blocked by siRNA 3The abbreviations used are: siRNAsmall interfering RNAJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseMAPmitogen-activated proteinMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMEKMAPK/ERK kinaseHAhemagglutininPBSphosphate-buffered salineTNFtumor necrosis factorDMSOdimethyl sulfoxidedndominant-negative. of K-Ras or protein kinase C-ι (3Guo W.

Our search for oncrasin-1 analogues identified several active compounds with similar chemical structures. Testing of one of the oncrasin-1 analogues, oncrasin-60 (NSC-741909), on NCI-60 cancer cell lines showed that it is highly active against several cell lines derived from lung, colon, breast, ovary, and kidney cancers and that it lies outside the category of adequately studied classes of antitumor agents, suggesting that those compounds could be novel anticancer agents. However, the mechanisms of apoptosis induction by oncrasin compounds remain to be characterized. Here, we used reverse-phase protein array to determine molecular changes induced by NSC-741909 in a sensitive cell line.

The human non-small cell lung carcinoma H460 and H157 cell lines were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. We also used human ovarian surface epithelial cells immortalized with the catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase and the SV40 early genomic region (designated T29) and its tumorigenic derivatives transformed with mutant K-Ras (T29Kt1) (5Liu J. Yang G. Thompson-Lanza J.A. Glassman A. Hayes K. Patterson A. Marquez R.T. Auersperg N. Yu Y. Hahn W.C. Mills G.B. Bast Jr., R.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The culture conditions were the same as above. NSC-741909 was synthesized by Zhejiang Yuancheng MST Inc. (Hangzhou, China). The purity of this compound as determined by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrum analysis is 98.5%. The chemical structure was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum analysis. U0126, SB203580, and JNK inhibitor II (SP600125) were purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies to the following proteins were used for Western blot analysis: JNK, phospho-JNK, phospho-c-Jun, P38, phospho-P38, phospho-ERK, phospho-MKK7 (Cell Signaling), MKP1 (c-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (BD Pharmingen), caspase-8 (ALEXIS Biochemicals), β-actin, and hemagglutinin (HA) (Sigma). The cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in reverse-phase protein microarrays (RPPA) lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 100 mmol/liter NaF, 10 mmol/liter NaPPi, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin 10 μg/ml; alternatively, whole proteinase inhibitor tablets could be used (Roche Applied Science)) for 30 min with frequent vortexing on ice. The resultant solution was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm, the supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) assays and then adjusted to 1–1.5 mg/ml by lysis buffer. Cell lysates were mixed with one-quarter volume of 4× SDS sample buffer containing 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (freshly added). RPPA assay was performed at the Functional Proteomics Reverse-Phase Protein Array Core facility at our institution. Serial diluted cell lysates were printed on nitrocellulose-coated slides (Whatman, Inc) by using a G3 arrayer (Genomic Solutions). A total of 960 array spots could be arranged on each slide, including 96 spots corresponding to positive and negative controls prepared from dilution buffer. A total of 80–90 slides were made for each sample. Each slide was probed with a validated primary antibody plus a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody. The signal was amplified using a DakoCytomation-catalyzed system (Dako) and visualized by a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride colorimetric reaction. The slides were scanned, analyzed, and quantified using customized software, Microvigene (VigeneTech, Inc.), to generate spot intensity. Signals from each dilution were fitted with the logistic model developed by the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The protein concentrations of each set of slides were then normalized and corrected across samples by the linear expression values, using the median expression levels of all antibody experiments to calculate a loading correction factor for each sample. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. After overnight incubation, the cells were treated with NSC-741909 (0.03–10 μm) alone or in combination with different compounds for 24 h. The inhibitory effects of NSC-741909 alone or in combination with other agents on cell growth were determined using the sulforhodamine B assay, as described previously (6Rubinstein L.V. Shoemaker R.H. Paull K.D. Simon R.M. Tosini S. Skehan P. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate and repeated for a total of at least three times. The flow cytometric assay was performed as described previously (7Zhang L. Gu J. Lin T. Huang X. Roth J.A. Fang B. Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates and allowed to grow overnight. The cells were treated with NSC-741909 (1 μm) alone or in combination with different inhibitors for 24 h. The inhibitors were added 30 min before NSC-741909. After treatment, cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed by 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. Before analysis, cells were stained with propidium iodide for 30 min. Then the flow cytometric assay was used to measure the sub-G0/G1 cellular DNA content using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). The flow cytometric assays were performed in the Core Laboratory of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Cells were harvested and subjected to lysis in Laemmli lysis buffer. Equal amounts of lysates (40 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Hybond-enhanced chemiluminescence membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were then blocked with PBS buffer containing 5% low fat milk and 0.05% Tween (PBST) for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After being washed three times with PBST, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with PBST again and developed with a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences). β-Actin was used as a loading control. H157 cells were transfected with the plasmid pLNCX-3X/HA-p46JNK1α (dnJNK1 (dominant-negative JNK1 mutant construct)) (kindly provided by Dr. L. E. Heasley, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO) (8Wojtaszek P.A. Heasley L.E. Siriwardana G. Berl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 800-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which encoded an HA-tagged dominant-negative JNK1 mutant whose phosphorylation site, Thr-Pro-Tyr (TPY), is altered to Ala-Pro-Phe (APF). The retroviral vector encoding dnJNK1 was then prepared from 293/Phoenix cells and used to infect target cells. Stable transfectants were selected for growth in the presence of 500 μg/ml Geneticin (G418). Plasmid or siRNA transfection was performed with FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) or ON-TARGETplus siRNA reagents (Dharmacon). Total JNK phosphatase activity was determined as reported earlier (9Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and proteinase inhibitor complex. After 20 min of centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, JNK1/2 were removed from the supernatants by immunoprecipitation, and the immunodepleted lysates were mixed with phosphorylated JNK1/2 isolated from H460 cells 4 h after treatment with 1 μm NSC-741909 at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 2% SDS and separated by SDS-PAGE. Dephosphorylation of activated JNK was then detected with an anti-phospho-JNK antibody. Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). A 500-ng aliquot of each RNA sample was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction volume using the Taqman reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). The 10-fold dilutions of the cDNA product were used in real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was carried out in 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 2 μl of diluted cDNA, 10 μl of 2× Absolute Blue QPCR SYBR Green mix buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5.2 μl of double-distilled water, and 1.4 μl each of sense and antisense primers (70 nm final concentration). Real-time PCR assays were performed in triplicate using a CRF96TM real-time system (Bio-Rad) with the following conditions: 95 °C for 15 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The following primer sequences for the genes were used: MKP1, sense 5′-CCAGTACAAGAGCATCCCTGT-3′, and antisense 5′- AGTGGACAAACACCCTTCCTC-3′; GAPDH, sense 5′- GGCTCTCCAGAACATCATCC-3′, and antisense 5′-TAGCCCAGGATGCCCTT-3′. The sets of gene primer for the target gene MKP1 were confirmed to have amplification efficiency equal to that of the reference gene GAPDH. The relative RNA expression was calculated automatically by the installed software of the instrument with the ΔΔCt method, using GAPDH as a reference gene. Differences between treatment groups were assessed using the unpaired Student's t test at a significance level of p < 0.05. After we identified oncrasin-1 through synthetic lethality screening (3Guo W. Wu S. Liu J. Fang B. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7403-7408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we tested a number of analogues with similar chemical structure and found that several were very active in T29Kt1 and H460 cells that harbor mutant K-Ras but were inactive in T29 cells with wild-type Ras genes. We submitted a few highly active compounds, including NSC-741909 (oncrasin-60, Fig. 1a), to the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program (National Institutes of Health) for testing their effect on a panel of 60 cancer cell lines derived from various tissues and organs. The test performed at the NCI (National Institutes of Health) showed that NSC-741909 was active against a number of cancer cell lines derived from non-small-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, and breast cancer. Among 54 of the cancer cell lines tested, the median 50% growth inhibitory concentration (GI50) for NSC-741909 was 1.12 μm. For five of the most sensitive cell lines, the GI50 was <10−8m or 10 nm, the lowest concentration tested by the NCI (National Institutes of Health) (Fig. 1b). The analysis performed by the Developmental Therapeutics Program at the NCI (National Institutes of Health) also showed that NSC-741909 lies outside the category of adequately studied classes of antitumor agents, suggesting that it has novel anticancer mechanisms. This compound is currently under preclinical evaluation for its in vivo efficacy and toxicity by the Rapid Access to Intervention Development (RAID) Program at the NCI (National Institutes of Health). To characterize molecular changes induced by NSC-741909, we treated H460 cells with 1 μm NSC-741909 (a concentration around IC80) and harvested the cells at various time points after the treatment; cells treated with solvent alone (DMSO) were used as controls. The samples were then immobilized in RPPA, and each array was tested with a validated antibody specific to a particular protein or a particular post-translational modification of a protein. Seventy-seven antibodies specific for proteins or their post-translational modifications that are involved in various signaling pathways were used in the RPPA analysis (Fig. 2a). The result showed that treatment with NSC-741909 dramatically increased the signal intensity of phosphorylated P38 (p38.pT180.Y182), phosphorylated JNK (JNK.pT180.Y182), and phosphorylated ERK (MAPK.pT202.Y204) when compared with results for control cells. The increase of those phosphorylation signals occurred as early as 1 h after treatment and were as high as >100-fold for JNK (Fig. 2b). In comparison, the signal changes for other proteins or post-translational modifications were insignificant. To verify the results of the RPPA assay, we treated two oncrasin-sensitive cell lines, H460 (1 μm) and T29Kt1 (10 μm, also around IC80 for this cell line), and one oncrasin-resistant cell line, T29 (10 μm), with NSC-741909 and harvested the cells at 0, 8, and 12 h after the treatment. Western blot analysis showed that treatment with NSC-741909 induced dramatic up-regulation of phospho-JNK, phospho-P38, and phospho-ERK at 8 and 12 h after treatment in the two sensitive cell lines but not in the resistant cell line (Fig. 3a). We then evaluated the time-dependent changes of these signal molecule alterations after NSC-741909 treatment in H460 cells. The results showed that the phosphorylations of JNK, P38 MAPK, and p44/p42 ERK were induced as early as 30 min after NSC-741909 treatment, whereas the expression of basal JNK or basal P38 MAPK was not affected (Fig. 3b). The elevation of phosphorylated JNK, P38, and ERK lasted for at least 15 h after treatment (Fig. 3b). We also evaluated the dose response of JNK phosphorylation after treatment with NSC-741909 for 6 h. The result showed that induction of JNK phosphorylation by NSC-741909 was dose-dependent and occurred at the dose of 50 nm (Fig. 3c). Moreover, there is no apparent cell viability change(s) or apoptosis induction at 6 h after treatment with all the concentrations tested (up to 1 μm, data not shown). Together, these results suggest that treatment with NSC-741909 induced activation of JNK, which occurred before cell growth suppression and apoptosis induction. To investigate whether any MAP kinases activated by NSC-741909 were involved in NSC-741909-mediated cell killing, we evaluated combination effects of NSC-741909 with kinase inhibitors for JNK (SP600125, also called JNK inhibitor II), P38 MAPK (SB203580), and MEK (U0126). We treated the sensitive human lung cancer cell lines H460 (Fig. 3d) and H157 (Fig. 3e) with 0.03–10 μm NSC-741909 alone or in combination with different inhibitors for 24 h. Cell viability was then determined by using the sulforhodamine B assay. The results showed that the presence of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 μm) significantly blocked the cell death induced by NSC-741909 (1 μm) in both H460 and H157 cell lines. The IC50 for NSC-741909 in the presence of SP600125 was about 10-fold greater than that for NSC-741909 alone. The MEK-specific inhibitor U0126 (20 μm) and the P38 inhibitor SB203580 (20 μm) had either no effects or only minor effects on NSC-741909-induced suppression of cell growth. These data suggest that JNK activation was critical in NSC-741909-mediated cell killing. To further evaluate the role of MAPK activation in NSC-741909-mediated cell killing, we tested the effects of three MAP kinase inhibitors on apoptosis induction by NSC-741909. H460 cells were treated with 1 μm NSC-741909 for 24 h, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis. The result showed that treatment with NSC-741909 led to a significantly greater proportion of cells in sub-G1 phase when compared with cells treated with solvent (Fig. 4a). Treatment of H460 cells with SP600125 (10 μm), U0126 (20 μm), or SB203580 (20 μm) alone did not affect the cell growth cycle or induce apoptosis. The presence of SP600125 (10 μm) markedly diminished NSC-741909-induced apoptosis. The proportion of apoptotic cells was 35.7% in the cells treated with NSC-741909 alone but only 7.7% in the cells treated with NSC-741909 plus SP600125. In contrast, the presence of either U0126 or SB203580 had only a minor effect on NSC-741909-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4b). The effect of SP600125 on NSC-741909-induced apoptosis was further verified by Western blot analysis. The presence of SP600125 (10 μm) markedly blocked the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun induced by NSC-741909 (1 μm) but had no obvious effects on the basal JNK level (Fig. 4c), suggesting that SP600125 (10 μm) was sufficient to block activation of JNK by NSC-741909. Cleavages of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-8 after treatment with NSC-741909 were also attenuated in the presence of SP600125 (Fig. 4c). Together, these results indicate that JNK activation contributes to NSC-741909-mediated apoptosis, although NSC-741909 activated all three MAPK signaling pathways. To further evaluate the role of JNK activation in NSC-741909-induced apoptosis, we determined cell growth suppression and apoptosis induction by NSC-741909 in cells of the human lung cancer cell line H157 stably transfected with a HA-tagged dnJNK1. H157 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing dnJNK1 or with a control plasmid. After selection with G418, H157 clones expressing dnJNK1 were identified by Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 5a). Parental, vector-transfected, or dnJNK1-transfected H157 cells were then analyzed for their susceptibility to NSC-741909. Dose-response analysis showed that H157 cells expressing dnJNK1 had a dramatic shift of their dose-response curves to the right (Fig. 5b). The IC50 for NSC-741909 in two dnJNK1 stably transfected H157 clones increased about 10-fold when compared with parental and vector-transfected cells. Similarly, flow cytometric analysis indicated that the introduction of dnJNK1 to H157 protected cells from NSC-741909-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5c) when compared with parental H157 cells or H157 infected with control vector. JNKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif in the activation loop through mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) and 7 (MKK7) and inactivated by dephosphorylation through a group of MAP kinase phosphatases (10Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar, 11Lin A. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To investigate whether NSC-741909-induced JNK activation is caused by elevated activity of upstream kinases or by decreased activity of MAP kinase phosphatases, we tested the changes of phospho-MKK4, phospho-MKK7, and MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1) in H460 cells after treatment with NSC-741909. The activity of MKK7 is regulated by phosphorylation of Ser/Thr in a conserved region of the kinase domain through its upstream kinases such as MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) and the Ser/Thr kinase STE20-like protein kinases (12Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). H460 cells treated with 1 μm NSC-741909 were harvested at various time points. Western blot analysis showed that treatment with NSC-741909 had no obvious effect on phosphorylation of MKK7 (Ser-271/Thr-275). Analysis on phospho-MKK4 was not informative because no signal was detected in all samples. In contrast, treatment with NSC-741909 resulted in a dramatic reduction of MKP1, which correlated with the time course of JNK activation (Fig. 6a). The NSC-741909-induced suppression of MKP1 is also dose-dependent when evaluated at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3 μm. Suppression of MKP1 was detectable at 0.1 μm and became more obvious at 0.3–3 μm, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6b). To test whether the NSC-741909-induced decrease of MKP1 level was caused by inhibition of transcription, we tested the changes of MKP1 mRNA after NSC-741909 treatment with real-time PCR. The results showed that NSC-741909 induced the increase of MKP1 mRNA expression in both a time-dependent and a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6d). The peak occurred at 1 h after treatment, which had a 5–10-fold increase when compared with DMSO-treated control. This result indicates that NSC-741909 may suppress MKP1 expression at the post-transcriptional level. Increased MKP1 mRNA expression might reflect a negative feedback to its protein level decrease caused by NSC-741909. Reduced MKP1 protein levels by NSC-741909 suggested that increased JNK phosphorylation may be caused by suppression of JNK dephosphorylation. To investigate whether JNK dephosphorylation was inhibited by NSC-741909 treatment, we incubated activated JNK with active JNK-depleted lysates of untreated and NSC-741909-treated cells. Activated JNK was isolated by immunoprecipitation from H460 cells treated with 1 μm NSC-741909 for 4 h. Similarly, we depleted active JNK from the lysates of untreated and NSC-741909-treated cells by immunoprecipitation. The cell lysates after depletion were divided into two equal parts. Half of them were used for verification of the depletion efficiency, and the other half were incubated with an equal amount of activated JNK in a phosphatase buffer. Dephosphorylation of activated JNK was then detected with an anti-phospho-JNK antibody. The phospho-JNK was dramatically reduced when incubated with lysates from control cells but remained unchanged when incubated with lysates from cells treated with NSC-741909 for 0.5–4 h (Fig. 6c). Together, the above results demonstrated that NSC-741909-mediated sustained JNK activation is caused by the inhibition of JNK dephosphorylation. We also tested whether inhibition of MKP1 expression itself is sufficient to induce apoptosis. For this purpose, H460 cells were treated with MKP1 siRNA or control siRNA. Apoptosis was determined at 72 h after the treatment. The result showed that transfection with MKP1 siRNA led to a dramatic increase of apoptotic (sub-G1) cells when compared with mock-treated or control siRNA-treated cells The proportion of apoptotic cells was 20.7% in the MKP1 siRNA-treated cells but only 0.45% in mock-treated and 6.97% in the control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 6, e and f), suggesting that suppression of MKP1 is sufficient to induce apoptosis in some cancer cells. In the current study, we characterized the antitumor activity mechanism of NSC-741909, an analogue of oncrasin-1 that we recently identified as inducing synthetic lethality with oncogenic K-Ras and protein kinase C-ι (3Guo W. Wu S. Liu J. Fang B. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7403-7408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Tests on NCI-60 cancer cell lines found that NSC-741909 was highly active against several cell lines derived from lung, colon, breast, ovary, and kidney cancers. Here, we used RPPA to detect molecular changes induced by NSC-741909 treatment. The advantage of RPPA is that a single test probe (antibody) is used for each array so that the testing condition will be consistent for each antibody, thereby providing better reproducibility and sensitivity when compared with other protein array techniques. Our results showed that treatment with NSC-741909 induced activation of MAP kinases, including JNK, P38, and ERK, that activation of JNK contributed to NSC-741909-mediated apoptosis, and that pan-activation of MAP kinases is likely caused by suppression of MAP kinase phosphatases. It is not clear whether Ras signaling pathways facilitate NSC-741909-induced activation of MAP kinases. Nevertheless, MAP kinases are known downstream effectors of Ras signaling pathways. Among these pathways, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is the most well characterized in Ras-induced proliferation and transformation (13Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Indeed, a compound named erastin was recently reported to induce non-apoptotic cell death in oncogenic Ras-transfected cells through a mechanism involved in the Ras-Raf-Mek pathway (14Yagoda N. von Rechenberg M. Zaganjor E. Bauer A.J. Yang W.S. Fridman D.J. Wolpaw A.J. Smukste I. Peltier J.M. Boniface J.J. Smith R. Lessnick S.L. Sahasrabudhe S. Stockwell B.R. Nature. 2007; 447: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we have evaluated the effects of oncrasin compounds on the Ras-Raf-Mek pathway and did not find a direct association with this pathway. It is noteworthy that, in addition to the Ras-Raf-Mek pathway, many other signaling pathways were also regulated by Ras, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Ral family of GTPases. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been implicated in activation of the small GTPase Rac (15Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rac functions as an activator of a number of the MAP kinases, including JNK (16Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 17Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Evidence has also indicated that JNK and Jun proteins complexed with Ras proteins and mediated Ras signaling transductions (18Adler V. Pincus M.R. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Ronai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 10585-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). JNK was originally identified as oncogenic Ras and UV light-responsive protein kinase that binds and phosphorylates the c-Jun activation domain (19Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar, 20Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). The Ras proteins can directly bind to JNK and c-Jun and regulate their function in a dose-dependent manner (18Adler V. Pincus M.R. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Ronai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 10585-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Studies of the effect of Jnk gene disruption on Ras-induced transformation of murine fibroblasts indicate that JNK may act as a suppressor of Ras transformation and that the JNK signaling pathway contributes to the apoptotic elimination of Ras-transformed cells in vivo (22Kennedy N.J. Davis R.J. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 199-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kennedy N.J. Sluss H.K. Jones S.N. Bar-Sagi D. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In fact, agents such as capsaicin and anisomycin can selectively induce apoptosis in Ras-transformed cells but not in their normal cell counterparts through JNK-dependent pathway (24Kang H.J. Soh Y. Kim M.S. Lee E.J. Surh Y.J. Kim H.R. Kim S.H. Moon A. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Santibañez J.F. Hurtado C. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6459-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Those results collectively suggested that JNK signaling pathways can also be explored for induction of apoptosis in Ras transformed cells. JNKs are a group of MAP kinases that play crucial roles in several physiological processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (10Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). JNKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif in the activation loop through MKK4 and MKK7. Dephosphorylation by a group of MAP kinase phosphatases ultimately leads to inactivation of JNK (10Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar, 11Lin A. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The biological consequences of JNK activation may depend on the cell type, the nature of the stimulus, the duration of JNK activation, and the activity of other signaling pathways. Evidences have found that JNK activation is required for apoptosis induced by various stress stimuli (11Lin A. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 26Deng Y. Ren X. Yang L. Lin Y. Wu X. Cell. 2003; 115: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 27Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 28Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 29Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar); however, most forms of environmental stress that are sufficient for JNK activation do not cause apoptosis (10Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar), suggesting that JNK activation is necessary but not sufficient for apoptosis. Moreover, evidence suggests either that a JNK-dependent pathway is required for TNF-α-induced apoptosis (26Deng Y. Ren X. Yang L. Lin Y. Wu X. Cell. 2003; 115: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) or that JNK activation is not involved in the induction of apoptosis by TNF-α (30Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). These inconsistencies are presumably due to the difference in cellular contexts and duration of JNK activation. TNF-α-induced JNK activation was transient in TNF-α-resistant human breast carcinoma MCF-7-R cells but was prolonged in TNF-α-sensitive MCF-7 cells. Restoration of transient JNK activation in the MCF-7 cells blocked TNF-α-induced apoptosis (31Tang F. Tang G. Xiang J. Dai Q. Rosner M.R. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), indicating that prolonged JNK activation is crucial for the proapoptotic function of JNK. Our data showed that NSC-741909-mediated increase of phospho-JNK is primarily caused by suppression of JNK dephosphorylation but not by the activation of its upstream kinases. Reduced expression of MKP1 may contribute to NSC-741909-mediated JNK dephosphorylation. However, involvement of other MAP kinase phosphatases is also possible. As a group of dual specificity phosphatases, MAPK phosphatases can effectively dephosphorylate both phospho-tyrosine and phospho-threonine residues on MAPKs (32Jeffrey K.L. Camps M. Rommel C. Mackay C.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Suppression of MAPK phosphatase expressions or their activities is expected to break the balances between the phosphorylating kinases and dephosphorylating phosphatases, thereby dramatically altering MAPK signaling activities. Interestingly, a combination of computational and experimental analysis had revealed that MAPK phosphatases, but not the kinases, dictate the extent of MAPK phosphorylation (21Bhalla U.S. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 297: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Because treatment with NSC-741909 also activated P38 and ERK, it is possible that several of the MAPK phosphatases were suppressed by NSC-741909. Together, our results suggested that NSC-741909, as a novel antitumor agent, has selective cell killing activity in a subgroup of cancer cell lines and that sustained JNK activation due to inhibition of JNK dephosphorylation is one of primary effects of the anticancer activity of NSC-741909.

https://openalex.org/W2149432382,"Development, cancer, neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases, injury, and stem cell manipulations are characterised by alterations in cell number. Research into development, disease, and the effects of drugs require cell number counts. These are generally indirect estimates, because counting cells in an animal or organ is paradoxically difficult, as well as being tedious and unmanageable. Drosophila is a powerful model organism used to investigate the genetic bases of development and disease. There are Drosophila models for multiple neurodegenerative diseases, characterised by an increase in cell death. However, a fast, reliable, and accurate way to count the number of dying cells in vivo is not available. Here, we present a method based on image filtering and mathematical morphology techniques, to count automatically the number of dying cells in intact fruit-fly embryos. We call the resulting programme DeadEasy Caspase. It has been validated for Drosophila and we present examples of its power to address biological questions. Quantification is automatic, accurate, objective, and very fast. DeadEasy Caspase will be freely available as an ImageJ plug-in, and it can be modified for use in other sample types.

https://openalex.org/W2023467973,"Background A variety of N-glycans attached to protein are known to involve in many important biological functions. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localized enzymes are responsible to this template-independent glycan synthesis resulting glycoforms at each asparagine residues. The regulation mechanism such glycan synthesis remains largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to investigate the relationship between glycan structure and protein conformation, we analyzed a glycoprotein of Drosophila melanogaster, chaoptin (Chp), which is localized in photoreceptor cells and is bound to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Detailed analysis based on mass spectrometry revealed the presence of 13 N-glycosylation sites and the composition of the glycoform at each site. The synthetic pathway of glycans was speculated from the observed glycan structures and the composition at each N-glycosylation site, where the presence of novel routes were suggested. The distribution of glycoforms on a Chp polypeptide suggested that various processing enzymes act on the exterior of Chp in the Golgi apparatus, although virtually no enzyme can gain access to the interior of the horseshoe-shaped scaffold, hence explaining the presence of longer glycans within the interior. Furthermore, analysis of Chp from a mutant (RNAi against dolichyl-phosphate α-d-mannosyltransferase), which affects N-glycan synthesis in the ER, revealed that truncated glycan structures were processed. As a result, the distribution of glycoforms was affected for the high-mannose-type glycans only, whereas other types of glycans remained similar to those observed in the control and wild-type. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that glycan processing depends largely on the backbone structure of the parent polypeptide. The information we obtained can be applied to other members of the LRR family of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1976568506,"Representing one's own body is often viewed as a basic form of self-awareness. However, little is known about structural representations of the body in the brain.We developed an inter-manual version of the classical ""in-between"" finger gnosis task: participants judged whether the number of untouched fingers between two touched fingers was the same on both hands, or different. We thereby dissociated structural knowledge about fingers, specifying their order and relative position within a hand, from tactile sensory codes. Judgments following stimulation on homologous fingers were consistently more accurate than trials with no or partial homology. Further experiments showed that structural representations are more enduring than purely sensory codes, are used even when number of fingers is irrelevant to the task, and moreover involve an allocentric representation of finger order, independent of hand posture.Our results suggest the existence of an allocentric representation of body structure at higher stages of the somatosensory processing pathway, in addition to primary sensory representation."
https://openalex.org/W2059443835,"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have important functional roles in the cell: for example, they regulate gene expression by means of establishing stable joint structures with target mRNAs via complementary sequence motifs. Sequence motifs are also important determinants of the structure of ncRNAs. Although ncRNAs are abundant, discovering novel ncRNAs on genome sequences has proven to be a hard task; in particular past attempts for ab initio ncRNA search mostly failed with the exception of tools that can identify micro RNAs.We present a very general ab initio ncRNA gene finder that exploits differential distributions of sequence motifs between ncRNAs and background genome sequences.Our method, once trained on a set of ncRNAs from a given species, can be applied to a genome sequences of other organisms to find not only ncRNAs homologous to those in the training set but also others that potentially belong to novel (and perhaps unknown) ncRNA families.(http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/taverna/smyrna)."
https://openalex.org/W1992155000,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a key mediator in the development of Gram-negative septic shock, which is a major health problem. The effect of LPS on myeloid cells is mediated by a multicomplex receptor system in which CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein, and Toll-like receptor 4 are the major players. We have found that incubation of macrophages with itraconazole (ICZ), an azole antifungal commonly used in humans, altered both the expression and glycosylation of CD14. This glycoprotein, which is endo H-resistant in untreated cells, becomes endo H-sensitive following ICZ treatment. The effect of ICZ on glycan processing was observed in all newly synthesized glycoproteins as indicated by incorporation of [2-3H]mannose. In addition, cells treated with ICZ increased surface concanavalin A (ConA) binding, corroborating an increase in high mannose surface glycoproteins. Although the glycosylation pattern of CD14 was altered, this glycoprotein was delivered to the cell surface or was secreted. Moreover, it appeared functional as demonstrated by the release of LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-α under conditions specific for a CD14-mediated activation process.

LPS is a trigger for Gram-negative sepsis, which is a major heath problem in the United States (1Angus D.C. Linde-Zwirble W.T. Lidicker J. Clermont G. Carcillo J. Pinsky M.R. Crit.

Lancet. 2005; 365: 63-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). LPS is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and is recognized by specific surface receptors on myeloid cells. The major LPS binding site on macrophages is CD14, which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, leucine-rich repeat glycoprotein (3Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). The recognition of LPS by CD14 requires that the bacterial product associates first with LPS-binding protein. Then, the complex of CD14 and LPS interacts with Toll-like receptor 4 and MD-2 to initiate the release of cytokines and other effector molecules (4Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). The importance of CD14 in LPS signaling is illustrated by the fact that it enhances the recognition of LPS up to 1000-fold (5Moore K.J. Andersson L.P. Ingalls R.R. Monks B.G. Li R. Arnaout M.A. Golenbock D.T. Freeman M.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Moreover, CD14-deficient mice are LPS insensitive and resistant to septic shock (6Haziot A. Ferrero E. Köntgen F. Hijiya N. Yamamoto S. Silver J. Stewart C.L. Goyert S.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In addition to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane CD14 (mCD14), a soluble variant (sCD14) of this glycoprotein is found in the extracellular space and circulation.We have previously found that the expression of mCD14 in macrophages (Mϕs) is enhanced by lovastatin, which is a statin widely used for the treatment of hypercholesteremia. This elevation in CD14 expression was not correlated with a decrease in cellular cholesterol levels, but, rather, it was partially dependent on the depletion of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (7Frey T. De Maio A. Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which is a non-sterol isoprenoid product of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. These observations illustrate that the statin-mediated inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis has several additional side effects. This pathway is responsible for the synthesis of several important cellular products, such as the isoprenoid intermediates, which are involved in the post-translational modification of proteins. Consequently, the effect of statins on cellular physiology needs to be confirmed by using additional inhibitors for other steps in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. In an effort to understand if endogenously synthesized cholesterol affects CD14 expression, we used itraconazole (ICZ), which inhibits the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme 14α-demethylase, a key step in the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol. This step in the cholesterol pathway is downstream of the isoprenoid intermediates, avoiding the inhibitory effects on isoprenoid moieties. We found that treatment of Mϕs with ICZ altered the processing of glycoproteins from high mannose to complex structures. Thus, cells treated with ICZ displayed an enrichment of high mannose glycoproteins on the surface. Moreover, this effect of ICZ was independent of the cholesterol pathway and unique to this drug. This dramatic alteration in glycosylation may have a tremendous impact on cellular function and may be pertinent to patients taking ICZ.DISCUSSIONICZ is an azole antifungal agent widely used in humans. Although this drug has a broad spectrum of activity, it is particularly useful in the treatment of Aspergillus (11Zonios D.I. Bennett J.E. Semin. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2008; 29: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). ICZ inhibits fungal CYP450 oxidase-mediated synthesis of ergosterol, resulting in cell growth arrest. In mammals, ICZ is an inhibitor of the CYP450 enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase, which is involved in the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol. In the present study, we found that treatment of murine Mϕs with ICZ at pharmacological doses resulted in a dramatic alteration in the processing of newly synthesized N-linked oligosaccharides. Thus, treatment with ICZ resulted in an increase in high mannose structures. The preponderance of high mannose glycans and lack of conversion into complex structures was demonstrated by sensitivity to endo H digestion of newly synthesized glycoproteins after incorporation of [2-3H]mannose in cells treated with ICZ. In addition, the levels of high mannose glycan were elevated in cells treated with ICZ in comparison with control cells. Moreover, cells treated with ICZ displayed an elevated content of high mannose glycoconjugates on the surface as demonstrated by ConA binding.Surface glycoconjugates have been shown to play critical roles in the immune response, in particular during T-cell differentiation (12Lowe J.B. Cell. 2001; 104: 809-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in the pattern of cell surface glycoproteins have been observed during the maturation of thymocytes (13De Maio A. Lis H. Gershoni J.M. Sharon N. Cell. Immunol. 1986; 99: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Naïve (immature) CD8+ cortical thymocytes, which typically undergo an addition of sialic acid to the O-linked glycan Galβ1–3GalNacαThr/Ser during maturation, showed an enhancement of apoptosis, resulting in a reduction in their population in sialyltransferase (ST3Gal-I/ST3Gal-I)-null mice (14Priatel J.J. Chui D. Hiraoka N. Simmons C.J. Richardson K.B. Page D.M. Fukuda M. Varki N.M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The absence of fucosyltransferase (FucT-VII) resulted in defects in selectin-mediated T-cell trafficking (15Malý P. Thall A. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. von Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 643-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Alterations in N-linked glycosylation have also been linked to alterations in the immune response, in particular with autoimmunity. Ablation of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (Mgat5) results in a lack of candidate structures for polylactosamine and increased T-cell receptor signaling due to enhanced T-cell receptor clustering (16Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), resulting in autoimmune disease. It was recently demonstrated that lack of polylactosamine (a fundamental structure in both N- and O-glycans) in β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (β3GnT2)-deficient mice resulted in increased T-cell activation, hyperproliferation upon B-cell receptor stimulation, and enhanced activation of macrophages in response to endotoxin (17Togayachi A. Kozono Y. Ishida H. Abe S. Suzuki N. Tsunoda Y. Hagiwara K. Kuno A. Ohkura T. Sato N. Sato T. Hirabayashi J. Ikehara Y. Tachibana K. Narimatsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15829-15834Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Finally, a dramatic remodeling of N-glycans on the surface of CD4 and CD8 T-cells has been demonstrated following activation of these cells, which is due to alterations in the expression of key glycosyltransferases (18Comelli E.M. Sutton-Smith M. Yan Q. Amado M. Panico M. Gilmartin T. Whisenant T. Lanigan C.M. Head S.R. Goldberg D. Morris H.R. Dell A. Paulson J.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in α-mannosidase II, which displays reduced expression of complex N-glycans, develop autoimmune disease similar to human systemic lupus erythematosus (19Chui D. Sellakumar G. Green R. Sutton-Smith M. McQuistan T. Marek K. Morris H. Dell A. Marth J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This effect has recently been attributed to the presence of immune stimulatory mannose ligands for innate immune lectin receptors (20Green R.S. Stone E.L. Tenno M. Lehtonen E. Farquhar M.G. Marth J.D. Immunity. 2007; 27: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We showed that ICZ, at clinically relevant concentrations (21Kageyama S. Masuya M. Tanaka I. Oka K. Morita K. Tamaki S. Tsuji K. Katayama N. Sugimoto H. Kagawa Y. Kojima M. Shiku H. J. Infect. Chemother. 1999; 5: 213-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), resulted in a change of surface glycoproteins from complex to high mannose. Thus, it is possible that prolonged treatment with this drug may also result in the occurrence of autoimmune disease in patients.The effect of ICZ on glycosylation could not be correlated with a decrease in cellular cholesterol levels, because reduction of this sterol by treatment with NB-598 or incubation in lipoprotein-deficient serum did not affect glycoprotein processing. Moreover, the increase in high mannose glycans was not the product of lanosterol build-up, secondary to inhibition 14α-demethylase, as demonstrated by coincubation of ICZ with either lovastatin or NB-598, which are inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and squalene epoxidase, respectively. Treatment with other azoles, such as ketoconazole or econazole, did not alter glycosylation processing, suggesting that the effect of ICZ is not due to the inhibition of another CYP450 enzyme, such as epoxygenase (22Roman R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 131-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the effect of ICZ on glycosylation is distinctive and independent of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.ICZ has been shown to have unique effects on other systems as well. ICZ, but not ketoconazole, was found to demonstrate synergy with resident peritoneal murine macrophages in killing Blastomyces dermatitidis (23Brummer E. Bhagavathula P.R. Hanson L.H. Stevens D.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 2487-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ICZ and its derivative hydroxyitraconazole, but not econazole, fluconazole, miconazole, or ketoconazole were also shown to induce morphological changes in macrophages as determined by light and scanning electron microscopy (24Ochi H. Ishijima S.A. Abe S. Tameike A. Yamaguchi H. Osumi M. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1998; 20: 181-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, ICZ has recently been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in human endothelial cells, an effect that was unique to ICZ among all the azoles tested (25Chong C.R. Xu J. Lu J. Bhat S. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Liu J.O. ACS Chem. Biol. 2007; 2: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is possible that these observed effects of ICZ may be due to its ability to alter glycosylation and therefore function of cellular proteins.We observed a significant accumulation of high mannose glycans, in particular Man 5 and 6, in cells treated with ICZ in comparison to untreated cells. Because Man 5 and 6 precede the addition of GlcNAc by GlcNAc transferase I, we speculate that ICZ may directly or indirectly influence the activity of this glycosyltransferase. However, we cannot discard the possibility that ICZ may affect the transport of UDP-GlcNAc across the Golgi membrane or mannosidase II activity. Changes in calcium levels may also be responsible for the effect of ICZ on glycan processing. ICZ has been shown to directly inhibit 5′-lipoxygenase, blocking the production of leukotriene B4, and subsequently interfering with store-operated uptake of calcium by activated neutrophils (26Steel H.C. Tintinger G.R. Theron A.J. Anderson R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2007; 150: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Calcium has been demonstrated to be required for optimal processing of glycoproteins by the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas depletion of manganese inhibits O-linked and N-linked protein glycosylation in mammalian cells (27Dürr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 28Kaufman R.J. Swaroop M. Murtha-Riel P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9813-9819Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Kuznetsov G. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2001-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the precise site of ICZ action responsible for the alteration of glycoprotein processing remains to be elucidated.In addition to altered glycosylation, we also found that CD14 expression was increased on both the mRNA and protein levels in the presence of ICZ. This increase in CD14 expression was correlated with an elevation of TNF-α production at low LPS concentrations, which are specific for CD14-dependent macrophage activation. Lack of polylactosamine, a complex N- and O-glycan modification, in β3GnT2-deficient mice resulted in peritoneal macrophages with higher CD14 expression and enhanced responses to LPS. Polylactosamine was not detected on receptors for LPS, including CD14, by lectin microarrays (17Togayachi A. Kozono Y. Ishida H. Abe S. Suzuki N. Tsunoda Y. Hagiwara K. Kuno A. Ohkura T. Sato N. Sato T. Hirabayashi J. Ikehara Y. Tachibana K. Narimatsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15829-15834Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that lack of polylactosamine on some other macrophage protein(s) results in up-regulation of CD14 expression. This is a possible explanation for the increased expression of CD14 observed following ICZ treatment of RAW 264.7 Mϕs, because ICZ should also deplete polylactosamine.Although ICZ is extensively used with great safety, a small risk of liver and congestive heart failure has been observed. However, this situation could change with the prolonged use of this drug or in the case of immunocompromised patients, such as patients receiving organ transplants or suffering from AIDS. In fact, a common cause of death in immunocompromised patients is invasive aspergillosis (30Marques S.A. Hozumi S. Camargo R.M. Carvalho M.F. Marques M.E. Med. Mycol. 2008; 46: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Treatment with azoles, such as ICZ for this condition, could be potentially harmful. Thus, prolonged treatment with ICZ could result in a dramatic alteration of surface glycoprotein patterns, which is likely to affect cellular function, homeostasis, and the immune response. Consequently, the long-term effect of ICZ on the immune system should be investigated.

The absence of fucosyltransferase (FucT-VII) resulted in defects in selectin-mediated T-cell trafficking (15Malý P. Thall A. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. von Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 643-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Alterations in N-linked glycosylation have also been linked to alterations in the immune response, in particular with autoimmunity. Ablation of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (Mgat5) results in a lack of candidate structures for polylactosamine and increased T-cell receptor signaling due to enhanced T-cell receptor clustering (16Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), resulting in autoimmune disease. It was recently demonstrated that lack of polylactosamine (a fundamental structure in both N- and O-glycans) in β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (β3GnT2)-deficient mice resulted in increased T-cell activation, hyperproliferation upon B-cell receptor stimulation, and enhanced activation of macrophages in response to endotoxin (17Togayachi A. Kozono Y. Ishida H. Abe S. Suzuki N. Tsunoda Y. Hagiwara K. Kuno A. Ohkura T. Sato N. Sato T. Hirabayashi J. Ikehara Y. Tachibana K. Narimatsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15829-15834Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Finally, a dramatic remodeling of N-glycans on the surface of CD4 and CD8 T-cells has been demonstrated following activation of these cells, which is due to alterations in the expression of key glycosyltransferases (18Comelli E.M. Sutton-Smith M. Yan Q. Amado M. Panico M. Gilmartin T. Whisenant T. Lanigan C.M. Head S.R. Goldberg D. Morris H.R. Dell A. Paulson J.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in α-mannosidase II, which displays reduced expression of complex N-glycans, develop autoimmune disease similar to human systemic lupus erythematosus (19Chui D. Sellakumar G. Green R. Sutton-Smith M. McQuistan T. Marek K. Morris H. Dell A. Marth J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This effect has recently been attributed to the presence of immune stimulatory mannose ligands for innate immune lectin receptors (20Green R.S. Stone E.L. Tenno M. Lehtonen E. Farquhar M.G. Marth J.D. Immunity. 2007; 27: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We showed that ICZ, at clinically relevant concentrations (21Kageyama S. Masuya M. Tanaka I. Oka K. Morita K. Tamaki S. Tsuji K. Katayama N. Sugimoto H. Kagawa Y. Kojima M. Shiku H. J. Infect. Chemother. 1999; 5: 213-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), resulted in a change of surface glycoproteins from complex to high mannose. Thus, it is possible that prolonged treatment with this drug may also result in the occurrence of autoimmune disease in patients.The effect of ICZ on glycosylation could not be correlated with a decrease in cellular cholesterol levels, because reduction of this sterol by treatment with NB-598 or incubation in lipoprotein-deficient serum did not affect glycoprotein processing. Moreover, the increase in high mannose glycans was not the product of lanosterol build-up, secondary to inhibition 14α-demethylase, as demonstrated by coincubation of ICZ with either lovastatin or NB-598, which are inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and squalene epoxidase, respectively. Treatment with other azoles, such as ketoconazole or econazole, did not alter glycosylation processing, suggesting that the effect of ICZ is not due to the inhibition of another CYP450 enzyme, such as epoxygenase (22Roman R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 131-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the effect of ICZ on glycosylation is distinctive and independent of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.ICZ has been shown to have unique effects on other systems as well. ICZ, but not ketoconazole, was found to demonstrate synergy with resident peritoneal murine macrophages in killing Blastomyces dermatitidis (23Brummer E. Bhagavathula P.R. Hanson L.H. Stevens D.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 2487-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ICZ and its derivative hydroxyitraconazole, but not econazole, fluconazole, miconazole, or ketoconazole were also shown to induce morphological changes in macrophages as determined by light and scanning electron microscopy (24Ochi H. Ishijima S.A. Abe S. Tameike A. Yamaguchi H. Osumi M. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1998; 20: 181-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, ICZ has recently been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in human endothelial cells, an effect that was unique to ICZ among all the azoles tested (25Chong C.R. Xu J. Lu J. Bhat S. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Liu J.O. ACS Chem. Biol. 2007; 2: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is possible that these observed effects of ICZ may be due to its ability to alter glycosylation and therefore function of cellular proteins.We observed a significant accumulation of high mannose glycans, in particular Man 5 and 6, in cells treated with ICZ in comparison to untreated cells. Because Man 5 and 6 precede the addition of GlcNAc by GlcNAc transferase I, we speculate that ICZ may directly or indirectly influence the activity of this glycosyltransferase. However, we cannot discard the possibility that ICZ may affect the transport of UDP-GlcNAc across the Golgi membrane or mannosidase II activity. Changes in calcium levels may also be responsible for the effect of ICZ on glycan processing. ICZ has been shown to directly inhibit 5′-lipoxygenase, blocking the production of leukotriene B4, and subsequently interfering with store-operated uptake of calcium by activated neutrophils (26Steel H.C. Tintinger G.R. Theron A.J. Anderson R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2007; 150: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Calcium has been demonstrated to be required for optimal processing of glycoproteins by the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas depletion of manganese inhibits O-linked and N-linked protein glycosylation in mammalian cells (27Dürr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 28Kaufman R.J. Swaroop M. Murtha-Riel P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9813-9819Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Kuznetsov G. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2001-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the precise site of ICZ action responsible for the alteration of glycoprotein processing remains to be elucidated.In addition to altered glycosylation, we also found that CD14 expression was increased on both the mRNA and protein levels in the presence of ICZ. This increase in CD14 expression was correlated with an elevation of TNF-α production at low LPS concentrations, which are specific for CD14-dependent macrophage activation. Lack of polylactosamine, a complex N- and O-glycan modification, in β3GnT2-deficient mice resulted in peritoneal macrophages with higher CD14 expression and enhanced responses to LPS. Polylactosamine was not detected on receptors for LPS, including CD14, by lectin microarrays (17Togayachi A. Kozono Y. Ishida H. Abe S. Suzuki N. Tsunoda Y. Hagiwara K. Kuno A. Ohkura T. Sato N. Sato T. Hirabayashi J. Ikehara Y. Tachibana K. Narimatsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15829-15834Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that lack of polylactosamine on some other macrophage protein(s) results in up-regulation of CD14 expression. This is a possible explanation for the increased expression of CD14 observed following ICZ treatment of RAW 264.7 Mϕs, because ICZ should also deplete polylactosamine.Although ICZ is extensively used with great safety, a small risk of liver and congestive heart failure has been observed. However, this situation could change with the prolonged use of this drug or in the case of immunocompromised patients, such as patients receiving organ transplants or suffering from AIDS. In fact, a common cause of death in immunocompromised patients is invasive aspergillosis (30Marques S.A. Hozumi S. Camargo R.M. Carvalho M.F. Marques M.E. Med. Mycol. 2008; 46: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Treatment with azoles, such as ICZ for this condition, could be potentially harmful. Thus, prolonged treatment with ICZ could result in a dramatic alteration of surface glycoprotein patterns, which is likely to affect cellular function, homeostasis, and the immune response. Consequently, the long-term effect of ICZ on the immune system should be investigated. ICZ is an azole antifungal agent widely used in humans. Although this drug has a broad spectrum of activity, it is particularly useful in the treatment of Aspergillus (11Zonios D.I. Bennett J.E. Semin. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2008; 29: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). ICZ inhibits fungal CYP450 oxidase-mediated synthesis of ergosterol, resulting in cell growth arrest. In mammals, ICZ is an inhibitor of the CYP450 enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase, which is involved in the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol. In the present study, we found that treatment of murine Mϕs with ICZ at pharmacological doses resulted in a dramatic alteration in the processing of newly synthesized N-linked oligosaccharides. Thus, treatment with ICZ resulted in an increase in high mannose structures. The preponderance of high mannose glycans and lack of conversion into complex structures was demonstrated by sensitivity to endo H digestion of newly synthesized glycoproteins after incorporation of [2-3H]mannose in cells treated with ICZ. In addition, the levels of high mannose glycan were elevated in cells treated with ICZ in comparison with control cells. Moreover, cells treated with ICZ displayed an elevated content of high mannose glycoconjugates on the surface as demonstrated by ConA binding. Surface glycoconjugates have been shown to play critical roles in the immune response, in particular during T-cell differentiation (12Lowe J.B. Cell. 2001; 104: 809-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in the pattern of cell surface glycoproteins have been observed during the maturation of thymocytes (13De Maio A. Lis H. Gershoni J.M. Sharon N. Cell. Immunol. 1986; 99: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Naïve (immature) CD8+ cortical thymocytes, which typically undergo an addition of sialic acid to the O-linked glycan Galβ1–3GalNacαThr/Ser during maturation, showed an enhancement of apoptosis, resulting in a reduction in their population in sialyltransferase (ST3Gal-I/ST3Gal-I)-null mice (14Priatel J.J.

https://openalex.org/W1967487222,"Nutrient over-enrichment of the Baltic Sea, accompanied by intensified algal blooms and decreasing water clarity, has aroused widespread concern in the surrounding countries during the last four decades. This work has used a well-tested dynamic mass-balance model to investigate which decrease in total phosphorus loading would be required to meet the environmental goal to restore the trophic state in the Baltic Sea to pre-1960s levels. Furthermore, the extent to which various abatement options may decrease the phosphorus loading in a cost-effective manner has been studied. Upgrading urban sewage treatment in the catchment could, alone or in combination with banning phosphates in detergents, be sufficient to meet the set environmental goal, at an estimated annual basin-wide cost of 0.21–0.43 billion euro. Such a plan would potentially decrease the total phosphorus loading to the Baltic Sea with 6,650–10,200 tonnes per year."
https://openalex.org/W1966150463,"Background The NBN gene codes for the protein nibrin, which is involved in the detection and repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). The NBN gene is essential in mammals. Methodology/Principal Findings We have used a conditional null mutant mouse model in a proteomics approach to identify proteins with modified expression levels after 4 Gy ionizing irradiation in the absence of nibrin in vivo. Altogether, amongst ∼8,000 resolved proteins, 209 were differentially expressed in homozygous null mutant mice in comparison to control animals. One group of proteins significantly altered in null mutant mice were those involved in oxidative stress and cellular redox homeostasis (p<0.0001). In substantiation of this finding, analysis of Nbn null mutant fibroblasts indicated an increased production of reactive oxygen species following induction of DSBs. Conclusions/Significance In humans, biallelic hypomorphic mutations in NBN lead to Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), an autosomal recessive genetic disease characterised by extreme radiosensitivity coupled with growth retardation, immunoinsufficiency and a very high risk of malignancy. This particularly high cancer risk in NBS may be attributable to the compound effect of a DSB repair defect and oxidative stress."

In light of recent European Union moves to limit high-field exposure for those working with MRI scanners, we have evaluated the potential for detrimental cellular effects via nanomagnetic actuation of endogenous iron oxides in the body. Methodology Theoretical models and experimental data on the composition and magnetic properties of endogenous iron oxides in human tissue were used to analyze the forces on iron oxide particles.

https://openalex.org/W1996281086,"Non-histone protein acylation is increasingly recognized as an important posttranslational modification, but little is known as to the biochemical properties of protein serine acylating enzymes.We here report that we have identified a metal-stimulated serine octanoyltransferase activity in microsomes from human erythroleukemic (HEL) cells. The HEL acylating enzyme was linear with respect to time and protein, exhibited a neutral pH optimum (stimulated by cobalt and zinc), and inhibited by chelating reagents. Hydroxylamine treatment removed most, but not all, of the attached radioactivity. A salt extract of microsomal membranes contained the major portion of enzyme activity, indicating that this acyltransferase is not an integral membrane protein. Sucrose density fractionation showed that the acyltransferase activity is concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum. In competition experiments, the acyltransferase was well inhibited by activated forms of fatty acids containing at least eight to fourteen carbons, but not by acetyl CoA. The zinc-stimulated HEL acyltransferase did not octanoylate proenkephalin, proopiomelanocortin, His-tagged proghrelin, or proghrelin lacking the amino-terminal His-tag stub of Gly-Ala-Met. The peptides des-acyl ghrelin and ACTH were also not acylated; however, des-acyl ghrelin containing the N-terminal tripeptide Gly-Ala-Met was acylated. Mutagenesis studies indicated a requirement for serine five residues from the amino terminus, reminiscent of myristoyl transferase, but not of ghrelin acylation. However, recombinant myristoyl transferase could not recapitulate the hydroxylamine sensitivity, zinc-stimulation, nor EDTA inhibition obtained with HEL acyltransferase, properties preserved in the HEL cell enzyme purified through four sequential chromatographic steps.In conclusion, our data demonstrate the presence of a zinc-stimulated acyltransferase activity concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum in HEL cells which is likely to contribute to medium-chain protein lipidation."
