https://openalex.org/W2003380041,"We have compared activation by heat of TRPV4 channels, heterogeneously expressed in HEK293 cells, and endogenous channels in mouse aorta endothelium (MAEC). Increasing the temperature above 25 °C activated currents and increased [Ca2+]i in HEK293 cells transfected with TRPV4 and in MAEC. When compared with activation of TRPV4 currents by the selective ligand 4αPDD (α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate), heat-activated currents in both systems showed the typical biophysical properties of currents through TRPV4, including their single channel conductance. Deletion of the three N-terminal ankyrin binding domains of TRPV4 abolished current activation cells by heat in HEK293. In inside-out patches, TRPV4 could not be activated by heat but still responded to the ligand 4αPDD. In MAEC, the same channel is activated under identical conditions as in the HEK expression system. Our data indicate that TRPV4 is a functional temperature-sensing channel in native endothelium, that is likely involved in temperature-dependent Ca2+ signaling. The failure to activate TRPV4 channels by heat in inside-out patches, which responded to 4αPDD, may indicate that heat activation depends on the presence of an endogenous ligand, which is missing in inside-out patches.

Sensing of temperature in the body and the environment is one of the most essential mechanisms for controlling the homeostasis of several regulatory pathways in the mammalian body (1Viana F. de la Pena E. Belmonte C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 254-260Google Scholar). In recent years, unraveling of thermosensing mechanisms has been very successful, because at least four members of the TRPV subfamily of transient receptor potential cation channels, TRPV 1The abbreviations used are: TRPV, transient receptor potential vanilloid; MAEC, mouse aorta endothelial cells; HEK, human embryonic kidney; 4αPDD, α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate; ANK, ankyrin; I-V, current-voltage 1The abbreviations used are: TRPV, transient receptor potential vanilloid; MAEC, mouse aorta endothelial cells; HEK, human embryonic kidney; 4αPDD, α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate; ANK, ankyrin; I-V, current-voltage 1, -2, -3, and -4 and a more distantly related protein TRPM8 have been identified (for a unified nomenclature see Refs. 2Clapham D.E.

Julius D. Kojima I. Mori Y. Penner R. Prawitt D. Scharenberg A.M. Schultz G. Shimizu S. Zhu M.X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 229-231Google Scholar) as sensors of temperature. Proteins of this subfamily typically contain 3–6 ankyrin repeats in the N terminus, and six transmembrane segments with a pore region between segments 5 and 6. The first identified non-mammalian member of this subfamily, the Caenorhabditis elegans OSM-9 channel, is activated by changes in osmolarity (4Colbert H.A. Smith T.L. Bargmann C.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8259-8269Google Scholar). The second protein of the TRPV family that has been identified is the mammalian vanilloid receptor channel VR1 (TRPV1), which is activated by vanilloid compounds such as capsaicin, pepper, hot chili, moderate heat, or protons (5Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Google Scholar). Unlike TRPV1, another close relative of this channel, TRPV2, is constitutively activated by growth factors (6Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Li L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Google Scholar) or by noxious heat (7Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Google Scholar). TRPV1 and TRPV2 are activated by temperatures above 43 and 52 °C, respectively (5Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Google Scholar,7Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Google Scholar). Currents through TRPV3 exponentially increase at temperatures above 35 °C (8Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Moqrich A. Earley T.J. Hergarden A.C. Story G.M. Colley S. Hogenesch J.B. McIntyre P.

DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 181-186Google Scholar). It has also been shown in current measurements on oocytes and by cytoplasmic Ca2+([Ca2+]i) measurements in HEK cells that TRPV4 is activated in both expression systems at temperature above 30 °C (11Güler A. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Google Scholar). TRPM8 is activated by temperatures below 22 °C and is therefore a candidate for cold reception (12McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Google Scholar, 13Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Cell. 2002; 108: 705-715Google Scholar).So far, the molecular mechanism of channel activation by heat for any of these channels is not known, and functional measurements of heat-activated channels in native tissue have only been performed for TRPV1. We have studied in the present report activation by heat of TRPV4 (also known as OTRPC4, VR-OAC, or TRP12), which was originally thought to be a channel sensing changes in cell volume (14Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Google Scholar, 15Nilius B. Prenen J. Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Droogmans G.

This activation caused an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i. We show here that TRPV4 channels are activated by heat above a threshold temperature of 25 °C. Activation requires the intact N-terminal ankyrin repeats. Single TRPV4 channels can be activated by heat in cell-attached patches but not in cell-free inside-out patches. Interestingly, as shown by Northern blot analysis, TRPV4 is highly expressed in endothelial cells from mouse aorta (14Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Google Scholar). We show here for the first time in a native cell that heat activates a channel in mouse aorta endothelial cells with identical properties as the heterologously expressed channel.DISCUSSIONTRPV4, a member of the family of vanilloid receptor channels, is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, including heart, brain, endothelium, kidney, sensory neurons, sympathetic nerves, fat tissue, gut, salivary gland, lung, skin, sweat glands, the inner ear, and keratinocytes (11Güler A. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Google Scholar, 14Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V.

Originally, these channels were considered as Ca2+-permeable sensors of cell volume, because they can be activated by cell swelling (14Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Google Scholar, 15Nilius B. Prenen J. Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Droogmans G. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 443: 227-233Google Scholar, 16Liedtke W. Choe Y.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation by cell swelling is not known; however, we have hypothesized that cell swelling may produce an endogenous ligand that in turn activates the channel (21Watanabe H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. Cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Benham C.D. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Google Scholar). The existence of such a ligand is very likely because several members of the TRPV family are agonist-gated channels, which are opened by binding of capsaicin and related compounds (5Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Google Scholar, 24Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 159-212Google Scholar, 25Smart D.

Cho S. Min K.H. Suh Y.G. Kim D. Oh U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6155-6160Google Scholar), and we have also shown that TRPV4 can be activated by the phorbol ester 4αPDD (21Watanabe H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. Cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Benham C.D. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Google Scholar). Very recently, data from the Caterina and co-workers (11Güler A. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Google Scholar) laboratory have shown that TRPV4 can also be activated by heat. We show here that the currents activated by heat and 4αPDD are indeed identical. In addition, we present novel data, which might indicate that TRPV4 cannot be activated in cell-free inside-out patches and is present as a channel activated by heat in native endothelial cells.Are 4αPDD and Heat-activated Currents Identical?4αPDD-activated currents through TRPV4 channels show the following hallmarks (21Watanabe H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. Cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Benham C.D. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Google Scholar, 27Voets T. Prenen J. Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33704-33710Google Scholar): 1) a current-voltage relationship with inward and outward rectification over a wide voltage range and outward rectification between −100 and +100 mV, 2) a reversal potential between 14 and 20 mV in 150 mm Na+- and 5.0 mm Ca2+-containing extracellular solutions, 3) Ca2+ permeates the channel, 4) voltage-dependent block by ruthenium red, 5) rapid inactivation of the current during prolonged stimulation, and 6) desensitization following repetitive stimulation. Currents with almost identical features were observed in heat-activated TRPV4 expressing HEK293 cells, but were absent in non-transfected cells. In addition, the conductance of the single channels activated by 4αPDD and heat are nearly identical, i.e. ∼60 and 100 pS for inward and outward currents, respectively. These values are in agreement with those of TRPV4 channels activated by cell swelling (17Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Google Scholar). A heat-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i dependent on extracellular Ca2+ is consistent with Ca2+permeation through these channels. We have also identified a similar current in isolated endothelial cells from mouse aorta, which endogenously express TRPV4.Temperature Range of TRPV4 ActivationIn our TRPV4 expression system, we have observed current that increases exponentially at temperatures above 25 °C. The Q10 value of this heat sensitive current above this threshold was about 19 compared with a subthreshold value of 1.5. This value suggests somewhat higher temperature sensitivity than that of TRPV3, as shown in a recent report (8Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Moqrich A. Earley T.J. Hergarden A.C. Story G.M. Colley S. Hogenesch J.B. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Science. 2002; 296: 2046-2049Google Scholar). We did not observe current saturation at temperatures up to 43 °C. Because heat activates only a fraction of the channels that can be activated by 4αPDD, the recruitment of channels by temperature might be less efficient than by the phorbol derivative. Compared with other temperature sensitive channels of the TRPV family, TRPV1, -2, -3 (5Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Google Scholar, 7Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Google Scholar, 8Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Moqrich A.

Moran M.M. Chong J.A. Lawson D. Ge P. Lilly J. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 181-186Google Scholar), TRPV4 channel activation occurs in a physiological temperature range, and they are already activated at normal body temperature. This is a surprising result and may indicate that these channels may serve as constitutively open Ca2+ entry channels sensitive to a small rise or fall in temperature.Mechanisms of TRPV4 Activation by HeatSo far, the mechanism(s) by which channels respond to heat has not been identified. A conformational change seems to be likely, but a heat dependent production of a messenger that activates TRPV4 cannot be excluded. It has been shown that an N-terminal splice variant of TRPV1 does not respond to capsaicin and heat (28Schumacher M.A. Moff I. Sudanagunta S.P. Levine J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2756-2762Google Scholar). We have therefore studied heat responses of a deletion mutant. Heat was unable to activate a current and to increase [Ca2+]i in the ankyrin-deletion mutant. Liedtke et al. (16Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Google Scholar) showed that deletion of the ankyrin binding repeats in TRPV4 channels does not prevent activation by cell swelling, i.e. the channels are still functional. In addition, the truncated channels are inserted in the plasma membrane as shown by confocal microscopy. Therefore, the lack of response to heat points to a defective channel rather than to defective trafficking of the channel to the surface membrane. We hypothesize that the ankyrin repeats are necessary to stabilize a channel conformation, which is permissive for activation by heat.Interestingly, 4αPDD can activate TRPV4 channels in both the cell-free and cell-attached patch clamp configuration indicating that: 1) the ligand probably reaches the channel from the inside and 2) the channel is still functional in cell-free patches. However, heat only activates channels in the cell-attached mode. We failed to see any activation in cell-free inside-out patches. These data might indicate that heat produces a ligand rather than activating the channel directly or enhances activation by a diffusible ligand that is already present. This is in contrast to TRPV1 channels where clear single channel activity in response to heat activation can be recorded in inside-out patches (29Tominaga M. Caterina M. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilbert H. Skinner K. Raumann B.E. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 531-543Google Scholar).Recently, several reports have indicated that repetitive activation of TRPV channels by heat resulted in a decreased or even an increased response. However, data are variable, and there is little agreement on how current amplitude and threshold temperature change with repetitive heat challenges. Sensitization has been observed in TRPV1, -2, -3 heterologously expressed in CHO cells or in Xenopus oocytes (7Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Google Scholar, 8Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Moqrich A. Earley T.J. Hergarden A.C. Story G.M. Colley S. Hogenesch J.B. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Science. 2002; 296: 2046-2049Google Scholar, 10Xu H. Ramsey I.S. Kotecha S.A. Moran M.M. Chong J.A. Lawson D. Ge P. Lilly J. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 181-186Google Scholar, 22Jordt S.E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Google Scholar). On the other hand, the studies using primary sensory neurones (30Vyklicky L. Vlachova V. Vitaskova Z. Dittert I. Kabat M. Orkaand R.K. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 181-192Google Scholar, 31Schwarz S. Greffrath W. Busselberg D. Treede R.D. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 539-549Google Scholar) have reported desensitization of heat-evoked currents. Interestingly, Tominaga et al. (29Tominaga M. Caterina M. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilbert H. Skinner K. Raumann B.E. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 531-543Google Scholar) showed sensitization in TRPV1-expressing Xenopus oocytes but desensitization in HEK293 transfected with the same channel. These observations that accessory proteins or differences in the signaling pathways in the host cell might contribute to both the sensitization and desensitization mechanisms. In TRPV4-expressing HEK293 cells, we showed a diminished response to a subsequent heat application. This mechanism is mediated by a process, which is activated during the first response and continued for at least 4 min. However, the mechanism underlying this desensitization is still obscure.Is There Any Physiological Significance of TRPV4 Activation by Heat?Reminiscent of TRPV1, TRPV4 shows some unexpected gating promiscuity: it can be activated by cell swelling, by a ligand, and by heat. However, it is possible that all mechanisms refer to the same mode of activation, namely the production of an endogenous ligand. Such a mechanism has been discussed elsewhere (21Watanabe H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. Cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Benham C.D. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Google Scholar). Cell swelling may activate PLA2 thereby producing arachidonic acid or a downstream metabolite as a possible ligand (32Hoffmann E.K. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 273-288Google Scholar, 33Hoffmann E.K. Dunham P.B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 161: 173-262Google Scholar, 34Basavappa S. Pedersen S.F. Jorgensen N.K. Ellory J.C. Hoffmann E.K. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1441-1449Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recorded channel activation by arachidonic acid. 2H. Watanabe and B. Nilius, unpublished results. Because heat does not evoke channel activity in inside-out patches, a likely explanation might be the loss of the metabolic pathway responsible for activation of a possible messenger. In this view, the promiscuous gating behavior of TRPV4 might be explained by a ligand-dependent gating. Whatever the precise mechanism of activation might be, the high Q10 value demonstrates that this system is acting as a very efficient thermosensor rather than reflecting the normal temperature sensitivity of biological reactions.The temperature dependence of TRPV4 is, at least in this range, an unexpected result. It must be concluded that constitutive open Ca2+ channels exist in cells expressing TRPV4. Such cells should have an elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentration. So far, the physiological significance of this thermosensitive property of TRPV channels has been linked to primary nociceptive neurons. We have shown here in addition that TRPV4 plays a central role in temperature dependent Ca2+ homeostasis in endothelium. We observed indeed that [Ca2+]i was elevated at 37 °C in mouse aorta endothelial cells, which express TRPV4. Such an elevation could have important consequences,e.g. for a steady state production of nitric oxide. Cooling of peripheral blood vessels could therefore induce vasoconstriction andvice versa warming up, vasodilatation (35Minson C.T. Berry L.T. Joyner M.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1619-1626Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that TRPV4 could work as both a cold and a warm receptor. In addition, endothelial the temperature sensitivity of TRPV4 may suggest a role in mediating inflammatory pathophysiology in fever,e.g. by changing barrier properties that depend on Ca2+ influx (36Tiruppathi C. Freichel M. Vogel S.M. Paria B.C. Mehta D. Flockerzi V. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 70-76Google Scholar).In general, the existence of a constitutive open Ca2+ entry pathway might be important to boost Ca2+ signaling by changes in membrane potential, lower the threshold for effects evoked by activation of another Ca2+ entry pathway, or by intracellular Ca2+ release and might therefore function as a Ca2+ amplifier in several issues. Interestingly, TRPV4 channels are also inactivated by elevation of [Ca2+]i and are desensitized due to prolonged or consecutive stimulation. We have recently reported that the IC50 for intracellular inhibition of TRPV4 by [Ca2+]i is 406 nm. Such a mechanism would prevent Ca2+ overload by TRPV4 and might be efficiently involved in fine-tuning the Ca2+influx via TRPV4.In conclusion, we show here that the Ca2+ entry channel TRPV4 can be gated by heat in a temperature range between 25 and 43 °C. This is an additional mechanism for activation of a Ca2+ entry pathway. It is, however, not unlikely that the diverse modes of channel activation may converge to a common mechanism, namely binding of a still elusive endogenous ligand. Sensing of temperature in the body and the environment is one of the most essential mechanisms for controlling the homeostasis of several regulatory pathways in the mammalian body (1Viana F. de la Pena E. Belmonte C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 254-260Google Scholar). In recent years, unraveling of thermosensing mechanisms has been very successful, because at least four members of the TRPV subfamily of transient receptor potential cation channels, TRPV 1The abbreviations used are: TRPV, transient receptor potential vanilloid; MAEC, mouse aorta endothelial cells; HEK, human embryonic kidney; 4αPDD, α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate; ANK, ankyrin; I-V, current-voltage 1The abbreviations used are: TRPV, transient receptor potential vanilloid; MAEC, mouse aorta endothelial cells; HEK, human embryonic kidney; 4αPDD, α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate; ANK, ankyrin; I-V, current-voltage 1, -2, -3, and -4 and a more distantly related protein TRPM8 have been identified (for a unified nomenclature see Refs. 2Clapham D.E.

Proteins of this subfamily typically contain 3–6 ankyrin repeats in the N terminus, and six transmembrane segments with a pore region between segments 5 and 6. The first identified non-mammalian member of this subfamily, the Caenorhabditis elegans OSM-9 channel, is activated by changes in osmolarity (4Colbert H.A. Smith T.L. Bargmann C.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8259-8269Google Scholar). The second protein of the TRPV family that has been identified is the mammalian vanilloid receptor channel VR1 (TRPV1), which is activated by vanilloid compounds such as capsaicin, pepper, hot chili, moderate heat, or protons (5Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Google Scholar). Unlike TRPV1, another close relative of this channel, TRPV2, is constitutively activated by growth factors (6Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Li L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Google Scholar) or by noxious heat (7Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Google Scholar). TRPV1 and TRPV2 are activated by temperatures above 43 and 52 °C, respectively (5Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Google Scholar,7Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Google Scholar). Currents through TRPV3 exponentially increase at temperatures above 35 °C (8Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Moqrich A. Earley T.J. Hergarden A.C. Story G.M. Colley S. Hogenesch J.B. McIntyre P.

DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 181-186Google Scholar). It has also been shown in current measurements on oocytes and by cytoplasmic Ca2+([Ca2+]i) measurements in HEK cells that TRPV4 is activated in both expression systems at temperature above 30 °C (11Güler A. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Google Scholar). TRPM8 is activated by temperatures below 22 °C and is therefore a candidate for cold reception (12McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Google Scholar, 13Peier A.M. Moqrich A.

So far, the molecular mechanism of channel activation by heat for any of these channels is not known, and functional measurements of heat-activated channels in native tissue have only been performed for TRPV1. We have studied in the present report activation by heat of TRPV4 (also known as OTRPC4, VR-OAC, or TRP12), which was originally thought to be a channel sensing changes in cell volume (14Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Google Scholar, 15Nilius B. Prenen J. Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Droogmans G.

This activation caused an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i. We show here that TRPV4 channels are activated by heat above a threshold temperature of 25 °C. Activation requires the intact N-terminal ankyrin repeats. Single TRPV4 channels can be activated by heat in cell-attached patches but not in cell-free inside-out patches. Interestingly, as shown by Northern blot analysis, TRPV4 is highly expressed in endothelial cells from mouse aorta (14Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Google Scholar). We show here for the first time in a native cell that heat activates a channel in mouse aorta endothelial cells with identical properties as the heterologously expressed channel. DISCUSSIONTRPV4, a member of the family of vanilloid receptor channels, is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, including heart, brain, endothelium, kidney, sensory neurons, sympathetic nerves, fat tissue, gut, salivary gland, lung, skin, sweat glands, the inner ear, and keratinocytes (11Güler A.

LPA is thought to be produced during serum formation based on the fact that the LPA level is much higher in serum than in plasma. In this study, to better understand the pathways of LPA synthesis in serum, we evaluated the roles of platelets, plasma, and phospholipases by measuring LPA using a novel enzyme-linked fluorometric assay. First, examination of platelet-depleted rats showed that half of the LPA in serum is produced via a platelet-dependent pathway. However, the amount of LPA released from isolated platelets after they are activated by thrombin or calcium ionophore accounted for only a small part of serum LPA. Most of the platelet-derived LPA was produced in a two-step process: lysophospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and lysophosphatidylserine, were released from activated rat platelets by the actions of two phospholipases, group IIA secretory phospholipase A2(sPLA2-IIA) and phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1 (PS-PLA1), which were abundantly expressed in the cells. Then these lysophospholipids were converted to LPA by the action of plasma lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD). Second, accumulation of LPA in incubated plasma was strongly accelerated by the addition of recombinant lysoPLD with a concomitant decrease in LPC accumulation, indicating that the enzyme produces LPA by hydrolyzing LPC produced during the incubation. In addition, incubation of plasma isolated from human subjects who were deficient in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) did not result in increases of either LPC or LPA. The present study demonstrates multiple pathways for LPA production in serum and the involvement of several phospholipases, including PS-PLA1, sPLA2-IIA, LCAT, and lysoPLD.

Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 151-184Google Scholar, 2Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Google Scholar), including platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, cell proliferation, and cytoskeletal reorganization (e.g. generation of actin stress fibers and inhibition of neurite outgrowth). LPA evokes its multiple effects through G-protein-coupled receptors that are specific to LPA. Recent studies have identified a new family of receptor genes for LPA (reviewed in Refs. 3Chun J. Contos J.J. Munroe D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 213-242Google Scholar and 4Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Google Scholar). Members of this family include three G-protein-coupled receptors belonging to the EDG (endothelial cell differentiation gene) family, EDG2/LPA1 (5Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Google Scholar), EDG4/LPA2 (6An S. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7906-7910Google Scholar), and EDG7/LPA3 (7Bandoh K. Aoki J. Hosono H. Kobayashi S. Kobayashi T. Murakami M.K. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27776-27785Google Scholar), which are coupled with different G-proteins and may explain various cellular responses to LPA. Serum is known to contain micromolar concentrations of LPA, but the levels in plasma are much lower (8Tigyi G. Miledi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21360-21367Google Scholar). For this reason it has been proposed that LPA in serum is produced as a result of blood coagulation and that platelets are involved, in part, in the production of LPA in serum. In the literature, two pathways have been postulated for the extracellular production of LPA. In the first pathway, LPA is produced by activated platelets. Mauco et al. (9Mauco G. Chap H. Simon M.F. Douste B.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1978; 60: 653-661Google Scholar) showed that LPA is produced by human platelets after the cells were treated with exogenous phospholipase C from Clostridium welchii. LPA is also produced by platelets when they are activated by thrombin (10Gerrard J.M. Robinson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 282-285Google Scholar, 11Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Google Scholar). However, as discussed by Gaits et al. (12Gaits F. Fourcade O. Le B.F. Gueguen G. Gaige B. Gassama D.A. Fauvel J. Salles J.P. Mauco G. Simon M.F. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 54-58Google Scholar), the amount of LPA produced in the latter two studies is too low to explain the LPA level in serum. Thus, the full contribution of platelets to serum LPA production is currently unknown. In the second pathway, LPA is converted from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) by lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activity (1Tokumura A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 151-184Google Scholar), which may occur in aged plasma or incubated plasma. The contribution of this pathway to the production of serum LPA is unclear, because little is known about the enzymatic properties of lysoPLD. LPA in serum and produced in platelets is a mixture of various fatty acids. LPA species with both saturated fatty acids (16:0 and 18:0) and unsaturated fatty acids (16:1, 18:1, 18:2, and 20:4) have been detected in serum, plasma, and activated platelets (10Gerrard J.M. Robinson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 282-285Google Scholar, 13Xiao Y. Chen Y. Kennedy A.W. Belinson J. Xu Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 242-259Google Scholar, 14Baker D.L. Umstot E.S. Desiderio D.M. Tigyi G.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 267-269Google Scholar). Interestingly, these LPA species exhibit differential biological activities (15Tokumura A. Iimori M. Nishioka Y. Kitahara M. Sakashita M. Tanaka S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C204-C210Google Scholar, 16Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Mulder S. Postma F.R. Simon M.F.

Aoki J. Arai H. Sobue K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 251-258Google Scholar) by differentially activating three LPA receptors, EDG2, EDG4, and EDG7 (18Bandoh K. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 159-165Google Scholar). These observations suggest that LPA species are biologically significant and are produced by diverse synthetic pathways. Serum LPA can be produced from phospholipid precursors either in membranes of blood cells or in plasma by sequential actions of phospholipases present in plasma or expressed by blood cells. In rats, two PLAs, secretory phospholipase A2 group IIA (sPLA2-IIA) (19Komada M. Kudo I. Mizushima H. Kitamura N. Inoue K. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 545-547Google Scholar, 20Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 217-231Google Scholar) and phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1 (PS-PLA1) (21Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Google Scholar, 22Aoki J. Nagai Y. Hosono H. Inoue K. Arai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 26-32Google Scholar), are expressed predominantly in platelets (23Horigome K. Hayakawa M. Inoue K. Nojima S. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 53-61Google Scholar). We previously showed that these two PLAs are involved in agonist-induced production of lysophospholipids such as LPC, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), and lysophosphatidylserine (LPS) in activated platelets by analyzing the phospholipid composition using specific inhibitors of sPLA2-IIA (24Yokoyama K. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1280-1287Google Scholar). In addition, other phospholipases capable of producing lysophospholipids, possibly LPC, have been identified in plasma. Two such phospholipases are lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). It has been suggested that part of the LPC present in blood is attributed to the transesterification of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and free cholesterol catalyzed by LCAT (25Sekas G. Patton G.M. Lincoln E.C. Robins S.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1985; 105: 190-194Google Scholar). It is also possible that the plasma PAF-AH (26Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le T.H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Google Scholar) contributes to LPC production by hydrolyzing oxidized phosphatidylcholine (27Watson A.D. Navab M. Hama S.Y. Sevanian A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 774-782Google Scholar), which has been implicated in various pathological conditions. We have recently identified the above-mentioned lysoPLD by purifying the enzyme (28Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Google Scholar). The identification and cloning of these phospholipases make it possible to examine their contribution to serum LPA production. In this study, to elucidate the one or more synthetic pathways for LPA in serum, we attempted to clarify the roles of blood cells, plasma, and the phospholipases in serum LPA production. Rabbit anti-rat platelet serum was purchased from Inter-Cell Technologies Inc. Bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free, A-6003) was purchased from Sigma. 1-Oleoyl (18:1)-LPA, 1-oleoyl-LPC, 1-oleoyl-LPE, 1-oleoyl-LPS, porcine liver LPI, sphingosylphosphocholine, and dioleoyl-PC were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and 1-[3H]oleoyl-LPA (18:1) was from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Monoglyceride lipase (MGL), glycero-3-phosphate oxidase (G3PO), and phosphocholine phosphodiesterase (GPCP) were kindly donated by Dr. S. Imamura (Asahi Chemical Industry Co. Ltd.). Horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Toyobo (Tokyo, Japan). Other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Male Wistar rats (15 weeks old, 300–350 g) were purchased from Japan SLC. The rats were fed a standard rat chow until the time of the study. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture. For preparation of serum, the drawn blood samples were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min to allow blood coagulation, and the supernatant after centrifugation at 2300 × g for 20 min at 4 °C was used as “serum.” For plasma, blood was drawn in the presence of one-sixth volume of acid citrate dextrose (ACD, 3% citrate, 2.2% d-glucose, pH 6.0) and was immediately centrifuged at 2300 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as “plasma.” For preparation of platelet-depleted rats, anti-rat platelet serum (200 μl) was injected into the animals intravenously, and, after 6 h, serum was prepared as described above. Plasma samples from patients with familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) who were admitted to the Fukuoka Medical University Hospital were drawn as describe above. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Control plasma samples were drawn from healthy volunteers (22–45 years old). All blood samples were immediately stored at −80 °C to prevent additional formation of LPA. Blood was drawn from rats or human volunteers in the presence of one-sixth volume of ACD and was immediately centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. For platelet preparation, the supernatant (platelet-rich plasma) was further centrifuged at 2300 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting cell pellet was washed twice with buffer A (12 mmcitric acid, 15 mm sodium citrate, 113 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 12 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4) and finally suspended in buffer A. For erythrocyte preparation, the cells in the pellet fraction of the ACD blood were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice after the buffy coat was removed. White blood cells were isolated using density gradient (Nyco Prep 1.077 Animal (Daiichikagaku, Tokyo, Japan)) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The major cell populations were lymphocytes and monocytes. For experiments to examine LPA production by these cells, the cell numbers of erythrocytes, platelets, and white blood cells were adjusted to 650, 11, and 2.0 × 107 cells/ml, respectively, to match their normal concentration in blood. To evaluate LPA production in these cells, the cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Concentrations of LPA and LPC were determined by an enzyme-linked fluorometric method established in the present study. LPA concentration was determined by fluorometry of H2O2 using 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (7.5 mm, Dojin, Tokyo, Japan) as a peroxidase donor (29Tamaoku K. Ueno K. Akiura K. Ohkura Y. Chem. Pharmacol. Bull. 1982; 30: 2492-2497Google Scholar) generated by the reaction of LPA samples with 10 units/ml monoglyceride lipase (MGL, Asahi Chemical Industry Co. Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan) and 10 units/ml glycero-3-phosphate oxidase (G3PO, Asahi Chemical Industry Co. Ltd.) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.07 unit/ml peroxidase (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan), pH 7.4, in a total volume of 1500 μl. The fluorescence intensity of excitation at 320 nm/emission at 404 nm was measured with a fluorometer (Hitachi, Ibaraki), 5 min after mixing the samples. We detected LPA as low as 0.1 nmol and obtained linearity up to 10 nmol of LPA in this system. For determination of the LPA concentration in blood samples, LPA in samples (1 ml) was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (30Bligh E.C. Dyer W.F. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) under acidic conditions (by lowering the pH to 3.0 with 1n HCl) prior to the LPA quantification. Lipids in the aqueous phase were re-extracted and pooled with the previous organic phase. The extracted lipids were dried and dissolved in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The LPA content of this solution was quantified as described above. The recovery of lipids was monitored by the addition of trace amounts of 1-[3H]oleoyl-LPA to the samples. Based on recovery of 1-[3H]oleoyl-LPA, lipid recovery was always >95% under the above-described conditions. LPC concentration was determined by a similar method except that 10 units/ml phosphocholine phosphodiesterase (GPCP, Asahi Chemical Industry Co. Ltd.) was applied in the assay system. The concentrations of LPA were determined from a standard curve, after subtracting the tentative values obtained from the fluorescence intensities of the MGL (+)/G3PO (+) reaction from those of the MGL (−)/G3PO (+) reaction. Similarly, the concentration of LPC was determined from a standard curve, after subtracting the tentative values obtained from the MGL (+)/G3PO (+)/GPCP (+) reaction from those of the MGL (−)/G3PO (+)/GPCP (+) reaction. LysoPLD activity was assayed as described previously (28Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (1–50 μl) were incubated with 1 mm LPC (from egg) in the presence of 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.0), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 37 °C. The liberated choline was detected by an enzymatic photometric method using choline oxidase (Asahi Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), horseradish peroxidase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), and TOOS reagent (N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-3-methylaniline, Dojin, Tokyo, Japan) as a hydrogen donor. To examine lysoPLD activity against LPE, LPS, and LPI (each at 1 mm), the formation of LPA in the reaction mixture was determined as described above. The recombinant enzymes used in this study (PS-PLA1 and lysoPLD) were expressed by a baculovirus system as described previously (28Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Google Scholar, 31Hosono H. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Bandoh K. Ishida M. Taguchi R. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29664-29670Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were partially purified from the culture supernatant of Sf9 cells infected with each baculovirus using heparin and Mono Q column chromatography (21Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Google Scholar, 28Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Google Scholar) and were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline (−/−) before use. sPLA2-IIA was purified from cell supernatant of thrombin-activated rat platelets as described previously (28Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Google Scholar, 57). To evaluate the involvement of platelets in the production of serum LPA, we prepared platelet-depleted animals and determined their serum LPA level by a fluorometric method established in this study (see “Experimental Procedures”). The number of platelets in rats treated with rabbit anti-platelet serum was about 1% of that in control animals treated with control rabbit serum (Fig. 1B). The treatment with rabbit anti-platelet serum did not affect the numbers of other blood cells such as erythrocytes and white blood cells (data not shown). Under these conditions, serum LPA levels were 0.94 ± 0.11 μm in anti-platelet-treated animals and 1.95 ± 0.14 μm in control antibody-treated animals (Fig. 1A). Plasma LPA levels in these animals were 0.17 ± 0.02 μm (platelet-depleted) and 0.16 ± 0.02 μm (control). These results confirmed a previous report that the LPA level is high in serum but low in plasma (8Tigyi G. Miledi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21360-21367Google Scholar). In addition, the present result shows that half of LPA in serum is produced by a platelet-dependent pathway. We next examined the contribution of platelets themselves to the production of LPA in serum by measuring the LPA produced by isolated platelets upon their activation. As shown in Fig. 1C, rat platelets produced and released LPA after they were activated by thrombin or by a calcium ionophore, A23187. However, the levels of LPA produced by these activators (0.10 ± 0.02 and 0.16 ± 0.01 μm, respectively) were too low to account for the LPA produced by the platelet-dependent pathway of LPA production in serum. The human platelets were also found to have a low ability to produce LPA upon activation (Fig. 2B). In view of the findings that much of the lysophospholipids, but not LPA, is produced in activated platelets (24Yokoyama K. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1280-1287Google Scholar) and that lysoPLD activity is detected in plasma of several mammalian species, including rat and human (28Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Google Scholar, 32Tokumura A. Harada K. Fukuzawa K. Tsukatani H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 31-38Google Scholar), we hypothesized that part of the LPA in serum is produced in two steps: generation of lysophospholipids in activated platelets and their subsequent conversion to LPA by lysoPLD. To test this possibility, we examined whether the full amount of LPA produced in the platelet-dependent pathway is detected when isolated platelets are activated in the presence of lysoPLD. As was observed previously (24Yokoyama K. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1280-1287Google Scholar), a high concentration of LPC was detected in the supernatant of activated platelets stimulated with thrombin or A23187(Fig. 2C). The addition of a physiological concentration of recombinant lysoPLD dramatically increased the amount of LPA in the supernatant of the activated rat or human platelets and slightly decreased the LPC level (Fig. 2B). In the presence of recombinant lysoPLD, the concentration of LPA rose to 0.63 ± 0.09 μm and 0.73 ± 0.12 μm when isolated rat platelets were activated by thrombin and A23187, respectively (Fig. 2B). These concentrations are comparable to the concentration produced in the platelet-dependent pathway (Fig. 1). Among various lysophospholipids detected in the activated rat platelets, only LPC has been shown to be a substrate of lysoPLD. However, as shown in Fig. 2A, lysoPLD hydrolyzed other lysophospholipids, such as LPE, LPS, and LPI, to produce LPA. These results clearly indicate that, in the platelet-dependent pathway for LPA synthesis, lysophospholipids produced by activated platelets are converted to LPA by the action of lysoPLD present in blood plasma. We further examined the roles of sPLA2-IIA and PS-PLA1 in lysoPLD-enhanced LPA production in activated rat platelets, because the two PLAs are predominantly expressed in the cells and have been implicated in lysophospholipid production in activated platelets (24Yokoyama K. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1280-1287Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, addition of recombinant sPLA2-IIA or PS-PLA1 dramatically increased the LPA production evoked by addition of recombinant lysoPLD from activated platelets stimulated with either thrombin or A23187. This suggests that the two PLAs are involved in serum LPA production through their roles in supplying lysophospholipids to lysoPLD. We further determined whether erythrocytes or white blood cells are involved in serum LPA production. To examine LPA production in blood cells, we incubated erythrocytes, white blood cells, and platelets prepared from rat blood with a physiological concentration of recombinant lysoPLD. Of the different cell types examined, platelets were by far the most potent in producing LPA and LPC per cell (Fig. 4, A and C). However, a low but significant concentration of LPA (0.17 ± 0.02 μm) was detected in the culture supernatant of erythrocytes, when physiological cell numbers (6.5 × 109 cells/ml) were applied (Fig. 4B). LPC was also detected in the cell supernatant (Fig. 4C). Thus, lysophospholipids associated with erythrocytes, possibly LPC, can be a substrate for lysoPLD, which can explain part of the serum LPA production in the platelet-independent pathway. Both LPA and LPC are produced in plasma during prolonged incubation at 37 °C in rat (32Tokumura A. Harada K. Fukuzawa K. Tsukatani H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 31-38Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, we confirmed that incubation of plasma or serum both from rat and human at 37 °C increased the accumulation of both LPA and LPC in a time course-dependent manner. The formation of LPA in serum is much faster than that in plasma, especially in the initial period (1–6 h). LPC concentration in serum was slightly higher than that in plasma (Fig. 5), indicating that lysophospholipids accumulated in incubated serum can be derived both from plasma phospholipids and, as a result of blood coagulation, from platelet phospholipids. It is likely that lysoPLD converts these lysophospholipids to LPA. Consistent with this idea, the addition of recombinant lysoPLD to the plasma dramatically increased the formation of LPA and resulted in a smaller increase in LPC (Fig. 6). A similar result was obtained in incubated serum (data not shown). Addition of a divalent cation chelator such as EDTA or EGTA to the incubation medium almost completely inhibited the accumulation of LPA but did not affect the accumulation of LPC (Fig. 6, EGTA data not shown). This observation strongly indicates that LPC present or generated during the incubation in plasma is converted to LPA by lysoPLD activity, and it is compatible with the fact that the enzyme requires a divalent cation for its activity (33Tokumura A. Miyake M. Yoshimoto O. Shimizu M. Fukuzawa K. Lipids. 1998; 33: 1009-1015Google Scholar).Figure 6LysoPLD accelerates LPA formation in incubated rat plasma and is sensitive to a divalent cation chelator. Plasma was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated period either in the presence (closed circles) or absence (open circles) of lysoPLD, and the amounts of LPA and LPC formed were determined. The same reaction was performed in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and lysoPLD (closed squares) and in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and in the absence of lysoPLD (open squares). Recombinant lysoPLD was added to a final concentration that was ten times as much as that detected in rat plasma. The data are representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We further examined the mechanism of LPC formation in incubated plasma. It has been suggested that part of the LPC present in blood is due to the activities of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (25Sekas G. Patton G.M. Lincoln E.C. Robins S.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1985; 105: 190-194Google Scholar) or platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) activities (27Watson A.D. Navab M. Hama S.Y. Sevanian A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 774-782Google Scholar). The formation of LPC during incubation was insensitive to EDTA (see Fig. 8), which is compatible with the properties of the two plasma enzymes (34Dobiasova M. Schutzova M. Physiol. Bohemoslov. 1986; 35: 464-472Google Scholar, 35Satoh K. Imaizumi T. Kawamura Y. Yoshida H. Hiramoto M. Takamatsu S. Takamatsu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 476-481Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of these enzymes to the accumulation of LPC in plasma during incubation, we examined the plasma LPC level of human subjects deficient in LCAT (FLD) or PAF-AH. As was observed in plasma from normal subjects (Fig. 5), the LPC level increased during incubation at 37 °C in the PAF-AH-deficient plasma. On the other hand, LPC did not form at all in the plasma from LCAT-deficient patients (Fig. 7), which confirmed that LCAT is responsible for the accumulation of LPC in the incubated plasma. In addition, it was revealed that LPA accumulation was significantly suppressed in LCAT-deficient plasma but not in the control or PAF-AH-deficient plasma (Fig. 7). The LCAT-deficient plasma had a comparable level of LPC (∼100 μm) (Fig. 7), indicating that a part of the plasma LPC can also be produced by an LCAT-independent pathway.Figure 7LPA and LPC formation in plasma from LCAT - or PAF-AH-deficient subjects. Plasma samples from an LCAT-deficient patient (FDL, closed circles), a PAF-AH-deficient donor (open squares), and a healthy volunteer (open circles) were incubated at 37 °C, and the time course-dependent accumulations of LPA and LPC were determined. The data are representative of two different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The present study was undertaken to clarify how LPA is produced in serum. There are at least four synthetic pathways for serum LPA (Fig. 8). The major two pathways identified in the present study are 1) secretion of lysophospholipids such as LPC, LPE, and LPS from platelets, followed by conversion of the lysophospholipids to LPA (Fig. 2) and 2) g"

ALS 1The abbreviations used are: ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; FALS, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; SOD1, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase; CCS, copper chaperone protein; ANS, 8-anilino-1-napthalene-sulfonic acid; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide is a fatal neuromuscular disease that presents as weakness, spasticity, and muscle atrophy. The disease is caused by selective degeneration of motor neurons in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. Although ALS presents mostly as a sporadic disease, a familial form of ALS is seen in ∼10% of cases. Twenty percent of familial ALS (FALS) cases are caused by point mutations in the SOD1 gene. More than 90 distinct amino acid mutations spread throughout the sequence of this 153-residue protein have been identified (1Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Google Scholar). The finding that many FALS-associated SOD1 mutants possess full specific enzyme activity (2Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Google Scholar) suggests that the disease is not caused by loss of normal dismutase activity. Further support for this idea has come from transgenic mice studies. Transgenic mice that harbor FALS-associated SOD1mutations develop ALS-like symptoms despite having greater than normal levels of SOD1 activity, including the normal complement of endogenous mouse SOD1 enzyme (3Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Ohama E. Reaume A.G. Scott R.W. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1851-1854Google Scholar). Furthermore, SOD1 knockout mice do not develop ALS-like symptoms. Thus, it has been proposed that mutations in SOD1 cause FALS by a gain, rather than a loss, of function (reviewed in Ref. 1Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Google Scholar). One proposed gain of function involves free radical generation by SOD1. Because the dismutase action of SOD1 runs in a reversible catalytic cycle with a number of different possible substrates (4Yim M.B. Kang J. Yim H. Kwak H. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Google Scholar, 5Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.D. Roe J.A. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Google Scholar, 6Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 166-171Google Scholar), under some conditions, SOD1 may catalyze the reverse reaction and generate radical species. It has been proposed that certain FALS-associated SOD1 mutants have lower K m values for hydrogen peroxide in the reverse reaction and therefore possess greater free radical generating activity than do wild-type enzymes. This makeup ultimately allows a greater number of cytotoxic peroxidation reactions to occur in these mutants (4Yim M.B. Kang J. Yim H. Kwak H. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Google Scholar, 5Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.D. Roe J.A. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Google Scholar). The exact species responsible for oxidative damage, however, has recently come under question. Fridovich and co-worker (7Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34674-34678Google Scholar) showed that the production of hydroxyl radicals would be negligible because of competition with bicarbonate ions for hydroxyl radicals bound to copper in SOD1. Another possible gain of function implicates the formation of zinc-deficient enzyme as the common toxic entity derived from all mutants. One property shared by many FALS-associated SOD1 mutants is a decreased affinity for Zn2+ (8Lyons T.J. Hongbin L. Joy J.G. Nersissian A. Roe J.A. Graden J.A. Café C. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D.E. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12240-12244Google Scholar, 9Crow J.P. Ye Y.Z. Strong M. Kirk M. Barnes S. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Google Scholar). It has been proposed that reduced Zn2+ binding destabilizes the structure of SOD1, increasing the rate of abnormal reduction of bound Cu2+ to Cu+ by intracellular reducing agents. This reduced form of SOD1 could then catalyze the reverse enzymatic reaction and become a net producer of superoxide anion. In the absence of a well defined protein fold, the electrostatic gradient that is normally present in SOD1 (10Klapper I. Hagstrom R. Fine R. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins. 1986; 1: 47-59Google Scholar) does not exist to prevent diffusion of the resultant radical anion. Therefore, in the presence of nitric oxide, which reacts five times faster with superoxide than does SOD1 itself, zinc-deficient SOD1 becomes a net producer of peroxynitrite (11Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter C. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Google Scholar). Thus, the zinc-deficient SOD1 hypothesis maintains that peroxynitrite is the final mediator of oxidative neuronal injury and works by either nitrating and/or oxidizing critical cellular targets. Active site copper plays a critical role in both of the proposed mechanisms for a gain of function of FALS-associated SOD1 mutants described above. A recent study that used transgenic mice that expressed FALS-associated SOD1 mutants but lacked the gene for the copper chaperone protein (CCS) investigated whether alterations in copper loading would affect disease pathobiology (12Subramanium J.R. Lyons E.W. Liu J. Bartnikas T.B. Rothstein J. Price D.L. Cleveland D.W. Gitlin J.D. Wong P.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 301-307Google Scholar). CCS facilitates the incorporation of Cu2+ into SOD1 in vivo (13Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Google Scholar,14Wong P.C. Waggoner D. Subramaniam J.R. Tessarollo L. Bartnikas T.B. Culotta V.C. Price D.L. Rothstein J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2886-2891Google Scholar), and copper is essential for normal dismutase activity as well as for any gained functions that are oxidant-mediated. The transgenic study found that knocking out the CCS gene reduced copper incorporation into FALS-associated SOD1 mutants; however, disease onset and progression in the mouse model was largely unaffected. The fact that 20–30% of total SOD1 activity remained in the absence of CCS prevents this study (12Subramanium J.R. Lyons E.W. Liu J. Bartnikas T.B. Rothstein J. Price D.L. Cleveland D.W. Gitlin J.D. Wong P.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 301-307Google Scholar) from completely ruling out copper-mediated mechanisms of toxicity in SOD1 transgenic mice, but it does suggest that other mechanisms such as protein aggregation may play an important role in the overall cytotoxicity. Another dramatic gain of function exhibited by SOD1 mutants is a very high propensity to aggregate (3Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Ohama E. Reaume A.G. Scott R.W. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1851-1854Google Scholar, 15Koide T. Igarashi S. Kikugawa K. Nakano R. Inuzuka T. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 257: 29-32Google Scholar). COS7 cells transfected with FALS-associated SOD1 mutants produce cytoplasmic aggregates composed of the SOD1 mutant protein; transfections of wild-type SOD1, on the other hand, do not cause such cellular alterations (15Koide T. Igarashi S. Kikugawa K. Nakano R. Inuzuka T. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 257: 29-32Google Scholar). A number of transgenic mice, all of which expressed a particular FALS-associated SOD1 mutant and co-expressed different amounts of wild-typeSOD1, were shown to uniformly exhibit intracellular SOD aggregation in neural tissue as well as ALS-like symptoms regardless of whether wild-type SOD1 expression was elevated or eliminated (3Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Ohama E. Reaume A.G. Scott R.W. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1851-1854Google Scholar). SOD1 aggregates have been proposed to produce toxicity by interference with normal proteasome function (16Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Google Scholar) or by altering chaperone (e.g. heat shock protein 70) (17Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Google Scholar, 18Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9010-9014Google Scholar) activity. In the present study, we sought to elucidate physiologically relevant environmental factors that may trigger aggregation of SOD1 in motor neurons. SOD1 aggregates seen in ALS patients and transgenic mouse models are limited to neural tissue (motor neurons and, occasionally, neighboring astrocytes) and are not seen in other cell types. Given that SOD1 is present in high concentrations in all cells, an environmental factor must exist within motor neurons that induces aggregation specifically in this cell type. Two differences between SOD1 molecules in motor neurons and other cells are its long half-life and higher concentration. Concentration of SOD1 is greater in motor neurons than in other neurons and glial cells, and it is found not only in the cell body of motor neurons but also within axons and nerve termini (19Pardo C.A. Xu Z. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Sisodia S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 954-958Google Scholar). To reach the nerve termini, SOD1 is transported through the axon by using the slow component b of the anterograde axonal transport system (20Borchelt D.R. Wong P.C. Becher M.W. Pardo C.A. Lee M.K. Xu Z.S. Thinakaran G. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Price D.L. Hoffman P.N. Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 5: 27-35Google Scholar), which has a rate of 2–8 mm/day. Thus, the transport time for motor neurons with a meter-long axon could approach 500 days, and the life span of the protein must exceed the transport time. The long life span of this protein increases the chances of oxidative modification by reactive oxygen species; one possible byproduct of oxidative modification is induction of protein aggregation. The greater life span of SOD1 in motor neurons means that it would have more opportunity to accumulate oxidative modifications and to be altered in ways that could increase its own production of abnormal oxidants (i.e. to become zinc-deficient and catalyze the formation of peroxynitrite). 2M. J. Strong, W. L. Strong, B. P. He, M. M. Sopper, and J. P. Crow, personal communication.Oxidative damage to SOD1, either self-induced or the result of other oxidant sources, in turn may trigger aggregation. In support of this hypothesis, markers of oxidative damage were shown to be significantly elevated in neural tissue of ALS patients as compared with controls (21Bowling A.C. Schulz J.B. Brown Jr., R.H. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2322-2325Google Scholar, 22Ferrante R.J. Browne S.E. Shinobu L.A. Bowling A.C. Baik M.J. MacGarvey U. Kowall N.W. Brown Jr., R.H. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2064-2074Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that oxidation triggers SOD1 aggregation, we examined the effects of oxidation on fully metallated wild-type SOD1 (holo-SOD1), on zinc-deficient SOD1, and on four SOD1 mutants. Wild-type Cu-Zn SOD1 from human erythrocytes was obtained from Sigma. Mutant and zinc-deficient SODs were prepared as described previously (9Crow J.P. Ye Y.Z. Strong M. Kirk M. Barnes S. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1936-1944Google Scholar). Oxidation reactions consisted of 10 μm SOD1, 4 mm ascorbic acid, and 0.2 mm CuCl2in 10 mm Tris, 10 mm acetate buffer, whereas control reactions were 10 μm SOD1 in buffer. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The pH was 7.0 unless stated otherwise. To readily recognize inhibition of SOD1 aggregation, the most aggregation-prone SOD1 species (zinc-deficient SOD1) was used. SOD1 aggregation mixtures (10 μm SOD1, 4 mm ascorbate, 0.2 mmCuCl2, 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7) were incubated with 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm mannitol, or 10 mm DMPO as probes for the reactive oxygen species. Anaerobic conditions were achieved by degassing all solutions and oxidizing them under vacuum (37 °C) in a vacuum hydrolysis tube (Pierce). Light scattering measurements were made with a Photon Technology International QM-1 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 350 nm (bandpass = 4 nm). All images were obtained by using a Digital Instruments NanoScope III© atomic force microscope. Samples were deposited and dried onto freshly cleaved mica under positive pressure. Contact-mode images were obtained by using a Si3N4 tip (Digital Instruments) with a nominal spring constant of 0.12 N/m. Electon microscopy grids (Canemco, Quebec, Canada) were floated on 10 μl drops of SOD1 samples, negative stained with uranyl acetate (MecaLab Inc., Quebec, Canada), and examined in an FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (80 kV accelerating voltage). Amino acid compositions of oxidized and control SOD1 were determined by using the Waters Picotag Amino Acid Analysis system, which uses gas phase acid hydrolysis (6nHCl, 120 °C), and either precolumn derivitization with phenylisothiocyanate or postcolumn derivitization with ninhydrin. Peptides were analyzed by using a Q-TOF Ultima mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) coupled to a capillary high-pressure liquid chromatography. Peptides eluted by acetonitrile were ionized by electrospray, and peptide ions were automatically selected and fragmented in a data-dependent acquisition mode. Data base searching was done with Mascot (Matrix Science). 10 μm SOD1 in 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0) was incubated for 30 min with 20 μm ANS or 20 μm thioflavin T before measuring emission spectrum (excitation at 372 and 450 nm, respectively). SOD1 aggregates were diluted to a final concentration of 3 μm (∼100 μg/ml) and incubated with 6 μm Congo red for 30 min before measuring near-UV and visible absorbance. Zinc-deficient SOD1 aggregates were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was removed and replaced with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Aggregates were then resuspended by vortex and sonication before CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv CD spectrometer model 62 DS at 25 °C. We used metal-catalyzed oxidation with CuCl2 and ascorbic acid to generate reactive oxygen species because of the physiological relevance of this system. Metal-catalyzed oxidation is the principal source of hydroxyl radicals under normal physiological conditions (23Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 485-494Google Scholar), and it is especially important under conditions of oxidative stress (24Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Google Scholar). The concentrations of ascorbic acid used in this study (2–4 mm) are well within the normal concentration range (0.5–10 mm) found in neurons and glial cells (25Rice M. Trends. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 209-216Google Scholar). We examined the effects of oxidation on three different ALS-associated mutants of SOD1: A4V, D90A, and G93A, as well as a site-directed mutant (D124N) that has decreased zinc-binding affinity (26Banci L. Bertini I. Cabelli D.E. Hallewell R.A. Tung J.W. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 123-128Google Scholar) and serves as a model of zinc-deficient SOD1. A4V is the most common mutation that causes FALS, D90A causes a rare autosomal recessive form of FALS (1Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Google Scholar), and G93A is the mutant most widely used for the transgenic mouse model of ALS. We examined the effect of oxidation on the zinc-deficient form of wild-type SOD1, because this species has been implicated in neurotoxicity associated with ALS (11Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter C. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Google Scholar) and because it can use ascorbate to produce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide directly. We find that at a neutral pH, oxidation of each of the three SOD1 mutants and zinc-deficient wild-type SOD1 induces the formation of large aggregates that scatter light (Fig.1 A). The zinc-deficient protein displayed the most robust aggregation reaction and, interestingly, D90A, the mutation that causes an autosomal recessive form of FALS, displayed the least amount of aggregate formation. Oxidation of wild-type SOD1 under identical conditions did not induce the formation of aggregates detectable by right-angle light scattering (i.e. visible aggregates >350 nm in diameter). With the exception of zinc-deficient SOD1, aggregates did not form in control samples that lacked oxidants. The small amount of aggregate observed in control samples of zinc-deficient protein suggests that this form of the protein has an intrinsic aggregation tendency. The aggregation reaction displays distinct pH dependence, with reduced aggregation at pH < 5.5 (Fig. 1 B). Similar pH dependence has been observed in the oxidation-induced aggregation of human relaxin, in which oxidation of a single His residue apparently accounts for the pH dependence (27Khossravi M. Shire S.J. Borchardt R.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5876-5885Google Scholar). Performance of the oxidation reaction under anaerobic conditions or in the presence of EDTA inhibited aggregation and revealed that copper and oxygen are an absolute requirement for oxidation-induced aggregation (Fig. 1 C). On the other hand, the addition of the free radical scavengers mannitol and DMPO did not inhibit aggregation (Fig. 1 C). Similar results have been obtained with copper-catalyzed, oxidation-induced aggregation of both human relaxin (28Li S. Nguyen T.H. Schoneich C. Borchardt R.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5762-5772Google Scholar) and hamster prion protein (29Requena J.R. Groth D. Legname G. Stadtman E.R. Pruisner S.B. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7170-7175Google Scholar). The insensitivity to free radical scavengers and the pH dependence of the oxidation-induced aggregation are consistent with the site-specific metal-catalyzed oxidation mechanism. This mechanism requires a metal ion binding site that is in close spatial proximity to the modification sites (23Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 485-494Google Scholar). In this type of oxidation reaction, very few residues are modified. Amino acid analysis was performed on oxidized wild-type protein and on oxidized and aggregated zinc-deficient SOD1 (Table I). The most striking feature of the amino acid analysis of both types of oxidized protein was the loss of histidine residues. Amino acid analysis suggested that three of the eight histidine residues of the SOD1 subunit were modified. It is known that metal-catalyzed oxidation of proteins leads to conversion of histidine residues to 2-oxohistidine, 4-hydroxy-glutamate, aspartate, or asparagine (23Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 485-494Google Scholar). Because the glutamate and aspartate contents do not appear to be altered by oxidation, it is likely that histidines have been largely converted to 2-oxohistidines. Further support for the conversion to 2-oxohistidine was obtained by sequencing tryptic peptides of oxidized wild-type SOD1 by LC-MS/MS (TableII). The masses of two tryptic peptides were increased by 16 mass units, which is consistent with the formation of 2-oxohistidine. Peptide sequencing revealed that both His 80 and His 120 contain an additional 16 mass units; these residues are located at the zinc and copper binding sites, respectively, of SOD1 (Fig.2).Table IComparison of relative amino acid composition of oxidized to control SOD1Amino acidRatio oxidized/controlWild-type SOD1Zinc-deficient SOD1Aspartic acid1.001.01Threonine1.021.03Serine1.011.00Glutamic acid1.061.00Glycine1.001.03Valine1.001.03Isoleucine0.951.02Leucine0.990.95Phenylalanine0.940.94Histidine0.630.62Lysine0.950.84Arginine0.970.87Proline0.910.93Alanine1.071.00 Open table in a new tab Table IITryptic peptide sequencePositionTheoretical mass [M + H]+Experimental massModified amino acidControlOxidizedHVGDLGNVTADK80–911225.61225.61225.6His801241.6His80 + His16TLVVHEK116–122825.5825.5825.5His120841.5His120 + His16Summary of mass spectroscopic analysis of tryptic fragments of oxidized SOD1 Open table in a new tab Summary of mass spectroscopic analysis of tryptic fragments of oxidized SOD1 The results presented here demonstrate that oxidation of select His residues induces misfolding and aggregation of SOD1. However, the question remains, do these in vitro aggregates represent aggregates seen in ALS? Examination of ALS inclusion bodies by light, electron, and immunoelectron microscopy have shown them to be a unique feature of ALS and distinct from the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles seen in Alzheimer's disease and the intracellular deposits seen in Parkinson's disease (30Okamoto K. Hirai S. Yamazaki T. Sun X. Nakazato Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 129: 233-236Google Scholar, 31Hudson A.J. Brain. 1981; 104: 217-247Google Scholar, 32Sillevis Smitt P.A.E. Troost D. Louwerse E.S. De Jong J.M.B.V. Van Kessel D.T.P. De Leeuw M.A. Clin. Neuropathol. 1993; 12: 88-91Google Scholar). In particular, ALS inclusion bodies are not stained by the amyloid dye Congo red (30Okamoto K. Hirai S. Yamazaki T. Sun X. Nakazato Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 129: 233-236Google Scholar). Instead, the inclusion bodies seen in COS7 cells that express ALS mutants of SOD1 (15Koide T. Igarashi S. Kikugawa K. Nakano R. Inuzuka T. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 257: 29-32Google Scholar), transgenic mouse models of ALS (3Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L.

Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A. Lind M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6953-6957Google Scholar). Our atomic force microscopy examination of aggregates formed by oxidation of zinc-deficient SOD1 revealed large amorphous aggregates (<10 μm diameter) that were composed of smaller globular particles (0.2–0.5 μm diameter) (Fig.3 A) reminiscent of in vivo inclusion bodies (34Kato S. Shimoda M. Watanabe Y. Nakashima K. Takahashi K. Ohama E. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 1089-1101Google Scholar, 35Kato S. Hayashi H. Nakashima K. Nanba E. Kato M. Hirano A. Nakano I.

Neuropathology. 2001; 21: 67-81Google Scholar). Incubation of oxidized wild-type protein at pH 5 produced a scant number of aggregates that could be detected by negative staining electron microscopy. These heterogeneous aggregates were composed of amorphous aggregates along with fibrous aggregates that were 40 nm in diameter and several micrometers long (Fig. 3 B). These fibrous aggregates are thicker than the amyloid fibrils formed by the Alzheimer amyloid peptide, which are 60–90 Å in diameter (38Kirschner D.A. Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A. Lind M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6953-6957Google Scholar). Dye binding experiments with thioflavin T and Congo red, as well as CD, were also used to determine whether the SOD1 aggregates possessed amyloid characteristics. A 2-fold enhancement of thioflavin T fluorescence was observed with the aggregates produced from zinc-deficient SOD1 (Fig. 4 A); however, the fluorescence enhancement seen with amyloid fibrils is usually 3 orders of magnitude higher (39Levine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Google Scholar). On binding to Congo red, very little, if any, increase was seen in absorbance or spectral shift (Fig. 4B), which would have been expected had the aggregates in fact been amyloid (40Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-304Google Scholar). This lack of increase is in keeping with the failure of Congo red to bind SOD inclusion bodies in vivo (30Okamoto K. Hirai S. Yamazaki T. Sun X. Nakazato Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 129: 233-236Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of SOD1 undergoes a large change on oxidation-induced aggregation (Fig. 4C). However, the CD spectrum of SOD1 aggregates indicates random coil rather than the characteristic β-sheet spectrum of amyloid. Thus, although it appears that oxidative damage of SOD1 results in misfolding and aggregation, the resultant aggregates do not appear to be amyloid. Indeed, the morphology of the aggregates observed in vitro in this study compare favorably with that of granular SOD1 inclusions observed in ALS models and patients. To determine whether susceptibility to oxidation-induced aggregation of zinc-deficient SOD1 and SOD1 mutants results from an altered conformation, ANS dye binding experiments were performed on untreated unoxidized protein samples. ANS binding is a probe of exposed hydrophobic surfaces in proteins. Zinc-deficient SOD1 bound the most ANS, wild-type SOD1 did not show any ANS binding, and the SOD1 mutants displayed varying intermediate degrees of ANS binding (Fig.5). It is known that the bound zinc in SOD1 helps maintain the structure of the active site and is not directly involved in catalysis, and removal of zinc destabilizes the enzyme (41Rodriguez J.A. Valentine J.S. Eggers D.K. Roe J.A. Tiwari A. Brown Jr., R.H. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15932-15937Google Scholar). The ANS binding experiments indicate that in addition to general destabilization, an alteration in conformation that leads to exposure of hydrophobic surface is also associated with zinc removal. The intermediate levels of ANS binding observed with the SOD1 mutants may have resulted from an altered looser conformation of the protein in solution, as has been suggested by the crystal structures of mutant SOD1 (42Hart P.J. Pellegrini M. Nersissian A.M. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 545-555Google Scholar). Alternatively, the intermediate ANS binding may result from heterogeneity in the metallation status of the mutants, in which mutant preparations that show the greatest ANS binding contain significant quantities of incompletely metallated protein, much of which could be zinc-deficient. We have shown that zinc-deficient SOD1, a site-directed mutant with low zinc binding affinity, low zinc content (D124N), and three FALS-associated SOD1 mutants, is much more susceptible to oxidation-induced aggregation than the fully metallated wild-type protein. These findings, coupled with the long half-life of SOD1 in motor neurons and the high levels of oxidative damage that are known to occur in neural tissues of ALS patients (21Bowling A.C. Schulz J.B. Brown Jr., R.H. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2322-2325Google Scholar), provide a possible explanation for the SOD1 aggregates observed in ALS. Although it still remains to be established whether the SOD1 aggregates are intrinsically toxic, evidence is mounting that protein aggregates exhibit a general toxicity that is independent of the function of the protein in its native state (43Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddel N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 483-484Google Scholar). Our data are also consistent with the recent model put forward by Okado- Matsumoto and Fridovich (18Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9010-9014Google Scholar) in which antiapoptotic factors such as heat shock proteins are sequestered by abundant misfolded/aggregated proteins, such as SOD1 or other misfolded proteins induced by oxidation/nitration, leading to apoptosis.

In the present investigation, thein vitro assembly of a recombinant amyloidogenic light chain variable domain, SMA, on various surfaces was monitored using atomic force microscopy. SMA formed fibrils on native mica at pH 5.0, conditions under which predominantly amorphous aggregates form in solution. Fibril formation was accelerated significantly on surfaces compared with solution; for example, fibrils grew on surfaces at significantly faster rates and at much lower concentrations than in solution. No fibrils were observed on hydrophobic or positively charged surfaces or at pH >7.0. Two novel types of fibril growth were observed on the surface: bidirectional linear assembly of oligomeric units, and linear growth from preformed amorphous cores. In addition to catalyzing the rate of fibrillation, the mechanism of fibril formation on the surfaces was significantly different from in solution, but it may be more physiologically relevant because in vivo the deposits are associated with surfaces.

The molecular mechanisms leading to protein deposition are not well known. SMA belongs to the κIV family of Ig LCs, was extracted from lymph node-derived amyloid fibrils of an AL amyloidosis patient, and corresponds to the variable domain region. Our in vitro experiments with recombinant SMA (114 residues, 12.7 kDa) have demonstrated that the protein aggregates via partially folded intermediates to form ordered aggregates such as protofibrils and fibrils as well as disordered amorphous aggregates (7Ionescu-Zanetti C. Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Petrick J.S. Trabachino L.C. Minert L.J. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13175-13179Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 8Khurana R.

Earlier studies suggested that insoluble fibrils and amorphous protein deposits play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of amyloid disease (9Kim Y.S. Cape S.P. Chi E. Raffen R. Wilkins-Stevens P.

Therefore, there is great interest in understanding the morphologies of LC domains on the aggregation pathway. Previous work on the in vitro system focused predominantly on the morphological properties of SMA aggregates grown from solution. Because LCs are frequently found to deposit in arterial walls and basement membranes (2Sasaki A. Iijima M. Yokoo H. Shoji M. Nakazato Y. Brain Res. 1997; 755: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), interfacial phenomena and the interaction between protein and the surface may be involved in the aggregation process. In LC deposition disease the amorphous deposits are found associated with the basement membrane (16Gallo G. Goni F. Boctor F. Vidal R. Kumar A. Stevens F.J. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1397-1406PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of 10-nm diameter LC amyloid fibrils along the epithelial basement membrane as well as in the vascular walls was ascertained by electron microscopy (2Sasaki A. Iijima M. Yokoo H. Shoji M. Nakazato Y. Brain Res. 1997; 755: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). There is at least one report of the association of SMA with cell membranes (17Wall J.S. Ayoub F.M. O'Shea P.S. Frontiers Biosci. 1996; 1: 46-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current work focuses on the morphologies of protein aggregates on surfaces. At present, more than 18 different amyloidogenic proteins or peptides have been identified which are associated with protein deposition disease. These proteins share similar morphology of fibrils (18Koo E.H. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9989-9990Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 19Blacky H.K.L. Sanders G.H.W. Davies M.C. Roberts C.J. Tendler S.J.B. Wilkinson M.J. J. Mol.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), all forming twisted, linear, Congo Red-binding fibrils, typically 5–10 nm in diameter with a crossed β-pleated sheet conformation. There is already some evidence that surfaces may be crucial for fibril formation of Aβ peptide. The size and the shape of Aβ peptide aggregates, as well as the kinetics of their formation, exhibited pronounced dependence on the physicochemical nature of the surface. On hydrophilic mica, Aβ peptide formed linear assemblies with an average height of 5–6 nm, whereas on hydrophobic graphite the Aβ peptide formed uniform, elongated sheets 1 nm in height (22Kowalewski T. Moltzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Fibrils of amylin formed on mica also exhibited different types of morphologies, lacking the twisted rope-like morphology seen in those grown in solution (23Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Some proteins have been shown to interact with membranes, which may affect fibril formation (24Jo E.

Lansbury P T., Jr. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7812-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The involvement of surfaces could be universal for all amyloid-associated proteins. We have observed that the in vitro fibril formation of SMA is sensitive to the test tube materials and the nature of the beads used for stirring. This can be explained by surface interactions and subsequent conformation changes caused by the attachment of the protein to the surface. We have also observed that the fibrillation of α-synuclein, a protein associated with Parkinson's disease, depended on the nature of the surfaces present in the incubating solution. Therefore, the investigation of the surface dependence of fibril formation is also significant for the mechanism of fibril formation of other amyloid proteins. AFM is a powerful technique for studying the morphology and structure of amyloid fibrils, with high resolution and imaging ability in air and fluid, i.e. dry or solution samples. Previously, we have monitored the fibril assembly of the Ig LC SMA in solution by AFM, and a model for fibril formation involving a hierarchical assembly process from protofilaments (2.4 nm) to protofibrils (4.0 nm) to fibrils (8.0 nm) in diameter was proposed (7Ionescu-Zanetti C. Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Petrick J.S. Trabachino L.C. Minert L.J. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13175-13179Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A system has been devised forin situ AFM observation of fibril formation using a fluid cell with mica as the supporting substrate. This in situsystem permits observation of the time course of fibril formation. Thus, various transient aggregation species, such as oligomers, protofibrils, as well as mature fibrils, can be observed by AFM (19Blacky H.K.L. Sanders G.H.W. Davies M.C. Roberts C.J. Tendler S.J.B.

In one reported case, the final fibril diameter and morphology observed on mica were different from those observed when fibrils were grown in solution (23Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The current study also demonstrates that care must be used when comparing the results fromin situ experiments in which the fibrils are grown on a surface and ex situ experiments in which the fibrils are grown in solution because the fibril formation process may be surface-dependent. The present work focuses on the morphology of SMA aggregates deposited on surfaces as a function of time of incubation. The adsorption of protein on the surface was studied and correlated with fibril formation. Based on the data, a model for SMA fibril assembly is proposed. The SMA expression system was a gift from Dr. Fred Stevens (Argonne National Laboratories). The recombinant variable domain SMA was purified following the reported protocol (1Myatt E.A. Westholm F.A.

The extract was dialyzed in 10 mmacetate buffer (pH 5.6) and loaded on a SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted using 10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The purity of the 2-ml fractions collected was assessed by SDS-PAGE. The purest fractions were pooled and concentrated by Centriprep R (10,000 molecular weight cutoff) and filtered through 0.22-μm filters before being stored in glass vials. Protein concentrations were measured via A 280 nmusing the extinction coefficient of E 0.1% = 1.8. The purity of the protein was assayed by SDS-PAGE. A filtered protein sample (0.22 μm) was treated with 0.001m NaOH for 15 min to remove any preformed aggregates, then adjusted to a lower pH. Fibrils were grown from purified protein at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in 120 μl of solution with a piece of freshly cleaved mica (4 × 4 mm) in a plastic vial. The solution was incubated at 37 °C without agitation. Fibril growth experiments in mica-free solution involved incubating 50 μg/ml purified protein at 37 °C with shaking at 960 rpm. The standard buffer solution included 20 mm HCl (pH 2.0), 20 mm HEPES (pH 5.0), or 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), with 200 mmNaCl. Fibril formation was monitored using light scattering and a fluorescence assay based on the enhanced fluorescence of the dye thioflavin T (ThT) on binding to amyloid fibrils (20Nielsen L. Khurana R.

Both Rayleigh light scattering and fluorescence intensity were measured using a Fluoromax-2 (Jobin-Yvon/SPEX Inc.) spectrofluorometer. At each point time, a 220-μl sample was removed to measure Rayleigh light scattering at 330 nm with a 1-nm bandpass for both excitation and emission monochromators. ThT binding assays were conducted by adding a 10-μl sample to 990 μl of 20 μm ThT in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl. The fluorescence intensities were measured at 482 nm with excitation at 450 nm using a 5-nm bandpass on both the excitation and emission monochromators. In some experiments, fibrils were produced by incubating the same solution containing 4 μm ThT at 37 °C and agitation at 600 rpm with a shaking diameter of 1 mm. Fluorescence intensity was recorded in situ at 15-min intervals using a Fluoroskan Ascent CF (Thermo Labsystems, Finland) plate reader with emission at 482 nm and excitation at 444 nm. Teflon-coated stir bars or beads were used to increase the agitation. Mica was alkylamine functionalized with 4-aminobutyl triethoxysilane to form a positively charged surface following the literature method (30Yang Z. Yu H. Langmuir. 1999; 15: 1731-1737Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and modified with octadecyltrichlorosilane to form a hydrophobic surface following the reported method (31Tang Z. Jing W. Wang E. Langmuir. 2000; 16: 1696-1702Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both were purchased from Gelest, Inc. (Tullytown, PA). Plastic vials (United Scientific Products) and quartz cells for UV measurements were treated with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4) for 5 h before use. After such treatment, SMA did not absorb to the vial or cell as determined by measuring the concentration of protein in solution after a 24-h incubation at 37 °C. A mica sheet (4 × 4 mm) was put into the treated tube containing 120 μl of 0.5 mg/ml SMA in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing 200 mm NaCl and incubated at 37 °C. At each sample time point (see below), the protein concentrations were measured by A 280 nm. The adsorption of protein on the mica and stir beads was estimated by subtracting the protein concentration in solution from the total concentration. Mica was removed at each time point from one of the incubation vials described above for AFM measurements, while a 5-μl aliquot from the same vial was transferred to a freshly cleaved mica surface at the same time. The mica-adsorbed samples were washed with water to remove unbound protein and dried with N2 or air-dried overnight. AFM imaging was performed with an Autoprobe CP Multiple AFM (Park Scientific) in noncontact (tapping) mode. Measurements were carried out using silicon cantilevers with a spring constant of 50 newtons/m (Park Scientific) and a resonance frequency of 290–350 kHz. The images were acquired using the 100-μm Scanmaster and 5-μm scanner for high resolution imaging at a scan rate of 0.5 Hz for both scanners. All images were captured at 512 × 512 scans. Height sizes in the range of 2.5–50 nm were estimated by section analysis using the PSI program without calibration, and lateral sizes in the range of 10–100 nm were calibrated with various standard gold colloid particles using the same type of probe and similar set point for imaging. Some of the images were modified using SPIP software (Image Metrology, Denmark). At least four regions of the mica surface were examined to verify that similar structures existed throughout the sample. In our previous study of SMA aggregation in solution, SMA formed typical fibrils over the range of pH 8.0–2.0; however, the yield of fibrils increased with decreasing pH. Fibrillation competed with the formation of amorphous deposits at all pH values, but the latter was negligible at low pH (e.g. pH 2). At pH 5.0 amorphous aggregates were the predominant aggregated material, and few fibrils were observed under these conditions (8Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Talapatra A. Menert L.J. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Millett I. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3525-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential role of surfaces in amyloid fibril formation we incubated small pieces of mica in solutions of SMA, typically under conditions (low protein concentration, no agitation) where fibrils were not formed over a time period of a week or longer in bulk solution. The time course of aggregation was followed by imaging the mica surface after removal from the incubation solution using AFM. By chemically modifying the surface of the mica it was possible to change the nature of the surface, both in terms of net charge and also hydrophobicity. When small (4 × 4 mm) sheets of mica were incubated (without agitation) in solutions of SMA at pH 5.0, 37 °C, amorphous aggregates were observed within a short time of incubation, and fibrils were observed starting around 10 h. These results were obtained with protein concentrations of 50 μg/ml, conditions under which no fibrils were formed in solution, thus indicating a strong accelerating effect of the surface. For much of the incubation period different types of aggregate were visible on the mica surface, indicative of multiple concurrent processes. Two major sources for fibrillar material were observed, discussed in detail below: 1) fibrils growing of amorphous aggregates, which was the predominant fibrillation process; and 2) fibrils assembling from oligomers. Neither of these processes is commonly thought of as a fibrillation mechanism, although there is precedent for the former (19Blacky H.K.L. Sanders G.H.W. Davies M.C. Roberts C.J. Tendler S.J.B.

A. 1999; 96: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In the present study we noticed an interesting phenomenon on the mica surface, namely the formation of fibrils growing out of amorphous aggregates; we will call this fibril assembly mechanism 1. At early times (2–4 h), SMA samples prepared at pH 5.0 showed the presence of spherical amorphous deposits on the mica surface with heights in the range of 18–90 nm (Fig. 1 A). By 12 h, as illustrated in Fig. 2, these amorphous spheroids had one to nine “fibrils” growing from them. Based on the height of the fibrillar material, about 5.0 nm, we will call these protofibrils (7Ionescu-Zanetti C. Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Petrick J.S. Trabachino L.C. Minert L.J. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13175-13179Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After 8 days, typically more than 10 protofibrils were radiating from the central amorphous core. The lengths of the protofibrils increased from around 100 nm at 12–16 h to several μm in 6 days (Fig. 2 F). However, the height of the fibrils remained constant at 4.8 ± 0.8 nm at all times. The size of the amorphous aggregates increased over the first 20 h but then appeared to remain relatively constant until finally decreasing at longer times (≥6 days). The protofibrils radiating from the amorphous core were linear and smooth; no branched fibrils were observed. After 6 days only a few of these protofibrils were twisted to form fibrils with distinct periodicity, probably because of spatial hindrance and association with the mica surface. One end of these protofibrils was tightly associated with the original amorphous core, and no cleavage from the core occurred. This observation indicates strong attachment of the fibrils to the amorphous aggregates. At all times (after 8–10 h) the amorphous aggregates with radiating protofibrils were the predominant aggregated species observed. The initial appearance of amorphous aggregates, followed more slowly by fibrillation, is consistent with solution experiments with SMA, in which amorphous aggregation appeared before fibril formation at pH 5.0. Using light scattering we were unable to find evidence for amorphous aggregate formation in solution under these experimental conditions; however, small aggregates might not be detected under the conditions used, especially at the very low protein concentrations involved. Attempts to use size-exclusion chromatography high performance liquid chromatography to detect oligomers failed because of the SMA sticking to the column.Figure 2AFM images of SMA fibrils growing from amorphous aggregates on mica surfaces at pH 5.0, showing fibril assembly mechanism 1. One (A), four (B andC), six (D), or nine (E) protofibrils radiated out from the central core by 12–16 h. The elongation of protofibrils leads to mature fibrils after 6 days (F). They axis is 1 μm for A–E and 5 μm forF. The large difference in height (lighter color represents larger heights) between the amorphous aggregates and the (proto)fibrils leads to decreased resolution of the much smaller protofibrils. Conditions were pH 5.0, 50 μg/ml protein, 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A second, slower mechanism of fibril formation was observed on mica at pH 5.0. By 16 h the AFM images revealed relatively uniform disk-shaped particles (Fig. 1 B). These are oligomeric deposits of defined size (Table I), corresponding to 20–24 individual SMA molecules (assuming a molecular volume similar to that of the native state). We will call these oligomeric units aggregation building block units, for reasons that will become apparent. Subsequently, pairs of these oligomers fuse over the 16–36-h range, as discussed below (Fig. 1 C).Table IDimensions of SMA oligomeric units and fibrils grown on mica at pH 5.0TimeHeightWidthLengthhnmnmnm165.5 ± 0.518 ± 116–18365.4 ± 0.817 ± 218–90 (1–5 units)1-aOne unit corresponds to a single disk-like oligomer, as seen at 16 h, and corresponds to approximately 20 monomers.454.8 ± 0.518 ± 235–140 (2–8 units)1-aOne unit corresponds to a single disk-like oligomer, as seen at 16 h, and corresponds to approximately 20 monomers.724.5 ± 0.5, 2.4 ± 0.222 ± 2, 14 ± 1.2≤ 400 (about 20 units)1-aOne unit corresponds to a single disk-like oligomer, as seen at 16 h, and corresponds to approximately 20 monomers.1444.3 ± 0.3, 2.4 ± 0.322 ± 1, 12 ± 0.5500 nm–1 μmThe protein concentration was 50 μg/ml; temperature was 37 °C, no agitation.1-a One unit corresponds to a single disk-like oligomer, as seen at 16 h, and corresponds to approximately 20 monomers. Open table in a new tab The protein concentration was 50 μg/ml; temperature was 37 °C, no agitation. The dimensions, including heights and lateral sizes of aggregates formed on the mica surfaces, were quantified by section analysis, and the results are shown in Table I. The lateral sizes of the samples were strongly influenced by the tip geometry. Hence, they were calibrated in terms of tip radius with the methods reported previously (32Koutsos V. van der Vegte E.W. Grim P.C.M. Hadziioannou G. Macromolecules. 1997; 31: 116-123Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Koutsos V. van der Vegte E.W. Pelletier E. Stamouli A. Hadziioannou G. Macromolecules. 1997; 30: 4719-4726Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and further confirmed by standard gold particles and electron microscopy data. The size homogeneity of the disk-shaped particles was examined by measuring the height distributions (Fig. 3), which were well represented by Gaussian curves. The aggregation building block units were ∼5.5 nm high (range 4.2–6.0 nm) and 15–18 nm wide. It is possible that these oligomeric units are initially spherical but adopt a flat (disk-like) structure on the charged surface because of the strong interaction between the protein and the surface. In addition to the 5.5-nm high disk-shaped aggregates, small spheres of about 2-nm diameter are seen in the background starting at around 12 h (Fig. 1). It is possible that these are present at earlier times but not visible in the AFM image because of the much greater height of the amorphous aggregates. The size of these small species is in the range expected for native monomers of SMA (4.0 × 2.8 × 1.3 nm) or dimers. It is likely that these are not in the native conformation because of interactions with the surface. The number of these small spheres increased with increasing incubation time, suggesting increasing numbers of tightly adsorbed monomer/dimers with time and that they may be too tightly bound to participate in aggregation and fibrillation, i.e. the off-rate is very slow. The 5.5-nm oligomeric aggregation units appear to serve as the building blocks for the formation of protofibrils, which grow from a single aggregation building block of SMA over a time of ≈45 h (Fig. 1, C and D). We use the termprotofibril rather than protofilament because the size and morphology resemble the protofibrils observed in solution (7Ionescu-Zanetti C. Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Petrick J.S. Trabachino L.C. Minert L.J. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13175-13179Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A significant increase in the number of large (longer) aggregated species was observed from 36 to 45 h. The length of linear aggregates was typically between 18 and 400 nm. The larger ones were exactly integer multiples of the size of the oligomeric building block units, composed of 2–8 such units, and retained a basically constant height and width (Table I). These observations suggest that the aggregation building block unit is the basic unit of fibrillar assembly on the mica surface, and we will call this process fibril assembly mechanism 2. These individual units then assembled by linear association to produce the protofibrils in the presence of excess single units (Fig. 1 D). Small numbers of single units fusing together are shown in Fig. 4. The growth of protofibrils was bidirectional and linear, and no branched aggregates were observed. Protofibrils were already growing from the amorphous core by 10 h (fibril assembly mechanism 1), a shorter time than that required for linear protofibril formation (fibril assembly mechanism 2). At 16 h the presence of various aggregated"

Previous studies have shown that DEC1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is induced by hypoxia in glioma cells (Ivanova, A. V., Ivanov, S. V., Danilkovitch-Miagkova, A., and Lerman, M. I. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 15306–15315). In the present study, we found that hypoxia or CoCl2 enhanced the mRNA expression of DEC2, as well as DEC1, within 24 h in chondrogenic ATDC5, 293T, and HeLa cells. In luciferase assays, the regions between −524 and −401 in the DEC1 promoter, and between −863 and −258 in the DEC2 promoter, were responsible for the hypoxia- or hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)-induced transcription. In these regions, we identified functional hypoxia response elements (HREs) that bound to HIF-1α and HIF-1β. In addition to an HIF-1 binding site consensus sequence, the DEC1 HRE had cAMP response element-like and CACAG sequences, which were also involved in the transcription activation in response to HIF-1α. Although the DEC2 HRE did not have a cAMP response element-like or CACAG sequence, it showed a higher affinity for HIF-1 than did the DEC1 HRE. Because DEC1 and DEC2 are directly inducible by HIF-1, these transcription factors may be crucial for the adaptation to hypoxia.

A mouse ortholog (Stra13) and a rat ortholog (SHARP-2) of DEC1 were identified independently by others in the P19 embryonal carcinoma cells and rat brain, respectively (2Boudjelal M. Taneja R.

In addition, we cloned a member of the DEC subfamily of bHLH proteins, DEC2 (BHLHB3), by searching the expressed sequence tags data bank (4Fujimoto K. Shen M. Noshiro M. Matsubara K. Shingu S. Honda K. Yoshida E. Suardita K. Matsuda Y. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 164-171Google Scholar). DEC2 is similar to SHARP-1 (3Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Google Scholar), which is a truncated molecule of DEC2 produced by a sequencing error or a minor frameshift mutant (4Fujimoto K. Shen M. Noshiro M. Matsubara K. Shingu S. Honda K. Yoshida E. Suardita K. Matsuda Y. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 164-171Google Scholar). The bHLH regions of DEC1 and DEC2 exhibit the highest similarities to those ofDrosophila Hairy, Enhancer of split and mammal HES, which are known as transcriptional repressors with the WRPW motif, which interacts with the Groucho family members of corepressors. Although the Stra13/DEC1 and DEC2/SHARP-1 lack the WRPW motif, they also act as transcriptional repressors by a discrete mechanism (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stra13/DEC1 interacts physically with the components of the basal transcription machineries, such as TATA-binding protein and TFIIB, and can recruit the histone deacetylase 1-Sin3A-NcoR corepressor complex through their carboxyl-terminal repression domain (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, Stra13-deficient mice were generated, and it was shown that Stra13/DEC1 is a key regulator of lymphocyte activation that is vital for the maintenance of self-tolerance and constraint of autoimmunity. Other phenotypic differences between Stra13−/− mutants and the wild-type littermates have not been reported (7Sun H. Lu B. Li R.Q. Flavell R.A. Taneja R. Nat.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14821-14888Google Scholar). The mRNA of DEC2 was expressed ubiquitously, but the expression level of DEC2 was more variable tissue-dependently than that of DEC1 (4Fujimoto K. Shen M. Noshiro M. Matsubara K. Shingu S. Honda K. Yoshida E. Suardita K. Matsuda Y. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 164-171Google Scholar). The role of DEC2 in vivo is not known.The transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), functions as a global regulator of O2 homeostasis and the adaptation to O2 deprivation (8Semenza G.L.

Under normoxic conditions, the HIF-1α is subjected to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by the interaction with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) (9Huang L.E. Gu J.

A recent study (19Ivanova A.V. Ivanov S.V. Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Lerman M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15306-15315Google Scholar) showed that DEC1 was down-regulated by pVHL and that the expression of DEC1 mRNA in glioma cells was hypoxia-sensitive. Although the pVHL/HIF-1 pathway described above was thought to regulate the expression of DEC1 mRNA under hypoxic conditions, the underlying mechanism has not been dissected fully, and the relation between hypoxia and the DEC2 mRNA expression has not yet been investigated.In this study, we examined the effects of hypoxia on the DEC2 and DEC1 mRNA expression in chondrogenic ATDC5, 293T, and HeLa cells. Because the DEC2 and DEC1 mRNA expression was induced by CoCl2 mimicking the hypoxic condition in ATDC5 cells and by hypoxia in 293T and HeLa cells, we investigated the transcriptional activities of the 5′-flanking regions in these genes. We determined the HRE in the DEC1 and DEC2 promoters and found that the DEC1 and DEC2 genes are direct targets of HIF-1.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we found that, like DEC1, DEC2 is induced by hypoxia on the transcriptional level, and we revealed the underlying molecular mechanism by identifying the functional HIF-1 binding sites in the DEC1 and DEC2 promoters. Recent studies with cartilage-specific HIF-1α-deficient mice have shown that internal chondrocytes of the growth plate cartilage are under hypoxic conditions and that HIF-1α is essential for survival of the hypoxic chondrocytes and further, for the induction of growth arrest of the chondrocytes before hypertrophic differentiation (32Schipani E. Ryan H.E. Didrickson S. Kobayashi T. Knight M. Johnson R.S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2865-2876Crossref Google Scholar). The lack of HIF-1α in the chondrocytes caused a massive cell death in the center of the cartilaginous elements and a subtle delay in the process of the hypertrophic differentiation at its periphery because of the lack of growth arrest. In the mutant mice, the expression of type II and type X collagens was absent in the central portion of the proliferative and the upper hypertrophic zones in the growth plate, suggesting the requirement of HIF-1α for the expression of the cartilage-specific collagens. In the present study, the treatment for 24 h with CoCl2 mimicking a hypoxic condition had little effect on type II collagen, aggrecan, or type X collagen mRNA expression in the chondrogenic ATDC5 cell cultures (Fig. 1 A). 24 h of exposure to CoCl2 might be too brief to detect the effect of CoCl2 on the expression of these genes. On the other hand, the mRNA expression of DEC2 and DEC1 was enhanced by CoCl2 within 24 h throughout all of the stages of the chondrocyte differentiation. The reason for the enhancement by CoCl2 within 24 h is thought to be that the DEC2 and DEC1 gene expression is regulated directly by HIF-1.Because the DEC1 and DEC2 modulate transcription of various genes (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Google Scholar,6Garriga-Canut M. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14821-14888Google Scholar, 33Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Google Scholar), DEC1 and DEC2 could be involved in the adaptation of chondrocytes to hypoxic conditions. DEC1 and DEC2 may also affect the expression of regulatory molecules involved in growth arrest, and the Stra13/DEC1 overexpression did indeed suppress the proliferation of the NIH3T3 cells (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Google Scholar). The up-regulation of the Stra13/DEC1 expression was concomitant with the down-regulation of the cell proliferation-associated protein c-Myc expression levels in the NIH3T3 cells, and the Stra13/DEC1 expression strongly inhibited the promoter activity of the c-Myc gene (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Google Scholar).Recent studies have shown that hypoxia inhibits adipogenesis and the expression of a key transcription factor in adipogenesis, PPARγ2, via HIF-1, and that the DEC1 overexpression inhibits the PPARγ2 gene expression (33Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Google Scholar). Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate to chondryocytes, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and myoblasts, and an overexpression of DEC1 in mesenchymal stem cells promoted chondrogenic differentiation.2 Therefore, DEC1 induced by hypoxia may promote chondrogenesis by inhibiting mesenchymal stem cells from going to some other lineage, such as the adipogenic lineage.We demonstrated here that the gene expression of DEC1 and DEC2 is regulated by the HIF-1 binding to the functional HBSs in their promoters under hypoxic conditions. An HBS consensus sequence 5′-RCGTG-3′ exists in the hypoxia response region of the DEC1 promoter (DEC1-HBS), and two consensus sequences exist in that of the DEC2 promoter (DEC2-HBS1 and -HBS2) (Fig 4 A). However, only DEC1-HBS and DEC2-HBS1 were functional in the luciferase reporter gene assays. In the DEC1, but not the DEC2 promoter, we found a CRE-like sequence adjacent to the functional HBS (Fig. 4 B). In the LDH-A promoter, a multiprotein complex of HIF-1, CREB-1/ATF-1, and p300/CREB-binding protein bound to the HRE under hypoxic conditions (34Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4089-4096Google Scholar). The complex formation of HIF-1, CREB-1, and p300 was necessary to induce the hypoxic response in the LDH-A gene (34Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4089-4096Google Scholar). As to the HRE containing the functional HBS in the DEC1 gene, the results obtained with various mutated HRE sequences showed that a disruption of the CRE-like sequence alone did not abolish the induction by HIF-1α, although it decreased the basal luciferase activity. On the other hand, the mutations of the overlapping nucleotides between the CRE-like and the CACAG sequences decreased the basal luciferase activity and almost abolished the induction. These findings suggest that the CRE-like sequence is required for the maintenance of the transcription in the absence and presence of HIF-1 and that both of the CRE-like sequence and the CACAG sequence may be required for the induction in response to hypoxia. In the supershift assays, we could not detect a supershift of the mobility of the DEC1-HREwt probe and HIF-1 complex using these antibodies, suggesting that this complex did not contain CREB-1 or ATF-1 (Fig. 5 B). Although CREB-1 or ATF-1 may bind to the CRE-like sequence of DEC1-HRE, no CREB-1·DNA or ATF-1·DNA complex was detected under these conditions. However, CREB-1 or ATF-1 could bind to DEC1-HRE with a very low affinity. The CRE-like sequence (TGGAGTCA) in DEC1-HRE differs from that in the HRE of the LDH-A gene. This may explain the low affinity of CREB-1 or ATF-1 for the sequence. In any case, the requirement of the CRE-like or CACAG sequence for the response to HIF-1 in DEC1-HRE is consistent with the previous findings that the LDH-A and Epo promoters require the CRE and CACAG sequences, respectively, to respond to hypoxia or HIF-1 (31Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21021-21027Google Scholar, 35Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). In the HRE of the human transferrin receptor gene, a CRE-like sequence overlaps with the CACAG sequence. However, the contribution of these sequences to the HIF-1 induction has not been determined (25Lok C.N. Ponka P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24147-24152Google Scholar). We found that DEC2-HRE has a higher affinity for HIF-1 than DEC1-HRE. DEC2-HRE may not require a CRE or CACAG sequence because of the higher affinity for HIF-1.The protein products of genes up-regulated by HIF-1 play key roles in angiogenesis, vascular reactivity and remodeling, glucose and energy metabolism, proliferation, survival, erythropoiesis, and iron homeostasis (36Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Google Scholar). Interestingly, DEC1 and DEC2 are inducible by HIF-1 within 24 h in various cells. There have been few studies on the action of HIF-1 on transcription factors; HIF-1 enhanced transcription from the Ets promoter (37Oikawa M. Abe M. Kurosawa H. Hida W. Shirato K. Sato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 39-43Google Scholar). DEC1 and DEC2 may suppress the expression of some genes under hypoxic conditions, because they work as the transcriptional suppressors in vitro (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Google Scholar, 6Garriga-Canut M. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14821-14888Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the oncodevelopmental α-fetoprotein gene expression is repressed by hypoxia in hepatoma cells and that the repression is regulated by HIF-1 via the HRE containing a CACGTG sequence in the α-fetoprotein promoter (38Mazure N.M. Chauvet C. Bois-Joyeux B. Bernard M.A. Nacer-Cherif H. Danan J.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1158-1165Google Scholar). However, HIF-1 did not bind to this sequence. The CACGTG sequence is the classical E-box sequence, and the human DEC1 can bind to it (39Zawel L. Yu J. Torrance C.J. Markowitz S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2848-2853Google Scholar). Other researchers have reported that the hypoxia-mimicking agent CoCl2down-regulated the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 via the classical E-box (40Lee S.G. Lee H. Rho H.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 259-263Google Scholar). In another study, we observed that DEC1 and DEC2 bound to the classical E-box by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. 3Kawamoto, T., et. al., manuscript in preparation. These observations raise the possibility that DEC1 and DEC2, induced by HIF-1, inhibit the transcription of genes reported to be down-regulated by hypoxia, such as the PPARγ2, α-fetoprotein, and p53 genes via the E-box (33Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Google Scholar, 38Mazure N.M. Chauvet C. Bois-Joyeux B. Bernard M.A. Nacer-Cherif H. Danan J.L.

Identification of the target genes for DEC1 and DEC2 should provide important insights into the molecular mechanism for the responses to hypoxia under physiological and pathological conditions. Recently we cloned the cDNA for the novel basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; HBS, HIF-1 binding site; HRE, hypoxia response element; CRE, cAMP response element; PPARγ2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2; RT, reverse transcriptase; wt, wild-type; CREB, CRE-binding protein; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; Epo, erythropoeitin; TK, thymidine kinase 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; HBS, HIF-1 binding site; HRE, hypoxia response element; CRE, cAMP response element; PPARγ2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2; RT, reverse transcriptase; wt, wild-type; CREB, CRE-binding protein; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; Epo, erythropoeitin; TK, thymidine kinase transcription factor DEC1 (BHLHB2), which was expressed at a higher level in human primary chondrocytes than in fibroblastic cells (1Shen M. Kawamoto T. Yan W. Nakamasu K. Tamagami M. Koyano Y. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 294-298Google Scholar). A mouse ortholog (Stra13) and a rat ortholog (SHARP-2) of DEC1 were identified independently by others in the P19 embryonal carcinoma cells and rat brain, respectively (2Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Google Scholar, 3Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Google Scholar), and the mRNA of DEC1 was found in a variety of embryonic and adult tissues (1Shen M. Kawamoto T. Yan W. Nakamasu K. Tamagami M. Koyano Y. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 294-298Google Scholar, 2Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Google Scholar, 3Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Google Scholar). In addition, we cloned a member of the DEC subfamily of bHLH proteins, DEC2 (BHLHB3), by searching the expressed sequence tags data bank (4Fujimoto K. Shen M. Noshiro M. Matsubara K. Shingu S. Honda K. Yoshida E. Suardita K. Matsuda Y. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 164-171Google Scholar). DEC2 is similar to SHARP-1 (3Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Google Scholar), which is a truncated molecule of DEC2 produced by a sequencing error or a minor frameshift mutant (4Fujimoto K. Shen M. Noshiro M. Matsubara K. Shingu S. Honda K. Yoshida E. Suardita K. Matsuda Y. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 164-171Google Scholar). The bHLH regions of DEC1 and DEC2 exhibit the highest similarities to those ofDrosophila Hairy, Enhancer of split and mammal HES, which are known as transcriptional repressors with the WRPW motif, which interacts with the Groucho family members of corepressors. Although the Stra13/DEC1 and DEC2/SHARP-1 lack the WRPW motif, they also act as transcriptional repressors by a discrete mechanism (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Google Scholar, 6Garriga-Canut M. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14821-14888Google Scholar). Stra13/DEC1 interacts physically with the components of the basal transcription machineries, such as TATA-binding protein and TFIIB, and can recruit the histone deacetylase 1-Sin3A-NcoR corepressor complex through their carboxyl-terminal repression domain (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Google Scholar). DEC1/Stra13/SHARP-2 may be involved in the control of the proliferation and/or differentiation of chondrocytes, nerve cells, fibroblasts, and T cells (1Shen M. Kawamoto T. Yan W. Nakamasu K. Tamagami M. Koyano Y. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 294-298Google Scholar, 2Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P.

Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1040-1047Google Scholar). The overexpression of DEC1/Stra13 promoted a chondrogenic differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells, 2M. Shen, E. Yoshida, W. Yan, T. Kawamoto, K. Suardita, Y. Koyano, K. Fujimoto, M. Noshiro, and Y. Kato, manuscript in preparation.2M. Shen, E. Yoshida, W. Yan, T. Kawamoto, K. Suardita, Y. Koyano, K. Fujimoto, M. Noshiro, and Y. Kato, manuscript in preparation. and a neural differentiation of the P19 cells (2Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Google Scholar). Recently, Stra13-deficient mice were generated, and it was shown that Stra13/DEC1 is a key regulator of lymphocyte activation that is vital for the maintenance of self-tolerance and constraint of autoimmunity. Other phenotypic differences between Stra13−/− mutants and the wild-type littermates have not been reported (7Sun H. Lu B. Li R.Q. Flavell R.A. Taneja R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1040-1047Google Scholar). On the other hand, DEC2/SHARP-1 worked as a transcriptional repressor in vitro (6Garriga-Canut M. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14821-14888Google Scholar). The mRNA of DEC2 was expressed ubiquitously, but the expression level of DEC2 was more variable tissue-dependently than that of DEC1 (4Fujimoto K. Shen M. Noshiro M. Matsubara K. Shingu S. Honda K. Yoshida E. Suardita K. Matsuda Y. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 164-171Google Scholar). The role of DEC2 in vivo is not known. The transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), functions as a global regulator of O2 homeostasis and the adaptation to O2 deprivation (8Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits, both of which are bHLH-PAS (Per/Arnt/Sim) proteins. Under normoxic conditions, the HIF-1α is subjected to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by the interaction with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) (9Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Google Scholar, 10Kallio P.J. Wilson W.J. O'Brien S. Makino Y. Poellinger L. J. Biol.

Under hypoxic conditions, the HIF-1α is released from pVHL and translocates into the nucleus, where it heterodimerizes with HIF-1β, which is expressed constitutively (11Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Google Scholar, 12Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The HIF-1 complex binds to the HIF-1 binding site (HBS) in the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the hypoxia-inducible target genes, such as erythropoeitin (14Jiang B.H. Rue E. Wang G.L. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17771-17778Google Scholar), transferrin (15Rolfs A. Kvietikova I. Gassmann M. Wenger R.H. J. Biol.

On the other hand, the mutations of the overlapping nucleotides between the CRE-like and the CACAG sequences decreased the basal luciferase activity and almost abolished the induction. These findings suggest that the CRE-like sequence is required for the maintenance of the transcription in the absence and presence of HIF-1 and that both of the CRE-like sequence and the CACAG sequence may be required for the induction in response to hypoxia. In the supershift assays, we could not detect a supershift of the mobility of the DEC1-HREwt probe and HIF-1 complex using these antibodies, suggesting that this complex did not contain CREB-1 or ATF-1 (Fig. 5 B). Although CREB-1 or ATF-1 may bind to the CRE-like sequence of DEC1-HRE, no CREB-1·DNA or ATF-1·DNA complex was detected under these conditions. However, CREB-1 or ATF-1 could bind to DEC1-HRE with a very low affinity. The CRE-like sequence (TGGAGTCA) in DEC1-HRE differs from that in the HRE of the LDH-A gene. This may explain the low affinity of CREB-1 or ATF-1 for the sequence. In any case, the requirement of the CRE-like or CACAG sequence for the response to HIF-1 in DEC1-HRE is consistent with the previous findings that the LDH-A and Epo promoters require the CRE and CACAG sequences, respectively, to respond to hypoxia or HIF-1 (31Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21021-21027Google Scholar, 35Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). In the HRE of the human transferrin receptor gene, a CRE-like sequence overlaps with the CACAG sequence. However, the contribution of these sequences to the HIF-1 induction has not been determined (25Lok C.N. Ponka P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24147-24152Google Scholar). We found that DEC2-HRE has a higher affinity for HIF-1 than DEC1-HRE. DEC2-HRE may not require a CRE or CACAG sequence because of the higher affinity for HIF-1.The protein products of genes up-regulated by HIF-1 play key roles in angiogenesis, vascular reactivity and remodeling, glucose and energy metabolism, proliferation, survival, erythropoiesis, and iron homeostasis (36Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Google Scholar). Interestingly, DEC1 and DEC2 are inducible by HIF-1 within 24 h in various cells. There have been few studies on the action of HIF-1 on transcription factors; HIF-1 enhanced transcription from the Ets promoter (37Oikawa M. Abe M. Kurosawa H. Hida W. Shirato K. Sato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 39-43Google Scholar). DEC1 and DEC2 may suppress the expression of some genes under hypoxic conditions, because they work as the transcriptional suppressors in vitro (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Google Scholar, 6Garriga-Canut M. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14821-14888Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the oncodevelopmental α-fetoprotein gene expression is repressed by hypoxia in hepatoma cells and that the repression is regulated by HIF-1 via the HRE containing a CACGTG sequence in the α-fetoprotein promoter (38Mazure N.M. Chauvet C. Bois-Joyeux B. Bernard M.A. Nacer-Cherif H. Danan J.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1158-1165Google Scholar). However, HIF-1 did not bind to this sequence. The CACGTG sequence is the classical E-box sequence, and the human DEC1 can bind to it (39Zawel L. Yu J. Torrance C.J. Markowitz S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2848-2853Google Scholar). Other researchers have reported that the hypoxia-mimicking agent CoCl2down-regulated the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 via the classical E-box (40Lee S.G. Lee H. Rho H.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 259-263Google Scholar). In another study, we observed that DEC1 and DEC2 bound to the classical E-box by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. 3Kawamoto, T., et. al., manuscript in preparation. These observations raise the possibility that DEC1 and DEC2, induced by HIF-1, inhibit the transcription of genes reported to be down-regulated by hypoxia, such as the PPARγ2, α-fetoprotein, and p53 genes via the E-box (33Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Google Scholar, 38Mazure N.M. Chauvet C. Bois-Joyeux B. Bernard M.A. Nacer-Cherif H. Danan J.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1158-1165Google Scholar,40Lee S.G. Lee H. Rho H.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 259-263Google Scholar). Identification of the target genes for DEC1 and DEC2 should provide important insights into the molecular mechanism for the responses to hypoxia under physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we found that, like DEC1, DEC2 is induced by hypoxia on the transcriptional level, and we revealed the underlying molecular mechanism by identifying the functional HIF-1 binding sites in the DEC1 and DEC2 promoters. Recent studies with cartilage-specific HIF-1α-deficient mice have shown that internal chondrocytes of the growth plate cartilage are under hypoxic conditions and that HIF-1α is essential for survival of the hypoxic chondrocytes and further, for the induction of growth arrest of the chondrocytes before hypertrophic differentiation (32Schipani E. Ryan H.E. Didrickson S. Kobayashi T. Knight M. Johnson R.S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2865-2876Crossref Google Scholar). The lack of HIF-1α in the chondrocytes caused a massive cell death in the center of the cartilaginous elements and a subtle delay in the process of the hypertrophic differentiation at its periphery because of the lack of growth arrest. In the mutant mice, the expression of type II and type X collagens was absent in the central portion of the proliferative and the upper hypertrophic zones in the growth plate, suggesting the requirement of HIF-1α for the expression of the cartilage-specific collagens. In the present study, the treatment for 24 h with CoCl2 mimicking a hypoxic condition had little effect on type II collagen, aggrecan, or type X collagen mRNA expression in the chondrogenic ATDC5 cell cultures (Fig. 1 A). 24 h of exposure to CoCl2 might be too brief to detect the effect of CoCl2 on the expression of these genes. On the other hand, the mRNA expression of DEC2 and DEC1 was enhanced by CoCl2 within 24 h throughout all of the stages of the chondrocyte differentiation. The reason for the enhancement by CoCl2 within 24 h is thought to be that the DEC2 and DEC1 gene expression is regulated directly by HIF-1. Because the DEC1 and DEC2 modulate transcription of various genes (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Google Scholar,6Garriga-Canut M. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14821-14888Google Scholar, 33Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Google Scholar), DEC1 and DEC2 could be involved in the adaptation of chondrocytes to hypoxic conditions. DEC1 and DEC2 may also affect the expression of regulatory molecules involved in growth arrest, and the Stra13/DEC1 overexpression did indeed suppress the proliferation of the NIH3T3 cells (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Google Scholar). The up-regulation of the Stra13/DEC1 expression was concomitant with the down-regulation of the cell proliferation-associated protein c-Myc expression levels in the NIH3T3 cells, and the Stra13/DEC1 expression strongly inhibited the promoter activity of the c-Myc gene (5Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that hypoxia inhibits adipogenesis and the expression of a key transcription factor in adipogenesis, PPARγ2, via HIF-1, and that the DEC1 overexpression inhibits the PPARγ2 gene expression (33Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Google Scholar). Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate to chondryocytes, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and myoblasts, and an overexpression of DEC1 in mesenchymal stem cells promoted chondrogenic differentiation.2 Therefore, DEC1 induced by hypoxia may promote chondrogenesis by inhibiting mesenchymal stem cells from going to some other lineage, such as the adipogenic lineage. We demonstrated here that the gene expression of DEC1 and DEC2 is regulated by the HIF-1 binding to the functional HBSs in their promoters under hypoxic conditions. An HBS consensus sequence 5′-RCGTG-3′ exists in the hypoxia response region of the DEC1 promoter (DEC1-HBS), and two consensus sequences exist in that of the DEC2 promoter (DEC2-HBS1 and -HBS2) (Fig 4 A). However, only DEC1-HBS and DEC2-HBS1 were functional in the luciferase reporter gene assays. In the DEC1, but not the DEC2 promoter, we found a CRE-like sequence adjacent to the functional HBS (Fig. 4 B). In the LDH-A promoter, a multiprotein complex of HIF-1, CREB-1/ATF-1, and p300/CREB-binding protein bound to the HRE under hypoxic conditions (34Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4089-4096Google Scholar). The complex formation of HIF-1, CREB-1, and p300 was necessary to induce the hypoxic response in the LDH-A gene (34Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4089-4096Google Scholar). As to the HRE containing the functional HBS in the DEC1 gene, the results obtained with various mutated HRE sequences showed that a disruption of the CRE-like sequence alone did not abolish the induction by HIF-1α, although it decreased the basal luciferase activity. On the other hand, the mutations of the overlapping nucleotides between the CRE-like and the CACAG sequences decreased the basal luciferase activity and almost abolished the induction.

https://openalex.org/W2116638233,"The hepatic drug-metabolizing cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes are down-regulated during inflammation. In vitro studies with hepatocytes have shown that the cytokines released during inflammatory responses are largely responsible for this CYP repression. However, the signaling pathways and the cytokine-activated factors involved remain to be properly identified. Our research has focused on the negative regulation of CYP3A4 (the major drug-metabolizing human CYP) by interleukin 6 (IL-6) (the principal regulator of the hepatic acute-phase response). CYP3A4 down-regulation by IL-6 requires activation of the glycoprotein receptor gp130; however, it does not proceed through the JAK/STAT pathway, as demonstrated by the overexpression of a dominant-negative STAT3 factor by means of an adenoviral vector. The involvement of IL-6-activated kinases such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1/2 or p38 is also unlikely, as evidenced by the use of specific chemical inhibitors. It is noteworthy that IL-6 caused a moderated induction in the mRNA of the transcription factor C/EBPbeta (CCAAT-enhancer binding protein beta) and a marked increase in the translation of C/EBPbeta-LIP, a 20-kDa C/EBPbeta isoform lacking a transactivation domain. Adenovirus-mediated expression of C/EBPbeta-LIP caused a dose-dependent repression of CYP3A4 mRNA, whereas overexpression C/EBPalpha and C/EBPb-LAP (35 kDa) caused a significant induction. Our results support the idea that IL-6 down-regulates CYP3A4 through translational induction of C/EBPbeta-LIP, which competes with and antagonizes constitutive C/EBP transactivators. From a clinical point of view, these findings could be relevant in the development of therapeutic cytokines with a less repressive effect on hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes."

Biglycan showed a unique ability to organize collagen VI into extensive hexagonal-like networks over a time period of only a few minutes. Only the intact molecule, substituted with two dermatan sulfate chains, had this capacity. Intact decorin, with one dermatan sulfate chain only, was considerably less efficient, and aggregates of organized collagen VI were found only after several hours. Chondroadherin without glycosaminoglycan substitutions did not induce any ordered collagen VI organization. However, all three related LRR proteins were shown to interact with collagen VI using electron microscopy and surface plasmon resonance. Biglycan and decorin were exclusively found close to the N-terminal parts of the collagen VI tetramers, whereas chondroadherin was shown to bind close to both the N- and C-terminal parts of collagen VI. In the formed hexagonal networks, biglycan was localized to the intra-network junctions of the collagen VI filaments.

Collagen VI is unique among the collagens in its molecular and fibrillar arrangement. The monomer consists of three genetically distinct peptide chains (α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI)) that form a triple helical, central domain, flanked by two globular domains at the N and C termini. The N-terminal globular domain is larger than the C-terminal domain and consists almost exclusively of the α3(VI) chain, which has nearly twice the mass of the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains (1Kielty C.M.

Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 208-242Google Scholar). Collagen VI monomers assemble intracellularly into disulfide-bonded tetramers that are secreted into the extracellular matrix (3Engvall E. Hessle H. Klier G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). There they assemble in a characteristic end-to-end fashion into thin (3–10 nm) beaded filaments as well as hexagonal networks (4Bruns R.R. Press W. Engvall E. Timpl R. Gross J. J.

Biochem. 1984; 142: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). When collagen VI is isolated by pepsin digestion, most of the N- and C-terminal domains are cleaved off, leaving the triple helical region with minor parts of the globular domains of the collagen VI molecules, which is still sufficient for forming the tetramer (6Furthmayr H.

Thus, the small LRR-proteoglycans have important roles in controlling the extracellular matrix modeling and remodeling in connective tissues. In this investigation we addressed the role of selected LRR proteins/proteoglycans in the control of collagen VI network formationin vitro. We show a novel role for biglycan in supramolecular organization of collagen VI into hexagonal-like networks resembling those found in some tissues. Collagen VI was prepared from placenta after pepsin digestion (35Odermatt E. Risteli J. van Delden V. Timpl R. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In short, human placenta was homogenized in formic acid and incubated with pepsin for 24 h at room temperature. After a series of salt precipitations, the collagen VI was purified on an agarose A5m column, dialyzed into dilute acetic acid, and freeze-dried. Intact collagen VI was purified from bovine cornea (36Spissinger T. Engel J. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In short, bovine corneas were cut into pieces and homogenized in Tris/saline buffer containing 5 mm calcium chloride and protease inhibitors. The homogenate was digested with collagenase type 1 (Worthington biochemical corporation, Lakewood, NJ). Non-dissolved material was pelleted by centrifugation at 48,000 × gfor 20 min. The supernatant was applied in 500-μl aliquots onto a Superose 6 column of 25 ml (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated and eluted with homogenization buffer at 0.2 ml/minute. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and those containing collagen VI were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.0, and then dialyzed back into Tris/saline buffer to depolymerize the collagen VI microfibrils. Collagen VI tetramers were separated from larger aggregates by a second gel filtration on the Superose 6 column as described. Human biglycan (37Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cDNA and bovine decorin (38Day A.A. McQuillan C.I. Termine J.D. Young M.R. Biochem.

Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Medium was collected, and small proteoglycans were purified by ion exchange chromatography and purified from traces of bovine serum albumin on Blue Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (22Wiberg C. Hedbom E. Khairullina A. Lamandé S.R. Oldberg Å. Timpl R. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18947-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recombinant chondroadherin was expressed in human kidney cells constitutively expressing EBNA-1 protein from Epstein-Barr virus (293 EBNA). Collected medium from the cultured cells was applied onto a CM-52 column, and proteins were eluted with a sodium chloride gradient (40Månsson B. Wenglén C. Mörgelin M. Saxne T. Heinegård D. J.

The sample was diluted into 2 m guanidine hydrochloride and digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) for 24 h at 37 °C. The digest was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and applied onto a 5-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (AmershamBiosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in the same buffer. The peptide fragment carrying two glycosaminoglycan chains was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m sodium chloride in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, dialyzed against water, and frozen. Biglycan was diluted in TBS to a final concentration of 400 nm, and 50 milliunits/ml chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was added. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 0.5–2 h with the progress of the digestion monitored at 232 nm. Digestion was further checked by the appearance of core protein visualized by SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, digestion with chondroitinase ABC of pre-formed collagen VI/biglycan networks (described below) were done overnight at room temperature with chondroitinase ABC at the same enzyme to substrate ratio as described above. Pepsin extracted collagen VI (200 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.2) was covalently immobilized on the BIAcore Sensorchip CM-5 (carboxylated dextran matrix) with a 1:1 mixture of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide andN-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie Gmbh, Steinheim, Germany) according to the description of the manufacturer. Remaining active groups on the matrix were blocked with 1 methanolamine-HCl (BDH Chemicals, Poole, UK) at pH 8.5. The running buffer was 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Studies of interactions were performed in TBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% surfactant P20. LRR proteins/proteoglycans (100–200 nm) were injected over immobilized collagen VI at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Individual experiments were performed between five and ten times. Colloidal gold particles of 4 nm ± 15% were prepared by reduction of HAuCl4 by thiocyanate (43Baschong W. Lucocq J.M. Roth J. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and, after titration, conjugated to purified, recombinant biglycan, decorin, and chondroadherin as described previously (44Baschong W. Wrigley N.G. J. Electron Microsc. Tech. 1990; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Gold-labeled LRR proteins/proteoglycans (at 20 nm) were mixed with intact collagen VI from bovine cornea in TBS, and the mixture was instantly adsorbed onto a 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grid, which was rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. The grid was immediately blotted, briefly washed with 2 drops of water, and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate for 15 s. Specimens were studied in a Jeol 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 60-kV accelerating voltage and ×75,000 magnification. Small LRR proteins/proteoglycans (at 20–30 nm) or a trypsin fragment of biglycan containing a short peptide with the two glycosaminoglycan substituents (at 10–80 nm) were incubated at room temperature for 5 min and 18 h, respectively, with collagen VI (at 20 nm) in TBS. Samples were immediately taken to negative staining for electron microscopy as described above. For localization of biglycan in complexes with collagen VI, colloidal gold particles were prepared and conjugated to purified, recombinant biglycan as described above. The preparation was then incubated with collagen VI overnight at room temperature before negative staining and analysis by electron microscopy. For kinetic studies of network formation, recombinant biglycan or decorin (at 20 nm) were incubated with collagen VI (at 20 nm) at room temperature for periods from 5 min up to 24 h. As the starting point (time = 0), samples were taken to negative staining immediately after mixing of the collagen VI with the proteoglycan. Collagen VI network formation was monitored by using Digital Micrograph 3.2 (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA) to measure the surface area confined by the outer edges of networks formed at different time points. The mean surface area of the networks formed by collagen VI incubated with biglycan at time = 0 were set as a reference value to normalize the measurements. This approach was also used to evaluate the mean surface area of collagen VI/biglycan networks formed when different concentrations of recombinant biglycan (1–150 nm) were incubated with 20 nm of collagen VI for 1 h at +4 °C. Experiments aimed at inhibiting network formation by isolated structures of biglycan were performed by adding a peptide fragment carrying the two glycosaminoglycan chains purified from biglycan after trypsin digestion or alternatively biglycan core protein. The putative inhibitors were added either before or after formation of the collagen VI networks. Either inhibitor was added to 15–300 nm with intact biglycan at 30 nm and collagen VI at 20 nm. Six different batches of freshly prepared colloidal gold were in total used in the electron microscopy experiments. For quantitative evaluations, some 300 particles of gold-labeled biglycan, decorin, or chondroadherin in complex with collagen VI (see Fig. 1), and between 300 and 500 reconstituted collagen VI networks (see Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6), were analyzed. Experiments were performed between five and ten times and did not show significant individual variations with respect to relative numbers of interacting particles and collagen VI network areas.Figure 6Collagen VI network growth is accelerated by biglycan as compared with decorin. Intact biglycan (●) and decorin (▴) (at 20 nm) were allowed to interact with collagen VI (at 20 nm) in TBS at room temperature. Samples were negatively stained with 0.75% uranyl formate after different incubation times and taken for electron microscopy. The surface areas of the negatively stained networks were measured, and the mean surface area was normalized and plotted against time. Biglycan efficiently induced the formation of collagen VI networks. Already after 5 min, most of the collagen VI was found in large networks with a surface area of several square microns. Even after 6 h, decorin had induced little network formation, although after 24 h the effect approached that of biglycan.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Collagen VI network formation requires intact LRR-proteoglycans substituted with glycosaminoglycan chains.Collagen VI was incubated for 5 min (left panel) or 18 h (right panel) at room temperature in TBS together with intact biglycan (Bgn), intact decorin (Dcn), biglycan core protein (Bgn-core), chondroadherin (CHAD), at molar ratios of 1:1, or without any LRR protein (−). Intact biglycan induced rapid formation of hexagonal-like networks, extending over several micrometers, as visualized by negative staining electron microscopy. Collagen VI incubated with biglycan core protein, chondroadherin, or incubated without any LRR protein formed only small aggregates lacking apparent organization even after 18 h. Incubation with decorin also resulted in the formation of organized networks, albeit the process was very slow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Biglycan induces formation of extended collagen VI networks in a concentration-dependent manner.

The surface areas of the negatively stained networks were measured, and the mean surface area was normalized and plotted against the biglycan concentration. a, at molar ratios above 3:4 (biglycan:collagen VI) the mean surface area of the collagen VI networks formed was not significantly changed upon further addition of biglycan. b, comparison of the collagen VI network formation with added gold-labeled and non-labeled biglycan at low concentrations showed that labeling did not influence the concentration dependence of network growth.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Biglycan is localized to intra-network junctions in the formed collagen VI network.

Biglycan binds to the intra-network junctions, which corresponds to the N-terminal parts of the aggregated collagen VI (arrowheads). The bar represents 100 nm. Theinset shows a magnified junction of the collagen VI network, to which biglycan localizes. b, the number of gold-labeled biglycan bound in the collagen VI network junctions approaches saturation at biglycan concentrations of 5 nm, which corresponds to a molar ratio of 1:4 (biglycan:collagen VI).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Biglycan induces formation of extended collagen VI networks. Biglycan (at 20 nm) was incubated with intact (a) or pepsin-treated (b) collagen VI (at 20 nm) at room temperature and then negatively stained for electron microscopy. Extended networks of collagen VI that covered several square microns were formed within a few minutes. There was no difference in appearance between the intact and pepsin-treated collagen VI. The bar represents 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immobilization of collagen VI resulted in surface concentrations of about 6 ng/mm2 (6000 resonance units). The three LRR proteins studied, biglycan, decorin, and chondroadherin, all interacted with collagen VI (Fig. 1, upper panel). Complexes were formed within a few minutes after mixing individual components and visualized by electron microscopy after negative staining. Five to ten experiments were carried out for each condition, and some 300 complex particles were evaluated. Whereas biglycan (left) and decorin (middle) bound only close to the N-terminal parts of collagen VI, chondroadherin (right) was found both close to the globules corresponding the N-terminal and the C-terminal parts of the collagen VI molecules in the tetramers (Fig. 1, lower panel). Over 85% of the complexes exhibited only one gold-labeled decorin or biglycan molecule per collagen VI N-terminal or only one gold-labeled chondroadherin particle per collagen VI N- and C-terminal, respectively. These numbers did not vary significantly between the experiments. No binding to the filamentous triple helical portion of the collagen was observed. Collagen VI, incubated with recombinant biglycan at room temperature and then visualized with electron microscopy after negative staining, formed networks extending over several micrometers already after a few minutes (Fig. 2). There was no difference between intact collagen VI (Fig. 2 a) and collagen VI that had been digested with pepsin, which does not affect biglycan binding to the collagen (Fig. 2 b). Upon magnification, these networks exhibited an organized, hexagonal type of structure in all cases (Fig. 3). Further studies were performed with pepsin-extracted collagen VI for practical reasons. Between 300 and 500 different networks were evaluated in these and the following experiments. By labeling biglycan with 3.5-nm colloidal gold before incubation with collagen VI, it became possible to identify its localization to the intra-network junctions that appeared with a distance of about 100 nm (Fig. 3 a). The incorporation of biglycan reached its saturation at concentrations around 5 nm when the ratio of biglycan:collagen VI was 1:4 (Fig. 3 b). The dependence of collagen VI network formation on biglycan concentration was investigated. At a molar ratio of 3:4 (biglycan:collagen VI), the mean surface area of the collagen VI networks was not significantly changed upon further addition of biglycan (Fig. 4 a). To permit tracing of biglycan in the collagen networks, the proteoglycan was labeled with gold. In control experiments it was shown that this labeling did not alter the effects on the collagen network formation (Fig. 4 b). The organization of the collagen VI networks formed was further studied. In the presence of biglycan they did not appear to change compared with 5 min when the incubation time was extended overnight (Fig. 5, Bgn). When collagen VI was incubated with recombinant decorin at the same molar ratio to collagen as that used for biglycan, the formation of organized networks was much slower (Figs. 5 and 6). Although at early times the network formation was poor, after very extended incubation times they resembled those obtained with biglycan present (Fig. 5, Dcn). Biglycan and decorin extracted and purified from tissue under denaturing conditions showed the same effect as the recombinant proteoglycans (not shown). To further investigate the different effects of the two proteoglycans, we chose to focus on the role of the glycosaminoglycan substituents for their ability to assist in organizing collagen VI. Biglycan core protein, in which glycosaminoglycan chains had been removed by chondroitinase ABC digestion prior to incubation with collagen VI, did not induce collagen VI network formation. Thus, only small clusters (up to 500 nm2) of collagen VI without any apparent organization were found after as much as 18 h of incubation (Fig. 5,Bgn-core). These small clusters showed no difference from those formed when collagen VI was incubated alone under the same conditions (Fig. 5, −). Chondroadherin, which lacks glycosaminoglycan chains while being able to bind close to the globular domains of collagen VI (Fig. 1, CHAD), was consistently unable to catalyze network formation (Fig. 5, CHAD). Incubation of collagen VI with the trypsin-released peptide containing the two glycosaminoglycan chains did not catalyze network formation (not shown). The networks formed in the presence of intact biglycan did not appear different when isolated dermatan sulfate peptides or biglycan core protein were added as putative competitors (data not shown). Addition of dermatan sulfate or biglycan core protein to the preformed collagen VI-biglycan networks did not disrupt formed networks nor did digestion with chondroitinase ABC (data not shown). A closer examination of the kinetics of the formation of collagen VI hexagonal networks under the influence of intact biglycan as well as decorin was performed with incubations for different times at room temperature. The mean areas of the networks formed were measured and plotted against time. We found a significant difference in the ability of biglycan compared with decorin to catalyze the formation of hexagonal collagen VI networks. When intact biglycan is present, networks with an average surface area of 40 μm2 are formed within less than 5 min. After 5 min, further modification of the networks is slow. In the presence of decorin, there is very limited network formation even after several hours. However, at 24 h of incubation networks formed in the presence of decorin resemble those in the presence of biglycan (Fig. 6). Even if the formation of collagen VI networks with biglycan was a fast process, smaller aggregates could be captured and visualized at time = 0. Here we found structures that appeared to form different pre-stages of hexagonal networks where laterally aligned collagen VI tetramers gradually were replaced by larger clusters organized as hexagonal stars (Fig. 7). Biglycan as well as decorin have previously been shown to interact with the N-terminal part of pepsin-treated collagen VI (22Wiberg C. Hedbom E. Khairullina A. Lamandé S.R. Oldberg Å. Timpl R. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18947-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This interaction was not dependent on the glycosaminoglycan side chains. In the present study we show a novel role for biglycan in collagen VI network formation and clearly demonstrate that also the glycosaminoglycan side chains have an important function. Biglycan, which is the only LRR protein substituted with two glycosaminoglycan chains, showed a unique ability to organize collagen VI into a hexagonal-like network in a very short period of time,i.e. only a few minutes. This appears to represent a biologically relevant property, because collagen VI networks with similar appearance have previously been found in tissue (4Bruns R.R. Press W. Engvall E. Timpl R. Gross J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Decorin substituted with only one glycosaminoglycan chain also catalyzed the formation of collagen VI networks but was much less efficient, requiring a distinctively longer time to do so. In cartilage, where collagen VI is enriched in the pericellular capsule of chondrons (45Poole C.A. Ayad S. Schofield J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 635-643PubMed Google Scholar), biglycan is predominantly located in the pericellular matrix while decorin is located interterritorially (46Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 47Miosge N. Flachsbart K. Goetz W. Schultz W. Kresse H. Herken R. Histochem. J. 1994; 26: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). High resolution co-localization studies of collagen VI and the LRR proteins in different tissues will provide important information of their rolesin vivo. Although our results strongly suggest that biglycan has a role in collagen VI network formation and function, the presence of such interactions in vivo remains to be established. Also the different effects of decorin and biglycan on collagen VI assembly may be relevant to the fine-tuning of the process. The roles of the proteins may differ between tissues. The presence of apparent pre-stages of collagen VI networks in the presence of biglycan allows us to establish a model that is likely to be representative for the network formation (Fig. 7). Thus, in early stages of network formation collagen VI tetramers align laterally to form small bundles consisting of typically four to six collagen VI tetramers. This appears to occur via adherence of the outer, N-terminal parts of collagen VI to each other. These bundles further associate via their outer ends into an organization of whole “stars” that gradually assemble into larger aggregates. The localization of gold-labeled biglycan to the intra-network junctions, corresponding to the N-terminal part of the collagen VI molecules, fits well with our previous results (22Wiberg C. Hedbom E. Khairullina A. Lamandé S.R. Oldberg Å. Timpl R. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18947-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Biglycan digested with chondroitinase ABC to remove the glycosaminoglycan chains as well as chondroadherin lacking such chains showed no ability to organize collagen VI, demonstrating that the glycosaminoglycans play a crucial role in the process of collagen VI network formation. Interestingly, fibromodulin, with one or two keratan sulfate chains different from those dermatan sulfate chains in biglycan and decorin, shows the same effect as decorin (not shown), thus indicating that the specific properties of the glycosaminoglycan substitution might be less important than the clustered, negatively charged groups. In a recent study (48Krishnan P. Hocking A.M. Scholtz J.M. Pace C.N. Holik K.K. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10945-10950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) it was shown that the secondary structure of biglycan and decorin was not altered by digestion with chondroitinase ABC. This structure, however, appeared to be influenced by its post-translational modifications with oligosaccharides. It is thus possible to add an additional independent functional domain via glycosaminoglycan substitutions and indirectly control the organization of other extracellular components like collagen VI. It has been reported that non-glycosylated forms of biglycan and decorin can be found in normal human articular cartilage. The proportion of such decorin non-glycosylated forms decreases in arthritic cartilage (49Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar) and is potentially of relevance to collagen VI assembly. In addition, decorin can be found in two distinct isoforms in chicken, substituted with one or two glycosaminoglycan chains, the latter thought to function as a biglycan substitute (50Blaschke U.K. Hedbom E. Bruckner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30347-30353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulating various glycosylated forms of LRR proteoglycans may represent a physiologically used mechanism in collagen VI assembly. Recently mice deficient in one or two of the four most prominent and widely expressed LRR proteoglycans (biglycan, decorin, fibromodulin, and lumican) were generated (for review see Ref. 51Ameye L. Young M. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The deficiencies in decorin or biglycan resulted in abnormal collagen I and II fibril architecture. Deficiency in both proteoglycans enhanced this effect. Thus the collagen phenotypes demonstrated a cooperative, sequential, timely orchestrated action of these molecules that shape the architecture and mechanical properties of the collagen matrix. The data now presented show that it will be highly relevant to extend our studies on the collagen VI matrix in tissues, which lack LRR proteoglycan gene products. Together with previous results (22Wiberg C. Hedbom E. Khairullina A. Lamandé S.R. Oldberg Å. Timpl R. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18947-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), it is now becoming apparent that biglycan and decorin interact with collagen VI via their core proteins at the same time as their glycosaminoglycan chains appear to have a crucial role in guiding collagen VI into the organized structures observed in this study as well as in tissue (4Bruns R.R. Press W. Engvall E. Timpl R. Gross J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by the fact that other members of the LRR protein family not substituted with glycosaminoglycan chain(s), albeit able to bind to collagen VI, do not induce the formation of extended organized networks. Neither core protein nor isolated glycosaminoglycan chains nor the isolated peptide with the doublet glycosaminoglycan chains inhibits the process. This indicates that an important cooperative binding of the two sites occurs in the soluble phase that is apparently not seen in, for example, surface plasmon resonance. These apparent contradictory results can be explained if the proteoglycans bind via their core protein and their glycosaminoglycan chains subsequently serve to keep the collagen molecules separated while assembly is initiated.

https://openalex.org/W2076018512,"Compartmentalization of protein kinases and phosphatases with substrates is a means to increase the efficacy of signal transduction events. The A-kinaseanchoring protein, AKAP79, is a multivalent anchoring protein that maintains the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and protein phosphatase-2B (PP2B/calcineurin) at the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses where it is recruited into complexes withN-methyl-d-aspartic acid or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-subtype glutamate receptors. We have used cellular targeting of AKAP79 truncation and deletion mutants as an assay to map the PP2B-binding site on AKAP79. We demonstrate that residues 315–360 are necessary and sufficient for AKAP79-PP2B anchoring in cells. Multiple determinants contained within this region bind directly to the A subunit of PP2B and inhibit phosphatase activity. Peptides spanning the 315–360 region of AKAP79 can antagonize PP2B anchoring in vitro and targeting in transfected cells. Electrophysiological experiments further emphasize this point by demonstrating that a peptide encompassing residues 330–357 of AKAP79 attenuates PP2B-dependent down-regulation of GluR1 receptor currents when perfused into HEK293 cells. We propose that the structural features of this AKAP79-PP2B-binding domain may share similarities with other proteins that serve to coordinate PP2B localization and activity.

We demonstrate that residues 315–360 are necessary and sufficient for AKAP79-PP2B anchoring in cells. Multiple determinants contained within this region bind directly to the A subunit of PP2B and inhibit phosphatase activity. Peptides spanning the 315–360 region of AKAP79 can antagonize PP2B anchoring in vitro and targeting in transfected cells. Electrophysiological experiments further emphasize this point by demonstrating that a peptide encompassing residues 330–357 of AKAP79 attenuates PP2B-dependent down-regulation of GluR1 receptor currents when perfused into HEK293 cells. We propose that the structural features of this AKAP79-PP2B-binding domain may share similarities with other proteins that serve to coordinate PP2B localization and activity. The efficient transmission of cellular signals often involves the orientation of signaling proteins in relation to their upstream activators and downstream targets. This is often achieved through association with anchoring and scaffolding proteins that compartmentalize signaling enzymes in distinct subcellular environments (1Pawson T. Scott J.D.

For example, A-kinaseanchoring proteins (AKAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: AKAP, A-kinase anchoring proteins; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PP2B, protein phosphatase-2B; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. 1The abbreviations used are: AKAP, A-kinase anchoring proteins; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PP2B, protein phosphatase-2B; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. bind the regulatory (R) subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to localize this broad specificity enzyme to discrete subcellular environments (4Colledge M.

Each AKAP contains a conserved amphipathic helix that binds to the R subunit dimer with high affinity and targeting domains that direct the PKA-AKAP complex to specific subcellular compartments (6Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Google Scholar, 7Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Carr D.W. Westphal R. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1651-1662Google Scholar). A likely consequence of these protein-protein interactions is that AKAP-PKA complexes are maintained in the vicinity of selected phosphoproteins and substrates for the kinase. Another important role of AKAPs is to serve as scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein complexes that include PKA, other protein kinases, phosphodiesterases, and a variety of protein phosphatases (8Smith F.D. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R32-R40Google Scholar). The simultaneous anchoring of kinases and phosphatases provides an efficient means to confer bi-directional control on the phosphorylation status of substrate proteins (9Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 423-426Google Scholar) have demonstrated that anchoring of kinases and phosphatases ensures the efficient regulation of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. One prominent mediator of this process is the multivalent anchoring protein AKAP79 that anchors PKA, protein kinase C (PKC), and protein phosphatase-2B (PP2B/calcineurin) (12Carr D.W.

Precise orientation of the AKAP79 signaling complex toward substrates such as ionotropic glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic densities of neurons involves additional protein-protein interactions between the anchoring protein and membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins. This intricate molecular architecture facilitates PKA phosphorylation at a site in the cytoplasmic tail of the GluR1 glutamate receptor channel as well as its efficient dephosphorylation by PP2B (10Tavalin S.J.

In this report we describe experiments that map the PP2B-binding site to a region of ∼45 amino acids that contains multiple binding sites and inhibitory determinants. Furthermore, we show that a peptide from this region disrupts phosphatase targeting and attenuates PP2B-dependent down-regulation of homomeric GluR1 glutamate receptor currents inside cells.DISCUSSIONWe have mapped a region in the neuronally expressed anchoring protein AKAP79 that is necessary for binding and inhibiting the calcium/calmodulin-dependant phosphatase PP2B/calcineurin. A combination of biochemical and enzymatic approaches has identified multiple binding and inhibitory determinants that are located between residues 318 and 357 of the anchoring protein. Our characterization of this PP2B-binding region is the latest in a series of studies that have dissected functional regions within AKAP79 that are responsible for the interaction with distinct signaling enzymes. Residues 391–408 form an amphipathic helix that binds to the R subunit dimer of the PKA holoenzyme with nanomolar affinity (7Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Carr D.W. Westphal R. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1651-1662Google Scholar, 12Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 24: 16816-16823Google Scholar, 19Hausken Z.E. Dell'Acqua M.L. Coghlan V.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29016-29022Google Scholar). Peptides spanning this region have been used by many investigators to disrupt a variety of cAMP-responsive events by uncoupling PKA location inside cells (20Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E.

Peptides spanning this region bind to the kinase with micromolar affinities and inhibit the bound enzyme. This effect is reversed by calcium/calmodulin, which competes for interaction with the 31–52 region and releases the active kinase from the signaling complex at the postsynaptic densities of neurons (26Faux M.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17038-17044Google Scholar, 27Faux M.C. Rollins E.N. Edwards A.S. Langeberg L.K. Newton A.C. Scott J.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 443-452Google Scholar).In this report, we demonstrate that a family of peptides synthesized to regions of the anchoring protein between residues 318 and 357 disrupt the subcellular location of the phosphatase and inhibit PP2B-dependent phosphorylation events. Another region of AKAP79 within the membrane targeting domain (residues 88–102) may also participate in PP2B anchoring (13Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-112Google Scholar, 16Dell'Acqua M.L. Faux M.C. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2246-2260Google Scholar, 17Kashishian A. Howard M. Loh C. Gallatin W.M. Hoekstra M.F. Lai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27412-27419Google Scholar), although the inhibitory potency of peptides to this site is ∼50-fold less than the AKAP79-(330–357) peptide, and they cannot displace the phosphatase from its sites of anchoring. Therefore, we propose that the region between residues 318 and 357 is likely to contain most of the high affinity determinants for PP2B anchoring. This postulate is consistent with recent reports (17Kashishian A. Howard M. Loh C. Gallatin W.M. Hoekstra M.F. Lai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27412-27419Google Scholar, 28Taigen T. De Windt L.J.

Hajjar R.J. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3322-3327Google Scholar) that recombinant fragments of AKAP79 that include this region inhibit PP2B signaling events in transfected cells and transgenic mice. Interestingly, the AKAP79-(330–357) and AKAP79-(338–357) peptides are slightly more potent inhibitors of the phosphatase than the full-length anchoring protein. Similarly we have observed that protein fragments of AKAP79 sometimes work more efficiently than the full-length protein. For example, residues 108–427 inhibit PP2B more effectively than the full-length protein (16Dell'Acqua M.L. Faux M.C. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2246-2260Google Scholar). Likewise, the first 75 amino acids of the anchoring protein is a more potent inhibitor of PKC activity than the full-length protein (14Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Google Scholar).The AKAP79-(318–357) sequence exhibits some similarity to the binding sites of other PP2B-interacting proteins. For example, the organization of serines, threonines, and the clustering of basic amino acids in this region is reminiscent of the 38-residue PP2B-binding region in Cain, (calcineurin inhibitor)/cabin (30Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Google Scholar, 31Luo S. Youn H.-D. Loh C. Stolow M. He W. Liu J.O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 703-711Google Scholar). Both proteins are non-competitive inhibitors of PP2B activity that inhibit the phosphatase in the low micromolar range and bind PP2B at a site distinct from the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and cyclosporin A (13Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-112Google Scholar,17Kashishian A. Howard M. Loh C. Gallatin W.M. Hoekstra M.F. Lai Y. J. Biol.

Another common characteristic is the presence of a loosely conserved “PIXIXIT” motif (where Xrepresents any amino acid). This sequence was first identified in the transcription factor NFATc and has been found in the docking sites of other PP2B interacting partners including Cain/cabin and the muscle-specific protein MCIP1,2 (33Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Google Scholar, 34Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Google Scholar, 35Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Yang J. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8719-8725Google Scholar). Residues 337–343 of AKAP79 ( PIA II IT) form the PIXIXIT motif, and it is totally conserved in the murine and bovine orthologs, AKAP150 and AKAP75 (36Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Google Scholar, 37Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Google Scholar, 38Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Google Scholar). Although not formally proven, it is likely that this sequence represents a principle site of contact with the phosphatase, because the AKAP79-(330–357) peptide, which includes this region, inhibits phosphatase activity at micromolar concentrations and competes for binding with the intact anchoring protein. However, it is clearly evident that other regions of AKAP79 contribute to PP2B interactions as peptides upstream of the PIXIXIT motif also bind and inhibit the phosphatase. These findings are certainly consistent with the notion that multiple determinants located in a central segment of the AKAP79 linear sequence act in tandem to anchor PP2B and inhibit phosphatase activity inside cells. Apparently multisite contact between phosphatases and their binding partners is a common theme in the subcellular targeting of this enzyme class, as a second PP2B-binding site has been defined within the regulatory domain of NFATc which may act synergistically with the PIXIXIT motif to permit a high affinity interaction with the phosphatase (39Park S. Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7130-7135Google Scholar). Similarly, there are examples of type 1 phosphatase targeting subunits that interact with the catalytic subunit (PP1c) through multiple sites (40Allen P.B. Kwon Y.G. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4089-4095Google Scholar, 41Schillace R.V. Voltz J.W. Sim A.T. Shenolikar S. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12128-12134Google Scholar).One goal of our study was to generate peptide-based antagonists of PP2B function inside cells. Accordingly, we have shown that perfusion of the AKAP79-(330–357) peptide prevents the attenuation of GluR1 type AMPA channels by the AKAP79 signaling complex in HEK293 cells. We have shown previously that AKAP79-mediated anchoring of PP2B confers a calcium-dependent rundown of the channel through the dephosphorylation of serine 845, a site in the cytoplasmic tail of the GluR1 subunit (10Tavalin S.J. Colledge M. Hell J.W. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3044-3051Google Scholar). Basal phosphorylation of Ser-845 is maintained by anchored PKA, suggesting that AKAP79 contributes to the regulation of this channel by positioning kinases and phosphates in close proximity to a subset of their substrates (10Tavalin S.J. Colledge M. Hell J.W. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3044-3051Google Scholar, 11Fraser I.D. Scott J.D. Neuron. 1999; 23: 423-426Google Scholar, 15Colledge M. Dean R.A.

Our electrophysiological measurements infer that perfusion of the AKAP79-(330–357) peptide shifts the equilibrium in favor of the phosphorylated state of GluR1. Importantly, our control experiments demonstrate that this peptide is only active in the presence of AKAP79, thereby indicating that PP2B targeting ensures efficient modulation of GluR1 currents. Yet our experiments are unable to delineate the mechanism of action of this peptide. Our biochemical analyses would suggest that it must function by displacing PP2B from its site of action and/or as an inhibitor of the anchored phosphatase. Nonetheless, our experiments highlight the utility of this reagent as a cell-based modulator of PP2B. Likewise, Cain has also been used to perturb PP2B function inside cells, as it binds the endocytic machinery through amphiphysin 1 to negatively regulate PP2B/dynamin-dependent synaptic vesicle endocytosis (30Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Google Scholar, 32Lai M.M. Luo H.R. Burnett P.E. Hong J.J. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34017-34020Google Scholar). Thus it is tempting to speculate that AKAP79 anchoring and inhibition of PP2B might function in a concerted manner to modulate not only AMPA receptor currents but also to attenuate the phosphorylation events that control receptor endocytosis. The efficient transmission of cellular signals often involves the orientation of signaling proteins in relation to their upstream activators and downstream targets. This is often achieved through association with anchoring and scaffolding proteins that compartmentalize signaling enzymes in distinct subcellular environments (1Pawson T. Scott J.D.

For example, A-kinaseanchoring proteins (AKAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: AKAP, A-kinase anchoring proteins; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PP2B, protein phosphatase-2B; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. 1The abbreviations used are: AKAP, A-kinase anchoring proteins; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PP2B, protein phosphatase-2B; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. bind the regulatory (R) subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to localize this broad specificity enzyme to discrete subcellular environments (4Colledge M.

Each AKAP contains a conserved amphipathic helix that binds to the R subunit dimer with high affinity and targeting domains that direct the PKA-AKAP complex to specific subcellular compartments (6Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Google Scholar, 7Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Carr D.W. Westphal R. Scott J.D.

Peptides spanning this region bind to the kinase with micromolar affinities and inhibit the bound enzyme. This effect is reversed by calcium/calmodulin, which competes for interaction with the 31–52 region and releases the active kinase from the signaling complex at the postsynaptic densities of neurons (26Faux M.C. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17038-17044Google Scholar, 27Faux M.C. Rollins E.N. Edwards A.S. Langeberg L.K. Newton A.C. Scott J.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 443-452Google Scholar).In this report, we demonstrate that a family of peptides synthesized to regions of the anchoring protein between residues 318 and 357 disrupt the subcellular location of the phosphatase and inhibit PP2B-dependent phosphorylation events. Another region of AKAP79 within the membrane targeting domain (residues 88–102) may also participate in PP2B anchoring (13Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-112Google Scholar, 16Dell'Acqua M.L. Faux M.C. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2246-2260Google Scholar, 17Kashishian A. Howard M. Loh C. Gallatin W.M. Hoekstra M.F. Lai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27412-27419Google Scholar), although the inhibitory potency of peptides to this site is ∼50-fold less than the AKAP79-(330–357) peptide, and they cannot displace the phosphatase from its sites of anchoring. Therefore, we propose that the region between residues 318 and 357 is likely to contain most of the high affinity determinants for PP2B anchoring. This postulate is consistent with recent reports (17Kashishian A. Howard M. Loh C. Gallatin W.M. Hoekstra M.F. Lai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27412-27419Google Scholar, 28Taigen T. De Windt L.J.

A. 2001; 98: 3322-3327Google Scholar) that recombinant fragments of AKAP79 that include this region inhibit PP2B signaling events in transfected cells and transgenic mice. Interestingly, the AKAP79-(330–357) and AKAP79-(338–357) peptides are slightly more potent inhibitors of the phosphatase than the full-length anchoring protein. Similarly we have observed that protein fragments of AKAP79 sometimes work more efficiently than the full-length protein. For example, residues 108–427 inhibit PP2B more effectively than the full-length protein (16Dell'Acqua M.L. Faux M.C. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2246-2260Google Scholar). Likewise, the first 75 amino acids of the anchoring protein is a more potent inhibitor of PKC activity than the full-length protein (14Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Google Scholar).The AKAP79-(318–357) sequence exhibits some similarity to the binding sites of other PP2B-interacting proteins. For example, the organization of serines, threonines, and the clustering of basic amino acids in this region is reminiscent of the 38-residue PP2B-binding region in Cain, (calcineurin inhibitor)/cabin (30Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Google Scholar, 31Luo S. Youn H.-D. Loh C. Stolow M. He W. Liu J.O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 703-711Google Scholar). Both proteins are non-competitive inhibitors of PP2B activity that inhibit the phosphatase in the low micromolar range and bind PP2B at a site distinct from the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and cyclosporin A (13Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-112Google Scholar,17Kashishian A. Howard M. Loh C. Gallatin W.M. Hoekstra M.F. Lai Y. J. Biol.

Another common characteristic is the presence of a loosely conserved “PIXIXIT” motif (where Xrepresents any amino acid). This sequence was first identified in the transcription factor NFATc and has been found in the docking sites of other PP2B interacting partners including Cain/cabin and the muscle-specific protein MCIP1,2 (33Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Google Scholar, 34Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A.

Residues 337–343 of AKAP79 ( PIA II IT) form the PIXIXIT motif, and it is totally conserved in the murine and bovine orthologs, AKAP150 and AKAP75 (36Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Google Scholar, 37Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Google Scholar, 38Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Google Scholar). Although not formally proven, it is likely that this sequence represents a principle site of contact with the phosphatase, because the AKAP79-(330–357) peptide, which includes this region, inhibits phosphatase activity at micromolar concentrations and competes for binding with the intact anchoring protein. However, it is clearly evident that other regions of AKAP79 contribute to PP2B interactions as peptides upstream of the PIXIXIT motif also bind and inhibit the phosphatase. These findings are certainly consistent with the notion that multiple determinants located in a central segment of the AKAP79 linear sequence act in tandem to anchor PP2B and inhibit phosphatase activity inside cells. Apparently multisite contact between phosphatases and their binding partners is a common theme in the subcellular targeting of this enzyme class, as a second PP2B-binding site has been defined within the regulatory domain of NFATc which may act synergistically with the PIXIXIT motif to permit a high affinity interaction with the phosphatase (39Park S. Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7130-7135Google Scholar). Similarly, there are examples of type 1 phosphatase targeting subunits that interact with the catalytic subunit (PP1c) through multiple sites (40Allen P.B. Kwon Y.G. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4089-4095Google Scholar, 41Schillace R.V. Voltz J.W. Sim A.T. Shenolikar S. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12128-12134Google Scholar).One goal of our study was to generate peptide-based antagonists of PP2B function inside cells. Accordingly, we have shown that perfusion of the AKAP79-(330–357) peptide prevents the attenuation of GluR1 type AMPA channels by the AKAP79 signaling complex in HEK293 cells. We have shown previously that AKAP79-mediated anchoring of PP2B confers a calcium-dependent rundown of the channel through the dephosphorylation of serine 845, a site in the cytoplasmic tail of the GluR1 subunit (10Tavalin S.J. Colledge M. Hell J.W. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3044-3051Google Scholar). Basal phosphorylation of Ser-845 is maintained by anchored PKA, suggesting that AKAP79 contributes to the regulation of this channel by positioning kinases and phosphates in close proximity to a subset of their substrates (10Tavalin S.J. Colledge M. Hell J.W. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3044-3051Google Scholar, 11Fraser I.D. Scott J.D. Neuron. 1999; 23: 423-426Google Scholar, 15Colledge M. Dean R.A.

Our electrophysiological measurements infer that perfusion of the AKAP79-(330–357) peptide shifts the equilibrium in favor of the phosphorylated state of GluR1. Importantly, our control experiments demonstrate that this peptide is only active in the presence of AKAP79, thereby indicating that PP2B targeting ensures efficient modulation of GluR1 currents. Yet our experiments are unable to delineate the mechanism of action of this peptide. Our biochemical analyses would suggest that it must function by displacing PP2B from its site of action and/or as an inhibitor of the anchored phosphatase. Nonetheless, our experiments highlight the utility of this reagent as a cell-based modulator of PP2B. Likewise, Cain has also been used to perturb PP2B function inside cells, as it binds the endocytic machinery through amphiphysin 1 to negatively regulate PP2B/dynamin-dependent synaptic vesicle endocytosis (30Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Google Scholar, 32Lai M.M. Luo H.R. Burnett P.E. Hong J.J. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34017-34020Google Scholar). Thus it is tempting to speculate that AKAP79 anchoring and inhibition of PP2B might function in a concerted manner to modulate not only AMPA receptor currents but also to attenuate the phosphorylation events that control receptor endocytosis. We have mapped a region in the neuronally expressed anchoring protein AKAP79 that is necessary for binding and inhibiting the calcium/calmodulin-dependant phosphatase PP2B/calcineurin. A combination of biochemical and enzymatic approaches has identified multiple binding and inhibitory determinants that are located between residues 318 and 357 of the anchoring protein. Our characterization of this PP2B-binding region is the latest in a series of studies that have dissected functional regions within AKAP79 that are responsible for the interaction with distinct signaling enzymes. Residues 391–408 form an amphipathic helix that binds to the R subunit dimer of the PKA holoenzyme with nanomolar affinity (7Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Carr D.W. Westphal R. Scott J.D.

We made the novel finding that apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells correlates with specific degradation of laminin from the underlying inner limiting membrane and an increase in gelatinolytic metalloproteinase activity. These changes co-localize with a specific increase in levels of the matrix metalloproteinase, gelatinase B (GelB; MMP-9). Using a transgenic mouse line harboring a reporter gene driven by the GelB promoter, we further show that increased GelB is controlled by activation of the GelB promoter. These findings led us to hypothesize that GelB activity plays a role in ganglion cell death and degradation of laminin. Applying the genetic approach, we demonstrate that GelB-deficient mice are protected against these pathological changes. This is the first report demonstrating a causal connection between GelB activity and pathological changes to the inner retina after optic nerve ligation.

Retinal ganglion cells contribute to the innermost cellular layer of the neural retina, functioning to relay visual information to the processing centers in the brain. This transfer occurs through the ganglion cell axons, which bundle together as they exit from the eye to form the optic nerve. Several eye diseases are characterized by damage to the optic nerve and specific loss of ganglion cells. Prominent among these is glaucoma, one of the three major causes of irreversible blindness in the United States today (1Epstein D.L. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1987; 105: 1187-1188Google Scholar, 2Osborne N.N. Ugarte M. Chao M. Chidlow G. Bae J.H. Wood J.P. Nash M.S. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1999; 43: 102-128Google Scholar, 3Quigley H.A. Aust. N. Z. J. Ophthalmol. 1995; 23: 85-91Google Scholar). An understanding of the mechanisms leading to ganglion cell loss in diseases of the optic nerve is essential for the design of much-needed therapeutic strategies to save sight. Selective depletion of ganglion cells from the retina can be experimentally induced by application of several types of insults. These include models of ischemia/reperfusion injury due to short term blood vessel occlusion (2Osborne N.N. Ugarte M. Chao M. Chidlow G. Bae J.H. Wood J.P. Nash M.S. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1999; 43: 102-128Google Scholar, 4Hayreh S.S. Weingeist T.A. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1980; 64: 896-912Google Scholar), selective vascular ligation (5Barnett N.L. Osborne N.N. Brain Res. 1995; 677: 337-340Google Scholar, 6Otori Y. Shimada S. Morimura H. Ishimoto I. Tohyama M. Tano Y. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1997; 42: 96-104Google Scholar, 7Lafuente M.P. Villegas-Perez M.P. Sobrado-Calvo P. Garcia-Aviles A. Miralles D.I. Vidal-Sanz M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2074-2084Google Scholar), photothrombosis (8Mosinger J.L. Olney J.W. Exp. Neurol. 1989; 105: 110-113Google Scholar), or occlusion of the carotid artery (9Block F. Schwarz M. Sontag K.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 144: 124-126Google Scholar). Eliminating the connection between ganglion cells and the brain by compressing or severing their axons also causes specific loss of ganglion cells. It is suggested that this may be due to blockade of retrograde neurotrophin transfer (10Berkelaar M. Clarke D.B. Wang Y.C. Bray G.M. Aguayo A.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4368-4374Google Scholar). Both mechanisms may contribute to ganglion cell loss after elevation of intraocular pressure above systolic blood pressure (12Hughes W.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 53: 573-582Google Scholar), which compresses structures at the optic nerve head and is a major causal risk factor for glaucoma (13Buchi E.R. Jpn. J.

Optic nerve ligation is thought to lead to ganglion cell loss by similar mechanisms (11Stefansson E. Wilson C.A. Schoen T. Kuwabara T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 1050-1055Google Scholar). Most investigators in the field accept that optic nerve ligation is a useful experimental model for studying the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to optic nerve damage in glaucoma and related diseases (2Osborne N.N. Ugarte M. Chao M. Chidlow G. Bae J.H. Wood J.P. Nash M.S. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1999; 43: 102-128Google Scholar). The retina is part of the central nervous system, and although there are many specific differences, there are also many commonalities. It is known that neuronal cell death in pathologies of both retina and brain occurs by apoptotic mechanisms (6Otori Y. Shimada S. Morimura H. Ishimoto I. Tohyama M. Tano Y. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1997; 42: 96-104Google Scholar, 13Buchi E.R. Jpn. J. Ophthalmol. 1992; 36: 62-68Google Scholar, 15Selles-Navarro I. Villegas-Perez M.P. Salvador-Silva M. Ruiz-Gomez J.M. Vidal-Sanz M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2002-2014Google Scholar, 17Quigley H.A. Nickells R.W. Kerrigan L.A. Pease M.E. Thibault D.J. Zack D.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 774-786Google Scholar, 20Garcia-Valenzuela E. Shareef S. Walsh J. Sharma S.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 33-44Google Scholar). An increase in apoptotic cells is also found in diseases specific to the optic nerve such as glaucoma (21Nickells R.W. Zack D.J. Ophthalmic Genet. 1996; 17: 145-165Google Scholar, 22Nickells R.W. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1999; 43: 151-161Google Scholar). Current opinion holds that cell death is stimulated by an excess of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate (23Coyle J.T. Puttfarcken P. Science. 1993; 262: 689-695Google Scholar,24Lipton S.A. Rosenberg P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 613-622Google Scholar). According to this model, over-abundant glutamate is the end result of a variety of insults including inappropriate electrical activity, ischemia/reperfusion injury, or neurotrophin deprivation. These insults are thought to promote entry of calcium ions into the cell, initiating downstream apoptotic events. Consistent with this idea, injection of glutamate agonists into the hippocampus induces neuronal apoptosis (25Coyle J.T. Molliver M.E. Kuhar M.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1978; 180: 301-323Google Scholar). Similarly, injection of a glutamate agonist into the posterior chamber of the eye induces specific death of ganglion cells (26Siliprandi R. Canella R. Carmignoto G. Schiavo N. Zanellato A. Zanoni R. Vantini G. Visual Neurosci. 1992; 8: 567-573Google Scholar,27Li Y. Schlamp C.L. Nickells R.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1004-1008Google Scholar). Tissue-damaging stimuli activate specific repair and remodeling mechanisms. These processes are precisely regulated through reciprocal interaction between the resident tissue cells and their extracellular matrix-supporting structures. Integral to this are two enzyme systems, the plasminogen activator (PA) 1The abbreviations used are: PA, plasminogen activator; PG, plasminogen; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; GelB, gelatinase B; GCL, ganglion cell layer; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; IPL, inner plexiform layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; TUNEL, TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling -plasminogen (PG) system and a family of enzymes known as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The PA-PG system effects removal of fibrin matrices and also plays a part in converting inactive pro-MMPs to their active forms. MMPs perform these same functions but within a more comprehensive context as both effectors and regulators of tissue remodeling (28Woessner J.F. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 1-14Google Scholar, 29Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Google Scholar). MMP substrates include essentially all extracellular matrix components as well as a wide array of molecules involved in intracellular adhesion, cell-matrix interaction, and cell signaling (29Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Google Scholar, 30Lochter A. Galosy S. Muschler J. Freedman N. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1861-1872Google Scholar). Both the PA-PG system and the MMP family have been implicated in the cascade of events leading to neuronal apoptosis in the central nervous system (31Rosenberg G.A. J. Neurotrauma. 1995; 12: 833-842Google Scholar, 32Rosenberg G.A. Dencoff J.E. Correa Jr., N. Reiners M. Ford C.C. Neurology. 1996; 46: 1626-1632Google Scholar, 33Clark A.W. Krekoski C.A. Bou S.S.

Dis. 2001; 8: 834-846Google Scholar). More specifically, mice deficient for tissue plasminogen activator or PG were found to be resistant to neuronal destruction induced by excitotoxins (37Tsirka S.E. Gualandris A. Amaral D.G. Strickland S. Nature. 1995; 377: 340-344Google Scholar, 38Tsirka S.E. Rogove A.D. Strickland S. Nature. 1996; 384: 123-124Google Scholar). Similarly, mice deficient for the matrix Metalloproteinase gelatinase B (GelB; MMP-9) were found to be resistant to both ischemic and impact injury to the cerebrum (39Asahi M. Asahi K. Jung J.C. del Zoppo G.J. Fini M.E. Lo E.H. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 1681-1689Google Scholar,40Wang X. Jung J. Asahi M. Chwang W. Russo L. Moskowitz M.A. Dixon C.E. Fini M.E. Lo E.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7037-7042Google Scholar). In contrast, deficiency of a related MMP, gelatinase A (GelA; MMP-2) had no effect on the course of the injury response (41Asahi M. Sumii T. Fini M.E. Itohara S. Lo E.H. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3003-3007Google Scholar). Laminin loss occurs in response to injection of glutamate into the hippocampus, and this is also mediated by the PA-PG proteolytic system (37Tsirka S.E. Gualandris A. Amaral D.G. Strickland S. Nature. 1995; 377: 340-344Google Scholar, 38Tsirka S.E. Rogove A.D. Strickland S. Nature. 1996; 384: 123-124Google Scholar). In this system, laminin loss in response to excitotoxicity was found to contribute to neural cell death. The starting point for the current study was the observation that GelB is expressed at low constitutive levels specifically in the ganglion cell layer of the retina (42Canete S.R. Gui Y.H. Linask K.K. Muschel R.J. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 88: 37-52Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that this particular MMP might promote pathological changes that occur in diseases of the optic nerve. To investigate this hypothesis, we adapted an experimental model of optic nerve ligation to the mouse, allowing us to take a genetic approach to further define pathological mechanisms. All experiments with mice were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were used for experiments at 6–8 weeks of age. For experiments characterizing retinal injury and MMP expression, normal adult CD-1 mice were used (Charles River Breeding Laboratories). For experiments investigating the role of GelB (MMP-9) in retinal injury, the GelB-deficient strain (GelB−/−) on the 129SvEv/CD-1 mixed background was used. A corresponding matched littermate control line (GelB+/+) on the same background was used as the control for GelB-deficient mice (43Vu T.H. Shipley J.M. Bergers G. Berger J.E. Helms J.A. Hanahan D. Shapiro S.D. Senior R.M. Werb Z. Cell. 1998; 93: 411-422Google Scholar). GelB-deficient mice show delayed growth of long bones due to impaired vascularization of the growth plate but ultimately attain normal adulthood (43Vu T.H. Shipley J.M. Bergers G. Berger J.E. Helms J.A. Hanahan D. Shapiro S.D. Senior R.M. Werb Z. Cell. 1998; 93: 411-422Google Scholar). The eyes of GelB-deficient mice are of normal size, and corneas and lenses are clear (44Mohan R. Chintala S.K. Jung J.C. Villar W.V. McCabe F. Russo L.A. Lee Y. McCarthy B.E. Wollenberg K.R. Jester J.V. Wang M. Welgus H.G. Shipley J.M. Senior R.M. Fini M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2065-2072Google Scholar). Routine histological examination of adult eyes revealed no obvious anatomical changes in the retina between gel-B-deficient homozygous mice and their normal counterparts. Before surgery, mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 2% avertin (0.017 ml/g of body weight). The surgical procedure was an adaptation of a method for optic nerve ligation previously described for rats (11Stefansson E. Wilson C.A. Schoen T. Kuwabara T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 1050-1055Google Scholar). Briefly, a 6-0 nylon ligature was placed around the optic nerve and tightened until blood flow in all the retinal vessels was stopped as viewed under an operating microscope. After 30–60 min, re-perfusion of tissue was allowed by removal of the suture. Contralateral eyes served as controls. Animals were euthanized at various time points after performing the optic nerve ligation procedure, and eyes were enucleated for analysis. Eyes were embedded in optimal temperature cutting compound (Miles, Elkhart, IN). Transverse, 8-μm-thick cryostat sections were cut and placed onto Super-frost plus slides (Fisher). Histological staining was performed on sections after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. To detect apoptotic cells, the TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed using a kit (in situ cell death detection kit with fluorescein; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Counterstaining was performed for 2 min with propidium iodide (1 mg/ml) to define the nuclei of cells. Tissue sections were examined using a Nikon E400 light microscope equipped for epifluorescence, and the image was captured with a digital camera. Images acquired individually were either merged (for Fig.5 A) or showed separately (for Fig. 1 B).Figure 1Ganglion cell death in the mouse retina by apoptosis after optic nerve ligation. Tissue analysis was performed at the indicated time after optic nerve ligation in CD-1 mice and compared with untreated controls. A, frozen cross-sections (8 μm) of eyes prepared 2 days after optic nerve ligation were stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin (Fisher), and the retinas were observed by light microscopy (n = 3).ONL, outer nuclear layer. Note the loss of ganglion cells in the inner retina. 40× magnification. B, TUNEL assay was performed on frozen cross-sections (8 μm) of eyes 2 days after optic nerve ligation; retinas were examined by fluorescence microscopy to identify apoptotic cells (n = 3). The lower panel shows representative sections of the TUNEL assay. Thebright green spots over the light green background are the TUNEL-positive cells. Arrowsindicate such cells in the GCL. The photographs in the upper panel are similar sections stained with propidium iodide to identify all nuclei. Some TUNEL-positive staining is also present in the inner nuclear layer. 40× magnification. C, retrograde labeling of ganglion cells with FluoroGold was performed 1 week before optic nerve ligation. Two days, 4 days, and 1 week later, flat retinal mounts were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods,” and ganglion cell density was determined using a fluorescence microscope (n = 3 for each experimental group). The selected fields were located at approximately the same distance from the optic disk to account for the variation in retinal ganglion cells density as a function of distance from the optic disk. 40× magnification. D, quantitative estimation of ganglion cell loss after optic nerve ligation. Retinal ganglion cell density in representative images obtained from FluoroGold-labeled flat retinal mounts in the experiment described above (panel C) were counted using Scion Image analysis. The data were represented as the percentage of FluoroGold-labeled cells remaining at different time intervals after optic nerve ligation. All comparisons are significant. Statistical significance was determined using the Student ttest. n = 3, p < 0.005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Retrograde labeling of ganglion cells was performed as described previously (18Sawada A. Neufeld A.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 525-531Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 μl of a 5% solution of FluoroGold in 0.9% sodium chloride (Fluorochrome Inc., Englewood, CO) was injected into the superior colliculi of anesthetized mice immobilized in a stereotaxic apparatus. One week after FluoroGold application, the optic nerve was ligated as described above. At various time points thereafter, the animals were euthanized, and their eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. Eyes were bisected at the equator, the lenses were removed, and the posterior segments were fixed for an additional 30 min. To prepare flat mounts, retinas were dissected from the underlying sclera/choroid, flattened by six radial cuts, and mounted vitreal side up on superfrost slides. Retinal ganglion cells labeled with FluoroGold were counted in six microscopic fields of retina under a fluorescence microscope at 40× magnification. Labeled cells from four to six selected fields of identical size were counted. The selected fields were located at approximately the same distance from the optic disk to account for the variation in retinal ganglion cell density as a function of distance from the optic disk. Quantification of ganglion cell loss was performed using Scion image analysis software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). This technique identifies tissue sites where proteinases are actively available to catalyze cleavage of their substrates. It employs fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled DQ™-gelatin, (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a substrate for gelatinolytic MMPs, which emits a fluorescent signal when cleaved (45Oh L.Y. Larsen P.H. Krekoski C.A. Edwards D.R. Donovan F. Werb Z. Yong V.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8464-8475Google Scholar). Unfixed sections of tissue prepared by cryostat were incubated overnight at 37 °C with reaction buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mmNaN3, pH 7.6) containing 40 μg/ml DQ™-gelatin. The resulting enzymatic activity pattern was observed by fluorescence microscopy. Eyes were cut in half at the equator, and lenses and vitreous humors were removed. The retina was then gently peeled off with fine forceps, and two retinas were placed in each 1.5-ml tube. The tissues were homogenized on ice in 40 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. The total protein concentration in supernatants was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The presence of specific MMP protein species in retinal homogenates was determined by zymography (74Birkedal-Hansen H. Taylor R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1173-1178Google Scholar) according to our standard lab protocol (46Matsubara M. Girard M.T. Kublin C.L. Cintron C. Fini M.E. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 425-439Google Scholar). This technique detects both latent proenzymes and active enzyme forms based on the capacity for activation of proenzymes by SDS. In brief, retinal extracts containing equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were mixed with SDS gel-loading buffer and then loaded without reduction or heating onto 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin (Sigma). After electrophoresis, the gels were washed to remove SDS, developed under conditions optimal for MMPs (pH 7.4, 10 mmCaCl2), and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue-R 250 (Sigma). The location of proteinase species in the gels could be easily visualized as clear bands in a blue background of stained substrate. A sample containing GelA (MMP-2) and GelB (MMP-9) (which has been confirmed by zymography), the conditioned culture medium from rabbit corneal fibroblasts treated with phorbol myristate acetate (46Matsubara M. Girard M.T. Kublin C.L. Cintron C. Fini M.E. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 425-439Google Scholar), was co-electrophoresed for comparison. In addition, a reduced molecular weight size standard was included on all gels (Invitrogen). Samples of retinal tissue extract containing equal protein (20 μg) were mixed with sample buffer and separated on 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis was complete, the proteins were transferred of the gels to nylon membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then probed with either a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against mouse GelB (a kind gift from Dr. Robert M. Senior, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) or a polyclonal anti-laminin antibody developed in rabbit using laminin purified from the basement membrane of Englebreth Holm-swarm mouse sarcoma (Sigma). After washing again, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, the proteins were detected using a chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Purified mouse GelB (MMP-9) and GelA (MMP-2) (Chemicon International, Tamecula, CA) were used as standards. For detection of MMPs, sections of tissue prepared by cryostat were fixed by dipping slides in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. For detection of laminin, tissue sections were immersed briefly in acetone at −20 °C according to the method of Libby et al. (47Libby R.T. Xu Y. Selfors L.M. Brunken W.J. Hunter D.D. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 389: 655-667Google Scholar). Sections were subsequently processed for indirect immunofluorescent localization. The primary antibody probes used were a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against mouse GelB (described above), a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against mouse GelB (Neomarkers), a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against laminin derived from Engelbreth sarcoma (Sigma), and a monoclonal antibody against murine nidogen (Chemicon). The secondary antibody was either fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-labeled. Antibody binding was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Construction of CD-1 transgenic mouse line 3445 was previously described (48Mohan R. Rinehart W.B. Bargagna-Mohan P. Fini M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25903-25914Google Scholar). The transgene consists of bases −522 to +19 of the GelB promoter linked to a β-galactosidase reporter gene. Promoter activity in these mice closely parallels the expression of the endogenous GelB gene (48Mohan R. Rinehart W.B. Bargagna-Mohan P. Fini M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25903-25914Google Scholar). To visualize this activity, retinal cryostat sections (8 μm) were fixed for 25 min in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated with 2% X-gal solution (a substrate for β-galactosidase) at 30 °C for 5–12 h. Tissue localization of the blue reaction product was observed by light microscopy. For analysis of endogenous laminin-degrading proteinase activity, retinal extracts were prepared from different mouse treatment groups as described above. Equal amounts (20 μg) of specific extracts were then mixed as appropriate to the experiment and incubated for 2 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. To determine the capacity of GelB to initiate laminin degradation in retinal extracts, 50 ng of purified murine GelB (from Chemicon) was added to equal amounts of retinal extract (20 μg), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The GelB had been previously treated with the organo-mercurial, aminophenylmercuric acetate to convert the proenzyme to its active form (49Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20952-20957Google Scholar). For analysis of laminin content after incubation, all extracts were loaded onto 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred to nylon membranes and probed with anti-laminin antibodies as described above. As previously demonstrated in rats, optic nerve ligation in mice resulted in a striking decrease in retinal thickness. This was specifically due to a decrease in the total number of cells present in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and a reduction in the thickness of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) containing cytoplasmic extensions from these cells (Fig.1 A). In addition, there was a smaller reduction in the thickness of the inner nuclear layer (INL). TUNEL assay was performed over a time course of 1–4 days after surgery to learn whether cell loss was due to apoptosis. TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the retinal ganglion cell layer at all time points, with a peak at 2 days after optic nerve ligation (Fig. 1 B). Essentially no TUNEL-positive cells were found in control retinas. In addition to ganglion cells, the retinal ganglion cell layer also contains displaced amacrine cells, the end feet of glial and Muller cells, and any leukocytes that infiltrate in response to injury. To determine whether cells lost after optic nerve ligation were ganglion cells and to quantify their loss, we specifically marked these cells by injecting the site where their axons terminate in the brain (the superior colliculus) with the fluorescent tracer, FluoroGold. One week after injection, ganglion cells were FluoroGold-positive as a result of retrograde transport of the tracer (Fig. 1 C). Loss of FluoroGold-positive cells was observed as early as 2 days after optic nerve ligation, and cell loss was even greater after 7 days (Fig. 1,C and D). In contrast, the number of labeled cells remained unchanged in control retinas over the time course examined (Fig. 1, C and D). Optic nerve ligation leads to an increase in gelatinolytic metalloproteinase activity in the retinal ganglion cell layer and loss of laminin from the inner limiting membrane. An in situgelatinase activity assay was employed to compare the level of gelatinolytic activity in the normal and injured retina of CD-1 mice. Two days after optic nerve ligation, gelatinolytic activity was localized on tissue sections to the inner aspect of injured retinas, but this activity was not found in control retinas (Fig.2 A). No activity was observed when the procedure was performed on sections from injured retinas in the presence of 50 μm 1,10-phenanthroline. This is a metal ion chelator that inhibits MMPs due to its affinity for Zn2+, which is required for enzymatic activity (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that a gelatinolytic metalloproteinase activity appears in the inner retina after optic nerve ligation, co-localizing with ganglion cell apoptosis. Laminins are major extracellular matrix components of the inner limiting membrane of the ganglion cell layer (47Libby R.T. Xu Y. Selfors L.M. Brunken W.J. Hunter D.D. J. Comp.

Ubc9, the E2 for SUMO, synthesizes polymeric chains in the presence of its E1 and MgATP. To better understand conjugation of ub-lps, we have performed mutational analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ubc9p, which conjugates the SUMO family member Smt3p. We have identified Ubc9p surfaces involved in thiolester bond and Smt3p-Smt3p chain formation. The residues involved in thiolester bond formation map to a surface we show is the E1 binding site, and E2s for other ub-lps are likely to bind to their E1s at a homologous site. We also find that this same surface binds Smt3p. A mutation that impairs binding to E1 but not Smt3p impairs thiolester bond formation, suggesting that it is the E1 interaction at this site that is crucial. Interestingly, other E2s and their relatives also use this same surface for binding to ubiquitin, E3s, and other proteins, revealing this to be a multipurpose binding site and suggesting that the entire E1-E2-E3 pathway has coevolved for a given ub-lp.

The best understood function of these modifications is ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, in which polymeric chains containing four or more ubiquitins, linked between Lys-48 on the surface of one ubiquitin to the C terminus of the next, direct proteins for degradation by the proteasome (reviewed in Ref. 7Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar). Multiubiquitin chains with linkages via Lys-63, rather than Lys-48, activate the IκB kinase (8Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Google Scholar), and monoubiquitylation plays a role in processes ranging from protein trafficking to transcriptional activation (9Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Google Scholar). New ubiquitin-like proteins that are conjugated to macromolecules in vivo are being discovered at a rapid rate. For example, NEDD8 (Rub1p in budding yeast) is involved in cell cycle control (10Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J. Goebl M. Estelle M.

Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Google Scholar), and SUMO family members, including Smt3p in budding yeast, modify a number of proteins involved in cell division, nuclear transport, the stress response, and signal transduction (reviewed in Refs. 14Hay R.T.

All of these ub-lps are conjugated at their C termini to protein substrates by an enzymatic cascade with common features (11Liakopoulos D. Doenges G. Matuschewski K. Jentsch S.

Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Google Scholar). A number of ub-lps are processed proteolytically at their C termini to end with the sequence Gly-Gly, required for subsequent steps of the pathway. Ub-lps are adenylated at the C terminus by an activating enzyme or E1. The C terminus of the ub-lp subsequently forms a thiolester with the catalytic cysteine of E1. The ub-lp then forms a thiolester between its C terminus and the catalytic cysteine of a conjugating enzyme, or E2. The sequences of E1s are similar, and the structures of E2s and ub-lps are conserved, suggesting that the mechanisms of activation and thiolester bond formation will be similar for all ub-lps. There are three known mechanisms for transfer of the ub-lp to a lysine residue on the target. In many cases, transfer is facilitated by an E3 protein or protein complex that selects the target and acts as an ub-lp protein ligase (reviewed in Refs. 7Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar and 28Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Google Scholar). In the predominant mechanism of ubiquitin transfer, the E3 appears to act as a scaffold that recruits the target protein and the E2, facilitating ligation from the E2 to the target. For some E3s, ubiquitin forms a thiolester with the active site cysteine of an E3, which itself transfers ubiquitin. It is also possible for the E2 to transfer an ub-lp in the absence of an E3. For example, chimeric E2s for ubiquitin, fused to protein binding peptides, ubiquitylate the associated proteins (29Gosink M.M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9117-9121Google Scholar), and Ubc9 binds a number of its targets directly and transfers SUMO family members to a lysine in the tetrapeptide consensus motif ΨKX(D/E), where Ψ is hydrophobic (reviewed in Ref. 30Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Google Scholar). For ubiquitin there is one E1, tens of E2s, and hundreds of E3s playing a major role in substrate conjugation, although a number of ub-lps only have one known E2. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that E2s have evolved to orchestrate modification of proteins in a common pathway. For example, Rad6p and Cdc34p, which transfer ubiquitin, are involved in the DNA damage response and the G1-S transition of the cell cycle, respectively (31Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Google Scholar, 32Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Google Scholar). Ubc9p, which transfers Smt3p, is also involved in cell cycle control (22Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Google Scholar, 33Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S.

Therefore, the ability of a particular E2 to accept and transfer its ub-lp is crucial to the organization of the pathway. This involves E2 interaction with E1, thiolester bond formation with the ub-lp, interaction with the appropriate E3 and substrate, and catalysis of ub-lp transfer. Several recent structural studies have suggested the structural basis for E2 interactions with E3s (35Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Google Scholar, 36Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Google Scholar) and E2 interaction with ub-lps (37Miura T. Klaus W. Gsell B. Miyamoto C. Senn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 213-228Google Scholar, 38Liu Q. Jin C. Liao X. Shen Z. Chen D.J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16979-16987Google Scholar, 39Hamilton K.S. Ellison M.J. Barber K.R. Williams R.S. Huzil J.T. McKenna S. Ptak C. Glover M. Shaw G.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 897-904Google Scholar), and a recent structure has revealed the structural basis for substrate recognition by the E2 Ubc9 (40Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Google Scholar). Despite these structures, the mechanism of ub-lp transfer from E1 to E2 and from E2 to substrate is poorly understood. A particularly vexing question is how E2s form thiolester bonds with their cognate ub-lp. E1s are thought to bind tightly to E2s to promote thiolester bond formation (41Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13268-13275Google Scholar), but the E1 binding site has not been reported for any E2. We present here anin vitro mutational study of Ubc9p where we identify residues involved in E1 binding, Ubc9p-Smt3p thiolester bond formation, and Smt3p-Smt3p chain formation. The full-length wild-type clones of Smt3, Aos1, and Uba2 were obtained by PCR from yeast genomic DNA (Research Genetics). For all experiments described here, a truncated version of Smt3 terminating at Gly-98, representing the active form of Smt3p found in yeast, was used and is referred to as Smt3p. Two rounds of PCR were used to generate the full-length wild-type Ubc9 cDNA lacking the intron: first, the cDNA corresponding to the second exon was amplified from yeast genomic DNA (Research Genetics) with primers containing overlapping overhangs, and this PCR product was used as the template for a second PCR reaction with overlapping primers also encoding the first exon. The Ubc9 mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis. The sequences of all clones were verified by standard automated DNA sequencing procedures. PCR products encoding Smt3, Ubc9, and mutants were subcloned into pGEX4T3 (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed as GST fusions in BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The cDNAs encoding Aos1p and Uba2p were subcloned into a bicistronic vector described previously (42Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Google Scholar) and coexpressed in BL21(DE3) with Aos1p as a GST fusion. Untagged Uba2p forms a tight complex with GST·Aos1p and copurifies with Aos1p over every subsequent chromatographic step in the purification. The Aos1p/Uba2p complex is referred to as E1(S). GST·Smt3p, GST·Ubc9p, and GST·Aos1p/Uba2p were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography, and the fusion proteins were cleaved overnight on ice with thrombin. Cleavage was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Smt3p and Aos1p/Uba2p were purified further by anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and concentrated by ultrafiltration to ∼400 and ∼22 μm, respectively, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.6. Ubc9p and the mutants used for enzymatic assays were purified further by cation exchange chromatography in 50 mm HEPES, 350 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0, and concentrated to 50–600 μm. The proteins used for NMR were purified in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 350 mm NaCl, 1 mm deuterated DTT, pH 7.0. All proteins were aliquotted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further use. The Ubc9p mutants were adjusted to the same concentration for all subsequent biochemical assays in 50 mm HEPES, 350 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0. Thiolester bond formation assays were performed in 50-μl volumes containing 4.5 nmE1(S), 3.5 μm Smt3p, 2.2 μm Ubc9p or mutant, 24 mm ATP, and buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 160 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DTT). Reactions were incubated at room temperature for between 0 and 60 min as indicated in the figures. Reactions were terminated by boiling half of the reaction in nonreducing SDS sample buffer and the other half the reaction in SDS sample buffer containing DTT. Reactions products were fractionated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by Coomassie staining. The Ubc9p-Smt3p thiolester intermediate was identified preliminarily by susceptibility to reduction by DTT and subsequently confirmed by mass spectrometry following tryptic digestion (see below). Binding was determined by a native gel mobility shift assay. Binding was performed with 3 μm E1(S), 14 μm Ubc9p, and 4–32 μm Smt3p in 10 μl volumes in 75 mm Tris, 165 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm DTT, pH 7.6, for 1 h. Free and Ubc9p-bound E1(S) and Smt3p were separated on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bis, 37.5:1) in a buffer of 90 mm Tris borate, 2% glycerol, pH 8.0, and were visualized with Coomassie staining. Free Ubc9p does not enter the gel because of its net positive charge. The identity of components in the bands observed in native gel was confirmed by tryptic digestion followed by electrospray mass spectrometry (see below). Formation of Smt3p-Smt3p and Ubc9p-Smt3p conjugates was observed following incubation of 45 nm E1(S), 12 μm Smt3p, 4 μmUbc9p or mutant, 4 mm ATP, and buffer (30 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 190 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) in a volume of 40 μl. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for between 0 and 120 min as indicated in the figures. Reactions were terminated by boiling half of the reaction in SDS sample buffer containing DTT. Reaction products were fractionated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by Coomassie staining. The identity of proteins in the gel bands and the location of the Smt3p-Smt3p linkage was confirmed by mass spectrometry following tryptic digestion (see below). Following electrophoresis, Coomassie-stained proteins were excised from gels, reduced, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin. Samples from native gel shifts were digested in the gel first under denaturing conditions with lysyl endoproteinase in 8 murea, diluted to reduce the urea concentration to 2 m, and digested with trypsin. Peptides were extracted and subjected to mass spectrometry. For the Smt3p conjugation assays, peptide mass fingerprinting was performed by MALDI in a Voyager DE-RP TOF mass spectrometer from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as the matrix. More than 10 peptides confirm the presence of Smt3p and/or Ubc9p in the conjugates. For the native gel shift assays, digests were subjected to combined capillary liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry using an LCQ-Deca ion-trap mass spectrometer from ThermoFinnigan (San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source from New Objective (Woburn, MA). Collision-induced dissociation spectra were subjected to search using the SEQUEST program (ThermoFinnigan). Several peptides from Aos1p, Uba2p, Ubc9p, or Smt3p provided positive identification of the proteins in the bands observed in the native gel. Isopeptide bonds in the Smt3p-Smt3p and Ubc9p-Smt3p conjugates were localized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using in-gel digests made with endoproteinase Glu-C or chymotrypsin. Glu-C digests of Ubc9p-Smt3p contained a peptide of average mass 2,560.9 Da that was absent from free Smt3p and Ubc9p. Further, signals due to Smt3p C-terminal peptide 91–98 (average mass 866.9 Da) and Ubc9p C-terminal peptide 144–157 (average mass 1,712.0 Da) were absent from Ubc9p-Smt3p. These data are consistent with the presence of an isopeptide linkage between the α-carboxyl group of the Smt3p C-terminal glycine residue and any of four Ubc9p lysines, 146, 147, 153, and 157. However, chymotryptic digests of Ubc9p-Smt3p provided further information. They contained a peptide of average mass 2,560.3 Da that was absent from digests of free Smt3p and Ubc9p. The signal due to Smt3p C-terminal peptide 82–98 (average mass 1,943.0 Da) was diminished in intensity in the Ubc9p-Smt3p complex. These data are consistent with the presence of Ubc9p peptide 151–155 in the isopeptide-linked species, showing that the isopeptide bond occurs through Ubc9p Lys-153. The linkage in the Smt3p-Smt3p conjugate was established using Glu-C digests, which revealed a peptide of average mass 2,199.7 Da that was absent from free Smt3p. The signal due to peptide 10–21 (average mass 1,350.6 Da) was diminished in Smt3p-Smt3p. This result is consistent with an isopeptide linkage between peptides 10–21 and 91–98 (average mass 866.9 Da). This was confirmed by tandem TOF/TOF mass spectrometry using an Applied Biosystems model 4700 mass spectrometer, which further established unambiguously the involvement of Lys-15 in the linkage. 1H NMR data were acquired with a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer. One-dimensional spectra were acquired at 20 °C with a spectral width of 10,000 Hz, 4096 complex points, 512 transients, and a recycle delay of 1.3 s. The water peak was suppressed by Watergate. Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual water peak at 4.75 ppm. Resonances from residual glycerine from the Centricon (Millipore) membranes used for concentration also appear in the spectra. To identify the surfaces on Ubc9p available for mediating protein-protein interactions and catalysis, we performed structural analysis. Although the structure ofS. cerevisiae Ubc9p has not been determined, three crystal structures are available of the human ortholog (40Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Google Scholar, 43Tong H. Hateboer G. Perrakis A. Bernards R. Sixma T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21381-21387Google Scholar, 44Giraud M.F. Desterro J.M. Naismith J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 891-898Google Scholar), whose sequence is 56% identical to the yeast protein, with most of the differences being conservative substitutions. We first analyzed the crystal structures of human Ubc9 and compared them with the crystal structures of human UbcH7 (35Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Google Scholar, 36Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Google Scholar), which transfers ubiquitin. We reasoned that the residues involved in binding to E1 and SUMO family members should be conserved among Ubc9 family members but not among E2s that transfer ubiquitin, and residues involved in common features of catalysis should be conserved around the active sites of both types of E2s. We identified 62 residues that cover most protein-protein interaction sites on the surface and mutated these to either alanine or the corresponding residue in E2s that transfer ubiquitin and not Smt3p. Our goal was to make mutations that would disrupt protein-protein interactions or catalysis without significantly disrupting the structure. One of the greatest structural differences between Ubc9 and E2s that transfer ubiquitin is a five-residue insertion in the loop between β-strand 1 and β-strand 2 (43Tong H. Hateboer G. Perrakis A. Bernards R. Sixma T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21381-21387Google Scholar, 44Giraud M.F. Desterro J.M. Naismith J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 891-898Google Scholar), so some deletion mutants were also made that truncate this loop to the size of that found in E2s for ubiquitin to test the function of this loop. The location of amino acids that were mutated in this study is shown on the structure of human Ubc9 in Fig. 1. To identify regions of Ubc9p other than the active site cysteine required for activity, we developed an in vitro assay using purified recombinant Ubc9p, Smt3p, and the heterodimeric Aos1p/Uba2p complex, which is the E1 for Smt3p, hereafter referred to as E1(S). This assay is similar to that described previously for human Ubc9, with reactants and products separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining (18Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Google Scholar). The Ubc9p-Smt3p thiolester-linked complex migrates more slowly than either Ubc9p or Smt3p alone and is susceptible to reduction by DTT. At later time points, or at higher protein concentration, Ubc9p automodifies and forms a nonreducible isopeptide linkage with Smt3p, as is found for a number of other E2s (39, 45, 46; see below). We assayed the time course of thiolester bond formation for 36 mutants of Ubc9p, with a total of 62 residues mutated either individually or in combination, and the results are shown in Fig.2. Only one variant with these mutations close to the active site, E99S, D100S, D102S, showed accelerated automodifying activity, forming a nonreducible linkage by the 60-min time point. Mutations most strongly hindering thiolester bond formation map to a distinct surface of Ubc9p, involving the C-terminal portion of the N-terminal helix and the loop between the first and second β-strands. This includes the following mutants: K14E, K14E/R17A/K18A, V29A/K30D/32–34Δ, 32–34Δ, and 34Δ37Δ, where Δ stands for a deletion. Although R17A and K18A have no effect on their own, these mutations further reduce the ability of the K14E mutant to form a thiolester bond. These mutations all map to a distinct surface distal from the active site. Because of the essential role that activating enzymes play in transferring ub-lps to E2s, we wanted to know whether this surface is involved in binding to E1(S). In addition, previous yeast 2-hybrid and NMR studies have shown that Ubc9 family members interact noncovalently with SUMO family members (38Liu Q. Jin C. Liao X. Shen Z. Chen D.J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16979-16987Google Scholar, 47Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Google Scholar, 48Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A.

A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Google Scholar), and this region overlaps with the region of human Ubc9 identified previously (38Liu Q. Jin C. Liao X. Shen Z. Chen D.J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16979-16987Google Scholar) by NMR as the SUMO-1 binding site. Therefore, we tested whether these or other mutations in Ubc9p impair noncovalent binding to either E1(S) or to Smt3p. To address whether mutations that impair thiolester bond formation are important for Ubc9p binding to E1(S) or Smt3p, we developed a nondenaturing gel mobility shift assay to examine protein-protein interactions between E1(S) and Ubc9p and Smt3p and Ubc9p. Briefly, E1(S) and Smt3p are acidic, so they enter a native gel at pH 8. However, the pI of Ubc9p and all of the mutants in this study is greater than 8, so they do not enter a pH 8 gel. Binding between E1(S) and Ubc9p, or Smt3p and Ubc9p, is reflected by a slower mobility in the gel (Fig.3, A and B, respectively). We tested the ability of all of the Ubc9p mutants to bind to E1(S) and Smt3p (summarized in TableI). Using this approach we identified the E1(S) binding site on Ubc9p to correspond to the surface important for Smt3p thiolester bond formation, involving the N-terminal helix and the loop between β-strands 1 and 2. To our surprise, the binding sites for E1(S) and Smt3p partially overlap each other, as this region is also involved in noncovalent interactions with Smt3p, consistent with a previous NMR study of human Ubc9 and SUMO-1 (38Liu Q. Jin C. Liao X. Shen Z. Chen D.J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16979-16987Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that mutations such as K14E, which impair thiolester bond formation and binding to both E1(S) and Smt3p, lead to a protein folding defect, we examined the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the K14E mutant (Fig.4). The spectrum contains extensive chemical shift dispersion, including resonances shifted upfield of 0 ppm and downfield of 10 ppm that resemble those of the wild-type protein. These features indicate proper folding.Table IE1(S) and Smt3p binding by Ubc9p mutantsUbc9pE1(S)Smt3pUbc9pE1(S)Smt3pWT++++++N98A++++++K14E−−Q101A++++++R17A+−E99S/D100S/D102S+++NDK18A++K110S/Q111K++++++F22A/G23Q/Y25S+++−D118A/S122A++++++V29A/K30D−−N124A++++++V29A/K30D 32–34Δ−−N126A++++++32–34Δ++++S127A++++++34Δ,37Δ−++W134A/S136A/R139S++++++Q39A/K40A/E42A++++++N140A/A142E/E143K++++++K48A/E49A++++++D145A/K146A/K147N++++++A54E/G55D++++++L149E/L150E/Q154A++++++P59A/T61A/E63A+++++R104S/P105A/A106R++++++P65A/N66A++++++K14E/R17A/K18A−−K74A/K76A++++++S70G++++++P78T/A79T++++++S70F++++++Y87F++++++Q7R++++++P88S/S89A/T91A++++++E11K+++++WT, wild type; ND, not determined.

Because the binding sites for E1(S) and Smt3p are partially overlapping, we tested whether Smt3p can compete with E1(S) for binding to Ubc9p. We first tested whether Smt3p interacts with E1(S) using our native gel shift assay and gel filtration chromatography (data not shown), and we see no evidence for interaction in the absence of MgATP, consistent with classic findings for the E1 for ubiquitin (50Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Google Scholar, 51Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Google Scholar). We mixed 3 μm E1(S) with 14 μm Ubc9p and observed complex formation by native gel. We then titrated increasing amounts of Smt3p into the mixture (4, 8, 16, and 32 μm) and observed two different noncovalent complexes by native gel, Ubc9p/E1(S) and Ubc9p/Smt3p. With increasing concentrations of Smt3p, the E1(S)/Ubc9p complex is displaced and replaced by the Ubc9p/Smt3p complex (Fig.5). This demonstrates that Smt3p and E1(S) bind to overlapping sites on Ubc9p. Because the binding sites for Smt3p and E1(S) on Ubc9p are partially overlapping, we wanted to determine which interaction is important for thiolester bond formation. We could distinguish between the importance of interacting with Smt3p and the importance of interacting with E1(S) with two mutants that show distinct binding behavior; the F22A/G23Q/Y25S mutant binds to E1(S) but not Smt3p, and the 32–34Δ and 34,37Δ mutants bind to Smt3p but not E1(S). Even though the 32–34Δ and 34,37Δ mutants show wild-type binding to Smt3p, they are impaired severely for their ability to form thiolester bonds with Smt3p. This contrasts with the F22A/G23Q/Y24S mutant, which shows wild-type levels of thiolester bond formation, even though it does not bind noncovalently to Smt3p. Thus, noncovalent E1(S) binding by this region, and not Smt3p binding, is likely to be crucial for Ubc9p-Smt3p thiolester bond formation. Recently,"

The clinical hallmark is a prolongation of the QT interval, which reflects a delay in repolarization caused by mutations in cardiac ion channel genes. Mutations in the HERG (humane ther-à-go-go-relatedgene KCNH2 can cause a reduction in IKr, one of the currents responsible for cardiac repolarization. We describe the identification and characterization of a novel missense mutation T65P in the PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain of HERG, resulting in defective trafficking of the protein to the cell membrane. Defective folding of the mutant protein could be restored by decreased cell incubation temperature and pharmacologically by cisapride and E-4031. When trafficking was restored by growing cells at 27 °C, the kinetics of the mutated channel resembled that of wild-type channels although the rate of activation, deactivation, and recovery from inactivation were accelerated. No positive evidence for the formation of heterotetramers was obtained by co-expression of wild-type with mutant subunits at 37 °C. As a consequence the clinical symptoms may be explained rather by haploinsufficiency than by dominant negative effects. This study is the first to relate a PAS domain mutation in HERG to a trafficking deficiency at body temperature, apart from effects on channel deactivation.

Congenital long QT syndrome (cLQTS) 1The abbreviations used are: cLQTS, congenital long QT syndrome; LQTS, long QT syndrome; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WT, wild-type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney. is a disorder of the electrical system of the heart. The disorder manifests itself by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram and by a propensity for tachyarrhythmias causing syncopes and sudden death (1Priori S.G. Barhanin J. Hauer R.N.

The HERG (humane ther-à-go-go-relatedgene) KCNH2, encoding the α-subunit of the voltage-gated potassium channel HERG, is one of five genes linked to this disease. The HERG potassium channel has been shown to encode the α-subunits of the cardiac rapidly activating, delayed rectifying current IKr (2Warmke J.E. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 91: 3438-3442Google Scholar), which plays an important role in the repolarization of the cardiac action potential (3Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T.

Although the role of other factors contributing to IKr current, such asKCNH2 splice variants (5Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar), is still under investigation, it is clear that mutations in theKCNH2 gene are one of the most common causes of congenital LQTS. In most cases these mutations reduce the outward potassium current during repolarization and thus lengthen the action potential duration, which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (9Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Google Scholar). More than one hundred different mutations in the KCNH2 gene have been described for cLQTS families including frameshifts, deletions, insertions, and missense and nonsense mutations (10Jongbloed R.J. Wilde A.A. Geelen J.L. Doevendans P. Schaap C. Van Langen I. van Fintelen J.P. Cobben J.M. Beaufort-Krol G.C. Geraedts J.P. Smelts H.J. Hum. Mut. 1999; 13: 301-310Google Scholar, 11Splawski I.

There is a great deal of genetic evidence that the mutations identified are the cause of the disease in the different families; however, in many cases the molecular mechanism by which channel function is disrupted has not been identified unequivocally. Thus far, all except one (12Lees-Miller J.P. Duan Y. Teng G.Q. Thorstad K. Duff H.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 507-513Google Scholar) of the mutant HERG channels characterized cause a net reduction in outward potassium current during repolarization through loss of function. The latter may result from different mechanisms including non-functionality (13Nakajima T. Kurabayashi M. Ohyama Y. Kaneko Y. Furukawa T. Itoh T. Taniguchi Y. Tanaka T. Nakamura Y. Hiraoka M.

Especially this last category of mutants has become a focus of interest recently, because such mutant subunits may display WT properties once they are inserted in the cell membrane. Defective protein processing has been described for other congenital human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (23Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 258: 761-764Google Scholar, 24Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Google Scholar, 25Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Google Scholar). In these diseases, the mutation causes very subtle differences in protein folding that lead to ER retention. However, lower cell incubation temperatures or chemical chaperones could restore trafficking in these cases. Thus far, six trafficking-deficient mutations have been described in the KCNH2 gene (see Fig. 1 and Refs. 18Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Google Scholar, 19Furutani M. Trudeau M.C. Hagiwara N. Seki A. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Imamura S. Nagashima H. Kasanuki H. Takao A. Momma K. January C.T. Roberton G.A. Matsuoka R.

These mutations reside in different regions of the HERG protein and seem to determine temperature- or chemical chaperone-dependent rescue. For example, trafficking of mutant channels G601S, N470D, and R752W (19Furutani M. Trudeau M.C. Hagiwara N. Seki A. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Imamura S. Nagashima H. Kasanuki H. Takao A. Momma K. January C.T.

Cardiol. 2000; 32: 2327-2337Google Scholar) was not rescued by either temperature or chemical chaperones and even expressed a dominant negative effect on wild-type current. In this study, we describe the identification of a novel missense mutation 193A→C in exon 2 of the KCNH2 gene in a case of congenital long QT syndrome. This mutation is located in the N-terminal PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain of the HERG protein and leads to amino acid substitution T65P (threonine to proline). Previous studies have focused on this N-terminal PAS domain, because it may interact with the S4-S5 linker, thereby controlling channel deactivation (15Chen J. Zou A. Splawski I. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10113-10118Google Scholar, 26Morais-Cabral J.H. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B. Li M. Mackinnon R. Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Google Scholar). Using functional analysis, we demonstrate that the T65P HERG protein also displayed an accelerated deactivation but only if it was transported to the cell membrane. The primary dysfunction of the T65P mutation was a trafficking deficiency and therefore may provide new information on additional functions of this protein domain. The pedigree of the Caucasian family in which the cLQTS was diagnosed is shown in Fig. 3A. Five of the family members (subjects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) are being treated with β-blockers because of a prolonged QT interval. Subject 2 has suffered from a cardiovascular collapse at the age of 25 but was successfully resuscitated. Apart from an aberrant electrocardiogram pattern (sinus tachycardia, diffuse repolarization disturbances) subject 3 is asymptomatic. Because of the abnormal electrocardiogram pattern and the highly extended QT intervals, subject 4 and her daughter (subject 6) are being treated with β-blockers. Moreover, subject 6 suffered numerous syncopic episodes in the past. Subject 5 died suddenly at the age of 31 shortly after the start of an antibiotic treatment for otitis, which is highly suggestive for drug-induced LQTS. Subject 7, a sister of subject 1, has died suddenly at the age of 42 years. Finally, no information is available for two additional sisters of subject 1. Informed consent for genetic analysis was given prior to the collection of blood samples for DNA extraction from subjects 1, 2, and 3. Samples from other family members were not available for genetic testing analysis. The DNA of subject 1 was screened for all currently known long QT genes, KCNQ1 (LQT1, KvLQT1),KCNH2 (LQT2, HERG), SCN5A (LQT3, SCN5A),KCNE1 (LQT5, MinK), and KCNE2 (LQT6, MiRP1). PCR primers used for amplification of individual exons were described previously (8Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A.N. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar, 27Neyroud N. Richard P. Vignier N. Donger C. Denjoy I. Demay L. Shkolnikova M. Pesce R. Chevalier P. Hainque B. Coumel P. Schwartz K. Guicheney P. Circ.

Genomics. 1998; 51: 86-97Google Scholar). PCR products were sequenced directly and aligned with the respective wild-type sequences to detect genetic variations. A PCR-RFLP assay was designed for the detection of the identified mutation 193A→C (T65P) in exon 2 of the KCNH2 gene (see Fig. 3,B and C). Primers used were 5′-CAC-GCG-CAC-TCT-CCT-CAC-CG-3′ (MG430; forward) and 5′-CGC-CCC-GGC-CCG-CTC-CTA-C-3′ (MG431; reverse). The PCR mix of 30 μl consisted of 1× PCR buffer II, 200 nm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 250 nm of each primer, 0.75 units of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase, and ∼100 ng of genomic DNA. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 10 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C (45 s), 60 °C (45 s), 72 °C (45 s), and a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR product of 278 bp was digested with restriction enzyme BspMI. A control group of 90 anonymous, healthy volunteers (180 alleles) was screened with the PCR-RFLP test for the T65P mutation. The wild-type HERG/pcDNA3 (HERG-WT) expression construct was kindly donated by Dr. Craig January and Dr. Zhengfeng Zhou (University of Wisconsin-Madison). Mutant T65P-HERG/pcDNA3 (HERG-T65P) was created using the GeneEditorTM in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer 5′-AGT-CGC-AGG- GGC-AGG-GTC-G-3′ was used as the synthetic oligonucleotide to create the mutant HERG cDNA (mutation is bold and underlined). The introduction of mutation 193A → C (T65P) in the wild-type HERG cDNA was verified by direct sequencing. Wild-type (WT-GFP) and mutant T65P HERG cDNA (T65P-GFP) were subcloned downstream of the coding region of a GFP in expression vector pcDNA3.1_NT_GFP (Invitrogen) using restriction sites KpNI and EcoRI. The ATG start codon of theKCNH2 cDNA was 24 bp downstream of the final GFP codon. The complete sequence of the constructs, encoding the in-frame fusion GFP-HERG protein, was verified using direct sequencing. HEK293 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1%l-glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. HEK293 cells were transfected stably with FUGENE transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Between five and ten HERG WT/pcDNA3 or HERG T65P/pcDNA3 stable cell lines were selected by their G-418 resistance, and the level of HERG protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis using a HERG-specific antibody (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). Cell lines with the highest HERG protein expression were used for follow-up experiments. Membrane protein preparation and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (30Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Google Scholar). Membrane proteins isolated from the stable cell lines, cultured at 37 °C, were subjected to 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HERG antibody at the recommended dilution. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-bound protein was detected with an ECL+Plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). To study defects in biosynthetic processing of the T65P mutant protein, Western blot procedures were repeated at an incubation temperature of 27 °C. The effects of channel blocking agents cisapride and E-4031 on HERG protein trafficking were studied at 37 °C in a concentration range between 0 and 10 μm. HEK293 cells were cultivated as described in the previous section but on cover slips. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of either WT-GFP or T65P-GFP constructs. In addition, 0.1 μg of a red fluorescent marker for the endoplasmic reticulum (DsRed-ER) was cotransfected to distinguish between ER-retained and membrane-bound proteins (31Ottschytsch N. Raes A. Van Hoorick D. Snyders D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7986-7991Google Scholar). Confocal images were obtained 48 h after transfection on a Zeiss CLSM 510, equipped with an argon laser for the visualization of GFP- and DsRed-tagged proteins. HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 or at 27 °C when indicated. Current recordings were made with an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) in the whole cell configuration using suction pipettes as described previously (32Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar). Glass patch pipettes were pulled with a P2000 laser puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) from 1.2-mm Starbore borosilicate glass (Radnoti, Monrovia, CA) and had resistances between 1.5 and 3.5 megohms. All currents were recorded at room temperature (20–22 °C) and were sampled at 1 to 10 kHz with a Digidata 1200A data acquisition system (Axon Instruments) after appropriate low pass filtering. Command voltages and data storage were controlled with pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments). Cells were perfused with HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.35 with NaOH). The internal pipette solution contained 110 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K2ATP, 5 mm K4 N,N′-(1,2-ethanediylbis(oxy-2,1-phenylene))bis(N-(carboxymethyl)), tetrapotassium salt, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH). After seal formation and establishing the whole cell configuration, the access resistance varied between 2.5 and 8 megohms. Series resistance was compensated to ensure that voltage errors were <5 mV. No leak subtraction was applied, and the holding potential was −80 mV unless noted otherwise. The voltage protocols are presented in the figure legends. The voltage dependence of channel activation was fitted with a Boltzmann equation according to y = 1/{1 + exp [−(E − V½)/k]}, where V½ represents the voltage at which 50% of the channels are open, and krepresents the slope factor. Activation, deactivation, and recovery from inactivation kinetics were fitted with a single or double exponential function using a non-linear least squares (Gauss-Newton) algorithm. Data are presented as mean ± S.E., and the Student'st test was used for statistical analysis; nrepresents the number of cells. Mutation screening by direct sequencing revealed a novel mutation in exon 2 of the KCNH2gene in the DNA of subject 1. This missense mutation, changing base pair 193 from A to C, leads to an amino acid change from a threonine to a proline (T65P) and is located in the N-terminal PAS domain of the KCNH2 gene (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). A PCR-RFLP assay was developed, based on the loss of recognition site by restriction enzyme BspMI because of the mutation. In the presence of the 193A → C (T65P) mutation, a recognition site for restriction enzyme BspMI is lost and results in a 278-bp product. In the absence of the mutation, the PCR product is cut in two fragments of 155 and 123 bp, respectively. All three available LQTS family members (subjects 1, 2, and 3) were found to be heterozygous carriers of this mutation (Fig. 3), whereas the mutation was not found in a control population of 90 healthy unrelated volunteers. It has been shown previously that expression of the wild-type HERG protein in HEK293 cells results in two distinct bands on Western blot analysis; the upper band of 155 kDa represents the complexly glycosylated mature form of the HERG channel inserted in the cell membrane whereas the lower band (135 kDa) represents the immature core-glycosylated form of the HERG channel retained in the ER (30Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Google Scholar). Upon Western blot analysis, the T65P protein incubated at 37 °C for 24 h resulted only in the lower 135-kDa band, whereas the wild-type protein resulted in both bands (Fig. 4A). However, the mature 155-kDa band was detected after a decrease in incubation temperature to 27 °C for at least 24 h (Fig. 4A), indicating that trafficking was restored. The stable HERG T65P cell line was also incubated with 2, 5, and 10 μm HERG channel blocking agents cisapride and E-4031. Both agents were able to restore trafficking of the T65P protein in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B), as assessed from the appearance of the 155-kDa protein. To confirm Western blotting results, GFP was tagged to the N terminus of HERG subunits and expressed in HEK293 cells. Subcellular trafficking of WT-GFP and T65P-GFP was investigated after incubation for 48 h at 37 or 27 °C. A red fluorescent endoplasmic reticulum (DsRed-ER) vector was co-transfected to distinguish between HERG protein retained in the ER and membrane-bound HERG proteins. Confocal images (Fig. 5) clearly show the presence of WT channels in the plasma membrane (Fig. 5, A and B), as well as in the ER (37 °C), whereas the T65P mutant protein (37 °C) was present exclusively in the ER (Fig. 5, C and D). Upon incubation at 27 °C, however, trafficking of mutant T65P HERG protein was restored, and the protein was incorporated in the cell membrane, as evidenced by the selective green fluorescence at the level of the plasma membrane (Fig. 5, E and F). Because Western blot analysis and confocal imaging suggested dysfunctional trafficking of T65P mutant to the cell membrane, we performed whole cell patch clamp recordings on stable WT and T65P cells to study the functional expression. Fig. 6 shows representative current recordings for WT and T65P channels. T65P stable cells only generated small currents (Fig. 6C) as compared with WT stable cells after incubation at 37 °C. Incubating T65P cells at 27 °C for 24 h increased T65P current density significantly (Fig. 6D), suggesting temperature-dependent trafficking of T65P proteins. The voltage dependence of activation was determined for WT and T65P channels (grown at 37 and 27 °C) by plotting the maximum tail current amplitude at −40 mV (Fig. 6) as a function of the prepulse voltage. These data were fit with a Boltzmann function, which revealed no significant differences in the mid-point potential (V½) and slope factor (k) between WT and T65P channels (Fig. 7A). To determine the time constants of activation, deactivation, and recovery from inactivation, current traces were fit with a single or double exponential function as appropriate. The kinetics for T65P cells grown at 27 °C were analyzed over the whole voltage range, whereas for cells grown at 37 °C the current amplitudes were too small for full analysis. At voltages resulting in the highest current amplitudes, the current kinetics of T65P cells grown at 37 °C were comparable with the kinetics of T65P cells grown at 27 °C (data not shown). Time constants for activation and deactivation are presented in Fig. 7C. T65P channels (27 °C) activated and deactivated faster than WT channels. The time constants for recovery from inactivation are presented in Fig. 7D. Recovery from inactivation was also faster for T65P channels than WT channels. Co-expression of WT and mutant T65P was performed by transient transfection of the T65P-pcDNA3 construct on the WT stable cell line. Maximum tail current amplitudes, as obtained according to the pulse protocol in Fig. 6, were compared with maximum tail current amplitudes from stable WT cells alone. In cells grown at 37 °C, no increase in HERG current density was observed whereas cells grown at 27 °C displayed a significant increase in HERG current density (Fig. 8). These results suggest that WT subunits do not interact with T65P subunits at 37 °C. A novel cLQTS-causing mutation, T65P in the KCNH2 gene, was detected in a Caucasian LQTS family. Two sudden deaths occurred in this family indicating a high risk for development of lethal arrhythmias. Three members participating in the study were all heterozygous carriers of this mutation whereas the mutation was not detected in a control group of 90 individuals (Fig. 3). Previously, characterized KCNH2 mutations have been shown to cause a reduction in IKr current in the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. This reduction in IKr current can be the result of different mechanisms. Mutant channels, such as A561V, S818L, and Y667X, can cause a complete loss of function (9Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Google Scholar, 13Nakajima T. Kurabayashi M. Ohyama Y. Kaneko Y. Furukawa T. Itoh T. Taniguchi Y. Tanaka T. Nakamura Y. Hiraoka M. Nagai R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 197-203Google Scholar, 33Paulussen A. Yang P. Pangalos M. Verhasselt P. Marrannes R. Verfaille C. Vandenberk I. Crabbe R. Konings F. Luyten W. Armstrong M. Hum. Mut. 2000; 15: 483Google Scholar), whereas other mutated channels can form functional channels but with altered gating kinetics (16Nakajima T. Furukawa T. Hirano Y. Tanaka T. Sakurada H. Takahashi T. Nagai R. Itoh T. Katayama Y. Nakamura Y. Hiraoka M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 44: 283-293Google Scholar). Recently, a third mechanism for dysfunctional behavior of mutant HERG proteins was described involving protein trafficking (18Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Google Scholar, 19Furutani M. Trudeau M.C. Hagiwara N. Seki A. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Imamura S. Nagashima H. Kasanuki H. Takao A. Momma K. January C.T. Roberton G.A. Matsuoka R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2290-2294Google Scholar). It was proposed that these mutations prevented correct protein folding such that these proteins fail the “quality control” and are retained in the ER. In the present study, the Western blot analysis of the T65P mutant protein showed a single 135-kDa band, whereas WT HERG protein normally shows two bands (Fig. 4A), the immature, core-glycosylated protein synthesized in the ER (135 kDa) and the further developed, fully glycosylated, mature protein that is incorporated in the cell membrane (155 kDa). Such aberrant trafficking was described initially for the HERG mutants Y611H and V822M by Zhou et al. (18Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Google Scholar). A later study by the same group (20Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Google Scholar) demonstrated that defective trafficking could be restored by lowering incubation temperatures (27 °C) of the cell culture or by treatment with HERG channel blocking drugs such as cisapride or E-4031. Also in the case of T65P we observed that trafficking of the mutant protein could be restored by both lower incubation temperatures and pharmacological drugs (Fig. 4B). The latter pharmacological chaperone “rescue” of mutant HERG proteins has opened the first door towards therapy. Ficker et al. (34Ficker E. Obejero-Paz C.A. Zhao S. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4989-4998Google Scholar) demonstrated that rescue of trafficking-deficient HERG proteins can be domain-restricted and that potency of drug-related rescue was linked directly to channel block potency. However, Rajamani et al. (35Rajamani S. Anderson C.L. Anson B.D. January C.T. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2830-2835Google Scholar) showed very recently that at least for some misprocessed HERG proteins, fexofenadine had a more that 300-fold higher affinity toward HERG channel rescue than block. In this study it appeared that only misprocessed proteins that showed small currents at 37 °C could be rescued, but the ones that showed no current at all at 37 °C could not. Because the T65P protein also showed small currents at 37 °C, fexofenadine might also restore trafficking of this mutated channel. Interestingly, the novel T65P mutation resides in the N-terminal end of the HERG protein, which was shown to possess a so-called PAS domain (36Zhulin I.B. Taylor B.L. Dixon R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 331-333Google Scholar). Although this domain displays large amino acid sequence diversity in several proteins, it was, however, proposed as a domain family (36Zhulin I.B. Taylor B.L. Dixon R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 331-333Google Scholar,37Pellequer J.L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Google Scholar). In HERG the N-terminal residues from Ser-26 to Lys-135 were crystallized (26Morais-Cabral J.H. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B. Li M. Mackinnon R. Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Google Scholar). A database search revealed a high similarity with the three-dimensional structure of the PAS domain containing photoactive yellow protein (37Pellequer J.L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Google Scholar) although the sequence similarity is low. The crystal structure contains five antiparallel β-sheet strands pressed against a long strand, composed of a coil and one turn of a 310 helix with three α-helices on the sides. The substitution of the threonine by a proline could have several consequences on HERG channels. 1) The T65P mutation is located just before the single turn of the 310 helix, which might affect the formation of this helix. 2) A putative hydrogen bond between the Thr-65 with Asp-67 would not be possible with the proline substitution and could destabilize the structure of the N terminus. 3) Although residue Thr-65 is located in a more or less loosely packed region of the N terminus, it cannot be excluded that steric hindrance induced by the rigid proline side chain could cause misfolding. 4) Any of the above effects could affect the local structure of the long strand. The latter, containing the 310 helix and Thr-65, connects the α-helices located at both sides of the sheet of β-strands. A distortion of this connector could then change the three-dimensional structure in other parts, e.g. the sheet of β-strands. The PAS domain in HERG is highly conserved among species (Fig. 2). Previously it was shown that removal of the N-terminal end, including the PAS domain, accelerates channel deactivation (38Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Google Scholar, 39Schönherr R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 635-642Google Scholar). Furthermore, splice variants that lack a part of the N-terminal domain display a faster deactivation rate (6London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler N.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Google Scholar, 7Lees-Miller J.P. Kondo C. Wang L. Duff H.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 719-726Google Scholar). A similar effect on the deactivation rate was observed with mutations in the S4-S5 linker, and it was suggested that this linker and the PAS domain might interact (17Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 514: 667-675Google Scholar, 39Schönherr R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 635-642Google Scholar) as was demonstrated for eag channels (40Terlau H. Heinemann S.H. Stühmer W. Pongs O. Ludwig J. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 537-543Google Scholar). Using an oocyte expression system Chen et al. (15Chen J. Zou A. Splawski I. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10113-10118Google Scholar) investigated the effects of several long QT-associated PAS domain mutations on deactivation kinetics and showed for eight mutations that HERG channel deactivation was accelerated, although to a different extent. The novel T65P mutation was analyzed with a mammalian expression system at 37 °C and also revealed some accelerating effect on channel deactivation, but we consider this effect of secondary importance compared with the trafficking deficiency displayed by the T65P mutant protein. Chenet al. (15Chen J. Zou A. Splawski I. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10113-10118Google Scholar) did not report trafficking deficiency in their study as the typical low incubation temperature of oocytes might have concealed trafficking deficiency. It is therefore conceivable that some of these eight mutant proteins may be deficient in trafficking at 37 °C. This hypothesis is supported by the results of Fickeret al. (21Ficker E. Thomas D. Viswanathan P.C. Dennis A.T. Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Memmi M. Wible B.A. Kaufman E.S. Iyengar S. Schwartz P.J. Rudy Y. Brown A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1748-H1756Google Scholar), who showed large currents for a trafficking-deficient HERG protein (R752W) in the oocyte expression system as compared with the lack of current in the mammalian expression system. A functional HERG channel is composed of four α-subunit proteins, encoded by the KCNH2 gene, forming a tetramer. Most LQTS patients have the dominant Romano-Ward form, inheriting one wild-type allele and one mutant allele. Therefore, the best approach to mimic the phenotypic result of the genetic profile of these patients is the study of co-expression of WT cDNA with mutant cDNA. In some cases the ability of mutant HERG proteins to form heterotetramers with wild-type subunits is lost, leading to haploinsufficiency. In other cases, interaction of WT subunits with mutant subunits leads to alterations in the biophysical properties or amplitude of the assembled ion channel, causing a dominant negative effect. Although the gating kinetics of T65P channels were slightly different from WT channels, it is most likely that the prolonged QT interval is caused by a reduction of IKr by ER retention of the T65P subunits. The co-expression of T65P with WT subunits at 37 °C, mimicking the actual genotype of the patients, showed no significant differences in current density or kinetics as compared with WT expression alone (Fig. 8). This result indicates that T65P and WT subunits do not form heterotetramers; indeed, a decreased current density should have been observed upon ER retention of heterotetramers of WT and T65P, or an increased current density should have been observed upon incorporation in the cell membrane of these heterotetramers. Whether the increased current density of co-transfected WT and T65P subunits at 27 °C is caused by heterotetramers or separate WT and T65P homotetramers remains to be investigated. In summary, genetic analysis revealed a novel mutation (T65P), located in the PAS domain of HERG, that causes trafficking deficiency of the protein and leads clinically to the long QT syndrome. This study suggests that a correctly folded PAS domain has a major role in proper trafficking of the (tetrameric) channel complex. Furthermore, these results indicate that analysis of KCNH2 mutations in oocytes may at best be insufficient to delineate all possible molecular mechanisms by which the mutation can cause the disease.

Although tumor growth of small cell lung cancer is mainly mediated by neuropeptides such as bombesin-related peptides that bind to G protein-coupled receptor, the major autocrine/paracrine loops for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 1The abbreviations used are: NSCLC, non-small cell lung carcinoma; AR, amphiregulin; CM, conditioned medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor; IGF1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IGF1-R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor; IGF2, insulin-like growth factor-2; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay1The abbreviations used are: NSCLC, non-small cell lung carcinoma; AR, amphiregulin; CM, conditioned medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor; IGF1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IGF1-R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor; IGF2, insulin-like growth factor-2; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cells involve growth factors that bind to tyrosine kinase receptors (2Rozengurt E.

The erbB receptor family contains four distinct members: the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, erbB-1/HER1), erbB-2/neu (HER2), erbB-3 (HER3), and erbB-4 (HER4). These receptors consist of an extracellular domain containing the ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain conferring tyrosine kinase activity (3Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Binding of specific ligands induces homo- or heterodimerization of the receptors within members of the erbB family (4Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and activates distinct intracellular signal transduction pathways and biological responses, including cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. Five ligands of EGFR, the epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor α (TGFα), amphiregulin (AR), heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) and betacellulin, can be produced by tumorigenic and, to a lesser extent, by non-tumorigenic human lung epithelial cells (5Rusch V.

As most cells of epithelial origin, NSCLC cells overexpress members of the erbB receptor family, in particular the EGFR and erbB-2/neu, but the prognostic impact of this overexpression is still controversial (5Rusch V.

Overexpression of TGFα and AR has been associated with shortened survival of patients with NSCLC (5Rusch V. Klimstra D. Venkatraman E. Pisters P.W. Langenfeld J. Dmitrovsky E. Clin.

Type 1 insulin like-growth factor receptor (IGF1-R) is also expressed in human lung tumors (10Moody T.W. Cuttitta F.

The IGF1-R is composed of two extracellular α subunits with the ligand-binding domain and two β subunits that contain a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain with the tyrosine kinase activity. IGF1-R binds insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and IGF2. High levels of circulating IGF1 detected in patients with lung cancers (12Grimberg A. Cohen P. J. Cell.

Thus, the IGF1/IGF1-R pathway transactivates the EGFR via an autocrine release of EGF-like factors (37Vardy D.A. Kari C. Lazarus G.S. Jensen P.J. Zilberstein A. Plowman G.D. Rodeck U. J. Cell.

Although the role of IGF1-R and EGFR pathways in growth and survival of lung cancer cells is well understood, their mechanism of action and cooperation are poorly understood. In this report, we analyzed the inhibition of serum deprivation apoptosis in two NSCLC cell lines, H358 and H322, and showed that a reciprocal activation of AR and IGF1 pathways induced cell survival. Indeed, we show here that AR phosphorylates the IGF1-R and that the subsequent activation of IGF1-R pathway induces the secretion of AR and IGF1. Transactivation of the IGF1R by AR is independent of EGFR. Subsequent cross-talk between those growth factors and receptors activates a survival pathway in NSCLC cell lines. The human H358, H322, A549, HEL, K562, and Jurkat cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium; H69, H1417, and H2170 cells in RPMI medium supplemented with glucose (2.5 μg/liter), HEPES (10 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm); CALU-1 and SAOS cells in McCoy's medium; MCF7 and HeLa cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; H810, H720, and H2106 cells in Hite's medium; and NHBE cells in SAGM medium. Media were supplemented with 10 or 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All products were purchased from Invitrogen (Cergy Pontoise, France). For serum deprivation, cells were rinsed once in PBS and cultured for at least 8 h in serum-free medium, which was then changed, and the culture continued in serum-free medium or in serum-free conditioned medium for the desired time. Conditioned media (CM) from cells were collected 72 h after serum-free culture, centrifuged (5000 ×g) at 4 °C, and stored at −80 °C until use. Tyrphotins AG556, AG1024, or AG1295 (Alexis Biochemical, Laufelfingen, Switzerland), quinazolin ZD1839 (Iressa, kindly provided by Dr. R. Defrance, Astra-Zeneca, Rueil-Malmaison, France), and CRM197 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) were dissolved in Me2SO; tyrphotin AG825 (Alexis Biochemical) was dissolved in Me2SO/methanol (v/v); and 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ethanol and kept at −20 °C until use. AR and IGF1 recombinant proteins (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in fresh medium just before use. Anti-human EGF or AR mouse monoclonal, anti-human TGFα, betacellulin, or IGF2 goat polyclonal (R&D Systems Europe, Ltd., Abingdon, UK) or anti-human IGF1 goat polyclonal (Oncogene Research Products, Fontenay sous Bois, France) neutralizing antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C in H358 CM. The immunoneutralized H358 CM was then added to H322 cells for 96 h. The morphological changes related to apoptosis were assessed by fluorescence microscopy after Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml) staining of cells (Sigma-Aldrich), and the percentage of apoptotic cells was scored after counting at least 200 cells. The proteolytic activation of pro-caspase-3 was evaluated by Western blotting: cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) for 30 min on ice. Protein content was assessed by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Ivry sur Seine, France). Cell lysates (40 μg of protein) were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Saint Quentin les Yvelines, France). After blocking nonspecific binding sites with 5% nonfat milk in TPBS (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary anti-human caspase-3 rabbit polyclonal antibody 1:1,000 (BD Pharmingen, Le Pont de Claix, France), diluted in TPBS. To ensure equal loading and transfer, membranes were also probed for actin using anti-actin rabbit polyclonal antibody 1:3000 (Sigma-Aldrich). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:10,000 in TPBS and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France). In some experiments, active caspase-3 was detected by flow cytometry using phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal active caspase-3 antibody kit (BD Pharmingen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Red fluorescence (phycoerythrin, FL-2) was detected at 575 nm. Cellular DNA was extracted by a salting-out procedure and detected after agarose gel electrophoresis. Cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/mlleupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin for H322 cells;50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate sodium, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin for H358 cells) for 30 min on ice. Immunoprecipitation of IGF1-R was performed using 1 μg of anti-IGF1-R β subunit rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tebu, Le Perray en Yvelines, France), overnight at 4 °C with continuous agitation. Immune complexes were collected using 80 μl of protein G-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) following continuous agitation for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for protein immunoblotting. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% BSA in TTBS (TBS, 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by 1:1000 dilution of anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Euromedex, Mundosheim, France). IGF1-R was detected by 1:1000 dilution of the anti-IGF1-R β subunit rabbit polyclonal antibody. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse 1:20,000 or anti-rabbit 1:10,000 antibodies in TTBS and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Conditioned media were obtained as previously described from serum-deprived H358 or H322 cells. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 106 cells/flask (75 cm2) or 8 × 105 cells/well (six wells plate). AR in the medium was analyzed using specific ELISA. Primary monoclonal anti-human AR antibody (2 μg/ml, R&D Systems) was coated to the bottom of 96-well plates and incubated overnight at room temperature. The wells were washed with TPBS (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), blocked by the addition of PBS containing 1% BSA and 5% sucrose for 1 h at room temperature and washed again. Solutions containing varying concentrations of biologically active recombinant amphiregulin or assay samples were diluted in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated 2 h at room temperature. The wells were washed prior to incubation with a mixture of the secondary biotinylated anti-human amphiregulin antibody (25 ng/ml, R&D Systems) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin 1:250 in buffer. Following incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the wells were incubated with substrate reagents A (catalog number 2606KC) and B (catalog number 2607KC) (1:1 ratio, BD Pharmingen) 30 min in the dark. Adding 1 mH2SO4 stopped the reaction, and optical density was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA plate reader. The IGF1 level in culture medium was analyzed by radioimmunoassay using the IGF1 extraction kit (Nichols Institute Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 96 h of culture in serum-free medium, H322 cells underwent apoptosis as revealed by morphological change (Fig.1 A). These changes coincided with DNA fragmentation visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 B) and proteolytic cleavage of pro-caspase-3 in its p12 active fragment (Fig. 1 C). Conversely, no evidence of cell death was detected in H358 cells, even after 120 h of serum deprivation (Fig. 1, A–C). To determine whether the resistance of H358 cells was due to the constitutive activation of a survival pathway or whether those cells secrete anti-apoptotic factors, serum-free conditioned medium from H358 cells (H358 CM) was collected and used for culturing H322 cells. H358 CM inhibited apoptosis of H322 cells, evaluated by the absence of morphological changes or cleavage of caspase-3, after 96 h of culture (Fig. 1 D). This effect was dose-dependent (data not shown). Human lung cancer cells are known to express EGFR, erbB-2/neu, IGF1-R, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs). We first considered the possible involvement of these receptors in the survival of H322 cells cultured in H358 CM. Serum-deprived H322 cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 10% serum, in serum-free medium or in H358 CM in the presence of several highly specific inhibitors (Fig.2). Tyrphostin AG825 and AG1295, which inhibited respectively the erbB-2/neu and the PDGFR, did not modify the survival of H322 cells cultured in the presence of serum, in serum-free medium, or in H358 CM (Fig. 2, A and B). The IGF1-R inhibitor tyrphostin AG1024 (1 μm) did not modify apoptosis in H322 cells cultured in the presence or in the absence of serum, but restored, in a dose-dependent manner, apoptosis when cells are cultured in H358 CM (Fig. 2 C). Both EGFR inhibitors tyrphostin AG556 (20 μm) and quinazolin ZD1839 (500 nm) did not modify apoptosis of the cells in the presence of serum, increased the level of apoptosis of the cells when cultured in serum-free medium, and restored apoptosis in H322 cells cultured in H358 CM (Fig. 2, D and E). We then analyzed the survival of H358 cells cultured in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of the same inhibitors (TableI). In the presence of serum none of the inhibitors induced apoptosis of H358 cells. In contrast, the EGFR inhibitor tyrphostin AG556 (10 μm) as well as the IGF1-R inhibitor tyrphostin AG1024 (10 μm) restored H358 cells apoptosis when cultured in serum-free medium (Table I). Conversely, concentration of up to 20 or 40 μm of the erbB-2/neu inhibitor tyrphostin AG825 and the PDGFR inhibitor tyrphostin AG1295 had no effect on H358 cell survival (Table I). These results were confirmed by a Western analysis of proteolytic activation of pro-caspase-3 in its p12 active fragment (Fig.3). Altogether, these data highly suggested that H358 cells secreted autocrine/paracrine factors activating the IGF1-R and EGFR in H358 and H322 cells.Table IEffect of tyrosine kinase receptors inhibition on serum deprivation apoptosis in H358 cellsReceptorInhibitorConcentrationApoptosis10% serum0% serumμmControl0.9 ± 0.11.9 ± 1.3EGFRAG 55624.1 ± 0.0102.2 ± 1.346.5 ± 14.0IGF1-RAG 1024511.2 ± 3.3101.7 ± 1.229.3 ± 0.2Erb-B2/neuAG 825104.0 ± 0.0202.3 ± 1.24.4 ± 0.6PDGFRAG 1295400.9 ± 0.84.7 ± 1.2The activity of tyrphostins AG556, AG1024, AG825, or AG1295 on apoptosis in H358 cells cultured in medium supplemented (10% serum) or not (0% serum) with serum was analyzed.

To identify factors of the EGF and IGF families involved in the anti-apoptotic activity of H358 CM, we used neutralizing antibodies. The anti-apoptotic activity of H358 CM was completely abolished by a preincubation with the anti-AR neutralizing antibody and to a lower extent (about 50%) by the anti-IGF1 antibody (TableII). In contrast, preincubation of H358 CM with anti-EGF, anti-TGFα, anti-betacellulin, anti-IGF2 antibodies, or with CRM197, which neutralized the HB-EGF, did not alter anti-apoptotic activity of H358 CM (Table II). These results were confirmed by treatment of H358 cells with an antisense oligonucleotide directed against the AR mRNA, which significantly restored apoptosis of H322 cells cultured in H358 CM (not shown).Table IIEffect of neutralization of the members of the EGF and IGF families on the anti-apoptotic activity of H358-conditioned mediumND502-aND50, neutralizing dose 50, given by the manufacturer; Ig, immunoglobulin; BTC, beta cellulin.Used concentrationsApoptosisμg/ml%/control0100CM7.1 ± 8.8CM + Ig3.4 ± 6.6CM + anti-EGF Ab0.04–0.08Up to 54.4 ± 6.2Anti-TGFα Ab0.2–0.4Up to 511.3 ± 10.8Anti-AR Ab5–151045.9 ± 8.615104.2 ± 16.7CRM197 (HB-EGF)101016.9 ± 15.02022.1 ± 19.7Anti-BTC Ab0.04–0.08Up to 517.3 ± 14.5Anti-IGF1 Ab2–5547.7 ± 10.01055.1 ± 19.3Anti-IGFII Ab5–15Up to 3012.2 ± 10.6H358-conditioned medium (CM) was preincubated with neutralizing antibodies, before being added to serum-deprived H322 cells for 96 h.

These lesions may be processed by either homologous recombination (HR) repair or translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). Vertebrate Polκ belongs to the DNA polymerase Y family, as do most TLS polymerases. However, the role for Polκ in vertebrate cells is unclear because of the lack of reverse genetic studies. Here, we generated cells deficient in Polκ (polκ cells) from the chicken B lymphocyte line DT40. Although purified Polκ is unable to bypass ultraviolet (UV) damage,polκ cells exhibited increased UV sensitivity, and the phenotype was suppressed by expression of human and chicken Polκ, suggesting that Polκ is involved in TLS of UV photoproduct. Defects in both Polκ and Rad18, which regulates TLS in yeast, in DT40 showed an additive effect on UV sensitivity. Interestingly, the level of sister chromatid exchange, which reflects HR-mediated repair, was elevated in normally cycling polκ cells. This implies functional redundancy between HR and Polκ in maintaining chromosomal DNA. In conclusion, vertebrate Polκ is involved in Rad18-independent TLS of UV damage and plays a role in maintaining genomic stability.

A wide range of potential insult to the genomic DNA is contributed not only by the environment, but also by cellular activities. DNA damages, which are left unrepaired by excision repair pathways, may arrest DNA replication, leading to breaks and gaps on the sister chromatids. These lesions are processed by two major postreplication repair pathways: homologous recombination (HR) 1The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous DNA recombination; TLS, translesion DNA synthesis; Pol, DNA polymerase; AAF, N-2-acetylaminofluorene; BaP, benzo[a]pyrene; IR, ionizing radiation; CDDP, cis-platinum (II) diaminodichloride (cisplatin); MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; SCE, sister chromatid exchange; 4-NQO, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HA, hemagglutinin; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. repair and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) (1Friedberg E.C.

TLS fills a daughter strand gap that encompasses a DNA damage on the template strand by employing a number of specialized DNA polymerases (Pols) (reviewed in Refs. 2Friedberg E.C. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5681-5683Google Scholar, 3Goodman M.F. Tippin B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 101-109Google Scholar, 4Hubscher U. Nasheuer H.P.

On the other hand, HR functions in processing both gaps and breaks by facilitating recombination between damaged sister chromatids with the other intact ones. Thus, daughter-strand gaps can be processed by both TLS and HR in postreplicational repair. Human cells contain four Y family DNA polymerases, namely Polη (Rad30A), Polι (Rad30B), Polκ (DinB1), and Rev1 (5Burgers P.M. Koonin E.V. Bruford E. Blanco L. Burtis K.C. Christman M.F. Copeland W.C.

Polη is mutated in a variant form of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP-V) (13Johnson R.E. Kondratick C.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 285: 263-265Google Scholar, 14Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A.

Human Polκ is a homolog of Escherichia coli DinB (pol IV) and a member of DNA polymerase Y family (15Gerlach V.L. Aravind L. Gotway G. Schultz R.A. Koonin E.V. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Induction of mutations by overexpression of Polκ in mammalian cells is in agreement with its role in TLS (16Ogi T. Kato Jr., T. Kato T. Ohmori H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 607-618Google Scholar). Likewise, purified human Polκ can bypass adducts of N-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and templates of 8-oxoguanine, abasic site and 1,N 6-ethenodeoxyadenosine. By contrast, Polκ is unable to bypass UV radiation-induced photoproducts or cisplatin adducts (8Levine R.L. Miller H. Grollman A. Ohashi E. Ohmori H. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Moriya M. J. Biol.

The Rad6 protein is one of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) and forms a tight complex with the Rad18 protein, which may have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (28Bailly V. Lamb J. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 811-820Google Scholar, 29Xin H. Lin W. Sumanasekera W. Zhang Y. Wu X. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2847-2854Google Scholar). Although all TLS is under Rad18 control, S. cerevisiae does not have a POLK gene. On the other hand,Schizosaccharimyces pombe does have a POLKortholog, but no data about genetic relationship between Polκ and Rad18 has been obtained. Similarly, it is not known whether Polκ is regulated by Rad18 in vertebrate cells. Here we present a phenotypic analysis of Polκ-deficient cells (hereafter abbreviated as polκ cells) derived from the chicken B lymphocyte line DT40 (30Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Google Scholar). Remarkably, polκcells showed elevated sensitivity to UV, although the data are not in agreement with previous biochemical studies. We also provide genetic data that Polκ and Rad18 show an additive effect on UV sensitivity, suggesting that Polκ is involved in Rad18-independent TLS of UV lesions. A chicken POLΚ (GdPOLΚ) partial cDNA was amplified from chicken testis cDNA by RT-PCR with the primer pair, 5′-CCATAGTGCACATTGACATGG-3′ and 5′-CACGAACACCAAATCTCCTTGC-3′, the design of which was based on the conserved polymerase motif in the human and mouse POLΚ genes. An amplified 144-bp fragment was subcloned into a pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced. A full-length Gd POLK cDNA was isolated by RACE reactions using the gene-specific primers, 5′-ACAACATACTCATTGATCCCACTGC-3′ for 5′-RACE and 5′-AATCCAGAGCTGAAGGAAAAGCC-3′ for 3′-RACE. The sequences of five independently isolated cDNA clones were determined. The chickenPOLK cDNA sequence has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under the accession numberAY118271. A 14-kb fragment containing part of the chicken genomic POLK locus was isolated from a DT40 genomic DNA library by hybridization with the 144-bp PCR-amplified fragment. The positions of exons and introns were determined by base sequencing. Chicken POLK disruption constructs containing drug resistance genes, POLK-HIS andPOLK-BSR were made by replacing 2-kb genomic sequences containing exons encoding amino acids 96–209 with histidinol-D and blasticidin-S selection marker cassettes. Since DT40 cells have a single POLK gene, the genotype of POLK-depleted cells is described as POLK/−. POLK-BSR was used for generating rad18 polκ(RAD18−/− POLK/−) cells from rad18 (RAD18−/−) cells containing the Histidinol-D- and Hygromycin-resistance genes (27Yamashita Y.M. Okada T. Matsusaka T. Sonoda E. Zhao G.Y. Araki K. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Takeda S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5558-5566Google Scholar). To construct an HA-tagged GdPOLK expression vector (designated as pcDB3), we amplified Gd POLΚ cDNAs including the sequence encoding human hemaggulutinin at the 3′-end by high-fidelity PCR with primers 5′-GGATCCATGGACAACGTGAAAAATGTTGAT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCATGCGTAGTCAGGGACGTCGTACGGATATTTAA-AAAACATTTCAATTGTACGCT-3′ and then inserted the PCR product into the BamHI site of pUHG10-3, an expression vector containing a tetracycline-repressible promoter (kindly provided from Dr. Bujard at ZMBH). To construct a human POLK expression vector (phPK-G), a full-lengthHs POLK cDNA (16Ogi T. Kato Jr., T. Kato T. Ohmori H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 607-618Google Scholar) was inserted into the EcoRI site of the multicloning sites of the expression vector, pCR3-loxP-multicloning sites/IRES-EGFP-loxP (designated as p176, in Ref.31Fujimori A.

The plasmids were linearized prior to transfection into DT40 cells; POLK-HIS, POLK-BSR, and pcDB3 were digested with XhoI, and p176 and phPK-G were digested withPvuI. The conditions for cell culture, selection, and DNA transfections have been described previously (32Bezzubova O. Silbergleit A. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. Buerstedde J.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 185-193Google Scholar, 33Buerstedde J.M. Reynaud C.A. Humphries E.H. Olson W. Ewert D.L. Weill J.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 921-927Google Scholar). Generation of RAD18−/− cells is described in our earlier report (27Yamashita Y.M. Okada T. Matsusaka T. Sonoda E. Zhao G.Y. Araki K. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Takeda S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5558-5566Google Scholar).XPA-deficient cells were made so as to delete amino acids sequences Asp125–Gln195. DT40 cells have only a single XPA gene, which is located on a sex chromosome. The strategy for XPA gene disruption is described in detail on our web site (www.rg.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index-e.html). Mutant DT40 cells described in this article, polκ(POLK/−), rad18(RAD18−/−), rad18 polκ(RAD18−/− POLK/−), andxpa polκ (XPA/−POLK/−) cells, and stable transfectants ofpolκ cells with the pcDB3, phPK-G, and p176 plasmids (designated as polκ +cPolκ, polκ +hPolκ, and polκ +GFP cells, respectively) are deposited at the RIKEN Cell Bank (RIKEN, Wako, Japan). Cell synchronization at the G1/S phase transition was achieved by sequential nocodazole and mimosine blocks as described previously (34Sonoda E. Matsusaka T. Morrison C. Vagnarelli P. Hoshi O. Ushiki T. Nojima K. Fukagawa T. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Earnshaw W.C. Takeda S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 759-770Google Scholar). To analyze the cell cycle, 1 × 106cells were exposed for 10 min to 20 μm5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and then harvested and fixed with 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were incubated with 2 m HCl containing Triton X-100 at 0.5%, treated with mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and subsequently with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing propidium iodide (PI) at 5 μg/ml for subsequent analysis with FACScaliber (BD Biosciences). To assess GFP expression, ∼1 × 106cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline for subsequent analysis with FACScaliber. Serially diluted cells were plated in triplicate onto 6-well plates with 5 ml/well of 1.5% (w/v) methylcellulose (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.), 15% fetal calf serum (Equitech-Bio, Ingram, TX), 1.5% chicken serum (Sigma), and 10 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, and were incubated at 39.5 °C for 6–7 days. To analyze sensitivities to IR (ionizing radiation; γ-ray), cells were plated into medium containing methylcellulose for a 1-h incubation at 39.5 °C, and subsequently irradiated with a 137Cs γ-ray source (GammaCell 40E; Nordion International, Kanata, Ontario, Canada). For exposure of cells to UV, 3 × 105 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum, introduced onto 6-well cluster plates and irradiated with UVC (wavelength, 254 nm), followed by addition of 1 ml of complete medium. For exposure of cells to cisplatin (CDDP,cis-platinum (II) diaminodichloride; Nihon-Kayaku, Tokyo, Japan), 1 × 105 cells were treated at 39.5 °C in 1 ml of complete medium containing CDDP for 1 h. Exposure of cells to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was performed in medium containing no serum for 1 h at 39.5 °C. Exposure of cells to AAF (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) or BaP (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was performed at 1 × 105cells/ml in a 5:1 mixture of serum-free medium and S-9 mix liver extract (Oriental Yeast Co, Tokyo, Japan) for 1 h at 39.5 °C. Measurement of chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) was carried out as previously described (35Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5166-5169Scopus (367) Google Scholar) with the following modification for cell preparation. To analyze UV-induced chromosomal aberrations, 1 × 106 asynchronous populations of cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum, spread onto 6-well plates, and exposed to 5 J/m2 UVC, followed by addition of 10 ml of complete medium. Cells were harvested at every 3 h for 12 h. The cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml of colcemid (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) for the final 3 h of the incubation to enrich for mitotic cells. To measure SCEs induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO; Nacalai-Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), cells were treated with 0.2 ng/ml of 4-NQO for the last 8 h of incubation with 10 μm BrdUrd for 18 h, which corresponds to two cell cycle periods of DT40 cells. The cells were also treated with 0.1 μg/ml of colcemid for the final 2 h of the incubation to enrich for mitotic cells. We isolated chicken POLK cDNA, which encodes a protein of 867 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 97 kDa (see Supplemental Data). The chicken Polκ protein shows ∼60% amino acid identity to the human and mouse Polκ overall. Amino acid sequence conservation is significant particularly within the five conserved motifs (37Kulaeva O.I. Koonin E.V. McDonald J.P. Randall S.K. Rabinovich N. Connaughton J.F. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 357: 245-253Google Scholar) of the DNA polymerase Y family, with 90% identity to those of human and mouse Polκ, and ∼60% to those ofE. coli DinB (38Ohmori H. Hatada E. Qiao Y. Tsuji M. Fukuda R. Mutat. Res. 1995; 347: 1-7Google Scholar). Additionally, residues Asp108, Asp199, and Glu200 in the polymerase motifs are perfectly conserved with strict intervals from bacterial DinB to the vertebrate Polκ proteins. FISH analysis indicated that the chicken POLK gene is located on the sex chromosome Z (data not shown). DT40 cells carry the ZW sex chromosome (35Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Google Scholar) and carry only a single POLK gene. Gene targeting constructs were generated to delete amino acids 96–209 including all the DNA polymerase motifs. Targeting events were verified by the appearance of a 3.7-kb band and the disappearance of an 8.5-kb band in Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA (Fig. 1, A and B). We isolated three POLK-disrupted cell clones (D12, D32, and D33), which proliferated with the same kinetics as did wild-type cells (Fig. 1, C and D). These mutant clones are designated polκ cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed a normal cell cycle distribution of an asynchronous population ofpolκ cells (Fig. 1D). To analyze the DNA repair capacity of polκcells, we examined viability of cells after various genotoxic treatments using colony survival assays. All three polκclones consistently showed a ∼1.8-fold increase in UV sensitivity as judged by the evaluation of the doses that reduce survival to 1% (Fig. 2A). The polκclones showed no significant increase in sensitivities to IR, cisplatin, or MMS in comparison to wild-type cells (Fig. 2,B–D). Moreover, we were unable to detect significant increases in sensitivities of polκ cells to AAF or BaP (Fig. 2, E and F). To confirm that the elevated UV sensitivity is caused by defective Polκ, the polκ cells were reconstituted with the chicken or human Polκ cDNA. We found that the reconstitution did restore the tolerance to UV to that of wild-type cells (Fig. 2A). We next examined UV sensitivity of polκ cells at each cell cycle phase, comparing with that of wild-type cells. To this end, the cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary using sequential nocodazole and mimosine blocks (34Sonoda E. Matsusaka T. Morrison C. Vagnarelli P. Hoshi O. Ushiki T. Nojima K. Fukagawa T. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Earnshaw W.C. Takeda S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 759-770Google Scholar). After the release from the G1/S block, cells were exposed to UV at a number of time points including early S phase (1.5 h after the release), late S phase (4.5 h after the release), and the G2/M phase (6 h after the release) (Fig. 3A). Wild-type cells showed increased resistance to UV as DNA replication progressed, reflecting lower frequencies of replication blockage caused by UV-induced damage at late S phase compared with early S phase. In contrast, only at early S phase, the UV sensitivity ofpolκ cells was significantly greater than that of wild-type cells. The early S phase-specific increase in UV sensitivity of polκ cells is in agreement with defective TLS in the mutant cells. UV-induced damage is expected to block DNA replication, leading to gaps and double-strand breaks (DSBs) in sister chromatids. To evaluate UV-induced DSBs, we measured cytologically detectable chromosomal aberrations following UV irradiation in asynchronous populations ofpolκ cells (Fig. 4). The cell cycle progression following UV irradiation is comparable between wild-type and polκ cells (data not shown). Cells irradiated at late S to G2 phase are expected to enter the M phase within 3 h following UV irradiation, whereas cells irradiated at G1 to early S phase may need 3–6 h to enter the M phase (39Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Google Scholar). We found no increase in the level of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations in polκ cells when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4), as expected from the normal growth property of polκ cells (Fig. 1, C and D). The levels of UV-induced chromosomal aberrations in polκ cells were up to 3-fold higher than those of wild-type cells in each 3-h period following UV irradiation (Fig. 4), indicating that the mutants are not able to deal with replication block as efficiently as are wild-type cells. It should be noted that in DT40 cells, UV irradiation induces both chromosome-type breaks, where a pair of sister chromatids are broken at the same site, and chromatid-type breaks, where only one sister chromatid is broken, although it is known that UV causes only chromatid-type breaks in other vertebrate cells (40Evans H.J. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1977; 8: 347-438Google Scholar). Thus, we may have to take into account DT40-specific mechanisms for the induction of chromosome-type breaks, such as efficient interactions between damaged chromatids and other intact ones through HR. There are three major pathways for repairing DNA damage induced by UV, i.e. the NER, HR, and TLS pathways (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, 1995: 523-576Google Scholar). It is not entirely clear which DNA polymerases are involved in the NER or HR pathways in vertebrate cells. To analyze the epistatic relationship of Polκ to the NER pathway, we generated cells deficient in the XPA protein (xpa cells) as well as cells deficient in both XPA and Polκ (xpa polκ cells). The XPA protein is involved in an early step of NER, and its defect causes hypersensitivity to UV and skin cancer. We found that both xpa and xpa polκ cells proliferated with normal kinetics (data not shown). Their UV sensitivity showed an additive effect of the mutations of XPA and Polκ on UV sensitivity (Fig. 2G), suggesting that Polκ does not function in the NER pathway. We also examined the involvement of Polκ in the HR pathway by assessing HR capability inpolκ cells. Analyses of gene-targeting efficiencies (TableI) and IR sensitivity (Fig. 2B) consistently showed that HR capability is not reduced inpolκ cells. Thus, defective HR does not account for increased UV sensitivity in polκ cells. In summary, the increased UV sensitivity of polκ cells is most likely to be explained by a defect in TLS, rather than a defect in NER or HR.Table ITarget integration frequencies of wild-type and mutant DT40 cellsGenotypeTargeted locusOVAIgLWild-type43 /47 (91.5%)19 /48 (39.6%)polκ30 /41 (73.2%)15 /48 (31.3%)rad540 /44 (0%)3 /48 (6.3%) Open table in a new tab We have shown that SCE, cytogenetically detectable crossover, reflects postreplication repair mediated by HR (36Sonoda E.

Katada T. Enomoto T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3428-3435Google Scholar). Interestingly, polκ cells exhibited a significant increase in the level of spontaneous SCEs (Fig. 5). This observation suggests that Polκ plays a role in maintaining chromosomal DNA during the cell cycle. To analyze SCE induced by genotoxic treatments, we exposed cells to 4-NQO, which is known to form DNA adducts similar to UV damage and to stimulate SCE (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, 1995: 523-576Google Scholar). The level of induced SCE events was also higher inpolκ cells when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 5). These observations support the notion that defective TLS inpolκ cells is compensated by HR, the other major postreplicational repair pathway. To examine the epistatic relationship between Polκ and Rad18, we generated cells deficient in both Rad18 and Polκ (rad18 polκ cells). We have previously shown thatrad18 cells are sensitive to various DNA damaging agents including IR, UV, and CDDP (27Yamashita Y.M. Okada T. Matsusaka T. Sonoda E. Zhao G.Y. Araki K. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Takeda S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5558-5566Google Scholar); consistent with the phenotype of the yeast rad18 mutant. Interestingly, defects in both Rad18 and Polκ have an additive effect on UV sensitivity (Fig. 2H), indicating that Polκ may work even in the absence of the Rad18 protein in vertebrate cells. Here we report the phenotypic analysis of polκ cells. Remarkably, the mutant cells showed elevated UV sensitivity. We postulate that the elevated UV sensitivity in polκ cells indeed reflects an important role for Polκ in processing UV damage from the following data. Colony survival assays showed that depletion of Polκ in wild-type and rad18 cells both increased their UV sensitivity (Fig. 2A). Likewise, polκ cells exhibited increased levels of UV-induced chromosomal aberrations when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4). The elevated UV sensitivity ofpolκ cells is not likely to be attributed to chicken-specific characteristics, because both the human and chickenPOLK gene normalized UV sensitivity of Polκ-deficient DT40 cells (Fig. 2A). The discrepancy between this in vivo data and no detectable activity of purified Polκ of copying UV damage could be explained as followings. First, experimental conditions used for the biochemical studies of Polκ are not optimal for evaluating the function of Polκin vivo. For example, unknown cofactors required for Polκ in the bypass of UV damage may have been absent from in vitro reactions. Second, Polκ may be involved in an extension step following nucleotide incorporation of a damaged template DNA, based on the two step-two polymerase hypothesis proposed by several groups (Refs. 11Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5259-5266Google Scholar, 42Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L.

A recent biochemical study shows that human Polκ is very efficient at extending from a G opposite the 3′-T of a T-T dimer (46Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This observation as well as our genetic study suggests that Polκ can play a significant role in TLS of UV lesions. polκ DT40 cells showed elevated UV sensitivity, but did not show elevated sensitivity to AAF or BaP, although Polκ can replicate a template strand containing these adducts in in vitro reactions (10Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. Yuan F. Xin H. Wu X. Rajpal D.K. Yang D. Wang Z.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6100-6106Google Scholar). Presumably, this is explained as follows: Several TLS polymerases have redundancy in bypassing a given DNA damage (47Chiapperino D. Kroth H. Kramarczuk I.H. Sayer J.M. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Jerina D.M. Cheh A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11765-11771Google Scholar), and the relative contribution of each TLS polymerase to processing a given type of DNA lesion may be distinctly different between each cell line and tissue. Thus, the involvement of Polκ in bypassing DNA damage caused by AAF and BaP should be analyzed using DT40 mutants deficient in both Polκ and another TLS polymerase. It is interesting that defects in Rad18 and Polκ showed an additive effect on UV sensitivity. The data suggest that Polκ participates in Rad18-independent TLS of UV lesions and that Rad18 does not necessarily regulate all TLS polymerases in vertebrate cells. Recent genetic studies of S. cerevisiae also suggested that the existence of Rad18-independent TLS of UV lesion (48Cejka P. Vondrejs V. Storchova Z. Genetics. 2001; 159: 953-963Google Scholar). A significant increase in the level of SCE was observed in polκ cells not only after 4-NQO treatment but also during the cell cycle. Likewise, the level of spontaneously arising SCE events is increased in cells from XP-V patients (49Cleaver J.E. Afzal V. Feeney L. McDowell M. Sadinski W. Volpe J.P. Busch D.B. Coleman D.M. Ziffer D.W. Yu Y. Nagasawa H. Little J.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1102-1108Google Scholar). We interpret these increased levels of SCE as more frequent usage of the HR pathway for postreplicational repair. Presumably, gaps that should be filled by Polκ may accumulate inpolκ cells and stimulate HR with the other sister chromatid, leading to an increase in SCE events. Importantly, increased levels of spontaneous SCE in polκ cells imply the functional cooperation between the Polκ-dependent TLS and HR pathways in the maintenance of chromosomal DNA. This conclusion leads to the notion that the relative usage of POLK in postreplication repair may determine mutation frequency in cycling cells, since Polκ-dependent TLS is highly mutagenic (16Ogi T. Kato Jr., T. Kato T. Ohmori H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 607-618Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that the expression of mammalian POLKis inducible by environmental mutagens, BaP and dioxin (50Ogi T. Mimura J. Hikida M. Fujimoto H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ohmori H.

It signals via its cognate receptor, a complex of IL-13 receptor α1 chain (IL-13Rα1) with IL-4Rα; however, a second protein, IL-13Rα2, also binds IL-13. To determine the binding contributions of the individual components of the IL-13 receptor to IL-13, we have employed surface plasmon resonance and equilibrium binding assays to investigate the ligand binding characteristics of shIL-13Rα1, shIL-13Rα2, and IL-4Rα. shIL-13Rα1 bound IL-13 with moderate affinity (K D= 37.8 ± 1.8 nm, n = 10), whereas no binding was observed for hIL-4Rα. In contrast, shIL-13Rα2 produced a high affinity interaction with IL-13 (K D = 2.49 ± 0.94 nm n = 10). IL-13Rα2 exhibited the binding characteristics of a negative regulator with a fast association rate and an exceptional slow dissociation rate. Although IL-13 interacted weakly with IL-4Rα on its own (K D > 50 μm), the presence of hIL-4Rα significantly increased the affinity of shIL-13Rα1 for IL-13 but had no effect on the binding affinity of IL-13Rα2. Detailed kinetic analyses of the binding properties of the heteromeric complexes suggested a sequential mechanism for the binding of IL-13 to its signaling receptor, in which IL-13 first binds to IL-13Rα1 and this then recruits IL-4Rα to stabilize a high affinity interaction.

It also down-regulates the production of tumor necrosis factor α, increases expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 on endothelial cells, and enhances the induction of major histocompatibility complex Class II and CD23 antigens on monocytes. IL-13 is a key cytokine in asthma not only because of its pro-allergic role but also its wide ranging effects on epithelial cells and fibroblasts linked to airway wall remodeling. Overexpression of IL-13 in the bronchial epithelium of transgenic mice causes lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration, goblet cell metaplasia, subepithelial fibrosis, and smooth muscle proliferation associated with marked bronchial hyper-responsiveness (3Chomarat P.

IL-13 mediates these functions through interacting with its cognate receptor on hematopoietic and other cell types, but no functional receptors have been identified on human or mouse T-cells (7Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The human IL-13 receptor (IL-13R) is a heterodimer composed of the interleukin-4 receptor α chain (IL-4Rα) and an IL-13 binding protein, IL-13Rα1 (10Miloux B. Laurent P. Bonnin O. Lupker J. Caput D. Vita N. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although they only share 25% homology, IL-13 shares many functional properties with IL-4 as a result of the common IL-4Rα component in their receptors. The IL-13Rα1·IL-4Rα complex can act as an alternative IL-4 receptor especially in cells that lack the common gamma chain (γc) that usually forms a heterodimer with IL-4Rα to bind IL-4. However, IL-13 appears to have a distinct role in allergic inflammation. It has been shown, in a mouse model, that IL-13 acts as a key regulator of allergen-induced airway inflammation and remodeling, which were independent of IL-4 (1Wills-Karp M. Luyimbazi J. Xu X.

Sheppard D. Mohrs M. Donaldson D.D. Locksley R.M. Corry D.B. Science. 1998; 282: 2261-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). In a cellular context, IL-13 binds to IL-13Rα1 with moderate affinity (K D = 2–10 nm) in the absence of IL-4Rα; however, this affinity increases when IL-4Rα is present (12Hilton D.J. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). IL-13 does not bind IL-4α in the absence of IL-13Rα1. A second IL-13 binding protein, IL-13Rα2, has also been identified. IL-13Rα2 shares a 37% homology with IL-13Rα1 and binds IL-13 with high affinity (50 pm) (10Miloux B. Laurent P. Bonnin O. Lupker J.

Despite this increased binding affinity, IL-13Rα2 is believed to be non-signaling and therefore may act as a “decoy” receptor. The presence of IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα on the cell surface renders cells responsive to IL-13; thus IL-13Rα2 is not required for receptor-ligand interactions. Similarly, the expression of IL-13Rα2 in vitro does not make cells responsive to IL-13. The discovery of a soluble receptor, homologous to IL-13Rα2, in the serum and urine of mice has lent support to this regulatory role (15Zhang J.G. Hilton D.J. Willson T.A. McFarlane C.

However, this soluble protein has yet to be identified in humans. After binding to its receptor, both IL-4 and IL-13 signal through phosphorylation-dependent activation of Jak kinases and the transcription factor, STAT6 (17Murata T. Taguchi J. Puri R.K. Blood. 1998; 91: 3884-3891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IL-13Rα1·IL-4α complex is thought to initiate its signal via IL-4Rα chain, because binding to the complex by either IL-13 or IL-4 results in the phosphorylation of IL-4Rα, insulin-receptor substrate-2, JAK1, and Tyk2, which is characteristic of the IL-4 response (18Wills-Karp M. J Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 9-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 19Welham M.J. Learmouth L. Bone H. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12286-12296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). IL-13Rα2 is unable to initiate the downstream signaling pathway because it lacks box-1 and -2 signaling motifs in its cytoplasmic domain, but it does contain a putative consensus phosphorylation site that may interact with Src homology 2-containing proteins. Recently it has been shown that IL-13Rα2 may play an important role in receptor internalization (20Kawakami K. Taguchi J. Murata T. Puri R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 2673-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,21Kawakami K. Takeshita F. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25114-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unlike the closely related IL-4 receptor, the receptors for IL-13 have not been characterized in detail. The composition and binding affinities of IL-13R have been investigated in various cell types by cross-linking and displacement of radiolabeled IL-13 and/or IL-4. However, the contribution by individual subunits to the overall affinity of the different types of IL-13 receptor complexes is still unclear. In our studies of the IL-13 receptor system, we have used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and equilibrium binding assays to analyze the binding properties of soluble forms of IL-13R subunits comprising the extracellular ligand binding domain either alone or as complexes with each other. We present the first kinetic analysis of IL-13 receptor binding using a biosensor and confirm previous values reported from equilibrium binding studies. By using several different experimental strategies to direct the assembly of receptor complexes, we have also been able to isolate and analyze homomeric and heteromeric complexes of the IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 subunits. From these experiments we were able to observe a sequential mechanism for the binding of IL-13 to its receptor in which IL-13 first binds to IL-13Rα1, and then this complex recruits IL-4Rα to create a high affinity interaction. This study describes the first detailed analysis of the interaction of IL-13 with its binding chains and, given the importance of IL-13 in allergic inflammation, may provide insight into the modulation of IL-13 responses. Sensor chips (SA and CM5), HBS buffer (10 nm Hepes with 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mmEDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20), amine coupling kit, and regeneration agents were supplied by BIAcore, unless otherwise stated. Protein A and human IgG were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant shIL-13Rα1.Fc, shIL-13α2.Fc, and biotinylated IL-13 were gifts from the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). shIL-4Rα.Fc chimera and biotinylated IL-4 were obtained from R&D Systems. Recombinant IL-13 and IL-4 were purchased from Peprotech. The bindability of the receptor and ligand preparations was determined by serial incubation with corresponding ligand or receptor (100 ng/ml IL-13, IL-4, shIL-13Rα2.Fc, or shIL-4Rα, as appropriate) immobilized in the wells of a Maxisorb enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate until the unbound receptor (or ligand) reached a constant value, enabling computation of the bindable fraction. This was 80% for biotinylated IL-13, 97% for IL-13Rα2.Fc, 99% for IL-13Rα1, and 88% for IL-4Rα. Analyte concentrations were corrected for bindability. The molecular interactions between shIL-13Rα1.Fc, shIL-13Rα2.Fc, and IL-13 were determined by surface plasmon resonance measurements using a BIAcore 2000TMbiosensor (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described in detail elsewhere (22Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 23Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated IL-13 was diluted in HBS running buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20) and immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (SA chip) that had been conditioned with (3×) 1-min injections of 1 m NaCl in 50 mm NaOH. All receptor proteins were diluted from stock to the desired concentration in HBS buffer. To determine kinetic constants, sensograms were collected at 25 °C, flow rate 10 μl/min, and data collection rate of 1 Hz. For binding and kinetic analysis, five serial dilutions (200–1000 nm) of each protein were injected separately over the IL-13 surface. 200 nm IL-13 was present in HBS buffer during the dissociation phase to minimize rebinding to the sensor chip surface. Sensograms were recorded and normalized to a base line of 0 resonance units (RU). Equivalent concentrations of each protein were injected over an untreated surface to serve as blank sensograms for subtraction of bulk refractive index background. The sensor chip surface was regenerated between runs with a 1-min injection of 10 mmHCl, at 10 μl/min. The resultant sensograms were then evaluated using the BIA evaluation 2.0 software to provide kinetic data. Briefly, the association of an analyte to the immobilized ligand is described by dR/dt =k on CR max − (k on C +k off)R tn, wherek on is the association rate constant,C is the concentration of the analyte,R max is the maximum binding capacity of the ligand, k off is the dissociation rate constant, and R tn is the amount of analyte bound to the ligand at time tn. A plot ofdR/dt versus R tngives a line with slope k s = −(k on C +k off). A plot of k s versus C for various concentrations of analyte results in a slope of the fitted line, which is equal tok on. The dissociation rate constant, k off, is determined by the first rate order equationdR/dt =k off R tn, measured when analyte passing over the ligand is replaced with buffer and under the conditions where R approaches R max to minimize the effect of rebinding. k off is obtained from the slope of the plot, ln(R t1 − R tn)versus t, during the initial phase of dissociation (first 60 s) where R t1is the amount of bound analyte at time t 1,R tn is the amount of bound analyte at timet n, and t is t n −t 1. The equilibrium dissociation constant isK D =k off/k on. A CM5 sensor chip was activated with a 10-μl injection ofN-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-[(3-diethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide) followed by an injection of 10-μl Protein A in 10 mmsodium acetate (pH 4.0). The remaining activated esters were blocked by an injection of 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine. shIL-13Rα1, shIL-13Rα2, or shIL-4Rα were injected either singly or in combination and allowed to bind non-covalently to the immobilized Protein A. This allows the preparation of homogeneous surfaces at controlled densities of either shIL-13Rα1, shIL-13Rα2, or IL-4Rα as well as mixed co-receptor surfaces at varying ratios of each subunit. A series of concentrations (50–200 nm) of IL-13 or IL-4 in HBS buffer were passed over the sensor chip surface, and the resulting sensograms were recorded and analyzed as previously described. Recombinant receptors (0.13–81 μg/ml) were immobilized on Protein A (100 μg/well) coupled to Maxisorb enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Nalgene Nunc, Herefordshire UK); unoccupied sites were blocked with the addition of human IgG (50 μg/ml). The receptors were then allowed to bind to serial dilutions of biotinylated IL-13 or IL-4 overnight at 4 °C; nonspecific binding at each ligand concentration was determined by the addition of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled IL-13 or IL-4. Bound ligand was detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate using tetramethylbenzidine as chromagen. The absorbance was read on microplate spectrophotometer at 450 nm with a 630-nm reference filter, and the amount of bound ligand was determined by reference to a standard curve generated using serial dilutions of biotinylated IL-13 or IL-4. After determination of free and bound ligand and correction for nonspecific binding, equilibrium binding constants were determined by Scatchard analysis. The binding kinetics of IL-13 to shIL-13Rα1 and shIL-13Rα2 were analyzed in real-time by SPR using a BIAcoreTM 2000 biosensor and biotinylated IL-13 immobilized on an SA sensor chip. This was found to be the most efficient use of reagents because the IL-13 surface could be regenerated with 10 mm HCl more than 50 times and still retained over 95% of its binding capacity. Fig.1 shows an overlay of a series sensograms obtained after the interaction of various concentrations of shIL-13Rα1 with IL-13 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis of the rate of binding versusconcentration of bound shIL-13Rα1 at various time points enabled the derivation of both the association and dissociation rate constants (3.76 ± 2.6 × 104m−1s−1 and 1.41 ± 0.13 × 10−3 s−1, respectively). The calculated dissociation constant (K D =k off /k on) was found to be 37.8 ± 1.8 nm. Similar experiments were also carried for shIL-13Rα2, the results of which are shown in Fig. 1. In this case the association and dissociation rate constants were found to be 5.41 ± 1.42 × 104m−1s−1 and 1.39 ± 0.15 × 10−4 s−1, and this gave aK D value of 2.49 ± 0.94 nm. shIL-4Rα was also injected over the IL-13-coated chip, but no binding interactions were observed. Fig. 2illustrates the specificity of the interaction; i.e.incubation of the receptor solution with increasing concentrations of IL-13 reduced the interaction of both soluble receptors with the IL-13 sensor chip surface in a dose-dependent manner. Preincubation with 500 nm IL-4 had no effect on the binding of either receptor chain (data not shown).Figure 2Specificity of ligand binding to the IL-13 surface. Sensograms of shIL-13Rα1 (A) and shIL-13Rα2 (B), which have been preincubated with IL-13 (lower to upper curve: 300, 200, 100, and 500 nm IL-4 acted as a negative control) prior to injection. The amount of receptor (expressed in RUs) binding to biotinylated IL-13 on the sensor chip decreased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing amounts of IL-13. The presence of 500 nmIL-4 had no effect on the amount of binding of either IL-13Rα1 or IL-13Rα2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To provide confirmation of the data obtained in the kinetic analyses, equilibrium binding studies were also carried out. In the case of IL-13Rα1, it was difficult to obtain a reliableK D, consistent with its low affinity as determined using SPR. In contrast, IL-13Rα2 bound to biotinylated IL-13 with an affinity similar to that determined by SPR (K D = 0.76 ± 0.09 nm) (Fig.3). Little or no interaction between IL-13 and IL-4Rα was detected in either SPR or equilibrium assays (data not shown). We then used the SPR protocol to determine if the presence of a particular subunit or ligand influenced binding affinity. 250 nm shIL-13Rα1 was preincubated with equimolar solutions of IL-13 or IL-4 in the presence or absence of IL-4Rα. Fig. 4 is a summary of results from sets of sensograms obtained for each experimental condition. The binding of shIL-13Rα1 to the sensor surface was unaffected by the presence of IL-4 with or without IL-4Rα. The binding of shIL-13Rα1 was reduced in the presence of IL-13 with or without IL-4Rα. However, in the presence of IL-4Rα, the dissociation rate was reduced when compared with shIL-13Rα1 on its own, leading to an overall increase in affinity. When these experiments were repeated using shIL-13Rα2 (Fig. 4), the presence of IL-13 reduced the amount of receptor binding to the sensor chip surface, but preincubation with IL-4Rα had no effect on either the amount of receptor bound or the affinity constants. The complex of IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα is known to bind IL-13 with high affinity. To characterize the kinetic and binding properties of this complex, sensor chip surfaces were prepared using both shIL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα bound to protein A. In this way we were able to prepare homogeneous surfaces at controlled densities of either IL-13Rα1 or IL-4Rα, as well as mixed co-receptor surfaces with varying ratios of each subunit. The binding kinetics of individual receptor subunits were initially evaluated and compared with the results obtained from the IL-13-immobilized chip (Table I). Fitting the data to a single-site model provided constants for shIL-13Rα1 and shIL-4Rα that were consistent with those previously determined for the biotinylated IL-13 surface (Table I), indicating that immobilization of either the ligand or the receptor on the chip surface was equivalent.Table IComparison of dissociation constants under different experimental conditionsK DshIL-13Rα1shIL-13Rα2hIL-4RαnmIL-13 surface37.8 ± 1.82.49 ± 0.94NDaND, no specific binding detected.Receptor surface34.2 ± 6.92.01 ± 0.70NDbBinding of IL-4 to a surface of immobilized IL-4Rα was found to be 545 ± 121 pm.

Receptor surface indicates were shIL-13Rα1, shIL-13Rα2, or hIL-4Rα were immobilized to the sensor surface via Protein A and IL-13 injections. We then carried out more critical studies focusing on the functional IL-13Rα1·IL-4Rα high affinity site. The surface was coated with either 1200 RU of shIL-13Rα1 and 600 RU of IL-4Rα (high IL-13Rα1) or 600 RU of shIL-13Rα1 and 1200 RU of IL-4Rα (low IL-13Rα1). The resultant sensograms obtained after injecting a series of concentrations of IL-13 were evaluated using a two-site model (TableII). Where IL-13Rα1 was in excess, two interactions were apparent: one of high affinity (K Dof 495 ± 125 pm) and a second of lower affinity (K D of 38 ± 3.2 nm). Because the affinity of the second interaction was comparable with that determined for IL-13Rα1 alone, it most likely represented the interaction of IL-13 with excess IL-13Rα1 subunits that have not formed part of the high affinity site. Thus, the high affinity interaction most likely represented binding of IL-13 to IL-13Rα1·IL-4Rα. Where IL-13Rα1 was limiting, two interactions were also observed: a high affinity site (K D = 492 ± 158 pm) identical to that observed with high IL-13Rα1 and a very low affinity site (K D > 400 nm). Because the latter site is most likely due to nonspecific binding of IL-13 to IL-4Rα and/or the sensor chip surface, we conclude that the high affinity site is best explained by binding of IL-13 to heterodimeric complexes of IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα; the mechanism of IL-13 binding to this high affinity site was then investigated using the kinetic data obtained from a series of injections of IL-13 over a mixed receptor surface. Thek a value obtained for these experiments was similar to that obtained for the binding of IL-13 to IL-13Rα1. However, the dissociation phase was remarkably slower thus indicating a stabilization of the complex and a sequential mechanism of binding. The ability of IL-4Rα to stabilize the binding of IL-13 to IL-13Rα1 was also observed in equilibrium binding studies. Thus, although we were unable to obtain any binding data for Scatchard analysis using IL-13Rα1 on its own, in the presence of IL-4Rα a dissociation constant of ∼10 nm was determined (data not shown).Table IIKinetic rate constants for the shIL-13Rα1·hIL-4Rα co-surface: the high affinity siteReceptoraReceptor indicates where shIL-13Rα1 or hIL-4Rα were immobilized singly or in combination to the sensor chip surface via Protein A.

Open table in a new tab We also used the BIAcore experimental protocol to investigate the possibility of a similar mechanism when IL-4 binds to an IL-4 receptor complex consisting of IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1. Sensor chip surfaces were prepared with high and low concentrations of IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1. Under both conditions, fitting of binding data either to a one- or two-site model indicated no high affinity sites greater than that observed for IL-4Rα. Thus, the presence of IL-13Rα1 had no detectable effect on the binding of IL-4 to IL-4Rα (data not shown). We have used SPR to determine the binding kinetics of the two IL-13 binding proteins, IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2. This represents the first detailed biosensor analysis of this receptor-ligand interaction. Our results confirmed those obtained in a more complex cell-based assay by showing that IL-13Rα2 has a higher affinity for IL-13 than IL-13Rα1. The data obtained by SPR were similar, but not identical, to previous values obtained from equilibrium binding assays in that the measured affinities were less than those previously reported. The results may reflect real differences inherent to the SPR biosensor method or simply errors in determinations, because the kinetic rates are approaching the limitations of the respective experimental procedures. The difference is unlikely to be due to biotinylation of IL-13, because similar results were obtained when IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 were immobilized on the sensor chip surface and IL-13 was injected. However, our findings with the IL-13R extracellular domains are not unprecedented: similar results have been observed for the epidermal growth factor receptor where the binding affinities of the extracellular domain, determined either by SPR (24Zhou M. Felder S. Rubinstein M. Hurwitz D.R. Ullrich A. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8193-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or titration calorimetry (25Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), yield binding constants that are less than those obtained in binding assays with cells or membranes. This appears to be due, in part, to the use of the extracellular domain of the receptor and the consequent loss of stabilizing interactions derived from the transmembrane and intracellular domains. Kawakami et al.(20Kawakami K. Taguchi J. Murata T. Puri R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 2673-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 21Kawakami K. Takeshita F. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25114-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have suggested that the transmembrane domain of IL-13 receptors are required to stabilize the binding of IL-13, this is the most likely explanation for the differences observed in the biosensor measurements. Although this identifies a potential limitation of use of isolated extracellular domains, the value of this SPR method is that it enables ligand-receptor interactions to be measure in real-time without the confounding influence of other protein-protein interactions. This property is highlighted by our attempts to estimate the binding affinity of shIL-13Rα1 using conventional equilibrium binding studies. Due to its comparatively low affinity, we were unable to detect significant binding at equilibrium. From the kinetic data derived from the SPR measurements, it is most likely that this is due to the high off-rate of IL-13Rα1, causing substantial loss of ligand during the wash procedures that are required for measurement of bound ligand. The advantage of SPR is that we can monitor these interactions in real-time, thus giving an opportunity to evaluate low binding affinities that are not amenable to more conventional methods. Using SPR we were able to dissect the binding contributions of individual IL-13 receptor chains and the influence of IL-4Rα on these. In the initial assays where IL-13 was immobilized on the sensor surface, only the presence of IL-13 appeared to affect the binding of shIL-13Rα1or shIL-13Rα2 to the surface. However, we noted that, when IL-4Rα was co-injected with shIL-13Rα1, there appeared to be a decrease in the rate of dissociation compared with that obtained for shIL-13Rα1 on its own. This therefore represented a higher affinity interaction and was a closer approximation to the binding constants observed in intact cells. This observation led us to develop experimental protocols to try to examine this high affinity site further. To determine the kinetics of binding of IL-13 to this heterocomplex we prepared surfaces comprising a combination of shIL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα. Because these surfaces contained more than a single class of binding sites, we prepared relatively low density surfaces to analyze the high affinity site while minimizing any mass diffusion effects during the association phase. When concentrations of IL-13 were applied to the surface, a two-site model gaveK D values of 495 ± 125 pm and 34.2 ± 6.9 nm, indicating the presence of a high affinity site. Having established the presence of a high affinity site on the sensor surface, we turned our attention to the mechanism of binding. There are three possible outcomes to the binding of IL-13 to the mixed receptor surface made up of IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα; first, that IL-13 will bind to IL-13Rα1 and lL-4Rα independently, second, that IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα pre-associate to form a high affinity site, or third, that a sequential binding mechanism occurs so that lL-13 first binds to IL-13Rα1, which then recruits IL-4Rα to form a high affinity complex. Because we had demonstrated that the high affinity site existed, we eliminated the first possibility. By analyzing the kinetic data, we determined whether the high affinity site was pre-associated or sequential. Binding to a pre-associated site would result in association and dissociation constants that were different from the individual subunits, whereas for a sequential interaction the association constant would be unchanged but the dissociation rate constant value would change. The results of the data analysis yielded the best fit to a model in which IL-13 bound to IL-13Rα1 and then recruited IL-4Rα to stabilize the interaction and give a high affinity complex. The association rate constant was essentially the same as that observed for IL-13Rα1 alone, whereas the dissociation constant was 2-fold slower yielding an equilibrium constant of 495 ± 125 pm. This experimental procedure was repeated using IL-4 in an attempt to see if a similar mechanism existed within this complex. No increase in affinity or any evidence of a high affinity site was observed throughout these experiments. Although this was slightly surprising, due to the similarity in protein structure and common receptor subunit, it may be that the contribution of IL-13Rα1 to the IL-4 receptor complex is so small that it is not detectable using this experimental approach. A sequential mechanism has been proposed for binding of IL-4 to an alternative IL-4R made of IL-4Rα and the common γc chain (26Russell S.M. Keegan A.D. Harada N. Nakamura Y. Noguchi M. Leland P. Friedmann M.C. Miyajima A. Puri R.K. Paul W.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1880-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). First, IL-4 binds to IL-4Rα and then recruits γc to form a signaling heterodimer. The results from our binding studies have shown that a similar mechanism may be apparent with the interaction of IL-13 with its receptor. Following the sequential mechanism suggested for IL-4, IL-13 would appear to bind first to IL-13Rα1. The resulting complex then recruits IL-4Rα to form a signaling heterodimer. Binding to IL-13Rα1 may induce a conformational change that presumably then allows it to bind to IL-4Rα. It may be this rearrangement that is responsible for the overall increase in affinity of the IL-13·IL-13Rα1·IL-4Rα complex. This would then account for the observed decrease in the dissociation rate in our combined experiments. Analysis of the kinetic data shows that shIL-13Rα1 binds to IL-13 and disassociates rapidly. However, shIL-13Rα2 owes much of its high affinity to a very slow dissociation rate. It has been suggested that IL-13Rα2 may act as a decoy receptor regulating the action of IL-13. The kinetic data may give some support to this model, because a high on-rate and very slow dissociation rate are characteristic of a negative regulator. We have employed SPR to determine the kinetic binding constants for the simple shIL-13Rα1, shIL-13Rα2, and IL-4Rα receptor subunits. In addition, we were able to analyze a complex system in which two subunits were present on the same surface and establish that these proteins bind IL-13 in a sequential manner to give a high affinity complex. This model mimics the high affinity IL-13 receptor found on the cell surface, providing a useful system for the screening and analysis of novel antagonistic molecules that may have therapeutic potential. We are grateful to Dr. Sandy Goldman of the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA) for generously providing shIL-13Rα1.Fc and shIL-13Rα2.Fc for these studies and to Phil Buckle (BIAcore) for his advice and assistance."

Full-Text PDF Open Access The mammalian cell cycle is temporally controlled by the synthesis and degradation of cell cycle-specific proteins, such as cyclins, and by the activation or inactivation of members of a conserved family of serine/threonine protein kinases known as the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; Cpd5, compound 5, 2-(2-mercaptoethanol)-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MS, mass spectrometry; LC-ESI, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; NSC 663284, 7-chloro-6-(2-morpholin-4-ylethylamino)-quinoline-5,8-dione; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography (1Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E73-E79Google Scholar). The activity of Cdks is regulated on four levels. First, Cdk activation requires binding to a cyclin partner. Second, the activity of Cdk/cyclin complexes is negatively regulated by several families of specific Cdk/cyclin inhibitors (the Kip/Cip proteins including p21, p27, and p57, and the Ink4 proteins including p15, p16, p18, and p19) (2Vidal A. Koff A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 1-15Google Scholar). Third, Cdks must be phosphorylated on a threonine residue (Thr160 on Cdk2, Thr161 on Cdk1) located in the “T-loop” to fully open its catalytic cleft (3Endicott J.A. Noble M.E.M. Tucker J.A. Curr.

Finally, the Cdk/cyclin complex is kept inactive by phosphorylation on Tyr15, or sometimes Thr14 and Tyr15residues in the ATP-binding site of Cdk. The conserved Tyr15 is phosphorylated by Wee1/Mik1 or Myt1 (6Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Google Scholar, 7Booher R.N. Holman P.S. Fattaey A. J. Biol.

Cdc25 dual specificity phosphatases play key roles in cell proliferation by removing the inhibitory phosphates from the ATP-binding site Tyr15 and/or Thr14 of the Cdk, thus activating cell cycle-specific Cdk/cyclin complexes (1Pines J.

Three Cdc25 genes have been found in humans: those for Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Google Scholar). Moreover, Cdc25A is a transcriptional target of oncogenes c-myc andE2F and has oncogenic properties (13Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G.

Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Google Scholar). In rodent cells, human Cdc25A cooperates with either Ha-RASG12V or loss of RB1 in oncogenic focus formation. Such transformants are highly aneuploid, grow in soft agar, and form high grade tumors in nude mice (17Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Cdc25A has been found in a number of human cancers (18Dixon D. Moyana T. King M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 236-243Google Scholar, 19Gasparotto D. Maestro R. Piccinin S. Vukosavljevic T. Barzan L. Sulfaro S. Boiocchi M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2366-2368Google Scholar). Therefore, Cdc25A is an attractive molecular target for rational antiproliferative drug design. Recently, we identified the most potent in vitro inhibitor of Cdc25A reported to date: 7-chloro-6-(2-morpholin-4-ylethylamino)-quinoline-5,8-dione (NSC 663284), using an artificial substrate O-methyl fluoroscein monophosphate (20Lazo J.S. Aslan D.C. Southwick E.C. Cooley K.A. Ducruet A.P. Joo B. Vogt A. Wipf P. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 4042-4049Google Scholar). Moreover, using this same substrate, we found NSC 663284 was 20- and 450-fold more selective against the Cdc25 phosphatase family compared with VHR or PTP1B, and exhibited mixed inhibition kinetics against Cdc25A, Cdc25B2, and Cdc25C with K i values of 29, 95, and 89 nm, respectively. Although NSC 663284 had marked antiproliferative activity against human MCF-7 breast cancer cells (20Lazo J.S. Aslan D.C. Southwick E.C. Cooley K.A. Ducruet A.P. Joo B. Vogt A. Wipf P. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 4042-4049Google Scholar), its effects on cell cycle progression, Cdc25-mediated dephosphorylation of Cdk/cyclin biological substrates, and the specific binding sites on Cdc25A have not been examined. Thus, the present study was initiated to delineate the cellular and molecular antiproliferative mechanisms of NSC 663284. We now demonstrated that NSC 663284 arrested cells at both the G1 and G2/M phase and inhibited the dephosphorylation and activation of Cdks in vitro andin vivo. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and capillary liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (capillary LC-ESI MS) analysis, we further observed the products of NSC 663284 bound to the recombinant human Cdc25A catalytic domain. Propidium iodide and RNase A (Cellular DNA Flow Cytometric Analysis Reagent Set) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The anti-Cdk1(sc-54 and sc-54-AC), anti-Cdk2 (sc-163 and sc-163-AC), anti-Cdk4 (sc-749 and sc-260-AC), anti-cyclin D1 (sc-486), anti-cyclin E (sc-481), anti-cyclin B1 (sc-245), anti-Cdc25B (sc-5619), anti-Cdc25C (sc-327), and transforming growth factor-β1/2/3 (sc-7892) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Wee1 kinase and Cdk2/cyclin A complex were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-c-Myc antibody (OP10) and histone 1 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). [γ-33P]ATP (10 mCi/ml) was from Amersham Biosciences. pET-21a(+) vector and bacteria strain BL21(DE3) were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). Cloned Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Restriction enzymes and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Acetic acid, HPLC grade water, and acetonitrile were purchased from Fisher. Sinnapinic acid and apomyoglobin were from Sigma. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). tsFT210 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 32.0 °C and plated at a density as described previously (21Tamura K. Southwick E.C. Kerns J. Rosi K. Carr B.I. Wilcox C. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1317-1325Google Scholar). The tsFT210 cells have two point mutations in the Cdk1 gene, which changes an isoleucine to a valine in the PSTAIR region, and a proline to a serine at the COOH terminus (22Th'ng J.P.H. Wright P.S. Hamaguchi J. Lee M.G. Norbury C.J. Nurse P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 313-324Google Scholar). Because of these mutations, Cdk1 becomes inactivated and degrades in tsFT210 cells at the restrictive temperature of 39.4 °C, and cell cycle progression arrests at the mid to late G2phase. Therefore, tsFT210 cells are easily manipulated for cell cycle studies without the use of chemicals. Cell cycle progression was arrested at G2 phase by incubation at 39.4 °C for 17 h. For G2 arrest studies, the G2 phase synchronized cells were then treated with various concentrations of NSC 663284 (0.1–30 μm), nocodazole (1 μm), or Cpd 5 (20 μm) and reincubated at 32.0 °C for 6 h. For G1 arrest studies, the G2 phase synchronized cells were reincubated immediately at 32.0 °C for 6 h. Cells were then treated with various concentrations of NSC 663284 (0.1–30 μm), Cpd 5 (15 μm), or roscovitine (50 μm), and incubated at 32.0 °C for another 6 h. The treated cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline at 5 × 105cells/ml. The fixed cells were centrifuged and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 250 μg/ml RNase A at 37.0 °C for 30 min, and then stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out using a FACStar (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Data were analyzed using program WINDMI version 2.7. tsFT210 cells arrested at G1 or G2/M phase by NSC 663284, as described above, were harvested and lysed in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.25 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-Cdk2 or anti-Cdk4 or anti-Cdk1 agarose conjugate as recommended by the manufacturer. The respective Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk1 immunoprecipitate kinase assays were carried out in a kinase buffer of 16.5 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, 1 mg/ml BSA, 25 μm cold ATP, 16.5 mm NaF, 1.65 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.33 mmNa3VO4, 3 μg of histone 1, and 10 μCi [γ-33P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reactions were stopped by adding 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were resolved on 12% Tris-glycine gel. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Bar charts were plotted using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Whole cell lysates were mixed with equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, fractionated on a 12.5% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel (7 cm × 11 cm), and analyzed by Western blotting for Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk1, cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin B1, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C. The catalytic domain of human Cdc25A (residues 336–523) was cloned into pET-21a(+) vector atBamHI and XhoI sites with a His6 tag at the COOH terminus, and expressed in BL21(DE3). Protein was affinity-purified to homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) followed by dialysis using 10-kDa cut-off dialysis tubing (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The phosphatase activity of recombinant human Cdc25A catalytic domain was assayed usingO-methyl fluorescein monophosphate as a substrate (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Fluorescence emission from the product was measured over a 10–60-min reaction period at room temperature with a multiwell plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems Cytofluor II; excitation filter, 485/20 nm; emission filter, 530/30 nm). Wee1 kinase assay was carried out in the kinase buffer of 50 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, pH 7.5, containing 20 units of Cdk2/cyclin A, 6 units of Wee1, 1 mg/ml BSA, 25 μm cold ATP, and incubated at 30 °C for 25 min with agitation. The effect of NSC 663284 on Cdc25A phosphatase activity was determined by incubating 60 μm (final concentration) affinity purified recombinant human Cdc25A catalytic domain with compound to protein molar ratios of 0.1:1, 1:1, 10:1, 30:1, and 100:1 at 30 °C for 30 min with agitation. A Me2SO vehicle control was also included. The activity of the phosphatase was stopped by adding a final concentration of 16.5 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 16.5 mm NaF, 1.65 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 0.33 mmNa3VO4. The Cdk2/cyclin A kinase activity was assayed by adding in 3 μg of histone 1, and 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were resolved on 12% Tris-glycine gel. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. The Cdk2/cyclin A kinase assay was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% Brij 35, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 25 mm NaF, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 25 μm cold ATP, 20 units of Cdk2/cyclin A, 3 μg of histone 1, 60 μm NSC 663284, and 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP. Proteins were resolved on 12% Tris-glycine gel. Gels were dried and exposed to film. The phosphorylated histone 1 bands were analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics personal SI densitometer and quantified using the ImageQuant software package (version 4.1; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). NSC 663284 was dissolved in Me2SO and at various compound to protein molar ratios (0:1, 1:1, 10:1, 30:1, 200:1) was incubated with 60 μm (final concentration) recombinant human Cdc25A catalytic domain for 1 h at room temperature. An equal volume of Me2SO without NSC 663284 was used as vehicle control. The reaction mixtures were desalted with C18 Ziptips (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which also removed non-covalently bound NSC 663284. The reaction products were eluted with 5 μl of acetic acid:acetonitrile:H2O (0.1:49.95:49.95, v/v/v) from the Ziptip. One μl of the eluent was mixed with 1 μl of matrix (sinnapinic acid (10 mg/ml) in acetic acid:acetonitrile:H2O (0.1:49.95:49.95, v/v/v)) and loaded onto a 100 well matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization plate. A PerSeptive BioSystems Voyager STR MS with high mass detector and Voyager NT 5.0 software (Framingham, MA) was used for the MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Calibration was done with apomyoglobin using the [M + H]+ = 16,952.6 Da and [2M + H]+ = 33,904.0 Da ions. Data were collected in linear mode, and 500 scans were averaged per spectrum. Capillary LC-ESI MS allowed for further purification and desalting of the reaction mixture. A capillary LC-ESI MS system was constructed using a Michrom BioResources Magic 2002 LC (Auburn, CA) operated with Ezchrom software (Scientific Software Inc., Pleasanton, CA) coupled to a Finnigan LCQ ion trap MS operated with Xcalibur version 1.2 software (San Jose, CA). A fused silica capillary (100 μm inner diameter × 200 μm outer diameter) with a needle tip was packed with C18 POROS R2 10-μm diameter beads (PerSeptive Biosystems) to a length of ∼10 cm under pressure. The LC was set to flow at 200–400 μl/min and split to a capillary flow rate of 0.3–0.8 μl/min. The reaction products were eluted and electrosprayed directly from the capillary needle tip into the mass spectrometer in 50 min using a linear gradient. The gradient went from 3% B to 98% B in 7 min (solvent A: 0.1% acetic acid in H2O; solvent B: 0.1% acetic acid in acetonitrile). To cause electrospray ionization, we made an electrical connection upstream from the column using a stainless steel union operated at ∼4.5 kV. NSC 663284 was dissolved in Me2SO at a compound to protein molar ratio of 30:1 and incubated with 60 μm (final concentration) recombinant human Cdc25A catalytic domain for 1 h at room temperature. An equal volume of Me2SO without NSC 663284 was used as vehicle control. The reaction mixtures were fractionated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue. The in-gel trypsin digestion was performed based on the published procedures (23Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the spots of interest were excised from the two-dimensional gel, rehydrated with ammonium bicarbonate buffer, destained with 50% acetonitrile in ammonium bicarbonate, and subjected to overnight digestion at 37 °C in the presence of 25 ng/μl sequencing grade modified trypsin without reduction and alkylation. Peptides were extracted with bicarbonate buffer followed by three changes of 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile. Extract volumes were reduced using a SpeedVac. Tryptic peptides were separated by microcapillary HPLC using a Rainin Gradient Biocompatible HPLC system (Varian, Inc., Walnut Creek, CA) operating at 0.4 ml/min. The flow was split to a usable flow rate of 150 nl/min using an Accurate Microflow Processor (LC Packings, Inc., San Francisco, CA). Buffers for gradient elution consisted of 0.1% acetic acid in water (buffer A) and 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid (buffer B). A 35-min linear gradient was run. Peptides were pressure-loaded onto a microcapillary column (75 μm inner diameter × 11 cm) packed with C18 Poros R2 10-μm diameter beads (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA). A stainless steel zero dead volume union was fitted to the end of the column to cause electrospray ionization, and the capillary size was reduced to 20 μm inner diameter. Peptides were eluted directly into a Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Inc., Beverly, MA). The capillary voltage was operated at 3.5 kV. Q1 was operated at unit resolution and Q3 slightly below unit resolution. The cone voltage was set to 25 V. The flow was paused as the peptides eluted. The collision energy (40 V) and CID gas (argon) were optimized during the runs. Scans in the MS mode were performed at 400 Da/s. Data were collected in the continuum mode and summed. Scans in the MS/MS mode were performed at 350 Da/s and stored as summed scans. We first examined the effect of NSC 663284 on cell cycle progression of tsFT210 cells, which are a convenient cell model because they can be synchronized without the use of chemicals (22Th'ng J.P.H. Wright P.S. Hamaguchi J. Lee M.G. Norbury C.J. Nurse P. Bradbury E.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 313-324Google Scholar). The typical cell cycle distribution we found when tsFT210 cells were cultured at the permissive temperature of 32.0 °C is shown in Fig. 1 and TableI with 49% of cells in G1phase, 28% in S phase, and 23% in G2/M phase. Seventeen hours after incubation at the nonpermissive temperature of 39.4 °C, ∼66% of tsFT210 cells were arrested in G2/M phase. The medium was then replaced with medium containing Me2SO vehicle alone or various compound concentrations. The cells were incubated at the permissive temperature of 32.0 °C for 6 h to allow the cells to reenter the cell cycle. As expected, we observed clear evidence of reentry into G1 phase (43%) with Me2SO vehicle-treated control cells. In contrast, two positive controls, 1 μm nocodazole and 20 μm Cpd 5, blocked cell cycle progression through G2/M phase and arrested 76 and 59% cells at G2/M phase, respectively. NSC 663284 arrested tsFT210 cells at G2/M phase in a concentration-dependent manner. Neither 0.1 nor 1 μm NSC 663284-treated tsFT210 cells demonstrated a block in cell cycle progression. However, treatment with NSC 663284 at 3 μm arrested ∼53% tsFT210 cells at G2/M phase. NSC 663284 at 10 and 30 μm caused more than 60% of the cells to arrest at G2/M.Table ICell cycle analysis of G2/M arrest by NSC 663284TimeTreatmentTotal cell populationG1SG2/M%0 h32.0 °Ccenter ± 228 ± 223 ± 217 h39.4 °C10 ± 224 ± 466 ± 56 h after releaseMe2SO43 ± 113 ± 144 ± 1Nocodazole (1 μm)7 ± 117 ± 176 ± 2Cpd 5 (20 μm)15 ± 226 ± 559 ± 4NSC 663284 (0.1 μm)41 ± 214 ± 146 ± 2NSC 663284 (1 μm)41 ± 113 ± 345 ± 3NSC 663284 (3 μm)26 ± 521 ± 553 ± 0NSC 663284 (10 μm)15 ± 124 ± 661 ± 6NSC 663284 (30 μm)13 ± 125 ± 762 ± 6tsFT210 cells were cultured at the permissive temperature of 32.0 °C. Incubation at the nonpermissive temperature of 39.4 °C for 17 h resulted in a prominent G2/M arrest.

Cells were then released by incubation at 32.0 °C in the presence of Me2SO, nocodazole, Cpd 5, or NSC 663284. Data are means from three independent experiments ± S.E. We next examined whether NSC 663284 could arrest tsFT210 cells at G1 phase by incubating G2/M phase-blocked cells at the permissive temperature of 32.0 °C for 6 h to allow cells to reenter the cell cycle. The resulting population had a cell cycle distribution of G1 phase (56%), S phase (9%), and G2 phase (35%) (Fig.2 and TableII). The medium was then replaced with medium containing Me2SO vehicle alone or various concentrations of compounds, and the cells were incubated at the permissive temperature of 32.0 °C for another 6 h. Fig. 2 and Table II showed that cells treated with Me2SO vehicle alone passed through G1 phase and had a broad S phase peak, with a cell cycle distribution of 29, 43, and 28% at G1, S, and G2/M phase, respectively. In contrast, cells treated with either 15 μm Cpd 5 or 50 μm roscovitine did not enter S phase, with 68 and 61% cells arrested at G1phase, respectively. NSC 663284 also arrested tsFT210 cells at G1 phase in a concentration-dependent manner. Cells treated with 0.1 μm NSC 663284 demonstrated a cell cycle distribution pattern similar to that seen with Me2SO treatment with 27% of cells at G1 phase. Cells exposed to 1 and 3 μm NSC 663284 demonstrated a small increase in the number of cells at G1 phase. Similar to the effects with Cpd 5 and roscovitine, treatment with NSC 663284 at either 10 or 30 μm arrested 67% of tsFT210 cells at G1phase.Table IICell cycle analysis of G1 arrest by NSC 663284TimeTreatmentTotal cell populationG1SG2/M%0 h32.0 °C49 ± 228 ± 223 ± 217 h39.4 °C10 ± 224 ± 466 ± 56 h after release32 °C56 ± 69 ± 135 ± 5Another 6 h after releaseMe2SO29 ± 043 ± 128 ± 1Cpd 5 (15 μm)68 ± 05 ± 127 ± 1Roscovitine (50 μm)62 ± 618 ± 220 ± 1NSC 663284 (0.1 μm)27 ± 143 ± 130 ± 0NSC 663284 (1 μm)33 ± 242 ± 125 ± 3NSC 663284 (3 μm)43 ± 540 ± 317 ± 2NSC 663284 (10 μm)67 ± 18 ± 225 ± 2NSC 663284 (30 μm)67 ± 16 ± 127 ± 1tsFT210 cells were cultured at the permissive temperature of 32.0 °C.

To delineate the molecular mechanisms of G1 phase-arrest induced by NSC 663284, we determined the kinase activity of Cdk2 in G1phase-arrested tsFT210 cells. As illustrated in Fig.3 A, we observed a concentration-dependent inhibition of Cdk2 kinase activity in NSC 663284-treated tsFT210 cells (lanes 2–4) as compared with that in vehicle-treated tsFT210 cells (lane 1). The positive controls from Cpd 5-treated (lane 5) and roscovitine-treated (lane 6) cells demonstrated decreased kinase activity as expected. Exposure of cells to increasing concentrations of NSC 663284 caused a gradual appearance of a slower migrating Cdk2 band (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2–4) when compared with that in vehicle-treated tsFT210 cells (Fig. 3 B, lane 1), indicating the inhibition of Cdk2 dephosphorylation. The expression level of the other G1/S phase transition regulators such as Cdc25A, c-Myc (16Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β1/2/3, cyclin D1, and cyclin E did not change with NSC 663284 treatment (data not shown). Because Cdk4 is also a G1/S phase transition regulator, we examined the kinase activity, the level, and phosphorylation status of Cdk4 in G1 phase-arrested tsFT210 cells. Fig.4 A showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of Cdk4 kinase activity by NSC 663284. The expression level and phosphorylation status of Cdk4 in cells treated with the compounds (Fig. 4 B,lanes 2–6) did not change as compared with that in vehicle-treated tsFT210 cells (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) except possibly with 10 μm NSC 663284 where a decrease in Cdk4 levels may have occurred (lane 4). Cdk1 plays a key role in G2/M phase transition. Fig.5 A demonstrated that a concentration-dependent inhibition of Cdk1 kinase activity by NSC 663284 in G2/M phase-arrested tsFT210 cells. A decreased Cdk1 kinase activity was also observed with Cpd 5-treated cells (positive control). As we noted previously (21Tamura K. Southwick E.C. Kerns J. Rosi K. Carr B.I. Wilcox C. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1317-1325Google Scholar), nocodazole, a microtubule inhibitor, did not inhibit Cdk1 kinase activity; instead, it increased activity. Exposure of cells to both 0.1 and 3 μm NSC 663284 caused the appearance of more slowly migrating Cdk1 bands (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2and 3) as compared with that in vehicle-treated tsFT210 cells (Fig. 5 B, lane 1), suggesting the hyperphosphorylation of Cdk1. The expression level and phosphorylation status of the other G2/M phase transition regulators such as Cdc25B, Cdc25C, and cyclin B1 did not change with NSC 663284 treatment (data not shown). The expression level and phosphorylation status of Cdk2 was also unchanged (Fig. 5 C), which is consistent with the role of Cdk2 in G1/S, and S/G2 phase transitions, but not in G"
https://openalex.org/W1975408970,"Many cell types undergo apoptosis when they are detached from the extracellular matrix (ECM). This phenomenon has been termed anoikis. Most epithelial cells, which are normally attached to a type of ECM called basement membrane, are particularly sensitive to anoikis. Conversely, carcinoma cells tend to be resistant to anoikis, and this resistance plays a critical role in tumor invasion and metastasis. We reported previously that detachment-induced down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-XLmakes a significant contribution to anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells. Here we demonstrate that exogenous Bcl-XL, no matter how highly expressed in these cells, can significantly attenuate anoikis but cannot completely prevent it, suggesting that at least another pro-apoptotic event is activated by the loss of cell-ECM contacts. Indeed, in this study we identified a novel mechanism of anoikis in intestinal epithelial cells that involves detachment-induced overexpression of Fas ligand. We also demonstrated that this elevation in Fas ligand expression requires a detachment-induced increase of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. We conclude that the activation of at least two different pro-apoptotic events is required for anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells.

Loss of cell-ECM contacts results in death of such cells by apoptosis, a phenomenon known as anoikis (1Meredith J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 2Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar, 3Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Induction of anoikis is now thought to play a critical role in several physiological processes such as cavitation during vertebrate development and mammary gland regression after weaning (4Meredith J.E. Schwartz M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 147-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 5Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin.

The process of cavitation transforms the solid embryonic ectoderm into a basement membrane-attached columnar epithelium surrounding a cavity. The cavity is generated by the apoptosis of the cells that are not attached to the basement membrane (7Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In the mammary gland cessation of lactation induces the secretion of metalloproteases that destroy the basement membrane to which milk-producing mammary epithelial cells are attached. As a consequence such cells undergo apoptosis that leads to mammary gland regression (8Strange R. Li F. Saurer S. Burkhardt A. Friis R.R. Development. 1992; 115: 49-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wiesen J. Werb Z. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 56: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Anoikis is also thought to play an important role in the elimination of intestinal epithelial cells shed into the intestinal lumen. The surface of the intestine is covered by a single layer of epithelial cells that differentiate as they migrate upwards along the intestinal crypts and villi to be eventually shed into the lumen. As these cells reach the top of the crypt or villi they detach from the basement membrane and undergo apoptosis (10Ikeda H. Suzuki Y. Suzuki M. Koike M. Tamura J. Tong J. Nomura M. Itoh G. Gut. 1998; 42: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Strater J. Wedding U. Barth T.F.E. Koretz K. Elsing C. Moller P.

Physiol. 1998; 274: G1117-G1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms of anoikis has increased significantly during the last few years as it became evident that resistance to anoikis is a critical requirement for invasion and metastasis in cancers derived from epithelial cells (3Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 13Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). A better understanding of anoikis could have an impact on the development of novel therapies for cancer, because it has been demonstrated that the reversion of anoikis resistance inhibits tumor progression (14Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,15Rosen K. Rak J. Jin J. Kerbel R.S. Newman M.J. Filmus J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1331-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Despite the increasing interest in the study of anoikis, the basic mechanisms of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Epithelial cells are known to attach to the ECM through specialized transmembrane receptors called integrins (5Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 16Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The loss of cell-ECM adhesion results in integrin disengagement as well as in rearrangement of the cell cytoskeleton. These events are known to lead to changes in the expression and/or activity of proteins that are directly involved in the control of apoptosis. As a consequence of these changes the apoptotic machinery becomes activated and anoikis is induced (6Grossmann J. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).It is now believed that programmed cell death is regulated by two major pathways. One of them involves the release of cytochrome cfrom the mitochondria into the cytoplasm where this molecule participates in the activation of caspases (17Hengartner H. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6206) Google Scholar, 18Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caspases are cysteine proteases that upon activation cleave a set of proteins critical for cell survival and thereby cause apoptosis (19Wang J. Lenardo M.J. J.

The release of cytochrome c is both positively and negatively controlled by members of the Bc-2 family. Some members of this family such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are anti-apoptotic, and others are pro-apoptotic (e.g. Bak, Bax, and Bid) (21Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Exp.

The second major pathway that triggers programmed cell death involves the activation of members of the death receptor family such as Fas, tumor necrosis factor receptor, DR-4, and DR-5 (23Locksley R.M.

In most cases these receptors are activated by their ligands, but ligand-independent mechanisms of activation have also been proposed (27Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B.

The activation of the death receptors induces the formation of the so-called death-inducing signaling complex. In addition to the receptors, this complex includes the adaptor FADD and caspases 8/10. Upon binding to death-inducing signaling complex these caspases are cleaved and activated and thus acquire the ability to trigger apoptosis (25Walczak H. Sprick M.R. Trends Biochem.

The initial reports (31Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) in this regard implicated the death receptor pathway in anoikis of some types of epithelial and endothelial cells. In addition to death receptor-mediated events, the mitochondria pathway has also been shown to participate in anoikis in that the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax changes its conformation and translocates to the mitochondria upon detachment of mammary epithelial cells (33Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.D. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Another study implicating the mitochondrial pathway in anoikis reported that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bmf, which is normally bound to the cytoskeleton in attached cells, migrates to the mitochondria upon cell detachment (34Puthalakath H. Villunger A. O'reilly L.A. Beaumont J.G. Coultas L. Cheney R.E. Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. Science. 2001; 293: 1829-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar).Recently we have described another mechanism of anoikis. We found that detachment of intestinal epithelial cells results in a significant down-regulation of Bcl-XL, and that ectopic expression of this anti-apoptotic molecule induces a significant inhibition of anoikis (14Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 35Rosen K. Loza Coll M. Li A. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37273-37279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the detachment-induced down-regulation of Bcl-XL is not exclusive of the intestinal epithelium, because it is also observed in human ovarian epithelial cells (36Frankel A.D. Rosen K. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4837-4841PubMed Google Scholar).The fact that the various studies on detachment-induced changes in components of the apoptotic machinery were performed in different cell types raises the question as to whether these changes are cell type-specific or whether more than one of these anoikis-triggering events occurs in the same cell type. We have recently started to investigate this question in intestinal epithelial cells, and we observed specific molecular events triggered by cell detachment which suggest that, in addition to the mitochondrial pathway, the death receptor pathway is also activated during anoikis (35Rosen K. Loza Coll M. Li A. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37273-37279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, whether this pathway plays a causal role in this form of apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells, which are the mechanisms of activation of the death receptor pathway in such cells are not known.Here we report that Fas receptor signaling is required for efficient anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that the activation of this pathway occurs because of the detachment-induced overexpression of Fas ligand, and that this increase in Fas ligand expression is mediated by an elevation in p38 MAP kinase activity.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have demonstrated that anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells requires detachment-induced increase in p38 MAP kinase activity, and subsequent p38 kinase-dependent overexpression of Fas ligand.Activation of the death receptor pathway during anoikis has been shown by others previously (31Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 54Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and appears to occur via distinct cell type-specific mechanisms. For example, anoikis of kidney and skin epithelial cells can be blocked by dominant negative FADD but not by decoy receptors that inhibit Fas ligand or TRAIL activity (31Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These data suggest that detachment-induced apoptosis of these types of cells is either triggered by one of the respective death receptors in a ligand-independent manner or that it is induced by death receptor(s) ligand(s) other than Fas ligand and TRAIL. In endothelial cells it has been found that anoikis requires the interaction between Fas ligand and its receptor (54Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, in these cells the main molecular events involved in the activation of the Fas receptor pathway in anoikis are the detachment-induced overexpression of Fas receptor, and the detachment-induced down-regulation of c-Flip, an inhibitor of apoptosis that blocks the interaction between FADD and caspases-8 and 10 (54). It can be concluded, therefore, that the activation of the Fas pathway plays an important role in anoikis but that the specific mechanism of activation of this receptor (and possibly other members of the death receptor family) depends on the particular cell type.One important discovery of this study is the involvement of p38 MAP kinase in anoikis. According to our data, detachment-induced elevation in p38 kinase activity is accompanied by an increase in p38 kinase expression. Normally this enzyme is known to be activated by MAP kinases such as MKK3 and/or MKK6 (55Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar). Whether elevated expression of p38 per se is sufficient for the increased p38 enzymatic activity observed during anoikis, or if other upstream MAP kinases need to be induced to achieve such activation, remains to be investigated.To our knowledge, activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway has not been associated previously with anoikis. However, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, another stress-associated enzyme, has been suggested to play a causal role in anoikis of Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (56Cardone M.H. Salvessen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), although this finding is controversial (57Khwaja A. Downward J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have reported previously (58Krestow J.K. Rak J. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation is not involved in anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells.Our finding that p38 kinase plays a role in the induction of Fas ligand expression during anoikis is consistent with previous reports implicating this kinase in the induction of Fas ligand expression in T lymphocytes, PC12, and 293 kidney cells (47Dermitzaki E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5977-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, in one of these reports (49Li L. Mao J. Sun L. Liu W. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5977-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) it has been demonstrated that p38 kinase can activate expression driven by the Fas ligand promoter.From the results obtained in this study and in previous ones (14Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Rosen K. Rak J. Jin J. Kerbel R.S. Newman M.J. Filmus J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1331-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells is triggered by at least two molecular events that are induced by cell detachment and which activate the apoptotic machinery: overexpression of Fas ligand, and down-regulation of Bcl-XL. Certainly, at the present time we cannot exclude the possibility that other pro-apoptotic molecular events are triggered by detachment of intestinal epithelial cells, because such events have been described in other cell types (33Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.D. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar,34Puthalakath H. Villunger A. O'reilly L.A. Beaumont J.G. Coultas L. Cheney R.E. Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. Science. 2001; 293: 1829-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar).Based on our results, Fas ligand-deficient mice would be expected to contain a higher proportion of viable cells in the gut lumen than their wild type counterparts. Specific technical approaches aimed at measuring apoptosis of cells in the lumen will have to be developed to study this problem.Another interesting finding of this study is that Bcl-XLcan modulate Fas-induced signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. It is reasonable to propose, therefore, that this modulation plays a significant role in the induction of anoikis. In several cell types members of the Bcl-2 family have been shown to be able to protect from death receptor-induced apoptosis (53Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 59Nagata S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E143-E145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is now understood that in such cells the Fas pathway is unable to activate threshold amounts of caspases unless the mitochondrial pathway contributes to caspase activation by releasing pro-apoptotic molecules such as cytochromec and Smac/Diablo (59Nagata S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E143-E145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 60Li S. Zhao Y. He X. Kim T.H. Kuharsky D.K. Rabinowich H. Chen J. Du C. Yin X.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11345-11351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The latter is known to induce apoptosis by blocking the activity of the IAPs, which are potent inhibitors of caspases (62Ekert P.G. Silke J. Hawkins C.J. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic role of Smac/Diablo is critical for the induction of apoptosis in cells that express high levels of IAPs (60Li S. Zhao Y. He X. Kim T.H. Kuharsky D.K. Rabinowich H. Chen J. Du C. Yin X.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26912-26920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported recently (63Ruemmele F.M. Beaulieu J.F. O'Connell J. Bennett M.W. Seidman E.G. Lentze M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that in intestinal epithelial cells susceptibility to apoptosis by Fas ligand can be regulated by IAPs. It is therefore possible that in such cells the ratio between Smac/Diablo and IAPs is regulated by Bcl-XL and thereby plays a critical role in anoikis. Survival of most normal epithelial cells requires adhesion to a type of extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used for: ECM, extracellular matrix; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; IEC, intestinal epithelial cells; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; d.n., dominant negative; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IAPs, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. 1The abbreviations used for: ECM, extracellular matrix; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; IEC, intestinal epithelial cells; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; d.n., dominant negative; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IAPs, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. called basement membrane. Loss of cell-ECM contacts results in death of such cells by apoptosis, a phenomenon known as anoikis (1Meredith J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 2Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar, 3Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Induction of anoikis is now thought to play a critical role in several physiological processes such as cavitation during vertebrate development and mammary gland regression after weaning (4Meredith J.E. Schwartz M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 147-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 5Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 6Grossmann J. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The process of cavitation transforms the solid embryonic ectoderm into a basement membrane-attached columnar epithelium surrounding a cavity. The cavity is generated by the apoptosis of the cells that are not attached to the basement membrane (7Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 279-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In the mammary gland cessation of lactation induces the secretion of metalloproteases that destroy the basement membrane to which milk-producing mammary epithelial cells are attached. As a consequence such cells undergo apoptosis that leads to mammary gland regression (8Strange R. Li F. Saurer S. Burkhardt A. Friis R.R. Development. 1992; 115: 49-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wiesen J. Werb Z. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 56: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Anoikis is also thought to play an important role in the elimination of intestinal epithelial cells shed into the intestinal lumen. The surface of the intestine is covered by a single layer of epithelial cells that differentiate as they migrate upwards along the intestinal crypts and villi to be eventually shed into the lumen. As these cells reach the top of the crypt or villi they detach from the basement membrane and undergo apoptosis (10Ikeda H. Suzuki Y. Suzuki M. Koike M. Tamura J. Tong J. Nomura M. Itoh G. Gut. 1998; 42: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Strater J. Wedding U. Barth T.F.E. Koretz K. Elsing C. Moller P.

Physiol. 1998; 274: G1117-G1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms of anoikis has increased significantly during the last few years as it became evident that resistance to anoikis is a critical requirement for invasion and metastasis in cancers derived from epithelial cells (3Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 13Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). A better understanding of anoikis could have an impact on the development of novel therapies for cancer, because it has been demonstrated that the reversion of anoikis resistance inhibits tumor progression (14Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,15Rosen K. Rak J. Jin J. Kerbel R.S. Newman M.J. Filmus J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1331-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the increasing interest in the study of anoikis, the basic mechanisms of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Epithelial cells are known to attach to the ECM through specialized transmembrane receptors called integrins (5Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 16Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The loss of cell-ECM adhesion results in integrin disengagement as well as in rearrangement of the cell cytoskeleton. These events are known to lead to changes in the expression and/or activity of proteins that are directly involved in the control of apoptosis. As a consequence of these changes the apoptotic machinery becomes activated and anoikis is induced (6Grossmann J. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). It is now believed that programmed cell death is regulated by two major pathways. One of them involves the release of cytochrome cfrom the mitochondria into the cytoplasm where this molecule participates in the activation of caspases (17Hengartner H. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6206) Google Scholar, 18Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caspases are cysteine proteases that upon activation cleave a set of proteins critical for cell survival and thereby cause apoptosis (19Wang J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 753-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c is both positively and negatively controlled by members of the Bc-2 family. Some members of this family such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are anti-apoptotic, and others are pro-apoptotic (e.g. Bak, Bax, and Bid) (21Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar,22Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4775) Google Scholar). The second major pathway that triggers programmed cell death involves the activation of members of the death receptor family such as Fas, tumor necrosis factor receptor, DR-4, and DR-5 (23Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 24Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev.

In most cases these receptors are activated by their ligands, but ligand-independent mechanisms of activation have also been proposed (27Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B.

The activation of the death receptors induces the formation of the so-called death-inducing signaling complex. In addition to the receptors, this complex includes the adaptor FADD and caspases 8/10. Upon binding to death-inducing signaling complex these caspases are cleaved and activated and thus acquire the ability to trigger apoptosis (25Walczak H. Sprick M.R. Trends Biochem.

Recently we have described another mechanism of anoikis. We found that detachment of intestinal epithelial cells results in a significant down-regulation of Bcl-XL, and that ectopic expression of this anti-apoptotic molecule induces a significant inhibition of anoikis (14Rosen K.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 54Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and appears to occur via distinct cell type-specific mechanisms. For example, anoikis of kidney and skin epithelial cells can be blocked by dominant negative FADD but not by decoy receptors that inhibit Fas ligand or TRAIL activity (31Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These data suggest that detachment-induced apoptosis of these types of cells is either triggered by one of the respective death receptors in a ligand-independent manner or that it is induced by death receptor(s) ligand(s) other than Fas ligand and TRAIL. In endothelial cells it has been found that anoikis requires the interaction between Fas ligand and its receptor (54Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, in these cells the main molecular events involved in the activation of the Fas receptor pathway in anoikis are the detachment-induced overexpression of Fas receptor, and the detachment-induced down-regulation of c-Flip, an inhibitor of apoptosis that blocks the interaction between FADD and caspases-8 and 10 (54). It can be concluded, therefore, that the activation of the Fas pathway plays an important role in anoikis but that the specific mechanism of activation of this receptor (and possibly other members of the death receptor family) depends on the particular cell type.One important discovery of this study is the involvement of p38 MAP kinase in anoikis. According to our data, detachment-induced elevation in p38 kinase activity is accompanied by an increase in p38 kinase expression. Normally this enzyme is known to be activated by MAP kinases such as MKK3 and/or MKK6 (55Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar). Whether elevated expression of p38 per se is sufficient for the increased p38 enzymatic activity observed during anoikis, or if other upstream MAP kinases need to be induced to achieve such activation, remains to be investigated.To our knowledge, activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway has not been associated previously with anoikis. However, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, another stress-associated enzyme, has been suggested to play a causal role in anoikis of Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (56Cardone M.H. Salvessen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), although this finding is controversial (57Khwaja A. Downward J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have reported previously (58Krestow J.K. Rak J. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation is not involved in anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells.Our finding that p38 kinase plays a role in the induction of Fas ligand expression during anoikis is consistent with previous reports implicating this kinase in the induction of Fas ligand expression in T lymphocytes, PC12, and 293 kidney cells (47Dermitzaki E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5977-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) it has been demonstrated that p38 kinase can activate expression driven by the Fas ligand promoter.From the results obtained in this study and in previous ones (14Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Rosen K. Rak J. Jin J. Kerbel R.S. Newman M.J. Filmus J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1331-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells is triggered by at least two molecular events that are induced by cell detachment and which activate the apoptotic machinery: overexpression of Fas ligand, and down-regulation of Bcl-XL. Certainly, at the present time we cannot exclude the possibility that other pro-apoptotic molecular events are triggered by detachment of intestinal epithelial cells, because such events have been described in other cell types (33Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.D. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar,34Puthalakath H. Villunger A. O'reilly L.A. Beaumont J.G. Coultas L. Cheney R.E. Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. Science. 2001; 293: 1829-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar).Based on our results, Fas ligand-deficient mice would be expected to contain a higher proportion of viable cells in the gut lumen than their wild type counterparts. Specific technical approaches aimed at measuring apoptosis of cells in the lumen will have to be developed to study this problem.Another interesting finding of this study is that Bcl-XLcan modulate Fas-induced signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. It is reasonable to propose, therefore, that this modulation plays a significant role in the induction of anoikis. In several cell types members of the Bcl-2 family have been shown to be able to protect from death receptor-induced apoptosis (53Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

It is now understood that in such cells the Fas pathway is unable to activate threshold amounts of caspases unless the mitochondrial pathway contributes to caspase activation by releasing pro-apoptotic molecules such as cytochromec and Smac/Diablo (59Nagata S.

The latter is known to induce apoptosis by blocking the activity of the IAPs, which are potent inhibitors of caspases (62Ekert P.G. Silke J. Hawkins C.J. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic role of Smac/Diablo is critical for the induction of apoptosis in cells that express high levels of IAPs (60Li S. Zhao Y. He X. Kim T.H. Kuharsky D.K. Rabinowich H. Chen J. Du C.

Commun. 2002; 290: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that in intestinal epithelial cells susceptibility to apoptosis by Fas ligand can be regulated by IAPs. It is therefore possible that in such cells the ratio between Smac/Diablo and IAPs is regulated by Bcl-XL and thereby plays a critical role in anoikis.

Ganglioside GM3 inhibits EGFR autophosphorylation and may thus affect the interaction of caveolin-1 and the EGFR. We report here that endogenous overexpression of GM3 leads to the clustering of GM3 on the cell membrane of the keratinocyte-derived SCC12 cell line and promotes co-immunoprecipitation of caveolin-1 and GM3 with the EGFR. Overexpression of GM3 does not affect EGFR distribution but shifts caveolin-1 to the detergent-soluble, EGFR-containing region; consistently, caveolin-1 is retained in the detergent-insoluble membrane when ganglioside is depleted. GM3 overexpression inhibits EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and receptor dimerization and concurrently increases both the content and tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR-associated caveolin-1, providing evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 inhibits EGFR signaling. Consistently, depletion of ganglioside both increases EGFR phosphorylation and prevents the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. GM3 also induces delayed serine phosphorylation of EGFR-unassociated caveolin-1, suggesting a role for serine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in regulating EGFR signaling. These studies suggest that GM3 modulates the caveolin-1/EGFR association and is critical for the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 that is associated with its inhibition of EGFR activation.

The plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells is not uniform and instead is composed of microdomains or rafts, highly dynamic lateral assemblies composed of glycosphingolipids and cholesterol. One form of these rafts, caveolae, has been distinguished ultrastructurally by its invaginated shape and by the presence of caveolin-1, the major structural protein of caveolae. These caveolin-containing rafts are insoluble in both nonionic detergents, such as Triton X-100, and in sodium carbonate at alkaline pH and can be isolated as low density fractions by sucrose density gradient. Although caveolae have been implicated as sites at which receptors and signaling molecules interact (1Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar, 2Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Google Scholar), signaling also occurs at noninvaginated rafts, devoid of caveolin-1 but enriched in glycosphingolipids (3Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15174-15181Google Scholar). In addition, caveolin-1 may also exist in lipid rafts without caveolae (6Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Google Scholar). The distinction between lipid rafts and caveolae and the attribution of specific biologic functions and signaling pathways to one or the other remains confusing in the literature (7Sowa G. Pypaert M. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14072-14077Google Scholar). Caveolae have been proposed to be the site of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; DMEM/F-12, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) mixture; FBS, fetal bovine serum; pcDNA, SCC12 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3 vector; PPPP, threo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoyl-amino-3-pyrrolidinopropan-1-ol HCl; SSIA, SCC12 cells stably transfected with ganglioside-specific human sialidase cDNA; GD2, GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcα2→8NeuAcα2→3)Galβ1→4Glcβ1-Cer; GD3, NeuAcα2→8NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4Glcβ1-Cer; GM1, Galβ1→3GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcα2→3)Galβ1→4Glcβ1-Cer; GM2, GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcα2→3)Galβ1→4Glcβ1-Cer; GM3, NeuAcα2→3 Galβ1→4Glcβ1-Cer; GT1b, NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→3GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcα2→8NeuAcα2→3)Galβ1→4Glcβ1-Cer signaling, including EGFR autophosphorylation, based largely on the demonstration that caveolin-1 and EGFR both co-localize to low density, carbonate-insoluble membrane regions (8Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.G. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Google Scholar, 9Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Google Scholar, 10Couet J.

However, caveolin-1 and EGFR can be separated by differences in solubility in nonionic detergent, with EGFR restricted to the detergent-soluble high buoyancy, low density membrane regions (12Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Google Scholar), and are rarely able to be co-immunoprecipitated when co-localized in carbonate-insoluble membrane (12Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy localization studies show only a small proportion of the EGFR in caveolae (13Ringerike T. Blystad F.D. Levy F.O. Madshus I.H. Stang E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1331-1340Google Scholar), further suggesting that EGFR is largely localized in noncaveolar membrane domains. Nevertheless, the evidence for an interaction between caveolin-1 and the EGFR that suppresses EGFR activation is strong. Depletion of caveolin-1 has been associated with tumor proliferation (14Hayashi K. Matsuda S. Machida K. Yamamoto T. Fukuda Y. Nimura Y. Hayakawa T. Hamaguchi M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2361-2364Google Scholar), psoriasis, a hyperproliferative skin disorder, and stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (15Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Google Scholar). In addition, re-expression of caveolin-1 in oncogenically transformed cells and in human breast cancer cells inhibits cell growth (16Engelman J.A. Wykoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Google Scholar, 17Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbell D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Google Scholar). The “scaffolding domain” of caveolin-1 has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with and bind directly to the binding sequence motifs in the kinase domain of the EGFR (10Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Google Scholar, 18Razani B. Schlegel A. Liu J. Lisanti M.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 494-499Google Scholar). A regulatory role of caveolin-1 in EGFR signaling is further suggested by the suppression of cell proliferation and EGF-induced migration when caveolin-1 binds to the EGFR (19Zhang W. Razani B. Altschuler Y. Bouzahzah B. Mostov K.E. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20717-20725Google Scholar). These studies suggest a role for caveolin-1 in maintaining the EGFR in an inactive state, with dissociation from caveolin-1 promoting EGFR activation. The role of phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in EGFR signaling is unknown. EGF is able to tyrosine-phosphorylate caveolin-1 in A-431 cells (20Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M.

The effect of this tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on EGFR activity, however, is controversial (20Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Google Scholar), and the effect of ganglioside on caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation has not been explored. Caveolin-1 also has 12 putative sites for serine phosphorylation that are highly conserved (22Schlegel A. Arvan P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4398-4408Google Scholar). Of these sites, only mutation at Ser80 blocks its serine phosphorylation. Schlegel et al. (22Schlegel A. Arvan P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4398-4408Google Scholar) have recently suggested that the phosphorylation site at Ser80 is required for endoplasmic reticulum retention and caveolin-1 secretion and for homo-oligomerization; other roles for serine phosphorylation of caveolin-1, including in signaling, have not been determined. Gangliosides are sialylated membrane glycosphingolipids that modulate several biologic processes of keratinocytes and keratinocyte-derived cell lines in vitro, including cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis, at least in part by affecting transmembrane signaling (23Paller A.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44504-44511Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory and others have shown that GM3, the predominant ganglioside of the membranes of both normal cultured keratinocytes and the keratinocyte-derived SCC12 cell line (26Wang X. Rahman Z. Sun P. Meuillet E. George D. Bremer E.G. Al-Qamari A. Paller A.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 69-76Google Scholar, 30Paller A.S. Arnsmeier S.L. Robinson J.K. Bremer E.G. J. Invest.

Dermatol. 2001; 116: 69-76Google Scholar). The mechanism for this ganglioside-specific inhibition appears to involve both binding of GM3 directly to the EGFR that requires receptor glycosylation (28Wang X.Q. Sun P. O'Gorman M. Tai T. Paller A.S. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 515-522Google Scholar) and direct postbinding effects on signal transduction (26Wang X. Rahman Z. Sun P. Meuillet E. George D. Bremer E.G. Al-Qamari A. Paller A.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 69-76Google Scholar, 28Wang X.Q. Sun P. O'Gorman M. Tai T. Paller A.S. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 515-522Google Scholar). Consistently, endogenous depletion of gangliosides, including GM3, by stable transfection of SCC12 cells with sialidase cDNA leads to cell hyperproliferation and stimulation of EGFR signaling, especially in response to EGFR ligands (26Wang X. Rahman Z. Sun P. Meuillet E. George D. Bremer E.G. Al-Qamari A. Paller A.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 69-76Google Scholar). Although ganglioside GM1 is considered a marker for caveolae (32Parton R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 155-166Google Scholar, 33Fra A.M. Masserini M. Palestini P. Sonnino S. Simons K.

Acta. 2000; 1486: 265-274Google Scholar) also probably localizes to caveolar domains, GM3 has been localized predominantly to carbonate- and detergent-insoluble low density “glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane” regions (4Iwabuchi K. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33766-33773Google Scholar). Its relationship with caveolin-1 is unclear (5Iwabuchi K. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Taking advantage of the distinct localizations of EGFR and caveolin-1 after detergent separation of membrane domains, we investigated the effects of endogenous modulation of ganglioside GM3 expression on caveolin-1 distribution, phosphorylation, and interaction with the EGFR. Our studies show that endogenous overexpression of GM3 promotes transport of caveolin-1 from the Triton X-100-insoluble, low density membrane regions to the soluble, high density domains in which EGFR predominates. GM3 overexpression increases both the association of caveolin-1 with EGFR and the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1, which may contribute to suppression of both EGFR dimerization and autophosphorylation. GM3 also induces the later phosphorylation of serine residues on caveolin-1 that is unassociated with EGFR. These results suggest a possible mechanism by which GM3 regulates the suppression of EGFR activation. Human keratinocyte-derived cell line SCC12F2 cells, a generous gift from Dr. James Rheinwald (Harvard, Boston, MA), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (DMEM/F-12) (Invitrogen) (1:1) medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) without antibiotics in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To endogenously increase the membrane content of GM3 on SCC12 cells, SCC12 cells were pretreated with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides of both GM2/GD2 synthase and GD3 synthase, leading to blockade of synthetic pathways downstream of GM3 (Fig. 1 A). The synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides were generated complementary to either the sense or the antisense strand of the 21 nucleotides at the 5′-end encoding human GM2/GD2 synthase or GD3 synthase (41Zeng G. Ariga T. Gu X.B. Yu R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8670-8674Google Scholar), including the initiator codon ATG. These included 5′-GACAGGATGTGGCTGGGCCGC-3′ (GM2/GD2 synthase sense oligodeoxynucleotide), 5′-GCGGCCCAGCCACATCCTGTC-3′ (GM2/GD2 synthase antisense oligodeoxynucleotide), 5′-AGAGGGGCCATGGCTGTACTG-3′ (GD3 synthase sense oligodeoxynucleotide), and 5′-CAGTACAGCCATGGCCCCTCT-3′ (GD3 synthase antisense oligodeoxynucleotide). Cells were incubated with DMEM/F-12 medium containing a 40 μm concentration of both GM2/GD2 synthase and GD3 synthase oligodeoxynucleotides at 37 °C for 30 min. FBS was then added to a final concentration of 10%. The oligodeoxynucleotides were refreshed every other day for 3–7 days. Gangliosides, including GM3, were depleted both by stable gene transfection and biochemically. SCC12 cells were stably transfected with human plasma membrane ganglioside-specific sialidase cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number AB008185; courtesy of Dr. T. Miyagi, Tokyo, Japan) (42Wada T. Yoshikawa Y. Tokuyama S. Kuwabara M. Akita H. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 21-27Google Scholar) in a pcDNA3 vector using LipofectAMINE reagent (43Sun P. Wang X.Q. Lopatka K. Bangash S. Paller A.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 107-117Google Scholar), following the techniques described for stable transfection of cytosolic hamster sialidase cDNA (26Wang X. Rahman Z. Sun P. Meuillet E. George D. Bremer E.G. Al-Qamari A. Paller A.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 69-76Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). Gene and protein expression in the resultant “SSIA cells” were demonstrated by Northern blot, sialidase activity measurements, and ganglioside depletion shown by thin layer chromatography (TLC) immunostaining as described (43Sun P. Wang X.Q. Lopatka K. Bangash S. Paller A.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 107-117Google Scholar), in comparison with parental SCC12 cells and the pcDNA3 mock transfectant control (pcDNA). Four SSIA cell lines (SSIA3, SSIA6, SSIA12, and SSIA25) and two mock-transfected pcDNA cell lines were studied. Synthesis of glycosphingolipids was also inhibited by treating SCC12 cells with 2 μm racemicthreo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoyl-amino-3-pyrrolidinopropan-1-ol, HCl (PPPP; Calbiochem) for 5 days. PPPP inhibits the activity of glucosylceramide synthase, preventing the formation of glucosylceramide, a precursor for GM3 (Fig. 1 A), but in contrast to 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol does not significantly increase ceramide content (44Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipkin R.E. Sivakumar R. Ruggieri J.M. Carson K.G. Ganem B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 611-621Google Scholar). Overexpression and depletion of GM3 were confirmed using ganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, TLC immunostaining, and immunofluorescence microscopy. SSIA cells, mock pcDNA transfectants, and parental SCC12 cells were treated with or without either oligodeoxynucleotides or PPPP. Cells were transferred to 96-well plates, grown for 6–8 h, and then fixed for ganglioside detection as described in the legend to Fig. 2. To examine whether endogenous accumulation of GM3 modulates EGFR dimerization as a means to influence EGFR signaling, SCC12 cells were treated with or without sense or antisense oligonucleotides and then stimulated with 10 nm EGF for 10 min, followed by treatment with sulfosuccinimidyl 4-[p-maleimidophenyl]butyrate (Pierce), a cross-linker that is membrane-impermeable and hence does not cross-link the receptor's cytoplasmic domain and its interacting signaling molecules within the cell. EGFR dimerization was determined by immunoblotting using whole cell lysate. Membranes were extracted with carbonate by the method of Song et al. (45Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Google Scholar) or with detergent by the method of Waugh et al. (12Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Google Scholar). In brief, cells reaching 90% confluence were scraped into either 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0 (45Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Google Scholar), or 2 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (12Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitors and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells in suspension were then disrupted by Dounce homogenization and sonication. Nuclei and large cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 1,200 × g for 5 min. The postnuclear supernatant was subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation as previously described (12Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Google Scholar, 45Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Google Scholar). The opaque low density fragments and clear high density fragments were separated as insoluble and soluble fragments. All procedures were conducted at 4 °C. Equal amounts of total protein from either soluble or insoluble fragments were mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli buffer and separated by an SDS-PAGE minigel, followed by immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.0 mmNa3VO4) and boiled, and protein was collected by centrifugation. Soluble protein was mixed with 5 μg of an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem) that specifically recognizes the extracellular domain or with anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and then 50% protein A-agarose (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) was added as previously described (27Wang X. Sun P. Al-Qamari A. Tai T. Kawashima I. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8436-8444Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out as described (27Wang X. Sun P. Al-Qamari A. Tai T. Kawashima I. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8436-8444Google Scholar) using enhanced chemiluminescence. Protein from either immunoprecipitates or cell lysates was treated with Laemmli buffer and loaded onto SDS-PAGE minigels. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes, the separated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the extracellular domain (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), phospho-EGFR, caveolin-1, phosphotyrosine (PY20) (Transduction Laboratories), or phosphoserine (Calbiochem) or with antibodies directed against. Blots were reprobed as previously described (29Wang X.Q. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44504-44511Google Scholar) with anti-actin antibody to confirm equal loading. Bound antibody was detected using enhanced chemiluminscence, and band density was analyzed by the Storm 800 PhosphorImager. Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± S.D. All data were analyzed statistically by Student's ttest, with p < 0.05 considered significant. TLC immunostaining and ganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were employed to detect ganglioside expression after SCC12 cells were treated with or without sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides of both GM2/GD2 synthase and GD3 synthase. GM3 expression in SCC12 cells was increased ∼2-fold by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment, which also prevented the synthesis of downstream gangliosides, in comparison with untreated and sense-treated cells (Fig.2, A and B) (p < 0.01). Overexpression of a human plasma membrane ganglioside-specific sialidase cDNA totally depleted SCC12 cell membrane gangliosides as detected by TLC immunostaining (Fig.2 A, lane 5). Alterations in the pattern of GM3 expression were observed by immunofluorescence microscopy. SCC12 cells subjected to ganglioside-specific sialidase transfection (Fig. 2 C (c)) or PPPP treatment (not shown) showed no detectable GM3 expression. On the other hand, immunofluorescence examination of SCC12 cells treated with the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide revealed clustering of GM3 at the membrane (Fig. 2 C (a), arrows) and intracellularly in comparison with the homogeneous pericellular staining of untreated (Fig. 2 C (b),arrows) and sense oligomer-treated (not shown) controls. Endogenous accumulation of GM3 inhibited EGFR autophosphorylation. (Fig. 3 A,bottom row, lane 4) and blocked EGFR dimerization (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) in comparison with untreated cells (Fig. 3, A(bottom row, lane 2) andB (lane 1)) and cells treated with sense oligodeoxynucleotides (Fig. 3, A (bottom row, lane 3) and B(lane 2)). GM3 accumulation had no effect on EGFR expression (Fig. 3 A, top row). Immunoprecipitation of membrane EGFR from whole cell lysates with GM3 overexpression showed a doubling of caveolin-1 (p < 0.01) (Fig.4, middle row,lane 3) and a 4-fold increase in GM3 (p < 0.001) in association with the EGFR (Fig. 4,bottom row, lane 3), in contrast with untreated (Fig. 4, middle andbottom rows, lane 1) and sense oligomer-treated (Fig. 4, middle and bottom rows, lane 2) controls, indicating that overexpressed GM3 complexes with EGFR and caveolin-1. GM3 overexpression did not affect either EGFR or caveolin-1 expression (not shown). The relative localizations of ganglioside GM3, caveolin-1, and EGFR within cell membranes were detected using sodium carbonate and detergent separation techniques. Results indicated that GM3, caveolin-1, and EGFR all localized to the carbonate-insoluble membrane, regardless of GM3 content (Fig.5 A). However, treatment of membranes with detergent allowed separation of caveolin-1 and EGFR. Membrane EGFR was found only in Triton X-100-soluble membrane microdomains (Fig. 5 B and C, top rows), and the alteration of GM3 expression had no effect on either the expression (not shown) or distribution of the EGFR (Fig. 5,B (top row, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) andC (top row)). In contrast, caveolin-1 shifted from the Triton X-100-insoluble membrane microdomains into soluble membrane microdomains that contained the EGFR when GM3 was overexpressed (Fig. 5 B, middle row,lanes 3 and 7). Consistently, endogenous ganglioside depletion by treatment with PPPP (Fig.5 B, middle row, lanes 4 and 8) or sialidase overexpression (Fig.5 C, middle row) retained caveolin-1 in the insoluble membrane domain, away from effective interaction with the EGFR. In untreated and sense oligomer-treated cells, expression of GM3 was limited to the detergent-insoluble membrane domains (Fig.5 B, bottom row, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6); however, overexpression of GM3 in the SCC12 cells led to increased GM3 content in both the detergent-soluble and -insoluble membrane regions (Fig.5 B, bottom row, lanes 3 and 7). Treatment with PPPP or overexpression of sialidase depleted GM3 (Fig. 5, B (bottom row, lanes 4 and 8) andC (bottom row)). Endogenous overexpression of GM3 strongly promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in association with EGFR by 10 min after exposure to EGFR ligand (Fig.6 A, fourth row, lane 7), increasing it by 4.2-fold in comparison with untreated or sense oligomer-treated cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 6 A, fourth row, lanes 5 and 6). Concurrently, overexpression of GM3 inhibited the autophosphorylation of EGFR by 4.1-fold (Fig. 6 A, second row, lane 7) in comparison with untreated or sense oligomer-treated cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 6 A, second row, lanes 5 and 6) after stimulation with either 10 nm EGF or 12 nm transforming growth factor-α (not shown). Ligand stimulation had no effect on the sustained GM3-induced doubling of the amount of caveolin-1 associated with EGFR (Fig. 6 A, third row,lanes 4, 7, 10, and13). However, without exposure to EGF, caveolin-1 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated, regardless of the increase in GM3 (Fig.6 A, fourth row, lane 4). When ganglioside was depleted by sialidase overexpression (Fig. 6 B, fourth row,lanes 7, 10, and 13) or PPPP treatment (not shown), EGF was unable to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in association with the EGFR. Ganglioside depletion also diminished the co-immunoprecipitation of caveolin-1 with EGFR in both sialidase overexpressors (Fig. 6 B,third row, lanes 4,7, 10, and 13) and PPPP-treated cells (not shown) by almost 2-fold (p < 0.01), regardless of ligand stimulation. Under these conditions, EGFR autophosphorylation was increased by 3.8-fold within 10 min after stimulation with either 10 nm EGF (Fig. 6 B, second row, lane 7) or 12 nmtransforming growth factor-α (not shown), in comparison with parental SCC12 cells and mock pcDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6 B,second row, lanes 5 and6; p < 0.001). Endogenous overexpression of GM3 had no effect on the weak tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 unassociated with the EGFR (Fig.7 A, middle row). Consistently, decreasing GM3 expression also had no effect on the weak tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 that was not associated with the EGFR (Fig. 7 B, middle row).Figure 7Endogenous accumulation of GM3 up-regulates delayed serine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 that is unassociated with EGFR. SCC12 cells pretreated with or without oligodeoxynucleotides (A) or PPPP (B) were stimulated without or with 10 nm EGF for 10, 30, and 60 min after starving of both serum and growth factors. After immunoprecipitation of EGFR, the remaining cell lysate was incubated with polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody to immunoprecipitate caveolin-1 unassociated with the EGFR as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Purity and equal loading of caveolin-1 was checked with anti-caveolin-1 monoclonal antibody (A and B, top rows). Caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was detected with PY20 antibody (A and B, middle rows), and serine phosphorylation was detected with anti-phosphoserine antibody (A and B, bottom rows). Thefirst lane of A and B shows a positive control for antibody binding. Lanes 2,5, 8, and 11, untreated (Aand B); lanes 3, 6,9, and 12 sense-treated (A) or dimethyl sulfoxide 0.1% vehicle-treated control (B);lanes 4, 7, 10, and13, antisense-treated (A) or PPPP-treated cells (B). Immunoblots were performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of ganglioside GM3 on serine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 was also determined using immunoblotting. Caveolin-1 in association with the immunoprecipitated EGFR was never serine-phosphorylated, regardless of GM3 content (Fig. 6, A and B,bottom rows). However, caveolin-1 unassociated with the EGFR was strongly serine-phosphorylated when GM3 was endogenously overexpressed after stimulation for 30 min with either 10 nm EGF (Fig. 7 A, bottom row, lane 10) or 12 nmtransforming growth factor-α (not shown). Serine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 unassociated with EGFR was increased by 4.6-fold at 30 min after stimulation with 10 nm EGF (Fig. 7 A,bottom row, lane 10). In contrast, the endogenous decrease in GM3 expression induced by either PPPP treatment (Fig. 7 B, bottom row,lanes 7, 10, and 13) or sialidase overexpression (not shown) decreased the serine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 unassociated with EGFR by 2–3-fold after stimulation with 10 nm EGF. Signaling in membranes is now thought to be facilitated by compartmentalization of interacting molecules. We have investigated the possibility that ganglioside GM3 mobilizes caveolin-1 to colocalize with the EGFR and thereby regulate receptor function. To most closely simulate endogenous shifts in ganglioside expression, gene modulation was selected as a means to manipulate ganglioside content rather than the pharmacologic addition of ganglioside. The resulting endogenous overexpression of GM3 led to clustering of GM3 at the membrane and intracellularly in comparison with the homogeneous pericellular staining of control cells, suggesting that overexpressed GM3 clusters within specific functional membrane domains. The increased co-immunoprecipitation of caveolin-1 and the EGFR with GM3 when GM3 is overexpressed provided evidence of co-clustering of these three membrane components. The differences in the distribution of caveolin-1 and the EGFR after membrane extraction with detergent versus carbonate provide a means to investigate biochemically the effects of manipulation of ganglioside content on the relative localizations of caveolin-1 and the EGFR within membranes. Our discovery that endogenous manipulation of GM3 content leads to shifts of caveolin-1 in the membrane to allow juxtaposition of caveolin-1 with the EGFR in detergent-soluble membrane domains is consistent with the recent demonstration that GM3 shifts of caveolin-1 from detergent-insoluble to detergent-soluble membrane in association with integrins α5 and α3by galactose-induced synthesis of GM3 in a Chinese hamster ovary mutant cell line (46Kazui A. Ono M. Handa K. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 159-163Google Scholar). Importantly, our finding that the caveolin-1/EGFR interaction is associated with the inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation and dimerization supports the speculation by Couetet al. (10Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Google Scholar) that caveolin binding to the EGFR stabilizes the receptor kinase in an inactive conformation and prevents receptor dimerization. Previous studies with exogenous addition of GM3 have demonstrated that GM3 inhibits EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR but does not affect receptor-receptor interaction (47Zhou Q. Hakomori S. Kitamura K. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1959-1965Google Scholar). Our demonstration that endogenous overexpression of GM3 inhibits EGFR dimerization suggests a greater local concentration of endogenously overexpressed GM3 or a difference in orientation of endogenous versus exogenously added GM3, allowing inhibition of receptor dimerization. We propose that overexpression of GM3 inhibits EGFR phosphorylation by (a) binding directly to the extracellular region of the EGFR (28Wang X.Q. Sun P. O'Gorman M. Tai T. Paller A.S. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 515-522Google Scholar), (b) inhibiting EGFR dimerization, and (c) as suggested here, promoting the association of caveolin-1 and the EGFR. The significance of the increased caveolin-1/EGFR association in GM3-induced inhibition of the EGFR requires further investigation. In untreated and sense oligomer-treated cells, expression of GM3 was limited to the detergent-insoluble membrane domains. Endogenous overexpression of GM3 in the SCC12 cells, however, led to increased GM3 content in both the detergent-soluble and -insoluble membrane regions. Although undoubtedly some of the GM3 seen in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction reflects the observed intracellular accumulation, the specific co-immunoprecipitation from whole cell lysates of GM3 and caveolin-1 with anti-EGFR antibody directed against the extracellular region confirms that endogenous increases in GM3 shift GM3 into the same detergent-soluble membrane domain as the EGFR and the shifted caveolin-1. The movement of GM3 with caveolin-1 into detergent-soluble domains positions GM3, which binds to the EGFR through extracellular interactions (28Wang X.Q. Sun P. O'Gorman M. Tai T. Paller A.S. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 515-522Google Scholar), as a stabilizer of the caveolin-1/EGFR interaction and a facilitator of the inhibitory effect of caveolin-1. The movement of GM3 with caveolin-1 also implies that GM3 may bind directly or indirectly to caveolin-1, transporting it into proximity with the EGFR. However, interactions of other proteins with SCC12 cell gangliosides have involved extracellular carbohydrate-dependent interactions (27Wang X. Sun P. Al-Qamari A. Tai T. Kawashima I. Paller A.S. J.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 515-522Google Scholar), and caveolin-1 is not glycosylated and has no extracellular domain. Direct interaction of GM3 with caveolin-1 would require binding of the transmembrane region of caveolin-1 with the intramembrane sphingolipid moiety of GM3. Alternatively, an indirect interaction of GM3 with caveolin-1 via an adaptor molecule with an extracellular domain is another possibility. The mechanism by which GM3 content affects caveolin-1 transport may also be explained by the recent recognition that the plasma membrane ganglioside-specific sialidase is enriched in caveolar domains in close association with caveolin-1 and binds directly to the caveolin-1 in HeLa cells and COS-1 cells (48Wang Y. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Hata K. Zhao X. Fujimoto T. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26252-26259Google Scholar). Given that GM3 is a substrate for this plasma membrane ganglioside-specific sialidase, the binding of GM3 to this membrane sialidase may compete with caveolin-1 for binding to the sialidase, thus releasing or promoting continued attachment with the caveolin-1 depending on GM3 content. The role of gangliosides as shuttle molecules within the membrane to inhibit growth factor receptor phosphorylation has recently been suggested for ganglioside GM1. Similar to the effect of GM3 on EGFR function, GM1 inhibits phosphorylation (49Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Google Scholar) and dimerization (50Van Brocklyn J. Bremer E.G. Yates A.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 371-374Google Scholar) of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. However, overexpression of GM1 by gene transfection with GM2/GD2 synthase and GM1 synthase cDNAs in Swiss 3T3 cells shifts the platelet-derived growth factor receptor itself from the “glycosphingolipid-enriched domains” of the Triton X-100-insoluble region to the heavier, detergent-soluble “non-glycosphingolipid-enriched domains” domains (51Mitsuda T. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Miyazaki H. Urano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11239-11246Google Scholar) without affecting the distribution of caveolin-1. In contrast, our studies show that GM3 overexpression shifts caveolin-1 into EGFR-rich domains, without affecting the expression or distribution of the EGFR itself. Having shown that GM3 affects caveolin-1 distribution and association with the EGFR, we then evaluated the effect of modulation of ganglioside content on caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Caveolin-1 phosphorylation is stimulated by EGF in A431 cells but not in other cells (20Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Google Scholar). Our studies confirm the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 by EGF in SCC12 cells and implicate GM3 as a cofactor in the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. Of importance, our data with ganglioside depletion strongly suggest that ganglioside is critical for EGF-stimulated caveolin phosphorylation in general, since ganglioside depletion eliminates EGF-stimulated caveolin-1 phosphorylation. The concordance of these results of ganglioside depletion with both sialidase overexpression and PPPP treatment eliminates the possibility that sialidase itself is an inhibitor of EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. Our data also implicate tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 as a means to strengthen the interaction of caveolin-1 with the EGFR and increase the suppressive effect of caveolin-1 on EGFR phosphorylation, given the suppressive effect on EGFR activation of caveolin-1 binding. The role of serine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in signaling is unknown. We found no evidence of serine phosphorylation of the caveolin-1 in association with the immunoprecipitated EGFR at any time, regardless of GM3 content. However, GM3 induced serine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 that is not associated with the EGFR as a late phenomenon after EGF stimulation, concurrent with down-regulation of caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. The role of serine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in EGFR signaling deserves further investigation. In conclusion, we provided evidence for a role of tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 as an inhibitor of EGFR signal transduction outside of caveolar domains and have shown that membrane GM3 content regulates the localization of caveolin-1 relative to the EGFR, possibly facilitating the GM3-modulated caveolin-1-induced receptor inhibition. In addition, ganglioside appears to be a critical co-factor in allowing EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. Finally, the significant activation of serine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 that is dissociated from the EGFR by GM3 overexpression suggests a role for serine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in modulating EGFR signaling."

ARNT is an indispensable partner of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) or hypoxia-inducible factor-1α. This protein is also able to form homodimers such as ARNT/ARNT. However, the molecular mechanism that regulates the transcriptional activity of ARNT remains to be elucidated.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear transporter (ARNT) 1The abbreviations used for: ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear transporter; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; HIF1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; XRE, xenobiotic-responsive element; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; HRE, hypoxia-responsive element; E3, protein isopeptide ligase; NBs, nuclear bodies; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild-type; DBD, DNA-binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein. belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/PAS (Per-ARNT-Sim) family of proteins. These transcription factors are required for cell regulation to respond to various environmental conditions (1Crews S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The bHLH/PAS proteins include the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α). ARNT is an indispensable partner of these proteins for the formation of heterodimers such as AHR/ARNT and HIF1α/ARNT. Both transcription pathways are not only biologically significant, but represent remarkable regulatory mechanisms in vivo. First, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 3-methylcholanthrene are exogenous ligands for AHR and induce the formation of the AHR·ARNT complex (3Rowlands J.C. Gustafsson J. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1997; 27: 109-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligands, AHR is generally found in the cytoplasm in association with hsp90 and other molecules (3Rowlands J.C. Gustafsson J. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1997; 27: 109-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 4Kazlauskas A. Sundström S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Upon the binding of a ligand, AHR is converted to a functional DNA-binding species in a multistep process involving nuclear translocation, dissociation from the hsp90-containing complex, and dimerization with ARNT. The resulting AHR·ARNT complex binds a specific cis-acting regulatory DNA sequence, termed the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE), upstream of its target genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1 and others), quinone reductase, and the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) Ya subunit. Xenobiotic-activated AHR is then degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome system after being exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (5Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in the AHR gene demonstrate dioxin-induced cytotoxicities, including developmental defects and tumorigenesis, depending on the AHR/ARNT pathways (6Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 1194-1198PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shimizu Y. Nakatsuru Y. Ichinose M. Takahashi Y. Kume H. Mimura J. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ishikawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Second, ARNT, also known as HIF1β, forms a HIF1α/ARNT heterodimer in response to oxygen tension in the cells. Under hypoxic conditions, it activates the transcription of a number of target genes whose promoters contain the binding motif termed the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) (8Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). These include genes encoding erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, glycolytic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, and heme oxygenase-1, all of which allow the cells to cope with lower oxygen levels. In addition, HIF1α/ARNT controls the gene expression involved in iron metabolism, pH regulation, cell proliferation and apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. The HIF1α protein is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway under normoxic conditions (9Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4150) Google Scholar, 10Kamura T. Sato S. Iwai K. Czyzyk-Krzeska M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In a hypoxic state, it becomes stable and translocates into the nucleus. It then dimerizes with ARNT to activate transcription. Thus, bHLH/PAS family members have significant features of their regulatory mechanisms, and ARNT is implicated in many signaling pathways mediated by AHR or HIF1α as its partner. Increasing numbers of cellular proteins have been found to be covalently conjugated with SUMO-1 (smallubiquitin-related modifier-1). Sumoylation is thought to control the function of substrate proteins through affecting their interaction with cooperative molecules and subcellular localization (11Müller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 12Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7243-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Wilson V.G. Rangasamy D. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The conjugation by SUMO-1 in some cases antagonizes ubiquitination at the identical target lysine of substrates, resulting in the stabilization of sumoylated proteins (14Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar,15Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Like the ubiquitin conjugation system, SUMO-1 is activated in an ATP-dependent manner by a Sua1/UBA2 heterodimer SUMO-1-activating enzyme); then transferred to a SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme, UBC9; and subsequently attached to the ε-amino group of target lysines of substrates (11Müller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 12Seeler J.S. Dejean A.

Sumoylation mostly targets the consensus sequence ΨKXE, where Ψ and K are a hydrophobic residue and the SUMO-1 acceptor lysine in substrate proteins, respectively (16Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B.

Although it was unknown whether sumoylation requires E3 enzymes with SUMO-1 ligase activities, SUMO E3-like factors have recently been identified in mammals, including members of the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activatedSTAT, where STAT is signaltransducer and activator oftranscription) family of proteins and Ran-binding protein-2 (27Schmidt D.

Furthermore, some sumoylated proteins are found to localize to specified nuclear domains called nuclear bodies (NBs), also referred to as nuclear domain 10 or PML oncogenic domains (29Hong Y.

Proteins such as Sp100 and p53 are similarly modified by SUMO-1, but their translocation into NBs does not need SUMO-1 modifications (16Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 25Kwek S.S. Derry J. Tyner A.L. Shen Z. Gudkov A.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recently, some transcription factors and their co-regulators were identified to associate with PML, emphasizing the transcriptional roles of PML-NBs (37Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 38Hatta M. Fukamizu A. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full.OC sigtrans;2001/96/pel)PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the SUMO-1 conjugation system may cooperate with PML-NBs in transcriptional control. In addition to the heterodimerization with AHR or HIF1α, ARNT is likely to form a homodimer with itself to bind the E-box core sequence CACGTG with high specificity and affinity, suggesting a physiological role of the ARNT·ARNT complex (3Rowlands J.C. Gustafsson J. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1997; 27: 109-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 39Huffman J.L. Mokashi A. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the t(1,12)(q21;p13) translocation of human acute myeloblastic leukemia results in a fusion protein containing the amino-terminal part of TEL (translocated ETS leukemia, also known as ETV6) and almost all of ARNT (40Salomon-Nguyen F. Della-Valle V. Mauchauffe M. Busson-Le Coniat M. Ghysdael J. Berger R. Bernard O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6757-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The activity of ARNT may directly contribute to leukemogenesis. It is therefore of considerable interest to study the function of ARNT and the mechanism that regulates the transcriptional role of this protein. During the investigation of ARNT in cultured mammalian cells, we discovered that ARNT is modified by SUMO-1 chiefly at Lys245 within the PAS domain, which is required for forming the complexes with bHLH/PAS and other molecules (3Rowlands J.C. Gustafsson J. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1997; 27: 109-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 41Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol.

ARNT associated with PML or PML-NBs, and the sumoylation of ARNT inhibited both the ability of ARNT to interact with PML and the positive effect of PML on the transactivation by ARNT. These data suggest the importance of the SUMO-1 conjugation system in modulating ARNT-mediated gene expression. Rabbit anti-ARNT (H-172) and rabbit anti-SUMO-1 (FL-101) polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-GST polyclonal antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), mouse anti-ARNT (G-3) and mouse anti-PML (PG-M3) monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-GMP-1 monoclonal antibodies (SUMO-1, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (M5, Sigma), mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies (PL-14, Medical & Biological Laboratories), and mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used in this study. MCF-7, HeLa, and Hepa-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The full-length cDNA for murine ARNT was PCR-amplified from pBOS-ARNT (43Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and XhoI, cloned into pcDNA3-FLAG, and inserted into the XhoI site of pEGFP-C1. To generate pcDNA3-Gal4-ARNT, the fragment of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was amplified from pcDNA3-Gal4DBD (44Fujita N. Shimotake N. Ohki I. Chiba T. Saya H. Shirakawa M. Nakao M. Mol. Cell.

To generate pcDNA3-FLAG-ARNT K245A/K546A, both pcDNA3-FLAG-ARNT K245A and pcDNA3-FLAG-ARNT K546A were digested with SspI, and the fragment containing FLAG and the region of amino acids 1–395 of ARNT K245A were ligated into predigested pcDNA3-FLAG-ARNT K546A. For plasmids expressing GST-fused ARNT and ARNT K245A (amino acids 145–345), the cDNAs for ARNT and ARNT K245A were amplified primers 5′-TCCTTGGGATCCACTGGCAACACATCTACTGAT-3′ (forward, containing a BamHI site (underlined)) and 5′-GGGAGAAAGCTTTACCTGCAGCCTGCCAATGGC-3′ (reverse, containing a HindIII site (underlined)).

The cDNA for SUMO-1-(1–97) was also cloned into the XbaI site of pCGN-HA. To generate plasmids expressing His6-fused FLAG-SUMO-1, the fragment of FLAG and SUMO-1 was obtained by digesting pcDNA3-FLAG-SUMO-1 withBamHI and HindIII and cloned into pRSET, yielding pRSET-FLAG-SUMO-1.

The PCR fragment was digested with KpnI and XbaI and cloned into pcDNA3-FLAG, resulting in pcDNA3-His-FLAG-SUMO-1. The cDNA for human UBC9 was amplified from HeLa cDNAs and cloned into theXbaI site of pCGN-HA, yielding pCGN-HA-UBC9. For pGL3-promoter-XRE, oligonucleotides containing six XREs (5′-CTAGATGCGTGTGCGTGTGCGTGTGCGTGTGCGTGTGCGTGT-3′ and 5′-CTAGACACGCACACGCACACGCACACGCACACGCACACGCAT-3′) were equally mixed, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and then cooled to room temperature. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were ligated into the NheI site of the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega). For pGL3-basic-mCyp1A1, ∼1.5 kb of the promoter sequence of the mousecyp1A1 gene was amplified from genomic DNA by primers 5′-TCCTGGGGTACCTCACAGAGCAGATATCAATGT-3′ (forward, containing a KpnI site (underlined)) and 5′-TCTAGGAAGCTTGGGAGGATCGGGGAAGCTCCA-3′ (reverse, containing a HindIII site (underlined)).

Cell lysates were prepared with SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 100 mmdithiothreitol). Samples were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters with a constant current of 140 mA for 2 h. The filters were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% skim milk and then incubated with the appropriate antibodies in PBS containing 0.03% Tween 20 for 2 h and washed three times for 7 min with PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20. The filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 40 min, and then specific proteins were detected using the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences). MCF-7 cells (30–50% confluent in six-well plates) were transfected with 1 μg of each of the expression vectors for His6-FLAG-ARNT (wild-type (WT) or K245A) and HA-SUMO-1 per well using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).

Transfected cells in one well were lysed directly with SDS sample buffer as an input sample. All samples were electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by Western blot analysis. Sf9 insect cells expressing both Sua1 and human UBA2 (45Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 3 mmMgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min and used as a source of Sua1/human UBA2. His6-UBC9 and His6-FLAG-SUMO-1-(1–97) were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(SI) and purified by affinity chromatography using ProBond. GST-ARNT WT and GST-ARNT K245A were expressed in BL21(star) and purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). GST-ARNT proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and then incubated with Sua1/human UBA2, UBC9, and ATP with or without His6-FLAG-SUMO-1 at 25 °C for 120 min in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. After the reaction, the beads were washed with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS five times and then boiled in SDS sample buffer. MCF-7 cells were plated at a density of 6∼8 × 105 cells/ml in a six-well plate and cultured for 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were introduced with 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV (Promega), which was used for monitoring the transfection efficiency, together with the indicated expression plasmids by TransFast (Promega). The transfected cells were treated with 10 μm 3-methylcholanthrene (Aldrich) and 200 μm cobalt chloride (Wako Bioproducts) or solvent alone for 12 h during the incubation. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in the lysis buffer provided by the manufacturer (Promega). The insertless pcDNA3 was used as a mock vector. The luciferase activities were determined with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Values are the means ± S.D. of the results from at least three independent experiments. For Gal4 transactivation studies, 1 μg of Gal4-ARNT (WT or K245A) or the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) vector, 0.5 μg of the pG5luc reporter vector, and 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV were introduced into the cells in each well using TransFast. pCGN-HA-SUMO-1 (the indicated amount), pCGN-HA-UBC9 (1 μg), and pcDNA3-Myc-PML (1 μg) were cotransfected, and luciferase analysis was done at 48 h after transfection. For immunofluorescence analysis, MCF-7 and Hepa-1 cells were transfected with the indicated vectors using FuGENE 6. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with specific primary antibodies at room temperature for 60 min. The samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (BIOSOURCE)- or Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60 min and visualized with an Olympus confocal laser scanning microscope. To avoid bleed-through effects in the double-staining experiments, each dye was independently excited, and images were electronically merged. MCF-7 or HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids with FuGENE 6 and lysed at 48 h after transfection with hypotonic buffer (10 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 100 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.5 μm pepstatin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) on ice for 30 min. After brief sonication and centrifugation (13,000 rpm) for 20 min, the supernatants were incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h and then with protein A/G beads (Calbiochem) at 4 °C for 2 h. For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins, anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) was used. The beads were washed five times with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The immunoprecipitates were suspended in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The pcDNA3-FLAG-ARNT or mock vector was transfected into MCF-7 cells with or without pCGN-HA-SUMO-1 and pCGN-HA-UBC9 using FuGENE 6. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed with binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 nm MgCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol), briefly sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatants were incubated with GST-PML or GST at 4 °C for 2 h. 25 μl of glutathione-agarose beads as a 50% slurry in binding buffer was added to the mixture. After incubation at 4 °C for"
https://openalex.org/W1969538018,"The crystal structure of the high molecular mass cytochrome c HmcA from Desulfovibrio vulgarisHildenborough is described. HmcA contains the unprecedented number of sixteen hemes c attached to a single polypeptide chain, is associated with a membrane-bound redox complex, and is involved in electron transfer from the periplasmic oxidation of hydrogen to the cytoplasmic reduction of sulfate. The structure of HmcA is organized into four tetraheme cytochrome c 3-like domains, of which the first is incomplete and contains only three hemes, and the final two show great similarity to the nine-heme cytochromec from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. An isoleucine residue fills the vacant coordination space above the iron atom in the five-coordinated high-spin Heme 15. The characteristics of each of the tetraheme domains of HmcA, as well as its surface charge distribution, indicate this cytochrome has several similarities with the nine-heme cytochrome c and the Type II cytochromec 3 molecules, in agreement with their similar genetic organization and mode of reactivity and further support an analogous physiological function for the three cytochromes. Based on the present structure, the possible electron transfer sites between HmcA and its redox partners (namely Type I cytochromec 3 and other proteins of the Hmc complex), as well as its physiological role, are discussed.

The product of this respiration, sulfide, is highly toxic and corrosive and is responsible for the environmental, economic, and health impact of these bacteria in their habitats: soil, still and freshwaters, seawater, the human (and other animal) colon, and oil fields and pipelines (1Hamilton W.A. Biodegradation. 1998; 9: 201-212Google Scholar, 2Loubinoux J. Bronowicki J.P. Pereira I.A.C. Mougenel J.L. Le Faou A.E. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 2002; 1341: 1-6Google Scholar). The sulfate respiratory chain is still one of the least understood anaerobic respiration processes. One of its peculiarities is that the terminal reductases responsible for reduction of sulfate are all cytoplasmic and thus do not contribute directly to creation of a proton gradient across the membrane. Hydrogen seems to be an important component in the metabolism of SRB. It can be used as the sole energy source by several bacteria (3Brandis A. Thauer R.K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 126: 249-252Google Scholar), and it is formed during growth in the absence of sulfate (4Postgate J.R. The Sulphate Reducing Bacteria. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, United Kingdom1984: 56-100Google Scholar). Hydrogen is also transiently produced and then consumed during growth on organic compounds in the presence of sulfate (5Tsuji K. Yagi T. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 125: 35-42Google Scholar, 6Traore A.S. Hatchikian C.E. Bélaich J.P. LeGall J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 154: 101-109Google Scholar). It has been proposed that energy conservation in SRB involves H2 as an intermediate, which is formed in the cytoplasm as a result of oxidative metabolism, and diffuses to the periplasm where its reoxidation generates electrons that are shuttled across the membrane for the reduction of sulfate, leaving protons in the periplasm to activate the ATP synthase (7Odom J.M. Peck Jr., H.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1981; 12: 47-50Google Scholar,8Louro R.O. Catarino T. Turner D.L. Piçarra-Pereira M.A. Pacheco I. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15808-15815Google Scholar). Desulfovibrio is the best studied genus of SRB. The bacteria of this genus are characterized by having an unusual number of periplasmic multiheme cytochromes, of which the most abundant and widespread is the well characterized tetraheme Type I cytochromec 3 (TpI-c3) (9Louro R.O.

Other examples include the sixteen-heme high molecular mass cytochrome c (HmcA) (10Higuchi Y. Inaka K. Yasuoka N. Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 341-348Google Scholar, 11Brent W.

It was isolated as a soluble protein fromDesulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) (10Higuchi Y. Inaka K. Yasuoka N. Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 341-348Google Scholar,11Brent W.

Chem. 1997; 2: 23-31Google Scholar). The gene for HmcA was cloned in DvH, and it was found to be part of a large operon (the hmc operon) encoding a putative membrane-bound redox complex of six proteins, HmcA–HmcF (21Rossi M. Pollock W.B.R. Reij M.W. Keon R.G. Fu R. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4699-4711Google Scholar). HmcA is a hydrophilic cytochrome with no transmembrane helices and contains a signal peptide indicating that it is periplasmic; HmcB is a putative 40.1-kDa transmembrane protein having a periplasmic hydrophilic N-terminal domain with four Fe4S4 cluster binding motifs and a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (22Keon R.G. Voordouw G. Anaerobe. 1996; 2: 231Google Scholar); HmcC (43.2 kDa), HmcD (5.8 kDa), and HmcE (25.3 kDa) are all predicted to be integral membrane proteins, of which HmcC and HmcE may bind hemes b, and HmcF is predicted to be a 52.7-kDa membrane-associated cytoplasmic protein having two Fe4S4 cluster binding motifs. The Hmc complex has been proposed to constitute the missing link between periplasmic hydrogen oxidation and cytoplasmic sulfate reduction (21Rossi M. Pollock W.B.R. Reij M.W. Keon R.G. Fu R. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4699-4711Google Scholar), accepting electrons from the hydrogenases via the TpI-c3 and transferring them across the membrane to the cytoplasm for reduction of sulfate. This role of the Hmc complex is corroborated by growth and expression studies with wild type and mutant strains of SRB (23Keon R.G. Fu R. Voordouw G. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 376-383Google Scholar, 24Dolla A. Pohorelic B.K.J. Voordouw J.K. Voordouw G. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 143-151Google Scholar, 25Steger J.L. Vincent C. Ballard J.D. Krumholz L.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 1932-1937Google Scholar) and by electron transfer experiments (26Pereira I.A.C. Romão C.V. Xavier A.V. LeGall J. Teixeira M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 494-498Google Scholar). HmcA is the cytochrome with the highest number of hemes in a single polypeptide, known so far. It is the largest in the family of periplasmic Desulfovibrio cytochromes and was the only one, until now, for which no structure was available. In this report we describe the crystal structure of the DvH HmcA and analyze the implications of this structure in terms of the physiological role of this cytochrome in the sulfate respiratory pathway. Cells were grown, and the 16-heme HmcA cytochrome was purified following the protocol previously described (14Pereira I.A.C. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 23-31Google Scholar). The purity of the protein solution was checked by SDS-PAGE. Crystallization conditions were screened using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, but larger crystals could only be obtained using the dialysis method. The composition of the crystallization solution was: 40% 2-propanol (v/v), 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The addition of several additives (e.g. 2-methyl-2,4-pentanodiol (MPD), ethanol, dioxane, and detergents) to this crystallization solution did not seem to improve the crystal quality. Each crystallization assay was prepared by adding 5 μl of the protein solution (10 mg.ml−1) to a dialysis button, which was then completely soaked in the crystallization solution. After a few days at 4 °C small hexagonal bipyramids started to appear and reached their maximum size after 1 week. The best cryocrystallography conditions were obtained by soaking these crystals in a crystallization solution containing 7.5% MPD. The diffraction pattern from HmcA crystals indicated that they belong to one of the hexagonal space groups P62 or P64, with cell constants a = 220.39, c = 102.64 Å at 100 K. The presence of four molecules in the asymmetric unit was suggested byV m considerations (27Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Google Scholar), resulting in a solvent content of about 60%. Crystals of HmcA were pre-frozen at ITQB and shipped frozen to the ESRF in Grenoble, France, where a three-wavelength MAD experiment was carried out at beamline ID-29. Two of the energies (peak and inflection point) were chosen by inspection of an x-ray fluorescence spectrum from a crystal, taken near the K-absorption edge of iron. A third energy (remote) was chosen as 13.51 KeV. The experiment was designed to obtain a three-wavelength MAD data set about 80% complete (in terms of Bijvoet pairs) to 3.0 Å. This non-optimal strategy was caused by the observation that, because even the best crystals showed clear evidence of crystal multiplicity, only a relatively small oscillation range could provide usable diffraction data. Notwithstanding, and in view of the relatively high iron content of this protein, it was thought that this data set would be sufficient to solve the HmcA structure. Additionally, a very fine beam size (30 × 30 μm) combined with a fine φ-slicing (0.25°) were used to minimize spatial overlap between the diffraction spots, and, to minimize the chances of radiation damage as well as the number of saturated reflections on the diffracted images, the incident beam intensity was greatly reduced by reducing the primary horizontal guard to 0.25 mm. The ADSC-Q4R detector on ID-29 was used to record the diffraction images, which were processed using the HKL suite (DENZO/SCALEPACK) (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

ScalingR factor (F) = Σhkl‖Fλi − Fλ3‖/ΣhklFλ3. Although the values for R anom were not significantly higher than R merge for the data collected at the peak point of inflection wavelengths, the presence of anomalous signal at these wavelengths was made clear by the “compareano” protocol in SCALEPACK. Respectively, overall χ2 values of 5.5 and 2.7 were observed, when comparing the mean diffraction intensities of the two members of each complete Bijvoet pair, following χ2 value adjustment to near unity in successive scaling, merging, and outlier rejecting rounds where they were treated as separate reflections. The scaled and merged data for the three wavelengths were then converted to CCP4 format (29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) for further processing and analysis. The program SCALEIT was used to scale together the three data sets, using the remote as reference. Patterson maps were calculated using as coefficients the anomalous differences for the peak and point of inflection wavelengths, as well as the dispersive differences between the remote and point of inflection wavelengths. In these maps, many strong peaks could be seen in thew = 0 section, the largest feature being located at about (0,1/2) (1/2,0) and (1/2,1/2) in the (u,v) plane. This was interpreted as being the result of a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) axis parallel to the 6-fold crystallographic axis. 64 iron atoms from the 16 heme groups in each of the 4 independent molecules were expected in the asymmetric unit, and this large number of anomalous scatterers recommended a direct method approach using the Shake & Bake protocol (30Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Google Scholar) to determine their positions. Using the peak wavelength data and 1000 sets of randomly generated atoms in space group P62, the resulting R minhistogram clearly showed a bi-modal distribution, an indication of a correct (albeit partial) determination of the iron sub-structure in the HmcA crystal structure. The same procedure was carried out in space group P64 and failed to produce a similar distribution of the R min histogram. This was interpreted as the resolution of the space group ambiguity in favor of P62. To minimize the chances of introducing spurious peaks in the MAD phasing procedure, only the top 32 sites were used to begin phase refinement calculations with MLPHARE (31Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1991: 80-86Google Scholar). Dispersive difference Fourier maps, calculated using MLPHARE phases and difference amplitudes between the remote and point of inflection data sets as coefficients, were used to locate additional iron sites, which were then added to the phase calculation and refinement procedure. These maps were found to be in this case more useful than Fourier maps calculated with MLPHARE phases (retarded by 90°) and the peak wavelength anomalous differences as coefficients, because more peaks were observed and a clearer distinction between true and spurious peaks could be achieved. In this way, all 64 iron sites in the asymmetric unit were located and included in the MLPHARE phase refinement procedure, which at convergence gave phases to 2.8 Å with an overall figure of merit of 0.589. These phases were further improved to 〈m〉 = 0.699 up to 2.5-Å resolution with DM (32Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsl. Protein Crystallogr. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) using phase extension, histogram matching, solvent flattening, and NCS averaging protocols. Using these 64 sites, a phasing and density modification procedure using SOLVE (33Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar) and RESOLVE (34Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Google Scholar) was also carried out resulting in a final overall figure of merit of 0.684 up to 2.5-Å resolution. Electron density maps calculated at 2.5-Å resolution using phases from both procedures were used to build an initial model for the HmcA molecule with programs O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar) and TURBO-Frodo (36Roussel A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. XV International Union of Crystallography Congress Abstracts. Bordeaux, France1990: 66-67Google Scholar). The main statistics of the phasing process are listed in Table I. A nearly perfect 4-fold NCS was assumed for the asymmetric unit of the HmcA crystal structure; therefore, the initial model of the HmcA molecule was built for only one of the four independent molecules and the coordinates for the other three molecules were then obtained from those of the first by applying the appropriate NCS operations, derived from the positions of the 16 iron atoms in each molecule. We adopted a residue-numbering scheme based on the full protein sequence (including the signal peptide) (21Rossi M. Pollock W.B.R. Reij M.W. Keon R.G. Fu R. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4699-4711Google Scholar), and therefore the mature protein begins at residue 32. The structure was refined using X-PLOR (37Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1: a System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). In all refinement stages and map calculations, a bulk solvent correction was used, and all low resolution data were included. Prior to the refinement calculations, a random 5% sample of the reflection data was flagged for R free calculations (38Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Google Scholar). All model interactive visualization and editing was carried out using TURBO-Frodo (36Roussel A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. XV International Union of Crystallography Congress Abstracts. Bordeaux, France1990: 66-67Google Scholar). Data up to 2.5 Å and 4-fold NCS restraints were used in the initial refinement. This refinement converged to R andR free values of 22.7% and 30.3%, respectively. The use of 2-fold NCS restraints did not improve these values significantly; therefore, at this point, a 2.5-Å refinement without any imposed NCS restraints was carried out. In addition to the 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ and ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ electron density maps calculated with X-PLOR, 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ electron density maps were obtained by applying the fast ARP/wARP (39Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Google Scholar, 40Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Google Scholar) molecular replacement protocol to the X-PLOR refinement results, and ‖F o‖ ςA maps (41Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Google Scholar) were computed by phase recombination of the original SOLVE phases with the model phases from X-PLOR (downweighted by 0.816). Careful inspection of these maps revealed a breakdown of the assumed NCS, in particular for two clearly defined regions in each molecule: residues 282–290, and neighboring 389–397, due to different crystal packing environments. The four molecules were rebuilt taking these differences into account, and further refinement with X-PLOR, without any imposed NCS restraints, resulted in a marked decrease inR free (from 30.3% to 28.7%). The final refinements were carried out with REFMAC (42Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) using TLS (43Schomaker V. Trueblood K.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1968; 24: 63-76Google Scholar) rigid body refinement prior to restrained refinement of atomic positions and thermal motion parameters. For each independent molecule in the asymmetric unit, three rigid bodies were defined, corresponding to the three major structural domains (see “Discussion”): triheme cytochrome c 3, tetraheme cytochromec 3, and nine-heme cytochrome c. In the final refinement, 497 water molecules were included in the model, and individual restrained B-factors were refined for all non-hydrogen atoms. The final values of R andR free were 19.2% and 25.8%, respectively. In each of the four independent HmcA molecules there were some regions where the electron density was either unclear or missing, and therefore some atoms were given zero occupancy in the refinement. In some cases, whole residues had to be left out of the model.

Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar) with Protein Data Bank accession codes 1h29 and r1h29sf, respectively. The 16-heme HmcA crystallizes as a dimer, there being two such dimers in the asymmetric unit. The molecules in each dimer are related (with the exceptions noted above) by a 2-fold NCS axis parallel to the crystallographic 62 screw axis. There are also 2-fold NCS axes as well as pure translations relating the two independent dimers. The combination of these crystallographic and NCS elements results in very strong peaks being observed in both native, anomalous and dispersive Patterson maps and also in strong 2-fold NCS axes perpendicular to the crystallographic 62screw axis, observed in self-rotation Patterson maps. The dimerization results from two specific intermolecular interactions: Asp-132 Oδ2 and Glu-134 Oε2 in the first monomer, respectively, form a hydrogen bond (2.9 Å) with His-516 Nδ1 and an electrostatic interaction (3.0 Å) with Asn-533 Nδ2 in the second monomer, and vice versa. His-516 is one of the heme 16 axial ligands, whereas Asn-533 Nδ2 already has an intramolecular hydrogen bond to Asp-524 Oδ1. Only 3% of the total molecular surface of each monomer, i.e. 850 Å2 in 27780 Å2, calculated with AREAIMOL (29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) are buried by the dimerization process. The R free/Rratio of 1.34 is within the expected range for the number of atoms, refined parameters, and reflections used in the 2.5-Å resolution refinement (45Tickle I.J. Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 547-557Google Scholar). The TLS refinement with REFMAC lowered bothR and R free (0.192 and 0.258), in comparison with X-PLOR (0.203, 0.290) and REFMAC (0.205, 0.279) refinements without TLS. Curiously, the TLS refinement gave rise to higher B-values for the protein than had been obtained with the X-PLOR and REFMAC refinements without TLS. The anisotropic thermal motion parameters derived from the REFMAC TLS refinement with TLSANL (29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) are represented in Fig. 1, and it can be seen that, within the limitations of the data resolution and of the TLS rigid group definition used, the protein regions with highest and most anisotropic B-values are located, as expected, in loop regions exposed to the solvent. Interestingly, the polypeptide segment connecting the top and bottom of the nine-heme region of HmcA also exhibits high thermal motion parameters, an indication of its flexibility. The four independent HmcA molecules in the crystal structure were analyzed with PROCHECK (46Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar), and their stereochemical quality parameters were within their respective confidence intervals. In the Ramachandran (47Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Google Scholar) ϕ,φ plot, between 83.5% and 85.7% of the residues lie within the most favored regions, and there are only three residues (Asp-212 and Ala-395 in molecule A, Ala-390 in molecule B) that are marginally inside the disallowed regions. A few (between 1 and 5) close contacts (2.5–2.6 Å) were reported by PROCHECK. All molecules were assigned to class (1 2 2) (48Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Google Scholar), and their overallG-factors ranged between −0.02 and −0.07.

The functional significance of MBD3 in the NuRD complex remains enigmatic, partly because of the limited availability of biochemical approaches, such as immunoprecipitation, to analyze MBD3. In this study, we stably expressed the FLAG-tagged version of MBD3 in HeLa cells. We found that MBD3-FLAG was incorporated into the NuRD complex, and the MBD3-FLAG-containing NuRD complex was efficiently immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibodies. By exploiting this system, we found that MBD3 is phosphorylated in vivo in the late G2and early M phases. Moreover, we found that Aurora-A, a serine/threonine kinase active specifically in the late G2and early M phases, phosphorylates MBD3 in vitro, physically associates with MBD3 in vivo, and co-localizes with MBD3 at the centrosomes in the early M phase. Interestingly, HDAC1 is distributed at the centrosomes in a manner similar to MBD3. These results suggest the highly dynamic nature of the temporal and spatial distributions, as well as the biochemical modification, of the NuRD complex in M phase, probably through an interaction with kinases, including Aurora-A. These observations will contribute significantly to the elucidation of the yet-uncharacterized cell cycle-controlled functions of the NuRD complex.

Core histones are subjected to a variety of post-translational modifications, including acetylation and methylation (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Google Scholar). These modifications affect the chromatin structure and/or the accessibility of transcriptional regulatory factors to chromatin and thereby influence gene expression. Acetylation has been the most extensively investigated among them. Generally, hyperacetylated histones are correlated with the transcriptionally active state, whereas hypoacetylated histones are correlated with the silent state (reviewed in Ref. 2Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Google Scholar). The relative level of histone acetylation is determined by the equilibrium between two opposite enzymatic activities, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferases; HDAC, histone deacetylase; mCpG, methyl-CpG; MBD, mCpG-binding domain; NMI, normal mouse IgG; PI, propidium iodide; HA, hemagglutinin A; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250; IF, immunofluorescence; TSA, trichostatin A. 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferases; HDAC, histone deacetylase; mCpG, methyl-CpG; MBD, mCpG-binding domain; NMI, normal mouse IgG; PI, propidium iodide; HA, hemagglutinin A; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250; IF, immunofluorescence; TSA, trichostatin A.and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Each of the HAT and HDAC groups comprises a protein family consisting of many member proteins. These proteins do not function by themselves. Instead, they form large multiprotein complexes together with other components, such as DNA/chromatin-binding proteins and co-activator/co-repressor, as well as other rather ill-defined proteins. Among the members of the HDAC family, HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 comprise one subgroup (Class I HDACs) because of their homology to yeast HDAC Rpd3. HDAC1 and HDAC2 are present as two major complexes, namely, NuRD and SIN3 (reviewed in Ref.3Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Google Scholar). These two HDAC complexes share some components, including HDAC1 and HDAC2, and contain specific components. NuRD is unique in that it possesses another catalytic activity, the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling activity performed by Mi2. The acetylation of histones is not a stationary process. Instead, it is known that the general levels of acetylated histones and the relative activities of HATs and HDACs vary in a regulated manner during cell cycle progression (4Lusser A. Brosch G. Lopez-Rodas G. Loidl P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 102-110Google Scholar, 5Weiss G. Puschendorf B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 205-210Google Scholar). These cell cycle-dependent changes of the histone acetylation levels are believed to participate in controlling the progression of cell cycle by regulating the expression of genes required for cell cycle progression and directly modifying the structures and functions of chromosomes and their functional components, such as kinetochores. Little is known, however, regarding how the cell cycle progression and the cell-cycle-regulated HAT and HDAC activities are linked. Gene activities are also modified by DNA methylation, the covalent modification of cytosine in the context of the CpG nucleotide. DNA methylation is generally coupled with gene repression. Importantly, DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are cooperatively involved in transcriptional repression (6Cameron E.E. Bachman K.E. Myohanen S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 103-107Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that methyl-CpG (mCpG)-binding proteins play a major role in mCpG-dependent gene repression (7Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Google Scholar). To date, five mCpG-binding proteins, MBD1–4 and MeCP2, have been identified in mammals and are collectively called MBD family proteins, because they share the methyl CpG-binding domain (MBD). Among them, MBD1, MBD2, and MeCP2 have been well characterized for their gene-repressing activities. These proteins bind to mCpG through MBD and recruit HDAC through another domain called the transcriptional repression domain. MBD4 is a DNA repair enzyme specific to T/G mismatched base pairs (8Bellacosa A. Cicchillitti L. Schepis F. Riccio A. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Golemis E.A. Genuardi M. Neri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3969-3974Google Scholar,9Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Google Scholar). In contrast to these well-characterized MBD proteins, the function of MBD3 is not fully understood. Although MBD2 and MBD3 are highly homologous in and outside MBD, experiments performed in vitro and in vivo failed to demonstrate the mCpG-binding activity of recombinant mouse and human MBD3 (10Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Google Scholar, 11Saito M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35434-35439Google Scholar). Controversially, Xenopus MBD3 was demonstrated to possess mCpG-binding activity (12Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Google Scholar). Recent studies have pointed out that amino acids in MBDs critical for binding to mCpG are present inXenopus MBD3 but not in mammalian MBD3 (13Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6653-6661Google Scholar, 14Wakefield R.I. Smith B.O. Nan X. Free A. Soteriou A. Uhrin D. Bird A.P. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1055-1065Google Scholar). These amino acid substitutions are responsible for the inability of mammalian MBD3 to bind to mCpG (11Saito M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35434-35439Google Scholar). It was reported that the NuRD complex contains MBD3 as a component (15Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Google Scholar). However, the role of MBD3 in the NuRD complex remains unclear. Other components of the NuRD complex include HDAC1, HDAC2, Mi2, RbAp46, RbAp48, and MTA-2 (12Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Google Scholar, 17Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Vermaak D. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 843-846Google Scholar). It was shown that the human NuRD complex does not bind to mCpG but is recruited to mCpG by interacting with the authentic mCpG-binding protein MBD2 (16Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Google Scholar,18Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized the biochemical and cytological behaviors of MBD3. We found that MBD3 physically binds with and is phosphorylated in vitro by Aurora-A. Aurora-A is a recently identified serine/threonine kinase, which is active in the late G2 and early M phases and localizes to the centrosome and spindle (reviewed in Refs. 19Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 454-459Google Scholar and 20Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Google Scholar). The inactivation or lack of Aurora-A leads to the failure of centrosome separation and the formation of monopolar spindles (21Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Google Scholar, 22Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Doree M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Google Scholar, 23Schumacher J.M. Ashcroft N. Donovan P.J. Golden A. Development. 1998; 125: 4391-4402Google Scholar). Therefore, Aurora-A has been implicated in mitotic regulation. Moreover, we found that a fraction of MBD3 and HDAC1 are co-localized at the Aurora-A-positive centrosomes in early M phase. These results suggest that the NuRD complex is spatially and biochemically regulated in M phase. The cDNA of MBD3 was isolated and the mammalian expression vector of HA-tagged MBD3 was constructed as described previously (24Tatematsu K.I. Yamazaki T. Ishikawa F. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 677-688Google Scholar). pMX-puro, which is a puromycin-resistant derivative of pMX-neo, was used to construct a retroviral expression vector (25Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Google Scholar). The cDNA coding MBD3 with a FLAG epitope was inserted into the pMX-puro (referred to as pMXpuro-MBD3-FLAG). For the preparation of a bacterial expression vector, the cDNA encoding MBD3 with an HA epitope was inserted into pGEX5X-1 (AmershamBiosciences, referred to as pGEX5X-1-HA-MBD3) or pET32c (Novagen). The former plasmid was digested by EcoRI and XhoI to construct another expression vector for only the HA epitope fused with GST. The resulting 3′-terminal ends were filled in by Klenow fragment (Takara) and ligated using a DNA ligation kit (Takara). Plasmids for point mutants of MBD3 were generated with a GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). Products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mammalian and bacterial expression vectors for Aurora-A have been described elsewhere (26Honda K. Mihara H. Kato Y. Yamaguchi A. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Furukawa K. Urano T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2812-2819Google Scholar). Anti-MBD3 antibodies were raised in rabbit against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 252–266 of human MBD3 and further purified by affinity chromatography. Anti-Glu monoclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Larry A. Feig (Tufts University, Boston, MA). Other antibodies used in this study were as follows: mouse monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG (Sigma), normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal anti-Mi2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal anti-MTA1-L1 (MTA2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-HDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-HDAC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal anti-RbAp48 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal anti-RbAp46 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal HA.11 anti-HA (Sigma), goat polyclonal anti-MBD3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse monoclonal anti-IAK1 (Aurora-A) (BD Biosciences). A cell line stably expressing MBD3 was constructed with a retrovirus-mediated system (25Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Google Scholar). In brief, transfection of NX packaging cells with pMXpuro or pMXpuro-MBD3-FLAG was performed with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Retroviruses in the culture supernatants were used to infect HeLa cells. Transfected cells were selected in the presence of 1.0 μg/ml puromycin (referred to as HeLa-puro and HeLa-MBD3-FLAG, respectively). For analysis of the interaction between ectopic FLAG-tagged MBD3 and other components of the NuRD complex, HeLa-MBD3-FLAG cells were lysed using modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm sodium fluoride, and 25 mm β-glycerophosphate). Protein extracts were pretreated with normal mouse IgG (NMI) followed by a mixture of protein G-Sepharose and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The precleared extracts were then treated with anti-FLAG antibodies or NMI. The immunocomplexes were collected with mixture of protein G-Sepharose and protein A-Sepharose and subjected to immunoblot analysis. In brief, samples were resolved by 6 or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore) sheets. The blots were incubated in Block-Ace (Dai Nippon Pharmaceuticals) solution and then probed with primary antibodies. After rinsing with in TnT buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.14 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), the blots were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). After a second rinse in TnT buffer, immunocomplexes were visualized using ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa-MBD3-FLAG cells were synchronized at G1/S boundary according to the thymidine/aphidicolin double-block protocol and released for various lengths of time as described previously (27Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M. Slamon D.J. Plowman G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3052-3065Google Scholar). To obtain samples in M phase, one sample was released from the block and cultured for 6.5 h, followed by an additional culture for 4 h in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml nocodazole. In 32P-metabolic labeling experiments, cells were incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with [32P]orthophosphate to a final concentration of 0.5 mCi/ml for 90 min prior to harvesting. Cells were lysed using the modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Protein extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation experiments with NMI or anti-FLAG antibodies, and immunocomplexes were resolved by parallel 10% SDS-PAGE. One gel was dried and analyzed by BAS2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film). Another gel was subjected to immunoblot analysis as above, except that visualization was performed using a POD Immunostain kit (Wako). Cells were cultured on coverslips and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with 0.2% Tween 20, these antibodies were detected by appropriate secondary antibodies as follows: Alexia 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig antibodies (Molecular Probes), Alexia 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat Ig antibodies (Molecular Probes), Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ig antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). DNA was stained with propidium iodide (Nacalai Tesque) or TOTO3 (Molecular Probes). Images of fluorescent staining were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss). For analysis of the interaction between MBD3 and Aurora-A, COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences). These cells were transfected with the plasmid for HA-tagged MBD3 and Glu-tagged Aurora-A, independently or simultaneously using the DEAE-dextran method. For transient overexpression of MBD3 wild-type or mutant, HeLa cells were maintained in the same medium as above. These cells were transfected with the plasmid for HA-tagged MBD3 wild-type or mutant using LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen). Recombinant proteins of Aurora-A, GST-HA-MBD3, GST-HA, 6xHis-HA-MBD3 wild-type, and mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Reaction mixtures containing substrates, enzymes, 0.1 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in reaction buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1-fold Complete, and 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by CBB staining. The gels were dried and analyzed with the BAS2000 imaging analyzer. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described (28Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar). In brief,in vitro labeled sample was resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. After CBB staining, phosphorylated MBD3 was excised and digested with 0.05 mg/ml trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.4, for 24 h at 37 °C. The digested peptides were lyophilized, dissolved in electrophoresis buffer (acetic acid:formic acid:H2O, 15:5:80, v/v) and spotted onto a silica gel thin-layer plate (Merck). Electrophoresis was performed at 1 kV for 60 min. After drying, ascending chromatography was performed in buffer (isobutyric acid:pyridine:acetic acid:n-butanol:H2O, 1251:96:38:557, v/v). The plate was dried, and phosphopeptides were detected with the BAS2000 imaging analyzer. In vitro labeled sample was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. After staining with CBB, phosphorylated MBD3 was excised and incubated in 6 n HCl. Acid hydrolysis was performed for 90 min at 110 °C. After lyophilization, the hydrolysates were dissolved in a marker mixture containing phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (Sigma). The sample was subjected to electrophoresis on a silica gel thin-layer plate at 1 kV for 60 min in the electrophoresis buffer (acetic acid:pyridine:H2O, 50:5:945, v/v). The markers were stained with 0.25% ninhydrin, and phosphoamino acids were detected with the BAS2000 imaging analyzer. It was previously reported that anti-MBD3 antibodies did not immunoprecipitate the NuRD complex, presumably because MBD3 is buried in the complex and is not accessible to antibodies (16Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Google Scholar). We also experienced the inability of anti-MBD3 antibodies raised in our laboratory to immunoprecipitate MBD3. We reasoned that tagged versions of MBD3 might be recognized by anti-tag antibodies presumably because the tag might be extended from and exposed to the outside of the complex. We therefore constructed a subline of HeLa cells (HeLa-MBD3-FLAG) that stably express the C-terminally FLAG-tagged human MBD3 protein. Two versions of MBD3, MBD3a and MBD3b, are known to be produced by alternative splicing (16Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Google Scholar). In this study, MBD3a, the longer version, is used throughout and will be called simply MBD3 hereafter. In an immunoblot experiment (Fig. 1A), anti-MBD3 antibodies recognized a slower migrating band (closed arrowhead) in HeLa-MBD3-FLAG cell extracts but not in the mock-transfected cell (HeLa-puro) extracts, in addition to a faster migrating band (open arrowhead) that was also found in HeLa-puro extracts. The slower migrating band was reactive with anti-FLAG antibodies, indicating that it represents the C-terminally FLAG-tagged MBD3 recombinant protein. Accordingly, the faster migrating band is the endogenous MBD3 protein. It has been shown that MBD3 is a component of the NuRD complex (15Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Google Scholar,16Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Google Scholar). We examined whether MBD3-FLAG functions as a component in the NuRD complex or not. The protein complex containing MBD3-FLAG was immunoprecipitated from HeLa-MBD3-FLAG extracts using anti-FLAG antibodies. In immunoblot experiments using specific antibodies, we recognized the presence of Mi2, MTA2, HDAC1, and HDAC2 (Fig. 1B) and RbAp48 and RbAp46 (data not shown) in the immunoprecipitates. These results indicate that the MBD3-FLAG protein constitutes the NuRD complex and is successfully immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibodies. The abundance of native MBD3 does not change significantly during the cell cycle (data not shown). To investigate the possibility that the MBD3 function is controlled by post-translational mechanisms, we analyzed whether MBD3 was phosphorylated during the cell cycle. HeLa-MBD3-FLAG cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary using the thymidine/aphidicolin double-block protocol. The cells were released and harvested at various intervals. Prior to each harvest, the cells were cultured for 90 min in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. A parallel culture was used for determining the stage in cell cycle by FACScan and fluorescence microscopy. MBD3-FLAG was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibodies from cell extracts, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and examined by autoradiography and immunoblot experiments (Fig. 2, A and B). The control lanes for the samples of 12-h post-release and nocodazole-arrested cells showed a high background. These samples were derived from metaphase-rich populations (see below), and it is likely that the high background was due to the relatively higher total kinase activities in metaphase. Specific 32P-labeling efficiency of MBD3-FLAG was calculated as (signals in autoradiography)/(signals in immunoblot). The results showed that MBD3-FLAG was significantly phosphorylated at 8, 10, 12, and 14 h and peaked at 10 h, after the release of the block (Fig. 2C). It was also highly phosphorylated in nocodazole-arrested cells. FACScan analysis (Fig. 2D) and DNA staining (Fig. 2E) revealed that the cells at 8–12 h consisted of the G2 and M phase cells. Because the cells at 12 h, which consisted of the largest number of metaphase cells (cells in metaphase = 38.8%, n= 1000), showed a lower labeling efficiency than cells at 10 h (cells in metaphase = 0.4%, n = 1000), it was suggested that the phosphorylation predominantly occurred at the late G2 or early M phase. It should be noted, however, that a significant level of MBD3 phosphorylation was observed at 6-h post-release. It is possible that the MBD3 phosphorylation is not tightly regulated by the cell cycle or, alternatively, that both cell-cycle-dependent and -independent kinases are involved in phosphorylating MBD3. We also found that MTA2, which was immunoprecipitated together with MBD3-FLAG by anti-FLAG antibodies, was phosphorylated in similar kinetics to that of MBD3-FLAG (data not shown). The results described above suggested that MBD3 might be phosphorylated by protein kinases active in the early M phase. To know the potential consequence of this mitotic phosphorylation, we first examined the mitotic localization of endogenous MBD3 using specific antibodies in HeLa cells (which did not produce the MBD3-FLAG protein). In the interphase, MBD3 distributed as numerous fine dots in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). These dot-like structures did not overlap with the centrosomes revealed by anti-γ-tubulin antibodies. However, when cells entered M phase, a fraction of MBD3 signals overlapped with the γ-tubulin signals at the centrosomes. MBD3 at the centrosomes was not evident when the two centrosomes had not migrated to opposite poles in prophase (Fig. 3B) but became evident when the centrosomes occupied the opposite poles in prometaphase (Fig. 3C). This centrosome-associated MBD3 was observed in metaphase (Fig. 3D) and early anaphase (Fig. 3E). However, it was noted that the MBD3 signals at the centrosomes in anaphase were much weaker than those in the earlier M phase, and MBD3 accumulated at the mid zone of spindles in this stage (Fig. 3E). The above results indicate that the kinetics of MBD3 phosphorylation was well correlated with that of the appearance of centrosome-associated MBD3. Accordingly, kinases present at mitotic centrosomes may be responsible for the phosphorylation of MBD3. Aurora-A is one such protein kinase. Aurora-A is expressed, activated, and localized at the centrosomes from the late G2 phase to anaphase (19Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 454-459Google Scholar, 29Kimura M. Kotani S. Hattori T. Sumi N. Yoshioka T. Todokoro K. Okano Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13766-13771Google Scholar, 30Shindo M. Nakano H. Kuroyanagi H. Shirasawa T. Mihara M. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Yagita H. Okumura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 285-292Google Scholar). We therefore examined the potential role of Aurora-A in MBD3 phosphorylation. First, localizations of endogenous MBD3 and Aurora-A in HeLa cells were examined using specific antibodies (Fig. 4). In the late G2phase and prophase, the earliest time point when Aurora-A localization at the centromeres was manifested, MBD3 was not yet localized at the centrosomes (Fig. 4, A and B). However, a fraction of MBD3 was co-localized with Aurora-A in prometaphase and metaphase cells in which two centrosomes were present at opposite poles (Fig. 4C for prometaphase; Fig. 4D for metaphase). MBD3 remained associated with Aurora-A at the centrosomes in the early anaphase (Fig. 4E). These results suggest that a population of MBD3 is transiently localized at Aurora-A-positive centrosomes from prometaphase to early anaphase. This association appears to occur only after Aurora-A is already present at the centrosomes and the two centrosomes have moved to opposite poles (Figs.3 and 4). MBD3 is a component of the NuRD complex. Given the transient localization of MBD3 at the centrosomes in the early M phase, we were interested in whether other components of NuRD may show similar distributions. IF studies using anti-HDAC1 antibodies revealed that HDAC1 shows essentially the same distribution as MBD3 during M phase. The results of the double staining of HDAC1 and Aurora-A are shown in Fig. 5, and similar results were obtained in the double staining of HDAC1 and γ-tubulin (data not shown). HDAC1 was co-localized at two oppositely positioned centrosomes with Aurora-A from prometaphase to early anaphase. Interestingly, we did not observe any localization of HDAC1 at the mid zone in late anaphase, although future studies are necessary to confirm these different distributions of MBD3 and HDAC1 in the late M phase. We observed MTA2 similarly distribute at the Aurora-A-positive centrosomes in early M phase (data not shown). Taken together, it was suggested that the NuRD complex transiently interacts with Aurora-A-positive centrosomes in the early M phase. To obtain biochemical evidence showing the association between MBD3 and Aurora-A, we performed an immunoprecipitation experiment. Genes encoding HA-tagged MBD3 and Glu-tagged Aurora-A were transiently transfected into COS cells individually or simultaneously. The cells were lysed, and protein extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Glu antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of HA-MBD3 in the immunoprecipitated complex only when both HA-MBD3 and Glu-Aurora-A were overexpressed (Fig. 6, lane 3). Therefore, it was concluded that MBD3 and Aurora-A associatein vivo either directly or indirectly. Because MBD3 is phosphorylated in the late G2 to early M phase (Fig. 2) and Aurora-A is active during these cell cycle stages, it is possible that Aurora-A phosphorylates MBD3. To examine this possibility, we prepared bacterially expressed HA-tagged MBD3 fused with GST (GST-HA-MBD3), HA-tagged GST (GST-HA), and Aurora-A. Aurora-A and either GST-HA-MBD3 or GST-HA were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The amounts of proteins measured by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining are indicated in Fig. 7B. We found that GST-HA-MBD3, GST-HA, and Aurora-A were efficiently labeled in this in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 7A). One explanation for these res"
https://openalex.org/W1991430024,"Studies in Jurkat leukemia cells have suggested that protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPL1/FAP-1 rescues Fas-induced cell death. However, we have previously shown that this enzyme triggers 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced growth inhibition in human breast cancer cells. The present study addresses the role of PTPL1/FAP-1 in antiestrogen-regulated apoptotic effect and insulin-like growth factor-I survival action in MCF7 cells and further identifies the impacted signaling pathway. By terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling and cytoplasmic nucleosome enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we demonstrated that 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced apoptosis was totally lost in PTPL1/FAP-1 antisense transfectants in which enzyme expression was abrogated, revealing the crucial role of this phosphatase in the apoptotic process in human breast cancer cells. Time-dependent expression of PTPL1/FAP-1 in MCF7 cells completely abolished the survival action of insulin-like growth factor-I. This effect occurred through a highly significant reduction in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway activation (80% reduction in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, 55% inhibition of Akt activation) accompanied by a 65% decrease in insulin receptor substrate-1 growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. These results provide the first evidence that PTPL1/FAP-1 has a key role in the apoptotic process in human breast cancer cells independent of Fas but associated with an early inhibition of the insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Our data therefore suggest new therapeutic routes and strengthen the importance of identifying endogenous regulators and substrates of this phosphatase in breast tumors.

Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies affecting women in the Western countries. Although mortality and survival rates decreased in the UK (1Peto R. Boreham J. Clarke M. Davies C. Beral V. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1822Google Scholar), breast cancer incidence is still increasing. It is therefore crucial in the coming years to design new therapeutic strategies based on the updated knowledge of the mechanisms by which tumor growth is sustained. Breast cancer proliferation is the result of the balance between cell division and cell apoptosis. It has been shown in vitro in human breast cancer cell models that steroid hormones (mostly estrogens) and growth factors (epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor α, IGF-I 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; DCC/FCS, dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal calf serum; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; OH-Tam, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling; wt, wild type 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; DCC/FCS, dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal calf serum; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; OH-Tam, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling; wt, wild type and II, etc.) are the major signals affecting proliferation (2Freiss G. Prebois C. Vignon F. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 27: 57-68Google Scholar, 3Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 559-589Google Scholar). Most of these factors stimulate cell division and/or promote cell survival by mechanisms yet poorly understood, thus conferring growth advantage to tumor-responsive cells. On the other side, growth inhibitors and various antagonists have been shown to increase breast cancer cell apoptosis (4Bardon S. Vignon F. Montcourrier P. Rochefort H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1441-1448Google Scholar, 5Ellis P.A. Saccani-Jotti G. Clarke R. Johnston S.R. Anderson E. Howell A. A'Hern R. Salter J. Detre S. Nicholson R. Robertson J. Smith I.E. Dowsett M. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 608-613Google Scholar). Estrogens and their antagonists mediate their action through their nuclear receptors (estrogen receptors α and β), acting as transcriptional factors in coordination with numerous additional transcriptional cofactors. Peptide hormones and growth factor-signaling pathways involve the activation of several kinase cascades (mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, etc.). We and others provided evidence for the existence of multiple interactions between these seemingly distinct pathways (6Vignon F. Bouton M.M. Rochefort H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1502-1508Google Scholar, 7Ignar-Trowbridge D.M. Nelson K.G. Bidwell M.C. Curtis S.W. Washburn T.F. McLachlan J.A. Korach K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that steroidal and non-steroidal antiestrogens such as tamoxifen, which is currently used in breast cancer adjuvant therapy, inhibit the growth of estrogen receptor-positive cells not only by acting as competitors of hormone agonists on the nuclear receptors but also by preventing growth factor mitogenic action in the total absence of estrogens (6Vignon F. Bouton M.M. Rochefort H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1502-1508Google Scholar). Cell growth inhibition, evidenced by the drastic decrease in the overall cell DNA measurement, correlated with the expression of some protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) (11Freiss G. Vignon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1389-1396Google Scholar), among which is PTPL1/FAP-1 (12Banville D. Ahmad S. Stocco R. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22320-22327Google Scholar, 13Maekawa K. Imagawa N.

Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Google Scholar), whose mRNA accumulation is time- and dose-dependently regulated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OH-Tam) and ICI 182,780 (16Freiss G. Puech C. Vignon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 568-579Google Scholar). Using stable transfectants expressing PTPL1/FAP-1 RNA antisense, we have shown that this particular enzyme was a key factor in the OH-Tam-induced anti-growth factor action. The role of PTP in breast cancer cell apoptosis is poorly understood, and SHP-1 was the only enzyme yet clearly implicated in somatostatin-induced apoptosis (17Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Shen S.H. Srikant C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29549-29557Google Scholar). Besides, a study in Jurkat cells proposed an antiapoptotic role of PTPL1/FAP-1 by inhibition of the Fas-signaling pathway (15Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Google Scholar), whereas MCF7 cells like the majority of the breast cancer cell lines are resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis (18Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Lowrey G.A. Russell E.K. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4791-4798Google Scholar). Our present study was designed to evaluate the role of PTPL1/FAP-1 in the apoptotic process and to determine PTPL1/FAP-1 action on the survival signaling pathway stimulated by IGF-I. Using PTPL1/FAP-1 antisense transfectants in which enzyme expression is abrogated, we here demonstrate that protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPL1/FAP-1 abolishes the survival action of IGF-I by a drastic inhibition of the IRS-1/PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. Altogether, these data bring the first evidence for a new biological role of PTPL1/FAP-1 independent of Fas, which might offer new breast cancer therapeutic strategies. All biochemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. MCF7 human breast cancer cells were obtained from the Michigan Cancer Foundation (Detroit, MI). Establishment and characterization of stable PTPL1 antisense-expressing clones were previously described (16Freiss G. Puech C. Vignon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 568-579Google Scholar), B3 and B10, respectively, corresponding to clones 3 and 10. MCF7 cells and derived clones were maintained in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen). Before all hormonal treatments, the cells were stripped of endogenous steroids by successive passages in medium without phenol red containing 10% (2 days), then 3% (5 days) charcoal-stripped (DCC) FCS. They were finally treated with E2, IGF-I, OH-Tam, IGF-I plus OH-Tam, or ethanol alone (control) in the presence of 1% DCC/FCS. Attached cells were collected in a buffer containing 5 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100 combined with unattached cells and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 ×g (4 °C). The pellet containing unfragmented DNA was assayed for DNA content by the diaminobenzoic acid fluorometric method (LS-5 spectrometer, 405 nm excitation, 495 nm emission, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after 2 washes with methanol as in Vignon et al. (6Vignon F. Bouton M.M. Rochefort H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1502-1508Google Scholar). The supernatant was treated with 300 μg of proteinase K/ml for 30 min at 60 °C. DNA was extracted twice with equal volumes of phenol, chloroform, isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with 1/10 volume of sodium acetate (3 n) and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol. The pellets were washed once with 70% ethanol and resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl in the proportions of 1 μl of buffer for 2 μg of unfragmented DNA assayed in the first pellet. Cytoplasmic DNA was then treated with 60 μg of RNase A/ml for 60 min at 37 °C. 15 μl of cytoplasmic DNA was run on a 1.5% agarose gel for 4 h at 50 V. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL assay by using the ApopTag direct in situ apoptosis detection kit with peroxidase (Oncor). Attached cells were harvested by trypsinization, combined with unattached cells, fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 5 min in 0.1% Triton X-100, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Next 2.5 × 105 cells were spread on glass slides by use of a Cytospin. Detection of apoptotic cells and counterstaining with hematoxylin were performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The slides were viewed and photographed, and the apoptotic index was calculated as the percentage of nuclei labeled by peroxidase using a Samba analyzer (Alcatel). At least 103 cells were examined and evaluated in each sample. 2 × 105 cells were plated on 30-mm duplicate dishes. At the indicated time points, one dish was assayed for total DNA contents by the diaminobenzoic acid method (6Vignon F. Bouton M.M. Rochefort H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1502-1508Google Scholar), and cells from the other dish were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and assayed for the presence of nucleosomal fragments in the cytoplasm by a cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ELISA results were normalized to the total DNA value from the duplicate dish. Phospholipid mixtures (2 mg/ml) containing PI and phosphatidylserine were dried under a stream of nitrogen and sonicated twice at 100 watts for 15 s in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4). The resulting vesicles (PI/phosphatidylserine) were used as a substrate for PI3-K. The preparation of cell extracts and immunoprecipitation for PI3-K were performed at 4 °C. The cultured cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 100 kallikrein units/ml Trasylol). After gentle shaking for 30 min, the cell extracts were obtained by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The PI3-K from extracts containing equal amounts of protein, evaluated by Bradford assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), was immunoprecipitated with antiserum against IRS-1 (Upstate Biotechnology) and retained on protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, twice with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 m LiCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mmNa3VO4. All washes were performed at 4 °C. The reaction mixtures (50 μl), containing the immunoprecipitates in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 80 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of PI/phosphatidylserine were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated, and the lipids were extracted by the addition of 10 volumes of chloroform/methanol/HCl (11.6 n) (50:100:1). The mixture was then vortexed, and the organic phase was extracted with 2 volumes of methanol, 4 n HCl (1:1). The extracted products were desiccated, dissolved in 10 μl of chloroform, and separated by thin-layer chromatography in a developing solution composed of chloroform, methanol, 4 m NH4OH (9:7:2). The production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was detected and quantified by counting with a Fujix-Bas 1000. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 kallikrein units/ml Trasylol) and separated on a 10% gel by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with antiserum against PTPL1/FAP-1 (H 300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or against actin (Sigma). Proteins were later visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Sigma) followed by Renaissance chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and IRS-1 from extracts containing equal amounts of protein was immunoprecipitated with antiserum against IRS-1 and retained on protein G-Sepharose (see PI3-K assay). After washes, the immunoprecipitates were separated on an 10% gel by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with antiserum against p85 (anti PI3-K p85, Upstate Biotechnology). Proteins were finally visualized as previously described. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (see PI3-K assay) and separated on a 10% gel by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to Hybond-P membrane (AmershamBiosciences) and incubated with anti-Akt or anti-phospho-Akt (New England Biolabs, Ser-473). Proteins were visualized as previously described. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and IRS-1 from extracts containing equal amounts of protein was immunoprecipitated with antiserum against IRS-1 and retained on protein G-Sepharose (see PI3-K assay). After washes, the immunoprecipitates were separated on an 8% gel by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with anti-Tyr(P) (4G10) or anti-IRS-1 (Upstate Biotechnology). Proteins were visualized as mentioned above. Our previous studies about the respective roles of OH-Tam, IGF-I, and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPL1 on MCF7 growth regulation were based upon the evaluation of total cell numbers assessed by DNA cell measurement after diverse treatments (11Freiss G. Vignon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1389-1396Google Scholar). However, this global estimation did not discriminate between the relative contributions of the mitotic and/or the apoptotic indexes to the net growth rate. The presence in MCF7 cells of widely accepted morphological modifications induced by the apoptotic process have been long recognized both in vitro (4Bardon S. Vignon F. Montcourrier P. Rochefort H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1441-1448Google Scholar, 20Kyprianou N. English H.F. Davidson N.E. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 162-166Google Scholar) and in animal xenografts after steroid antagonist treatments or estrogen withdrawal (21Huovinen R. Warri A. Collan Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 685-691Google Scholar). However, the presence of apoptosis-associated biochemical evidence such as DNA fragmentation remained a matter of debate in the literature (22Gooch J.L. Yee D. Cancer Lett. 1999; 144: 31-37Google Scholar, 23Gooch J.L. Van Den Berg C.L. Yee D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 56: 1-10Google Scholar). Therefore, we have first evaluated whether IGF-I and OH-Tam modulations of apoptosis were associated with DNA strand breaks in our present culture conditions. We have indeed shown that OH-Tam treatment induced a marked DNA fragmentation in MCF7 cells (Fig.1 A, fourth lane). With this technique, we are, thus, able to confirm the apoptotic effect of OH-Tam (4Bardon S. Vignon F. Montcourrier P. Rochefort H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1441-1448Google Scholar) and observe the survival action of IGF-I in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1 A, third lane). Furthermore, by examining DNA laddering, we have shown that the antiestrogen was able to counteract the survival action of IGF-I. DNA degradation was indeed equivalent in control untreated cells and in cells submitted to a 4-day simultaneous treatment with IGF-I and OH-Tam (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes two and five). We have quantified apoptosis with two alternative biochemical techniques, the TUNEL assay, which allows the determination of the percentage of labeled apoptotic nuclei after cytocentrifugation of the pooled cell fractions (attached, loosely attached, and floating; Fig. 1 B, typical nuclear staining) or a quantitative ELISA of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes). Using these two assays, we have first applied a long term treatment (7 days) to quantify apoptosis in wild-type (wt) MCF7 cells in conditions in which we previously demonstrated a drastic inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated overall growth by OH-Tam (11Freiss G. Vignon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1389-1396Google Scholar). The two methods gave very similar results and confirmed OH-Tam pro-apoptotic effect as well as its capacity to inhibit IGF-I survival activity in wt MCF7 cells (Fig.2, A and B,black bars). In the TUNEL assay (Fig. 2 A), although less than 10% of the cells were apoptotic in control culture conditions, we observed that OH-Tam treatment raised the percentage of apoptosis to greater than 40%, whereas as high as 30% apoptosis was counted in the presence of IGF-I and OH-Tam. Similarly, ELISA provided evidence of a 3.9-fold increase of apoptosis with OH-Tam alone and a 2.6-fold augmentation in the presence of IGF-I and OH-Tam (Fig. 2 B). The results obtained with both biochemical methods strongly provided evidence that the drastic increase in OH-Tam-induced apoptosis was responsible for its anti-growth factor activity.Figure 2Quantification of apoptosis by TUNEL assay or cytoplasmic nucleosomes ELISA in PTPL1-positive or -defective cells. After stripping from endogenous steroids, wt MCF7 cells (MCF7-wt), mock-transfected clone (P4), and PTPL1 antisense transfected clones (B3 and B10) were cultured in the presence of the indicated compounds for 7 days (A and B). After collection of cells, apoptosis was quantified by TUNEL assay (A) or ELISA of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (B). Results are expressed as the means ± S.D. of two or three experiments as indicated; inA, * indicates p = 0.05, and ** indicatesp < 0.01 (B3 versus MCF7 and P4); inB, * indicates p ≤ 0.05, and ** indicatesp < 0.01 (B3 or B10 versus MCF7 and P4) according to Student's t test. (C, control.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The present results associated with our previous data demonstrating that OH-Tam anti-growth factor activity required PTPL1 expression and correlated with phosphatase up-regulation (16Freiss G. Puech C. Vignon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 568-579Google Scholar) led us to propose that PTPL1 was a key factor in OH-Tam-induced cell death. To demonstrate the role of PTPL1/FAP-1 in apoptosis, we have compared by TUNEL assay or ELISA the effect of various combinations of 7-day treatments on the degree of apoptosis in wt MCF7 cells, the void plasmid mock-transfectant clone (P4), and two MCF7-derived stable clones transfected with PTPL1 cDNA antisense plasmids in which OH-Tam was no longer able to block IGF-I action on growth (16Freiss G. Puech C. Vignon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 568-579Google Scholar). We showed an overall lower sensitivity of antisense clones to OH-Tam treatment, with a positive correlation between resistance to apoptosis and antisense expression (Fig. 2, A andB). After treatment with antiestrogen alone there was a gradual significant decrease in the level of apoptosis, from 3.5 to 4 times the control level in wt MCF7 and mock-transfected P4 to 2–3-fold control in low or high antisense expresser B10 or B3 clones (Fig. 2, A and B). After simultaneous treatment with IGF-I and OH-Tam, the apoptosis level reached 2–3 times the control level (60–70% of OH-Tam alone level) in PTPL1-expressing cells and went down to 1.3–1.5 times the control level in the B10 clone to finally attain the control level or even slightly below the control level in the B3 antisense clone (Fig. 2, A andB). These data clearly point to the essential role of PTPL1 in the apoptotic process. In the B3 clone, after 7 days of OH-Tam treatment we observed a residual induction of apoptosis and a remaining inhibition of IGF-I survival effect (Fig. 2, A and B). These effects could result either from an accumulation of PTPL1 mRNA bypassing antisense inhibition or from distinct mechanisms of apoptosis induction by OH-Tam that do not require PTPL1 expression. We had shown that a 5-day treatment with OH-Tam was sufficient to increase PTP activity in wt MCF7, whereas it remained inefficient in B3 and B10 clones (16Freiss G. Puech C. Vignon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 568-579Google Scholar). By direct Western blotting with an N-terminal PTPL1/FAP-1 antibody, we have now demonstrated that enzyme protein expression and antiestrogen regulation (5-day treatment) were severely reduced in B10 and completely abolished in B3 as compared with wt MCF7 or P4 mock transfectant (Fig. 3 A). We then quantified apoptosis in wt MCF7 and on the three stable derived transfectants after a 5-day treatment with the various combinations of compounds. In these conditions, OH-Tam displayed the same apoptotic activity and capacity to reverse IGF-I survival effect in wt or mock-transfected MCF7 cells (Fig. 3 B). On the opposite, the antiestrogen could not significantly induce apoptosis and led to partial (B10) or no (B3) inhibition of IGF-I survival effect in PTPL1-defective clones (Fig. 3 B). After such a shorter period of treatment, we obtained a perfect correlation between PTPL1 expression and apoptosis induction or IGF-I survival effect inhibition. The next step was therefore to determine which signaling pathway was affected in PTPL1 apoptosis induction. It is well established that IGF-I has a strong antiapoptotic function in many cell lines (for review, see Ref. 24Baserga R. Prisco M. Hongo A. Rosenfeld R.G. Roberts Jr., C.T. The IGF System. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 329-353Google Scholar), but the survival pathway used by IGF-I against apoptotic injury is uncertain. In many cell lines, the importance of the PI3-K/Akt pathway has been demonstrated (25Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Google Scholar), but it is also clear that the IGF-IR is connected to several alternative pathways, which include mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (26Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Google Scholar). We therefore tested in MCF7 cells the impact of specific inhibitors of these two major pathways on apoptosis and IGF-I survival effect. Representative data of Fig. 4 clearly demonstrated that the MEK-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor PD98059 was without effect, whereas the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 induced apoptosis and partially inhibited IGF-I protective effect in this breast cancer cell line. This partial remaining of IGF-I survival signaling indicated that, as in other cell lines (27Navarro M. Baserga R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1073-1081Google Scholar), additional connecting pathways contributed to IGF-I antiapoptotic activity in MCF7 cells. However, the results obtained with LY294002 pointed to the fundamental function of the PI3-K/Akt pathway in the control of cell death in MCF7 cells, and furthermore, the similarity between LY294002 and OH-Tam action suggested an inhibitory action of the antiestrogen, and most probably of PTPL1, on the PI3-K/Akt pathway (Fig. 4). This pathway originates with the phosphorylation of the major IGF-IR substrate, IRS-1 (28Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Google Scholar), which in turn activates PI3-K and downstream Akt (25Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Google Scholar). Among the concluding steps are the inhibitory phosphorylations by Akt of the caspase 9 (29Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Google Scholar) and of Bad (30Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Google Scholar), one of the pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. To further document the involvement of this pathway in PTPL1 action, we have tested the effect of OH-Tam pretreatment, on the association of PI-3K p85 regulatory subunit with IRS-1, and on the PI-3K activity after IGF-I activation in wt MCF7 cells and transfectants. OH-Tam significantly reduced PI3-K activation by IGF-I in wild-type and P4 mock-transfected MCF7 cells (respectively, 75 and 85% inhibition) (Fig.5, B and C; see Fig. 7) without any significant change in IRS-1 expression (Fig.5 A). Moreover, OH-Tam selectively inhibited to the same extent the p85/IRS-1 association in the P4 mock-transfected clone (90% inhibition) (Fig. 6 A,top panel, and B) without any change in p85 expression (Fig. 6 A, bottom panel). These data indicate, as suggested previously when comparing LY294002 and OH-Tam effects on apoptosis (Fig. 4), that the antiestrogen has a strong inhibitory action on the PI3-K/Akt pathway. We did not know yet if the residual PI3-K activity observed after 4 days of OH-Tam treatment in MCF7 cells could be sufficient for full activation of the downstream effector in this survival pathway, the activation of Akt. We have therefore estimated Akt activation by probing Western blots with specific antibody to phosphorylated Akt and evidenced a drastic inhibition (55%) of its activation in wild-type and mock-transfected MCF7 cells (see Fig. 8, A and B). This indicates that the reduction in PI3-K activation by OH-Tam was sufficient for severely impeding this survival pathway. We have shown (Fig.5 A) that IRS-1 expression was not affected by OH-Tam treatment. Therefore, inhibition of PI3-K activity observed after 4 days of OH-Tam treatment in MCF7 cells could be due to a direct PI3-K inhibition or IRS-1 dephosphorylation. We have then evaluated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation by IRS-1 immunoprecipitation and anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots. In mock-t"

Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP: structures, metabolism and functions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht2002Google Scholar). To directly prove the involvement of RyR in this phase, we intended to knock-down the type 3 RyR by an antisense RNA approach; the type 3 RyR was chosen because it appeared to be the major isoform of RyR in Jurkat T cells (2Guse A.H. da Silva C.P.

Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar) was used. Commercially available Jurkat T cells stably transfected with the regulatory pTet-On plasmid (Clontech) were further transfected by electroporation with the responsive plasmid pTRE2 (Clontech). The following cDNA fragments were cloned in antisense orientation into the plasmid pTRE2: a 511-bp cDNA fragment from the human type 3 RyR corresponding to base pairs 12657–13167 (NCRI nucleotide data base accession number NM_001036.1) of the type 3 RyR mRNA (pTRE2-511) and an irrelevant control 250-bp cDNA fragment from EGFP (pTRE2-EGFP). The cells were co-transfected with the hygromycin resistance plasmid pTK-Hyg to allow for hygromycin resistance selection.After electroporation selection was first carried out in bulk culture and, after the death of the majority of cells (about 95%), stable, hygromycin-resistant clones were obtained by limiting dilution (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). For the type 3 RyR antisense plasmid pTRE2-511, 57 clones out of 400 wells were obtained; for the control plasmid pTRE2-EGFP, 29 clones out of 266 wells were obtained. The clones were selected according to the following strategy: first, the stable integration of the plasmids into the genome of the Tet-On Jurkat T cells was analyzed by PCR of genomic DNA; secondly, expression of antisense mRNA was determined by RT-PCR; and thirdly, reduced expression of the type 3 RyR was checked by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.PCR of genomic DNA was conducted 3 months after transfection, assuring that the plasmids were either stably integrated or degraded. PCR of genomic DNA data from a selection of individual clones (clones 21–41) demonstrates that a sufficient number of stably transfected clones for the type 3 RyR antisense plasmid pTRE2-511 was generated (Fig. 1 A, left panel). Similarly, for the control plasmid pTRE2-EGFP and for vector-transfected cells (pTRE2), sufficient stably transfected clones were obtained (Fig. 1 A, right panel). In total, 56% of pTRE2-511 clones and 72% of pTRE2-EGFP clones were stably transfected.RT-PCR was conducted with total RNA prepared from clones that showed stable integration of the respective plasmids during genomic PCR. To analyze for inducibility, clones were cultured in the absence or presence of doxycyclin (1 μg/ml) for 2 days. Seven clones expressing antisense mRNA were obtained for pTRE2-511, and five clones for pTRE2-EGFP. Unfortunately, in almost all cases, no inducibility was found as exemplified for clone pTRE2-511#25 (Fig. 1 B, left panel) and the clones pTRE2-EGFP#E2 and #E4 (Fig. 1 B, right panel). However, since all clones were growing at reasonable rates, our initial concern that permanent suppression of RyR expression might be cytotoxic and thus that the cells might not be sufficiently expandable turned out not to be a serious problem. Thus, for further detailed characterization, only a few clones were selected: type 3 RyR antisense clone pTRE2-511#25 and control clones pTRE2-EGFP#E1 and #E2.SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of clone pTRE2-511#25 revealed a greatly reduced expression of RyR as compared with the parent Tet-On Jurkat cell and with the control clones pTRE2-EGFP#E1 (Fig. 2) and pTRE2-EGFP#E2 (data not shown). In contrast, there was no change in expression of the IP3R (Fig. 2), suggesting that expression of other proteins essentially involved in Ca2+ signaling was not altered by transfection with pTRE2 plasmids.Figure 2Western blot analysis of expression of RyR and IP3R. Parent Jurkat Tet-On Jurkat cells and clones pTRE2-511#25 and pTRE2-EGFP#E1 were homogenized, and P10 membranes were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein (50 μg/lane) was separated on reducing SDS-PAGE (3% stacking, 6% separating gel). The proteins were tank-blotted (see “Experimental Procedures”) onto a nitrocellulose membrane. This membrane was cut into two pieces according to the relative position of RyR and IP3R. The channels were made visible by incubation with specific primary antibodies followed by secondary, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lanes marked with Dox and + indicate that the cells had been cultured in the presence of doxycyclin (1 μg/ml) for 6 days before preparation of P10 membranes. For comparison of protein mass, type 1 RyR highly purified from heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit muscle (kind gift of Prof. M. Hohenegger, Vienna, Austria) was analyzed in parallel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TCR/CD3 complex-mediated Ca2+ signaling was first analyzed in cell suspension in a dual-wavelength spectrophotometer (Table I and Fig. 3). The basal [Ca2+]i was slightly but not significantly elevated in the clones pTRE2-511#25, pTRE2-EGFP#E1, and #E2 (Table I), indicating that the Ca2+ clearance mechanisms of the cells, e.g. the Ca2+ pumps of the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane, were unaltered by the transfection process. Upon stimulation with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3, the parent Tet-On Jurkat T cells and all clones showed the typical biphasic pattern of Ca2+ signaling (17Guse A.H. Lee H.C. Cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP: structures, metabolism and functions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht2002Google Scholar). Most importantly, the sustained Ca2+ signal of the type 3 RyR antisense clone pTRE2-511#25 was significantly reduced as compared with the parent Tet-On Jurkat T cell or with control clones pTRE2-EGFP#E1 and #E2 (Fig. 3). In accordance with suppression of type 3 RyR expression already occurring without induction by doxycyclin (Fig. 2), there was no difference between cells preincubated without (Fig. 3 A) or with doxycyclin (Fig. 3 B). A second TET-On Jurkat T cell clone stably transfected with a different antisense construct against the type 3 RyR showed a similar reduction of the sustained Ca2+signal (data not shown). These data suggest that the type 3 RyR is involved in the sustained phase of T cell Ca2+ signaling. In contrast, the initial rapid Ca2+ peak was not different between the different clones, except for a slightly increased Ca2+ peak in clone pTRE2-EGFP#E1.Table IBasal global [Ca2+]i in the different Tet-On Jurkat T cell clonesCloneTet-On parentpTRE2-511#25pTRE-EGFP#E1pTRE-EGFP#E2[Ca2+]i[nm]43 ± 13 (n = 20)55 ± 16 (n = 9)52 ± 19 (n = 13)52 ± 16 (n = 11)[Ca2+]i[nm]/dox43 ± 15 (n = 11)57 ± 17 (n = 8)53 ± 16 (n = 13)50 ± 14 (n = 11)[Ca2+]i was determined in Fura2-loaded cell suspensions as described in Fig. 3.

A deconvolution-based confocal Ca2+ imaging technique was recently developed in our laboratory and applied to the analysis of pacemaking subcellular Ca2+ signals that appear between stimulation and the first global Ca2+ signal in Jurkat T cells.2 In the current study, a modified protocol was used for the first time to analyze subcellular Ca2+signals at a much later time point, e.g. in the sustained phase where a significant difference between the type 3 RyR antisense clone pTRE2-511#25 and the control clones pTRE2-EGFP#E1 and #E2 was already observed in cell suspension (Fig. 3). Stimulation of both clone pTRE2-EGFP#E1 and clone pTRE2-511#25 by solid-phase bound OKT3 activated a rapid, global, and high Ca2+ response in almost all cells (Fig. 4, A andD). However, as already seen in suspension (Fig. 3), there was a significantly reduced phase of sustained Ca2+signaling in type 3 RyR antisense clone pTRE2-511#25 as compared with control clone pTRE2-EGFP#E1 (Fig. 4, A and D). Analysis of the subcellular Ca2+ signals of two single cells (Fig. 4, A and D, red lines) representative of the average of clone pTRE2-511#25 and clone pTRE2-EGFP#E1 (Fig. 4, A and D, green lines) revealed a drastically reduced number of individual Ca2+ signals with amplitudes >115 nm (Fig. 4,B and E, dotted lines in Cand F). Most importantly, both the total number and the amplitudes of the subcellular Ca2+ signals in three different regions of the cell were significantly lower for clone pTRE2-511#25 as compared with clone pTRE2-EGFP#E1 (Fig. 4, Cand F). These data represent the first characterization of subcellular Ca2+ signals in type 3 RyR-deficient T cells and demonstrate that the type 3 RyR is necessary for amplification of local Ca2+ signals during the sustained phase of T cell Ca2+ signaling.Figure 4Analysis of TCR/CD3 complex-mediated local Ca2+ signaling in type 3 RyR-deficient Jurkat T cells. The cells were loaded with Fura2-AM as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Confocal Ca2+ imaging was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells, either control clone pTRE2-EGFP#E1 or type 3 RyR antisense clone pTRE2-511#25, were placed on the stage of the confocal imaging system in a small chamber mounted on thin glass coverslips coated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3.

Fig. 5 (left panel) shows typical Ca2+ release tracings obtained by addition of 10 μm cADPR in the type 3 RyR antisense clone pTRE2-511#25 as compared with the parent Tet-On Jurkat T cell and the control clone pTRE2-EGFP#E1. The response to cADPR was significantly reduced, whereas IP3 released Ca2+ at a similar magnitude in the three different clones (Fig. 5, right panel). These data demonstrate directly that knock-down of the type 3 RyR significantly decreases the Ca2+-mobilizing effect of cADPR.Figure 5Analysis of Ca2+ release by cADPR and IP3 in type 3 RyR-deficient Jurkat T cells. Permeabilized cells were prepared, and [Ca2+] was determined in the presence of Fura2, ATP, an ATP-regenerating system in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorimeter operated in the ratio mode (alternating excitation wavelengths, 340 and 380 nm; emission wavelength, 495 nm) as described recently (34Guse A.H.

Stable integration of the antisense plasmid was demonstrated by genomic PCR, and expression of antisense mRNA was demonstrated by RT-PCR. The clone was successfully used to analyze the role of type 3 RyR in TCR/CD3 complex-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Reduced expression of the type 3 RyR resulted in significantly decreased Ca2+signaling in the sustained phase and a significantly impaired response toward cADPR but not IP3. For the first time, the role of the type 3 RyR in sustained Ca2+ signaling was directly visualized as a significant contribution to the number and the magnitude of subcellular Ca2+ signals.Although complementary RNA and DNA have been widely used for gene silencing, the mechanisms underlying these antisense approaches were not well understood (reviewed in Ref. 21Nellen W. Liechtenstein C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 419-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, the discoveries that (i) double-stranded RNA was a better gene silencer than antisense RNA (23Fire A., Xu, S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11567) Google Scholar), (ii) double-stranded RNA is cleaved to small interfering RNA (24Elbashir S. Lendeckel W. Tuschl W. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar), and (iii) such small interfering RNA then activates specific digest of the original mRNA by the so-called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (27Hammond S.M. Bernstein E. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar) likely suggest that the antisense RNA acts via small interfering RNA. For intracellular Ca2+ channels, different antisense approaches have been used. Macrez and co-workers (20Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.-L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) injected chemically modified (phosphorothioate) antisense DNA oligomers directed toward each single subtype of RyR into single rat portal vein myocytes in primary culture, and after a few days, they analyzed the efficacy of their antisense approach by RT-PCR and staining of single cells by BODIPY FL-X ryanodine. Knock-down of both type 1 and type 2 RyR efficiently decreased local and global Ca2+ responses activated by membrane depolarization or angiotensin II, whereas caffeine-activated global Ca2+signaling was only partially reduced (20Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.-L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, knock-down of type 3 RyR had no effect on these activation pathways (20Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.-L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, under conditions of Ca2+ overload, type 3 RyR was activated by caffeine or local increases in [Ca2+]i (28Mironneau J. Coussin F. Jeyakumar L.H. Fleischer S. Mironneau C. Macrez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11257-11264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These impressive studies showed for the first time by a molecular approach the function of the different RyR subtypes in portal vein smooth muscle cells. However, a disadvantage of the experimental strategy of Macrez and co-workers (20Coussin F. Macrez N. Morel J.-L. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9596-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was that only a limited number of cells could be injected with antisense oligomers, making Western blot analysis of the proteins impossible. In addition, no stable cell lines were established, requiring repeated laborious injections of antisense oligomers. A different approach toward the IP3R was carried out by Marks and colleagues (19Jayaraman T. Ondriasova E. Ondrias K. Harnick D.J. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar): Jurkat T cells were stably expressed with a vector, allowing for constitutive expression (pREP10) containing a fragment of the human type 1 IP3R in antisense orientation. Although the proliferation rate of these cells decreased by about 75%, it was impressively demonstrated that deletion of the IP3R almost completely impaired TCR/CD3-mediated Ca2+ signaling but not capacitative Ca2+signaling activated by the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (19Jayaraman T. Ondriasova E. Ondrias K. Harnick D.J. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These important results suggest that (i) the whole machinery of T cell Ca2+signaling depends on rapid, IP3-mediated Ca2+release in the first minutes of T cell activation and that (ii) additional Ca2+ channels are present in Jurkat T cells allowing for passive Ca2+ leak from the endoplasmic reticulum in case of thapsigargin stimulation. Both results were confirmed recently: microinjection of the IP3 antagonistd-myo-inositol 1,4,6-phosphorothioate before TCR/CD3 stimulation completely abolished Ca2+ signaling (2Guse A.H. da Silva C.P.

Despite these conflicting data, one consistent finding has been that Nef interacts with various signaling molecules, including members of the Src kinase family such as Hck and Lck, the latter a protein tyrosine kinase associated with CD4 and T cell receptor function (12Lee C.H.

Moreover, Nef may affect mediators of apoptosis and thereby foster the longevity of infected cells (18Wolf D. Witte V. Laffert B. Blume K. Stromer E. Trapp S. D'Aloja P. Schürmann A. Baur A.S. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1217-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Recently, Nef was shown to activate ERK1/2 in primary CD4+ T cells obtained from peripheral blood (21Schrager J.A. der Minassian V. Marsh J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6137-6142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The ERK kinases are members of the MAP kinase family and can participate in a variety of cell functions, including growth and migration (22Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3074-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In macrophages, the nef gene product has been linked to alterations in chemokine production (6Swingler S. Mann A. Jacque J.M. Brichacek B. Sasseville V.G. Williams K. Lackner A.A. Janoff E.N. Wang R. Fisher D. Stevenson M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), indicating a possible role of Nef in the regulation of lymphocyte chemotaxis. Furthermore, the capacity of Nef to alter intracellular signaling molecules suggested that mediators of chemotaxis could be affected. To our knowledge, however, there are no reports of Nef affecting T cell chemotaxis. Here we report that HIV Nef significantly inhibited the response of CD4+ T cells to the physiological chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α). SDF-1 is a member of the CXC chemokine family. It was first identified as a pre-B-cell growth-stimulating factor and cloned from mouse bone marrow stromal cells (27Nagasawa T. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Its two forms, SDF-1α and -1β, arise from a single gene through alternative splicing. Human SDF-1α, a 7.8-kDa molecule, is a powerful chemoattractant for T lymphocytes, and its function has been well characterized (28Ganju R.K. Brubaker S.A. Meyer J. Dutt P. Yang Y. Qin S. Newman W.

Blood. 2002; 99: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). SDF-1α binds exclusively to the cell-surface receptor, CXCR4. The CXCR4 molecule is expressed on several cell types, including T lymphocytes, and has been shown to function as a co-receptor for certain strains of HIV (28Ganju R.K. Brubaker S.A. Meyer J. Dutt P. Yang Y. Qin S. Newman W. Groopman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23169-23175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In this study, we present a novel observation of HIV Nef inhibiting CD4+ T lymphocyte chemotaxis and altering critical downstream molecules in the CXCR4 pathway, including cytoskeletal regulatory proteins. These findings suggest that HIV Nef may blunt the T cell response to SDF-1α via intracellular disruption of CXCR4 receptor signaling. Because regulated migration of T cells in response to cognate chemotactic ligands is a key component of host defense (32Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cyster J.G. Science. 1999; 286: 2098-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), HIV Nef may act to impair T cell function and contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS. Recombinant SDF-1α was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Purified antibodies to phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-STAT1, PY99, actin, and p85 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-RAFTK antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Hava Avraham, Division of Experimental Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston (34Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myelin basic protein and antibody to 4G10 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Bovine serum albumin was obtained from Sigma. Electrophoresis reagents and nitrocellulose membranes were obtained from Bio-Rad. Permanent nef-expressing Jurkat T cell lines were constructed using the Clontech Tet-Off Gene Expression Systems. These cell lines produce GFP or HIV Nef-GFP proteins under Tet-Off control, meaning that gene expression was turned on when tetracycline was removed from the culture medium. The cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech-Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.2 mg/ml geneticin (G418), 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin, 2 μg/ml tetracycline (Tet). Gene expression was induced by culturing the cells for 48 h in culture medium without tetracycline. To confirm that the effect of Nef was not restricted to a Jurkat T cell line, effects of nef expression on migration of primary peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes were examined. Briefly, GFP and nef-GFP fusions were cloned in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-derived vector, and recombinant AAV-packaged GFP andnef-GFP were generated at a multiplicity of infection of 1.4 × 1012 and 1.2 × 1012, respectively, from the Harvard Medical School Core Facility. In this system, 1 multiplicity of infection corresponds to 1 virion particle per cell. For isolation of CD4+ T cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from fresh whole blood by density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences), washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), and counted on a hemocytometer using the trypan blue dye exclusion method. These cells were then stimulated with 5 μg of phytohemagglutinin per ml and 10% T cell stimulation factor (T-stim, Collaborative Biomedical Sciences) for 48 h. CD4+ T lymphocytes were isolated from the activated PBMC by high gradient magnetic cell sorting with a VarioMACS (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD4+ T lymphocytes were then aliquoted into 24-well tissue culture plates at 1 × 106 cells and transduced with the indicated amount of recombinant virions. Jurkat T cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 5 μg/ml phycoerythrin-labeled CXCR4 antibody, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in PBS buffer. They were then analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the levels of surface expression of the receptor. Cell supernatants were assayed for secretion of the chemokines SDF-1α, MIP-1α or -1β, and the cytokine IL-2 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Endogen Inc., Woburn, MA). Samples were assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Jurkat T cells were starved for 1 h by placing them in RPMI medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were counted using the trypan blue dye exclusion method and resuspended to a concentration of 106 cells per ml. Cells were then treated with 50 ng/ml SDF-1α for the indicated times (0–60 min). Chemotaxis assays were performed in duplicate using 5-μm pore filters (Transwell, 24-well cell clusters; Costar, Boston, MA). Briefly, 3 × 105 Jurkat cells or primary CD4+ T cells suspended in 300 μl of migration medium (RPMI + 0.5% bovine serum albumin) were loaded into each Transwell filter. Filters were then transferred to another well containing 600 μl of migration medium with the indicated concentrations of SDF-1α. The plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 h. The upper chambers were removed, and the cells in the bottom chambers were washed with 1× PBS, resuspended, and quantitated using the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Results of the chemotaxis assays presented here are representative of multiple repetitions of the same experiment with similar results. For the immunoprecipitation studies, identical amounts of protein from each sample were incubated with different primary antibodies for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations of the antibody-antigen complexes were performed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (10% suspension). Nonspecific bound proteins were removed by washing the Sepharose beads 3 times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS. Bound proteins were separated on NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk protein and probed with the appropriate primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences). Data shown are representative of multiple experiments. SDF-1α-treated cells, described above, were lysed in 300 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 + 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin). PI3K was immunoprecipitated using anti-p85 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with wash buffer 1 (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) and three times with wash buffer 2 (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA). Samples were resuspended in 35 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA), with 10 μg of phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), and the mixture was sonicated for 5 min. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) and carried out at 25 °C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 300 μl of MeOH, 1m HCl (1:1 v/v). The lipids were extracted with 250 μl of CHCl3, and the mixture was vortexed and spun briefly. The aqueous phase was washed with CHCl3, and the samples were dried by Speed-Vac. Lipids were separated on silica gel-coated TLC plates. The plates were developed with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (28%), 90:90:7:20. The labeled products were visualized by autoradiography. SDF-1α-treated cells, described above, were lysed in 300 μl of RIPA buffer with 1% sodium deoxycholate. RAFTK was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of lysate using anti-RAFTK antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with RIPA buffer and twice with 1× kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The reaction was carried out in 25 mm HEPES, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate with 100 μg of poly(glutamine-tyrosine) (4:1), 0.8 mm ATP (6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). After 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was terminated with SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3–5 min, and spun briefly to separate the beads. The supernatants were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the labeled products were visualized by autoradiography. The migration experiments were repeated at least three times, with the data shown representative of all results. The data were analyzed for statistical significance using ANOVA (analysis of variance) two factor tests. To investigate inducible expression of the introduced genes, GFP- or nef-GFP-expressing Jurkat T cells were cultured for 2 days in the absence of Tet to induce protein expression. Cell extracts were prepared from the expressing cells and subjected to Western blot analyses with anti-GFP antibody. The blot shows bands corresponding to GFP or the Nef-GFP fusion protein (Fig.1 A). When the membrane was stripped and reprobed for actin, equivalent amounts of protein in each lane were detected (Fig. 1 A). These results confirmed the fidelity of the cell lines and the inducibility of the genes. To exclude the effects of Nef on cytotoxicity in our experiments, cell growth was evaluated during induction of expression of the introduced genes by the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Growth kinetics of the GFP- or nef-GFP expressing cells were similar (Fig.1 B), indicating that Nef was not inhibitory for the cells. The effects of Nef on chemotaxis innef-expressing Jurkat T cells as compared with its effects in the control GFP-expressing cells were assessed by performing cell migration assays, as described above. The Jurkat cells that expressed HIV Nef (Nef-GFP) showed decreased levels of migration in response to SDF-1α in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 C, representative of several experiments). Migration levels never exceeded 8% of the total nef-expressing cells. At 100 ng/ml SDF-1α, control cells expressing GFP showed levels of migration ∼3 times higher than the HIV nef-expressing cells. The difference in migration between the two cell populations was statistically significant (p < 0.05) using an ANOVA two-factor test. The observed Nef-mediated inhibition of Jurkat T cell migration could be due to the down-modulation of CXCR4 expression on the surface of the cells. To investigate this possibility, the level of CD4 expression on the surface of the Jurkat clone was first examined. To this end, expression of GFP or nef-GFP in Jurkat T cells was induced by the removal of Tet, and the Jurkat T cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD4 antibody (Pharmingen). The expression of CD4 was then determined by flow cytometric analysis. We observed that expression of CD4 on the surface of the cells was down-modulated in the presence of Nef but not of GFP, consistent with previous reports (2Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These data indicate that the Nef expressed in the cells was functional. The level of CXCR4 expression on the surface of the Jurkat T cells was then examined. As shown in Fig. 1 D, the entire cell population expressed CXCR4, and the level of expression was not altered by HIV-1 Nef. These results demonstrate that the observed inhibition of T cell migration was not due to down-modulation of CXCR4 expression on the surface of the T cells. To confirm that the inhibitory effect of Nef was not restricted to the Jurkat T cell line, and to further confirm that the cell line would provide a model of pathophysiological effects in primary cells,nef was expressed in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells. To this end, PBMC were obtained from fresh whole blood by density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences), and CD4+ T lymphocytes were then isolated from the activated PBMC, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” CD4+ T lymphocytes were then transduced with various amounts of recombinant virions. Similar to the Jurkat cells, cell viability in the AAV-nef-transduced cells was indistinguishable from that in the GFP-transduced CD4+ T cells, and the surface expression of CXCR4 was not down-modulated by Nef (data not shown). Two days after transduction, cell migration was assayed in the same manner as in the nef-expressing Jurkat cells, except that the migration was for 1 h instead of 3 h. Consistent with the results from the Jurkat T cells, the migration of primary CD4+ T lymphocytes was significantly inhibited in the presence of HIV-1 Nef (Fig. 1 E). This reduction correlated with increasing titers of the AAV construct, indicating that HIV-1 Nef can inhibit the migration of primary peripheral blood CD4+ T cells in response to SDF-1α and that the inhibition was Nef-specific. The inhibition of migration by T cells expressing HIV nef could result from a potential increase in chemokine secretion that would compete with the exogenous ligand in the migration assay. To address this possibility, we assayed cell supernatants for several relevant chemokines, which have been reported to be secreted by macrophages (6Swingler S. Mann A. Jacque J.M. Brichacek B. Sasseville V.G. Williams K. Lackner A.A. Janoff E.N. Wang R. Fisher D. Stevenson M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Neither the control nor HIV nef-expressing cells secreted the cognate ligand, SDF-1α, or the chemokines, MIP-1α and MIP-1β (data not shown). Moreover, they also did not secrete different amounts of IL-2, a cytokine that can alter CXCR4 receptor expression (data not shown). HIV Nef is known to interact with several intracellular signaling molecules, including those that regulate the cytoskeletal apparatus and are relevant to chemotaxis (12Lee C.H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 13Grzesiek S. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Hu J.S. Kaufman J.

Biosci. 2000; 5: D268-D283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined several signaling molecules known to be involved in the SDF-1α signaling pathway. To determine whether there were any differences between the general phosphorylation patterns of the cell lines, cell lysates were Western immunoblotted with the phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies, anti-PY99 and anti-4G10. Several differences in the cell lines with regard to phosphorylation patterns were observed (Fig.2 A). The cells were then examined for changes in phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), a signaling molecule known to be downstream of the CXCR4 receptor and recently reported to be modulated by HIV Nef in primary T cells (21Schrager J.A. der Minassian V. Marsh J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6137-6142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of Nef on ERK activation, SDF-1α-treated cell lysates were incubated with anti-phospho-ERK1/ERK2 antibodies. ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation was detected most strongly in the HIV nef-expressing cells (Fig.2 B, lower panel), with levels several times that of the GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). Protein loading in each lane was determined to be equal by reprobing the membrane with anti-ERK1/ERK2 antibody. To determine whether the changes observed in ERK1/2 activation in the HIV nef-expressing T cells reflected a global activation of multiple signaling pathways or was restricted to specific signaling molecules, we examined the activation status of STAT1 and another member of the MAP kinase family, p38. The SDF-1α-treated cell lysates were probed with anti-phospho-STAT1 antibody. Similar levels of STAT1 phosphorylation were observed for the GFP- and HIVnef-expressing T cells (Fig. 2 C). Similarly, p38 was not differentially activated in the presence of Nef (data not shown). In addition, a recent publication that reported that HIV Nef increased ERK activity in primary T cells, also examined p38 and found it not to be activated by Nef in the same primary T cells (21Schrager J.A. der Minassian V. Marsh J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6137-6142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results supported our data, which suggest specificity with regard to the effects of HIV Nef on intracellular signaling pathways. PI3K is known to play an important role in cell migration. Previous studies (35Stephens L. Ellson C. Hawkins P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 36Hannigan M. Zhan L. Li D. Huang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) have shown PI3K to be an important intracellular regulator of cell migration. Thus, we studied the effect of HIV Nef on PI3K activity in nef-expressing cells as compared with control cells. PI3K activity was assayed as described above. The level of PI3K activity was unchanged in the HIVnef-expressing cells, despite treatment with SDF-1α (Fig.3 A, lower panel). In contrast, control GFP-expressing cells showed the expected increase in PI3K activity in response to SDF-1α treatment (Fig. 3 A,upper panel). Densitometric scanning of this autoradiograph indicated distinct differences in PI3K activity between GFP- andnef-GFP-expressing Jurkat T cells (Fig. 3 B). We next studied RAFTK, a platform kinase that coordinates upstream signals including those from Src kinases, phosphatases, and adapter proteins and transmits the signals downstream to the cytoskeletal apparatus and to transcriptional regulators such as ERK1 and ERK2 (34Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,38Brown A. Wang X. Sawai E. Cheng-Mayer C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9899-9907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RAFTK is known to be an important component of the SDF-1α signaling pathway. Cells were assayed for the enzymatic activity of RAFTK, as described above. The HIV nef-expressing cells were found to have a higher basal level of RAFTK activity than the GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3 C, lower versus upper panel). Furthermore, the kinetics of the enzymatic activity of the HIV nef-expressing cells in response to SDF-1α treatment differed from those of the GFP-expressing cells. Taken together, these data suggest that changes in these kinases might be associated with the Nef-mediated effects on T cell migration. This study is the first to our knowledge indicating that HIV Nef may modulate CD4+ T lymphocyte migration. This effect was observed in both model Jurkat T cells as well as in primary peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes in response to the physiological chemokine SDF-1α. Chemotaxis is an essential component of the immune response, wherein immune cells respond to invading pathogens by moving toward the site of infection along chemokine concentration gradients. This inhibition of cell migration in response to SDF-1α could contribute to HIV disease progression and pathogenicity. Several different hypotheses were entertained with respect to how HIV Nef could abrogate the response to SDF-1α. Because HIV Nef is known to down-modulate important cell surface molecules like CD4 and MHC class I (2Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7Swigut T. Iafrate A.J. Muench J. Kirchhoff F. Skowronski J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we considered whether CXCR4, the receptor for SDF-1α, might also be reduced in expression by Nef. We did not detect down-regulation of CXCR4, indicating that alterations in cognate receptor expression would not explain the abrogated chemotactic response. Similarly, if nef expression caused T cells to produce SDF-1α, then competition at the CXCR4 receptor between exogenous SDF-1α and the Nef-induced chemokine would alter migration. Whereas HIV nef expression has been reported to induce secretion of several chemokines in macrophages (6Swingler S. Mann A. Jacque J.M. Brichacek B. Sasseville V.G. Williams K. Lackner A.A. Janoff E.N. Wang R. Fisher D. Stevenson M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), we did not observe induction of SDF-1α, MIP-1α, or MIP-1β secretion in T cells. It has been reported that peripheral blood T cells need to be activated before they can migrate in response to inflammatory chemokines (39Moser B. Loetscher P. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report (40Ottoson N.C. Pribila J.T. Chan A.S. Shimizu Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) showed that Zap 70 tyrosine kinase, an important signaling molecule for T cell activation, is involved in the migration of human T cells in response to the chemokine, SDF-1α. All of these data suggest that the activation state of T cells can modulate the chemotactic response. In contrast, another study reported that T cell receptor activation does inhibit chemotaxis to SDF-1 in Jurkat cells (41Peacock J.W. Jirik F.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 215-223PubMed Google Scholar), although this was accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity of the cell surface expression of CXCR4. This differs from our data. We do not, however, exclude the possibility that the decreased migration to SDF-1α of the nef-expressing cells may be (partially) related to T cell receptor activation by Nef, because CXCR4 receptor recycling (42Foster R. Kremmer E. Schubel A. Breiffeld D. Kleinschmidt A. Nerl C. Bernhardt G. Lipp M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1522-1531PubMed Google Scholar) may account for the lack of change in CXCR4 expression on the nef-expressing Jurkat cells. Further experiments are required to address the role of activation on migration. The role of Nef in T cell activation is also controversial. One report indicated that HIV-1 Nef induced transcriptional factors that were 97% identical to those observed after stimulation of Jurkat cells (43Simmons A. Aluvihare V. McMichael A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 763-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, other data indicated that Nef alone cannot activate resting T cells, which are manifested by IL-2 secretion from treated cells, but can activate the cells in combination with stimulation through the T cell receptor and the co-stimulus receptor (CD28) (9Schrager J. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 44Wang J.K. Kiyokawa E. Verdin E. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Our data show that HIV Nef did not induce significantly different amounts of IL-2 as compared with the control cells, suggesting that activation by this cytokine did not explain the observed phenomenon. One possible explanation for Nef-mediated inhibition of T cell migration is its effects on intracellular signaling molecules. The different phosphorylation patterns, different basal levels of the enzymatic activities of key intracellular kinases, and their altered kinetics of response to SDF-1α could result in the failure to respond appropriately to the chemotactic stimulus. Such a response requires a highly ordered cascade of intracellular events, specifically, a physiological base line and induced changes in phosphorylation. For example, PI3K, whose lipid phosphorylation products act as second messengers throughout the cell, has been implicated in the activation of complex signaling cascades that mediate chemotaxis, among other cellular functions (34Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies (36Hannigan M. Zhan L. Li D. Huang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3603-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 37Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) indicate that the disruption or removal of PI3K results in the dysregulation of leukocyte chemotaxis. Our data indicate that Nef can inhibit PI3K-mediated signaling cascades, which implies that PI3K may play an important role in Nef-mediated decreases in T cell migration. It is of note that the literature contains conflicting reports on Nef effects on PI3K, with some investigators finding inhibition (46Graziani A. Galimi F. Medico E. Cottone E. Gramaglia D. Boccaccio C. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6590-6593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), as we did, but others observing activation (47Schibeci S.D. Clegg A.O. Biti R.A. Sagawa K. Stewart G.J. Williamson P. AIDS. 2000; 14: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RAFTK kinase activity was also found to be changed in the presence of HIV Nef. The implications of RAFTK dysregulation could be profound, because this molecule signals downstream to the MAP kinase family, particularly ERK1/2 (48Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Prior studies show that alterations in the regulated activation of RAFTK blunt the responses to several chemokines, including SDF-1α (49Dutt P. Wang J.F. Groopman J.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3652-3658PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, alteration of RAFTK kinase activity in the presence of HIV Nef might also contribute to the abrogated T cell response to this chemokine observed in our experiments. In addition, the kinases that we examined are known to affect cytoskeletal arrangement and focal adhesions (45Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 48Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 50Jimenez C. Portela R.A. Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Collard J. Serrano A. Martinez A.C. Avila J. Carrera A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and thus are likely candidates for involvement in the chemotactic changes observed here. The higher basal activation of these kinases in the presence of HIV Nef may indicate a mechanism through which Nef abrogates the response of infected cells to SDF-1α treatment. In causing constitutive activation of kinases in the SDF-1α pathway, HIV Nef may preclude further activation of these kinases from having a significant effect upon the chemotactic response of the cells to SDF-1α treatment. Furthermore, ERK1/ERK2 were differentially phosphorylated in thenef-expressing cell lines versus controls. Changes brought about by the activation of these potent transcriptional regulators could affect the migration of nef-expressing cells by altering the expression of genes whose products are necessary for the chemotactic response. Recently, Schrager et al. (21Schrager J.A. der Minassian V. Marsh J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6137-6142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported specific activation of the ERK/MAP kinase signaling cascade in response to the expression of nef in primary T cells, which supports our findings. In that study, however, chemotaxis was not assessed. The effect of Nef on ERK and thus on gene expression relevant to chemotaxis is a subject for further study. In addition, future experiments will address whether Nef interacts directly with signaling molecules in the CXCR4 pathway or if their activation results from changes in other signaling molecules. Improved understanding of how HIV gene products like Nef may alter key aspects of the immune response, like apoptosis as previously reported, and chemotaxis, as presented in this study, provides the basis for targeted therapeutic interventions in patients with AIDS. Such approaches may augment immune function by restoring physiological responses that are key in host defense. We thank Drs. Hava and Shalom Avraham for providing the RAFTK antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2014609985,"The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are encoded by three genes that yield 10 isoforms through alternative mRNA splicing. The roles of each JNK isoform in the many putative biological responses where the JNK pathway is activated are still unclear. To examine the cellular responses mediated by different JNK isoforms, gain-of-function JNK1 polypeptides were generated by fusing the upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MKK7, with p46JNK1α or p46JNK1β. The MKK7-JNK fusion proteins, which exhibited constitutive activity in 293T cells, were stably expressed in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Swiss 3T3 cells expressing either of the MKK7-JNK polypeptides were equally sensitized to induction of cell death following serum withdrawal. To search for other cellular responses that may be selectively regulated by the JNK1 isoforms, the gene expression profiles of Swiss 3T3 cells expressing MKK7-JNK1α or MKK7-JNK1β were compared with empty vector-transfected control cells. Affymetrix Genechips identified 46 genes for which expression was increased in MKK7-JNK-expressing cells relative to vector control cells. Twenty genes including those for c-Jun, MKP-7, interluekin-1 receptor family member ST2L/ST2, and c-Jun-binding protein were induced similarly by MKK7-JNK1α and MKK7-JNK1β proteins, whereas 13 genes were selectively increased by MKK7-JNK1α and 13 genes were selectively increased by MKK7-JNK1β. The set of genes selectively induced by MKK7-JNK1β included a number of known interferon-stimulated genes (ISG12, ISG15, IGTP, and GTPI). Consistent with these gene expression changes, Swiss 3T3 cells expressing MKK7-JNK1β exhibited increased resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus-induced cell death. These findings reveal evidence for JNK isoform-selective gene regulation and support a role for distinct JNK isoforms in specific cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W2026216171,"In this study, we present evidence for the critical role of proteinase-3 (PR3) in the proliferation of myeloid cells via the proteolytic regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21waf1. Expression of recombinant PR3 in rat (RBL) or human (HMC1) mast cell lines increased bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and CDK2 activity compared with RBL and HMC1 cells transfected with an enzymatically inactive PR3 mutant (PR3(S203A)) or with human neutrophil elastase. Western blot analysis of p21waf1 showed an absence of detectable protein, despite normal levels of p21 mRNA. Ectopic overexpression of p21 restored normal levels of p21 in the RBL/PR3/p21 double transfectants and reverted the proliferative effect of PR3. Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome by lactacystin or of caspases by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone did not inhibit p21 proteolysis. p21 cleavage correlated with PR3 expression in HMC1 cells infected with recombinant adenoviral vector Ad/PR3. During in vitro studies, purified p21 was cleaved by PR3, resulting in a 10-kDa p21 fragment. Employing double immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, subcellular fractionation, and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that PR3 and p21 colocalized in the cytosol. In human neutrophils treated with tumor necrosis factor-α, which induces PR3 re-expression, we observed that p21 disappeared and was reversed by Pefabloc, a serine proteinase inhibitor. The physiopathological implications of the cleavage of p21 by PR3 have to be determined.

The physiopathological implications of the cleavage of p21 by PR3 have to be determined. Myeloid cells express several lineage-specific proteinases in the course of their differentiation and store them in granular pools. As a result, mature phagocytes are equipped with a large assortment of proteinases that play a key role in the noxious potential to pathogens or host tissues (1Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 3503-3521Google Scholar, 2Witko-Sarsat V. Rieu P. Descamps-Latscha B. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 617-654Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a redundancy in serine proteinase activities might be important for mediating various regulatory functions in myeloid cell differentiation as well as in mature phagocytes, including, but not restricted to, microbicidal activity. We also assumed that each serine proteinase could have a unique substrate specificity. Proteinase-3 (PR3) 1The abbreviations used are: PR3, proteinase-3; HNE, human neutrophil elastase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CDKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Boc, t-butoxycarbonyl; Nva, norvaline; SBzl, thiobenzyl; pfu, plaque-forming units; PMN, polymorphonuclear neutrophils; G-CSF, granulocyte colony stimulating factor and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) belong to the myeloid serine proteinase family, which also includes cathepsin G and azurocidin, which are implicated in the destruction of microorganisms and extracellular matrix degradation (3Baggiolini M. Bretz U. Dewald B. Feigenson M.E. Agents Actions. 1978; 8: 3-10Google Scholar). Although PR3 shares the highest sequence homology with HNE (60%) and has a similar substrate specificity, PR3 has some very special properties that are distinct from those of HNE (4Campanelli D. Melchior M. Fu Y. Nakata M. Shuman H. Nathan C. Gabay J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1709-1715Google Scholar). First, the subcellular localization of PR3 is not restricted to the azurophil granule compartment, but its membrane-associated form is also localized in secretory vesicles, thus leading to plasma membrane expression upon very mild neutrophil stimulation (5Witko-Sarsat V. Cramer E.M. Hieblot C. Guichard J. Nusbaum P. Lopez S. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Blood. 1999; 94: 2487-2496Google Scholar). Second, in contrast to all other proteins from azurophil granules whose biosynthesis is restricted to the promyelocytic stage, PR3 mRNA is re-expressed in vitro in both mature neutrophils and monocytes after tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation (6Zhou Z. Richard C. Ménard H.A. J. Rheumatol. 2000; 27: 2406-2411Google Scholar). Moreover, we recently demonstrated that PR3 biosynthesis is induced in vivo in monocytes from children with cystic fibrosis only during episodes of acute pulmonary inflammation (7Just J. Moog-Lutz C. Houzel-Charavel A. Canteloup S. Grimfeld A. Witko-Sarsat V. Cayre Y.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 437-440Google Scholar). Third, aside from its pro-inflammatory activity in mature phagocytes, PR3 has been implicated in autoimmunity and in myeloid progenitor differentiation. PR3 has pathophysiological importance because it is the main target of autoantibodies in Wegener's granulomatosis, a systemic form of necrotizing vasculitis (8Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Ludemann J. Utecht B. Gross W.L. Nature. 1990; 346: 520Google Scholar). In another area of research focusing on myelopoietic mechanisms, PR3 (also termed myeloblastin) was described as a myeloid-specific serine protease (9Bories D. Raynal M.C. Solomon D.H. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cayre Y.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 959-968Google Scholar). PR3 is expressed in human progenitor CD34+ cells at the mRNA and protein levels and appears to be up-regulated by the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (10Lutz P.G. Moog-Lutz C. Coumau-Gatbois E. Kobari L. Di Gioia Y. Cayre Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1601-1606Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that PR3 could act as a protein involved in cell proliferation control and/or apoptosis during myeloid differentiation or in mature neutrophils. In this study, we investigated how PR3 and HNE influence cell proliferation. To differentiate between PR3 and HNE, both expressed in granulocytic cells, stably transfected mast cell lines (the rat basophilic/mast cell line RBL and the human mastocytic cell line HMC1) were used to express either PR3 or HNE. The expression of active recombinant PR3 and HNE has been shown to be tissue-specific and can be achieved only in myeloid cells. Mast cell lines have proven to be valuable models for myeloid-specific proteins and to be lacking endogenous PR3 and HNE (11Specks U. Fass D.N. Fautsch M.P. Hummel A.M. Viss M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 265-270Google Scholar,12Garwicz D. Lindmark A. Hellmark T. Gladh M. Jogi J. Gullberg U. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 113-123Google Scholar). In this respect, investigation of the specific interactions between cell cycle regulatory proteins and myeloid serine proteinases might give some novel mechanisms of cell proliferation and/or apoptosis. Our results provide the first evidence that PR3, but not HNE, promotes cell proliferation via direct proteolytic cleavage of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p21waf1/cip1, which is a potent inhibitor of G1/S transition. In mature neutrophils, p21 was cytoplasmic and was cleaved after TNF-α treatment, which induces PR3 re-expression. This was reversed by a serine proteinase inhibitor. The plasmid pCR/PR3 was a gift from Dr. Pierre G. Lutz (10Lutz P.G. Moog-Lutz C. Coumau-Gatbois E. Kobari L. Di Gioia Y. Cayre Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1601-1606Google Scholar). PR3 cDNA was then subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3/zeo (Invitrogen) between the HindIII and NotI restriction sites. The plasmid pcDNA/PR3(S203A) was prepared to express the enzymatically inactive mutant of PR3 by mutating the serine residue of the catalytic triad (Ser203) to alanine as previously described (11Specks U. Fass D.N. Fautsch M.P. Hummel A.M. Viss M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 265-270Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Clontech). The plasmid pRc/CMV/elastase, containing the cDNA for HNE, was a gift from Dr. Urban Gullberg (Lund University, Lund, Sweden) (13Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson M.A. Nilsson E. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Google Scholar). HNE cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 between the HindIII and NotI restriction sites. The plasmid pET/p21/His, containing the human p21 cDNA with an N-terminal His tag, was a gift from Dr. Bruce Stillman (14Waga S. Hannon J.G. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Google Scholar). All cDNA sequences were confirmed by direct sequencing. The plasmid pcDNA/p21 was a gift from Dr. Bernard Ducommun (15Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Google Scholar). The p21 cDNA was subcloned into pRC/RSV plasmid (Invitrogen) between the HindIII and NotI restriction sites. To construct the adenoviral vector, PR3 cDNA was subcloned into the shuttle vector pDK6 between the EcoRV and NotI restriction sites under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. To obtain a replication-deficient, recombinant adenoviral vector, pDK6/PR3 was cotransfected into 293 cells (CRL 1573, American Type Culture Collection) with plasmid pJM17, containing the adenovirus type 5 genome (Microbix Biosystems), to produce Ad/PR3. Ad/PR3 vectors were propagated, purified, and titered as previously described (16Danel C. Erzurum S.C. Prayssac P. Eissa T. Crystal R.G. Herve P. Baudet B. Mazmanian M. Lemarchand P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1487-1496Google Scholar). The rat basophilic/mast cell line, RBL, was a gift from Dr. Michel Dy (CNRS UMR 8603, Paris). The human mastocytic cell line, HMC1, was a gift from Dr. J. H. Butterfield (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected using the electroporation system (Eurogentec) as described (11Specks U. Fass D.N. Fautsch M.P. Hummel A.M. Viss M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 265-270Google Scholar, 12Garwicz D. Lindmark A. Hellmark T. Gladh M. Jogi J. Gullberg U. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 113-123Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected on the basis on their resistance to Zeocin (1 μg/ml). Stable transfectants were then cloned by limited dilution and selected for high protein expression. For the RBL/PR3/p21 double transfectants, control RBL cells were first transfected with pcDNA/PR3 and selected for 1 month with Zeocin to obtain RBL/PR3 cells. They were then transfected with pRC/RSV/p21 and selected on the basis of a Zeocin and neomycin (1 mg/ml) double resistance. The inhibitors lactacystin and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Calbiochem) were added to the culture as indicated. Human neutrophils were isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated blood from healthy donors by centrifugation on Polymorphprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway), and contaminating erythrocytes were lysed as previously described (5Witko-Sarsat V. Cramer E.M. Hieblot C. Guichard J. Nusbaum P. Lopez S. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Blood. 1999; 94: 2487-2496Google Scholar). Ten milliliter (107 cells) of thrice-washed neutrophils were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The neutrophils were stimulated with human recombinant TNF-α (Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. Neutrophils were harvested after 4 and 15 h by centrifugation. Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C. RBL or HMC1 cells were plated in 96-well plates (5000 cells/well) in the absence or presence of 10% serum and allowed to seed for 24 h in culture. Cell DNA synthesis was measured using a colorimetric immunoassay based on bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation during DNA synthesis. After a 3-h labeling period, incorporated BrdUrd was combined with peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody and then quantified by measuring the absorbance at 340 nm according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RBL or HMC1 cells (100 × 106 cells/ml) were lysed in lysis buffer (0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8) containing proteinase inhibitors (0.5 μm aprotinin (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmleupeptin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1 mmchymostatin (Sigma)). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Pierce). Proteins were analyzed by the standard immunoblot procedure previously described (5Witko-Sarsat V. Cramer E.M. Hieblot C. Guichard J. Nusbaum P. Lopez S. Lesavre P. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Blood. 1999; 94: 2487-2496Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-PR3 (9Bories D. Raynal M.C. Solomon D.H. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cayre Y.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 959-968Google Scholar); mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin A (17McIntyre M. Desdouets C. Senamaud-Beaufort C. Laurent-Winter C. Lamas E. Brechot C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4577-4585Google Scholar); rabbit polyclonal anti-CDK2 and rabbit polyclonal anti-p21 (sc-397) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin E, mouse monoclonal anti-p27, and mouse monoclonal anti-p16 (Pharmingen). The secondary antibody was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and the blot was developed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blot analysis of p21 in neutrophils, cells were suspended in hypotonic buffer (50 mm HEPES) containing proteinase inhibitors (1 μm aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm chymostatin) and sonicated. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain the cytosolic fraction. The protein samples were then analyzed by Western blotting as described above. RBL or HMC1 cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. Protein concentration was adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml. The PR3 or HNE enzymatic activity was evaluated by measuring the hydrolysis of the tripeptide thiobenzyl ester Boc-Ala-Pro-Nva-SBzl (Sigma) in the presence of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) atA 405 nm as previously described (18Witko-Sarsat V. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Schuster A. Nusbaum P. Ueki I. Canteloup S. Lenoir G. Descamps-Latscha B. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 729-736Google Scholar). The procedure for determination of the histone H1 kinase activity was performed as previously described (17McIntyre M. Desdouets C. Senamaud-Beaufort C. Laurent-Winter C. Lamas E. Brechot C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4577-4585Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (HMC1, HMC1/PR3, HMC1/PR3(S203A), and HMC1/HNE) were lysed in lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated for 1 h using mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin A antibody. After adding protein A-Sepharose beads, samples were washed twice with cold lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). For the last wash, 5 μm ATP was added. Reactions were initiated by adding substrate protein (histone H1) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in a final volume of 30 μl. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated histone H1 was then electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to radiographic films at −70 °C. For flow cytometry analysis of the DNA content, HMC1 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. The cells were fixed by addition of 900 μl of 100% ethanol in drop form and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The fixed cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 10 μg/ml DNase-free RNase and 25 μg/ml propidium iodide. DNA fluorescence was measured using a Coulter EPICS Profile II flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser to give 488-nm light. Data from 104 cells were collected, and the percentages of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined by Multicycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems). Total RNA was extracted from HMC1 cells using an RNeasy mini-kit (QIAGEN Inc.), run on a formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel, and transferred onto Hybond-N nylon filters (Amersham Biosciences). The p21 probe was obtained by digesting the pET/p21/His plasmid, containing the human p21 cDNA, with BamHI and NcoI to obtain the full-length p21 cDNA. This p21 probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% Ficoll, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 6.5, 1% glycine, and 500 μg/ml single-stranded DNA. Hybridization was conducted for 15 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 0.04% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.04% Ficoll, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 6.5, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml single-stranded DNA. Filters were washed for 30 min with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by 60 min with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was a PCR product as previously described (10Lutz P.G. Moog-Lutz C. Coumau-Gatbois E. Kobari L. Di Gioia Y. Cayre Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1601-1606Google Scholar) and was used to control the amount of loaded RNA. HMC1 cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/4 ml of medium and infected with Ad/PR3 at various multiplicities of infection from 0 to 500 pfu/cell in the presence of 4 μl of LipofectAMINE (2 mg/ml; Invitrogen). At 72 h post-infection, HMC1 cells were washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were measured, and PR3 and p21 protein were analyzed by Western blotting. Human recombinant p21 was purified from Escherichia coli cells transformed with the expression plasmid pET7/p21/His (14Waga S. Hannon J.G. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Google Scholar). Briefly, growing bacteria were induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 24 h at 30 °C, centrifuged, and lysed. The supernatant was loaded onto an S-Sepharose column and eluted with an NaCl gradient. The p21-positive fractions were then loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, and the p21 was eluted by 150 mm imidazole. PR3 and HNE were purified from granules of human neutrophils as previously described (18Witko-Sarsat V. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Schuster A. Nusbaum P. Ueki I. Canteloup S. Lenoir G. Descamps-Latscha B. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 729-736Google Scholar). The purity of p21, PR3, and HNE was assessed by silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). Purified recombinant p21 (2 μg) and the indicated amount of PR3 or HNE were incubated in PBS, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 100 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After incubation, an aliquot of the reaction mixture (40 μl) was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Subcellular fractionation was performed as previously described (19Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson M.A. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Google Scholar). Briefly, RBL cells resuspended at 108cells/ml in homogenization buffer (0.34 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and 0.3 mm EDTA) containing proteinase inhibitors (0.5 μm aprotinin, 1 mm Pefabloc® (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm chymostatin, and 1 μm leupeptin) were homogenized by 50 strokes with a Thomas potter. The remaining unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was layered on 6 ml of 20% Percoll containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and 0.25 mm sucrose on top of 1 ml of saturated sucrose. Centrifugation was performed at 32,000 × g for 60 min. Three subcellular fractions, including granules, cytosol, and plasma membranes, were then visually identified. Each band was aspirated, resuspended in PBS, and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 2 h. The pellet obtained after the first centrifugation was treated with 0.3% Nonidet P-40 to lyse the residual unbroken cells and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. This fraction was solubilized with lysis buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g to obtain a nuclear fraction. Each fraction was solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 and adjusted to a 2 mg/ml protein concentration to measure β-hexosaminidase and PR3 enzymatic activities. β-Hexosaminidase activity, taken as a marker of the granular fraction, was measured using p-nitrophenylN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide as substrate as previously described (20Hultberg B. Lindsten J. Sjöblad S. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 599-605Google Scholar). PR3 enzymatic activity was measured using the chromogenic substrate Boc-Ala-Pro-Nva-SBzl. An aliquot of each fraction was boiled in reduced Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of PR3 and p21 as described above. p21 and PR3 subcellular localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence in control RBL and RBL/PR3 cells, respectively. Cells were cytocentrifuged, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and made permeable with PBS and 1% Triton X-100. Free binding sites were saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin solution for 15 min. Cells were incubated with the primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-p21 (Pharmingen), or mouse monoclonal anti-PR3 (CLB12.8) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and incubated with the secondary antibody (rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse, respectively). Slides were washed with PBS and mounted in Fluoroprep. Cells were examined with a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope using Leica narrow-range filters (fluorescein isothiocyanate selective L4, rhodamine filter N2.1, blue/green/red). For colocalization experiments, p21 and PR3 double labeling was performed in RBL/PR3(S203A) cells. p21 labeling was performed first, followed by PR3 labeling. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. Neutrophils were cytocentrifuged, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with PBS and 1% Triton X-100. Immunostaining was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Dako) using mouse monoclonal anti-p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation of PR3 using rabbit polyclonal anti-p21 antibody (sc-397) was performed using the μMACS system as indicated by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec, Paris, France). Briefly, RBL/PR3(S203A) cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with 1 μm leupeptin and 1 mm chymostatin for 20 min on ice. The cell lysate (800 μl) was incubated with 2 μg of either rabbit polyclonal anti-p21 antibody (sc-397) or control IgG and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose magnetic microbeads. After mixing, the lysate was incubated for 30 min on ice. For magnetic immunoprecipitation, the lysate was applied to a microcolumn placed in the field of a magnetic separator. The microcolumn was washed with 4 × 200 μl of lysis buffer and rinsed with 600 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. For elution, 60 μl of 2× nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer were added. The samples (exclusion, lavage, and elution) were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. PR3 was detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-PR3 antibody (1:2000), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000). Co-immunoprecipitation of CDK2 and p21 was performed using the same technique: immunoprecipitation of CDK2 using rabbit polyclonal anti-CDK2 antibody and analysis of the immunoprecipitated material by Western blotting using anti-p21 antibody. The direct impact of PR3 on cell proliferation was assessed using mast cell lines transfected with PR3 cDNA. Following a 1-month selection period, RBL and HMC1 cells transfected with PR3 cDNA showed increased proliferation capacity compared with controls transfected solely with the plasmid pcDNA. BrdUrd incorporation was significantly increased in RBL/PR3 and HMC1/PR3 cells compared with RBL/pcDNA and HMC1/pcDNA cells, respectively (Fig.1 A). Moreover, this increase in BrdUrd incorporation was much more pronounced when cells were tested in the absence of serum (Fig. 1 A). The use of an inactive PR3 mutant allowed us to further define whether PR3 serine protease activity is required for the induction of cell proliferation. This mutant (PR3(S203A)) was obtained by mutation of serine 203, which belongs to the catalytic triad, to alanine (11Specks U. Fass D.N. Fautsch M.P. Hummel A.M. Viss M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 265-270Google Scholar). This mutation abolished the effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, RBL and HMC1 cells transfected with HNE showed no increase in cell proliferation. Western blot analysis provided evidence that recombinant PR3 and PR3(S203A) are expressed at similar levels in both RBL and HMC1 cells (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the level of PR3 expression was five times less than that obtained in control human neutrophils, thus providing evidence that there is no PR3 overexpression in RBL/PR3 or HMC1/PR3 cells. Measurement of serine proteinase activity using the chromogenic substrate Boc-Ala-Pro-Nva-SBzl confirmed that no serine proteinase activity was present in cells transfected with the inactive PR3(S203A) mutant, whereas a high level of serine proteinase was measured in RBL/PR3 and HMC1/PR3 cells as well as in RBL/HNE and HMC1/HNE cells (Fig.1 C). From this set of experiments, we concluded that the increase in cell proliferation observed in PR3-transfected cells requires PR3 serine proteinase activity. Western blot analysis of cyclin A showed that it appeared as a doublet in control HMC1, HMC1/PR3, HMC1/PR3(S203A), and HMC1/HNE cells with a molecular mass of 60 and 55 kDa. No difference in cyclin A expression was observed in any of the transfectants (Fig.2 A). Likewise, Western blot analysis of cyclin E and CDK2 expression showed no striking difference in any of the transfectants. However, a significant increase in CDK2 activity in HMC1/PR3 cells compared with control HMC1, HMC1/PR3(S203A), and HMC1/HNE cells was observed, thereby corroborating the increase in DNA synthesis and the increase in cells in S phase (Fig. 2 B). Flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle was performed in HMC1 cells maintained in the absence of serum for 24 h. The results of cell cycle analysis are consistent with the results of BrdUrd incorporation and CDK2 activity, showing a significant increase in DNA synthesis in PR3-transfected cells, with 63.0% of the cells in S phase compared with 50.6, 50.4, and 45.5% in control HMC1, HMC1/PR3(S203A), and HMC1/HNE cells, respectively (Fig. 2 C). However, the percentage of HMC1/PR3 cells in S phase did not increase in the same proportion as the increase in BrdUrd incorporation, thereby suggesting that the cells that proliferated were no longer in S phase. We next sought to elucidate the mechanisms through which PR3 stimulates cell proliferation and facilitates G1/S transition. The cell cycle is negatively regulated by a series of CDKIs that fall into two classes: the INK4 family (p15, p16, p18, and p19) and the p21 family (p21waf1, p27kip1, and p57kip2) (21Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Google Scholar). p21 and p27 share a similar domain involved in CDK and cyclin binding (22Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Google Scholar), and both have been shown to mediate growth arrest when overexpressed (23Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Google Scholar, 24Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 79: 59-66Google Scholar), to contribute to restriction point G1 arrest (25Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Google Scholar, 26Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberst J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Google Scholar), and to be regulated in myeloid differentiation (27Steinman R.A. Huang J. Yaroslavskiy B. Goff J.P. Ball E.D. Nguyen A. Blood. 1998; 91: 4531-4542Google Scholar). We first analyzed the status of CDKIs, including p16, p27, and p21. Western blotting using anti-p21 antibody clearly showed an absence of detectable p21 in PR3-transfected cells in both RBL and HMC1 cells, whereas p21 remained present at a constant level in all other transfectants, including control/pcDNA, PR3(S203A), and HNE (Fig. 3 A). We found no difference in either p27, another member of the KIP family, or p16, a member of the INK family. In addition, under stress conditions such as serum withdrawal, p21 was also absent in PR3-transfected cells (Fig.3 B). Northern blot analysis using the human p21 probe demonstrated the presence of p21 mRNA in PR3-transfected cells as well as in all HMC1 transfectants (Fig. 3 B), thus indicating that PR3 induction of proliferation proceeds via a post-transcri"
https://openalex.org/W1972529347,"As a cell biologist, I am very discouraged by the nature of the ongoing debate on the introduction of genetically modified (GM) plants into the marketplace. This discussion has usually pitted irrational emotional arguments against the apparently rational notion that genetic engineering is just like traditional plant breeding, only more specific. In particular, I believe that insufficient attention has been paid to three important issues: first, introduction of the same gene into two different types of cells can produce two very distinct protein molecules; second, the introduction of any gene, whether from a different or the same species, usually significantly changes overall gene expression and therefore the phenotype of the recipient cell; and third, enzymatic pathways introduced to synthesize small molecules, such as vitamins, could interact with endogenous pathways to produce novel molecules. The potential consequence of all of these perturbations could be the biosynthesis of molecules that are toxic, allergenic, or carcinogenic. And there is no a priori way of predicting the outcome. In what follows I outline these concerns and argue that GM food is not a safe option, given our current lack of understanding of the consequences of recombinant technology."
https://openalex.org/W1997907891,"Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins contain an RGS domain that inhibits Gα signaling by activating Gα GTPase activity. Certain RGS proteins also contain a Gγ-like (GGL) domain and a poorly characterized but conserved N-terminal region. We assessed the functions of these subregions in theCaenorhabditis elegans RGS proteins EGL-10 and EAT-16, which selectively inhibit GOA-1 (Gαo) and EGL-30 (Gαq), respectively. Using transgenes in C. elegans, we expressed EGL-10, EAT-16, their subregions, or EGL-10/EAT-16 chimeras. The chimeras showed that the GGL/RGS region of either protein can act on either GOA-1 or EGL-30 and that a key factor determining Gα target selectivity is the manner in which the N-terminal and GGL/RGS regions are linked. We also found that coexpressing N-terminal and GGL/RGS fragments of EGL-10 gave full EGL-10 activity, whereas either fragment alone gave little activity. Biochemical analysis showed that coexpressing the two fragments caused both to increase in abundance and also caused the GGL/RGS fragment to move to the membrane, where the N-terminal fragment is localized. By coimmunoprecipitation, we found that the N-terminal fragment complexes with the C-terminal fragment and its associated Gβ subunit, GPB-2. We conclude that the N-terminal region directs inhibition of Gα signaling by forming a complex with the GGL/RGS region and affecting its stability, membrane localization, and Gα target specificity. Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins contain an RGS domain that inhibits Gα signaling by activating Gα GTPase activity. Certain RGS proteins also contain a Gγ-like (GGL) domain and a poorly characterized but conserved N-terminal region.

We conclude that the N-terminal region directs inhibition of Gα signaling by forming a complex with the GGL/RGS region and affecting its stability, membrane localization, and Gα target specificity. Many hormones and neurotransmitters bind and activate heptahelical transmembrane receptors, which in turn catalyze exchange of bound GDP for GTP on G protein α subunits. GTP binding induces dissociation of Gα from Gβγ subunits and enables these activated proteins to signal downstream effectors. Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) 1The abbreviations used are: RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; GGL, Gγ-like; DEP, Dishevelled/EGL-10/pleckstrin homology; RGS-N, conserved N-terminal region found in GGL-containing RGS proteins; EAT-N, -L, and -C, N-terminal, linker, and C-terminal region of EAT-16, respectively; EGL-N, -L, and -C, N-terminal, linker, and C-terminal region of EGL-10, respectively; FL-N, FLAG epitope-tagged EGL-10 N-terminal fragment; HA, hemagglutinin; HA-C, HA epitope-tagged EGL-10 C-terminal fragment proteins help terminate signaling by greatly enhancing the weak intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα proteins, thus driving reassembly of the inactive, GDP-bound Gαβγ heterotrimer (1Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Google Scholar). All RGS proteins contain a ∼120-amino acid region known as the RGS domain that contacts Gα subunits and functions as the GTPase activation domain (2Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Google Scholar). To date, more than 20 mammalian RGS proteins and about 20 mammalian Gα proteins have been identified (1Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Google Scholar). Although RGS proteins have been extensively studied in vitroand by overexpression in cultured cells, their in vivo Gα targets and physiological functions remain largely unclear. For example, the RGS proteins RGS4 and GAIP act similarly on both Gαi and Gαo in vitro (3Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Google Scholar) but show strong and opposing selectivity between these targets when assayed in cultured chick sensory neurons (4Diversé-Pierluissi M.A. Fischer T. Jordan J.D. Schiff M. Ortiz D.F. Farquhar M.G. De Vries L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14490-14494Google Scholar). However, when overexpressed in HEK293 cells, both RGS proteins acted similarly to block Gαi signaling (5Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6159-6163Google Scholar). Another dilemma is illustrated by the fact that the RGS2 protein shows different preferences for Gαi versus Gαq, depending on the specific in vitro assay system used (6Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Google Scholar, 7Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Google Scholar). An additional complication arises from the fact that many studies have been carried out on small RGS domain-containing fragments of RGS proteins. RGS proteins typically contain additional conserved regions outside the RGS domain that appear to affect their functions and target specificities (1Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Google Scholar). Genetic studies have the potential to conclusively demonstrate the true physiological functions and Gα target specificities of RGS proteins. To date, only a few RGS proteins have been genetically characterized. A mouse knockout of RGS9 shows that it functions in the retina to limit the duration of visual signaling (8Chen C.-K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Google Scholar). RGS9 is the only abundant RGS protein in rod outer segments (9He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Google Scholar), which also contain only one Gα protein, the visual G protein Gαt. Thus, the selectivity of the RGS-Gα interaction in this case appears to be a relatively simple issue. A more complex, and probably more typical, case is revealed by genetic studies of the Caenorhabditis elegansRGS proteins EGL-10 and EAT-16. Although both are widely expressed in the nervous system, they select different Gα targets and thus have opposite effects on C. elegans behavior (Fig.1 C). Genetic experiments have shown that EGL-10 inhibits signaling by the C. elegans Gαo homolog GOA-1, which in turn inhibits C. elegans egg-laying behavior (10Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Google Scholar). EAT-16, on the other hand, inhibits signaling by the C. elegans Gαq homolog EGL-30, which in turn activates egg-laying behavior (11Hajdu-Cronin Y.M. Chen W.J. Patikoglou G. Koelle M.R. Sternberg P.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1780-1793Google Scholar). EGL-10 and EAT-16 constitute the clearest example of RGS proteins that have been shown through rigorous genetic experiments to have distinct Gα target specificities. EGL-10 and EAT-16 are members of a subfamily of RGS proteins that includes RGS9 as well as the mammalian RGS6, RGS7, and RGS11 proteins. Just N-terminal to their RGS domains, these proteins contain a ∼60-amino acid Gγ-like (GGL) domain (Fig. 1, A andB) that mediates binding to a divergent Gβ subunit, Gβ5 (12Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.-F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Google Scholar). The exact role of Gβ5 in signaling is unclear, but genetic and molecular studies in C. elegans show that EGL-10 and EAT-16 require association with the C. elegans Gβ5 ortholog, GPB-2, for their stability and function (13Chase D.L. Patikoglou G.A. Koelle M.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 222-231Google Scholar). All GGL-containing RGS proteins also contain a conserved N-terminal region of ∼220 amino acids (Fig.1 A) that has been termed the RGS-N domain (9He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Google Scholar). The significance of this region is indicated by its extraordinary conservation (e.g. 69% identity, comparing EGL-10 and RGS7; Fig. 1 B). The function of the RGS-N region is not clearly understood. It contains an 80–100-amino acid subregion known as the DEP domain, named for its weak sequence similarity (10–19% identity), comparing theDishevelled, EGL-10, and pleckstrin proteins (14Ponting C.P. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 245-246Google Scholar). Two studies analyzed the stimulation of Gαt GTPase activity by N-terminal truncation mutants of RGS9 deleted for the RGS-N region. One study saw little effect of the RGS-N region (15He W. Lu L. Zhang X. El-Hodiri H.M. Chen C.-K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Google Scholar). The other (16Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Google Scholar), using a different method of kinetic analysis, found that the RGS-N region contributed to the ability of RGS9 to act preferentially on Gαt when Gαtis complexed with the γ subunit of its effector, phosphodiesterase. Recent studies of RGS9 have also shown that its RGS-N region binds an anchoring protein that tethers it to the membrane (17Lishko P.V. Martemyanov K.A. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24376-24381Google Scholar, 18Hu G. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9755-9760Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the RGS-N regions of EGL-10 and EAT-16 contribute to the functions and distinct Gα target specificities of these RGS proteins in vivo. Using EGL-10/EAT-16 chimeras, we found that the manner in which the RGS-N and GGL/RGS regions are linked influences whether Gαo or Gαq is selected for inhibition. Most intriguingly, we found that the RGS-N region can direct Gα inhibition by the GGL/RGS region even when these regions are expressed as separate polypeptides. This observation can be explained by our finding that the RGS-N region directly or indirectly binds to the GGL/RGS region and its associated Gβ subunit GPB-2, and the complex thus formed appears to be the functional unit that acts on Gα targets in vivo. A 2.2-kbPstI/PflMI fragment of the rgs-1promoter (19Dong M.-Q. Chase D. Patikoglou G.A. Koelle M.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2003-2014Google Scholar) was inserted into pPD49.26 (20Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Google Scholar) to construct pGP3, a vector that directs expression of inserted open reading frames in all neurons of C. elegans. cDNA fragments coding full-length EGL-10 or EAT-16 were inserted into pGP3 to generate plasmids pGP4 and pMK340, respectively. Conserved protein subregions were identified in alignments of EGL-10 and EAT-16 with each other and their human homologs (Fig. 1 B), and cDNA fragments coding some of these regions were inserted into pGP3. For expression of C-terminal fragments of EGL-10 or EAT-16, an artificial AUG codon was added to initiate translation. The extents of the EGL-10 subregions, the names designating them, and the corresponding expression plasmids were as follows: residues 1–223, EGL-N, pGP39; residues 224–334, EGL-L (not expressed individually); and residues 335–555, EGL-C, pGP40. The subregions, designations, and plasmids for EAT-16 were as follows: residues 1–201, EAT-N, pGP51; residues 202–211, EAT-L (not expressed individually); and residues 212–473, EAT-C, pGP52. An alternative EGL-N fragment, consisting of residues 1–243 of EGL-10, was also tested: it behaved in all respects like the smaller 223-residue EGL-N fragment (data not shown). The FL-N construct pGP91 was made by adding sequences encoding DYKDDDDKDYKDDDDK (containing two FLAG tags) immediately after the initiating AUG codon of the EGL-N construct pGP39. Similarly, the HA-C construct pGP92 was made by adding sequences encoding GYPYDVPDYAGYPYDVPDYA (containing two HA tags) after the AUG codon of the EGL-C construct pGP40. Derivatives of pGP3 were also constructed to express EGL-10/EAT-16 chimeras composed of the N, L, and C subregions described above. The chimeras used and the corresponding expression plasmids were as follows: EGL-N/EGL-L/EAT-C, pGP55; EGL-N/EAT-L/EAT-C, pGP58; EGL-N/EAT-L/EGL-C, pGP59. Test plasmids were coinjected with a marker plasmid into the gonad of C. elegans to generate extrachromosomal transgene arrays (20Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Google Scholar). Animals from transgenic lines were recognized among the F2 progeny because they showed the phenotype induced by the marker plasmid. Rescue of egl-10 was tested by injection into animals of genotype egl-10(md176); lin-15(n765). The lin-15 rescuing plasmid pL15EK (11Hajdu-Cronin Y.M. Chen W.J. Patikoglou G. Koelle M.R. Sternberg P.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1780-1793Google Scholar) was coinjected at 50 ng/μl as the marker. Rescue of eat-16was tested by injection into animals of genotypeeat-16(ad702), and the marker plasmid pRF4 (20Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Google Scholar), which induces a dominant Rol phenotype, was coinjected at 80 ng/μl as the marker. To test for dominant negative effects, injections were intolin-15(n765) animals carrying no RGS mutations, and pL15EK was used as the marker plasmid. Each RGS expression plasmid tested was injected at 80 ng/μl, and pGP3 (empty vector) DNA was included in certain injections so that the total expression plasmid DNA concentration was identical for every injection. Extrachromosomal transgenes expressing FLAG- and HA epitope-tagged EGL-10 fragments were chromosomally integrated by irradiating transgenic animals with γ-rays. The resulting strains were outcrossed to egl-10(md176); lin-15(n765) animals at least two times to produce clean genetic backgrounds. The integrated FL-N and HA-C transgenes shown in this work have the allele designationsvsIs20 and vsIs18, respectively.vsIs18 male animals were mated to vsIs20hermaphrodites, and the resulting cross-progeny were allowed to self-fertilize to produce animals homozygous for both vsIs20and vsIs18. The genotypes of all of these strains were verified by PCR amplification of the transgenes. Unlaid eggs were counted by dissolving adult animals in bleach and counting the bleach-resistant fertilized eggs under a microscope (10Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Google Scholar). All assays were on animals selected as late L4 larvae and aged at 20 °C for 30 h to produce precisely staged adults. For each extrachromosomal transgene analyzed, at least 50 animals were assayed (≥10 animals from at least five independent transgenic lines). For integrated transgenes, ≥30 animals were assayed. In certain cases, we also carried out a second egg-laying assay in which the developmental stages of freshly laid eggs were determined (10Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Google Scholar). In each case, this verified that the transgenes affected egg-laying behavior, not egg production, indicating that the transgenes generated normal EGL-10 and EAT-16 activities (data not shown). Worm strains carrying theegl-10(md176) null mutation as well as the integrated transgene vsIs18 and/or vsIs20 were grown in liquid culture at 20 °C as mixed stage populations. Worms were purified by flotation on 30% sucrose and transferred to lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors, and, in certain experiments, 1% Triton X-100). Lysis was by three passages through a French press followed by 60 s of sonication with a microtip probe (Fisher model 550 sonic dismembrator). Debris and unlysed worms were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm in a clinical centrifuge. The resulting “total lysates” were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis. When required, total lysates were fractionated into soluble and pellet fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 30 min. To assess the levels of FLAG- and HA-tagged proteins in total lysates (see Fig. 6), 50 and 160 μg of total protein, respectively, were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. We further analyzed total lysates by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Sucrose gradients were formed by successively overlaying a 49% (w/v) sucrose cushion with equal volumes of 20% sucrose and total lysate. Centrifugation was carried out in a TLS-55 swinging bucket rotor at 55,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. Twelve equal volume fractions were collected, with fraction 1 at the top and fraction 12 (including any pellet fraction) at the bottom. The results shown in Figs. 6 and 7 are representative of those obtained in multiple trials carried out with independently prepared lysates.Figure 7Solubility and effect of detergent on HA-C and FL-N expressed in transgenic animals. A, total worm lysates (T), soluble fractions generated as supernatants from 100,000 × g centrifugation of the same lysates (S), and the insoluble pellet fractions (P) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and immunoblotted with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. This experiment was conducted either in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 in the lysis buffer. The HA-C protein was largely soluble when expressed alone but moved almost entirely to the pellet when coexpressed with the FL-N protein. In contrast, the distribution of the FL-N protein remained unchanged in the presence or absence of the HA-C protein, remaining predominantly in the pellet fraction. The use of 1% Triton resulted in significant solubilization of both the HA-C and FL-N proteins.B, sucrose density gradient fractionation of total lysates prepared in the absence of detergent from worms carrying integrated transgenes expressing HA-C and FL-N. The bulk of these proteins floated in fractions 8 and 9, as did endogenous membrane-associated GOA-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The primary antibodies used to probe Western blots were as follows: mouse anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma); rat anti-HA high affinity (3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals); mouse anti-β-tubulin (E7; developed by Michael Klymkowsky and obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences); rabbit anti-GPB-2 (13Chase D.L. Patikoglou G.A. Koelle M.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 222-231Google Scholar); and rabbit anti-GOA-1 (13Chase D.L. Patikoglou G.A. Koelle M.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 222-231Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse (Bio-Rad), goat anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad), or goat anti-rat (Pierce). Protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence detection reagents (Pierce) and Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax MR film. The proteins studied had mobilities on SDS-PAGE analysis approximately as follows: HA-C, 28 kDa; FL-N, 32 kDa; β-tubulin, 55 kDa; GPB-2 isoforms, 42 and 44 kDa; and GOA-1, 40 kDa. Soluble fractions of extracts made in lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100 were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies coupled to agarose beads (Sigma), tumbling for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and pelleted by centrifugation. Proteins bound to the pelleted beads were eluted in 100 mm glycine, pH 3.5, for 5 min with gentle shaking at room temperature and neutralized with a 10% elution volume of 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.4, 1.5 mNaCl. The results shown in Fig. 8 are representative of those obtained in at least three trials. EGL-10 and EAT-16 have precisely opposite mutant phenotypes, because EGL-10 specifically inhibits Gαo and EAT-16 specifically inhibits Gαq. In principle, these RGS proteins might achieve such specificity by being expressed in different cells that also express different Gα proteins. Alternatively, the RGS and Gα proteins might all be found in the same cells, but each RGS protein could have the ability to selectively act on only one of the Gα targets available to it. This latter possibility is supported by the observation that both RGS and both Gα proteins are expressed in all of the neurons of C. elegans, although each RGS and Gα protein is also additionally expressed in muscle cells that may differ for each protein (10Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Google Scholar, 11Hajdu-Cronin Y.M. Chen W.J. Patikoglou G. Koelle M.R. Sternberg P.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1780-1793Google Scholar,21Ségalat L. Elkes D.A. Kaplan J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1648-1651Google Scholar, 22Mendel J.E. Korswagen H.C. Liu K.S. Hajdu-Cronin Y.M. Simon M.I. Plasterk R.H. Sternberg P.W.

To distinguish between these alternative models, we constructed transgenes in which the same promoter was used to direct expression of either the EGL-10 or the EAT-16 cDNA. We used the rgs-1promoter, which is active in all neurons of C. elegans but in no other cells (19Dong M.-Q. Chase D. Patikoglou G.A. Koelle M.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2003-2014Google Scholar). The constructs were transformed into egl-10 or eat-16 null mutants and tested for their ability to rescue the opposite defects in egg-laying behavior seen in the two mutants. egl-10 mutants are lethargic in their egg-laying behavior and thus accumulate excess unlaid eggs compared with control animals (Fig. 2, compare A andB). Transgenic expression of EGL-10 rescued theegl-10 egg-laying defect (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, expression of EAT-16 from the same heterologous promoter did not affect the egl-10 mutant (Fig. 2 D). We quantitated our results by counting the number of unlaid eggs retained inside animals carrying the different transgenes (Fig. 2 E). Theegl-10 transgene rescued the egl-10 defect fully and even resulted in slightly hyperactive egg laying, seen as a decrease in the accumulation of unlaid eggs relative to the wild-type control (Fig. 2 E, compare bars 1 and3). Overexpressing EGL-10 has previously been shown to cause a gain-of-function effect that results in hyperactive egg laying (10Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Google Scholar). The EAT-16 protein had no detectable EGL-10 activity, since expression of EAT-16 did not reduce the accumulation of unlaid eggs (Fig.2 E, bar 4). eat-16 mutants are hyperactive in their egg-laying behavior (11Hajdu-Cronin Y.M. Chen W.J. Patikoglou G. Koelle M.R. Sternberg P.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1780-1793Google Scholar). Whereas wild-type animals retain their fertilized eggs for 2 h or more before laying them,eat-16 mutants lay their eggs very soon after fertilization, resulting in a decreased accumulation of unlaid eggs (Fig.2 F, compare bars 1 and 2). Transgenic expression of EAT-16 resulted in substantial rescue of theeat-16 egg-laying defect (Fig. 2 F, bar 4), whereas expression of EGL-10 using the same promoter resulted in no detectable rescue of the eat-16 defect (Fig.2 F, bar 3). The rescue resulting from EAT-16 expression may have been incomplete either due to insufficient levels of expression from the heterologous promoter or because EAT-16 expression may be required outside of the nervous system to achieve full rescue. These experiments demonstrate that, even when expressed from the same heterologous promoter, EGL-10 and EAT-16 have opposite effects on egg laying. Neural expression of either RGS protein can fully (EGL-10) or substantially (EAT-16) rescue loss of endogenous expression of the same RGS protein but cannot rescue loss of the other RGS protein at all. We conclude that EGL-10 and EAT-16 have distinct effects on egg laying due to distinct properties of these RGS proteins themselves and that any small differences in their endogenous expression patterns do not account for their different functions. We tested the ability of subregions of EGL-10 and EAT-16 to function in vivo. The fact that the linker between the RGS-N region and the C-terminal GGL/RGS region is variable in length and sequence among different RGS proteins (Fig.1 B) suggested that a precise attachment between these two regions may not be required and encouraged us to try expressing the two regions as separate polypeptides in transgenic animals to test for their function. The same neuron-specific promoter used above for expressing full-length RGS proteins was also used to express the protein subfragments. In addition, we tested coexpression of these fragments by cotransforming expression constructs for each. The expression constructs were transformed into egl-10 oreat-16 null mutants and tested for their ability to rescue the egg-laying defects of these mutants. The constructs were also transformed into animals with no RGS mutations to test for dominant-negative effects on egg laying. Experiments in which protein fragments are expressed suffer from the problem that such fragments may not be properly folded or stable, making negative results difficult to interpret. We set a stringent criterion for dealing with this issue: we do not present or interpret results from constructs that give only negative results. However, if a construct gives strong rescuing activity in one experiment, we do interpret negative results it may give in other experiments, because the positive result demonstrates that the construct successfully expresses an active protein fragment. Fig. 3 A shows the effects of EGL-10 fragment expression in an egl-10 null mutant background. We refer to the N- and C-terminal fragments of EGL-10 (indicated in Fig. 1 A) as EGL-N and EGL-C, respectively. Expression of either EGL-N or EGL-C only weakly rescued theegl-10 egg-laying defect (Fig. 3 A,bars 3 and 4). Surprisingly, coexpression of both fragments gave full rescue of theegl-10 mutant (Fig. 3 A, bar 5), equivalent to the strong rescue previously seen by expressing full-length EGL-10 (Fig. 2 E, bar 3). This result demonstrates that EGL-N and EGL-C act together to inhibit Gαo signaling and that EGL-N need not be covalently attached to EGL-C for full EGL-10 function. We tested the EGL-10 fragments for EAT-16 activity by expressing them in the eat-16 null mutant but found that neither fragment nor the combination of both showed much activity (Fig. 3 B). We also tested the EGL-10 fragments in a background carrying no RGS mutations to test the fragments for dominant negative effects (Fig.3 C). Interference with endogenous EGL-10 function would be seen as an increased accumulation of unlaid eggs. Expression of EGL-N alone (Fig. 3 C, bar 2) gave a result similar to the control (bar 1). Expression of EGL-C alone or coexpression of EGL-C and EGL-N also did not show dominant negative effects. Rather, expression of these fragments resulted in small decreases in the accumulation of unlaid eggs (Fig.3 C, bars 3 and 4), showing that these constructs gave positive EGL-10 activity, just as they did in the egl-10 mutant background (Fig. 3 A,bars 4 and 5). We also tested constructs expressing N- and C-terminal fragments of EAT-16 (termed EAT-N and EAT-C, respectively) in egl-10,eat-16, and wild-type RGS backgrounds. Neither fragment nor the combination of both showed strong effects in any background tested (data not shown). According to our criterion for interpretability outlined above, we therefore do not interpret these experiments. Although we know that EAT-C is active (see below), EAT-N may simply not be folded or stable. To identify the regions of EGL-10 and EAT-16 responsible for their distinct Gα target specificities, we generated transgenes to express EGL-10/EAT-16 chimeras, transformed them into egl-10 and eat-16 null mutants, and tested for their ability to rescue the egg-laying defects of these mutants. In these experiments, we hoped to identify discrete protein subregion(s) that determine EGL-10 activity versus EAT-16 activity. Our first strategy for generating chimeras was based on the observation that the N- and C-terminal fragments of EGL-10, when coexpressed, give full EGL-10 function. We coexpressed combinations of N- and C-terminal fragments from EGL-10 and EAT-16 to see if these combinations, which we term “noncovalent chimeras,” could give EGL-10 or EAT-16 function. We found that coexpression of the EGL-N fragment with the C-terminal GGL/RGS fragment of EAT-16 (EAT-C) gave full EGL-10 function. As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of either fragment alone in an egl-10 null background gave little rescue of the egl-10 egg-laying defect (bars 3 and 4). When coexpressed, however, the EGL-N and EAT-C fragments fully rescued theegl-10 mutant (bar 5). Indeed, the number of unlaid eggs in the animals coexpressing the fragments was below that of the wild-type control (bar 1), indicating that animals coexpressing EGL-N and EAT-C have excess EGL-10 activity and thus are slightly hyperactive for egg laying. Expression of EGL-N, EAT-C, or both gave no rescue of the eat-16egg-laying defect (Fig. 4 B, bars 3–5), showing that these fragments have no detectableeat-16 activity. We also c"

Cyst formation, or encystation, is considered one of the most primitive adaptive responses developed by eukaryotes early in evolution and crucial for the transmission of the parasite among susceptible hosts. During this process, proteins that will assemble into the extracellular cyst wall (CWP1 and CWP2) are transported to the cell surface within encystation-specific secretory vesicles (ESVs) by a developmentally regulated secretory pathway. Cyst wall proteins (CWPs) are maintained as a dense material inside the ESVs, but after exocytosis, they form the fibrillar matrix of the cyst wall. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in granule biogenesis and discharge in Giardia, as well as the assembly of the extracellular wall. In this work, we provide evidences that a novel 54-kDa protein that exclusively localizes to the ESVs is induced during encystation similar to CWPs, proteolytically processed during granule maturation, and able to bind calcium in vitro.

This parasitic organism has a simple life cycle, alternating between the disease-causing trophozoite and the environmentally resistant cyst, which is responsible for the transmission of the disease among susceptible hosts. After the reception of the stimulus that triggers encystation, G. lamblia undergoes several metabolic and morphologic changes. These comprise the synthesis, processing, and transport of leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins that will be finally secreted and assembled at the cell exterior to form a protective cyst wall (1Lujan H.D.

From their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 cyst wall proteins (CWPs) must be transported to the cell membrane in a very effective and controlled manner because the survival of the parasite outside the intestine of the host depends on the success of this process (3Gillin F.D.

Unfortunately, the knowledge of the transport machinery inGiardia is limited, mostly due to the fact that trophozoites lack essential secretory organelles, such as morphologically identifiable Golgi apparatus and secretory granules (4Feely D.E.

Today. 1997; 14: 446-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (29) Google Scholar). During encystation, expression of molecules implicated in the regulated secretory pathway increases several times, and this distinctive characteristic can be use to identify and characterize developmentally regulated molecules (1Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 2Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 14: 446-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In previous works, using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) generated against purified cyst walls, two proteins that localize within ESVs in encysting trophozoites and to the cyst wall of mature cysts were identified and characterized (CWP1 and CWP2) (9Lujan H.D.

Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). CWP1 and CWP2 are acidic proteins of 26 and 39 kDa, respectively, that contain typical eukaryotic signal peptides and five tandem copies of leucine-rich repeats and form a stable complex between them, likely mediated by disulfide bonds (1Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Besides CWPs, several other molecules that are similarly induced during encystation are known to participate in the intracellular transport and secretion of cyst wall materials: chaperones such as BiP/GRP78 (19Lujan H.D.

It is known that a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration is necessary to induce regulated secretion in higher eukaryotes (24Arvan P. Castle J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 327-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,25Smith S.J. Augustine G.J. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 458-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Calcium-induced aggregation of secretory proteins has been proposed to be necessary for sorting and storage of secretory proteins into secretory granules of endocrine and exocrine cells (26Gerdes H.H. Rosa P. Phillips E. Bauerle P.A. Frank R. Argos P. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12009-12015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since secretory granules contain large amounts of Ca2+, calcium function has also been attributed to the packaging and processing of the contents of the secretory granule (27Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The presence of calcium-binding proteins along the secretory pathway is thought to be necessary for the temporal control of signaling processes acting as Ca2+ buffers or Ca2+-sequestering proteins (27Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Yuasa K. Maeshima M.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1775-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the role of calcium and secretory granule calcium-binding proteins during the biogenesis of secretory granules and regulated secretion remains unclear. In this work, using two different mAbs generated against purified secretory granules of encysting Giardia trophozoites, we identified a novel acidic protein of 54 kDa (gGSP for G. lamblia granule-specific protein), which localizes to the lumen of ESVs, is proteolytically cleaved before cyst wall formation, and is able to bind calcium. In addition, inhibition of gGSP expression blocks cyst wall formation, suggesting that this secretory granule protein is essential for calcium-mediated exocytosis during encystation of this important human pathogen. Trophozoites of the isolate WB clone 1267 (30Nash T.E. Aggarwal A. Adam R.D. Conrad J.T. Merritt J.W. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 636-641PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 10% adult bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml bovine bile (growth medium) as described (31Keister D.B. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1983; 77: 487-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Encystation of trophozoite was accomplished by the method described by Boucher and Gillin (32Boucher S.E. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trophozoites were recovered from the medium, and cysts were collected and resuspended in tap water (32Boucher S.E. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mature cysts were counted in a Coulter Z1 cell counter. ESVs were purified essentially as described (9Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The biochemical characterization of the granule fractions was done by immunoreactivity with the mAb specific for CWPs as an indication of the secretory granule enrichment, by acid phosphatase activity as an indication of lysosomal contamination, and by immunoreactivity with the mAb 9C9 (specific for BiP) as an indication of ER contamination (19Lujan H.D.

Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against purified ESVs were produced by standard procedures as described previously (9Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants of antibody-secreting hybridomas were screened for specific reactivity with ESVs of encysting trophozoites by indirect immunofluorescence assays. Two antibodies, mAbs 7E7 (IgG2a) and 9C3 (IgG1), that bind specifically to Giardia secretory granules (see below) were purified from ascites and labeled as reported (9Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Proteins were incubated in sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol and fractionated by SDS-PAGE in 4–12% gradient gels. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose was performed as reported (9Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol.

Filters were blocked with 3% defatted milk/0.1% Tween/Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with mAbs (1:1000 dilution). Following incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgGs at 1:2000 dilution, Giardia proteins were visualized by development with alkaline phosphatase color development reagent (Bio-Rad). In particular experiments, alkaline phosphatase-labeled mAbs were used. Cells cultured in grown medium, pre-encystation medium, or encystation medium were harvested and processed as described previously (9Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol.

The specimens were mounted and viewed on a Leica IRME fluorescence microscope, and images were captured with the Leica DC250 camera and processed with the Leica QFluoro Software (Leica Microsystems). Purified ESVs were dissolved in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1.0% Triton X-114 at 0 °C and subjected to detergent and aqueous phase partitioning as described previously (33Bordier C. J.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive clones were purified, and the reactivity of the fusion proteins was verified by immunoblotting using mAbs 7E7 and 9C3. The cDNA inserts from three clones 30, 37 (mAbs 7E7), and 41 (mAb 9C3) were amplified by PCR using primers flanking the cloning site of the λ vector, cloned, and sequenced. For Southern hybridization, 10 μg of G. lamblia genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI, Sau3AI, and HindIII. Both Southern and Northern hybridizations were performed as reported previously (9Lujan H.D.

Homology searches and other structural predictions were performed with software available at ExPASy (www.expasy.ch/). Trophozoites induced to encyst for 24 h (6 × 108 cells) were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer as reported (9Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol.

To investigate the Ca2+ binding capability of the different forms of gGSP, polyacrylamide gels after non-reduced SDS-PAGE were stained with Stains-all (27Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 37Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. Jorgensen A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, immunoprecipitated gGSP was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) using a Bio-Rad slot blot apparatus and subjected to 45Ca2+overlay assays as described (27Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For gGSP functional analysis, sense primer Gf (5′-GTTGATATCATGTTGCGGAAGTTTCGGTCATTC-3′) containing an EcoRV site and Gr antisense primer (5′-GGACCATGGTATTATTTCTATGGTCAGTTTTAT-3′) with aNcoI site (restriction sites in boldface) were used to amplify by PCR the entire gsp open reading frame. The 1374-bp band was purified, restricted, and cloned into the vector PtubH7HApac (23Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Lujan H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this way, the gsp gene was inserted inside Ptub-HApac inversely, giving the gsp antisense vector that was used for the inhibition of gGSP expression. As a control, the same vector was used to express an HA-tagged version of gGSP, resulting in PtubGSPHApac. Sequences were confirmed by dye terminator cycle sequencing (Beckman Coulter). Transfection of G. lambliatrophozoites was done by electroporation as described previously (23Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Lujan H.D. J.

Singer S.M. Pierce J. Cowan J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Western and Northern blotting was used to analyze gGSP and CWP2 expression. The mAbs 7E7 and 9C3 were generated using purified encystation-specific secretory vesicles (ESVs) as immunogen (Ref. 9Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar and Supplementary Fig. 1) and using hybridomas screened for reactivity to ESVs of encysting trophozoites. An immunoblotting assay showed that mAb 9C3 recognizes 54- and 30-kDa polypeptides in encysting trophozoites (Fig. 1), whereas mAb 7E7 only recognizes a 30-kDa protein (Supplementary Fig. 2). The expression of such proteins was not observed in non-encysting or pre-encysting cells, but their expression level increases during encystation in vitrocoincident with the expression of Giardia cyst wall proteins (Supplementary Fig. 2). When mAbs 7E7 or 9C3 were used in immunofluorescence analysis, they labeled ESVs of encysting trophozoites (Fig. 2 A). In contrast to antibodies that recognize CWP2 (mAb 7D2), mAb 7E7 and 9C3 did not label the cyst wall (Fig. 2 B), indicating that they detect ESV-specific antigens. Additional evidence that CWPs and this novel antigen colocalize to ESVs comes from the almost exact localization pattern observed for both polypeptides in fractions obtained after sucrose isopycnic centrifugation of the 30,000 ×g particulate fraction of encysting Giardia (Fig. 2 C). The fact that those proteins were present only in secretory granules prompted us to analyze whether they were soluble or membrane-associated. ESVs were purified from 24-h encystingGiardia and proteins subjected to a detergent and aqueous phase separation using Triton X-114. Results showed that those proteins partition to the aqueous phase and therefore are not part of the ESV membrane (Supplementary Fig. 3).Figure 2Monoclonal antibody 9C3 detects proteins in secretory granules of encysting trophozoites but not in cyst wall. Immunofluorescence images of encysting trophozoites encysted for 24 h (A) and cyst (B). Fluorescein-conjugated mAb 7D2 (specific for CWP2) and rhodamine-conjugated mAb 9C3 (specific for gGSP) were used. In thecenter panel of A, the merged image shows the identical localization of CWP2 and gGSP to secretory granules of encysting trophozoites. Similar results were always observed with mAb 7E7.

Positive clones were purified, and the resultant fusion proteins were verified by immunoblotting using the same mAbs. The cDNA inserts from three clones, 30, 37 (mAbs 7E7), and 41 (mAb 9C3), were amplified and sequenced (Fig3). Analysis of these sequences demonstrated the presence of common regions in clones 30 and 37 (Fig. 3). Additionally, Southern blot experiments using the inserts present in clones 30 and 41 showed identical hybridization patterns (Fig. 4), indicating that they could be fragments of the same gene. To address this issue, PCR and screening of a gDNA library from Giardia isolate WB clone 1267 (9Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol.

Like almost all Giardiagenes, gGSP lacks introns (38Adam R.D. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 39Dittié A. Thomas L. Thomas G. Tooze S.A.

Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Google Scholar). Its counterpart in vertebrates, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, is critical in many aspects of development. Inappropriate activation of Wnt-induced genes that are normally precisely regulated can lead to diverse types of human cancer (reviewed in Ref. 2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which Wnt signals are held in check are therefore critical both to normal development and to human disease. Genetic and molecular analyses have identified evolutionarily conserved proteins that transmit the Wnt/β-catenin signal. Upon binding of Wnt to frizzled family receptors, Dsh or its mammalian homologs (Dvl) become hyperphosphorylated (3Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Google Scholar, 4Lee J.S. Ishimoto A. Yanagawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21464-21470Google Scholar). In cells that are not exposed to Wnt, a multiprotein complex promotes phosphorylation and degradation of armadillo (Arm)/β-catenin via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (5Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Google Scholar). The complex includes the proteins Zw3/GSK3, adenomatous polyposis coli, axin, and Arm/β-catenin. Upon Wnt reception, Dsh transmits a signal that inhibits the activity of the complex, thereby allowing hypophosphorylated Arm/β-catenin to accumulate by escaping the degradation machinery. Arm/β-catenin then translocates to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of Wnt target genes through its association with transcription factors of the Lef/Tcf family (6Brunner E. Peter O. Schweizer L. Basler K. Nature. 1997; 385: 829-833Google Scholar,7van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Mortin M. Clevers H. Cell. 1997; 88: 789-799Google Scholar). In addition to Wnt/β-catenin signaling, Dsh functions in a distinct signal transduction pathway that mediates planar cell polarity (8Bray S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R155-R158Google Scholar). This pathway coordinates epithelial morphogenesis in fly and vertebrate development, and involves proteins downstream of Dsh that are distinct from the Wnt/β-catenin pathway proteins. Several Dsh-binding proteins have been identified. In Wnt/β-catenin signaling, Dsh/Dvl was proposed to contact the Arm/β-catenin degradation complex via a direct association with two GSK3-interacting proteins, axin and Frat1 (9Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr 3rd, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Google Scholar). Upon exposure to Wnt, the Dsh·axin·Frat·GSK3 complex dissociates, which may cause Arm/β-catenin accumulation (9Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr 3rd, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Google Scholar). Biochemical purification of Dsh kinases from Drosophila cell extracts led to the identification of CKII and PAR-1 as additional binding partners of Dsh (10Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Google Scholar, 11Sun T.Q. Lu B. Feng J.J. Reinhard C. Jan Y.N. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 628-636Google Scholar). CKII also interacts with the Dvl proteins in mammalian cells (12Song D.H. Sussman D.J. Seldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23790-23797Google Scholar). CKII and PAR-1 are able to phosphorylate Dsh/Dvl. Studies using Xenopus andCaenorhabditis elegans showed that the CKI family of protein kinases are positive effectors of Wnt signaling (13Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Google Scholar, 14Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Google Scholar, 15McKay R.M. Peters J.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 388-396Google Scholar). They can phosphorylate Dsh and directly interact with the Dsh PDZ domain. Three additional proteins, PP2Cα, Idax, and Stbm, associate with the PDZ domain of Dvl (16Strovel E.T. Wu D. Sussman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2399-2403Google Scholar, 17Hino S. Kishida S. Michiue T. Fukui A. Sakamoto I. Takada S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 330-342Google Scholar, 18Park M. Moon R.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 20-25Google Scholar). PP2Cα also interacts with axin and activates Wnt signaling by dephosphorylating axin (16Strovel E.T. Wu D. Sussman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2399-2403Google Scholar). In contrast, Idax and Stbm are negative regulators of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (17Hino S. Kishida S. Michiue T. Fukui A. Sakamoto I. Takada S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 330-342Google Scholar,18Park M. Moon R.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 20-25Google Scholar). The roles of Wg and its signal transduction system have been particularly well studied in the context of Drosophilaembryonic segmentation (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Google Scholar). We previously reported the identification of the segment polarity gene nkd and showed that Nkd acts in a negative feedback loop to restrict Wg activity in the embryo (19Zeng W. Wharton Jr., K.A. Mack J.A. Wang K. Gadbaw M. Suyama K. Klein P.S. Scott M.P. Nature. 2000; 403: 789-795Google Scholar). Nkd acts at the level of Dsh through a direct interaction with the central region of Dsh that includes a sequence rich in basic residues and the adjacent PDZ domain (20Rousset R. Mack J.A. Wharton Jr., K.A. Axelrod J.D. Cadigan K.M. Fish M.P. Nusse R. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 658-671Google Scholar). Nkd is a novel protein that includes a single putative Ca2+binding motif of the EF-hand family. The activities of many EF-hand proteins are sensitive to, and regulated by, changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (reviewed in Ref. 21Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Google Scholar). We and others recently described vertebrate EF-hand-containing proteins related toDrosophila Nkd that also bind Dsh/Dvl proteins and can block Wnt signals (22Wharton Jr., K.A. Zimmermann G. Rousset R. Scott M.P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 93-106Google Scholar, 23Yan D. Wallingford J.B. Sun T.Q. Nelson A.M. Sakanaka C. Reinhard C. Harland R.M. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3802-3807Google Scholar). The conservation of the EF-hand motif in fly and vertebrate Nkd proteins suggests a role for Ca2+ or other divalent cations in Nkd-mediated regulation of Wnt pathway activity. To test this hypothesis, we defined domains in Drosophila Nkd responsible for binding Dsh and antagonizing Wg signaling, and we investigated the possible role of divalent cations in the interaction between the two proteins. The nkd plasmids used for the yeast two-hybrid assay were constructed using pAS2 or pAS2–1 vectors (Clontech). The deletion mutants were generated either by restriction digestion using convenient restriction sites within the nkd cDNA, or by PCR. They correspond to: aa 293–928 (pAS2-nkd BamC), aa 1–178 (pAS2-1-nkd NR1), aa 1–294 (pAS2-nkd NBam), aa 177–372 (pAS2-1-nkd R1S), aa 177–294 (pAS2-1-nkd EFXY), aa 177–253 (pAS2-1-nkd EFX), aa 177–226 (pAS2-1-nkd EF), aa 227–253 (pAS2-1-nkd X), and aa 227–372 (pAS2-1-nkd XS). PCR fragments containing the point mutations D201A and D213V were inserted into the internal EcoRI/BamHI sites of the pAS2-1-nkd plasmid. The wild-type dsh cDNA was subcloned into the pACT2 vector (Clontech). For the GST pull-down assays, both wild-type and mutant nkd constructs (see above) were inserted into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), except for the nkd R1S fragment, which was subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmids pBluescript IIKS(+)-dshmyc and pGEX-4T-2-dshG6 have been described elsewhere (3Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Google Scholar, 10Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Google Scholar). We used the plasmids pBluescript IIKS(+)-nkdmyc containing wild-type or mutant (D210A or D213V) constructs for in vitro translation. To generate the GST-bRecoverin fusion protein used in the45Ca-blotting assay, the open reading frame encoding the bovine recoverin protein was amplified by PCR and inserted into pGEX-4T-1. The plasmid pGEX-4T-2-Pmr1 EF was a generous gift from Dr. R. Rao (24Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Google Scholar). To make pGEX-4T-1-CiZn, a DNA fragment corresponding to aa 458–637 of Ci was obtained by PCR and inserted into pGEX-4T-1. All the constructs were verified by sequencing. Transformation of the yeast strain PJ69-4A (25James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar) was performed using a variation of the lithium acetate method (Clontech). Yeast growth assay was achieved using the ADE reporter gene present in the strain and medium containing or lacking adenine. In this system, an interaction between two protein domains being tested is indicated by growth in the absence of adenine because of the expression of the reporter gene. As a control, growth was also tested in the presence of adenine. Growth was evaluated between 3 and 4 days at 30 °C. β-Galactosidase activity (using the LacZ reporter gene also present in the strain) was measured as described by Clontech. Bacterial lysates containing the GST fusion proteins were prepared as described by Amersham Biosciences, except MTPBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mmNa2HPO4, 2.5 mmKH2PO4), containing 1 mm Pefabloc SC, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and an antiprotease mixture, was used instead of phosphate-buffered saline. The lysates were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 30 min at room temperature and washed four times, twice with MTPBS, 1% Triton X-100 buffer and twice with DT80 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 80 mm KCl, 0.25% Triton X-100). The beads were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the latter buffer (containing 1 mm Pefabloc SC and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with [35S]methionine-labeled Nkd or Dsh proteins, which were produced using the TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The beads were washed four times with DT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.25% Triton X-100, containing 80, 150, or 300 mm KCl) and incubated with SDS-PAGE-loading buffer to elute the proteins. Samples were run on SDS protein gels, which were then dried and exposed on BioMax film (Kodak) or a PhosphorScreen (Amersham Biosciences). For the experiments corresponding to Figs. 3 and 4, GST pull-down assays were performed as described above, with the following modifications. In Fig. 3, EDTA alone, EGTA alone, EDTA + MgCl2, or EDTA + LiCl were added to each buffer at the indicated concentrations. For the experiments in Fig. 4, GST-Nkd R1S, once bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, was washed twice for 5 min with MTPBS, 1% Triton X-100 buffer containing 100 mmEDTA and twice with DT80 buffer containing ZnCl2, CaCl2, or MgCl2 at the indicated concentrations. The subsequent steps (incubation with Dsh and final washes) were also performed in the presence of ZnCl2, CaCl2, or MgCl2 at the same concentrations. Calculation of Kd values and free concentration of EDTA was performed using WEBMAXC v2.10 program (www.stanford.edu/∼cpatton/maxc.html) with the following values: temperature = 4 °C, pH 8.0, and ionic strength = 0.1.Figure 4Zn2+-dependent interaction between Nkd and Dsh. A, EDTA wash of GST-Nkd R1S is sufficient to impair its association with35S-Dsh. EDTA was only used in this initial wash, and not during the next steps of the assay (see “Experimental Procedures”).B, addition of 40 μm ZnCl2 during the incubation with Dsh restores the interaction. In contrast, addition of CaCl2 (C) or MgCl2 (D) has no effect, even at 50 or 500 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fly transformations and culture were performed according to standard methods. For the rescue assay, a third chromosome P(mini w+, da-Gal4) insert was recombined onto a nkd 7E89 chromosome and balanced over TM3. For each experiment in Table I, da-Gal4, nkd 7E89 /TM3 females were crossed toUAS-X/UAS-X; nkd 7H16 /TM3 (where X is each mutant Nkd protein) males at 25 °C, and embryos were scored according to previously described criteria (19Zeng W. Wharton Jr., K.A. Mack J.A. Wang K. Gadbaw M. Suyama K. Klein P.S. Scott M.P. Nature. 2000; 403: 789-795Google Scholar). Constructs NIN3 (aa 1–447), NBam, and EFX were tagged with a C-terminal GFP to determine relative accumulation in tissues. Cuticle preparations were performed as previously described (19Zeng W. Wharton Jr., K.A. Mack J.A. Wang K. Gadbaw M. Suyama K. Klein P.S. Scott M.P. Nature. 2000; 403: 789-795Google Scholar) and images were collected by darkfield microscopy on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. For the overexpression assay, B119-Gal4 (on II) or A8-Gal4 (on X) females were crossed to chromosome II or III UAS-X/UAS-X orbalancer males at 29 °C, and progeny were scored on a Leica MZ12.5 dissecting scope and photographed using a Nikon Coolpix camera. For sternite bristle counts, all bristles in abdominal segments A2–A6 of gravid females were counted.Table IGenetic rescue of nkd7H16/nkd7E89cuticle phenotype by wild-type and mutant Nkd proteinsGrossPercent of embryosnWild-typeWeakModerateStrong1.da-Gal4, nkd7E89/TM3 X UAS-lacZ; nkd7H16/TM32197400262. da-Gal4, nkd7E89/TM3 X UAS-Nkd; nkd7H16/TM3181990013. da-Gal4, nkd7E89/TM3 X UAS-NIN3; nkd7H16/TM323273<115114. da-Gal4, nkd7E89/TM3 X UAS-NBam; nkd7H16/TM31987800225. da-Gal4, nkd7E89/TM3 X UAS-NR1; nkd7H16/TM31607600246. da-Gal4, nkd7E89/TM3 X UAS-R1S; nkd7H16/TM31057900217. da-Gal4, nkd7E89/TM3 X UAS-EFX; nkd7H16/TM3707900218. da-Gal4, nkd7E89/TM3 X UAS-Nkd-D201A; nkd7H16/TM3251>99<100 Open table in a new tab The45Ca-blotting assay was performed as described (26Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Google Scholar). Five μg of GST fusion proteins, purified as specified above, were loaded on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred without SDS onto a nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h 15 min at 120 V (4 °C). As a loading control, an identical gel was run in parallel and stained with Coomassie Blue. The membrane was washed for 1 h at room temperature with KMI buffer (60 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8). The incubation with 45CaCl2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was then performed in the same buffer for 10 min at a concentration of 1 μCi/ml in 10 ml. The membrane was washed for 5 min in distilled water, dried, and exposed on BioMax film (Kodak). For the45Ca-blotting assay performed in the presence of Zn2+ (data not shown), 50 or 500 μmZnCl2 was added to KMI buffer. We performed the65Zn-blotting assay as previously reported (27Mazen A. Gradwohl G. de Murcia G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 39-42Google Scholar). Five μg of GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The reduced proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h at 100 V (4 °C). The blot was washed for 1 h with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and subsequently incubated for 15 min in 10 ml of TK buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl) containing 5 μCi of65ZnCl2. The membrane was then washed twice for 15 min with TK buffer, dried, and exposed on BioMax film (Kodak). Dsh contains three conserved domains: DIX (also present in axin), PDZ, and DEP. Nkd interacts with the central region of Dsh that includes a basic sequence and the PDZ domain (20Rousset R. Mack J.A. Wharton Jr., K.A. Axelrod J.D. Cadigan K.M. Fish M.P. Nusse R. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 658-671Google Scholar). In Nkd, the EFX domain, a 66-amino acid region conserved between fly and vertebrate Nkd is sufficient to bind Dsh in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1A; Ref. 22Wharton Jr., K.A. Zimmermann G. Rousset R. Scott M.P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 93-106Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of the EF-hand, we tested DrosophilaNkd deletion mutants in two different Dsh-binding assays, the yeast two-hybrid and the GST pull-down. Mutant Nkd proteins that lack the EF-hand do not interact with Dsh (constructs BamC, NR1, and X), or only interact weakly (construct XS), indicating that the putative Ca2+ binding motif of Nkd is important for the association (Fig. 1). However, the EF-hand alone (construct EF) does not bind Dsh (Fig. 1). In the GST pull-down assay, the interaction between the Nkd EFX domain and Dsh is not as robust as the interaction between full-length Nkd and Dsh (Fig. 1B), indicating that regions in Nkd other than EFX may contribute to the association with Dsh. The XS fragment by itself binds weakly to Dsh, but the interaction becomes as strong as the full-length Nkd protein when fragment XS is adjacent to the EF-hand (R1S construct; Fig. 1B). Thus the EF-hand and the XS fragment cooperate in the full-strength association with Dsh. The R1S domain is also able to bind the central basic/PDZ region of Dsh (data not shown). To determine which regions of Nkd are important for biological activity, we constructed transgenic flies capable of misexpressing mutant Nkd proteins. The da-Gal4 driver was used to induce ubiquitous expression in strong classnkd 7H16 /nkd 7E89 embryos. Misexpression of full-length nkd cDNA rescued all or nearly all mutant cuticles to wild-type morphology (Fig. 2A and TableI). Construct NIN3, a C-terminal deletion that includes the EF-hand and the adjacent XS region (see Fig. 1C), partially rescued the cuticle abnormalities innkd mutant embryos (Fig. 2B and Table I). In contrast, constructs NBam, R1S, NR1, and EFX had no activity in the rescue assay (Fig. 2, C and D; Table I). Cuticle rescue is a stringent assay for nkd function that may not reveal partial activities of deleted Nkd proteins, perhaps because of the narrow temporal requirement for nkd activity in the early embryo (19Zeng W. Wharton Jr., K.A. Mack J.A. Wang K. Gadbaw M. Suyama K. Klein P.S. Scott M.P. Nature. 2000; 403: 789-795Google Scholar, 28Dougan S. DiNardo S. Nature. 1992; 360: 347-350Google Scholar). When nkd expression is driven post-embryonically in otherwise wild-type animals, a variety of adult phenotypes that mimic loss of the wg gene arise, including wing to notum transformations and loss of halteres and sternite bristles (19Zeng W. Wharton Jr., K.A. Mack J.A. Wang K. Gadbaw M. Suyama K. Klein P.S. Scott M.P. Nature. 2000; 403: 789-795Google Scholar). To further explore the activity of the mutant Nkd proteins, they were produced in the pupal abdomen usingB119-Gal4 and the progeny were scored for the loss of sternite bristles. Production of full-length Nkd resulted in near total loss of sternite bristles with occasional residual laterally displaced bristles (Fig. 2E and TableII; Ref. 19Zeng W. Wharton Jr., K.A. Mack J.A. Wang K. Gadbaw M. Suyama K. Klein P.S. Scott M.P. Nature. 2000; 403: 789-795Google Scholar). Construct NIN3 induced intermediate bristle phenotypes, typically resulting in loss of half of the bristles depending on the transgenic line used (Fig. 2Fand Table II). Construct NBam, including the EFX domain but lacking the adjacent Dsh association sequence, produced adults with largely normal bristle patterns and adults with subtle bristle pattern abnormalities, most commonly loss of hemisternite bristle clusters (Fig. 2G). Construct NR1 did not result in a loss of bristles; indeed three of five transgenic lines appeared to have increased numbers of bristles (Table II). To confirm the differential activities of NIN3, NBam, and NR1, a more ubiquitous driver, A8-Gal4, was used. Misexpression of NIN3 or NBam gives rise to pharate adults that fail to hatch, with small wings, short legs, and sternite bristle abnormalities, indicating that these constructs can antagonize Wg signaling when expressed at sufficient levels and duration (data not shown). In contrast, NR1 does not result in any wg-like phenotypes or pharate lethality. In a manner similar to NBam, construct R1S induced subtle bristle abnormalities when crossed toB119-Gal4, and pharate lethality when crossed toA8-Gal4, whereas EFX did not produce any adult phenotypes with B119-Gal4 or A8-Gal4 (data not shown). This differential activity between Nkd R1S and Nkd EFX indicates that the region C-terminal of the EF-hand that is necessary for full interaction with Dsh is important for Nkd activity. Taken together, the in vivo data show that the Dsh association sequences deduced from our binding studies contribute to Nkd function, but regions further N- and C-terminal must also be important for full Nkd activity (see summary Table in Fig. 1C).Table IIB119-Gal4-induced sternite bristle loss by mutant Nkd proteinsGenotypeNo. transgenic linesMean No. bristles/flyS.D.UAS-Nkd20052.4UAS-NIN345510126397329UAS-NBam4899835817925UAS-NR1579796714311976826UAS-R1S4794833863892UAS-EFX3993883902UAS-GFP1843 Open table in a new tab The ability of EF-hand motifs to bind Ca2+, and sometimes Mg2+, is well established (21Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Google Scholar, 29Andersson M. Malmendal A. Linse S. Ivarsson I. Forsen S. Svensson L.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1139-1147Google Scholar, 30Gribenko A.V. Makhatadze G.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 679-694Google Scholar). We investigated the potential role of ions in the Nkd-Dsh interaction. Chelators of divalent cations were tested for their effects on the Nkd-Dsh association, using the GST pull-down assay. In the presence of the divalent cation chelator EDTA, full-length GST-Nkd or GST-Nkd R1S fusion proteins lost their ability to bind Dsh (Fig. 3A), indicating that EDTA titrated a cofactor essential for binding. GST-Nkd R1S was chosen for further biochemical study because it binds Dsh as strongly as full-length GST-Nkd (Fig. 1) and its production in bacteria is more efficient (data not shown). The minimal concentration of EDTA required to completely abolish the Nkd-Dsh interaction was 40 mm (data not shown) and was employed in the following experiments. As a control, increasing concentrations of divalent ions were used to presaturate EDTA and specifically inhibit its effect. The experiment shown in Fig. 3B was performed with MgCl2, but similar results were obtained with CaCl2 or ZnCl2 (data not shown). 40 mm MgCl2 restored the interaction to the control level (Fig. 3B). With lower concentrations of MgCl2 that did not fully saturate EDTA, there was a corresponding decrease in the amount of Dsh bound to Nkd (data not shown). In contrast, 40 mm LiCl, which contributes monovalent ions unable to bind EDTA, did not inhibit the effect of EDTA (Fig. 3B). Thus the action of EDTA is specific and likely because of chelation of divalent ions needed for the Nkd-Dsh interaction. Another chelator, EGTA, was tested. In contrast to EDTA, EGTA had no effect on the Nkd-Dsh interaction, even at concentrations as high as 100 mm (Fig. 3C). Therefore EGTA cannot titrate away the divalent ion(s) required for the interaction of Nkd with Dsh, possibly because of a weaker affinity for the ion(s). Under our assay conditions, dissociation constants (Kd) of EDTA and EGTA for Ca2+ are quite similar (4 × 10−9 and 5 × 10−9; see “Experimental Procedures” for calculation), suggesting that Ca2+ is not the divalent ion necessary for the interaction. Mg2+ and Zn2+, however, are good candidates, as EDTA has 4–5 orders of magnitude higher affinity for Mg2+ and Zn2+than does EGTA: for Mg2+, Kd (EDTA) is 9 × 10−7 and Kd (EGTA) is 4 × 10−3; for Zn2+, Kd(EDTA) is 7 × 10−15 and Kd(EGTA) is 1 × 10−10. GST pull-down assays were employed to identify divalent ion(s) necessary for the interaction between Nkd and Dsh. Instead of using EDTA throughout the experiment as above, we used it only to wash GST-Nkd R1S bound to Sepharose beads prior to its incubation with Dsh in the presence of a variety of divalent cations. If no divalent ion is added during the incubation with Dsh, the interaction between the two proteins is greatly diminished (Fig. 4A; compare with Fig. 1A). Dsh is at no point exposed to an ion-free solution, and encounters only residual EDTA if any. This result strongly suggests that EDTA inhibits the interaction by affecting Nkd and not Dsh. The addition of 40 μmZnCl2 reestablished the association (Fig. 4B), whereas addition of CaCl2 or MgCl2, even at high concentrations, had no effect (Fig. 4, C andD). Therefore Zn2+, but not Ca2+ or Mg2+, can stimulate the Nkd-Dsh association in vitro. Other divalent ions of the transition metal series can substitute for Zn2+ in Zn2+-binding proteins (31Vallee B.L. Galdes A. Adv. Enzymol. 1984; 56: 283-430Google Scholar). Cu2+, Cd2+, and Co2+ compete for Zn2+ binding to superoxide dismutase or carbonic anhydrase, whereas Fe2+ and Mn2+ are poor competitors (32Schiff L.A. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4195-4199Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, Cu2+, Cd2+, Co2+, as well as Ni2+, restored the Nkd-Dsh association, whereas Fe2+ and Mn2+ had no effect (data not shown). The EF-hand motifs adopt a helix-loop-helix structure and bind Ca2+ via consensus amino acid residues present in the loop (21Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Google Scholar, 33Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Google Scholar). Key residues that coordinate Ca2+ correspond to loop positions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 12 and are often oxygen-donating residues such as Asp, Glu, and Asn. In some EF-hand domains, natural substitutions of loop residues have occurred that preclude ion binding. For example, in recoverin, a protein with four EF-hands, only EF2 and EF3 bind Ca2+, whereas EF1 and EF4 have loop residue substitutions that prevent Ca2+ binding (33Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Google Scholar). Both fly and vertebrate Nkd EF-hands possess consensus loop residues compatible with ion binding (for alignment, see Refs. 19Zeng W.

https://openalex.org/W2035944695,"Infections with bacteria that contain hydrolytic β-lactamase enzymes are becoming a serious problem in the United States. Mutations at Met-69, an amino acid proximal to the active site Ser-70 in the TEM-1 and SHV-1 β-lactamases, have emerged as a puzzling cause of bacterial resistance to inhibitors of β-lactamases. Site-saturation mutagenesis of the 69 position in SHV β-lactamase was performed to determine how mutations of this non-catalytic residue play a role in increasing 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 concentrations) for clinically important β-lactamase enzyme inhibitors. Two distinct phenotypes are evident in the variant β-lactamases studied: significantly increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (μg/ml) and IC50concentrations to clavulanic acid for the Met69Ile, Leu, and Val substitutions, and unanticipated increased minimum inhibitory concentrations and hydrolytic activity toward ceftazidime, an advanced generation cephalosporin antibiotic, for the Met69Lys, Tyr- and Phe-substituted enzymes. Molecular modeling studies emphasize the conserved structure of these substitutions despite great variation in substrate specificity. This study demonstrates the key role of Met-69 in defining substrate specificity of SHV β-lactamases and alerts us to new phenotypes that may emerge clinically. Infections with bacteria that contain hydrolytic β-lactamase enzymes are becoming a serious problem in the United States.

This study demonstrates the key role of Met-69 in defining substrate specificity of SHV β-lactamases and alerts us to new phenotypes that may emerge clinically. β-lactamases are serine hydrolases that act upon β-lactam antibiotics (Fig. 1), and thus prevent these drugs from interfering with cell wall synthesis in many types of bacteria. β-Lactamase production is the most important mechanism by which pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria become resistant to β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins (see Fig. 2). TEM-1 β-lactamase, first described in ampicillin-resistantEscherichia coli, is the most common plasmid-borne resistance enzyme in Class A (E.C.3.5.2.6). SHV β-lactamases are related to TEM in structure and function (64% homology) and are usually found β-lactam-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Some mutations have arisen in these enzymes under the selective pressure of antibiotic use, resulting in variants that are able to destroy or evade our most sophisticated drugs, including β-lactam-based “suicide inhibitors” like clavulanic acid (Fig.2) (1Charnas R.L. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3214-3219Google Scholar). To date, 26 such inhibitor-resistant variants have been described including TEM and SHV enzymes with mutations at Ambler positions Arg-244, Met-69, Ser130, Asn-276 and Arg- 275 (2.Bush, K., and Jacoby, G.

In general, these residues are not directly involved in catalysis, although in the case of the Ser-130 the hydroxyl group is postulated to participate in cross-linking the mechanism based inhibitors to lead to irreversible inhibition (4Brown R.P.A. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12421-12432Google Scholar, 5Yang Y. Janota K. Tabei K. Huang N. Siegel M.M. Lin Y.-I. Rasmussen B.A. Shlaes D.M. J. Biol.

Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1980; 289: 321-331Google Scholar), including TEM-1 and SHV-1, contain this amino acid (7Page M.G.P. Drug Resist. Updates. 2000; 3: 109-125Google Scholar). Much is known about the Met-69 mutants of TEM β-lactamase (8Blazquez J. Baquero M.R. Canton R. Alos I. Baquero F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2059-2063Google Scholar, 9Chaibi E.B. Peduzzi J. Farzaneh S. Barthelemy M. Sirot D. Labia R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 38-46Google Scholar) including recent crystal structures of the M69I/M182T and M69V mutants (10Wang X. Minasov G. Shoichet B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32149-32156Google Scholar), but less is known about such variants in SHV (11Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Bonomo R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 37-50Google Scholar). From a crystal structure of wild type SHV-1 (12Kuzin A.P. Michiyoshi N. Michiyoshi Y. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5720-5727Google Scholar), it is known that the width of the substrate binding cavity is 0.7–1.2 Å larger than in TEM-1. The H10 helix residues (218–224) and the residues between the strands of β-pleated sheet such as Glu-240 have the largest deviations from the TEM structure. Also, SHV-1 naturally contains a Thr residue at position 182, which may act to stabilize the overall structure of the wild type and mutant proteins (10Wang X. Minasov G. Shoichet B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32149-32156Google Scholar, 13Huang W. Palzkill T. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8801-8806Google Scholar). An additional E240K mutation in SHV may also act to stabilize the G238S cephalosporinase mutant, SHV-2. In the case of TEM, several explanations for the observed inhibitor resistance have been put forth based on mutagenesis, kinetic, and molecular modeling experiments (9Chaibi E.B. Peduzzi J. Farzaneh S. Barthelemy M. Sirot D. Labia R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 38-46Google Scholar, 14Delaire M. Labia R. Samama J.-P. Masson J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20600-20606Google Scholar, 15Farzaneh S. Chaibi E.B. Peduzzi J. Barthelemy M. Labia R. Blazquez J. Baquero F. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Google Scholar). The two leading hypotheses are 1) that hydrolysis of the inhibitor is favored over irreversible inactivation (14Delaire M. Labia R. Samama J.-P. Masson J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20600-20606Google Scholar) or 2) that decreased affinity for the inhibitor occurs as a result of displacement of a key region of the protein that borders the active site, the B3 strand of the β-pleated sheet (16Bonomo R.A. Dawes C.G. Knox J.R. Shlaes D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 121-125Google Scholar,17Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Google Scholar). Recently, new observations regarding indirect changes focused on Ser-130 have emerged as a possible explanation for the observed inhibitor resistance in the M69I and M69V mutants of TEM (10Wang X. Minasov G. Shoichet B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32149-32156Google Scholar). Also, changes in the molecular dynamics of the M69L mutant of TEM have been modeled based on the recent crystal structure of this enzyme and may be at the heart of inhibitor resistance due to this substitution (18Meroueh S.O. Roblin P. Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S.B. Zhang Y. Samama J.-P. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 9422-9430Google Scholar). With the hypothesis that substitution with smaller, or similarly sized and more hydrophobic residues at position 69 might yield additional inhibitor-resistant enzymes for study based on possible movement of the B3 strand or indirect effects on other catalytically important residues, we set out to explore the role of this residue in defining substrate and inhibitor specificity in SHV. We used mutagenesis to create all the possible amino acid substitutions for Met-69 in SHV-1. These substitutions were then characterized in terms of phenotypic expression of antibiotic and inhibitor resistance in bacteria as well as levels of β-lactamase expression of the variant proteins. Selected enzymes were purified based on novel phenotypes and further characterized kinetically. An energy-minimized molecular modeling approach was undertaken to elucidate the structural changes giving rise to the altered phenotypes. The unexpected finding of variants with selective cephalosporinase activity will be described. Bacterial strains and plasmids used have been described previously (11Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Bonomo R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 37-50Google Scholar). Site saturation mutagenesis and DNA sequencing were performed as previously described (11Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Bonomo R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 37-50Google Scholar). A degenerate codon (NNS) at position Met-69 was used in the oligonucleotide primers constructed by Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). The sequences of the primers were as follows: 5′ GATGAACGCTTTCCCATGNNSAGCACGTTTAAAGTAGTG 3′ and 5′ CACTACTTTAAACGTGCTSNNCATGGGAAAGCGTTCATC 3′ where S can only be G or C. Antibiotics were obtained from the following companies: ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin (Sigma); nitrocefin (Becton-Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD); ceftazidime (Glaxo-Wellcome); sodium tazobactam (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Pearl River, NY); lithium clavulanate (SmithKline Beecham, King of Prussia, PA); sulbactam (Pfizer, New York); ceftriaxone (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); and aztreonam (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for each of the Met-69 variant SHVs expressed in E. coli DH10B cells were determined using an LB agar dilution method as detailed previously (11Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Bonomo R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 37-50Google Scholar). Reported MICs 1The abbreviations used are: MICs, minimum inhibitory concentrations; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CVFF, constant valence force field; r.m.s.d, root mean square deviations represent the median of three to five determinations and did not vary by more than a single dilution between determinations. Steady state expression levels for each of the mutants were obtained using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed in our laboratory and recently reported (19Hujer A.M. Page M.G.P. Helfand M.S. Yeiser B. Bonomo R.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 1947-1957Google Scholar). Each measurement represented the median of four determinations. β-Lactamases were liberated by stringent periplasmic fractionation (20Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Helfand M.S. Anderson V.E. Bonomo R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46 (in press)Google Scholar). The crude lysate was purified in a two-step fashion as follows. First, preparative isoelectric focusing was done in Ultrodex granulated gel (AmershamBiosciences) using ampholines in the pH range of 3.5–10. Nitrocefin was used to locate the β-lactamase band in the gel. The protein was eluted with either 20 mm diethanolamine buffer, pH 8.3, or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The eluted protein solution was concentrated and further purified using a phenylboronate affinity column (MoBiTec, Marco Island, FL) as described previously (20Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Helfand M.S. Anderson V.E. Bonomo R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46 (in press)Google Scholar). The β-lactamase was eluted with 10–40 ml of the 0.5 m borate (boric acid and NaOH), 0.5 m NaCl buffer, pH 7.0 (wild type, M69I, M69L); pH 8.3 (M69G, M69V); pH 10.0 (M69F). Protein concentrations were determined using BioRad Protein Assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA), and purity was determined using an SDS-PAGE gel and was greater than 95%. Kinetic constants K m andk cat were determined by direct measurement of hydrolysis of substrates at room temperature in PBS, pH 7.4, using an AgilentTM 8452 diode array spectrophotometer. Measurements were made using wavelengths and extinction coefficients for nitrocefin, ceftazidime, cephalothin, and ampicillin as previously described (11Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Bonomo R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 37-50Google Scholar). Plots of velocity versus substrate concentration were fitted using Enzfitter software (Biosoft) assuming simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The mean and standard deviation of three experimental determinations are reported. k cat values were calculated from the fitted V max. Catalytic efficiencies were calculated ask cat/K m and ΔΔG‡T was determined from the following equation (21Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1984: 274-278Google Scholar).ΔΔGT‡=ΔGT‡(SHV­1)−ΔGT‡(mutant)Equation 1 =RTln(kcat/Km­mutant)/(kcat/Km­SHV­1))(21)Fifty-percent inhibitory concentrations (IC50concentrations) were obtained using reaction mixtures of PBS buffer, pH 7.4, 100 μm nitrocefin, and varying concentrations of inhibitor (clavulanic acid). Reactions were initiated by addition of a known amount of pure enzyme (50 ng) and measuring reaction velocities at 482 nm. Plots of reaction velocity versus inhibitor concentration were fitted with a decaying exponential curve, and IC50 concentrations are reported as ln (1/2)/exponent. The mean and standard deviation of three determinations were reported. Errors in calculated quantities such as catalytic efficiency and ΔΔG‡T were estimated by calculating the variance (22Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1969: 56-64Google Scholar). Energy-minimized structures of the M69F variant were created with Insight II software (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the Biopolymer and Discover 3 modules. The crystal structure of the SHV-1 β-lactamase (1SHV, Protein Data Bank, Rutgers, NJ) (12Kuzin A.P. Michiyoshi N. Michiyoshi Y. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5720-5727Google Scholar) was used to generate the M69F variant. The two lowest energy conformers of the variant as well as the original wild type structure were subjected to energy minimization to examine the effect of the minimization process. Structures were minimized including hydrogens and crystallographic waters using a pH of 7.4. The catalytically important Lys-73 was protonated, and the residue significant in the deacylation and possibly acylation of the enzyme (23Minasov G. Wang X. Shoichet B.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5333-5340Google Scholar), Glu-166, was deprotonated in the model structure. An active site zone was defined encompassing a radius of 15 Å, centered on the catalytic serine at position 70. Both the constant valence force field (CVFF) and AMBER force field were utilized. Van der Waals interactions were calculated using the cell-multipole method in the CVFF potential. In the AMBER potential, an atom-based method was used with a large 15-Å interaction radius. Coulomb interactions were calculated assuming a distance-dependent dielectric constant multiplied by a factor of 4 in both potentials. The region of the protein not including the active site was fixed, and the backbone atoms of the active site region were restrained by tethering to their starting coordinates using an anharmonic potential. The tethering force constant was varied to examine the effect of this restraint on the total energy of the system. Minimization was done stepwise, in 100-step increments, first calculating the steepest descents and then by conjugate gradient method (Polak-Ribiere) to find the final minimum given the large size of the system. The coordinates determined at convergence were used in the final energy-minimized structures. The structures of the wild type enzyme and the two lowest energy rotameric structures of the Phe variant were compared on the basis of their overall energies and the root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of the active site backbone and side chain positions and evaluated using PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. App. Crystallog. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). To compare the structures of the wild type and M69F enzymes with respect to ceftazidime binding, models were created using the ceftazidime structure from the Amp C enzyme (1IEL, Protein Data Bank) (25Powers R.A. Caselli E. Focia P.J. Prati F. Shoichet B.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9207Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of SHV-1 inhibited with tazobactam (1G56, Protein Data Bank) (26Kuzin A.P. Michiyoshi N. Michiyoshi Y. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1861-1866Google Scholar). Four atoms of the opened β-lactam ring from the ceftazidime structure (C-7, C-8, N-5, and O-9) were initially superimposed with the corresponding atoms of the opened β-lactam ring of tazobactam (C-6, C-7, N-4, and O-8) to facilitate positioning of the molecule into the active site. Biopolymer was again used to generate the two lowest energy rotamers of the M69F substitution and to set the pH at 7.4. Crystallographic waters were used in the energy minimization that was undertaken as described above except that only the CVFF force field was utilized. This was necessary because several atom types found in the ceftazidime molecule could not be defined in the AMBER potential. Minimized structures of the wild type and Phe variant, with and without ceftazidime present, were compared. Site-saturation mutagenesis yielded 18 of 19 substitutions at Ambler position 69. Site-directed mutagenesis was then used to successfully create the M69Q variant that was not found during screening. Two distinct β-lactamase phenotypes (inhibitor-resistant and cephaolsporinase enzymes) were found during the MIC testing. MICs for specific antibiotics are shown in Table I for the inhibitor-resistant variants (M69I,-L,-V), and in Table III for the cephalosporinase variants (M69F,-K,-Y). Overall, of the nineteen variants tested, twelve retained ampicillinase activity (MIC > 2000 μg/ml) (see Supplementary Data, Table I athttp://www.jbc.org). Three variants (M69S, -T and -N) achieved MICs as high as the wild type enzyme (16,000 μg/ml). Strains containing β-lactamases with residues larger than Met demonstrate dramatically increased susceptibility to penicillins. With the addition of the inhibitors clavulanic acid, sulbactam, or tazobactam to a fixed concentration of ampicillin (50 μg/ml) all of the variant strains are more susceptible than wild type, except for the Ile, Leu, and Val variants. Substitution by cysteine leads to selective resistance to inhibition by sulbactam; the tazobactam MIC is equivalent to that of the Leu and wild type enzymes with this inhibitor. In general, the sulfone inhibitors appear to be less potent, requiring higher concentrations than clavulanic acid. However, when piperacillin and tazobactam are used in a fixed ratio of 8:1 as in the commercially available preparation, all the isolates are susceptible. All isolates, including wild type, are susceptible to aztreonam and cefotaxime with MICs < 1.0 μg/ml (data not shown). The bacteria containing the Pro substituted enzyme are highly susceptible to all antibiotics studied.Table IInhibitor-resistant SHV β-lactamase Met-69 mutant MICs (μg/ml) for select antibioticsMet-69 substitutionAmpicillinAmpicillin/clavulanateAmpicillin/sulbactamAmpicillin/tazobactamCeftazidimeμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlWild type, Met1600050/2.050/6450/322.0Val820050/8.050/13050/640.50Leu820050/4.050/13050/320.50Ile820050/8.050/13050/640.50 Open table in a new tab Table IIICephalosporinase SHV β-lactamase Met-69 Mutant MICs (μg/ml) for select antibioticsMet-69 substitutionAmpicillinAmpicillin/clavulanateCeftazidimeWild type, Met16,00050/2.02.0Lys51050/0.034.0Phe51050/0.068.0Tyr6450/04.0 Open table in a new tab Table IIKinetic Constants for Wild Type, M69I, -L and -VSubstrateProteinK mk catk cat/K mRelativek cat/K mΔΔG‡TμMs −1X106m−1s−1kJ m−1AmpicillinSHV-1150 ± 302300 ± 30015 ± 11M69I39 ± 4500 ± 10010 ± 20.95− 0.1 ± 0.4M69L110 ± 201050 ± 4010 ± 10.7− 1 ± 0.3M69V80 ± 20800 ± 10010 ± 10.7− 1 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab The level of expression was quite variable for each of the substituted enzymes, both in terms of the individual variation from experiment to experiment, and when comparing the relative amounts produced by each variant-containing strain (see Supplementary Data Table II at http://www.jbc.org). It is most important to note however that none of the resistant variants (M69I, -L, -V, -F, -K, -Y) was produced in excess of the wild type β-lactamase. The M69P enzyme was not produced in any measurable quantity. The K m andk cat values for the purified variant enzymes and wild type enzymes with their substrates are summarized in Tables II andIV, together with the calculated catalytic efficiencies and ΔΔG‡T values relative to wild type enzyme. With ampicillin, the majority of the variant enzymes studied retain their catalytic efficiency with the notable exception of the M69F protein. The M69I variant has a lower k catthan the wild type enzyme, but the catalytic efficiency is compensated by the reduction in K m. For ceftazidime, only the wild type and M69F enzymes have measurable rates of hydrolysis. For this substrate, the Phe variant demonstrates greater than 10-fold increased efficiency (relativek cat/K m = 10.4), driven by both increases in k cat and decreasedK m.Table IVKinetic constants for wild type and M69FSubstrateProteinK mk catk cat/K mRelativek cat/K mΔΔG‡TμMs−1X106,m−1s−1kJM−1CeftazidimeSHV-115 ± 40.21 ± 0.020.014 ± .0021M69F4.8 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.10.15 ± 0.0210+ 6 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab The IC50 concentrations (data not shown) for the inhibitor-resistant enzymes are higher for clavulanic acid than in the wild type enzyme, consistent with the MIC data. The M69F enzyme has an IC50 comparable to that of SHV-1. Fig. 3depicts the overlay of the wild type and M69F variant and was generated by superimposing the backbone atoms of the original wild type crystal structure and the energy-minimized M69F structure. There is significantly less than 0.5 Å r.m.s.d. in their respective coordinates overall. On a per residue basis, no significant (>0.5 Å) deviations were noted for the side chain or backbone atoms when the minimized structures were compared. Despite the small structural changes (especially when compared with the overall resolution of the crystal structures on which the models are based), final energies of the wild type and M69F variant were not equivalent. The M69F enzyme was ∼60 kcal/mol higher in energy using a CVFF potential. The AMBER minimizations gave a qualitatively similar result. Reduction in the tethering force constant used to restrain only the active site backbone atoms did not result in significant changes in the overall energy (<2 kcal/mol). The most significant differences, accounting for ∼70% of the total energy difference, occurred in the non-bonded (repulsive and dispersive van der Waals) interactions, without any specific residues implicated. PROCHECK analyses of these structures showed that the stereochemistry of the wild type and Phe models was the same, with good quality Ramachandran plot statistics (93.5% of residues in most favored regions). Only two residues were in generously allowed regions: Tyr-105 and Met- (Phe) 69, irrespective of the model or the minimization procedure. No distorted geometries were noted for residues critical to catalytic activity, prior to or after the minimization procedures. The model depicting ceftazidime bound in the active site of the Phe variant is shown in Fig. 4 and shows the carboxylate group on the oxyimino side chain pointing away from the negatively charged Asp-104 and Glu-240 side chains at the opening of the active site cleft.Figure 4Stereo view of ceftazidime in the active site of M69F.

Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Google Scholar). Its side chain is buried in the hydrophobic core of the enzyme, and its dihedral angles are outside of energetically favorable conformations by Ramachandran plots (14Delaire M. Labia R. Samama J.-P. Masson J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20600-20606Google Scholar). Many hypotheses (10Wang X. Minasov G. Shoichet B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32149-32156Google Scholar, 14Delaire M. Labia R.

Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Google Scholar) exist regarding the exact role this residue plays in defining bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in strains containing these altered enzymes. Our study of SHV variants shows that two distinct enzyme phenotypes can result from amino acid substitutions at this position. The size of the residue at position 69 dramatically impacts on this substrate specificity. This is borne out in the kinetic analyses that show both increased affinity and catalytic rates for ceftazidime in the M69F variant and in reduced inhibitor affinity but preserved ampicillinase activity in the inhibitor-resistant variants. This comes at a high energetic cost to the Phe variant as demonstrated by our modeling studies. Similar to TEM β-lactamase in SHV, only the Ile, Leu, and Val substitutions lead to inhibitor resistance, this despite the differences that are already present in the active site cavity size of SHV compared with TEM (12Kuzin A.P. Michiyoshi N. Michiyoshi Y. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5720-5727Google Scholar). Recent crystal structures of the TEM-32(M69I/M182T) and TEM-34(M69V) mutants at 1.61 and 1.52 Å resolution, respectively, show that the Ser-130 residue adopts a conformation in which it does not hydrogen bond as well with the Ser-70 in the apoenzyme (10Wang X.

Whether a direct effect on the position of the Ser-70 may also occur, resulting in disruption of the positioning of an inhibitor intermediate with respect to Ser-130, is not clear. The structural data reported shows differences on the order of 0.1–2.4 Å (greatest for the Ser-70Oγ-Ser-130Oγ distance in the TEM-32 mutant compared with the M182T “wild type” mutant). Previous modeling studies of TEM have been unable to demonstrate these structural changes (9Chaibi E.B. Peduzzi J. Farzaneh S. Barthelemy M. Sirot D. Labia R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 38-46Google Scholar, 14Delaire M. Labia R. Samama J.-P. Masson J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20600-20606Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent crystal structure of TEM M69L shows an overall r.m.s.d. of only 0.57 Å for the main chain atoms, and kinetic constants reveal the same preservation of function for this enzyme that we have observed for SHV (18Meroueh S.O. Roblin P. Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S.B. Zhang Y. Samama J.-P. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 9422-9430Google Scholar). The explanation given for inhibitor resistance behavior in TEM M69L is that relative dynamic motion of Leu-69 and other active site residues is better correlated with movement of the Ω loop (Glu-166, Asn-170) than in the wild type structure. Unfavorable electrostatic interactions also exist that may prevent the usual positioning of the inhibitor C3 carboxylate with the Arg-244. Such indirect effects of Met-69 mutations on the Ser-130 do not speak to affinity differences that might occur when β-lactams initially bind in the active site since Ser-130 is thought to interact mainly with the acyl enzyme intermediates (the Schiff base imine) (4Brown R.P.A. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12421-12432Google Scholar, 5Yang Y. Janota K. Tabei K. Huang N. Siegel M.M. Lin Y.-I. Rasmussen B.A. Shlaes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26674-26682Google Scholar, 6Imtiaz U. Billings E.M. Knox J.R. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4435-4442Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the affinity of the variant SHV enzymes (both the inhibitor-resistant and cephalosporinase proteins) improves for a variety of β-lactam compounds, but affinity for clavulanic acid decreases for the inhibitor-resistant group. Ser-130 is also known to be involved in the slow, irreversible inhibition of the enzyme presumably by forming a cross-linked structure with a fragment of the inhibitor and the Ser-70 (4Brown R.P.A. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12421-12432Google Scholar, 5Yang Y. Janota K. Tabei K. Huang N. Siegel M.M. Lin Y.-I. Rasmussen B.A. Shlaes D.M. J. Biol.

However, given the small partition coefficient along this pathway (1Charnas R.L. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3214-3219Google Scholar, 27Brenner D.G. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5833-5839Google Scholar) and the timeframe of the bacterial lifespan, i.e. 20 min, it is unlikely that β-lactamase inhibitors have their clinical efficacy primarily via this irreversible pathway; rather, the transiently inhibited species may play a more significant role. Since hydrogen bonding by Ser-130 is felt to stabilize the acylation transition state structure rather than the initial Michaelis complex, this is where conformational changes in Ser-130, indirectly mediated by particular Met-69 substitutions, might play a role in resistance to inhibition. Whether this could also affect substrate specificity is less clear. The presence of two conformations of Ser-70 in the TEM crystal structures is also intriguing given that the backbone amide of Ser-70 forms part of the oxyanion hole. That would influence both initial β-lactam binding as well as the rates of acylation and potentially deacylation if positioning with respect to the catalytic water and Glu-166 are also affected. This would explain the altered kinetic constants that we observed both in the inhibitor-resistant variants and the cephalosporinase variants. Similarly, more coordinated motion of the active site residues with the critical residues of the Ω loop in these variants could explain improved cephalosporinase activity as well as inhibitor resistance behavior. Our modeling studies of M69F have again demonstrated the limitations of this methodology when based on crystal structures of finite resolution. We did not find evidence in our models for movement of Asp-104, the critical Gly-238 and Glu-240 residues, or the residues that make up part of the omega loop, including Glu-166, and Asn-170, to explain the increased cephalosporinase activity of the enzyme. This occurred despite considerable efforts to allow free active site motion during minimization. However, despite only small structural changes, the overall energy of the M69F variant is considerably increased. This increase is somewhat startling in its magnitude given that the protein was extremely stable. The energetic “cost” of the mutation is not ameliorated by binding of the substrate; that is, the increase in the energy of the system on binding substrate is not less for the Phe variant than for the wild type enzyme. ΔG‡T may be lower in the Phe variant than in the wild type because of its relatively less stable, higher energy ground state apoenzyme structure, assuming the same transition state structure for both. In conclusion, these observations provide evidence of a unifying explanation regarding the role of the residue at position 69: its greatest effect is in determining substrate specificity. This is likely because of its uniquely constrained, high energy position proximal to the critical catalytic serine 70 and because of indirect effects on both the Ser-70 and Ser-130. Recent crystal structures of Met-69 mutants of TEM bear out the indirect effects of this residue on both catalytically important Ser residues. We have shown that the entire range of resistance phenotypes is possible by merely varying one residue within the β-lactamase enzyme. However, resistance comes at a cost of altered enzyme specificity and increased overall energy, particularly in the case of cephalosporinase phenotypes that lose most of their ampicillinase function and are ready targets for inhibitors of these enzymes. Crystal structures of these mutants with inhibitors in their active sites and of the M69F variant would be extremely valuable in further elucidating the impact of the Met-69 residue on protein structure and function.

They are composed of tubulin, a heterodimeric protein, consisting of two similar polypeptides α and β. In mammalian cells, both α- and β-tubulin occur as seven to eight different genetic variants, which also undergo numerous posttranslational modifications that include tyrosination-detyrosination and deglutamylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, polyglutamylation, and polyglycylation. Tyrosination-detyrosination is one of the major posttranslational modifications in which the C-terminal tyrosine residue in α-tubulin is added or removed reversibly. Although this modification does not alter the assembly activity of tubulin in vitro, these two forms of tubulin have been found to be distributed differently in vivo and are also correlated with microtubule stability (Gunderson, G. G., Kalnoski, M. H., and Bulinski, J. C. (1984) Cell 38, 779–789). Thus, the question arises as to whether these two forms of tubulin differ in any other modifications. In an effort to answer this question, the tyrosinated and the nontyrosinated forms of the α1/2 isoform have been purified from brain tubulin by immunoaffinity chromatography. matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometric analysis of the C-terminal peptide revealed that the tyrosinated form is polyglutamylated with one to four Glu residues, while the Δ2 tubulin is polyglycylated with one to three Gly residues. These results indicate that posttranslational modifications of tubulin are correlated with each other and that polyglutamylation and polyglycylation of tubulin may have important roles in regulating microtubule assembly, stability, and function in vivo.

Microtubules are eukaryotic structures that maintain cell morphology and mediate diverse and vital cellular functions including mitosis, intracellular transport, and secretion (1Olmsted J.B.

Microtubule Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990Google Scholar). Tubulin, the heterodimeric αβ subunit of microtubules, exists as multiple isoforms whose expression patterns differ among tissues (5–23). In mammalian system, there are at least seven different isoforms of α-tubulin designated as α1, α2, α3/7, α4, α6, α8, and αTT1 (18-23). On the other hand, eight β-tubulins are designated as βI, βII, βIII,βIVa, βIVb, βV,βVI, and βVII. Whether the functional diversity of microtubules arises from the existence of different tubulin isoforms is not very clear. However, in vitrostudies have demonstrated that tubulin heterodimers containing different β-tubulins have significant differences in their assembly (23Banerjee A. Roach M.C. Trcka P.P. Luduena R.F.

In addition to the existence of different genetic variations, α- and β-tubulin also undergo a number of covalent modifications that include tyrosination-detyrosination (34Barra H.S. Arce C.A.

Polyglycylation of tubulin has hitherto been observed in flagellar and ciliary microtubules (48Redeker V. Levilliers N. Schmitter J.-M. Le Caer J.-P. Rossier J. Adoutte A. Bré M.-H. Science. 1994; 266: 1688-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and could conceivably play a role in the unusual stability and morphology of these microtubules. Except for acetylation and phosphorylation, most of these covalent modifications occur near the C termini of α- and β-tubulin. It is not known exactly how different posttranslational modifications affect the function of tubulin and microtubules in vivo. Although tyrosinated and nontyrosinated tubulin do not appear to differ in the assembly (36Raybin D. Flavin M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 40Barra H.S. Arce C.A. Rodriguez J.A. Caputto R. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), these two forms of tubulin are known to be distributed differently in the interphase microtubules and are believed to form separate populations of microtubules. Microtubules enriched in detyrosinated tubulin appear to be much more stable than those enriched in tyrosinated tubulin (42Gunderson G.G. Kalnoski M.H. Bulinski J.C. Cell. 1984; 38: 779-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems possible, that the tyrosinated and the nontyrosinated forms of tubulin may differ in other covalent modifications that may give rise to different subsets of microtubules in vivo. In an effort to study how different covalent modifications may contribute to the structure and function of a tubulin isoform, tubulin dimers were separated on an immunoaffinity column that contained a monoclonal antibody to tyrosinated α1/2 tubulin (56Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). My previous results demonstrated that the tubulin dimers containing tyrosinated form of α1/2 assemble poorly in the presence of glycerol and Mg2+. In this manuscript, I have analyzed the covalent modifications of tyrosinated and nontyrosinated α1/2 by MALDI-TOF 1The abbreviations used for: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MAP, microtubule-associated protein. mass spectrometry. The results show that tyrosinated α1/2 is polyglutamylated with one to four Glu residues, the tetraglutamylated form being the predominant one. On the other hand, the Δ2 form of α1/2 that assembles normally is polyglycylated with one to three glycyl units, the biglycylated form being the major one. These results indicate that there is a correlation between tyrosination/detyrosination and deglutamylation of tubulin on one hand and polyglutamylation/polyglycylation on the other hand. This correlation among posttranslational modifications of tubulin is a novel finding. Since tyrosination/detyrosination appears to play a role in microtubule stability, these results raise the possibility that polyglycylation and polyglutamylation may also be involved in microtubule stability and function. These results also indicate that polyglycylation is not restricted to tubulin destined to form axonemal microtubules. Mes, CNBr-activated Sepharose, trifluoroacetic acid, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid were obtained from Sigma. Bovine brain cortex was obtained from Kiolbassa Meat Company, San Antonio, TX. Microtubules were isolated from bovine brain cortex by one cycle of assembly and disassembly as described before (17Banerjee A. Roach M.C. Wall K. Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Ludueña R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3029-3034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tubulin was purified from microtubules by phosphocellulose chromatography. MAP2 and tau were purified from microtubule proteins by ultrogel chromatography. All purifications were carried out in Mes-Na (pH 6.4), 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 1.0 mm GTP. Different α-tubulin isoforms were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using an anti-α column as previously described (56Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, tubulin was first passed through the immunoaffinity column containing the monoclonal antibody AYN.6D10. The unbound fraction (Fraction A) was pooled and concentrated in 8 m glycerol and was frozen. After elution of the unbound fraction, the column was washed, and the bound fraction was eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. Of the two peaks, the first is designated as Fraction B, while the second peak is Fraction C. All these fractions were desalted immediately after the elution, dialyzed against 8 mglycerol in assembly buffer and were stored frozen at –80 °C. Prior to an experiment, glycerol was removed from the protein samples by repeated desalting in Centricon spin columns. Separation of α-tubulin was performed as described previously (56Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, tubulin subunits were first separated on preparative SDS-PAGE, and the bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the α-tubulin band was excised, and tubulin was electroeluted. Contaminating SDS was removed from the eluted protein by acetone precipitation. Purified α-tubulin in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.2) was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (17 μg/ml) at 30 °C for 12–16 h. The digested protein was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using a Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) as described previously (56Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and Solvent B was 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile. Chromatography was performed using a gradient of 0–60% solvent B in 60 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The C-terminal peptide was identified by sequencing the first five amino acid residues. Sequence analysis was performed as described previously (56Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF analysis was performed at the Protein Core Facility, Department of Biochemistry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York. HPLC-purified C-terminal peptides were diluted in a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile/water and were spotted directly. The samples were examined by MALDI-TOF in a positive and linear mode. Spectra were obtained using a Voyager RP Biospectrometry Work Station (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), using a 300-nm laser at an accelerating voltage of 28 kV. Internal calibration was performed using an ACTH fragment obtained from Sigma. About 50–120 laser scans were performed for each spectrum. Amino acid analysis and protein sequencing were performed at the Protein Core Facility of the Department of Biochemistry as described before (56Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein measurements, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were performed as described before (56Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Bovine brain tubulin contains two α-tubulin isoforms, α1/2 and α4. Using an anti-α-tubulin immunoaffinity column I have previously fractionated bovine brain tubulin into three functionally active forms, fractions A, B, and C (56Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis showed that this fraction is not recognized by the monoclonal antibodies to tyrosinated tubulin. Sequence analyses have shown that Fraction A contains nontyrosinated forms of α1/2 that may include Δ2 tubulin. Fraction B is a mixture of the nontyrosinated forms of α1/2 and α4. Fraction C is essentially the tyrosinated form of α1/2. Since fractions A and C are primarily the nontyrosinated and the tyrosinated forms of α1/2, these constituted an appropriate system for structural comparisons. Thus, it was interesting to study the posttranslational modifications on these two fractions by MALDI-TOF analyses. Bovine brain tubulin contains two α-tubulin isoforms, α1/2 and α4, and each of the isoforms have three posttranslational variations, namely the tyrosinated (Tyr form), the detyrosinated (Glu form), and the Δ2 form (lacking both the Tyr and Glu residues from the C terminus). The expectedm/z values for the protonated forms (MH+) are given in TableI.Table IExpected mass values for the C-terminal peptides of different α-tubulin isoformsTubulin isoformSequenceExpected mass values for the MH+ in MALDI-TOFΔ2-α4DYEEVGIDSYEDEDEGE1992.73Glu-α4DYEEVGIDSYEDEDEGEE2121.78Tyr-α4DYEEVGIDSYEDEDEGEEY2285.84Δ2-α1/2DYEEVGVDSVEGEGEEEGE2056.81Glu-α1/2DYEEVGVDSVEGEGEEEGEE2185.84Tyr-α1/2DYEEVGVDSVEGEGEEEGEEY2348.89 Open table in a new tab To study the posttranslational status of the purified tubulin fractions, the C-terminal peptide was isolated by preparative SDS-PAGE, followed by digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C as previously described (56Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The C-terminal peptide was separated by reversed phase HPLC on a C18 column and was identified by sequencing the N-terminal five residues (DYEEV) since this sequence does not exist anywhere other than the C-terminal. The fractions that were confirmed to have the C-terminal sequence were examined by MALDI-TOF. Fig. 1 A shows the HPLC profile of the endoprotease Lys-C-digested Fraction A. Sequence analysis shows that the C-terminal peptide is present in two peaks: a major peaka followed by a minor peak b (A). The peaks a and b were both found to contain the sequence DYEEVGVDSVEGEGEEEGE, which corresponds to the Δ2 form of α1/2. The underlining of the Glu residues (Glu445, Glu447, and Glu449) signifies that signals for those residues in the sequencing chromatogram were poor, indicating that the residues might be modified by posttranslational modification. MALDI-TOF analysis revealed that peak a exhibits a single major peak atm/z value of 2170 and several minor peaks at 2227.8, 2322.66, 2387.29, 2451.7, and 2516.22 (Fig. 1 C). Peak b exhibits peaks at 2113.82, 2149, 2170, and 2227.8. The peaks at 2113 and 2170 differ by 57, which is the mass value of a glycyl unit (2170−2113 = 57), and the peaks at 2170 and 2227 also differ by 57 (2227−2170 = 57). Since the mass values for the unmodified Δ2 forms for α1/2 and α4 are 2057 and 1993, respectively, the peaks at 2113, 2170, and 2227 originate by the addition of 1, 2, and 3 glycyl units to the Δ2 form of α1/2. Thus Fraction A is modified with one to three posttranslationally added glycyl residues, the biglycylated form being the major species. At this point, it is not possible to identify the three minor peaks at 2149, 2323, and 2387. The peak at 2149 may have originated from the Δ2 form of α1/2 or α4. If it originates from α1/2, the mass of the modification would be 92 (2149−2057 = 92). No known modification to this date exists with this mass value. On the other hand, if it originates from α4, the mass of the modification would be 156 (2149−1993 = 156), which is the mass of an arginine residue. At this point it is difficult to conclude about this modification. The mass peaks at 2323 and 2387 are 200 mass units higher than the expected mass values for the Glu forms for α4 and α1/2, respectively, (2123 + 200 = 2323, 2187 + 200 = 2387). The other minor peaks at 2451 and 2516 seems to be derived from 2323 and 2387 by the addition of a mass unit of 129, which is a Glu residue (2452 = 2323 + 129, 2516 = 2387 + 129). The analysis for tyrosinated α1/2 is summarized in Fig.2. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the C-terminal peptide eluted as a single peak. Sequence analysis showed that this peptide contains the sequence DYEEVGVDSVEGEGEEEGEEY, which is the sequence of the tyrosinated form of α1/2. Here also the signals for the underlined Glu residues (Glu445, Glu447, Glu449, and Glu450) were poor, indicating that the residues may be modified by posttranslational modification. MALDI-TOF analysis of this tubulin isoform as shown in Fig.2 B, revealed a major peak at 2866.57 and several minor peaks at 2057, 2350, 2479, 2608.5, and 2737.54. The peak at 2350 corresponds to tyrosinated α1/2, and the peaks at 2479, 2609, 2737, and 2866 appear to be derived from the addition of one, two, three, and four Glu units (m/z 129) to 2350 (2479 = 2350 + 129; 2608 = 2350 + 2 × 129; 2737 = 2350 + 3 × 129; 2866 = 2350 + 4 × 129). Thus this fraction seems to be polyglutamylated with one to four Glu residues, and the tetraglutamylated is the major one. In an effort to confirm the presence of posttranslationally added Gly residues, amino acid analyses were performed on the C-terminal peptides. Since the peptide contains one Ser residue, the amount of Gly residues were calculated per mole of Ser present in the peptide. Analysis of Δ2 tubulin revealed that this fraction (Fraction A) contains 6.2 moles of Gly per mole of Ser. Similar analysis for the tyrosinated tubulin showed that it contained 4 moles of Gly per mole of Ser. These results clearly demonstrate that the Δ2 tubulin is modified with more than two posttranslationally added Gly residues, while the tyrosinated tubulin does not contain any posttranslationally added Gly residue. In my previous study, different α-tubulin isoforms were separated in functionally active forms. The fraction that did not bind the affinity column was found to be the nontyrosinated form of α1/2, while the tyrosinated α1/2 was eluted from the column using a salt gradient. These two fractions exhibited remarkable differences in their assembly properties. The nontyrosinated fraction assembled fairly well, while the tyrosinated fraction did it poorly. Thus, it was tempting to study whether these two fractions differ in their posttranslational modifications. In this study, I have studied the posttranslational status of affinity-purified α-tubulin isoforms by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometric data for the nontyrosinated α1/2 exhibited the major peak at 2170 with some minor peaks at 2113 and 2227. The peaks at 2170 clearly indicate that this must be smaller than the Glu form of α1/2. This fraction must therefore be the Δ2 form of α1/2. The minor peak at 2113 differs from the mass of the Δ2 form by 57. The peaks at 2113, 2170, and 2227 are formed by the addition of one, two, and three glycyl units (57 mass units) to the Δ2 form of α1/2. Amino acid analyses of the C-terminal peptide also confirmed the presence of more than two Gly residues per mole of the peptide. The analysis of Tyr-α1/2 revealed that this fraction exhibited a major peak at 2867 and several minor peaks at 2057, 2350, 2479, 2608, and 2737. All these peaks except at 2057 clearly originate from tyrosinated α1/2 and correspond to the modifications with one, two, three, and four glutamate units. The peak at 2057 corresponds to the Δ2 form of α1/2. The MALDI-TOF signals clearly indicate that the tetra-glutamylated form is the major species. It should be mentioned that both isoforms of α1/2 exhibited several unidentified minor species in the mass spectrograph. The peak at 2149 seems to be derived from the Δ2 form of α4 by the addition of a mass unit of 156, which is the mass of an arginine residue. On the other hand, the peaks at 2323 and 2387 seem to be derived from the Δ2 forms of α4 and α1/2 by the addition of a mass unit of 200. Though it may be tempting to conclude that these modifications might be due to the addition of a glutamate (129 mass unit) and an alanine residue (71 mass unit), extensive mass spectrometric analyses are required to confirm this. It is not known whether the glycylating enzyme can use any other amino acid (such as alanine, serine, or histidine) as its substrate. Purification of this enzyme will be essential to shed more light on this. It is interesting to note that the two forms of α1/2 differ remarkably in their assembly properties in the presence of Mg2+ (56Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The detyrosinated α1/2 assembled quite normally, while the tyrosinated form did it poorly. Although it was predicted in my earlier work that these two forms might differ in their posttranslational modifications, the present MALDI-TOF studies clearly show that the major difference is in the glycylation/glutamylation status of the isoform. If one compares the major peaks for both the fractions, one can see that the detyrosinated form is mainly the biglycylated Δ2 form of α1/2, while the tyrosinated form is mainly the tetraglutamylated form of tyrosinated α1/2. It is conceivable that these two forms will differ significantly in the charge distribution at the C terminus. Since it is believed that the C termini of α- and β-tubulin is involved in the binding of MAPs to tubulin (59Larcher J.-C. Boucher D. Lazereg S. Gros F. Denoulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22117-22124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 60Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros F. Denoulet P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12839-12848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), polyglycylation and polyglutamylation may represent modifications by which the assembly and disassembly of microtubules may be regulated in vivo. These results are fairly consistent with the recent study by Vinh et al. (54Vinh J. Langridge J.I. Bre M.H. Levilliers N. Redeker V. Loyaux D. Rossier J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3133-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which shows that both dynamic cytoplasmic microtubules as well as stable axonemal microtubules, can be glycylated on each of the last four C-terminal glutamate residues of Glu437, Glu438, Glu439, and Glu441 in the β-tubulin sequence427DATAEEEGEFEEEGEQ442. In both dynamic and stable microtubules, the majority of the β-tubulin contains six posttranslationally added glycine residues: two glycine residues on both Glu437 and Glu438 and one glycine residue on both Glu439 and Glu441. In this context it should be mentioned that Redeker et al.(55Redeker V. Rossier J. Frankfurter T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14838-14844Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) did not observe glycylation in brain tubulin. They have studied the posttranslational modifications of α-tubulin from unfractionated PC-tubulin (tubulin purified by phosphocellulose chromatography) by purifying the C-terminal peptide on an arginine-Sepharose column. On the other hand, my affinity column separates the Δ2 form of α1/2 from its tyrosinated form. It is not known whether α4 also is glycylated. Sequencing studies have identified α4 tubulin in a fraction (Fraction B) that contained both α1/2 and α4 as the detyrosinated forms. MALDI-TOF analysis of this fraction yielded many unknown species, which makes me believe that α4 may be subject to posttranslational modifications other than polyglycylation and polyglutamylation. To get a clear picture on the posttranslational modification of α4, it must be separated from α1/2 prior to mass-spectrometric analysis. At this point it is not clear about the number of glutamate residues modified by polyglycylation. I have previously suggested that there might be more than one Glu residue that may be modified (56Banerjee A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The sequencing chromatogram identified residues Glu445, Glu447, and Glu449, which gave poor signals indicating that these residues are probably modified by polyglycylation. Thus it seems likely that the residues Glu445, Glu447, and Glu449 are each modified by the addition of a glycyl unit. The tubulin molecule is subject to a large number of posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, tyrosination/detyrosination, deglutamylation, polyglutamylation and polyglycylation (21Ludueña R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general the functional significance of these modifications is not well understood. Tyrosination and detyrosination are thought to be involved, respectively, in the destabilization and stabilization of microtubules (57Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2597-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and acetylation appears to stabilize microtubules also (58Geyp M. Ireland C.M. Pittman S.M. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1996; 87: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that polyglutamylation of α and phosphorylation of the βIIIisotype of tubulin may regulate the interaction of microtubules with MAPs (59Larcher J.-C. Boucher D. Lazereg S. Gros F. Denoulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22117-22124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 60Boucher D. Larcher J.-C. Gros F. Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that polyglutamylation of tubulin modulated the interaction of tubulin with MAP1A, MAP1B, MAP2, and tau (61Bonet C. Boucher D. Lazereg S. Pedrotti B. Islam K. Denoulet P. Larcher J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12839-12848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Deglutamylation removes α-tubulin from the tyrosination/detyrosination cycle and also leads to increased microtubule stability (43Paturle-Lafanechère L. Eddé B. Denoulet P. Van Dorsselaer A. Mazarguil H. La Caer J.-P. Wehland H. Job D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10523-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), while polyglycylation, hitherto found only in axonemal microtubules, may play a role in the formation and stabilization of those unusual microtubules (62Thazhath R. Liu C. Gaertig J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Since the MAPs-binding domain on tubulin is localized on the region of helices H11 and H12 on the electron crystallographic structure of tubulin (63Nogales E. Wolff S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 198-203Crossref Scopus (1808) Google Scholar), it is possible that polyglutamylation or polyglycylation can modulate the conformation of the binding domain drastically. The results reported here have several implications for these issues. First they indicate that polyglycylation can occur in non-axonemal microtubules, thereby reopening the question of the function of this modification. As far as is known, in mammalian sperm only β-tubulin is polyglycylated (49Rüdiger M. Plessman U. Rüdiger A.-H. Weber K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Studies with Tetrahymena ciliary tubulin suggest that, although both α- and β-tubulin are polyglycylated, only the polyglycylation of β is important in axonemal function (61Bonet C. Boucher D. Lazereg S. Pedrotti B. Islam K. Denoulet P. Larcher J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12839-12848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus the finding reported here that mammalian brain α1/2 is polyglycylated is a novel observation and raises the possibility that polyglycylation of α-tubulin serves a unique function. Second, these results show that tyrosinated and deglutamylated (Δ2) tubulins differ in more than just two residues, and that one form is polyglutamylated and the other is polyglycylated. This is the first time that any posttranslational modifications of tubulin have been found to be correlated with each other. Third, they raise questions regarding the mechanism of the modifications. For example, is tubulin deglutamylated before being polyglycylated orvice versa? In either case the modifying enzymes must be specific for one particular form of tubulin. Does one modification make the other irreversible? The possibility now exists that there is a pathway of sequential modifications of the tubulin molecule. Fourth, these results suggest that some as yet unknown modifications may occur to the α4 isotype. Studies are in progress toward investigating these questions.

https://openalex.org/W2008940576,"RNA polymerase II-associating protein 74 (RAP74) is the large subunit of transcription factor IIF (TFIIF), which is essential for accurate initiation and stimulates elongation by RNA polymerase II. Mutations within or adjacent to the α1 helix of the RAP74 subunit have been shown to decrease both initiation and elongation stimulation activities without strongly affecting the interactions of RAP74 with the RAP30 subunit or the interaction between TFIIF and RNA polymerase II. In this manuscript, mutations within the α1 helix are compared with mutations made throughout the neighboring conserved N-terminal domain of RAP74. Changes within the N-terminal domain include disruptions of specific contacts with the α1 helix, which were revealed in the recently published x-ray crystal structure (Gaiser, F., Tan, S., and Richmond, T. J. (2000) J. Mol. Biol. 302, 1119–1127). Contacts between the β4-β5 loop and the α1 helix are shown to be largely unimportant for α1 helix function. Other mutations throughout the N-terminal domain are consistent with the establishment of the dimer interface with the RAP30 subunit. The RAP74-RAP30 interface is important for TFIIF function, but no particular RAP74 amino acids within this region have been identified that are required for TFIIF activities. The molecular target of the α1 helix remains unknown, but our studies refocus attention on this important functional motif of TFIIF.

TFIIF 1The abbreviations used are: TFIIF, transcription factor IIF; RAP, RNA polymerase II-associating protein; TBP, TATA-binding protein; wt, wild type appears to be an αβ heterodimer of RAP74 and RAP30 subunits, and previous reports that TFIIF may be an α2β2 heterotetramer are not supported by the x-ray crystal structure (1Gaiser F. Tan S. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1119-1127Google Scholar). Although not evident from primary sequence, RAP74 and RAP30 subunits are structurally similar, with an intricate series of N-terminalβ-sheets that form a RAP74-RAP30 dimer interface. RAP74 and RAP30 also have similar C-terminal regions with winged helix-turn-helix structures (2Groft C.M. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Werner M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9117-9122Google Scholar,3Kamada K. De Angelis J. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3115-3120Google Scholar). The larger size of the human RAP74 subunit can be attributed to an extensive loop rich in Gly, Pro, Ser, Thr, and charged residues separating more structured N- and C-terminal domains (4Aso T. Vasavada H.A. Kawaguchi T. Germino F.J. Ganguly S. Kitajima S. Weissman S.M. Yasukochi Y. Nature. 1992; 355: 461-464Google Scholar, 5Finkelstein A. Kostrub C.F. Li J. Chavez D.P. Wang B.Q. Fang S.M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 464-467Google Scholar). TFIIF is an RNA polymerase II-specific transcription factor restricted to the eukaryotic kingdom. Fig. 1, therefore, shows an amino acid sequence alignment of the N-terminal regions of several RAP74 homologues spaced throughout eukaryotic evolution. Beneath the alignment, the primary sequence is correlated with regions of secondary structure. Regions of α-helix and β-sheet are derived from the crystal structure of human TFIIF (1Gaiser F. Tan S. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1119-1127Google Scholar) or else from secondary structure predictions (6Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Google Scholar, 7Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60Google Scholar, 8Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-77Google Scholar, 9Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Google Scholar) in the regions where structural information is not available. The x-ray crystal structure indicates a unique dimer interface made up of RAP74 β-sheets β1, β2, β3, β6, β7, β8, and the corresponding β-sheets in RAP30. The β4 and β5 sheets of RAP74 interact to form the structured base of a loop that diverges from the dimer core. In the crystal structure, the RAP74 α1 helix makes intimate contacts with the β4 and β5 sheets. The α1 helix has been shown previously to be highly sensitive to mutation (10Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Google Scholar, 11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar). Several single amino acid changes, particularly in hydrophobic residues, cause significant defects in both accurate initiation and elongation. Because of symmetrical effects on initiation and elongation, α1 should function by contacting a molecular target common to both processes, which would implicate RNA polymerase II, TFIIF, and DNA as the most likely targets. Mutations in α1 do not appear to affect interaction with the RAP30 subunit, and no RAP30 contacts are identified for α1 in the crystal structure (1Gaiser F. Tan S. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1119-1127Google Scholar). As far as can be discerned, α1 mutations do not have an effect on assembly of gel-shifted preinitiation complexes that include the TATA-binding protein (TBP), TFIIB, RNA polymerase II, and TFIIF (10Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Google Scholar). Therefore, if the molecular target of α1 is RNA polymerase II, the α1 contact is not critical for TFIIF binding, and, from the TFIIF structure, α1 does not appear to contact RAP30. Particularly sensitive residues within or adjacent to α1 include Leu-155, Trp-164, Asn-172, Ile-176, and Met-177. Substituting any of these residues with alanine, which is a change consistent with maintaining the α-helical structure, significantly reduces accurate initiation and elongation stimulation without apparent effects on known protein-protein contacts (10Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Google Scholar,11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar). Before the availability of the x-ray crystal structure, our laboratory began a systematic mutagenic analysis of conserved regions within the N-terminal domain of RAP74. When the structure became available, additional mutations were made within regions observed to contact the α1 helix. In the current work, the effects of mutations within the neighboring N-terminal domain are compared with the effects of mutations within α1. Amino acid substitution mutants were constructed using the Stratagene QuikChange Mutagenesis kit. Primers were designed to incorporate 2–4 clustered, site-directed substitutions via polymerase chain reaction from a pET21a plasmid (Novagen) encoding wild type RAP74 fused to a C-terminal His6 tag. Wild type and mutant proteins were purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography, and the TFIIF complex was reconstituted as described (12Wang B.Q. Kostrub C.F. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 207-214Google Scholar, 13Wang B.Q. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 476-485Google Scholar). Substitution mutations were either multiple alanine replacements or radical charge reversals. The 14YVV16 →14AAA16 mutation contains Y14A, V15A, and V16A substitutions. Similarly, 24KK25 →24EE25 contains K24E and K25E substitutions. In vitro transcription assays were done essentially as described (10Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Google Scholar). An extract of human HeLa cell nuclei (cells purchased from the National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN) served as a source of transcription factors. TFIIF was removed from the extract by immunoprecipitation with anti-RAP74 and anti-RAP30 antibodies (5Finkelstein A. Kostrub C.F. Li J. Chavez D.P. Wang B.Q. Fang S.M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 464-467Google Scholar). Activity was reconstituted by the addition of wild type (wt) or mutant human recombinant TFIIF. The buffer for transcription reactions consisted of 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 12% (w/v) glycerol, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.12 mmEGTA, and 1.2 mm dithiothreitol and contained 60 mm KCl and 12 mm MgCl2. The template for transcription was plasmid pML, carrying the adenovirus major late promoter from position −258 to +196. The template was digested with SmaI endonuclease at position 217 relative to the transcription start site. 10 pmol of recombinant wt or mutant TFIIF extract and 0.8 μg of DNA template were combined in a 20-μl volume and incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. Transcription was initiated with 100 μm ATP, 100 μm CTP, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci per mmol) for 1 min. After pulse labeling, reactions were chased for 30 min with 1 mm each ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP in the presence of 0.25% Sarkosyl. We find that Sarkosyl treatment increases the yield of full-length transcripts, apparently by blocking factors in the extract that induce pausing and/or termination (11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar, 14Lei L. Ren D. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by adding 80 μl of stop solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20 mmEDTA, and 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate containing 40 μg of yeast tRNA per reaction). After extraction with phenol/chloroform and precipitation with ethanol, samples were resuspended in 80% formamide gel loading dye, boiled 2 min, and electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 50% (w/v) urea and Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Band intensities were quantitated using an AmershamBiosciences PhosphorImager. Initiation activities are reported as percent of wild type, with each value representing the average of triplicate measurements and error bars reflecting the standard deviation (Fig. 4). Elongation assays were done as described previously (11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar). The source of transcription factors was an extract derived from human HeLa cells. Bead-immobilized U20 templates were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction amplification from the pML20–42 template (15Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Google Scholar) using an upstream biotinylated primer and immobilized on streptavidin-coated MagneSphere paramagnetic beads (Promega). The C40 DNA is identical to U20, except that C40 has an additional 20-base extension in the CU cassette immediately downstream of the adenovirus major late promoter (1ACTCTCTTCCCCTTCTCTTTCCTTCTCTTCCCTCTCCTCCAAAGGCCTTT50). The U20 or C40 bead template and extract were combined and incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. Transcription was extended to U20 or C40 with a 10 min pulse with 20 μm dATP, 1 mm ApC dinucleotide, 100 μm UTP, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]CTP. Complexes were then washed twice with 500 μl of transcription buffer containing 1% Sarkosyl, 0.5 mKCl, and 0.003% Nonidet P-40 to remove nascent elongation and termination factors and twice with 500 μl of transcription buffer containing 60 mm KCl but lacking MgCl2. Beads were collected with a magnetic particle separator. Complexes were resuspended in an appropriate volume of transcription buffer containing 60 mm KCl and 12 mm MgCl2 and aliquoted into individual 15-μl samples. 10 pmol of wt or mutant TFIIF was added to the reaction mixtures, with transcription buffer added in the no factor control. Elongation was continued from U20 or C40 by the addition of 1 mm each ATP, CTP, UTP, and GTP. Reactions were stopped at 5, 10, 20, or 40 s by the addition of 50 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Beads were collected with a magnetic particle separator, and the supernatant was removed. Beads were resuspended in 10 μl of 80% formamide gel-loading buffer, boiled 5 min, and supernatant loaded into a 9% polyacrylamide gel containing 50% (w/v) urea and Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Gel images were visualized using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. C40 elongation complexes initiated from the adenovirus major late promoter were prepared on bead templates as described above. Each 10-μl reaction contained C40 complexes in transcription buffer containing 12 mm MgCl2. Reactions were incubated with 12 pmol of wt TFIIF, I176A TFIIF, or buffer for 20–60 min in the presence of 20 μm CTP and UTP. The time varies because of the time required to process individual samples using the KinTek Rapid Chemical Quench-Flow instrument (RQF-3). 10 μl of 200 μm ATP (100 μm working concentration) was added in transcription buffer for 30 or 120 s to extend the elongation complex to the A43 position. The time of ATP addition was 30 s in the presence of wt TFIIF, 120 s in the presence of I176A, and 120 s in the absence of the elongation factor. For each protocol, times for ATP addition were optimized for conversion of the C40 complex to A43 and for the efficiency and consistency of subsequent elongation to G44 and G45. After about 20 s the efficiency of elongation from A43 reaches a steady state that is maintained for several minutes; thus, samples processed with different ATP pulse times can be compared. During the short incubation with ATP, 15 μl of the reaction mix was rapidly injected into the left sample port of the KinTek RQF-3 instrument. Initiation of the reaction induces mixing of the sample with 15 μl of 500 μm GTP, which was previously loaded into the right sample port of the RQF-3 instrument (250 μm GTP working concentration). Reactions were quenched with 0.5 m EDTA at the times indicated. Beads were collected with a magnetic particle separator and resuspended in formamide gel loading dyes. Samples were electrophoresed in 16% polyacrylamide gels containing 50% (w/v) urea and analyzed as described above. Recovery of samples was sometimes variable; therefore, for each sample lane the sum of all transcripts generated from A43 was determined as 100%. Site-directed mutations were constructed throughout the conserved N-terminal region of human RAP74. In all, 68 residues were substituted between amino acids 1–129. Two deletions (29–227 and 62–227) were constructed within a 1–227 C-terminal truncation, because it was previously known that RAP74 (1–227) has near wild type activity in most in vitro assays (10Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Google Scholar, 11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar, 14Lei L. Ren D. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Google Scholar). All other mutations were made in full-length RAP74-(1–517), including a large internal deletion, Δ56–93, described below. Mutants were tested for accurate initiation activity in a HeLa cell extract that was depleted of TFIIF by immunoprecipitation with anti-RAP30 and anti-RAP74 antibodies (Fig.2). Accurate initiation activity was restored by the addition of human recombinant TFIIF. NTPs were then added in a pulse-chase protocol in which Sarkosyl is added during the chase to block premature termination and also re-initiation (11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar, 14Lei L. Ren D. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Google Scholar). Sample initiation data are compared for wild type TFIIF, two mutants (89KEFR92 → 89AAAA92and Δ56–93) in which specific contacts between the β4-β5 loop and the α1 helix are disrupted, and a critical and representative mutant within α1 (W164A). The 89KEFR92 →89AAAA92 mutation eliminates all close contacts with Trp-164 observed in the x-ray crystal structure (Fig.2 B), yet 89KEFR92 →89AAAA92 demonstrates near wild type activity in initiation, whereas the α1 mutation W164A has a much more severe defect (Fig. 2 A). Clearly, eliminating strong contacts between the β4-β5 loop and α1 does not have as great an effect on transcription as making a critical substitution in α1, indicating that the β4-β5 loop is not the functional molecular target of the α1 helix or a necessary participant in α1 function. In the Δ56–93 mutation, the entire β4-β5 loop was removed. This alteration produces a significant defect in initiation (56% wt), but one that is not quite so severe as the W164A mutation (30% wt). TFIIF stimulates the average rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II about 5–6-fold (Fig. 3) (11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar, 16Bengal E. Flores O. Krauskopf A. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1195-1206Google Scholar, 17Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Google Scholar). Using bead templates, transcription was initiated from the adenovirus major late promoter in the presence of dATP, ApC dinucleotide, [α-32P]CTP, and UTP to synthesize U20 or C40 elongation complexes (RNAs are 20 nucleotides long ending in a 3′-UMP (U20) or 40 nucleotides long and ending in a 3′-CMP (C40)). Elongation complexes were then stripped of elongation and termination factors with Sarkosyl and salt. After re-equilibration with transcription buffer, recombinant TFIIF was added back to reactions, and elongation was continued with 1 mm each NTP for 5, 10, 20, or 40 s. In Fig. 3, some strongly paused C40 complexes remain at the C40 position, but most C40 complexes move forward as a fairly synchronous zone of transcripts. No C40 complexes appear to be arrested, as all advance within 2 min (see Fig. 5). The midpoint of the zone was approximated, as indicated by theblack dots in Fig. 3 A. The average elongation rate was then determined as the slope of the average transcript length plotted against the time of transcript extension (Fig. 3 B). The average rate of RNA polymerase II elongation is determined to be more than 5-fold as fast in the presence of wt TFIIF as compared with its absence. A single amino acid change in the α1 helix (I176A) produced a protein with only about twice the average elongation rate of RNA polymerase II in the absence of factor, demonstrating the severe elongation defect of α1 mutations but confirming that I176A TFIIF interacts with and stimulates the RNA polymerase II elongation complex (10Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Google Scholar, 11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar). Significantly, however, the89KEFR92 → 89AAAA92and even the large Δ56–93 deletion score as wild type in elongation stimulation activity. Despite tight packing of α1 to β4 and β5 in the crystal structure, the molecular target of α1 during elongation cannot be the β4-β5 loop, which is damaged or removed in these mutants.Figure 5Elongation defect of an α1 mutation (I176A). A running start, two-bond elongation assay was done through the RNA sequence40CAAAGGCCUUU50 to monitor rates of G44 and G45 synthesis using a KinTek Rapid Chemical Quench-Flow instrument. Purified C40 elongation complexes were advanced to A43 by addition of 100 μm ATP for 30 s (wt TFIIF) or 120 s (I176A TFIIF or no factor). 250 μm GTP was then added for the indicated times, and reactions were quenched.

The data shown are representative of several experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In Fig. 4, initiation and elongation data are shown for a large number of TFIIF mutations within the N-terminal region. Deletion of amino acids 1–28 from the N terminus of RAP74 (29–227) causes a severe defect in both initiation and elongation. Surprisingly, further deletion to create RAP74-(62–227) was not quite so defective in initiation or elongation. Because the larger deletion was not expected to be more active, clones and proteins were reconfirmed. Apparently, both deletions damage the RAP74-RAP30 dimer interface, but the 29–227 fragment may have a more awkward conformation, causing its greater transcriptional defects. Results with these deletion mutations attest to the expected importance of the unique RAP74-RAP30 dimer interface in maintaining TFIIF conformation. Some other mutants, such as triple alanine substitutions98WLL100 → 98AAA100and 124YYI126 →124AAA126, have significant defects in transcription, but these mutations are not quite as severe as single alanine substitutions within or immediately adjacent to α1 (L155A, W164A, N172A, I176A, and M177A). The defects of98WLL100 → 98AAA100and 124YYI126 →124AAA126 in initiation might be attributed to defects in the RAP74-RAP30 dimer interface and to resulting defects in the transcription complex assembly. Indeed,98WLL100 → 98AAA100and 124YYI126 →124AAA126 both show defects in the assembly of a TBP-TFIIB-RNA polymerase II-TFIIF complex (data not shown).98WLL100 → 98AAA100shows no defect in elongation stimulation, although it has a significant defect in initiation. Many multiple alanine substitutions and some multiple radical charge reversals show little effect on transcription. Apparently, most of the function of the RAP74 N terminus (amino acids 1–120) can be accounted for by a role in forming the RAP74-RAP30 dimer interface, as indicated by the crystal structure. The β4-β5 loop is the most prominent feature of the N-terminal domain of RAP74 that diverges from the dimer interface, and this structure may have a subtle role in initiation that does not appear to be important for elongation. In the crystal structure, the β4-β5 loop interacts with α1, but, as we argue above, β4-β5 cannot be the functional molecular target of αl. However, the loop charge reversal mutant 80RRKK83 →80EEEE83 and loop deletion Δ56–93 have only about 60% wt activity in initiation, although they show approximate wt activity in elongation. It is possible, therefore, that the β4-β5 loop functionally contacts one of the general initiation factors not present in the Sarkosyl-washed elongation complex. Relating the TFIIF crystal structure to our functional analysis of RAP74 mutants refocused our attention on the α1 helix. In Fig. 5, rates for RNA polymerase II elongation are compared in the presence of wt TFIIF, I176A TFIIF and in the absence of elongation factor. The protocol we employed is referred to as a “running start, two-bond” elongation assay. The running start was necessary to measure the most rapid elongation rates, and two bonds were monitored because rates of G44 and G45 synthesis yield distinct information. 2Y. A. Nedialkov, X. Q. Gong, and Z. F. Burton, unpublished data. A kinetic lag in the first appearance of G45, for instance, indicates a slow step that occurs after formation of the G44 bond but before rapid formation of the G45 bond can commence. C40 elongation complexes were formed on bead templates and washed with Sarkosyl as described above. C40 complexes were incubated with 12 pmol TFIIF and 20 μm CTP and UTP. The running start is initiated by adding 100 μm ATP for 30 or 120 s to advance C40 to the A41, A42, and A43 positions. The time of ATP incubation was 30 s with wt TFIIF, 120 s with I176A TFIIF, and 120 s with no factor. For each protocol the ATP pulse time was optimized for conversion of C40 to A43. With time delays from 20 s to several minutes, A43 complexes are extended efficiently, so the 30 and 120 s stall times represent a reasonable comparison between samples. During the ATP pulse, complexes were quickly transferred into the sample port of the KinTek Rapid Chemical Quench-Flow instrument and then mixed with 250 μm GTP, allowing further extension to G44, G45, and longer products for the times indicated. TFIIF stimulates the rates of G44 and G45 synthesis (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, TFIIF accelerates a slow step that occurs after chemistry in the transition between one bond and the next. In the presence of wt TFIIF the following events occur. 1) A significant burst of G44 synthesis is observed at 0.002 s. 2) The peak of G44 accumulation is observed at about 0.02 s. 3) The first appearance of G45 is observed at 0.05 s. 4) The peak of G45 accumulation is observed at 0.1–0.5 s. There appears to be a delay in the first appearance of G45, because G44 is present from the very earliest time points; but the first appearance of G45 is delayed until 0.02–0.05 s. Therefore, the most rapid synthesis rates for the G44 bond must be faster than the most rapid synthesis rates for G45. If this were not the case, the first appearance of G45 would be expected by the 0.005 to 0.01 s time points, at which no G45 is detectable (Fig.5 A; lanes 3–6). The delay in the first appearance of G45 provides evidence for a slow step after phosphodiester bond formation.2 In the presence of TFIIF carrying the deleterious I176A mutation in the RAP74 subunit or in the absence of TFIIF, the following events occur. 1) The rates of G44 synthesis are slowed. 2) The rates of G44 disappearance are slowed. 3) The first appearance of G45 is delayed. Quantification of the gel data (Fig. 5, B–D) supports these conclusions and yields further insight into wt TFIIF function and I176A TFIIF defects. Fig. 5 B shows the rates of escape from the A43 position. In the presence of wt TFIIF, about 60% of A43 complexes extend rapidly to G44 (within 0.1 s), indicating that these A43 complexes were poised on the active synthesis pathway. On the other hand, about 40% of A43 elongation complexes are strongly paused when GTP is added, but all of these complexes advance within 120 s (Fig. 5 A, lanes 11 and 12). TFIIF wt stimulates a much faster rate of A43 disappearance than observed in the absence of an elongation factor (Fig. 5 B), indicating, as others have noted (16Bengal E. Flores O. Krauskopf A. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1195-1206Google Scholar, 18Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1465-1475Google Scholar, 19Tan S. Aso T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25684-25691Google Scholar), that TFIIF suppresses pausing. The I176A mutant does not support the pause-suppression function of TFIIF and instead supports elongation rates similar to those observed in the absence of an elongation factor (Fig. 5 B). Fig.5 C shows passage of elongation complexes through the G44 position. TFIIF wt increases the rate of appearance and dramatically enhances the rate of disappearance of G44. By contrast, the I176A mutant supports a G44 synthesis rate that is significantly slower than wild type TFIIF and similar to elongation in the absence of factor. I176A TFIIF, however, does stimulate overall elongation rates (Figs. 3and 4) and, in the running start assay, the mutant is observed to facilitate escape from the G44 position when compared with RNA polymerase II in the absence of the elongation factor (Fig.5 A, lanes 19–21 and 27-29;Fig. 5 C). Wild type TFIIF strongly stimulates the G45 synthesis rate and decreases the time for the first G45 appearance (Fig. 5 D). The kinetic lag in the G45 appearance is less than 0.05 s in the presence of wt TFIIF, but this lag is 0.05–0.1 s in the presence of I176A or in the absence of elongation factor. The lag in first G45 appearance reflects a slow step between formation of one bond and the next that occurs after phosphodiester bond formation and is regulated by TFIIF.2 In the running start protocol, this slow step is clearly observed in the first appearance of G45 but is not observed in G44 synthesis rates, because this slow step is complete after the 30 or 120 s delay at A43. In the presence of TFIIF, RNA polymerase II negotiates the slow transition between bonds efficiently. In the presence of I176A TFIIF, this transition becomes much more challenging for RNA polymerase II (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 6–8 with lanes 17–19; Fig.5 D). In the absence of factor, the transition is also slow, further demonstrating regulation of this slow step between bonds by TFIIF. A large number of radical amino acid substitutions were introduced in the conserved N-terminal domain of human RAP74 without clear identification of particularly interesting new mutants. It appears that most functional outcomes induced by N-terminal domain mutations are accounted for by damage to the RAP74-RAP30 dimer interface. The β4-β5 loop of RAP74, however, diverges from the dimer core and packs tightly with the α1 helix in the crystal structure. This is an intriguing association, because α1 was previously shown to be important for both initiation and elongation (10Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Google Scholar, 11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, β4-β5 and the intervening loop do not appear to participate in α1 function, because radical damage to the β5-α1 interaction (89KEFR92 →89AAAA92) or complete removal of β4-β5 and the intervening loop (Δ56–93) did not have as severe defects in initiation or elongation as critical point mutations in α1 (L155A, W164A, N172A, I176A, and M177A). Therefore, we conclude that the close association of the β4-β5 loop and α1 seen in the x-ray crystal structure does not represent the form of α1 that is active in initiation and elongation of RNA chains. On the other hand, interaction with the β4-β5 loop could modulate α1 function. For instance, binding to β5 may shelter the otherwise exposed tryptophan W164 when α1 is not bound to its transcriptional target (Fig. 2 B). We, therefore, suggest a regulatory role for the β4 and β5 interaction with α1. We further suggest that α1 must free itself of contact with the β4-β5 loop while participating in transcription. We note that the Δ56–93 deletion is somewhat defective in supporting initiation, perhaps indicating interaction of the loop with another initiation factor. Because the defect of Δ56–93 in initiation approximates the defect of a radical charge reversal mutant in the loop between β4 and β5 (80RRKK83 →80EEEE83), elimination of80RRKK83 in Δ56–93 could account for its initiation defect (Fig. 4). It may be that participation of the β4-β5 loop in the proper assembly of the preinitiation complex results in freeing the α1 helix for its roles during initiation and elongation. Because substitution with alanine is consistent with maintaining α-helical structures (20Niu W. Zhou Y. Dong Q. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 595-602Google Scholar, 21Tang H. Sun X. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1119-1124Google Scholar), critical substitutions within α1 (L155A, W164A, N172A, I176A, and M177A) are unlikely to disrupt local protein secondary structure. Furthermore, these critical substitutions do not appear to affect major interactions with RAP30 or the preinitiation complex (10Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Google Scholar, 11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar). We suggest, therefore, that L155, W164, N172, I176, and M177 may be directly involved in contacting a common molecular target in initiation and elongation complexes. Each of these proposed contacts appears to be of critical importance, because L155A, W164A, N172A, I176A, and M177A all have approximately the same defect in initiation and elongation as an eight-amino acid deletion within α1 (Δ170–177) (10Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Google Scholar, 11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar). The current work fails to identify the molecular target for α1, although the β4-β5 loop was implicated by the crystal structure. It has been argued that the target of α1 must reside in TFIIF, RNA polymerase II, or template DNA, because these are the components in common comparing initiation and elongation complexes, and mutations in α1 have similar defects in initiation and elongation (10Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Google Scholar, 11Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar). To date, no contacts to other regions within TFIIF can be identified for α1 that appear to participate in its transcriptional functions. Furthermore, TFIIF carrying critical lesions in α1 binds to RNA polymerase II and forms a preinitiation complex of TBP, TFIIB, and RNA polymerase II with no apparent alteration of complex mobility in gels or defect in assembly even at low TFIIF concentrations. Thus, if α1 targets RNA polymerase II, this interaction does not appear to be necessary for tight TFIIF-RNA polymerase II binding or complex assembly (10Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Google Scholar). Perhaps α1 targets DNA in initiation and elongation complexes, although no clear demonstration of this hypothesis is yet available. It appears from this study and from the crystal structure that α1 must be freed from tight contact with the β4-β5 loop to swing on a flexible pivot to target a specific region of RNA polymerase II or template DNA. In this regard, it is interesting to compare α1 helices from different organisms. In every case, PHD secondary structure prediction indicates that these regions are extended α-helices, although the primary sequences are somewhat divergent (Fig. 1). These studies have refocused our attention on α1 of RAP74 as an important functional motif in transcriptional mechanisms. As a preliminary step, we have compared a critical α1 mutant (I176A) to wt TFIIF in a running start, two-bond transcriptional elongation assay. Our results suggest that TFIIF stimulates escape from paused complexes and also accelerates a slow step that follows phosphodiester bond formation. Further investigation will be required to fully characterize the multiple effects of TFIIF on elongation and the severe defects of α1 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2046286001,"It is clear from the biology of eosinophilia that a specific regulatory mechanism must exist. Because interleukin-5 (IL5) is the key regulatory cytokine, it follows that a gene-specific control of IL5 expression must exist that differs even from closely related cytokines such as IL4. Two features of IL5 induction make it unique compared with other cytokines; first, induction by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which inhibits other T-cell-derived cytokines, and second, sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibitors, which have no effect on other cytokines.

Such a close relationship between a gene and a biological effect is unusual in the cytokine field where pleiotropy and redundancy are more common. By mediating eosinophilia, IL5 is involved in the pathogenesis of a number of allergic diseases, most notably asthma (3De Monchy J.G. Kauffman H.F. Venge P. Koeter G.H. Jansen H.M. Sluiter H.J. De Vries K. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 131: 373-376Google Scholar), rhinitis, and dermatitis (4Leung D.Y. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 163: 157-167Google Scholar). Although IL5 is reported to be produced by mast cells and eosinophils, the regulation of eosinophilia is primarily mediated by T-lymphocytes, which produce IL5 after activation (5Karlen S. De Boer M.L. Lipscombe R.J. Lutz W. Mordvinov V. Sanderson C.J. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 16: 227-247Google Scholar). Activation of T-cells requires the interaction of the T-cell receptor with antigen, which leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration and activation of protein kinase C (6Perlmutter R.M. Levin S.D. Appleby M.W. Anderson S.J. Alberola-Ila J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 451-499Google Scholar). A second signal provided by antigen-presenting cells is also required for optimal activation (7Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Google Scholar). Antigen-presenting-stimulated T-cells produce a wide range of cytokines, and IL5 is often but not always co-expressed with cytokines such as IL4 and IL13 (8Sanderson C.J. De Boer M. Senna-Salerno M.

It is not clear why certain antigens induce IL5 and others do not; however, this indicates that the gene is individually regulated, and control mechanisms for IL5 expression can be based on antigen-specific T-cell activation. Efficient production of IL5 in vitro requires activation by both phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and a second signaling pathway, which can be stimulated by anti-CD28 antibody (9Schandene L.

Takatsu K. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1175-1181Google Scholar, 12Lee H.J. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Naito Y. Nishida J. Arai N. Arai K.-i. Yokota T. J.

PMA/anti-CD28 stimulation activates expression of a variety of other cytokine genes including IL2, IL3, IL4, IL10, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (14Abbas A.K. Murphy K.M. Sher A. Nature. 1996; 383: 787-793Google Scholar). However, cAMP has an inhibitory effect on IL2, IL3, IL10, and GM-CSF (12Lee H.J. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Naito Y. Nishida J. Arai N. Arai K.-i. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6135-6142Google Scholar, 15Chen D. Rothenberg E.V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 931-942Google Scholar, 16Derigs H.G. Burgess G.S. Klinberg D. Nahreini T.S. Mechizuki D.Y. Williams D.E. Boswell H.S. Leukemia. 1990; 4: 471-479Google Scholar) and no effect on IL4 (17Novak T.J. Rothenberg E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9353-9357Google Scholar). This suggests that IL5 expression is controlled by at least two independent costimulatory pathways. One of these is the CD28 pathway, which may be regarded as a common pathway for activation of cytokine genes. The other is the cAMP-dependent pathway, which in the context of T-cell cytokine genes, appears to be unique for induction of IL5 expression. IL5, like many other cytokines, is regulated at the transcriptional level (5Karlen S. De Boer M.L. Lipscombe R.J. Lutz W. Mordvinov V. Sanderson C.J. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 16: 227-247Google Scholar). Although control of IL5 expression is not fully understood, there is increasing evidence that unique mechanisms are involved in activation of the gene. For example, T-cell hybrids expressing IL5 and no other lymphokine have been produced (18Warren D.J. Sanderson C.J. Immunology. 1985; 54: 615-623Google Scholar), treatment of Th2 cells with IL2 induces IL5 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression but does not induce detectable amount of IL4 or GM-CSF messengers (19Bohjanen P.R. Okajima M. Hodes R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5283-5287Google Scholar), and T-cells purified from peripheral blood of non-atopic asthmatic patients secrete elevated amounts of IL5 but not of IL4 (20Corrigan C.J. Kay A.B. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 501-505Google Scholar). In addition, protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide (CHX) and anisomycin completely inhibit IL5 mRNA synthesis in primary T-cells and the murine T-cell clone D10.G4.1, but they do not inhibit the expression of IL2, IL3, IL4, IL10, and GM-CSF mRNAs in these cells (21Van Straaten J.F. Dokter W.H. Stulp B.K. Vellenga E. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 229-234Google Scholar, 22Stranick K.S. Payvandi F. Zambas D.N. Umland S.P. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20575-20582Google Scholar, 23Naora H. Young I.G. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 597-602Google Scholar). Thus, at least one protein critical for the induction of IL5 gene expression, but not for expression of other cytokine genes, is newly synthesized in response to T-cell stimulation. In this study we sought to identify the mechanism behind this dependence on de novo protein synthesis because this represents an important factor in the specific regulation of the gene. The 5′-flanking regions of the human and murine IL5 RNA initiation sites contain a number of cis-regulatory elements that are involved in the control of IL5 production (8Sanderson C.J. De Boer M. Senna-Salerno M. Schwenger G.T. Thomas M. Mordvinov V. Karlen S. Sanderson C.J. Lung Biology in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 267-287Google Scholar). Although these promoter elements contribute to the overall transcriptional activity of IL5, the conserved lymphokine element 0 (CLE0) in particular plays a very important role in IL5 gene transcription. Studies performed on both murine and human IL5 regulation demonstrate through deletion and mutation analysis that CLE0 is critical to IL5 expression (24Lee H.J. O' Garra A. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2343-2352Google Scholar, 25Lee H.J. Masuda E.S. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17541-17550Google Scholar, 26Naora H. Young I.G. Blood. 1994; 83: 3620-3628Google Scholar, 27Siegel M.D. Zhang D.H. Ray P. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24548-24555Google Scholar, 28Thomas M.A. Mordvinov V.A. Sanderson C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 300-307Google Scholar). Considering the critical role of CLE0 in IL5 expression, it seemed possible that the factor(s) involved in its activation might be synthesized de novo and provide the target for CHX inhibition. The human T-cell line PER-117, which inducibly expresses IL2, IL4, and IL5 (29Kees U.R. Peroni S.E. Ranford P.R. Ford J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 168: 1-8Google Scholar, 30Mordvinov V. Peroni S. De Boer M. Kees U. Sanderson C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 228: 163-168Google Scholar), provides a useful model for the study of IL5 expression. As in primary T-cells there is no detectable constitutive expression of IL5, but expression can be induced with PMA and further enhanced by cAMP and CaI. The transcription factors Oct-1, Oct-2, and AP-1 are involved in activation of IL5 transcription and exert their effects through CLE0 (28Thomas M.A. Mordvinov V.A. Sanderson C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 300-307Google Scholar). This study shows that, as in primary T-cells, IL5 gene expression in PER-117 cells is de novo protein synthesis-dependent, and CHX completely inhibits IL5 but not IL4 mRNA synthesis. Stimulation of the cells initiates de novo synthesis of the AP-1 complex binding to CLE0. Differences in the activation requirements for Oct-2 and AP-1 suggest that the AP-1 complex and not Oct-2 is of primary importance in the induction of IL5 expression. PER-117 cells (29Kees U.R. Peroni S.E. Ranford P.R. Ford J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 168: 1-8Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (Trace), 100 mmEagle's nonessential amino acid solution (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), 75 mm monothioglycerol (Sigma), and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3 (Invitrogen)). The cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for 15 min and stimulated with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 1 mm cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and 0.25 μm calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) for various time points. IL5 was determined using Baf cells carrying human IL5Rα and the expressed viability assay (31Coombe D.R. Nakhoul A.M. Stevenson S.M. Peroni S.E. Sanderson C.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 215: 145-150Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from 107cells using the RNAeasy® mini kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (RT) (Promega). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the cDNA was performed with the following specific primers: IL4, AGTGCGATATCACCTTACAGGAGA and TTAAAATATTCAGCTCGAACAC; IL5, ACCTTGGCACTGCTTTCTACTCAT and AGAAACTCTTGCAGGTAGTCTAGG; Fra-2, GCTTCTACGGTGAGGAGCCCCTGCAC and GGGTTACAGAGCCAGCAGAGTGGGGG; and Jun D, CGCAGCCTCAAACCCTGCCTTTCC and CAAACAGGAATGTGGACTCGTAGC. Primers specific for β-actin were obtained from Clontech. The PCR mixture contained 1 μl of cDNA, 1.0 μm each primer, 0.5 mmMgCl2 (2.5 mm for IL4), 0.2 mmdeoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 1 unit Thermus thermophilus DNA polymerase (Promega) in Mg2+-free reaction buffer. The tubes were transferred into the preheated (94 °C) thermocycler (PTC-100™, MJ Research), and DNA was denatured for 3 min. The samples were then subjected to 40 cycles of amplification at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min (5 cycles at 58 °C for 1 min and 35 cycles at 55 °C for 1 min for Fra-2), and 72 °C for 1 min. A two-step PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 70 °C for 2 min) was performed in the case of JunD. A final incubation of 72 °C for 10 min was carried out for all samples. PCR products were fractionated on 1.5% agarose gel and photographed. Nuclear proteins used in EMSA and WB analysis were isolated as described by Schreiber et al. (32Schreiber E. Matthias P. Mueller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar) with the following modification; protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm Na3V04 (Sigma), and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) were added to the reaction buffers just before lysis. After lysis nuclei were separated, and cytoplasmic proteins were further purified by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the DC Bio-Rad protein assay in three independent assays. The mean of these assays was used in subsequent experiments. Standard EMSA binding reactions contained 3 μg of nuclear extract, 60 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 μg poly(dI·dC), 12% glycerol, and 25 fmol of32P end-labeled oligonucleotide probe (31Coombe D.R. Nakhoul A.M. Stevenson S.M. Peroni S.E. Sanderson C.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 215: 145-150Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide used as a probe was human IL5 CLE0, spanning nucleotides −59 to −38 of the IL5 promoter and containing the sequence GAAATTATTCATTTCCTCAAAG (one strand shown). Probe preparation, protein-DNA binding reactions, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as described (33Karlen S. Beard P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4296-4306Google Scholar). DNA supershift experiments were carried out using antisera specifically directed against Oct-1 (sc-232), Oct-2 (sc-233), c-Jun/AP-1 (sc-44, reactive with all Jun members), c-Jun (sc-45), Jun B (sc-46), Jun D (sc-74), c-Fos (sc-253, reactive with all Fos members), c-Fos (sc-52), Fos B (sc-48), Fra-1 (sc-605), and Fra-2 (sc-604) supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. This involved the inclusion of antibodies (2 μg) to the reaction mixture and incubation for 2 h on ice before the addition of the labeled IL5 CLE0 probe. To perform WB, 50 μg of cytoplasmic fraction or 28 μg of nuclear proteins were fractionated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membranes. Antiseras listed above (dilutions recommended by supplier) were used to detect protein expression. The amount of Oct-1 in each lane was used as loading controls. After incubation with the first antibody, the proteins were detected with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and chromogen substrate (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The PCR products, EMSA, or WB gel image was generated using a Kodak DC200 digital camera and Micrografx Picture Publisher 5.0 and printed on an HP laser jet 6p/6mp printer. Levels of formation of EMSA complexes were quantified by densitometric analysis using Scion Image, Release Beta 4.0.2. The pCR2.1hIL5p plasmid was used to isolate a 553-bp hIL5 promoter fragment. The fragment BamHI (−509) to EcoRI (+44) from pCR2.1hIL5p was then subcloned in the BamHI/EcoRI site of pSP72 (Promega) creating the pSP-hIL5 construct. The pSP-hIL5 construct was subsequently digested with XbaI andBglII, isolated, and ligated intoNheI/BglII digested pGL3-Basic (Promega). The resulting construct was called hIL5p and was used as the hIL5 reporter construct for transfection experiments. The Fra2 and JunD antisense constructs were made by ligating the PCR fragments obtained using the Fra2 and JunD primers described earlier into pGEM-T (Promega) then digesting the resulting plasmids with SalI/XhoI and inserting the fragments into similarly cut pSI (Promega). The final constructs pSIasFra2 and pSIasJunD contain 224 and 292-bp fragments, respectively, in reverse orientation. All transfections were carried out in triplicate. 10 μg of both antisense construct and hIL5 reporter construct DNA were electroporated at 960 microfarads and 280 V into 107 PER-117 cells in 400 μl of growth media using the Bio-Rad gene pulser. After electroporation, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for a period of 4 h before activation. For T-cell activation, PMA (Sigma), cAMP (Sigma), and CaI (Sigma) were used at concentrations of 10 ng/ml, 1 mm, and 0.25 μm respectively. After an additional incubation period of 16 h, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 μl of reaction buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 250 μm lithium-CoA (Sigma), 500 μm sodium luciferin (Molecular Probes), and 0.5% Triton X-100. Luciferase activity was measured in a Victor 1420 multilabel reader (Wallac, Finland). To investigate whether the activation of IL5 transcription in PER-117 cells was sensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis, cells were treated with CHX. RT-PCR analysis showed no IL5 or IL4 mRNA in resting cells (Fig. 1, lane 1). Treating the cells for 4 h with 10 ng/ml PMA and 0.25 μm CaI induced synthesis of these mRNAs (lane 2). CHX completely inhibited IL5 mRNA synthesis but had no effect on IL4 (lane 3). This indicates that, as in primary T-cells, at least one protein critical for the induction of IL5, but not IL4, transcription is newly synthesized in stimulated PER-117 cells. It has previously been shown that PMA/cAMP and PMA/CaI stimulation induce binding of an AP-1 complex consisting of Jun D and Fra-2 to CLE0 (28Thomas M.A. Mordvinov V.A. Sanderson C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 300-307Google Scholar). Here we also show that three protein complexes were formed on a CLE0 probe with PMA-stimulated cell nuclear extracts (Fig.2, lane 1). An antibody specific to the Oct-1 protein inhibited formation of the low mobility complex (lane 2). Similarly, an antibody to Oct-2 shifted the high mobility complex (lane 3). The third complex was partially inhibited by anti-Jun D and anti-Fra-2 (lanes 4and 5) but not antibodies against c-Jun (lane 6) or other members of the Jun/Fos family (data not shown). Combined shift with both anti-Jun D and anti-Fra-2 completely removed the AP-1 complex (data not shown). These results indicate that Oct-1, Oct-2, and AP-1 (Jun D and Fra-2) bind to the CLE0 in PMA induced PER-117 cells. EMSA were carried out with CLE0 probe, and nuclear extracts were prepared from PER117 cells stimulated under different conditions for 0, 2, 6, 12, and 18 h. Although different stimulation induces the same AP-1 complex, there were differences in the intensity and time course of interaction of AP-1 proteins to CLE0 (Fig.3 A). PMA stimulation gives a weak induction of AP-1, which reaches a maximum after 12 h. PMA/cAMP induced AP-1 more rapidly, peaking between 6 and 12 h and declining by 18 h. In contrast, PMA/CaI induced a more intense band, which was maintained for at least 18 h. To determine whether the time course of binding of AP-1 factors to CLE0 correlated with IL5 protein production, densitometry analysis of AP-1 binding to CLE0 was graphed with IL5 protein production over time (Fig. 3 B). The production of IL5 did correlate with the pattern of AP-1 binding, suggesting that AP-1 is critical for IL5 expression. A combination of all three stimuli (Fig. 3 A) provided the best conditions for AP-1 induction and has been shown to induce the highest levels of IL5 production (data not shown). In contrast, Oct-2 binding did not correlate with the production of IL5 protein. For example, Oct-2 always appeared later than IL5 protein and is not binding under PMA/cAMP stimulation, where IL5 is produced. This suggests that Oct-2 is not involved in all signaling pathways and that different signaling pathways probably use alternate combinations of factors. CHX completely inhibited the formation of AP-1 and Oct-2 complexes (Fig.3 A), suggesting that de novo synthesis is involved in inducible protein binding to the CLE0. To confirm that the CLE0-binding proteins were synthesized after cell activation, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from resting and stimulated cells and subjected to Western blot analysis. Similar amounts of Oct-1 were observed in cytoplasmic extracts of resting and activated cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–4). Fra-2 was only detectable in the cytoplasm of PMA/cAMP-stimulated cells (lane 3). Oct-2 was present after activation except when cAMP was included (lanes 2 and4). Jun D was not detected in cytoplasmic extracts (data not shown). Analysis of the nuclear extracts showed that Oct-1 was constitutively present (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–5). In contrast, Jun D and Fra-2 protein was not detected in the nuclei of resting cells. Fra-2 was induced by all stimulations but was only detected after 6 h (lanes 3, 7, and11), whereas Jun D was detected after 2 h (lanes 2, 6, and 10). Both cAMP and CaI enhanced PMA-induced Fra-2 synthesis (compare lanes 3–5,7–9, and 11–13). However these coactivators did not affect PMA-induced Jun D. Oct-2 was present in resting cells, and it was further induced by stimulation with PMA or PMA/CaI (lanes 1–5 and 10–13). Treatment of the cells with CHX abolished the induction of Fra-2, Jun D, and Oct-2 (Fig.4 C). RT-PCR for Fra-2 and Jun D mRNA in activated PER-117 cells indicates the clear induction of Fra-2 transcription compared with Jun D (Fig5). The latter shows some constitutive expression (lane 1), and although no protein could be detected in unstimulated cells by Western blot (Fig. 4 B), this suggests that it is the production of Fra-2, which is rate-limiting for IL5 expression. Antisense experiments were carried out by co-transfecting constructs expressing antisense sequences for JunD and Fra-2 with a 500-bp hIL5 reporter construct (hIL5p), and the effect on luciferase activity was measured (Fig 6). The effect of the antisense or control constructs on the hIL5 500-bp promoter is shown as fold. The Fra-2 antisense construct reduced activity of the hIL5p construct by up to 75% the level of the hIL5p construct co-transfected with the control vector. This reduction was observed in PMA, PMA/cAMP, and PMA/CaI-stimulated cells. The JunD antisense construct had no effect under any of the stimulation conditions. The significance of IL5 in the production of eosinophils suggests a unique and tight control of gene expression. However, the gene-specific mechanisms of IL5 regulation are poorly understood. We report that de novo synthesis of AP-1 proteins, Fra-2, and Jun D controls activation of human IL5 CLE0 in T-cells. This identifies a gene-specific mechanism of induction of IL5 transcription and a regulatory mechanism involved in formation of the AP-1 complex on the IL5 promoter. Considering the tight control of IL5 expression as well as the similarity in the development of eosinophilia in different species, it might be expected that the specific regulatory element would be highly conserved. However, it is surprising that the flanking region of the human and mouse gene has very limited homology. The region −20 to −80 is highly conserved, but upstream and 3′ regions give little indication of common elements that might be involved in the specific regulation of the gene. This conserved proximal region of the IL5 promoter harbors a cluster of regulatory sequences composed of CLE0 and GATA sites. Both of these sites act as positive regulatory elements and are critical for IL5 gene expression. The GATA element located immediately upstream of the CLE0 was shown to complex with transcription factor GATA-3. This factor was reported to drive development of Th2 cells and directly activate transcription of IL4 and IL5 genes (24Lee H.J. O' Garra A. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2343-2352Google Scholar, 27Siegel M.D. Zhang D.H. Ray P. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24548-24555Google Scholar, 34Zheng W. Flavell R.A.

Immunol. 1999; 91: 134-144Google Scholar), suggesting that the GATA site is an essential, but “nonspecific” part of the proximal IL5 regulatory complex. IL5 CLE0 and the interactions with Octamer and AP-1 factors are a good candidate for a gene-specific switch (27Siegel M.D. Zhang D.H. Ray P. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24548-24555Google Scholar, 28Thomas M.A. Mordvinov V.A. Sanderson C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 300-307Google Scholar, 39Karlen S. D'Ercole M. Sanderson C.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 211-221Google Scholar). Although related elements exist in other cytokine genes, in each case these elements bind a unique protein complex. NF-AT, Fos, and Octamer transcription factors were shown to activate the analogous human IL4 P0 site (40Li-Weber M. Salgame P. Hu C. Davydov I.V. Laur O. Klevenz S. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1380-1389Google Scholar). The GM-CSF CLE0, which differs by only a single base, has been shown to bind AP-1, NF-AT, and Ets (41Masuda E.S. Tokumitsu H. Tsuboi A. Shlomai J. Hung P. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7399-7407Google Scholar, 42Jenkins F. Cockerill P.N. Bohmann D. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1240-1251Google Scholar, 43Thomas R.S. Tymms M.J. Seth A. Shannon M.F. Kola I. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2135-2143Google Scholar). In addition, the important difference between the regulation of IL5 and these other cytokine genes is the sensitivity to inhibition by CHX. It is intriguing that AP-1 binds to GM-CSF CLE0, but expression is not CHX-sensitive. It is possible that AP-1 may not be as crucial to GM-CSF expression as we show here for IL5 or that different family members that are not CHX-sensitive are involved. This study utilized a human T-cell line, PER-117, which inducibly expresses IL5 and IL4. As in primary T-cells there is no detectable constitutive expression of these cytokines, but expression can be induced with PMA in combination with costimulators. Cytokine production is inhibited by dexamethasone and cyclosporin A, so the genes appears to be functioning in a physiological fashion (30Mordvinov V. Peroni S. De Boer M. Kees U. Sanderson C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 228: 163-168Google Scholar). We have used the differential activation of transcription factors by different stimuli to dissect the role of octamer and AP-1 factors on the CLE0 element. The effect of CHX was confirmed for IL5 in PER-117 cells compared with IL4. Thus, as in primary T-cells, IL5 gene transcription in PER-117 cells is de novo protein synthesis-dependent. Taken together these data indicate that the PER-117 cell line is an appropriate model to study signal transduction and transcriptional activation of the human IL5 gene. EMSA results indicated that the constitutively expressed Oct-1 was not significantly affected by CHX, whereas binding of all the inducible proteins (Oct-2, Jun D, and Fra-2) was inhibited by CHX. Thus, any one of these proteins could provide the basis for the mechanism of action of CHX on IL5 expression. Binding of the AP-1 complex to the DNA element was detected as early as 2 h after stimulation, whereas Fra-2 protein was only detected at 6 h, suggesting the EMSA is more sensitive than Western blotting. However, there is a remarkable correlation between AP-1 binding in EMSA and IL5 expression. Differences in induction of the binding proteins suggested a key role for AP-1 in IL5 production because there appeared to be a correlation between the timing and intensity of the bands and the levels of IL5 produced. For example, compare the effect of PMA and PMA/CaI in Fig. 3 B. Also, the more sustained induction of AP-1 by PMA/CaI, resulting in higher IL5 production, compared with the transient effect of PMA/cAMP. This confirms the crucial role of AP-1 in the induction of IL5. The large increase of JunD at 6 h could be explained by the recently reported translational regulation of JunD in combination with the increased expression of JunD mRNA after cell stimulation (44Short J.D. Pfarr C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32697-32705Google Scholar, 45Yazgan O. Pfarr C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29710-29718Google Scholar). Co-stimulation with cAMP induces IL5 but not other cytokines and, thus, provides a model for specific induction of IL5. It is clear from Fig.3 A that PMA/cAMP strongly induces AP-1; thus, at least part of the specificity of cAMP-induced IL5 probably results from the activation of Fra-2 and JunD. Why cAMP inhibits other genes is not clear. The question then is whether one or both of Fra-2 and JunD are synthesized de novo to provide the major difference between the control of IL5 compared with other cytokine genes. JunD mRNA is present in unstimulated cells (Fig. 5), although it does increase after stimulation, suggesting some induction process. However, this constitutively expressed mRNA is not translated, because no protein is detectable in the cytoplasm and is only present in the nucleus after the cells are stimulated (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the production of JunD is inhibited by CHX, indicating that new translation is occurring. The antisense experiments with JunD had no effect, which is consistent with pre-existing protein, but in the absence of clear data on the effectiveness of the antisense, this result needs to be interpreted with caution. Taken together, these experiments point to a requirement for newly synthesized JunD. In addition, the experiments with Fra-2 show conclusively that de novo synthesis is required. After stimulation the protein appears in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, protein production is inhibited by CHX, and the antisense Fra-2 caused a 2–4-fold reduction in IL5 expression. Because Fra-2 appears later than JunD, we propose that it may be the rate-limiting step in IL5 expression. A distinguishing feature of these AP-1 proteins is their ability to be activated by either protein kinase C or protein kinase A pathways (46Gruda M.C. Kovary K. Metz R. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2537-2547Google Scholar,47den Hertog J. de Groot R.P. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W. Nucleics Acids Res. 1992; 20: 125-130Google Scholar). Jun D was activated by the protein kinase C pathway (Fig.4 B, PMA stimulation, lanes 1–5) and apparently not increased by activation of additional pathways. However, for the full induction of Fra-2 (Fig. 4 B, PMA/cAMP stimulation, lanes 6–9) and the AP-1 complex (Fig.3 A) multiple pathways were required. Because the rate-limiting step for IL5 expression appears to be the synthesis of Fra-2, it is clear that multiple pathways are required for efficient IL5 expression. The previous data provide an explanation for the strong requirement for a costimulator in IL5 expression. The EMSA analysis show constitutive binding of Oct-1 and stimulation specific binding of Oct-2 (Fig. 3 A). Because there is only one Oct binding site in the CLE0, it is reasonable to assume that either Oct-1 or Oct-2 bind at any one time, and the appearance of both in EMSA is due to the excess of labeled probe in the EMSA reaction. Although present in the nucleus of unstimulated cells, the failure of Oct-2 to bind to hIL5 CLE0 indicates post-translational modification is required for binding or that a different isoform is induced upon specific stimulation. These results question the role of Oct-2 in IL5 expression as IL5 can be produced in the absence of Oct-2 (Fig. 3, A andB, PMA/cAMP stimulation). However, its importance should not be underestimated. Mutation of the Oct site in CLE0 is just as effective at blocking expression as mutation of the AP-1 site (28Thomas M.A. Mordvinov V.A. Sanderson C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 300-307Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of either Oct-1 or Oct-2 induces IL5 expression in unstimulated PER117 cells (28Thomas M.A. Mordvinov V.A. Sanderson C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 300-307Google Scholar) (hence, in the absence of AP-1); thus, either Oct-1 or Oct-2 appear to be able to support IL5 expression. It should also be noted that mutation of the −400 GATA3 repressor site in the IL5 promoter gives high level constitutive expression, which overrides the need for any of the induced CLE0 transcription factors (48Schwenger G.T. Fournier R. Kok C.C. Mordvinov V.A. Yeoman D. Sanderson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48502-48509Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions it can be expected that different pathways of activation may vary the induction of Oct and AP-1. Finally, it should be noted that other known IL5 transcription activators, GATA-3 and NF-AT (24Lee H.J. O' Garra A. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2343-2352Google Scholar, 27Siegel M.D. Zhang D.H. Ray P. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24548-24555Google Scholar, 36Zhang D.H. Cohn L. Ray P. Bottomly K. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21597-21603Google Scholar, 49De Boer M.L. Mordvinov V.A. Thomas M. Sanderson C.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1221-1236Google Scholar), were observed in resting PER-117 cells (data not shown). This indicates that the modification but not de novo synthesis of these proteins is involved in induction of IL5 transcription. This is also in agreement with the properties of Th2 cytokine-producing cells, where GATA-3 and NF-AT transcription factors were shown to be present in resting cells in inactive form and to be activated by cell stimulation (34Zheng W. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 587-596Google Scholar, 50Chen C.H. Zhang D.H. LaPorte J.M. Ray A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5597-5605Google Scholar, 51Jain J. Miner Z. Rao A. J.

This concept is also relevant to our findings with Oct-2, where it is constitutively present in the nucleus but binding to hCLE0 only occurs after stimulation. All these data support our hypothesis that the highly conserved CLE0 element provides an ON/OFF switch for IL5, and other promoter and 3′ elements modulate the amount of IL5 production in individual T-cells (8Sanderson C.J. De Boer M. Senna-Salerno M. Schwenger G.T. Thomas M. Mordvinov V. Karlen S. Sanderson C.J. Lung Biology in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 267-287Google Scholar). The present results point to a crucial role for CLE0 in the specific regulation of IL5, where the formation of an AP-1 complex is essential, and the rate-limiting step appears to be the synthesis of Fra-2."
https://openalex.org/W2094446067,"Zeste is a Drosophilasequence-specific DNA-binding protein that performs a variety of functions during chromatin-directed gene regulation. Its DNA-binding domain (DBD) was previously identified, but no similarities to established DNA-binding structures are known. Here we present sequence comparisons suggesting that the Zeste-DBD is a novel variant of the tri-helical Myb-DBD. Using band shift assays, we mapped the Zeste-DBD to 76 residues, corresponding to a single Myb repeat of only 50 residues. All residues involved in formation of the hydrophobic core of the Myb domain are conserved in Zeste, suggesting it forms an extended Myb domain. Mutagenesis studies determined (T/C/g)GAGTG(A/G/c) as the consensus Zeste recognition sequence. Reconstituted transcription experiments established that deviations from this optimal consensus compromise transcriptional activation by Zeste. In addition, flanking DNA is critical because Zeste-DBD binding requires a DNA sequence of minimally 16 base pairs, which is much longer than the consensus site. The DNA flanking the consensus is contacted by Zeste through sequence-independent backbone contacts. Interestingly, hydroxyl radical footprinting revealed that the Zeste-DNA backbone contacts all map to one face of the DNA. We compare the DNA-binding properties of Zeste with those of classical tri-helical DBDs harboring a helix-turn-helix motif and suggest a model for Zeste-DNA recognition.

We compare the DNA-binding properties of Zeste with those of classical tri-helical DBDs harboring a helix-turn-helix motif and suggest a model for Zeste-DNA recognition. Recognition of specific DNA sequences is the most fundamental mechanism by which transcriptional regulators are able to function in a gene-specific manner. The Drosophila Zeste protein is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor that belongs to the trithorax group (trxG) 1The abbreviations used are: trxG, trithorax group; PcG, polycomb group; DBD, DNA-binding domain; HTH, helix-turn-helix; Rap1p, repressor activator protein 1; TRF1, telomere repeat binding factor 1; SANT, SWI3, ADA2, N-CoR, and TFIIIB; GST, glutathione S- transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside 1The abbreviations used are: trxG, trithorax group; PcG, polycomb group; DBD, DNA-binding domain; HTH, helix-turn-helix; Rap1p, repressor activator protein 1; TRF1, telomere repeat binding factor 1; SANT, SWI3, ADA2, N-CoR, and TFIIIB; GST, glutathione S- transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside of regulators. The trxG comprises diverse activators that act together with the polycomb group (PcG) of repressors to maintain the correct expression of key developmental genes including the homeotic genes (1Kennison J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 289-303Google Scholar, 2Paro R. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 295-297Google Scholar, 3Pirrotta V. Cell. 1998; 93: 333-336Google Scholar, 4Lyko F. Paro R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 824-832Google Scholar, 5Francis N.J. Kingston R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 409-421Google Scholar, 6Mahmoudi T. Verrijzer C.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3055-3066Google Scholar). Zeste is a transcriptional activator of homeotic genes, including Ultrabithorax (Ubx), as well as other genes such as white and decapentaplegic(dpp) (7Benson M. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1387-1392Google Scholar, 8Biggin M.D. Bickel S. Benson M. Pirrotta V. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 53: 713-722Google Scholar, 9Biggin M.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 53: 699-711Google Scholar, 10Laney J.D. Biggin M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1531-1541Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in the regulation of multiple genes, Zeste is found associated with over 60 sites on polytene chromosomes of the larval salivary gland (11Pirrotta V. Bickel S. Mariani C. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1839-1850Google Scholar, 12Rastelli L. Chan C.S. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1513-1522Google Scholar). Zeste recognition elements are found in the promoter areas of its target genes as well as in some polycomb response elements that mediate the maintenance of either gene activity or silencing by trxG and PcG proteins. So far, only three members of the trxG/PcG proteins have been shown to posses sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. In addition to Zeste, this group comprises GAGA, a zinc-finger trxG protein, and the PcG protein Pleiohomeotic, which contains a Krüppel-like zinc-finger DBD (5Francis N.J. Kingston R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 409-421Google Scholar, 6Mahmoudi T. Verrijzer C.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3055-3066Google Scholar, 13Brown J.L. Mucci D. Whiteley M. Dirksen M.L. Kassis J.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1057-1064Google Scholar). These factors are attractive candidate tethering factors that may direct non-DNA binding trxG/PcG proteins to polycomb response elements and promoters of homeotic genes. A combination of genetic and biochemical studies has suggested that Zeste activates gene expression by alleviation of chromatin-mediated repression. Zeste loss-of-function mutations are enhancers of position effect variegation, indicating a role in counteracting heterochromatin-mediated silencing (14Judd B.H. Genetics. 1995; 141: 245-253Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments revealed that Zeste recruits the SWI/SNF-related DrosophilaBrahma complex to mediate transcriptional activation on a chromatin template (15Kal A.J. Mahmoudi T. Zak N.B. Verrijzer C.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1058-1071Google Scholar). In addition, Zeste shows positive as well as negative genetic interactions with a number of PcG genes (16Phillips M.D. Shearn A. Genetics. 1990; 125: 91-101Google Scholar, 17Pelegri F. Lehmann R. Genetics. 1994; 136: 1341-1353Google Scholar). More recently, Zeste was identified as a component of a large Pc-containing complex, PRC1 (18Saurin A.J. Shao Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kingston R.E. Nature. 2001; 412: 655-660Google Scholar). Thus, Zeste may perform dual functions and act as a tethering factor for trxG activators as well as PcG repressors. Moreover, Zeste is involved in chromosome pairing-dependent gene control phenomena. Firstly, Zeste bound to an enhancer on one chromosome is able to activate an allelic promoter on a homologously paired chromosome. This process is referred to as transvection and has been described for loci such as Ubx, dpp, andyellow (19Lewis E.B. Am. Nat. 1954; 88: 225-239Google Scholar, 20Benson M. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3907-3915Google Scholar, 21Dorsett D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 505-514Google Scholar, 22Pirrotta V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: M1-M8Google Scholar). Secondly, particular neomorphic Zeste mutations result in pairing-dependent repression of transcription (23Rosen C. Dorsett D. Jack J. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1865-1874Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies show that Zeste is a multifunctional regulator of chromatin-directed gene regulation. A unique feature of Zeste is that it binds cooperatively to multiple Zeste elements as a higher-order homo-oligomer (24Chen J.D. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2075-2083Google Scholar, 25Chen J.D. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2061-2073Google Scholar). Zeste oligomerization is the result of coiled-coil interactions mediated by carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper motifs (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, a Zeste oligomer cannot bind efficiently to a single Zeste site; rather, DNA binding requires at least 4 or more recognition elements. Indeed, natural Zeste-responsive elements such as theUbx promoter (8Biggin M.D. Bickel S. Benson M. Pirrotta V. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 53: 713-722Google Scholar) or the Ubx polycomb response elements 2T. Mahmoudi and C. P. Verrijzer, submitted for publication.2T. Mahmoudi and C. P. Verrijzer, submitted for publication. typically contain multiple Zeste-binding elements. Although the Zeste-DBD (Fig. 2) was identified over a decade ago (24Chen J.D. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2075-2083Google Scholar, 26Chen J.D. Chan C.S. Pirrotta V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 598-608Google Scholar, 27Mansukhani A. Crickmore A. Sherwood P.W. Goldberg M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 615-623Google Scholar), no similarities with well characterized DNA-binding motifs have been identified so far. Many DNA-binding proteins can be classified into distinct groups that use a common structural motif for DNA recognition. The first DNA recognition motif discovered, and one of the best characterized, is the helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure (28Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Google Scholar). The HTH motif is part of the DBDs of a wide range of distinct gene regulatory proteins found in organisms ranging from bacteria and archaea to man. The second of the two helices that form the HTH motif inserts into the major groove of the DNA where it makes base-specific as well as backbone contacts. Consequently, this helix is referred to as the recognition helix. There is substantial variation in the DNA-binding protein structures harboring an HTH and in the way the recognition helix inserts into the major groove. One of the most common examples of an eukaryotic HTH DBD is the homeodomain. Within the ∼60-amino acid homeodomain, the HTH motif is part of a stable tri-helical protein fold with helix 2 and 3 forming the HTH motif. A unique feature of homeodomain-DNA interactions is that, in addition to the insertion of helix 3 into the major groove, DNA contacts are made by a short unstructured amino-terminal arm, which reaches into the minor groove (29Wolberger C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 62-68Google Scholar). A distinct class of tri-helical DBDs containing an HTH motif is formed by the Myb domain (30Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Science. 1991; 253: 1140-1143Google Scholar). As indicated by its name, Myb repeats were first recognized in the transcriptional regulator c-Myb, which is involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation (31Graf T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 249-255Google Scholar). The Myb DNA-binding domain comprises three imperfect tandem repeats (R1, R2, and R3), each forming a tri-helical protein fold in which an HTH motif is formed by helix 2 and 3 (32Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Google Scholar, 33Pinson B. Brendeford E.M. Gabrielsen O.S. Daignan-Fornier B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 527-535Google Scholar). Together, R2 and R3 are sufficient for recognition of specific DNA sequences, whereas R1 enhances the stability of the Myb-DNA complex (34Ebneth A. Schweers O. Thole H. Fagin U. Urbanke C. Maass G. Wolfes H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14586-14593Google Scholar, 35Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Hojo H. Yoshimura S. Zhang R. Aimoto S. Ametani Y. Hirata Z. Sarai A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 309-320Google Scholar). The three helices in each repeat are maintained by a hydrophobic core that includes three strictly conserved tryptophan residues (Fig.1) (36Saikumar P. Murali R. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8452-8456Google Scholar, 37Oda M. Furukawa K. Ogata K. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Nakamura H. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1407-1414Google Scholar). The turn between the second and third helices in each repeat is one amino acid longer than in the classical HTH motif. Another related domain is found in the yeast regulator Rap1p (repressor activator protein 1), which contains a DBD with properties that are somewhat in between those of a homeodomain and a Myb domain. Rap1p is a bifunctional regulator, which can either activate or repress transcription; its binding sites are found in the promoters of a large number of genes as well as at telomeric DNA (38Shore D. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 408-412Google Scholar). The Rap1p DBD contains two very similar subdomains that each bind the sequence GGTGT arranged in a tandem orientation. The structure of each of these is very similar to that of the Myb domain, but, like homeodomains, the Rap1p subdomains contain an amino-terminal arm that contacts the minor groove (39Konig P. Giraldo R. Chapman L. Rhodes D. Cell. 1996; 85: 125-136Google Scholar). Another protein sequence motif that shows similarity to the Myb domain is the SANT domain, which was first recognized in several proteins involved in transcriptional control including SWI3, ADA2, N-CoR, andTFIIIB (40Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Gibson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 87-88Google Scholar). Although no DNA-binding activity has been reported for the SANT domain, it has been suggested, based on sequence similarities, that the Myb and SANT domains are folded into a related conformation. Finally, the DBD of the vertebrate telomere repeat-binding factor TRF1 comprises a single Myb domain that suffices for sequence-specific DNA binding (41Konig P. Fairall L. Rhodes D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1731-1740Google Scholar). Helix 3 of the TRF1 DBD makes base-specific contacts in the major groove, whereas its amino-terminal arm binds within the minor groove (42Nishikawa T. Okamura H. Nagadoi A. Konig P. Rhodes D. Nishimura Y. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1237-1251Google Scholar). Hence, the Myb domain and homeodomain are related tri-helical structural arrangements harboring an HTH motif that binds DNA in a related but distinct fashion. In this study, we have analyzed the structural and functional properties of the Zeste-DBD. Although previous studies failed to uncover a relationship between the Zeste-DBD and known DNA recognizing structures, our results indicate that the Zeste-DBD is related both to the Myb- and to the homeodomain. We found that a 76-amino acid domain of Zeste, corresponding to a single Myb repeat, mediates sequence-specific DNA binding. Interestingly, the Zeste-DBD is significantly larger than the 60-amino acid homeodomain or the ∼50-amino acid Myb domain. However, the strict conservation of key structural residues and structure predictions suggested that the Zeste-DBD might form an extended tri-helical DBD related to the Myb domain and the homeodomain. Using a combination of band shift assays, DNase I, and hydroxyl radical footprinting, we characterized the DNA-binding properties of the Zeste-DBD. The optimal Zeste recognition sequence was identified, and functional assays revealed that changes in DNA-protein interactions affect transcriptional activation by Zeste. In addition to base-specific contacts, sequence-independent backbone contacts were shown to be critical for efficient Zeste binding. Interestingly, hydroxyl radical footprinting revealed that the Zeste-DNA backbone contacts covering about 13 base pairs all map to one face of the DNA. Our results indicated that the Zeste-DBD is related to the Myb domain but that there are significant differences in the way these domains interact with DNA. To investigate whether the DBD of Zeste based on the homology to Myb/SANT domains (between amino acid 42 and 143) were still able to bind DNA, six different expression constructs were created (indicated in Fig.2 A). DNA fragments encoding the different DBDs were generated using a PCR-based strategy. Primers were designed to generate a BamHI restriction site directly in front of the indicated amino-terminal Zeste amino acid and a stopcodon and EcoRI site following the indicated carboxyl-terminal residue (sequence details are available upon request). The digested DNA fragments were cloned into aBamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-4T-1 (AmershamBiosciences) expression vector, which allowed expression of GST- Zeste fusion proteins with an intervening thrombin cleavage site. These proteins were expressed in Escherichia coliBL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). An overnight culture grown at 30 °C was diluted 50-fold in fresh LB-media and grown at 37 °C for 90 min. The temperature was shifted to 30 °C for 30 min, and atA 600 = 0.55, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the protein was expressed at 30 °C for another 3 h. Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −80 °C. All protein procedures were carried out at 4 °C using HEMG buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol) and varying amounts of NaCl. To isolate the recombinant protein the lysis was carried out in HEMG buffer also containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm AEBSF ((2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride), 1 μm pepstatin, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 0.5 mm sodium metabisulphite, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. After incubation for 45 min, a freeze-thaw step was performed, and the cells were sonicated several times. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in a SS-34 rotor for 25 min, the tagged proteins were affinity-purified from the supernatant on glutathione-Sepharose 4B. After extensive washes, the recombinant proteins were eluted by thrombin cleavage at room temperature for 45 min. The elution was done in HEMG buffer containing 150 mmNaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol, giving two extra amino acids (glycine-serine) at the amino terminus of the recombinant proteins. The protein concentrations of the preparations were determined by UV-measurements (all around 0.4 mm) and verified by Coomassie staining. The fractions were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Analyses of the affinity-purified DBD proteins by denaturing SDS-PAGE showed a single band with the expected molecular mass, ranging from ∼7 to 17 kDa (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). For band shift assays, double-stranded oligonucleotides (Figs. 3 and 5) were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA-binding reactions were performed in 25 μl of binding buffer (0.5× HEMG, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of 50 ng poly(dIdC)-poly(dIdC), ∼150 fmol of labeled probe, and 1.15, 0.58, or 0.29 μm protein. All binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 25 min and were analyzed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, run in 0.5× Tris-glycine/0.1% Nonidet P-40 buffer at room temperature. For kinetic analysis, a titration of 0.0045 μm to 4.6 μm protein by 2-fold increments was done in the absence of poly(dIdC)- poly(dIdC) (Fig.4). For footprinting studies, a 51-base pairs double-stranded oligonucleotide harboring a single Zeste site was used. It is based on the Ubx promoter, and has the following sequence for the top strand: GCCGCTGATAATGTCCTAAAAACGAGTGGAAAACAGGCGCGCGCCTGTTAT (the Zeste recognition site and flanking sequences are indicated in bold). Either the top or the bottom strand was labeled using the T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNase I footprinting reactions were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 100 ng of poly(dIdC)-poly(dIdC). After binding at room temperature for 25 min, 2 μl of 100 mm CaCl2 and 2 units DNase I were added. Digestion was allowed at room temperature for 1 min and terminated by addition of 100 μl 20 mm EDTA, 0.2m NaCl, 1% SDS, and 0.25 mg/ml glycogen, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The samples were analyzed on a 15% sequencing gel. Hydroxyl radical footprinting reactions were carried out in 50 μl of binding buffer containing 1.6% glycerol and in the absence of poly(dIdC)-poly(dIdC). After binding, 9 μl of a freshly prepared mixture of 0.13 mmEDTA, 0.07 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate, 2% H2O2, and 67 mm sodium ascorbate was added. The cleavage reactions were stopped by addition of 30 μl of 0.2 m thiourea. Next, 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA and 2 μm EDTA were added. The samples were processed as described above. Most experiments were repeated several times and quantified using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager.Figure 5Identification of the Zeste consensus recognition sequence. A, to determine the critical sequence-determinants for Zeste-DNA recognition, we systematically mutated various bases within the core recognition sequence as well as positions flanking the consensus. We used the double-stranded oligonucleotide 17L and various 17L-derived mutants in a band shift assay in the presence of decreasing amounts of Zeste-DBD. A selection of representative autoradiographs are shown. The mutants were grouped into either wild-type (++) affinity, less than 2-fold reduced (+), over 4-fold reduced (±), and more than 10-fold (−) reduced affinity. These results suggest (T/C/g)GAGTG(A/G/c) as the Zeste consensus recognition sequence (shown at the bottom of the table). The lines flanking the consensus sequence indicate sequence-independent bases, critical for DNA binding by the Zeste-DBD. B, effects of distinct Zeste site mutations on transcription. In vitro transcription assays were used to compare the level of Zeste-dependent transcription on a template harboring 4 consensus Zeste elements (wild-type, mut 11 and 23) or templates containing suboptimal Zeste sites (mut 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, and 24). The mutations present in the various templates (indicated above the lanes) are shown in Fig. 5 A. Transcription reactions were performed either in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of purified full-length Zeste. Transcription products were detected by primer extension, separated on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to autoradiography. The gels were quantified by phosphorimager analysis, which revealed an approximately 20-fold activation of transcription by Zeste on the templates with optimal binding sites, whereas the level of activation on the mutant templates was between 5–10-fold reduced.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Determination of theK d of Zeste-DBD. The double-stranded oligonucleotide 17L (see Fig. 3) was incubated with increasing amounts of Zeste-DBD. Next, the DNA occupancy was determined in a mobility shift assay. The percentage of bound DNA was determined by quantitation of the gel using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and plotted against the DBD concentration (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under conditions when the total DNA concentration is well below theK d, the K d approximates the protein concentration at which 50% of the DNA is bound. The concentration of 17L in these reactions was about 6 nm, which allowed us to estimate a K d of ∼1.3 × 10−7m, the protein concentration at which 50% of the DNA is bound.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Transcription reactions and primer extension analysis were carried out essentially as described by Kadonaga (43Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2624-2631Google Scholar). The template was plasmid 4ZpblueTATA, which contained either 4 optimized Zeste-binding sites (GATCCCGAGTGGTTCGTATGTCGAGTGGCTAACCCTTCCACTCGATCCATGGTCGAGTGGGAATTCCG) or 4 mutant Zeste sites containing the indicated mutation (Fig.5) upstream of a consensus TATA box and initiator element. Briefly, transcription reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl and contained 40 ng of template DNA (in the form of naked DNA), 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 70 mm KCl, 0.6 mm ATP, 1% polyvinyl alcohol (molecular mass of 10,000), 0.1 μl of RNase inhibitor, and 0.8 mm DDT. The basal transcription machinery was provided by addition of 0.2 μl of the Heparin H0.4 fraction partially purified from 0–12 h Drosophila embryo nuclear extracts (15Kal A.J. Mahmoudi T. Zak N.B. Verrijzer C.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1058-1071Google Scholar). Upon addition of Zeste, reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to the start of transcription by addition of 0.6 mm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP. After 30 min at 30 °C transcription was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of stop buffer (20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml yeast RNA, and 50 μg/ml Proteinase K). The RNA transcripts were visualized by primer extension using a radiolabeled primer (PV313) (15Kal A.J. Mahmoudi T. Zak N.B. Verrijzer C.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1058-1071Google Scholar) and analyzed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Transcription gels were quantified using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Like most transcription factors, Zeste has a modular organization, and distinct structural and functional domains can be recognized (Fig.2 A). Among its prominent features are an amino-terminal DBD and a carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper oligomerization domain. The leucine zipper domain mediates coiled-coil interactions that lead to the formation of higher-order Zeste multimers (26Chen J.D. Chan C.S. Pirrotta V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 598-608Google Scholar). As a result, Zeste binds DNA cooperatively as an oligomer, and a typical natural response element for Zeste contains 4 or more Zeste-binding sites (24Chen J.D. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2075-2083Google Scholar). Although the DBD of Zeste was identified and narrowed down to amino acids 47–138 well over a decade ago (27Mansukhani A. Crickmore A. Sherwood P.W. Goldberg M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 615-623Google Scholar), its relationship with other DBDs remained unresolved. In an attempt to identify potential structural motifs in Zeste, we first identified protein sequences that are highly conserved between Zeste from two distinct fly species, Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster, and used these regions to search protein databases. A BLAST search of the SWISS-PROT data base revealed a clear relationship between Zeste and the Myb-DBD as well as with the Myb-related SANT domain. Fig. 1 illustrates the primary sequence similarity between the Zeste-DBD and the Myb-DBD obtained following a clustal W alignment and further optimization by manual editing. In addition to an overall sequence similarity, there is strict conservation of critical hydrophobic residues that are involved in the formation of the hydrophobic core of the Myb-DBD. Furthermore, the conserved glycines and prolines at the end of helices 2 and 3 in the Zeste-DBD are conserved, whereas the glycine/proline after helix 1 is not conserved in Zeste. Moreover, a structure prediction using the PredictProtein program (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) suggested that the Zeste-DBD may also have a tri-helical structure. Taken together, these observations are consistent with the idea that the Zeste-DBD may form a protein fold similar to that found in the Myb domain. However, all three putative α helices within the Zeste-DBD are extended relative to those present in the Myb domain. Compared with the Myb domain, the putative helices 1, 2, and 3 are respectively 12, 4, and 10 residues longer. It should be noted that helix 1 is extended in the area where the conserved glycine is lacking. Although this hypothesis awaits a three-dimensional structure determination, these findings suggest that the Zeste-DBD forms an extended Myb-like domain. To determine whether the Myb-related domain in Zeste was sufficient to mediate sequence-specific DNA binding, we expressed the series of polypeptides indicated in Fig. 2 A. The various constructs were expressed as GST-fusion proteins in E. coli, and following purification on a Gluthathione-Sepharose matrix the Zeste polypeptides were released from the GST portion by thrombin cleavage. These polypeptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining, revealing comparable concentrations and purity (Fig. 2 B, top panel). Next, we compared the ability of the distinct Zeste-DBD polypeptides to recognize and bind a 22 base pair DNA oligomer harboring a single Zeste-binding site derived from the Drosophila Ubx promoter (9Biggin M.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 53: 699-711Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 B (bottom panel), all Zeste polypeptides tested efficiently bound the Zeste site. Thus, the minimal 76-residue Zeste polypeptide Z (51–126) that is homologous to a single Myb repeat is sufficient for DNA binding. Hope-Struhl bandshift assays demonstrated that the Zeste-DBD binds DNA as a monomer (our data not shown) (24Chen J.D. Pirrotta V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2075-2083Google Scholar). In the DNA-binding experiments described below we used this polypeptide and refer to it as DBD. To determine the outer borders of the DNA sequence required for Zeste-DBD binding, we generated a series of oligonucleotides that were progressively shortened toward a Zeste site derived from the Ubx promoter (core sequence:CGAGTG, Fig. 3). We chose an oligonucleotide of 22 base pairs as our longest DNA fragment because it encompassed the Zeste DNase I footprinting borders (data not shown, see also Fig.6). For reference we numbered the top strand bases from 1 to 22, as indicated in Fig. 3. A series of double-stranded oligonucleotides, which were either 22 base pairs or shortened upstream (left, L) or downstream of the Zeste site (right, R), were labeled and tested for"

In this study, we determined the mRNA levels for myelin basic protein (MBP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in different CNS areas of rats made Cbl-deficient by total gastrectomy, as well as the mRNA levels for glycoprotein Po and peripheral myelin protein (PMP)22 in the sciatic nerve. GFAP-mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the spinal cord (SC) and hypothalamus, but not in the cortex, hippocampus, or striatum of totally gastrectomized (TGX) rats. No differences in GFAP protein levels were found in the SC and hypothalamus of the TGX rats treated or not with Cbl. MBP-mRNA levels were significantly decreased only in the hypothalamus, and the levels of mRNA for both glial markers returned to normal with Cbl replacement therapy. The levels of mRNA for the various myelin proteins in the sciatic nerve were not modified by Cbl deficiency. These results demonstrate that: a) the neurotrophic action of Cbl in rat CNS occurs in a zonal manner; and b) Cbl deficiency does not affect myelin synthesis (with the sole exception of the hypothalamus)."
