In this study, we have analyzed the mechanism of endostatin action on endothelial cells and nonendothelial cells. Endostatin treatment of cow pulmonary artery endothelial cells caused apoptosis, as demonstrated by three methods, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining, caspase 3, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling assay. Moreover, addition of endostatin led to a marked reduction of the Bcl-2 and Bcl-XLanti-apoptotic protein, whereas Bax protein levels were unaffected. These effects were not seen in several nonendothelial cells. Collectively, these findings provide important mechanistic insight into endostatin action.

Advantages of anti-angiogenic therapy include ease of access of drugs to the endothelial cell compartment, targeting of a genetically stable cell population (endothelial versustumor cells) thereby lessening the chance of drug resistance and “amplification” achieved, because one endothelial cell supports the growth of 50–100 tumor cells (2O'Reilly M.S.

Endostatin, a 20-kDa C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII, is a specific inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation (8O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E.

Endostatin regresses established syngeneic Lewis lung carcinomas, T241 fibrosarcoma, and B16 melanoma tumors in xenograft models (8O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S.

Recently, tumor dormancy was induced following repeated cycles of endostatin treatment (10Boehm T. Folkman J. Browder T. O'Reilly M.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). Administration of recombinant mouse endostatin to tumor-bearing animals increases the apoptotic index of the tumor cells without affecting their proliferation index (8O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y.

Cell. 1997; 88: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4253) Google Scholar), but no data on endothelial cells has been described. The mechanism of endostatin action is unknown. In vitroresults from this laboratory and others (8O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar) show that endostatin inhibits the proliferation of endothelial cells but has no effect on tumor cells or nonendothelial cell types, including fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Thus, the action of endostatin seems to be endothelial cell specific. Because the presence of endostatin in endothelial cell culture affects proliferation (and migration), we asked whether the endothelial cells are undergoing programmed cell death. Our studies show that soluble yeast-derived mouse endostatin altered the morphology of endothelial cells leading to the characteristic features of cells undergoing apoptosis. Endostatin-treated cells shifted in annexin V-FITC1-labeling by FACS, and after roughly 12 h, externalization of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface ensued. In addition, endostatin treatment increased the activity of the intracellular protease caspase 3, resulting in DNA degradation in the nucleus, as independently confirmed via the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling) (TUNEL) assay. Western blot analysis showed reduction of the Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL anti-apoptotic proteins without any effect on the level of the Bax pro-apoptotic protein. In nonendothelial cells,viz., NIH3T3 and A10 smooth muscle cells, endostatin did not show any effects in any of the above assays, indicating specificity of endostatin toward endothelial cells. The mouse endostatin protein was produced and purified from yeast, as described elsewhere (9Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Volk R. Stillman I.E. Lombardo M. Arispe L. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar). Some batches contained DNA, which had no effect on apoptosis. Anti-Fade reagent was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α was obtained from R & D Systems, Inc. 16% methanol-free formaldehyde, used for the fixing solutions, was purchased from Polysciences, Inc. The annexin V-FITC-labeling kit was purchased fromCLONTECH. Cow pulmonary artery endothelial (C-PAE) cells, obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The cells were incubated in a humidified environment at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Bovine aortic endothelial cells, a gift from C. Ferran, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Bovine adrenal cortex capillary endothelial cells were a gift from Dr. J. Folkman, Children's Hospital, Boston. HUVE and HMVE-L cells were obtained from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA). IMR-90, lung fibroblast, NIH3T3 fibroblast, A10 smooth muscle cell, H9c2 (2-1)-myoblast cell line, and 786–0 renal clear cell carcinoma cells were all purchased from ATCC. Annexin V, a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein with a high affinity for phosphatidylserine (PS) was used to detect early stage apoptosis (11van Engeland M. Nieland L.J. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200,000 cells were plated onto a fibronectin-coated 6-well plate in DMEM containing 2% FCS and 3 ng/ml bFGF. Different concentrations of recombinant mouse endostatin were added to each well, and cells were harvested and processed 18 h after treatment. For the time course study, 10 μg/ml endostatin was added and cells were processed after 3, 4, 6, 12, and 18 h. Human recombinant TNF-α (40 ng/ml) was used as a positive control. The cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). Annexin V-FITC was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, and the cells were incubated in the dark for 10 min, then washed again in PBS and resuspended in 300 μl of binding buffer. 10 μl of propidium iodide (PI) was added to each sample before flow cytometric analysis. The cells were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACStar plus flow cytometer. Electronic compensation was used to eliminate bleed-through fluorescence. In each sample, a minimum of 10,000 cells was counted and stored in listmode. Data analysis was performed with standard Cell Quest software (Becton-Dickinson). The quadrant settings were set so that the negative control allowed less than 1% positivity. Endostatin was added to nonendothelial cells (NIH3T3 and 786–0) at 10 μg/ml, and the cells were processed and analyzed as described above. This assay was performed in a 75-cm2 tissue culture flask or on fibronectin-coated 6-well plates. For the 6-well plates, 0.5–1 × 106 cells (75-cm2 flask, 2 × 106 cells) were seeded and maintained overnight in DMEM with 10% FCS. The following day, the old medium was replaced with fresh medium (2% FCS), and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Following starvation, the cells were stimulated with bFGF (3 ng/ml) in DMEM (2% FCS). Along with bFGF, yeast endostatin (10 μg/ml, final concentration) was added, and the cells were grown for 24 h. For the control plate, only the PBS buffer was added. As a positive control, TNF-α was used at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. After 24 h, the supernatant cells were centrifuged and collected. The wells (flasks) were trypsinized to collect the attached cells and combined with the supernatant cells. The cells were counted and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (CLONTECH) at a concentration of 4 × 107 cells/ml. The rest of the protocol followed the manufacturer's instruction (CLONTECH). A specific inhibitor of caspase 3, DEVD-fmk, was used to confirm the specificity as suggested by the manufacturer. The absorbance was measured in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at 405 nm. Fold-increase in protease activity (caspase 3) was determined by comparing the results of the induced sample (yeast endostatin or TNF-α) with the uninduced control. Similarly nonendothelial cells (NIH3T3 and H9c2 (2-1)-myoblast) were used and analyzed as described above. C-PAE cells were seeded at a density of 5,000 cells/well on fibronectin-coated (10 μg/ml) Lab-Tek chamber slides and grown in 0.4 ml of DMEM with 10% FCS. After 2 days, the old medium was aspirated and fresh DMEM with 2% FCS was added, and the cells were starved overnight. The following day, 0.36 ml of new medium (with 2% FCS) containing 3 ng/ml bFGF was added along with yeast endostatin (10 μg/ml) or TNF-α (20 ng/ml). For control samples, fresh medium (2% FCS) containing bFGF (3 ng/ml) was added. Following induction (24 h), the slides were washed twice with PBS, and subsequently fixed in fresh 4% formaldehyde/PBS at 4 °C for 25 min. The slides were washed in PBS and the cells permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min on ice, then washed with fresh PBS twice for 5 min each at room temperature, and the TUNEL assay was performed as described below. The TUNEL assay was performed as described in the ApoAlert DNA fragmentation assay kit user manual (CLONTECH), except that the final concentration of propidium iodide (Sigma) used was 1 μg/ml. After the assay, a drop of anti-fade solution was added, and the treated portion of the slide was covered with a glass coverslip with the edges sealed with clear nail polish. Slides were viewed immediately under a fluorescent microscope using a dual filter set for green (520 nm) and red fluorescence (>620 nm). The images were captured using a digital microscope (Nikon Microphot-SA) and processed using SPOT software version 1.1.02. For all samples except the positive control (TNF-α: 5 fields), 15 random fields were chosen, and the number of green and red cells per field were counted. Floating cells were collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The old medium was aspirated, and the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS (pH 7.4). Cells were centrifuged again, the PBS removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 75 μl of fresh PBS. Resuspended cells were spread on a poly-l-lysine-coated slide (Labscientific, Inc.) using a clean slide. The cells were fixed by immersing the slides in fresh 4% formaldehyde/PBS at 4 °C for 25 min. The rest of the protocol was carried out as explained above. C-PAE cells (1 × 106) were seeded in 10-cm Petri dishes precoated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) in the presence of 2% FCS containing 3 ng/ml bFGF. Endostatin was added at 10 μg/ml, and cells were harvested at 12, 24, and 28 h after treatment. Cells were washed three times in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 1× EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing freshly added complete protease inhibitor tablet (Boehringer Mannheim), 100 μg/ml Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The protein concentration in whole cell lysate was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method. 30 μg of whole cell extract was loaded onto a 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Transfer was performed using a semi-dry transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in wash buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline) with 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Goat antibody directed against human Bcl-2 (N-19) {sc-492-G} was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Affinity purified mouse polyclonal antibody against Bax (B-9) {sc7490} and Bcl-XS/L {sc1690} were purchased from the same manufacturer. Polyclonal anti-actin antibody (Sigma) was used to normalize for protein loading. Secondary antibodies were anti-goat, mouse and rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoreactivity was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Images were scanned using a flat bed scanner (Scan-Jet 4C) and quantitated by the NIH image 1.61 software. Normalization was done by dividing the Bcl-2 signal by that of actin within each experiment. When proliferating, C-PAE cells were treated with mouse endostatin at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, the cells rounded (Fig.1 A) and detached from the fibronectin-coated plate. In the controls, the cells showed intact endothelial cell morphology, whereas endostatin-treated cells appeared rounded and showed membrane blebbing characteristic of apoptotic cells. We have also observed similar effects with endostatin-treated bovine adrenal cortex capillary endothelial and bovine aorta endothelial cells (data not shown), but C-PAE cells showed the most dramatic effect. Interestingly, these effects of endostatin were most pronounced when bFGF was added to subconfluent monolayers (2 × 104/well in a 24-well plate and 0.1 × 106/well in a 6-well plate) when cells were in exponential growth. This, perhaps, mimics the in vivo situation,i.e. endostatin appears to be selective for tumor vasculature where there is endothelial cell division. Importantly, endostatin at 10 μg/ml on nonendothelial cells, viz. A10 and H9c2 (2-1)-myoblast, did not show any effect as was seen in endothelial cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Moreover, because cells plated efficiently on fibronectin-coated plates even in the presence of endostatin, endostatin's effect was not simply via altering cell-matrix interactions. Next, we checked for other hallmarks of apoptosis, phosphatidylserine externalization, intracellular protease activation, and nuclear condensation with DNA fragmentation. After initiation of apoptosis, most cell types translocate the membrane phospholipid PS from the inner surface of the plasma membrane to the outside (11van Engeland M. Nieland L.J. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar, 12Zhang G. Gurtu V. Kain S.R. Yan G. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 13Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P. Kuijten G.A. Keehnen R.M. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PS can be detected by staining with an FITC conjugate of annexin V, 38-kDa protein that binds naturally to PS. During programmed cell death, PS externalization typically precedes membrane bleb formation and DNA fragmentation (12Zhang G. Gurtu V. Kain S.R. Yan G. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows annexin V-FITC staining in conjunction with PI staining in C-PAE cells treated for 18 h with different concentrations of endostatin. Endostatin at 10 μg/ml showed a distinct shift in annexin fluorescence intensity. The mean fluorescence intensity difference between control and endostatin-treated cell was significant (p = 0.01) at 5 and 10 μg/ml. The shift in fluorescence intensity was similar for endostatin at 10 μg/ml and the positive control TNF-α (40 ng/ml). Concentrations of endostatin below 0.1 μg/ml did not show any significant annexin V positivity (data not shown). To investigate the earliest time point at which endostatin caused externalization of PS, we conducted a time course experiment (Fig. 2 B). The effect of endostatin was significant (p = 0.01) at 12 h after treatment. Time points before 6 h did not show a difference between control and treated samples. Morphological examination of FACS-analyzed samples with fluorescence microscopy (Nikon) showed annexin V staining localized to the cell membrane at 12 h with no staining in the cytoplasm (data not shown). During this period, the majority of the cells were negative for PI, implicating the early stage of apoptosis. With increased exposure time (24–36 h), in addition to membrane staining with annexin V some of the cells turned positive for PI (data not shown) (12Zhang G. Gurtu V. Kain S.R. Yan G. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 14Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar), consistent with a more advanced stage of apoptosis. Similar levels of annexin V staining were observed in two other endothelial cell lines studied, namely, bovine aorta endothelial and bovine adrenal cortex capillary endothelial (data not shown). We have also tested the effect of human endostatin on these three bovine endothelial cell lines. We failed to detect annexin V staining in the presence of human endostatin added to these cells, whereas when human endothelial cell lines were used (HUVE and HMVE-L), it resulted in a marked shift in annexin V fluorescence. 2M. Dhanabal, R. Volk, R. Ramchandran, M. Simons, and V. P. Sukhatme, manuscript in preparation. These data indicate that apoptosis, as assessed by annexin V staining, occurs in diverse endothelial cells in response to mouse and human endostatin. With regard to nonendothelial cells, 786–0 and NIH3T3 cells, we failed to see any distinct annexin positivity (Fig. 2, C andD). In addition, we screened other nonendothelial cells (IMR-90, A10, and H9c2 (2-1)-myoblast) and found no effect of endostatin (data not shown). Based on these results, endostatin's action appears to be selective for endothelial cells. Caspase 3 (CPP32) is an intracellular protease activated early during apoptosis of mammalian cells and initiates cellular breakdown by degrading specific structural, regulatory, and DNA repair proteins (12Zhang G. Gurtu V. Kain S.R. Yan G. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar,14Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar, 15Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar, 16Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This protease activity can be measured spectrophotometrically by detection of the chromophore (p-nitroanilide) after cleavage from the labeled substrate (DEVD-pNA). First, we performed a time course experiment with 10 μg/ml of endostatin and checked for increase in caspase 3 activity. There was no difference in caspase 3 activity between the treated and the control samples at 2, 4, 8, and 14 h (data not shown). However, caspase 3 activity was elevated 24 h after treatment with endostatin over controls. The caspase activity of the endostatin and TNF-α (positive control) treated samples is shown in Fig. 3 A. When compared with controls, endostatin-treated cells showed a 1.8-fold increase in caspase 3 activity after 24 h, whereas TNF-α gave a comparable (1.75-fold) increase. When a specific inhibitor of caspase 3 (DEVD-fmk) was included in the same samples, the protease activity was at baseline (comparison of the dark box with the corresponding white box), indicating that the increase in the measured activity was specific for caspase 3. For NIH3T3 cells only, a marginal increase in caspase 3 was seen, whereas in myoblast cells there was no difference in caspase 3 levels between treated and control cultures (Fig.3 B). Fragmentation of nuclear DNA is one of the distinct morphological changes occurring in the nucleus of an apoptotic cell. A TUNEL assay was performed on endostatin-treated, TNF-α-treated, and control cells. Fig. 4 A shows the immunofluorescent pictures of adherent cells on slides. In the presence of the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, both endostatin- and TNF-α-treated slides showed numerous positive cells under green fluorescence (panels f and h), whereas no positive cells were seen in the control (panel b). Without the enzyme, the endostatin-treated slide showed background cell fluorescence (panel d). Panels a,c, e, and g represent the same field of cells stained with propidium iodide. We counted the number of apoptotic cells in several fields, and the percent of apoptotic cells (green divided by the number of red cells per field) is plotted in Fig. 4 B. The apoptosis rate in the control cells was 1.24%. In the endostatin-treated cells, a 30-fold increase in the apoptosis rate was observed in suspension cells (38.3%), whereas a 15-fold increase was observed in the attached cells (19.4%). With TNF-α, the apoptosis rate was 6.4%. In contrast, the percent of TUNEL-positive in the angiostatin-treated bovine adrenal cortex capillary endothelial cells was 2% when compared with the control cells (1.2%), a 1.6-fold increase (17Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Ito N. Anand-Apte B. Soker S. Zetter B. O'Reilly M. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5579-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), suggesting that endostatin is a stronger apoptotic agent than angiostatin. Anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL prevent programmed cell death in response to numerous stimuli (18Cho J.H. Kim W.H. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1998; 194: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Allen R.T. Cluck M.W. Agrawal D.K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 427-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Conversely, pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bak can accelerate cell death, and in certain cases, they are sufficient to cause apoptosis independent of additional signals (19Allen R.T. Cluck M.W. Agrawal D.K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 427-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We tested whole cell extract of endostatin-treated and control C-PAE cells for Bcl-2 and Bax expression levels. In growth arrested C-PAE cells, Bcl-2 expression was high. It was relatively constant up to 28 h; in contrast, endostatin-treated cells showed a marked decrease in Bcl-2 (Fig. 5 A). Densitometry revealed that the levels of Bcl-2 compared with control was 1.2-, 1.5-, and 3-fold less at 12, 24, and 28 h, respectively, after treatment, with actin levels used as normalization controls. In contrast, Bax expression was similar between control and treated cultures (Fig. 5 B). Bcl-2 protein was not detected in NIH3T3 and IMR-90 cells. Bax expression levels were not affected by endostatin treatment in these cell lines (Fig. 6, A andB). In C-PAE cells, at the early time point (12 h), Bcl-XL level was reduced by 2-fold, whereas its expression was unchanged in NIH3T3 cell (Fig. 6, C and D). Interestingly, we have detected only the larger pro-apoptotic form of Bcl-X in C-PAE, whereas both smaller and larger forms were detected in NIH3T3. These findings suggest that endostatin exerts its regulatory activity by altering Bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, vascular endothelial growth factor has been shown to augment Bcl-2 levels in endothelial cells (20Gerber H.P. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13313-13316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Because endostatin antagonizes VEGF's proliferative effects (data not shown), Bcl-2 appears to be one of potentially many down-regulated proteins. Recent studies indicate that the Bcl-2 protein binds to other proteins, such as Bax, Bcl XS, Bik, and Bad, which ultimately enhance cell survival (21Newton K. Strasser A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Jacobson M.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 277-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of another Bcl-2 homologue, Bax, remains enigmatic (23Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL function through heterodimerization with Bax (24Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar,25Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N.

Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that FGF-2 inhibited endothelial cell apoptosis by Bcl-2-dependent and -independent mechanisms (26Knudson C.M. Tung K.S. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). In our study, we did see differences in Bcl-2 (and Bcl-XL) expression in endostatin-treated cultures but no difference in Bax levels. It is possible that Bcl-2 may act independently of Bax, as has been shown for T cells (26Knudson C.M. Tung K.S. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J.

Studies are in progress to delineate the importance of other anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins and their phosphorylation status in response to endostatin treatment. In summary, we have demonstrated that endostatin causes apoptosis of endothelial cells in vitro, but not nonendothelial cells. This finding sheds the first mechanistic insight into the action of endostatin. The intracellular events that trigger the apoptotic response are under current investigation. We thank Dr. A.

https://openalex.org/W2131355261,"Regulation of translation of mRNAs coding for specific proteins plays an important role in controlling cell growth, differentiation, and transformation. Two proteins have been implicated in the regulation of specific mRNA translation: eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E and ribosomal protein S6. Increased phosphorylation of eIF4E as well as its overexpression are associated with stimulation of translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5′-untranslated regions. Similarly, phosphorylation of S6 results in preferential translation of mRNAs containing an oligopyrimidine tract at the 5′-end of the message. In the present study, leucine stimulated phosphorylation of the eIF4E-binding protein, 4E-BP1, in L6 myoblasts, resulting in dissociation of eIF4E from the inactive eIF4E·4E-BP1 complex. The increased availability of eIF4E was associated with a 1.6-fold elevation in ornithine decarboxylase relative to global protein synthesis. Leucine also stimulated phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase, p70S6k, resulting in increased phosphorylation of S6. Hyperphosphorylation of S6 was associated with a 4-fold increase in synthesis of elongation factor eEF1A. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the protein kinase mTOR, prevented all of the leucine-induced effects. Thus, leucine acting through an mTOR-dependent pathway stimulates the translation of specific mRNAs both by increasing the availability of eIF4E and by stimulating phosphorylation of S6.

Acta. 1972; 259: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Regulation of translation initiation is known to occur through modulation of two of the numerous steps in the pathway. The first regulated step is the binding of methionyl-tRNAi(Met-tRNAi) to the 40 S ribosomal subunit to form the 43 S preinitiation complex (reviewed in Refs. 4Kleijn M. Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 5Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). This step is mediated by eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF2, and involves formation of an eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi ternary complex followed by binding of the ternary complex to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. The overall process of Met-tRNAi binding is regulated through changes in the activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eIF2, termed eIF2B, and appears to involve changes in phosphorylation of either the α-subunit of eIF2 and/or the ε-subunit of eIF2B. The second regulated step in translation initiation is the binding of mRNA to the 43 S preinitiation complex (reviewed in Refs. 4Kleijn M. Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and 5Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). This step is mediated by a group of proteins collectively referred to as eIF4. During this step, eIF4E binds to the m7GTP cap structure present at the 5′-end of essentially all eukaryotic mRNAs and, through association with eIF4G, also binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. The mRNA binding step is regulated through changes in phosphorylation of eIF4E, with phosphorylation increasing the affinity of eIF4E for the cap structure (6Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) as well as by changes in the availability of eIF4E to form the active eIF4E·eIF4G complex. Changes in eIF4E availability occur through modulation of the association of eIF4E with the translational repressor, 4E-BP1. eIF4E associated with 4E-BP1 cannot bind to eIF4G and therefore does not bind to the 43 S preinitiation complex. The binding of eIF4E to 4E-BP1 is regulated through phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. A variety of hormones stimulate 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and result in dissociation of the eIF4E·4E-BP1 complex (reviewed in Ref. 7Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that leucine availability in L6 myoblasts caused alterations in both the Met-tRNAi and mRNA binding steps (8Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In particular, leucine caused a stimulation of eIF2B activity, an impairment of eIF4E binding to 4E-BP1 and an enhancement of eIF4E binding to eIF4G. However, the changes in eIF4E availability could be dissociated from both the changes in eIF2B activity and the changes in global protein synthesis caused by leucine. Thus, global protein synthesis was regulated by alterations in eIF2B activity and were independent of changes in eIF4E availability. The question remained as to the potential functional role of changes in eIF4E availability caused by leucine. Studies by others have suggested that changes involving eIF4E may be important in regulating the translation of mRNAs encoding specific proteins or families of proteins (reviewed in Ref. 4Kleijn M. Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). eIF4E has been implicated in the regulation of translation of mRNAs containing highly structured 5′-untranslated regions, such as that coding for ornithine decarboxylase (ODC).1 In addition, translation of specific mRNAs is regulated through changes in phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (reviewed in Ref.9Jefferies H.B.J. Thomas G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. 30. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 389-409Google Scholar). S6 phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating the synthesis of proteins, such as elongation factors eEF1A and eEF2, which are encoded by mRNAs containing oligopyrimidine tracts at the 5′-end of the message (TOPS mRNAs). In our previous study (8Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we found that leucine not only modulated eIF4E availability, but also altered the phosphorylation state of the 70-kDa S6 protein kinase (p70S6k). Thus, leucine may regulate the translation of specific mRNAs through changes in eIF4E availability and S6 phosphorylation. The goal of the present study was to define the mechanism(s) by which leucine modulates the synthesis of the translationally regulated proteins ODC and eEF1A. ECL detection reagents and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig and donkey anti-rabbit Ig were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was obtained from Bio-Rad. [35S]Easytag Express Protein Labeling Mix was from NEN Life Science Products. DMEM lacking leucine was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The antibody against p70S6k was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The antibody against eEF1A was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The antibody against Akt, and the antibody that specifically recognizes Akt phosphorylated on Ser473 were purchased from New England BioLabs. The anti-phosphopeptide antibody specific for phosphorylated S6 was a kind gift from Dr. Morris J. Birnbaum (Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania). L6 myoblasts were grown in culture in 100-mm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Labs, Inc), 100 units/ml benzylpenicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cells were grown to approximately 70% confluence and were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Serum-free DMEM lacking leucine was then added to the dishes, and the cells were returned to the incubator for 60 min. At that time the cells were randomly divided into two groups; leucine was added to the dishes in one group to a final concentration equivalent to that present in complete DMEM. When present, rapamycin at a final concentration of 90 nm was added 45 min after the change to serum-free DMEM. The cells were returned to the incubator, and 30 min later, all dishes received 10 μl of [35S]Easytag Express Protein Labeling Mix (22 mCi/ml). Thirty min after the addition of radiolabel, cells were harvested by scraping in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2.5% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 0.8 μm leupeptin, and 0.6 μm pepstatin). L6 myoblasts were treated as described above except they were harvested in ODC assay buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA). ODC activity was determined by measuring the release of 14CO2 froml-[1-14C]ornithine as described previously (10Coleman C.S. Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 24572-24579Google Scholar). L6 myoblasts were grown in culture as described above except 60-mm dishes were used and 50 μl of [35S]Easytag Express Protein Labeling Mix was added 1 h before harvest. eEF1A was immunoprecipitated by incubating 250 μl of cell homogenate with 7 μl of anti-eEF1A antibody and 118 μl of phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. The antibody·antigen complex was collected by incubation for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit Biomag IgG beads (PerSeptive Diagnostics). Before use, the beads were washed in 1% nonfat dry milk in buffer B (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100). The beads were captured using a magnetic stand and were washed twice with buffer B and once with buffer C (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.04% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate). Protein bound to the beads was eluted by resuspension in SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatants were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue dye followed by incubation in En3Hance autoradiography enhancer (NEN Life Science Products) for 1 h at room temperature. The gel was then rinsed with cold water, dried, and exposed to film. Films were analyzed by scanning densitometry. Blots were developed using an Amersham ECL Western blotting Kit and analyzed as described previously (11Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 was quantitated by protein immunoblot analysis of eIF4E immunoprecipitates exactly as described previously (8Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell homogenate were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody raised in mice against rat 4E-BP1 as described previously (8Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were solubilized with SDS sample buffer and then subjected to protein immunoblot analysis using a rabbit anti-rat 4E-BP1 antibody. Aliquots of cell homogenate were combined with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer. For analysis of Akt phosphorylation, duplicate sets of samples were resolved on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins in the gels were transferred to two separate polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. One membrane was probed with anti-Akt antibody, and the second was probed with an antibody specific for Akt phosphorylated at Ser473. For analysis of p70S6k phosphorylation, samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The samples were then analyzed by protein immunoblot analysis using rabbit anti-rat p70S6k polyclonal antibodies as described above. The effect of leucine availability on global protein synthesis in L6 myoblasts was examined by incubating cells in serum-free medium lacking leucine for 1 h followed by the readdition of the deprived amino acid. Protein synthesis was then measured as the incorporation of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine into total cellular protein. Consistent with the results of our earlier study (8Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), leucine deprivation caused a reduction in protein synthesis to 52.8% that of the value observed in cells maintained in complete medium (Table I). Readdition of leucine rapidly returned protein synthesis to near the control value.Table IEffects of leucine readdition on protein synthesis in L6 myoblastsConditionProtein synthesis% controlLeucine-deprived52.8 ± 4.8ap < 0.05 versus leucine readdition.Leucine readdition87.7 ± 5.9L6 myoblasts were grown in culture as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were randomly divided into two groups.

At that time, leucine was returned to some of the cells in group 2, and 30 min later, all cells received 10 μl of [35S]Easytag Express Protein Labeling Mix (NEN Research Products).

The results are expressed as a percent of the value observed in cells maintained in serum-free DMEM containing leucine and represent the mean ±S.E. of six experiments. Within each experiment, 2–3 cultures/condition were individually analyzed. In addition to its effect on global protein synthesis, leucine readdition to leucine-deprived myoblasts caused a relatively greater stimulation in the activity of ODC (Fig.1 A). It has been shown previously that intracellular fluctuations in ODC activity are mediated by changes in the amount of enzyme rather than by post-translational modifications (13Kahana C. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15390-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, leucine readdition caused a 2.8-fold increase in ODC activity, from 0.20 ± 0.02 to 0.55 ± 0.08 nmol of 14CO2 released from [1-14C]ornithine/mg of protein/30 min, in leucine-deprived and leucine-repleted cells, respectively. In contrast, leucine stimulated global protein synthesis 1.7-fold (Table I). Thus, as assessed by enzyme activity, the increase in ODC synthesis was 1.6-fold greater in magnitude than the stimulatory effect of leucine on global protein synthesis. To confirm that the increase in ODC activity was a result of stimulated synthesis of the protein rather than reduced degradation, the effect of leucine on the half-life of ODC activity was determined (14Shantz L.M. Hu R.H. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3265-3269PubMed Google Scholar). The half-life of ODC decreased from 44.2 min in leucine-deprived myoblasts to 31.3 min after the readdition of leucine, suggesting that ODC activity changes caused by leucine actually underestimate the increase in ODC protein. Overall, the results support the conclusion that leucine caused a proportionally greater stimulation in the translation of ODC mRNA compared with global protein synthesis. Previous studies have implicated eIF4E in the stimulation of ODC mRNA translation by the hormone insulin (15Manzella J.M. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. Hershey J.W.B. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2383-2389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An important mechanism for regulating eIF4E availability involves the reversible sequestration of eIF4E into an inactive complex with 4E-BP1 (16Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 17Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donze O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). In the present study, leucine readdition to leucine-deprived myoblasts resulted in a 70% reduction in the amount of 4E-BP1 associated with eIF4E (Fig. 1 B). Association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E is regulated through changes in phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 with hyperphosphorylation being associated with a decrease in the binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E (reviewed in Ref.18Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 293-310PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in the inset to Fig. 1 C, 4E-BP1 was resolved into three bands during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Previous studies have shown that the three bands represent differentially phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 and that the fastest migrating, or α-form, represents the least phosphorylated species of the protein, whereas the slowest migrating, or γ-form, represents the most highly phosphorylated species. Because the γ-form is the only one that does not bind to eIF4E, the data are presented as the proportion of 4E-BP1 in the γ-form. As shown in Fig. 1 C, leucine readdition caused a 2.6-fold increase in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, consistent with the observed decrease in association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E. Leucine readdition to leucine-deprived myoblasts also stimulated the synthesis of eEF1A (Fig. 2 A). However, whereas leucine stimulated global protein synthesis 1.7-fold, readdition of the amino acid to leucine-deprived cells stimulated eEF1A synthesis approximately 4-fold. Thus, the increase in eEF1A synthesis relative to global protein synthesis was 2.4-fold. Synthesis of eEF1A is thought to be regulated through changes in phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (19Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), which is phosphorylated in vivoby p70S6k (20Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Activation of p70S6k by hormones occurs through phosphorylation of the protein at multiple serine and threonine residues (21Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation results in a decrease in mobility of p70S6k during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with several electrophoretic forms of the protein apparent after stimulation of cells by insulin. As described above for 4E-BP1, phosphorylation causes a decrease in the rate of migration during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with the most highly phosphorylated forms exhibiting the greatest activity (21Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, leucine readdition promoted a shift in p70S6k distribution, consistent with the protein becoming more phosphorylated in the presence of the amino acid. To confirm that the changes in p70S6k migration were accompanied by alterations in kinase activity, the phosphorylation state of S6 was examined using an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of the protein. As shown in Fig. 2 C, leucine readdition significantly increased the amount of S6 in the phosphorylated form. Recent studies have shown that a protein kinase referred to as mTOR phosphorylates 4E-BP1 both in vitro and in vivo(22Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 23Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q.P. Kasuga M. Nishimoto I. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26457-26463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mTOR phosphorylates p70S6k on Thr389, a residue whose phosphorylation is associated with activation of the protein (24Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Thus, mTOR plays a key role in regulating the phosphorylation of both 4E-BP1 and p70S6k. To investigate the role of mTOR in the leucine-mediated stimulation of ODC activity and eEF1A synthesis, the studies shown in Figs. 1 and 2were repeated in the presence of a specific inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin. As shown in Fig.3 A, rapamycin did not prevent the stimulation of global protein synthesis associated with leucine readdition to leucine-deprived cells. In contrast, rapamycin prevented the leucine-induced stimulation of both ODC activity (Fig.3 B) and eEF1A synthesis (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3 D, rapamycin prevented the leucine-induced reduction in 4E-BP1 associated with eIF4E. Finally, rapamycin not only prevented phosphorylation of p70S6k but resulted in a complete shift in p70S6k to the fastest migrating form (Fig. 3 E), suggesting that p70S6k was completely dephosphorylated. The failure of leucine to stimulate p70S6k phosphorylation in the presence of rapamycin was reflected in the lack of change in S6 phosphorylation in response to leucine readdition in cells treated with the inhibitor (Fig.3 F). Overall, the results support the conclusion that leucine stimulates both 4E-BP1 and p70S6k phosphorylation through an mTOR-dependent process. The mechanism through which leucine stimulates mTOR is unknown. Hormones such as insulin stimulate mTOR through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (reviewed in Ref. 25Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). However, two recent studies (26Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 27Patti M.-E. Brambilla E. Luzi L. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that leucine does not stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in cells in culture. An alternative mechanism for the activation of mTOR by leucine may involve phosphorylation of the mTOR regulator, Akt (also known as protein kinase B). Akt is an intermediate in the insulin signaling pathway and lies downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase but upstream of mTOR (28Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt is caused by phosphorylation of the protein at two distinct sites, one of which is Ser473. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of leucine on the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 was examined. As a positive control, phosphorylation of Akt in response to insulin treatment was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4, neither stimulation by insulin nor leucine had any effect on the cellular content of Akt. However, insulin, but not leucine, stimulated Akt phosphorylation. The results suggest that Akt is not a component of the signaling pathway through which leucine acts to stimulate mTOR or 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. In a previous study (8Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we reported that leucine availability affects both eIF2B activity and formation of the active eIF4E·eIF4G complex. Changes in global protein synthesis were shown to be directly related to changes in eIF2B activity but not to modulation of the eIF4 complex. Therefore, we proposed that leucine-induced changes in eIF4E availability might be important in regulating the translation of mRNAs coding for specific proteins. In its role as the m7GTP cap-binding protein, eIF4E is key in determining which mRNAs will be translated. Thus, those mRNAs that bind well to eIF4E presumably are translated most efficiently, and those that bind poorly are not. This fact is emphasized by studies using cells that overexpress eIF4E. In such cells, the mRNAs encoding proteins that have roles in cellular growth and development, such as ODC (15Manzella J.M. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. Hershey J.W.B. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2383-2389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2313-2316PubMed Google Scholar), cyclin D1 (30Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), myc (31De Benedetti A. Joshi B. Graff J.R. Zimmer S.G. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1994; 2: 347-371Google Scholar), and P23 (32Bommer U.-A. Lazaris-Karatzas A. De Benedetti A. Nurnberg P. Benndorf R. Bielka H. Sonenberg N. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 633-641PubMed Google Scholar), are preferentially translated. In contrast, decreasing the amount of eIF4E using an antisense RNA approach specifically reduces P23 expression (32Bommer U.-A. Lazaris-Karatzas A. De Benedetti A. Nurnberg P. Benndorf R. Bielka H. Sonenberg N. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 633-641PubMed Google Scholar). A common link among these proteins is that the mRNAs coding for them typically contain 5′-untranslated regions that are predicted to contain a high degree of secondary structure. The importance of a highly structured untranslated region in regulating the translation of these mRNAs has been demonstrated by transfecting cells with a series of vectors expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene containing sequences in the 5′-untranslated region predicted to form different amounts of secondary structure (33Koromilas A.E. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In wild type NIH-3T3 cells, increasing the secondary structure of the 5′-untranslated region caused a dramatic decrease in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase synthesis. In contrast, in NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing eIF4E, only a minor decrease in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase synthesis was observed. Thus, an increase in the amount of eIF4E relieved the translational repression caused by a structured 5′-untranslated region. In contrast to the artificial manipulation of eIF4E availability using overexpression and antisense approaches, the present study used a more physiological approach to vary eIF4E availability; i.e.through changes in association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1. The release of eIF4E from the eIF4E·4E-BP1 complex was shown to correlate with increased ODC activity. Because ODC activity is a direct reflection of the amount of ODC protein present in the cell (13Kahana C. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15390-15393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it can be assumed that the leucine-induced increase in ODC activity represents an increase in ODC synthesis. Overall, the results suggest that leucine specifically stimulates the synthesis of ODC through an increase in eIF4E availability. A second group of translationally regulated mRNAs is typified by ribosomal proteins and elongation factors eEF1A and eEF2. mRNAs belonging to this group usually have short 5′-untranslated regions containing little or no predicted secondary structure and have an oligopyrimidine tract at the 5′ terminus. As with proteins like ODC (34Manzella J.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11817-11822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), synthesis of the ribosomal proteins is specifically increased by growth factors such as insulin (reviewed in Ref. 35Meyuhas O. Avni D. Shama S. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. 30. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 363-388Google Scholar). However, translational regulation of ribosomal protein synthesis is still observed in cells overexpressing eIF4E (36Shama S. Avni D. Frederickson R.M. Sonenberg N. Meyuhas O. Gene Expre. 1995; 4: 241-252PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in cells containing a targeted disruption of the p70S6k gene (p70S6k −/− cells), serum does not stimulate eEF1A mRNA translation (20Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As expected, in p70S6k −/−cells, serum does not stimulate S6 phosphorylation even though 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated to the same extent as in cells expressing wild type p70S6k. These studies suggest that regulation of ribosomal protein synthesis occurs through an eIF4E/4E-BP1-independent mechanism that is regulated by changes in phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. In vivo, phosphorylation of S6 is mediated by p70S6k (20Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of S6 by p70S6k is associated with increased translation of TOPS mRNAs. The mechanism involved in the stimulation of TOPS mRNA translation in response to S6 phosphorylation is unknown. However, S6 present in ribosomes has been cross-linked to both initiation factors and mRNA (37Nygard O. Nilsson L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of S6 might alter the interaction of the protein with either of these components and promote translation of TOPS mRNAs. As reported previously for insulin, in the present study the leucine-stimulated phosphorylation of S6 was associated with activation of p70S6k. Furthermore, phosphorylation of S6 correlated with increased synthesis of eEF1A. eEF1A synthesis, S6 phosphorylation, and p70S6k activation were all blocked by rapamycin, suggesting that mTOR is required for this response. Indeed, mTOR has been implicated not only in the protein synthesis response to amino acids but also in the regulation of protein degradation by amino acids (38Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Hara et al. (26Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a p70S6k variant that is rapamycin-resistant is also resistant to amino acid deprivation, suggesting that amino acids signal to p70Sk6 through mTOR. Activation of mTOR may also be involved in the amino acid-regulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, because in the present study, rapamycin prevented both the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the stimulation of ODC activity caused by leucine in L6 myoblasts. This idea is supported by a recent study showing that 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro by mTOR (22Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The question remains as to the mechanism through which amino acids activate mTOR. Hormones such as insulin activate mTOR through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase dependent pathway involving activation of Akt (reviewed in Ref. 39Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism through which Akt activates mTOR is unknown, a recent study showed that stimulation of Akt causes an increase in mTOR kinase activity as well as enhances 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (28Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). However, in that study, the authors were unable to phosphorylate mTOR with purified Akt, suggesting that activation of mTOR by Akt is indirect (i.e. there may be another kinase between Akt and mTOR in the insulin signaling pathway). In the present study, leucine stimulated phosphorylation of two proteins downstream of mTOR, 4E-BP1 and p70S6k, even though Akt was not phosphorylated. In similar studies by others, amino acids failed to stimulate either phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (26Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 27Patti M.-E. Brambilla E. Luzi L. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Akt (26Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that amino acids stimulate mTOR directly or through activation of a putative mTOR kinase residing downstream of Akt. It is noteworthy that in other studies (40Wang X. Campbell L.E. Miller C.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 41Xu G. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Lin T.-A. Lawrence J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28178-28184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, reportedly prevents the stimulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by amino acids. Based on this observation, it is tempting to speculate that activation of mTOR by amino acids might be cell-type-specific. However, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, amino acid-stimulated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was found to be both inhibited by wortmannin (42Wang X. Flynn A. Waskiewicz A.J. Webb B.L.J. Vries R.G. Baines I.A. Cooper J.A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9373-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt activation (26Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that wortmannin is inhibiting a kinase downstream of Akt or is inhibiting a step that is required but not sufficient for amino acid-mediated mTOR activation. In summary, leucine specifically stimulates the synthesis of both ODC and eEF1A. The stimulation is associated with increased availability of eIF4E as well as phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. Finally, the stimulation occurs through a rapamycin-sensitive pathway, suggesting that the effect of leucine is through activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. We are grateful to Joan McGwire for technical help."

In the present study, we asked if the two isoforms differ in the profile of prostanoids that ultimately arise from their action on arachidonic acid. Resident peritoneal macrophages contained only cyclooxygenase-1 and synthesized (from either endogenous or exogenous arachidonic acid) a balance of four major prostanoids: prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, prostaglandin D2, and 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid. Prostaglandin E2 was a minor fifth product, although these cells efficiently converted exogenous prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin E2. By contrast, induction of cyclooxygenase-2 with lipopol- ysaccharide resulted in the preferential production of prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2. This shift in product profile was accentuated if cyclooxygenase-1 was permanently inactivated with aspirin before cyclooxygenase-2 induction. The conversion of exogenous prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin E2 was only modestly increased by lipopolysaccharide treatment. Thus, cyclooxygenase-2 induction leads to a shift in arachidonic acid metabolism from the production of several prostanoids with diverse effects as mediated by cyclooxygenase-1 to the preferential synthesis of two prostanoids, prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2, which evoke common effects at the cellular level.

These mediators exert a wide range of effects on processes such as smooth muscle tone, vascular permeability, cellular proliferation, and inflammatory/immune function. In many cases, different PGs will have opposing actions. For example, PGD2and thromboxane (TxA2) cause smooth muscle contraction, whereas PGE2 and prostacyclin (PGI2) cause relaxation (reviewed in Refs. 1Peters-Golden M. Lipscomb M. Russell S.

Similarly, TxA2increases, but PGI2 inhibits, platelet aggregation. The net effect evoked by PGs may, ultimately, depend on the balance of these opposing forces. The initial step in the synthesis of PGs from AA is mediated by cyclooxygenase (COX, also known as prostaglandin H synthase or prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase), of which two isoforms are recognized (reviewed in Refs. 2Vane J. Bakhle Y. Botting R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar, 3Dubois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S.

Med. 1998; 105: 8S-12SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). COX-1 is expressed constitutively in most cell types, and prostanoids derived from COX-1 are thought to be important in gastric and renal homeostasis. COX-2, on the other hand, is the product of an immediate early gene and is rapidly expressed only after exposure of cells to hormones, mitogenic stimuli, and inflammatory mediators, like bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The induction of COX-2, with the resultant production of prostanoids, can contribute to parturition, inflammation, pain, fever, and certain types of cancer. The ability of aspirin to permanently inactivate both COX isoforms indiscriminately explains both its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, through COX-2 inhibition, as well as its damaging effects on the gastric mucosa, through COX-1 inhibition. Both COX isoforms convert AA to PGH2, which is then acted upon by discrete PG synthases to give rise to the different PG species. The current model for the regulation of PG synthesis posits that the amount of each PG is determined by the availability of the substrate AA (through the action of phospholipases A2) and by the total mass of COX protein present. According to this model, COX-2 induction results in more COX protein, more processing of AA to PGH2, and more of each type of PG. The profile of different PGs produced by a given cell type is thought to be determined primarily by the relative amounts of the distal PG synthases present in that cell type. In simple cases, as when a single distal enzyme predominates, this model may be accurate. However, when several different PG synthases exist in a single cell, the opportunity exists for COX-1 and COX-2 to selectively deliver PGH2 to different distal enzymes and thus produce different PGs. If so, then COX-2 induction and action could result in a shift in the profile of PGs, rather than simply an increase in total PG production. This could then change the integrated prostanoid signal that is delivered to target cells. In the current study, we used intact rat peritoneal macrophages (PMs) to compare the products derived from either COX-1 or COX-2 action on AA. These primary cells were chosen because they contain several PG synthases and would thus allow detection of selective metabolism of PGH2, if it existed. Freshly isolated PMs, which lack COX-2, provide an indication of the prostanoids that are derived from COX-1 action. By contrast, cells treated first with aspirin to permanently inactivate COX-1 and then with LPS to induce COX-2 demonstrate those prostanoids that are derived from COX-2. Our results indicate that AA metabolized by COX-1 gives rise to balanced amounts of PGI2, TxA2, PGD2, and 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) as well as smaller amounts of PGE2, whereas COX-2 preferentially metabolizes AA to PGI2 and PGE2. Because PGI2 and PGE2 can evoke similar effects on target cells and tissues, the result of COX-2 induction may be a dramatic shift in the balance of PG action. Resident PMs were obtained by peritoneal lavage of specific pathogen-free, female Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Portage, MI) as described previously (5Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Hyzy R. Shelly C. Toews G.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar). Lavaged cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended, and subjected to hypotonic lysis to remove contaminating erythrocytes. Cells were then centrifuged again and resuspended at 0.5 × 106 cells ml−1 in M199 and either maintained in suspension in Teflon tubes (“freshly isolated cells”) or plated on 24-well plates (for metabolic studies) or glass slides (for imaging). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. As described previously (6Wilborn J. DeWitt D. Peters-Golden M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L294-L301PubMed Google Scholar), cells were disrupted by sonication (10 bursts at 20% duty cycle) in ice-cold homogenizing buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, pH 7.4) and separated into soluble and pelletable fractions by centrifugation (100,000 ×g, 30 min, 4 °C); and protein concentrations were determined by a modified Coomassie Blue dye binding assay (Pierce). Samples containing 10 μg of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Following blocking, membranes were probed with antibodies to COX-1 (rabbit polyclonal raised against sheep seminal vesicle COX (7Smith W. Rollins T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 86: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)) and COX-2 (rabbit polyclonal raised against murine COX-2, from Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI; 1:10,000) and then peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000) with ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were prepared for indirect immunofluorescent microscopy as described previously (8Brock T.G. Paine III, R. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following mounting on glass slides, cells were fixed using methanol (−20 °C, 30 min), permeabilized with acetone (−20 °C, 3 min), air-dried, rehydrated with sterile PBS, and blocked for 30 min using 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 1% (v/v) nonimmune goat serum. Preparations were then probed with antibodies to either COX-1 or COX-2, each at 1:200 in PBS supplemented with 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200, Sigma). Preparations were examined and photographed using a Zeiss Aristoplan microscope equipped for epifluorescence. For overnight incubations, cells were adhered for 1 h, washed twice with sterile PBS, and cultured overnight in M199 containing 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). In some experiments, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid (ASA); 200 μm) was included during the 1 h adherence phase; this treatment did not affect cell adherence or survival, as determined by trypan blue staining and visualization of cells. During overnight incubation, some cells were cultured with LPS (1 μg/ml), TNF-α (100 ng/ml), IL-1 (5 ng/ml), or polymyxin B sulfate (10 μg/ml). For prelabeling of cellular lipids, 0.5 μCi of [3H]AA (specific activity, 76–100 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was included in the incubation medium. Before cell stimulation, the unincorporated label was removed by washing three times with PBS. Cell stimulation was with 1 μm A23187 for 15 min at 37 °C. Inhibitors added during cell stimulation in designated experiments included NS-398 (3 μm) and indomethacin (1 μm). Metabolism of exogenous AA was evaluated by the addition of 0.5 μCi of [3H]AA (∼5 pm) to unlabeled cells during stimulation with A23187; the addition of additional cold, carrier AA did not alter results. Metabolism of exogenous PGH2 was evaluated by the addition of 0.1 μm[3H]PGH2 (for HPLC analysis) or unlabeled PGH2 (for enzyme immunoassay analysis) to unlabeled cells during stimulation with A23187. Radiolabeled eicosanoids were assayed as described (5Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Hyzy R. Shelly C. Toews G.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, eicosanoids were extracted from culture medium using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Associates, Milford, MA), dried under nitrogen, resuspended in water:acetonitrile (2:1), and separated by reverse-phase HPLC using a Waters μBondapak C18 column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid. Radiolabeled products were identified by their coelution with authentic standards and quantitated by on-line radiodetection. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) of conditioned media was performed according to the supplier's instructions (Cayman Chemicals). Statistical significance was evaluated by paired Student's t test using p < 0.05. Freshly isolated PMs were evaluated for the presence of the two COX isoforms. By immunoblot analysis, fresh PMs contained abundant COX-1 in membrane-containing fractions but lacked detectable COX-2 (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, COX-1, but not COX-2, was detectable in individual PMs by immunofluorescent microscopy (Fig. 1 B). By this technique, COX-1 appeared to extensively decorate membranes throughout the cell, including perinuclear membranes and the endoplasmic reticulum. To determine the profile of prostanoids synthesized by COX-1 alone, freshly isolated PMs were prelabeled with [3H]AA for 2 h, maintained in suspension in Teflon tubes, washed to remove the unincorporated label, and stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μm, 15 min, 37 °C) to release cellular AA from endogenous membrane phospholipids. By this method, several products were identified after HPLC separation with approximately 60% of the released AA converted to COX metabolites, including PGI2 (detected as 6-keto-PGF1α), TxA2 (detected as TxB2), PGE2, PGD2, and HHT and 30% metabolized to products of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway (Fig.2 A). This profile is similar to that reported previously (5Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Hyzy R. Shelly C. Toews G.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar). The production of prostanoids was inhibited by indomethacin (1 μm), a nonselective COX inhibitor, resulting in increases in free AA and 12-HETE but not the 5-lipoxygenase products, leukotriene (LT)B4 and 5-HETE (Fig. 2 B). Pooled results from four independent experiments indicated that freshly isolated PMs generated a balance of four prostanoids from endogenous AA: PGI2, TxA2, PGD2, and HHT (Table I). PGE2 was a minor fifth product, accounting for less than 10% of all COX-1 products. Similar results were obtained when the AA was supplied exogenously; if trace levels of [3H]AA were provided to fresh PMs in the absence of an agonist, then prostanoid ratios similar to those generated by prelabeled, A23187-stimulated cells were produced (TableI). Acute stimulation of cells with A23187 in the presence of exogenously supplied radiolabeled AA increased the synthesis of radiolabeled 5-lipoxygenase products but did not significantly change the ratios of the COX-1 products (data not shown).Table IProducts from COX-1 in freshly isolated PMsProduct6-keto-PGF1αTxB2PGE2PGD2HHTFresh PMsFrom endogenous AA19.1 (8.7)25.5 (6.1)7.1 (5.1)20.3 (10.3)28.0 (8.4)From exogenous AA17.1 (6.4)17.8 (5.3)9.8 (4.1)24.5 (8.4)30.8 (7.6)Cells were either prelabeled with [3H]AA for 2 h, washed, and stimulated with A23187 (1 μm, 10 min, 37 °C) or given exogenous [3H]AA without A23187 (2 h, 37 °C).

COX-2 induction in rat PMs was pronounced in response to LPS (1 μg/ml, 24 h), appearing as two bands of approximately 69 and 70 kDa on immunoblots (Fig.3 A). By indirect immunofluorescent microscopy, the degree of expression of COX-2 protein varied greatly among cells within a culture treated with LPS for 24 h (Fig. 3 B). Some cells were largely negative for COX-2, some cells showed intermediate expression with COX-2 restricted to the nuclear envelope and perinuclear membranes, and others showed that COX-2 was concentrated on the nuclear envelope and was also abundant on the endoplasmic reticulum. By Nomarski optics, it appeared that cells staining greatest for COX-2 were spread and commonly binucleate, whereas those staining the least were rounded and mononucleate. In parallel experiments, all cells excluded trypan blue dye, indicating that the rounded cells were not dead. COX-2 protein was also induced to a lesser extent by TNF-α (100 ng/ml), appearing as a single 69-kDa band (Fig. 3 A). There was no detectable induction by IL-1 (5 ng/ml). COX-1 expression was unchanged following treatment with LPS, TNF-α, or IL-1 (Fig. 3 A), and it was not altered by overnight incubation alone, ASA pretreatment, or the combination of ASA pretreatment and LPS treatment (Fig. 3 C). Based on these results, subsequent experiments focused on LPS-induced COX-2. According to current models, the result of elevated mass of COX protein via COX-2 induction should be a nonselective increase in the synthesis of all PGs that the given cell type can make. However, when PMs were treated with LPS for 24 h to induce COX-2, washed, and stimulated with A23187 (1 μm, 15 min, 37 °C) to release AA from cell membranes, selective changes in PG production were readily apparent, as compared with that seen in freshly isolated cells. These PMs, which contained both active COX-1 and COX-2, synthesized the same products as freshly isolated PMs (Fig.4 A). However, following LPS treatment, the proportion of radiolabeled AA metabolized to PGE2 was increased, whereas that converted to TxA2, as well as the 5-lipoxygenase product 5-HETE, was reduced. One explanation for the altered PG profile following LPS treatment would be that COX-2 preferentially metabolizes AA to PGI2 and PGE2, whereas the other prostanoids were derived from COX-1 action. To address this, COX-1 was irreversibly inactivated in fresh PMs with ASA, the ASA was washed away, and COX-2 was induced with LPS for 24 h. The treatment with ASA (200 μm) alone for 1 h effectively eliminated COX activity, and continued culture (after washing to remove ASA) in LPS-free medium for 24 h did not result in significant new COX activity (Fig. 4 B). The cells treated with ASA that were washed and given LPS produced predominantly PGI2 and PGE2, as well as LTB4 (Fig. 4 C). These cells, with only COX-2 active, had approximately 85% of all released AA converted to PGs, as compared with 60% in COX-1-containing fresh PMs. Interestingly, there were only minor changes in LTB4 production. Finally, the production of PGs was inhibited by the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398; in cells pretreated with ASA and then given LPS to induce COX-2, PGE2 synthesis was completely inhibited by 1 μm NS-398, as determined by EIA, with an IC50 of 0.12 μm NS-398. In contrast, in freshly isolated PMs, 50% inhibition of PGE2synthesis required 8.3 μm NS-398 (approximately 70-fold more than the IC50 of ASA-pretreated, LPS-treated cells); PGE2 synthesis was inhibited only 75% by 30 μm NS-398, the highest dose tested. Pooled data from three independent experiments indicated that cells given LPS overnight and thus with both active COX isoforms produced predominantly PGI2, TxB2, and PGE2, with PGD2 and HHT being less pronounced (TableII). This pattern was also generally seen when the radiolabeled AA was supplied exogenously. Pretreatment of PMs with ASA to inactivate COX-1 and thus leave COX-2 as the only active isoform following LPS treatment resulted in PGI2 and PGE2 being the major products of stimulated cells, with TxB2 occasionally found in significant amounts (Table II). In contrast, PGD2 and HHT were barely detectable. Similar results were obtained if radiolabeled AA was supplied exogenously and cells were not acutely stimulated. The two products, PGI2and PGE2, constituted 85.8 ± 14.8% of all PGs released via COX-2, as compared with 26.2 ± 13.9% of all PGs released from cells containing only COX-1 (Table I). PMs incubated overnight in LPS-free medium with or without polymyxin B, which binds and inactivates LPS, generated the same profile of products as freshly isolated PMs, except that PGD2 tended to be reduced and LTB4 elevated with overnight culture (data not shown).Table IIProducts from LPS-treated PMsProduct6-keto-PGF1αTxB2PGE2PGD2HHTPMs given LPS for 24 hFrom endogenous AA32.9 (11.3)21.9 (8.0)30.4 (12)4.7 (3.4)10.1 (6.1)From exogenous AA31.5 (8.2)8.21 (5.7)36.7 (12)7.4 (4.8)16.2 (2.6)PMs ASA pretreated, then given LPS for 24 hFrom endogenous AA41.5 (9.9)7.6 (6.1)44.4 (11)1.8 (2.5)4.8 (6.7)From exogenous AA40.0 (2.7)13.6 (7.0)27.7 (8.0)1.0 (1.3)18.7 (9.2)Cells were adhered in media with or without ASA (200 μm) for 1 hr, washed, and incubated in media with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 h with [3H]AA.

Values are the mean of three experiments; S.E. is in parentheses. A second possible explanation for the altered PG profile following LPS treatment would be that LPS selectively changed the amount or activity of all enzymes that act distal to the COX isozymes. Specifically, LPS might have had up-regulating effects on PGI2 and PGE2 synthases and down-regulatory effects on synthases giving TxA2, PGD2, and HHT. To address this possibility, we examined the effects of LPS on the processing of the COX product, PGH2. Exogenous PGH2 (0.1 μm) was efficiently metabolized to a variety of PGs by freshly isolated PMs (Fig.5 A). The most abundant product was PGE2 at about 24% of all recovered product. This was surprising because freshly isolated PMs released little PGE2 from either endogenous AA (following ionophore stimulation) or exogenous AA (Table I). A similar profile of products was obtained when PGH2 was given to unfractionated cell lysates (data not shown). When PMs were first treated with LPS for 24 h, the proportion of PGH2 converted to PGE2 increased from 24 to approximately 30% of all recovered disintegrations/min (Fig. 5 B), consistent with a slight increase in PGE2 synthase activity. However, in three independent experiments using both whole cells and cell lysates, there were no significant differences between freshly isolated and LPS-treated PMs in the profiles of products generated from PGH2. The increase in PGE2 synthase activity was further assessed using EIAs to specifically measure PGE2 production. Following ionophore stimulation to liberate endogenous AA, freshly isolated PMs made significant amounts of PGE2, and PGE2 production following acute stimulation increased approximately 2.5-fold when PMs were treated with LPS for 6 or 24 h (Fig. 6 A). Exogenous PGH2 was efficiently converted to PGE2 by untreated, freshly isolated PMs, consistent with the HPLC analysis. After 6 or 24 h of LPS treatment, PGE2 production from PGH2 increased significantly. However, this increase, although statistically significant, was only by 30%. These effects were further extended to TNF-α, which also induced COX-2 synthesis in these cells (Fig. 3). The treatment of PMs with TNF-α for 24 h also increased PGE2 synthesis from AA by 3-fold, whereas it increased PGE2 production from PGH2 again by only 30% (Fig. 6 B). It should be noted that PGE2 production from PGH2, as presented in Fig.6, is measured on a different scale than PGE2 production from AA, with the former being 8 times the latter. In this study, we found that freshly isolated PMs, which have COX-1 but not COX-2, make a balance of four major prostanoids from AA. A fifth prostanoid, PGE2, is only a minor product, although these cells can readily convert PGH2 to PGE2. Similar results were obtained if PMs were maintained overnight in LPS-free medium. In stark contrast, when PMs were incubated with LPS to induce COX-2, the profile of PG products shifted to emphasize two PGs, PGI2 and PGE2. Pretreatment with ASA to inactivate COX-1, leaving COX-2 as the only active isoform, accentuated this change. These results were surprising because increasing COX mass through LPS treatment did not result in an across-the-board increase in production of all COX products. Instead, COX-2 induction caused a profile shift characterized by preferential synthesis of PGI2 and PGE2 with reduced production of TxB2, PGD2, and HHT. A shift in product profile may arise from a change in the amounts of each of the distal enzymes, which process the COX product, PGH2. Indeed, Oh-ishi and colleagues (9Matsumoto H. Naraba H. Murakami M. Kudo I. Yamaki K. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Naraba H. Maurakami M. Matsumoto H. Shimbara S. Ueno A. Kudo I. Oh-ishi S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2974-2982PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that PGE2 synthase activity was induced by LPS in inflammatory PMs, whereas PGD2 synthase and TxA2 synthase activities were unaffected. In their studies, cell lysates from these cells lacked any detectable PGE2synthase activity; this would serve to make this enzymatic step rate-limiting in the synthesis of PGE2. In this study, using resident PMs, we found significant PGE2 synthase activity in both whole cells and cell lysates before treatment with LPS as reported previously (6Wilborn J. DeWitt D. Peters-Golden M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L294-L301PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with LPS resulted in a small (30%) but significant increase in PGE2 synthase activity. This change certainly may contribute to the increase in PGE2 production in LPS-treated cells. However, two results suggest that changes in distal enzymes were not sufficient to account for the change in PG profile. First, the changes in product profile from distal enzymes alone (Fig. 5) were not comparable to the changes in products derived from COX isoforms plus distal enzymes (Figs. 2 and4). Second, the magnitude of increase in PGE2 production from PGH2 was much less than that from AA (Fig. 6). The difference in scale for PGE2 synthesis from PGH2 versus AA, noted in Fig. 6, argues that the activity of COX, not PGE2 synthase, is rate-limiting in the production of PGE2, and thus the small changes in PGE2 synthase activity cannot account for the increased production of PGE2 following LPS treatment. These results suggest that other factors contributed to the shift in product profile following COX-2 induction. Previous researchers have suggested that the COX-1 and COX-2 metabolic pathways are at least partially independent from one another, particularly in terms of when and where the pathways are expressed (11Reddy S. Herschman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Masferrer J. Zweifel B. Manning P. Hauser S. Leahy K. Smith W. Isakson P. Seibert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3228-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 13Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we propose that the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways differ in the profile of their products. A model of this relationship in PMs, based on the results of this study, is given in Fig.7. According to this model, AA metabolism by COX-1 produces PGH2 that is directed in a balanced way to enzymes that give rise to PGI2, TxA2, PGD2, and HHT. In contrast, COX-2 metabolism is much more tightly coupled to the PGI2- and PGE2-synthesizing enzymes than to other downstream enzymes. Then the result of COX-2 induction by inflammatory mediators is not simply an increase in all PGs that a given cell type can produce. Instead, there is a shift in the balance of PGs toward the preferential production of PGI2 and PGE2. A simple explanation for the shift in product profile relates to the subcellular distribution of the metabolic enzymes. First, the two COX isoforms appear to differ in their subcellular distribution. COX-1 is dispersed throughout the intracellular membrane system, whereas COX-2 is preferentially accumulated on and around the nuclear envelope (14Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar,15Zhang Y. Cao H. Graf B. Meekins H. Smith T. Phipps R. J. Immunol. 1997; 160: 1053-1057Google Scholar). It should be noted that a recent study has questioned whether this difference is real or artifactual (16Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), but our results support distinct distributions for the two isoforms (Fig.8, see also Figs. 1 and 3). Second, the different PG synthases appear to differ in their subcellular distribution, as has been recently reviewed (17Brock T. Peters-Golden M. Szczeklik A. Gryglewski R. Vane J. Eicosanoids, Aspirin and Asthma. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 91-109Google Scholar). For example, the glutathione-requiring form of PGD2 synthase is found in the cytoplasm of a variety of cell types (18Ujihara M. Urade Y. Eguchi N. Hayashi H. Ikai K. Hayaishi O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 19Urade Y. Ujihara M. Horiguchi Y. Ikai K. Hayaishi O. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2982-2989PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PGE2synthase activity has been localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope (20Mukherjee E. Ghosh D. Prostaglandins. 1989; 38: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Finally, different pools of AA, liberated by distinct phospholipase A2 isoforms, may feed into the different COX pathways (21Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3231-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, COX-1, because of its diffuse subcellular distribution, may deliver PGH2 relatively nonselectively to downstream enzymes. On the other hand, COX-2 may monopolize AA liberated from the nuclear envelope, e.g. by the action of the 85-kDa phospholipase A2 acting at that site (24Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 25Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 318: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and preferentially deliver PGH2 to distal enzymes located on and around the nuclear envelope, such as PGE2 synthase and, perhaps, PGI2 synthase. The paired production of PGI2 and PGE2 is a common response to inflammatory mediators in a wide range of settings. Both PGI2 and PGE2 increased significantly in vascular endothelial cells in response to LPS or TNF-α (27Riedo F. Munford R. Campbell W. Reisch J. Chien K. Gerard R. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3506-3512PubMed Google Scholar), in ciliary epithelial cells in response to LPS (28Helbig H. Kittredge K. Gurley R. Thurau S. Palestine A. Nussen-blatt R. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), in gingival fibroblasts in response to IL-1 or TNF-α (29Modeer T. Bengtsson A. Rolla G. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1996; 23: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and in myometrial cells in response to IL-1 or TNF-α (30Hertelendy F. Romero R. Molnar M. Todd H. Baldassare J. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1993; 30: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similarly, PGI2and PGE2 production by aortic endothelial cells was elevated in response to xenoreactive antibodies and complement (31Bustos M. Coffman T. Saadi S. Platt J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1150-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Inex vivo culture, the saphenous vein released PGI2 and PGE2 in response to IL-1 (32Bishop-Bailey D. Pepper J. Haddad E. Newton R. Larkin S. Mitchell J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1644-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In whole animal models, plasma levels of PGI2 and PGE2 were elevated when TNF-α was administered intravenously to rats (33Fletcher J. Collins J. Graves E. Luterman A. Williams M. Izenberg S. Rodning C. Ann. Surg. 1993; 217: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or sheep (34Wheeler A. Hardie W. Bernard G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 145: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and also when bleomycin was given intratracheally to hamsters (35Chandler D. Giri S. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1983; 128: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because COX-2 induction is common to all these experimental systems, these results are consistent with the thesis that COX-2 preferentially metabolizes AA to PGI2 and PGE2. What is the impact of the paired production of PGI2 and PGE2? Both PGs evoke a number of common cellular responses, including smooth muscle relaxation, decreased fibroblast and smooth muscle proliferation, diminished collagen deposition, and decreased leukocyte function. Although other signaling pathways are also used, both PGs evoke many of these effects through receptor-mediated elevation of cAMP (reviewed in Refs. 34Wheeler A. Hardie W. Bernard G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 145: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and 35Chandler D. Giri S. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1983; 128: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Also through cAMP signaling, both PGI2 and PGE2 inhibit activation-initiated responses of many leukocytes, including neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and some T lymphocytes (reviewed in Refs. 36Phipps R. Stein S. Roper R. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar and 37Kunkel S. Chensue S. Adv. Inflamm. Res. 1984; 7: 93-102Google Scholar). Thus, PGI2 and PGE2inhibit cytokine production by Th1-type lymphocytes, resulting in decreased secretion of IL-2, interferon-γ, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF-α (38Betz M. Fox B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 108-113PubMed Google Scholar, 39Fedyk E. Brown D. Phipps R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 407: 237-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling through cAMP has variable effects on Th2-type lymphocytes, and thus these PGs may either have no effect or actually increase the production of Th2-type cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 (40Hilkens C. Vermeulen H. van Neerven R. Snijdewint F. Wierenga E. Kapsenberg M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the induction of COX-2 may, by shifting the profile of PG secretion, serve to actually diminish the inflammatory response in some tissues. Thus, in the absence of inflammatory mediators, COX-1 serves to generate a balance of PGs that may maintain a level of system homeostasis. Inflammatory mediators, like bacterial LPS, would evoke a number of responses, including the synthesis of Th1-type cytokines and COX-2. Our data, as well as the studies cited above, indicate that COX-2 metabolism of AA will tip the balance of secreted PGs to emphasize PGI2 and PGE2. Via cAMP signaling, these PGs would subsequently begin the resolution of the inflammatory response through the suppression of the synthesis of Th1-type cytokines and, at least indirectly, favor the development of a Th2-type profile of cytokines. According to this model, a defect in the ability to induce COX-2 expression would both suppress the synthesis of PGI2 and PGE2 and augment inflammation in some circumstances. Indeed, fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a severely impaired capacity to express COX-2, but not COX-1, and make much less PGE2 than do control fibroblasts (41Wilborn J. Crofford L. Burdick M. Kunkel S. Strieter R. Peters-Golden M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The failure to induce COX-2 and produce prostanoids that can suppress inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis can thus contribute to disease progression."

Here, we describe the first continuous insect cell line that produces prophenoloxidase (PPO). This cell line (4a-3B) expresses constitutively six PPO genes, three of which are novel (PPO4, PPO5, andPPO6). The PPO genes show distinct temporal expression profiles in the intact mosquito, spanning stages from the embryo to the adult in an overlapping manner. Transient induction of larva-specific PPO genes in blood-fed adult females suggests that the developmental hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone may be involved in PPO gene regulation. Indeed, exposure of 4a-3B cells to 20-hydroxyecdysone in culture results in induction of those PPO genes that are mainly expressed in early developmental stages, and repression of PPO5, which is preferentially expressed at the adult stage. The cell line shows bacteria-induced immune transcripts that encode defensin and Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein, but no induction of PPO transcripts. This cell line most likely derives from a hemocyte lineage, and represents an appropriate in vitro model for the study of the humoral and cellular immune defenses of A. gambiae.

However, within the A. gambiaecomplex mosquitoes may differ in their efficiency of transmitting malaria (1Coluzzi M. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Transmission requires completion of a complex sporogonic cycle, which takes place over 2 weeks within the mosquito and can be aborted by innate immune responses, such as the encapsulation of early oocysts soon after invasion of the midgut (2Collins F.H. Sakai R.K. Vernick K.D. Paskewitz S. Seeley D.C. Miller L.H. Collins W.E. Campbell C.C. Gwadz R.W. Science. 1986; 234: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Genes responsible for such refractory phenotypes would be candidates for inclusion in a vector control strategy based on genetically manipulated mosquitoes (3Collins F.H. Besansky N.J.

Vertebrate immune defense has been attributed to two general systems, innate and adaptive immunity, which are interconnected (5Medzhitov R. Janeway C.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In contrast, insect immune defense lacks the adaptive component and therefore an antibody-mediated immune response. Instead, it fully relies on innate immune mechanisms, such as the inducible synthesis of antimicrobial peptides, and the coagulation and melanization cascades (6Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.-M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 309-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Richman A. Kafatos F.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 8: 14-19Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ongoing exploration of immune mechanisms in A. gambiae is hampered by the small size of this insect, limited knowledge of its genetics, and the absence of an efficient method for germline transformation. Insect cell lines were previously shown to exhibit immune properties, including the inducible synthesis of antibacterial peptides (8Komano H. Kasama E. Nakanishi Y. Matsuyama K. Ando K. Nagasawa Y.

Hyg. 1994; 50: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have taken the approach of establishing A. gambiae cell lines as an in vitro system to analyze the immune mechanisms of the mosquito. We have reported that one such line expresses in an inducible manner a panel of immune marker genes (11Dimopoulos G. Richman A. Müller H.-M. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11508-11513Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In the course of establishing a larger variety of immune-responsiveA. gambiae cell lines, we identified some that secrete prophenoloxidase (PPO)1 in the culture medium and adopted one such line, 4a-3B, as a standard. No continuous cell lines of this type have been reported previously in any insect. Phenoloxidases (POs) are enzymes that serve multiple tasks in insects, including cuticle pigmentation and sclerotization, wound healing and the melanotic encapsulation of protozoan (plasmodia) and metazoan (filaria) pathogens (12Ashida M. Yamazaki H.I. Ohnishi E. Ishizaki H. Molting and Metamorphosis. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo1990: 239-265Google Scholar, 13Vernick K.D. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 261-309Google Scholar). The PPO zymogens are known to be synthesized in hemocytes, the cellular component of the insect immune defense, and are activated by trypsin-like serine protease components of the PPO activation system, also called the phenoloxidase cascade (see under “Discussion”). The PO cascade is inducible in vitro by microbial cell wall constituents and is considered part of the insect non-self recognition system (14Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D.

PO catalyzes the hydroxylation of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine and the oxidation of dihydroxyphenylalanine and dopamine to their respective quinones, mediators of protein cross-linking, and precursors of the melanin polymer that is a central component of the melanotic capsule (16Nappi A.J.

Pathak J.P.N. Insect Immunity. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1993: 131-148Crossref Google Scholar). Molecular cloning has yielded 12 PPO sequences to date, 1 crustacean, 6 lepidopteran, and 5 from diptera. All the sequences are closely related and show homology to hemocyanin, the arthropod oxygen transporter, which is functionally replaced in insects by the tracheal system. Using degenerate oligonucleotides and cDNA from the PPO producingA. gambiae cell lines as template, we amplified a PCR product consisting of a mixture of six distinct PO sequences. Three of these corresponded to PPO genes found in studies then in press (18Jiang H. Wang Y. Korochkina S.E. Benes H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,19Lee W.-J. Ahmed A. della Torre A. Kobayashi A. Ashida M. Brey P.T. Insect Mol. Biol. 1998; 7: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); the other three were novel and were designated PPO4, PPO5, and PPO6. Corresponding full-length cDNA clones were isolated and their sequences were determined. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) expression analysis using specific primer pairs confirmed that all six PPO genes are expressed constitutively in the same cell line but show distinct expression profiles during mosquito development. Transcription of the genes that are larva-specific is transiently up-regulated in the adult female mosquito following a blood meal. The same genes are up-regulated when our standard cell line is exposed to 20-HOE. Interestingly, the only adult-specific PPO gene, PPO5, shows a converse behavior: it is repressed upon a blood meal in the mosquito and upon 20-HOE treatment of the cell line. Thus, this cell line is a useful in vitro model for the study of hormone-regulated as well as immune-regulated gene expression, phenomena that are frequently connected in insects. The A. gambiae strains 4a r/r, L3–5, and Suakoko 2La were maintained at 27 °C and 75% relative humidity on a 12-h light-dark cycle. Larvae were kept in deionized water supplemented with 0.1% marine salt and fed with dry cat food. Adult mosquitoes had access to 20% sucrose solution ad libidum and were blood-fed on a volunteer's arm (H.-M. M.). Schneider medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS, 20 mm EGTA, and 10 mm thiourea was used to perfuse 1-day-old female 4a r/r mosquitoes. No further protease inhibitors were added, as FCS alone was found to be an efficient inhibitor of the PO cascade otherwise triggered by exposure of the hemolymph to air (blackening). Mosquitoes were chilled on ice and transferred on a 8-well glass slide containing 5 μl of perfusion medium per well, and a cut was made at the second-to-last abdominal segment. A fine glass needle containing 5 μl was inserted in the neck, and the perfusion medium, injected by air pressure, was collected in the well. Cells were allowed to settle for 2 min, and then 10 μl of 4% formaldehyde in PBS (130 mm NaCl, 7 mmNa2HPO4, 3 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) were added. After 20 min of fixation at ambient temperature, samples were processed as described below for immunofluorescence. Pupae or decapitated female mosquitoes of the 4a r/r strain were placed in a drop of 5-μl PBS containing 2 mg/ml of the serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim) and 20 mm EGTA. After cutting apart thorax and abdomen, the body parts and the fluid were transferred in a vial containing 100 μl of the same buffer, prechilled on ice. After the dissection of 10 animals, thoraces and abdomens were gently vortexed. The fluid phase was recovered and mixed with an equal volume of 2-fold concentrated reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and stored at −20 °C. Cell lines were established according to the method of Pudney et al. (20Pudney M. Varma M.G.R. Leake C.J. Tissue Culture Association Manual. 1979; 5: 997-1003Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) using neonate A. gambiae larvae as starting material. Repeated agitation starting 36 h after egg deposition led to synchronous hatching 6–7 h later; only larvae hatched within 1 h were used for primary cultures. Large scale primary cultures were set up in 50-ml tissue culture flasks (Falcon 3014) in a volume of 5 ml using about 1000–3000 larvae, each cut, on average, in 3–4 pieces, followed by a trypsin treatment (20Pudney M. Varma M.G.R. Leake C.J. Tissue Culture Association Manual. 1979; 5: 997-1003Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Two alternative media were used, Schneider medium (Sigma) or MK/VP-medium (20Pudney M. Varma M.G.R. Leake C.J. Tissue Culture Association Manual. 1979; 5: 997-1003Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FCS, penicillin-streptomycin (300 units/ml-300 μg/ml), gentamycin (100 μg/ml), and Fungizone (2.5 μg/ml); the cultures were kept at 27 °C. Once per week, half of the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 20% FCS and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml-100 μg/ml). After subculture 10, the FCS content in the medium was gradually decreased to 10%. All the lines are kept continuously in Schneider medium. Cells were seeded in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Greiner) containing 25 ml of Schneider medium/10% FCS. After having reached half confluency, cell layers were rinsed several times with protein-free medium (Insect-Xpress, BioWhittaker), 15 ml of protein-free medium was added, and cultures were grown for 2 more weeks at 27 °C. Cell growth was retarded in Insect-Xpress medium, although without any sign of deterioration of the cells. The conditioned medium was transferred in a dialysis bag and 5-fold concentrated on polyethylene glycol-35,000 powder. After dialysis against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, preparations were stored at −20 °C. Cell cultures were immune-stimulated by adding to a confluent culture for 4 h a mixture of heat-inactivatedEscherichia coli 1106 and Micrococcus luteus A270, 1000 bacteria per mosquito cell. 20-Hydroxyecdysone (Sigma) in ethanol was added yielding a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml (1 μm), with the ethanol concentration below 0.1%. For the wash-out experiment, 20-HOE-containing medium was aspirated, and cell layers were rinsed several times with Schneider medium before conditioned 20-HOE-free medium, taken from a culture of identical age, was added. Unless otherwise indicated, all molecular techniques were performed as described (21Perbal B. A Practical Guide to Molecular Cloning. Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar). Total RNA from cell lines and the various mosquito developmental stages was purified using the RNaid PLUS kit (bio101) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase and supplied solutions (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 2 μg total RNA in a reaction volume of 15 μl. cDNA synthesis was primed using the equivalent of 3 μl of oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads (Dynal), washed with distilled water before use. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h with occasional suspension, reactions were terminated by heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Beads were rinsed several times and resuspended in 200 μl of distilled water. 1.5 μl of bead suspension was used in 20-μl PCRs containing 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 200 μm dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.05 μl of each [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP (10 μCi/μl, 3000 Ci/mmol), 0.5 units Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), and 20 pmol of each primer. PCRs were performed in a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler (GeneAmp 9600), 1 min at 63 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and 1 min at 94 °C per cycle. Cycle numbers are indicated in the figure legends. 4 μl of each PCR were subjected to electrophoresis on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were exposed on Kodak X-Omat AR films with Ilford Fast Tungstate screens. The ribosomal gene S7 (22Salazar C.E. Mills-Hamm D. Kumar V. Collins F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) served as internal control and was used for normalization as follows: the S7 signals resulting from the initial PCRs of a given set of cDNA samples were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), the S7 values were equalized, and the template amounts were adjusted accordingly. The S7 signals obtained from the second round of PCRs were again quantified by phosphorimaging and normalized against S7 in order to fine-tune the amount of sample loaded on the final gel, resulting in deviations between any S7 signal in a given experiment of no more than ±5%. The sequences of the primers used in RT-PCR experiments were as follows: S7-A, 5′-GGCGATCATCATCTACGT-3′; S7-B, 5′-GTAGCTGCTGCAAACTTCGG-3′. Def-A, 5′-CTGTGCCTTCCTAGAGCAT-3′; Def-B, 5′-CACACCCTCTTCCCAGGAT-3′. GNBP-A, 5′-GCAACGAGAATCTGTACC-3′; GNBP-B, 5′-TAACCACCAGCAACGAGG-3′. PO1-A, 5′-TTCGATGCCTCTAACCGGGCGA-3′; PO1-B, 5′-GCGGGATGCGGTTACCGGATTCA-3′. PO2-A, 5′-CGGTTCTGCGCCAAGCTGAAGAA-3′; PO2-B, 5′-CTGCCATACAGCTGGGCATTCGG-3′. PO3-C, 5′-GGGTCCCGACCGTGTCGTCAAC-3′; PO3-D, 5′-ACGATTACCACCGGGGCCCACG-3′. PO4-C, 5′-CGCGGGCCGGATCGTATCGTGC-3′; PO4-E, 5′-CTCAACTCGTTTAAGATCACTCAA-3′. PO5-C, 5′-ACTGGTCCGGATCGGGTTGTGC-3′; PO5-D, 5′-GAACACGATCGCCATTCGTCGC-3′. PO6-A, 5′-GGCGAGGGTCCGAATAACGTA-3′; PO6-B, 5′-TCCGATTTCCTCCGGGGGCAACA-3′. The resulting lengths of the corresponding PCR products were as follows: S7, 460 bp; defensin, 404 bp; GN BP, 511 bp; PPO1, 358 bp; PPO2, 344 bp; PPO3, 343 bp; PPO4, 246 bp; PPO5, 346 bp; and PPO6, 349 bp. Except for PPO2, the primer combinations denoted above do not work on genomic DNA, e.g. on bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), as the polymorphic sequence block chosen for the design of the antisense primers turned out to span an intron/exon border that occurs in PPO1, 2P. Brey, personal communication. which is obviously conserved in all PPO genes except PPO2. Two lambda ZAP cDNA libraries were screened, one was constructed using mRNA isolated from fourth instar larvae of A. gambiae G3 (23Barillas-Mury C. Charlesworth A. Gross I. Richman A. Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4961Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and one using mRNA isolated from abdomens of adult female A. gambiae Suakoko 2La mosquitoes (24Dimopoulos G. Seeley D. Wolf A. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6115-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Both libraries were constructed using the ZAP Express system (Stratagene). As probe, the gel-purified PCR product amplified from cDNA of cell line 4a-3B using the primers PO-CuA and PO-CuB was enriched with gel-purified PPO4, PPO5, and PPO6 fragments and 32P-labeled via PCR. From a total of 700,000 plaques screened, 200,000 larval and 500,000 abdominal, approximately 60 positive signals were obtained in each library. Before starting the plaque purification procedure, the supernatants of the positive phage plaque zones of the primary screen were PCR-typed using the set of six specific PPO primer pairs. The identified PPO4, PPO5, and PPO6 samples were plaque purified via hybridization, followed by PCR typing. The 0.6-kb PCR product amplified from cell line cDNA using the degenerate primers PO-CuA (5′-CAICA(TC)TGGCA(TC)TGGCA(TC)CTIGT(GATC)TA(TC)CC-3′) and PO-CuB (5′-CITGCCAICG(AG)TA(AG)AAIA(ACT)(CG)GG(AG)TCIC(TG)CAT-3′) (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, 25 cycles) was gel-purified and cloned using the TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid clones containing PPO cDNA inserts were obtained from the purified lambda ZAP phage clones using the in vivo excision method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The sequences of the cloned insertions were determined by the EMBL sequencing facility. The RGD sequence in PPO6 was confirmed by sequencing the corresponding region of four independent cDNA clones; in PPO4 and PPO5, the corresponding region of a second cDNA clone was sequenced. Hybridizations were essentially performed as described (25Kumar V. Collins F.H. Insect Mol. Biol. 1994; 3: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), using semi-gravid female mosquitoes of the Suakoko 2La strain, during the second gonotrophic cycle. DNA of whole BACs that were shown by PCR typing to contain PPO3 and PPO6(BAC clone 27E19) or PPO4 and PPO5 (BAC clone 28C11) were used for in situ hybridization. In addition,in situ hybridizations were carried out using gel-purified insertions of cDNA clones corresponding to PPO4,PPO5, and PPO6. The TA-plasmid vectors (Invitrogen) containing the PCR fragments amplified by the degenerate oligonucleotides PO-CuA and PO-CuB wereEcoRI-digested, and the PO inserts were subcloned in theEcoRI site of the polylinker of the modified expression vector pDS56/RBSII,6xHis/E−(-2) (26Müller H.-M. Catteruccia F. Vizioli J. della Torre A. Crisanti A. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), resulting in a fusion of six histidine residues at the amino termini. Expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli and purification by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography was performed as described previously (27Stüber D. Matile H. Garotta G. Lefkovits I. Pernis B. Immunology Methods. 4. Academic Press Inc., Orlando, FL1990: 121-152Google Scholar). The purified PO proteins were insoluble and were stored at −20 °C in 8 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Two male rats were immunized with each construct using 100 μg of purified protein and the Ribi Adjuvant System following the manufacturer's instructions (RIBI ImmunoChem Research). Rats were bled 1 week after the fourth booster injection. Polypeptides contained in mosquito hemolymph or in protein-free medium (Insect-Xpress, BioWhittaker) conditioned by the growth of cell lines 4a-3A and 4a-3B were separated on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Immunoblots on nitrocellulose filters (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell) were performed as described previously (26Müller H.-M. Catteruccia F. Vizioli J. della Torre A. Crisanti A. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The anti-PPO6 serum dilution used was 1:1000; bound antibodies were detected by goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega). 4a-3A and 4a-3B cells were seeded on round glass coverslips placed in 24-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) yielding half confluent cell layers. After 3 days of growth at 27 °C the Schneider medium was removed, and the coverslips were washed once with PBS and then fixed in PBS/4% formaldehyde for 20 min. After fixative removal followed by one PBS wash, cells were exposed for 2 min to 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and then washed twice with PBS. Coverslips were blocked for 2 h with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PPO4 serum or preimmune serum diluted 1:500 in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. After three PBS washes, samples were incubated for 1 h with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (The Jackson Laboratory) diluted 1:300 in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. After the first PBS wash, nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Boehringer Mannheim) diluted 1:15,000 in PBS for 5 min, and three further PBS washes followed before mounting. In a previous report, we described the cell line Sua1B, which has immune-responsive properties, such as inducible expression of the antibacterial peptide defensin (11Dimopoulos G. Richman A. Müller H.-M. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11508-11513Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In a further effort to establish A. gambiae cell lines with novel properties, primary cultures were set up starting from neonate larvae of threeA. gambiae strains, Suakoko 2La, 4a r/r, and L3–5. Further variation was brought in by differing culture conditions,e.g. initial seeding density, medium, and splitting strategy. Some primary cultures gave rise to cell lines that developed relatively slowly and were finally identified serendipitously as PPO producers, when we observed spontaneous blackening of stored culture supernatants. Such lines were most frequently derived from the 4a r/r strain. The presence of PPO in the culture supernatant could be monitored directly by artificial activation on nitrocellulose (28Brey P.T. Stoltz D.B. Cook D.I. Ashida M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This rather simple test enabled us to follow PPO expression in all the lines during increasing subculture number. Whereas some primary cultures gradually lost the ability to produce PPO during establishment of the line, probably due to overgrowth by non-PPO producing fast growing cell types, others manifested the PPO phenotype stable, over 2 years (subculture > 60), until submission of this study for publication. We have chosen cell line 4a-3B as an example for our stable PPO producing cell lines and cell line 4a-3A as a PPO-negative control. These lines were derived from two primary cultures initiated from a single batch of minced neonate larvae of the A. gambiae strain 4a r/r. Both lines show inducible expression of certain immune markers (see below). To verify the expression of PPO on the molecular level, we PCR-amplified RNA sequences from several PPO-positive lines using degenerate oligonucleotides designed according to two conserved sequence blocks within the PO copper binding sites CuA (HHWHWHLVYP) and CuB (MRDP(F/V/I)FYRWH), respectively (Fig. 1) (29Hall M. Scott T. Sugumaran M. Söderhäll K. Law J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7764-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A PCR product of the expected size (approximately 600 bp) was obtained and cloned. Among 13 sequenced clones, we identified six distinct PPO sequences, which are different enough to represent distinct genes rather than polymorphism (see below). Subsequently, we designed primer pairs specific for each of the six PPO sequences (see under “Experimental Procedures”); analysis of 20 additional PCR-derived PPO clones with these specific primer pairs did not yield any evidence of an additional PPO gene: for every clone tested, one (and only one) of the six PPO primer pairs amplified a fragment of the expected size, thus confirming that the gene-specific primer pairs are diagnostic. All six PPOs were expressed in each of the six independent PPO-positive cell lines analyzed. 3H.-M. Müller, unpublished data. Three of the sequences matched the PPO1 gene published by Lee et al. (19Lee W.-J. Ahmed A. della Torre A. Kobayashi A. Ashida M. Brey P.T. Insect Mol. Biol. 1998; 7: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the PPO2 (formerly PPO-p1) andPPO3 (formerly PPO-p2) sequences published by Jiang et al. (18Jiang H. Wang Y. Korochkina S.E. Benes H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the three other PPO genes were novel and were named PPO4, PPO5, and PPO6. The mixed PCR products generated by the degenerate primers were enriched with these novel sequences, and were used as probe to screen two A. gambiae cDNA phage libraries: one constructed with mRNA of whole fourth instar larvae (23Barillas-Mury C. Charlesworth A. Gross I. Richman A. Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4961Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and one with mRNA purified from abdomens of female mosquitoes (24Dimopoulos G. Seeley D. Wolf A. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6115-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The screening yielded approximately 60 positive signals from each of the two libraries, and rescreening of a subset of the positives, using the six PPO gene-specific primer pairs, identified PPO clones that were evidently differentially represented: from the adult library 10 PPO5, 5 PPO6, and 1 PPO2 clone were identified, whereas from the larval library, 5 PPO2 and 4 PPO3 clones were identified. The original 120 positives were rescreened with the PPO4-specific primers, leading to the identification of four PPO4 clones from the larval and one from the adult library. At least three full-length cDNA clones were characterized for each of the novel PPO genes PPO4, PPO5, and PPO6. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequences of PPO4,PPO5, and PPO6 as deduced from their cDNA sequences, aligned with those of the previously identified A. gambiae PPO genes PPO1, PPO2, andPPO3. Like all the arthropod PPO sequences published so far, the mosquito PPOs do not encode a potential signal peptide sequence. An arginine-phenylalanine zymogen cleavage site (Fig. 1, vertical arrow) that has been experimentally determined in Bombyx mori (30Kawabata T. Yasuhara Y. Ochiai M. Matsuura S. Ashida M. Proc. Natl.

Cleavage sites at similar positions were determined experimentally in H. diomphalia PPO (31Lee S.Y. Kwon T.H. Hyun J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J.

We have cloned and characterized a new human cDNA, HDAC-A, with homology to the yeast HDA1 family of histone deacetylases. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of HDAC-A revealed an open reading frame of 967 amino acids containing two domains: a NH2-terminal domain with no homology to known proteins and a COOH-terminal domain with homology to known histone deacetylases (42% similarity to RPD3, 60% similarity to HDA1).

Grunstein M. Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 12Kadosh D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 13Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), these results established that chromatin is not only a structural scaffold responsible for DNA compaction in the eukaryotic nucleus but is also an active and dynamic participant in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. This model has been recently validated by the demonstration that the enzymatic activity of the yeast histone acetyltransferase GCN5 is necessary for the transactivational activity of this factor (14Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutation of amino acids critical for the histone deacetylase activity of RPD3 or HDAC1 reduced partially or totally their repressor activity (16Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 17Kadosh D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the involvement of histone acetylation in transcriptional regulation has come from studies with fungal toxins, such as trichostatin A and trapoxin, that specifically inhibit histone deacetylases. These inhibitors shift the dynamic equilibrium between histone acetylation and deacetylation toward the hyperacetylated state (18Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Several reports established a correlation between hyperacetylation of histones and transcriptional activation; for example, both trichostatin A and trapoxin increase the transcriptional activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter in vivo and in vitro (19Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 20Sheridan P.L. Mayall T.P. Verdin E. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3327-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, other studies have shown that histone deacetylases can also play a significant role in transcriptional silencing. In mammalian cells, inhibition of histone deacetylases by trichostatin A or trapoxin activates or represses a small fraction of cellular genes (21Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Exp. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar) and disruption of RPD3 and SIN3 in S. cerevisiae showed that both genes are required to fully activate or repress specific promoters (22Kadosh D.

The histone deacetylases identified can be grouped into three families:S. cerevisiae RPD3 and RPD3-related proteins in higher organisms, such as HDAC1, 2, and 3 (9Taunton J. Hassig C.A.

Science. 1997; 277: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which presents no homology to the other two families. Biochemical and molecular biological studies in different systems have established that histone deacetylases are components of large multiprotein complexes that are targeted to promoter sites through their interaction with sequence-specific transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 32Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar and33Wolffe A.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 16-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the identification and cloning of a human cDNA with a region of homology to yeast HDA1. The protein encoded by this cDNA, HDAC-Ap, exhibits a catalytically active histone deacetylase domain in vivo. We also identified three additional human sequences with strong homology to HDAC-A that represent additional members of this new family of human histone deacetylases. 293 cells were grown in Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. HeLa cells were cultured on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum using the same supplementations. Trichostatin A was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, stored at 10 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide at −20 °C, and diluted immediately before use. A human brain cDNA library was constructed by reverse transcription of human whole brain poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) with reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II, Life Technologies) and a (dT)15 primer carrying the NotI site at the 5′ extremity (5′-pGACTAGTTCTAGATCGCGAGCGGCCGCCC(T)15–3′) according to the supplier's instructions (34Ohara O. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). After ligation of the SalI adaptor and NotI digestion, the resulting cDNAs were separated on 1% low melting point agarose gels, and cDNA fragments bigger than 9 kb1 were recovered. These cDNA fragments were then ligated with theSalI/NotI-digested pSPORT1 vector and introduced into Eschericia coli cells by electroporation (ElectroMax DH10B cells, Life Technologies). Plasmids were extracted from about 10,000 independent ampicillin-resistant colonies grown on agar plates by the standard alkaline/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) method. The isolated plasmids were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and those corresponding to the original fractionated size were retrieved. Clones were randomly selected for dideoxy sequencing with ABI PRISM cycle sequencing and ABI sequencers (Model 373A or 377 DNA, Perkin-Elmer). Multiple human tissue Northern blots and RNA master blots were obtained from CLONTECH. A32P-labeled probe corresponding to the HDAC-A cDNA was prepared with the Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing of blots were performed using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) under high-stringency conditions according to standard methods (35Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Membranes were also hybridized to a probe corresponding to the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA to control for the relative amount of mRNA loaded in each lane. Relative expression levels were quantitated with a FUJIX BAS1000 PhosphorImager system and Mac Bas software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). To generate COOH-terminal epitope-tagged constructs of different histone deacetylases, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with a reverse primer containing the sequence for the FLAG peptide. First the following two primers were used to amplify HDAC3: forward, 5′-CCGGATCCGAATTCACCATGGCCAAGACCGTGGCC-3′; backward, 5′-GCTCTAGA TTA CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTCCTCCGAATTCAATCTCCACATCGCTTTCC-3′, (restriction sites are underlined; the sequence encoding the FLAG epitope is italic, and the stop codon is bold). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XbaI and inserted into corresponding sites of the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) using standard protocols (35Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). The region coding for HDAC3 was then replaced with PCR fragments encoding each of the other histone deacetylases by subcloning into new EcoRI sites that had been engineered into the PCR primers. The following oligonucleotides were used for PCR amplification: HDAC1 forward, 5′-CGGAATTCACGATGGCGCAGACGCAGGGCAC-3′, backward, 5′-CGGAATTCGGCCAACTTGACCTCCTCCTTG-3′; murine HDAC2 (a gift from Dr. Ed Seto) forward, 5′-CGGAATTCACCATGGCGTACAGTCAAGGAG-3′, backward, 5′-CGGAATTCAGGGTTGCTGAGTTGTTCTG-3′; HDAC-A forward, 5′-CGGAATTCCAGGAGATGCTGGCCATGAAG-3′, backward, 5′-CGGAATTCCAGGGGCGGCTCCTCTTC-3′; HDAC-A1–544 forward, 5′-CGGAATTCACCATGCTGGCCATGAAGCACC-3′, backward, 5′-CGGAATTCCAGCGTGTCATACACGAGGCC-3′; HDAC-A495–967 forward, 5′-CGGAATTCACCATGGAGGCCGCCGGCATC-3′; HDAC-A544–967 forward, 5′-CGGAATTCACCATGCTGAAGCACCAGTGCACC-3′. HeLa cells growing on coverslips were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). After 48–72 h, cells were fixed with 1.0% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and stained as described (37Hendzel M. Kruhlak M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2491-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The primary antibody, anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Imaging was done on a Leica DM-R epifluorescence microscope with a 100 × or a 63 × 1.4 N.A. PlanApo lens. Images were collected digitally with a cooled 12-bit CCD (Princeton MicroMax). Digital deconvolution was performed as described previously (37Hendzel M. Kruhlak M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2491-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 293 cells (5 × 107 cells) were transfected with LipofectAMINE. After 36 h, the cells were harvested and lysed in low stringency lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim). Protein concentrations of extracts were normalized with a modified Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). To control for expression of different constructs, Western blot analysis was performed with the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (Amersham) as described (28Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Protein G–Sepharose was preincubated with bovine serum albumin at 10 mg/ml to reduce nonspecific binding, and extracts were precleared for immunoprecipitation as described (28Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated by incubation with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at 10 mg/ml overnight at 4 °C. As a control, immunoprecipitations were also performed with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody after a 2-h preincubation at room temperature with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the FLAG epitope (100-fold molar excess). Immune complexes were recovered by adding 20 μl of the preblocked 50% protein G–Sepharose slurry for 4 h at 4 °C and washing three times with low stringency lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and twice with histone deacetylase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). For inhibition studies, the immunoprecipitated complexes were preincubated with trichostatin A (400 nm) in histone deacetylase buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were resuspended in 30 μl of histone deacetylase buffer containing 20,000 cpm of an acetylated H4 peptide. Histone deacetylase activity was determined after incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, as described (28Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, 293 cells (2 × 107) were metabolically labeled with [35S]EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mixture (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Cells were starved by a 20-min incubation in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies). Labeling was done in methionine- and cysteine-free 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing 0.15 mCi/ml radiolabeled amino acids ([35S]Met, [35S]Cys). Cells were harvested after 16 h and lysed as described above. Lysates were divided after preclearing and immunoprecipitated with M2 antibody or preblocked M2 antibody (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose slurry (50%, 20 μl) was added for 1 h at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitates were washed three times with low stringency lysis buffer, three times with the same buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and once with phosphate-buffered saline. Immune complexes were eluted from the beads with phosphate-buffered saline, containing 1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and analyzed by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed, enhanced with Amplify (Amersham), dried, and exposed for autoradiography. A cloning strategy was developed to identify new long cDNAs (34Ohara O. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Random sequencing of a size-selected (>9 kb) human brain cDNA library identified a new cDNA encoding a putative protein with striking homology to a yeast histone deacetylase, HDA1 (see Fig. 1,A and B). Sequence analysis of this cDNA, referred to as HDAC-A hereafter, revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 2,901 base pairs encoding a putative protein of 967 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). This ORF is preceded by a 1134-nucleotide untranslated 5′ region and followed by a 4415-nucleotide untranslated domain. The molecular mass of the derived protein is 105 kDa, and the calculated isoelectric point is 6.7. A stop codon (TAA) is located in-frame immediately upstream of the presumed start codon. Although, several potential initiation sites are located in the 5′-untranslated region upstream of the putative translation initiation site (data not shown), the resulting ORFs are probably too short to yield a proteinin vivo. Since the deduced ORF encodes a functional protein, this mRNA belongs to a growing number of transcripts that do not use the first ATG codon to initiate translation (38Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar).Figure 1HDAC-A encodes a putative new histone deacetylase. A, the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence corresponding to the longest ORF representing HDAC-A are shown. An upstream stop codon (TAA) immediately ahead of the start codon is underlined. The presumed start codon (ATG) is indicated by a box. Two other ATG codons that were used to generate NH2-terminal truncations at amino acid positions, 495 and 545, are also indicated by a box. Residues conserved within different histone deacetylases and critical for enzymatic activity, as derived from Prodom Release 36, are highlighted (box, absolutely conserved; circle, very conserved; underline, histone deacetylase core region).B, alignment of the HDAC-A, NY-CO-9 (HDAC-B), HDA1, and RPD3 proteins. The sequence of NY-CO-9 is not complete. Proteins were aligned with PIMA (version 1.4) and printed with BOXSHADE (version 3.21). Identical residues are in black; conserved residues are in gray. C, schematic representations of HDAC-A, NY-CO-9 (HDAC-B), HDA1, and RPD3 are aligned. Homology values referring to HDAC-A for two different domains, NH2- and COOH-terminal, are given in percent. Different regions of each protein are indicated by the corresponding amino acid positions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Alignment of HDAC-Ap with other histone deacetylases, such as HDA1p and RPD3p, showed that HDAC-Ap contains two distinct domains. The COOH-terminal domain (amino acids 495–967) displayed homology to known histone deacetylases, whereas the NH2-terminal domain (amino acids 1–494) exhibited no homology to known proteins (Fig.1 B). Comparison of HDAC-Ap with HDA1p and RPD3p revealed a high degree of homology to HDA1p in the catalytical core region (43% identity and 60% similarity), whereas the homology to RPD3p in a similar region was significantly lower (25% identity and 43% homology) (Fig. 1 C). Using the BLAST and TBLASTN algorithms to search for other sequences with homology to HDAC-A, we identified another human cDNA, NY-CO-9. This cDNA was recently cloned as an autoantigen from serum from patients with colon cancer (39Scanlan M.J. Chen Y.T. Williamson B. Gure A.O. Stockert E. Gordan J.D. Türeci O. Sahin U. Pfreundschuh M. Old L.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA, which we propose to call HDAC-B showed high overall homology (58% identity, 67% similarity) to the HDAC-A protein, particularly in the conserved catalytic histone deacetylase domain. The cDNA clone described by Scanlan and co-workers (independently isolated by us –KIAA0600) is truncated at the 5′ and 3′ extremities in comparison to HDAC-A. However, the genomic sequence of HDAC-B was identified on chromosome 17 (Human Genome Project, GenBank accession no. AC004150) and regions corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ extremities of the HDAC-A ORF were found. Therefore, we expect the full-length HDAC-B protein to be similar in size to HDAC-A. Two additional genomic sequences located on human chromosomes 7p15-7p21 and 12q31, respectively, also showed high sequence similarity to HDAC-A (TableI). Expressed sequence tags corresponding to these genomic clones were identified (Table I), and it is therefore likely that these encode additional HDAC-A homologues. We propose to call these new cDNAs HDAC-C and HDAC-D.Table IHDAC-A belongs to a new family of human histone deacetylasesSynonymGenomic locationAccession no.Genomic sequencedbESTHDAC-AKIAA0288AB006626AA101045N27858AA3274322HDAC-BNY-CO-9Chr. 17AF039691AC004150AA194873KIAA0600AB011172AA116072H69274HDAC-CChr. 7p15-p21AC004994AA405905AC004744AA287983AC002410HDAC-DChr. 12q31AC004466W04418H09529N64095Human sequences with homology to HDAC-A were identified using BLAST and TBLASTN algorithms searching nonredundant nucleid acid data bases on the GenomNet WWW server (Human Genome Center, University of Tokyo).

Open table in a new tab Human sequences with homology to HDAC-A were identified using BLAST and TBLASTN algorithms searching nonredundant nucleid acid data bases on the GenomNet WWW server (Human Genome Center, University of Tokyo). Accession numbers for cDNA sequences, genomic sequences, and representative EST clones are given. Sequence alignment for genomic clones of HDAC-C and HDAC-D were performed and manually aligned by using the HDAC-A sequence as template. To explore the expression of HDAC-A in different tissues, we performed Northern blot analysis (Fig.2 A) with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to the HDAC-A cDNA. A single species of 8.4 kb was detected in all tissues examined except testis, where a smaller species of 3.4 kb was present as well. The size of this transcript is in good agreement with the size of the cloned cDNA (8459 nucleotides). A weaker band corresponding to 4.2 kb in many tissues examined might represent a degradation product of the HDAC-A mRNA. To compare HDAC-A expression in a wider array of tissues and to obtain more information on transcript abundance, we used normalized mRNA master dot blots (CLONTECH). Quantification of the dot blots showed that HDAC-A was highly expressed in skeletal muscle, thymus, and small intestine. Heart, colon, brain, ovary, peripheral blood leukocytes, prostate, pancreas, spleen, and lung showed intermediate expression, while liver, placenta, and kidney showed very low expression (Fig. 2 B). To examine the subcellular localization of the HDAC-A protein, HeLa cells were transfected with a HDAC-A-FLAG fusion construct, and indirect immunofluorescence was performed with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody, as described (37Hendzel M. Kruhlak M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2491-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HDAC-Ap was found predominantly in the interphase cell nucleus (Fig.3 A). As expected, HDAC-Ap shows diffuse localization during mitosis, when the nuclear compartment is disintegrated (bottom of Fig. 3 A1). In the interphase cell nucleus, HDAC-Ap is excluded from nucleoli and accumulates in discrete foci (Fig. 3 B). Similar chromatin-depleted foci have been reported for the localization of endogenous HDAC1p (37Hendzel M. Kruhlak M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2491-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Like HDAC1p, HDAC-Ap is depleted near the periphery of the cell nucleus and excluded from heterochromatic territories. To determine whether HDAC-Ap possesses intrinsic histone deacetylase activity, plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged fusion proteins were transfected into 293 cells. After transfection, a new protein of approximately 120 kDa was detected by Western blots with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.4 B). We used the anti-FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate HDAC-Ap and assayed for histone deacetylase activity with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal tail of histone H4 as a substrate (28Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Similar immunoprecipitations were performed after transfection of plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged versions of HDAC1, mHDAC2, and HDAC3 as controls. Material immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody in cells transfected with the HDAC-A–FLAG plasmid demonstrated histone deacetylase activity (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, immunoprecipitated material from cells transfected with the corresponding empty vector plasmid yielded no detectable histone deacetylase activity. No histone deacetylase activity was detected when immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-FLAG antibody preincubated with an excess of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the FLAG epitope. As reported for other histone deacetylases, the enzymatic activity of HDAC-Ap was inhibited by trichostatin A. These results demonstrate that HDAC-Ap is a functional enzyme with histone deacetylase activity in vivo. To map the catalytical domain of HDAC-A, we generated deletion constructs of HDAC-A either from the NH2 or COOH terminus guided by the homology to other histone deacetylases, especially HDA1 (Figs. 1 A and 5 A). A fragment corresponding to amino acids 495–967 of HDAC-Ap, the region homologous to HDA1p, exhibited significant histone deacetylase activity, which was reproducibly higher than the activity of the full-length protein (Fig.5 B). A fragment of HDAC-Ap corresponding to amino acids 545–967 exhibited no histone deacetylase activity, indicating that the short region between amino acids 495 and 545 is critical for enzymatic activity. As expected, the amino-terminal portion of HDAC-Ap, amino acids 1–544, had no histone deacetylase activity. The higher histone deacetylase activity of the fragment containing amino acids 495–967 in comparison to the full-length protein is consistent with the possibility that the amino-terminal region of HDAC-Ap"
https://openalex.org/W1991862371,"Group V phospholipase A2 is a recently discovered secretory phospholipase A2(PLA2) that has been shown to be involved in eicosanoid formation in inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and mast cells. We have demonstrated that human group V PLA2(hsPLA2-V) can bind phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes and hydrolyze PC substrates much more efficiently than human group IIa PLA2, which makes it better suited for acting on the outer plasma membrane (Han, S.-K., Yoon, E. T., and Cho, W. (1998)Biochem. J. 331, 353–357). In this study, we demonstrate that exogenous hsPLA2-V has much greater activity than does group IIa PLA2 to release fatty acids from various mammalian cells and to elicit leukotriene B4 formation from human neutrophils. To understand the molecular basis of these activities, we mutated two surface tryptophans of hsPLA2-V to alanine (W31A and W79A) and measured the effects of these mutations on the kinetic activity toward various substrates, on the binding affinity for vesicles and phospholipid-coated beads, on the penetration into phospholipid monolayers, and on the activity to release fatty acids and elicit eicosanoid formation from various mammalian cells. These studies show that the relatively high ability of hsPLA2-V to induce cellular eicosanoid formation derives from its high affinity for PC membranes and that Trp31 on its putative interfacial binding surface plays an important role in its binding to PC vesicles and to the outer plasma membrane.

To understand the molecular basis of these activities, we mutated two surface tryptophans of hsPLA2-V to alanine (W31A and W79A) and measured the effects of these mutations on the kinetic activity toward various substrates, on the binding affinity for vesicles and phospholipid-coated beads, on the penetration into phospholipid monolayers, and on the activity to release fatty acids and elicit eicosanoid formation from various mammalian cells. These studies show that the relatively high ability of hsPLA2-V to induce cellular eicosanoid formation derives from its high affinity for PC membranes and that Trp31 on its putative interfacial binding surface plays an important role in its binding to PC vesicles and to the outer plasma membrane. 1,2-bis[12-(lipoyloxy)dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol phospholipase A2 secretory PLA2 human secretory class IIa PLA2 human secretory class V PLA2 cytosolic PLA2 1,2-dihexanoylthio-1,2-dideoxy-glycero-3-phosphosphocholine 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol leukotriene B4 phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylglycerol 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine Phospholipase A2s (PLA2)1 are a family of lipolytic enzymes that are found both intra- and extracellularly. Because PLA2-catalyzed liberation of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids leads to the production of potent inflammatory lipid mediators, eicosanoids that include prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and lipoxins, the elucidation of their regulatory mechanisms is important for understanding the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and for developing a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs. Mammalian tissues contain multiple forms of PLA2s (1Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), including groups I, IIa, IIc, V, X (2Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol.

Recent cell studies have indicated that both cPLA2 and sPLA2 are involved in eicosanoid production (3Bartoli F. Lin H.K. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Apitz-Castro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15625-15630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The critical involvement of cPLA2 was demonstrated by recent genetic studies showing that the disruption of the cPLA2gene results in loss of lipid mediator biosynthesis (6Bonventre J.V. Huang Z.

Group IIa sPLA2 has long been implicated in inflammation based on findings that it is synthesized and secreted by a variety of cells in response to inflammatory cytokines and that it is found in fluids from inflammatory exudation. However, group IIa sPLA2 has extremely low affinity for zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles (8Bayburt T. Yu B.Z. Lin H.K. Browning J. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Kim Y. Lichtenbergova L. Snitko Y. Cho W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear how this secreted protein might act on the extracellular face of plasma membrane of mammalian cells, which is composed largely of zwitterionic phospholipids, PC and sphingomyelin. More recently, group V sPLA2 has been shown to be involved in eicosanoid formation from murine macrophages and mast cells (10Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 11Reddy S.T. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13591-13596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of group V sPLA2 from different species showed that these enzymes, although homologous to group IIa sPLA2, have some notable variations in amino acid sequence (12Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2365-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In particular, they contain a few tryptophan residues, some of which are located on their putative interfacial binding surfaces (see Fig. 1), whereas group IIa sPLA2s have none. Those sPLA2s (e.g.cobra venom PLA2s) that show high activity toward PC vesicles and intact cell membranes typically have a number of tryptophans and other aromatic side chains on their interfacial binding surfaces; this finding suggests that group V sPLA2 might be better suited for acting on the outer cell membrane than group IIa sPLA2. Indeed, our recent study demonstrated that human group V sPLA2 (hsPLA2-V) could bind and hydrolyze PC vesicles much more effectively than human group IIa sPLA2 (hsPLA2-IIa) (14Han S.-K. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that hsPLA2-V also is much more active than hsPLA2-IIa in releasing fatty acids (including arachidonic acid) and in eliciting eicosanoid production from a variety of cells including neutrophils. This study also identifies a surface tryptophan residue (Trp31) of hsPLA2-V as a structural determinant of its high affinity for PC membranes and for outer cell membranes. 1-Hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (pyrene-PC), and -glycerol (pyrene-PG) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). 1,2-Bis(12-(lipoyloxy)-dodecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (BLPG) was prepared as described elsewhere (15Wu S.-K.

Porcine pancreatic PLA2 was obtained as a gift from Prof. M. K. Jain (University of Delaware). Mutagenesis was performed using the Sculptorin vitro mutagenesis kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and a phagemid DNA prepared from the pSK vector in the presence of helper phage R408 as described previously (23Han S.K.

Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified as described previously (14Han S.-K. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with some modifications. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used as a host for protein expression. An 8-liter Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin was inoculated with 80 ml of overnight culture from a single colony and was grown at 37 °C. When the absorbance of the medium at 600 nm reached 0.2, additional ampicillin was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and 0.5 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added when the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.8. After an additional 4 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and frozen at –20 °C. Cells were resuspended in 100 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.4% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate and stirred at 4 °C. The suspension was sonicated on ice using a Sonifier 450 (Branson) in pulse mode for 10 pulses of 15 s each. The inclusion body pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.8% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, sonicated as described above, and the suspension was centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of the same buffer solution and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The pellet was collected by centrifugation as described above and washed in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5m urea and 5 mm EDTA, and the suspension was centrifuged. The inclusion body protein was solubilized in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 8 m guanidinium chloride and 0.3 m sodium sulfite, and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 30 min. Eight ml of 2-nitro-5-(sulfothio)-benzoate solution (50 mm) was then added, and the modification was monitored spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. After the modification was complete (approximately 20 min), the mixture was further stirred for 20 min, and any insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 column (2.5 × 45 cm) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 m urea and 5 mmEDTA at room temperature, and the second major protein peak was collected (120 ml) and dialyzed against water and then against 0.3% (v/v) glacial acetic acid to precipitate the sulfonated protein. The precipitated protein was resuspended in 100 ml of deionized water, and the suspension was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mmEDTA and 5 m guanidinium chloride. The clear solution was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) attached to a fast protein liquid chromatography system at 4 °C (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The major protein peak was collected (ca 30 ml), and to this solution of sulfonated protein, 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 8 mm reduced glutathione and 7 mm oxidized glutathione, were added dropwise with stirring (120 rpm) over 3 h. The solution was kept at room temperature for 20 h, at which point, the protein solution was dialyzed at room temperature against 3 volumes of 4 liters of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2m guanidinium chloride and 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5. For wild type hsPLA2-V, the clear solution of folded protein was fractionally precipitated with 30–40% ammonium sulfate at room temperature. The resulting protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 5 ml of 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.2 m guanidinium chloride. The fractional precipitation of refolded hsPLA2-V by ammonium sulfate not only increased the purity of protein (>90% pure electrophoretically) but also allowed the concentration of protein solution (up to micromolar). For W31A and W78A, the refolded protein solution was dialyzed at room temperature against 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m guanidinium chloride, then against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and finally against distilled water. The dialyzed solution was lyophilized and the lyophilized powder was stored at –20 °C. The purity of wild type and mutant proteins assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was consistently higher than 90%. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as standard (Pierce). PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of polymerized mixed liposomes was carried out at 37 °C in 2 ml of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 μmpyrene-containing phospholipids (1 mol %) inserted in 9.9 μm BLPG, 2 μm bovine serum albumin, 0.16m NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2 (15Wu S.-K. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13902-13908Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Wu S.-K. Cho W. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The progress of hydrolysis was monitored as an increase in fluorescence emission at 378 nm using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrometer with the excitation wavelength set at 345 nm. Spectral bandwidth was set at 5 nm for both excitation and emission. Values ofk cat*/K m* were determined from reaction progress curves as described previously (22Snitko Y. Koduri R. Han S.-K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Enzymatic hydrolysis of DMPC and DMPM vesicles was monitored with the pH-stat method (24Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Sonicated small unilamellar vesicles of DMPM were prepared as described (24Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Sonicated small unilamellar DMPC vesicles were prepared by suspending 10 mg of lipid in 1 ml of water and sonicating as described (for about 10 min to give an almost clear suspension). The vesicles were annealed by incubating the solution at 50 °C for 90 min and then kept at 37 °C during use over 1 day. DMPM reaction mixtures contained 4 ml of 1 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 20 μg of polymyxin B sulfate, 240 μm DMPM at 21 °C and pH 8.0. DMPC reaction mixtures contained 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 77 mm DMPC in a volume of 4 ml at 25 °C and pH 8.0. Reactions were started by the addition of enzyme and monitored as the consumption of 3 mm NaOH titrant. Assays were calibrated to give nmol of product as described (24Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Assays with monomeric substrate racemic diC6thio-PC were carried out as described (17Yuan W. Quinn D.M. Sigler P.B. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6082-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To circumvent the complication due to low pelleting efficiency of PC vesicles, PC-coated styrene-divinylbenzene beads that can be rapidly and completely separated from the solution by low speed centrifugation were used (9Kim Y. Lichtenbergova L. Snitko Y. Cho W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phospholipid-coated beads were prepared as described previously (9Kim Y. Lichtenbergova L. Snitko Y. Cho W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phospholipid-coated beads were suspended in 3 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.16m NaCl and 0.1 mm EDTA (or 10 mmCaCl2; see under “Results”). Final bulk phospholipid concentration was 100–150 μm. Aliquots (20–140 μl) of bead suspension was incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the same buffer (total volume, 150 μl) containing 1 μm of bovine serum albumin and varying concentrations of PLA2. Controls contained the same mixtures minus phospholipid-coated beads. Mixtures were centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 × g, and aliquots of the supernatants were assayed for PLA2 activity using 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/POPG/1,2-sn-dioleoylglycerol (10:9:1 in mol ratio) mixture as a substrate as described (25Lichtenbergova L. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14128-14136Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Values of n and K d were determined by nonlinear least-squares analysis of the [E]b versus [E]o plot using the following equation, [E]b=Equation 1 [E]o+Kd+[PL]o/n−([E]o+Kd+[PL]o/n)2−4[E]o[PL]o/n2where [PL]o,[E]o, and [E]b are total phospholipid, total enzyme, and bound enzyme concentrations, respectively. This equation assumes that each enzyme binds independently to a site on the interface composed of nphospholipids with a dissociation constant of K d. For anionic PG, the binding was measured in the presence of 1 mm EDTA using both POPG-coated beads and sucrose-loaded POPG vesicles. The binding to sucrose-loaded POPG vesicles was measured as described previously (22Snitko Y. Koduri R. Han S.-K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Surface pressure (π) of monolayers was measured at room temperature using a du Nouy ring as described previously (26Shen Z. Wu S.-K. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11598-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). DHPC was spread onto the subphase (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.16 m NaCl, and 10 mm Ca2+) to form a monolayer with a given initial surface pressure (πo). Then, PLA2 was injected into the subphase and penetration was measured by monitoring the change in surface pressure (Δπ). At a given πo of phospholipid monolayer, the maximal Δ π value depended on the protein concentration in the subphase and reached a saturation when the protein concentration was above a certain value (approximately 1.5 μg/ml of hsPLA2-V at πo = 5 dyn/cm). Protein concentrations in the subphase were therefore maintained above such values to ensure that an observed Δπ value represents a maximum at a given πo. The analysis of monolayer penetration data obtained under this condition was described in detail previously (25Lichtenbergova L. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14128-14136Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fatty acid release from CHO-K1 and RAW 264.7 cells and from human peripheral blood neutrophils by exogenously added PLA2s was measured using a real-time fluorometric assay based on rat liver fatty acid-binding protein as described (28Koduri R. Baker S.F. Snitko Y. Han S.K. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32142-32153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Human neutrophils were prepared from heparinized venous blood collected from healthy medication-free donors by fractionation through centrifugation on Percoll solution for 20 min at 1000 × g, and remaining red blood cells were removed by hypotonic lysis as described previously (29DeChatelet L.R. Shirley P.S. Infect. Immun. 1982; 35: 206-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in 250 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing CaCl2 (1.2 mm) and increasing concentrations (1–100 nm) of hsPLA2-V, W31A, W79A, or hsPLA2-IIa. Control cells were treated with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Thereafter cells were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 2 min. Leukotriene levels were determined using a leukotriene B4 (LTB4) enzyme immunoassay kit from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Typically, LTB4secretion reached a maximal value within 30 min of incubation under this condition. The maximal value for each incubation mixture was then corrected for a background signal from control cells. hsPLA2-V has four tryptophan residues, of which at least two are solvent-exposed according to the model structure of hsPLA2-V, based on homology between it and hsPLA2-IIa (Fig. 1). To assess the contribution of surface tryptophan residues of hsPLA2-V to its unique ability to act on PC membranes, two surface tryptophans, Trp31 and Trp79, were mutated to Ala. Both mutants, W31A and W78A, were refolded more effectively than wild type, suggesting that these surface tryptophans might interfere with the in vitro refolding of recombinant hsPLA2-V. Enzymatic activities of wild type hsPLA2-V and the mutants were then rigorously compared using different types of substrates: monomers, anionic and zwitterionic vesicles, and polymerized mixed liposomes. We first measured initial velocities for hsPLA2-V-catalyzed hydrolysis of the soluble substrate racemic diC6thio-PC (see TableI). The substrate concentration, 0.5 mm, is well below the critical micelle concentration for this short-chain phospholipid (17Yuan W. Quinn D.M. Sigler P.B. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6082-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The turnover numbers for hsPLA2-V and its two mutants are comparable to that measured with N. n. naja PLA2, suggesting that the recombinant hsPLA2-V and mutants are correctly refolded. It is not clear whether hydrolysis of this substrate occurs via a truly monomeric enzyme-substrate complex or whether enzyme and substrate interact to form a enzyme-substrate microaggregate (30Rogers J. Yu B.Z. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6056-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Table IRate constants for in vitro hydrolysis of substrates by PLA2sEnzymediC6thio-PCDMPMDMPCPyrene-PC/BLPGPyrene-PG/BLPGkcat (s −1)10 6 × (kcat*/Km*)(m −1 s −1)hsPLA2-V0.33 ± 0.021.5 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.2aMeasured after the short lag phase (see Fig. 1).7 ± 27 ± 3W31A hsPLA2-V0.26 ± 0.021.1 ± 0.10.05 ± 0.012 ± 11.5 ± 0.3W79A hsPLA2-V0.34 ± 0.021.0 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.2aMeasured after the short lag phase (see Fig. 1).6 ± 26 ± 3hsPLA2-IIaNDbND, not determined.20 ± 6≈0.0003≈0.235 ± 10N. n. naja PLA20.54 ± 0.03NDNDNDNDTurnover numbers (k cat) for diC6thio-PC, DMPC, and DMPM were determined from initial velocities of hydrolysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Specificity constants (k cat*/K m*) for polymerized mixed liposomes were determined from the nonlinear least-squares analysis of reaction progress curves.a Measured after the short lag phase (see Fig. 1).b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Turnover numbers (k cat) for diC6thio-PC, DMPC, and DMPM were determined from initial velocities of hydrolysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Specificity constants (k cat*/K m*) for polymerized mixed liposomes were determined from the nonlinear least-squares analysis of reaction progress curves. The turnover numbers calculated from the initial velocities for the hydrolysis of anionic DMPM vesicles by hsPLA2-V, W31A and W79A, and hsPLA2-IIa are given in Table I. In these assays, the cationic cyclic peptide polymyxin B was included. This additive causes rapid intervesicle exchange of DMPM, which keeps the mole fraction of nonhydrolyzed DMPM in enzyme-containing vesicles near 1 so that the initial velocity can be easily measured (24Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The progress curves were linear for at least 15 min (not shown). The turnover number under these conditions for hsPLA2-V is 13-fold smaller than that for hsPLA2-IIa, and the mutation of Trp31and Trp79 to Ala has only a modest effect on the catalytic efficiency. When the concentration of DMPM was doubled from 240 to 480 μm, the initial velocities changed by <5%, which proves that all of the proteins are fully bound to vesicles. Thus, the differences in the turnover numbers reported in Table I reflect differences in the catalytic efficiencies of the enzymes at the vesicle interface. Fig. 2 shows the reaction progress curves for the hydrolysis of DMPC vesicles by PLA2s, and Table Igives the turnover numbers. As expected from earlier studies, hsPLA2-IIa showed very poor activity on zwitterionic vesicles, and this was due in part to poor binding to vesicles that lack negative charge (8Bayburt T. Yu B.Z. Lin H.K. Browning J. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Snitko Y. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The progress curve with porcine pancreatic PLA2 shows the classical lag phase, which is due in part to poor binding of enzyme to non-hydrolyzed vesicles and product-dependent binding of enzyme leading to rate acceleration (31Jain M.K. Berg O.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Even in the presence of 13.5 μg of porcine pancreatic PLA2, the initial rate was barely detectable, and then the velocity accelerated dramatically after about 10 min (Fig.2). Interestingly, wild type and W79A hsPLA2-V were highly active on DMPC vesicles, and only a very short lag was seen (Fig. 2). The turnover numbers for both proteins measured after the short lag were approximately 7000-fold larger than that for hsPLA2-IIa (Table I). This is in marked contrast to the results with DMPM vesicles, in which hsPLA2-IIa is the more active enzyme. Mutation of Trp31 to Ala reduced the turnover number by 44-fold. Thus, Trp31 seems to be a key residue for promoting high activity of hsPLA2-V on zwitterionic vesicles. We also measured the activity of hsPLA2-V and mutants on anionic polymerized mixed liposomes. In polymerized mixed liposome system, it is possible to accurately determine the head group specificity of PLA2 by varying the head group structure of hydrolyzable phospholipids in an inert polymerized matrix. Two phospholipids, pyrene-PC and pyrene-PG, were used as inserts in the BLPG polymerized matrix. As reported previously (14Han S.-K. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), hsPLA2-V has comparable activities on pyrene-PC and pyrene-PG, whereas hsPLA2-IIa has much lower activity o"

The PGRP is an essential component for peptidoglycan to trigger the prophenoloxidase cascade that is now recognized to be an important insect defense mechanism. We cloned cDNA encoding PGRP from the silkworm fat body cDNA library. Northern blot analysis showed that the PGRP gene is constitutively expressed in the fat body, epithelial cell, and hemocytes of naive silkworms. Furthermore, a bacterial challenge intensified the gene expression, with the maximal period being from 6 to 36 h after infection. The upstream sequence of the cloned PGRP gene was shown to contain putativecis-regulatory elements similar to the NF-κB-like element, interferon-response half-element, and GATA motif element, which have been found in the promoters of the acute phase protein genes of mammals and insects. A homology search revealed that the homologs of silkworm PGRP are present in mice, nematodes, and bacteriophages. This suggests that the recognition of peptidoglycan as foreign is effected in both vertebrates and invertebrates by PGRP homologs with an evolutionally common origin.

The common structures among pathogens are recognized to be non-selves in the immunity. This type of recognition is termed pattern recognition, as opposed to clonal recognition in which clonally selected immunoglobulins are employed (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 and peptidoglycan (PG) are the cell wall components of bacteria and β-1,3-glucan (βG) is that of fungi. They are recognized by pattern recognition proteins that are present in plasma as free-floating molecules or on the cell surface as receptors. Among the pattern recognition proteins in mammals, a humoral LPS-binding protein and the cellular receptor CD14 have been well characterized (2Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W.

In contrast, pattern recognition proteins for PG and βG have not been characterized as thoroughly as those for LPS, although CD14 is also implicated for the recognition of PG as non-self (6Gupta D.

Insect Biochem. 1988; 18: 323-330Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The latter two proteins are members of the prophenoloxidase cascade, of which other members are known to be serine protease zymogens and prophenoloxidase (20Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman and Hall, London1997: 135-172Google Scholar). They have been shown to have specific affinity to PG or βG and to work at initiation points of the cascade. The prophenoloxidase cascade is now recognized to be one of major insect defense mechanisms and to possibly play vital roles in interrelating the mechanisms and in recognizing of microbes as foreign. Thus, it is probable that PGRP and βGRP of the prophenoloxidase cascade are employed generally in insects as pattern recognition molecules for PG and βG. We previously reported the purification and the characterization of silkworm PGRP and βGRP (17Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 18Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pattern recognition proteins other than PGRP and βGRP are not known to be distributed among insects as widely as PGRP and βGRP. It is not clear whether pattern recognition proteins with the same specificity in mammals and in insects have any common structural similarity. However, parallels between cellular signaling pathways for the synthesis of mammalian acute phase proteins and insect immune proteins after a bacterial challenge have been revealed (21Hultmark D. Nature. 1994; 367: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This indicates a common origin of the pathways in innate immunity in mammals and insects Here, we report the cloning of PGRP cDNA from the fat body cDNA library and PGRP gene from the genomic library of the silkwormBombyx mori. The homology search showed that PGRP is a homologous protein to bacteriophage T7 lysozyme, although it does not have lysozyme activity, and that proteins homologous to PGRP are expressed in mammals. This experimental evidence suggests that recognition proteins for the initial extracellular non-self recognition in innate immunity of vertebrates and invertebrates have developed from a common origin. Our experimental results also show that PGRP synthesis is induced by a bacterial challenge and suggest that expression of the PGRP gene is regulated by the Rel family of transcription factors. Silkworms, B. mori (strain Kinshu × Showa), were reared on an artificial diet as described previously (22Yoshida H. Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 539-545Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The larvae on day 5 of the fifth instar were injected with 10 μl of late logarithmic phaseEnterobacter cloacae (JCM1232) suspension (A 600 = 0.1) in the physiological saline (10 mm bis-Tris propane buffer, pH 6.5, containing 150 mm NaCl) or with 10 μl of the saline as the control experiment. PGRP was purified as described by Yoshida et al. (17Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar).S-Pyridylethylated or intact PGRP was digested with trypsin at a molar ratio of enzyme to substrate of 1:50. The digestion was carried out in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, at 37 °C for 24 h, and the resulting peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a C8 column (4.6 × 150 mm, Vydac). The isolated peptides were sequenced using an automatic protein sequencer (Shimadzu PSQQ-10). The sequences of the peptides derived from S-pyridylethylated or intact PGRP were compared to determine the disulfide bond locations. A silkworm fat body cDNA library was constructed in the vector λZAP (Stratagene). Using internal peptide sequences, degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to KKQWDG and WPEWLE were synthesized. Their sequences were 5′-AAGAATTCAA(A/G)AA(A/G)CA(A/G)TGGGA(C/T)GG-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-AAGAATTCTC(A/C/G/T)A(A/G)CCA(C/T)TC(A/C/G/T)GGCCA-3′ (antisense primer), respectively. These primers were used for the polymerase chain reaction. The reaction was performed using the silkworm fat body cDNA library as a template under the following conditions: 35 cycles comprising 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. A 480-bp fragment was amplified, subcloned into a plasmid vector pBluescript (Stratagene), and sequenced using an automatic DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, model 377). The cloned polymerase chain reaction product labeled with [α-32P]dCTP was used to probe the λZAP fat body cDNA library. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 16 h in 2 × PIPES buffer (0.8 m NaCl, 40 mmPIPES, pH 6.5), 50% formamide, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membrane was washed twice in 0.1 × SSC (15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.2) at 53 °C for 15 min and subjected to autoradiography. Three positive clones were obtained and sequenced. The clone that had the longest insert and a complete open reading frame was used as PGRP cDNA clone. In the detection of PGRP transcript in naive silkworms, poly(A)+ RNA preparations from hemocytes, fat body, epidermal cells, midgut, silk gland, and malpighian tubules were prepared by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA of each preparation were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, transferred to a Hybond-N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) membrane, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled PGRP cDNA probe. The hybridization was performed for 16 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 4 × SSPE (1.2 m NaCl, 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 4 mm EDTA), 5 × Denhardt's (0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Ficoll), 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membrane was washed once in 2 × SSPE containing 0.1% SDS and subsequently twice in 1 × SSPE containing 0.1% SDS at 56 °C for 10 min. In the experiments to demonstrate the induction of PGRP gene in the fat body, total RNA from the fat body of silkworms was collected at intervals after the bacterial challenge. 20-μg aliquots of the RNA preparations were subjected to Northern blot analyses as above except that silkworm cecropin B (0.4 kbp) (23Kato Y. Taniai K. Hirochika H. Yamakawa M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and α-tubulin (1.3 kbp) probes were used in addition to the PGRP probe. The silkworm cecropin B (0.4 kbp) and α-tubulin (1.3 kbp) probes were obtained as polymerase chain reaction products, and the identities of their sequences to those having been reported were confirmed by referring to GenBankTM accession numbers S60579 and X83429, respectively. Silkworm genomic DNA was isolated from the silk gland using DNzol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 μg of the DNA were digested with EcoRI, BamHI, orSacI. DNA fragments in the digests were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel, blotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane, and hybridized with the32P-EcoRI/KpnI-digested cDNA. The digested cDNA probe (0.77 kbp) was the entire insert of PGRP cDNA clone with short flanking sequences. The conditions for the hybridization and the washings were the same as those in Northern blot analysis. 2 × 105plaques of an amplified B. mori genomic library constructed in λFIX (Stratagene) were screened with the 32P-labeled PGRP cDNA probe. Three positive plaques were isolated, and the λDNA was digested with BamHI or SacI. The32P-labeled PGRP cDNA probe hybridized with 2.5- and 4.3-kbp DNA fragments of BamHI digest and with a 2.1-kbp fragment of SacI digest. All the fragments were separately subcloned into pBluescript. After the deletion clones of the subclones were prepared, they were sequenced. Computer analysis of the sequencing data was performed using the GENETYX system (Software Development Co., LTD Tokyo). PGRP cDNA clones were obtained by screening a fat body cDNA library of the silkworm B. mori. The nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1. The open reading frame composed of nucleotides 31–618 encodes 196 amino acid residues. The first 23 amino acid residues seemed to be a signal peptide because the deduced amino acid sequence beginning from the 24th residue was identical to that observed previously at the N terminus of PGRP. Thus, the mature protein consists of 173 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 19290 Da. 49% of the deduced mature protein sequence, including the N-terminal, was confirmed to be identical to that determined by direct sequencing of peptides obtained after trypsin digestion of PGRP (Fig.1). Consensus sequence for N-glycosylation was not found in the deduced sequence. A polyadenylation consensus signal was not observed downstream of the stop codon. The cysteine residues engaged in the formation of the disulfide bond were determined to be Cys2-Cys124 and Cys38-Cys44 from a comparison of the results of peptide mapping and amino acid sequencing of reduced and nonreduced PGRP. Northern blot analysis using PGRP cDNA as a probe detected a 0.8-kbp transcript of PGRP in hemocytes, fat body, and epidermal cells but not in malpighian tubules, silk gland, and midgut of naive silkworms. This result indicates that PGRP mRNA is constitutively expressed in the fat body, epidermal cells, and hemocytes. Major sites for the synthesis of PGRP seemed to be the fat body and epidermal cells (Fig.2 A). The expression of PGRP gene and cecropin B gene in fat body was induced by injection of bacteria (E. cloacae) to silkworm larvae, as shown in Fig.2 B. The induction kinetics was similar in both genes: the induction was detected at 6 h and reached its maximum at 24 h after injection. When saline was injected instead of bacteria in the above Northern analysis, neither of the transcripts of PGRP and cecropin B genes increased in the fat body for 36 h after the injection (data not shown). These results indicated that the expression of PGRP gene is inducible by a bacterial challenge and that PGRP could be classified as an acute phase protein. We could detect the induction of PGRP gene expression in the fat body by the injection ofMicrococcus luteuspeptidoglycan. 2M. Ochiai, unpublished observation. We isolated three positive clones from the silkworm genomic library. The restriction maps of the three clones indicated that a 2.1-kbp SacI fragment overlaps both the 2.5- and 4.3-kbp BamHI fragments (Fig.3 B). Both of theBamHI fragments and the 2.1-kbp SacI fragment were subcloned separately into pBluescript. The sequences of these fragments were examined after subcloning the various restriction fragments. By comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the PGRP gene with that of the PGRP cDNA clone, the PGRP gene was revealed to contain four exons (exon I, nucleotides 1–100; exon II, 101–299; exon III, 300–418; and exon IV, 419–739 by nucleotide numbering of the PGRP cDNA clone in Fig. 1) interspersed with three introns. The 5′ end of exon I is putative because the starting point of transcription of the PGRP gene has not been studied. The 2.5-kbp BamHI fragment contained 1966 bp of 5′ upstream sequence of the initiating Met codon (Fig. 3 C). The TATA-box (TATATA) is located from nucleotide −73 to −68. Several putative cis-regulatory sequences were observed within −210 bp from the TATA-box. They were cAMP response motif (GTGACGTCAC), NF-kB-like motif (AGGGATTTCC), GATA motif (TGATAA), and five interferon response half-motifs (GAAANN) that have been found in promoter regions of many acute phase protein genes (24Engström Y. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman and Hall, London1997: 211-244Google Scholar). Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA digested with EcoRI,BamHI, or SacI were performed by using the PGRP cDNA probe. As is shown in Fig. 3 A, only one hybridized band was observed with the digest by EcoRI orBamHI, and the digest with SacI gave two hybridized bands (2.1 and 6.0 kbp). Because the cloned PGRP gene had one restriction site for each of BamHI and SacI, the digest with BamHI should have given two hybridization bands (2.1 kbp in addition to the observed 6.0 kbp). The reason we could not observe the 2.1-kbp fragment seems to be that the fragment contains only a short exon and the PGRP cDNA probe barely hybridized with the fragment. Thus, the results of the Southern blot analyses indicate the presence of a single copy of the PGRP gene in the silkworm genome. We searched for the existence of silkworm PGRP homologs in the data base sequences by BLAST and found that an expressed sequence tag from the lymphatic filarial nematodeBrugia malayi, and sequences of bacteriophage T7 lysozyme and mouse Tag7 protein are homologous to silkworm PGRP (Fig.4). Furthermore, the Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding RNA polymerase II (M27431) was found to contain a PGRP-like sequence. The sequence is in the complementary strand of RNA polymerase II-coding sequence and corresponds to 140 bp from the end of the registered sequence (Fig. 4). We have previously reported the purification and characterization of the PGRP from the hemolymph of the silkworm B. mori (17Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The PGRP specifically binds to peptidoglycan, and this binding leads to activation of the prophenoloxidase cascade in the plasma fraction of the silkworm hemolymph. In the present study, we cloned PGRP cDNA and the gene. The cloned PGRP cDNA contained an open reading frame (nucleotides 31–618) encoding a protein with 196 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein had a putative 23-amino acid signal sequence and a mature protein sequence. The molecular mass (19290 Da) calculated from the primary structure of the deduced mature protein is in good agreement with the value (19 kDa) determined before by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified PGRP. The absence ofN-glycosylation consensus sequence in the deduced amino acid sequence of PGRP is consistent with our previous observation that purified PGRP did not manifest reactivity to eight commercially available lectins. We have produced recombinant PGRP in a baculovirus expression system and confirmed that the protein possesses the ability to specifically bind to peptidoglycan. 3T. Nomura, T. Kanaya, and M. Ochiai, unpublished observation. This observation supports further that our cloned cDNA encodes PGRP. Among proteins of which the sequence and function are known, bacteriophage T7 lysozyme is the only protein interacting with peptidoglycan and having the sequence similarity with PGRP. Furthermore, the amino acid residues of PGRP corresponding to the five catalytically active residues of the lysozyme (25Cheng X. Zhang X. Pflugrath J.W. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4034-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) were all replaced with other amino acids. Considering the ability of PGRP to bind to peptidoglycan, the homology is understandable. At the same time, the present results concerning the PGRP sequence did not offer any clues to answering our question: What kind of activity does the complex of PGRP and peptidoglycan have? Because binding of PGRP to peptidoglycan is known to lead to the activation of protease zymogens of the prophenoloxidase cascade, we had speculated that PGRP itself is a protease zymogen of which activation is caused by its binding to peptidoglycan. However, the deduced PGRP sequence seemed to deny this possibility. We now speculate that the complex of peptidoglycan and PGRP activates a protease zymogen that is a member of the prophenoloxidase cascade. In the blood coagulation system of horseshoe crab, the factors that directly interact with elicitors such as lipopolysaccharide and β-1,3-glucan are zymogen of proteases (26Muta T. Iwanaga S. Rinkevich B. Müller W.E.G. Progress in Molecular and Subcellular Biology: Invertebrate Immunology. 15. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 154-189Google Scholar). In this respect, the component located at the initiation point of the prophenoloxidase cascade is different from that of the blood coagulation cascade. Our search for proteins with the sequence similarity to PGRP indicated that homologs to PGRP are present in mice and nematodes. The mouse Tag7 protein has been reported to be a cytokine (27Kiselev S.L. Kustikova O.S. Korobko E.V. Prokhortchouk E.B. Kabishev A.A. Lukanidin E.M. Georgiev G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18633-18639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the silkworm PGRP has a similar biological activity. The ancestral protein of the homologs to PGRP seems to have appeared before protostomia and deuterostomia diverged in evolution and to be present widely in animals. This wide distribution of PGRP suggests the possibility that insect PGRP and its homologs may generally play a role in the recognition of peptidoglycan in innate immunity. The function of PGRP in triggering the prophenoloxidase cascade may be peculiar to insects. Peptidoglycan manifests various biological activities as have been mentioned in the introduction of our previous paper (17Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and of papers by Dziarski and co-workers (6Gupta D. Kirkland T.N. Viriyakosol S. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 7Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Despite the myriad activities, the mechanism for the recognition of peptidoglycan as foreign has been poorly understood. Recently, Dziarski and co-workers showed that CD14 on murine macrophages has affinity to peptidoglycan and is involved in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB by peptidoglycan (7Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It has been established that CD14 is a receptor for LPS in mammals (3Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3406) Google Scholar). In this case, however, another protein, the LPS-binding protein, in plasma is assumed to form a complex with LPS, and K D of CD14 for the complexed LPS becomes very low in comparison with that for noncomplexed LPS. Thus, the LPS-binding protein increases the sensitivity of cells with CD14 to LPS. It would be worth testing whether PGRP works in the same way as the LPS-binding protein. A single copy of the PGRP gene was indicated to be present in the silkworm genome (Fig. 3 A). We detected a cAMP response element, NF-κB-like element, and five interferon response half-elements in the promoter region of the gene. The transcripts of the gene were detected in the fifth instar larvae before challenging them with Gram-negative bacteria or peptidoglycan. However, the transcription was up-regulated after challenging them with the microbes or the cell wall component (Fig. 2). The presence ofcis-regulatory elements like an NF-κB element and the enhancement of transcription by cell wall components of microbes are common features of acute phase proteins of insects and mammals (28Kappler C.

Whether up-regulated expression of the PGRP gene upon bacterial challenge has merits for silkworms and, if so, what those merits are remain to be studied. The intracellular events leading to the induction of acute phase immune protein synthesis are now being intensely studied in both insects and mammals. Proteins belonging to the Rel family are commonly employed in the signaling pathway for the induction in different organisms (21Hultmark D.

Recently, a Toll homolog has been reported to be involved in human innate immunity as well as adaptive immunity (33Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A.

Our present results indicated the presence of homologous pattern recognition proteins for peptidoglycan in both insects and mammals. The results seem to imply that the mechanism for extracellular recognition of microbes as foreign is conserved between insects and mammals, indicating a yet closer relation between innate immune systems in such phylogenetically remote organisms as insects and mammals. Addendum—After the submission of the manuscript of the present paper, a paper reporting a cDNA for PGRP from a mothTrichoplusia ni and its mouse and human homologs was published (34Kang D. Liu G.

Aa MDH shows 2–3-fold higher catalytic efficiency compared with a mesophilic or a thermophilic MDH at the temperature range 4–10 °C. Structural comparison of Aa MDH and Tf MDH suggests that the increased relative flexibility of active site residues, favorable surface charge distribution for substrate and cofactor, and the reduced intersubunit ion pair interactions may be the major factors for the efficient catalytic activity of Aa MDH at low temperatures.

In order to survive such extreme environments (less than 4 °C), enzymes from psychrophiles must catalyze efficiently at low temperatures (1Feller G. Narin E. Arpigny J.L. Aittaleb M. Baise E.

While good progress is being made to elucidate the adaptation mechanism of enzymes from some extremophiles including hyperthermophile, the molecular basis of cold adaptation of psychrophilic enzymes is relatively poorly understood (7Goldman A.

However, psychrophilic enzymes have generated considerable interest, since they can be used to improve the efficiency of industrial processes and for environmental applications (1Feller G. Narin E. Arpigny J.L. Aittaleb M. Baise E. Genicot S. Gerday C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 189-202Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 10Herbert R.A. Trends Biotechnol. 1992; 10: 395-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Also, comparison of the structures of psychrophilic enzymes with mesophilic, thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic counterparts may add new insights into the understanding of catalytic mechanism and analysis of thermostability factors. As a first step to understand the structural basis of cold adaptation of psychrophilic enzymes, we have carried out biochemical and structural studies of malate dehydrogenase from Aquaspillium arcticum, a psychrophilic bacterium that was isolated from Arctic sediments and grows optimally at 4 °C (11Jordan D.C. McNicol P.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1979; 25: 947-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). MDH1 is a homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in the presence of NAD in the citric acid cycle and thus plays a major role in central metabolism (12Goward C.R. Nicholls D.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, a certain amount of MDH is always expected to be present in most living organisms. Several MDHs from different sources have been extensively studied in genetic and biochemical aspects; sequences of a large number of malate dehydrogenases from organisms representing Archea, Bacteria, and Eukarya have been reported, and many of their gene products have been characterized. Furthermore, crystal structures of MDHs from the thermophile Thermus flavus (13Kelly C.A. Nishiyama M. Ohnishi Y. Beppu T. Birktoft J.J.

Narinx E. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17448-17453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), amylase from Alteromonas haloplanctis A23 (4Feller G. Payan F. Theys F. Qian M. Haser R.R.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have been isolated, and their characteristics have been compared with mesophilic or thermophilic counterparts. The commonly observed biochemical features of these cold active enzymes are (i) their increased catalytic efficiencies at low temperatures and (ii) significantly increased thermolability compared with mesophilic or thermophilic counterparts. However, it is difficult to understand the properties of cold active enzymes at the molecular level from the studies described above, since most of these studies were carried out in the absence of structures of psychrophilic enzymes. In the present study, we have cloned a MDH gene from A. arcticum and purified and characterized its product. We also report here the high resolution crystal structures of apo-Aa MDH, Aa MDH·NADH binary complex, and Aa MDH·NAD·oxaloacetate ternary complex (Table I) and describe our analysis of how psychrophilic MDH may catalyze efficiently at low temperatures.Table IDiffraction data and refinement statisticsAa MDHAa MDH · NADHAa MDH · NAD · OAASpace groupP21212P21212P21212Cell dimensions (Å)a58.9759.0258.30b102.24102.52101.70c53.6953.9652.76Total observations97,40642,76968,254Unique reflections >2ς23,65715,7009273R sym(%)aR sym = ΣhΣi‖I h,i −I h‖/ΣhΣiΣh,i for the intensity (I) of i observations of reflectionh.8.17.47.5R cryst(%)17.418.319.8R free(%)b10% of total reflections were set aside to calculate theR free value.17.820.823.4Resolution (Å)8.0–1.98.0–2.18.0–2.5r.m.s. bonds (Å)cRoot mean square deviations from ideal geometry.0.0090.0080.010r.m.s. angles (degrees)cRoot mean square deviations from ideal geometry.1.451.511.65a R sym = ΣhΣi‖I h,i −I h‖/ΣhΣiΣh,i for the intensity (I) of i observations of reflectionh.b 10% of total reflections were set aside to calculate theR free value.c Root mean square deviations from ideal geometry. Open table in a new tab Four liters of A. arcticum cells, obtained from DSM, were grown in tryptic soy broth (Difco) at 4 °C for 3–4 days. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 mm of Tris-Cl, pH 8.2, buffer containing 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl chloride. The cells were lysed in a French press, and the insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.2). Fractions containing MDH were eluted between 0.4 and 0.5 m NaCl. These fractions were pooled, concentrated using ultrafiltration, and applied to a Blue Sepharose CL-6B column preequilibrated with same buffer. Aa MDH was eluted with 2 mm NADH. The protein was further purified by a size exclusion column (Superdex 75). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the final preparation showed a single band of protein with 95% homogeneity. Trypsin digestion of a purified Aa MDH results in two fragments with approximate molecular mass of 27 and 9 kDa. N-terminal sequencing of intact Aa MDH and a fragment corresponding to 27 kDa provides the sequences AKTPMRVAVTGAAGQLXYSLL andXDLXIXXQIFTVQGXAXDAVA, respectively. Two degenerate oligomers were derived from these sequences, and polymerase chain reaction was performed using these primers and genomic DNA from A. arcticum as a template. The polymerase chain reaction resulted in a major single product with the expected size and several nonspecific products. The genomic DNA was digested by several restriction enzymes, blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane, and analyzed by Southern hybridization using the polymerase chain reaction-amplified product as a probe. A 2.4-kbHindIII fragment that hybridized to the polymerase chain reaction product was isolated, ligated with pBluescript KS(+), and transformed into E. coli DH5α. Sequencing of this plasmid confirmed the presence of a complete Aa MDH gene. Kinetic parameters were determined for Aa MDH, Tf MDH (Sigma), and MDH fromE. coli (Ec MDH; Sigma). Reaction mixtures containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 μm oxaloacetate, and enzyme were incubated at 4, 10, and 37 °C. The NADH (5–200 μm final concentration) were added to the mixture, and the amount of NAD produced was measured at various temperatures and times. K m and k cat values were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots using the ENZFITTER (18Letherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A Nonlinear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC/P 52. Elsevier Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom1987Google Scholar) data analysis program. Thermostability was measured for Aa MDH, Ec MDH, and Tf MDH in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, 500 μmoxaloacetate, 100 μm NADH, pH 7.5. Each enzyme was incubated at 55 °C for various times and then cooled on ice. The residual enzyme activity was measured with 500 μmoxaloacetate and 100 μm NADH at 37 °C using the standard protocol described above. The enzyme was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 100 mm NaCl. Equal volumes of protein (10 mg/ml) and reservoir solution (100 mmTris-HCl, 400 mm sodium acetate, 35% polyethylene glycol 4000, pH 8.0) were mixed and equilibrated with 1 ml of reservoir solution at 18 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals with a size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm appeared within 4–10 days. NADH binding was carried out by transferring the crystal to a reservoir solution containing 100 mm NADH for 2 days. To make the ternary complex, the crystal was initially soaked in reservoir solution containing 100 mm NAD for 2 days, and then oxaloacetate was added to a final concentration of 200 mmand incubated at 18 °C for 36 h. x-ray diffraction data were measured to 1.9 Å for the apo-Aa MDH, 2.1 Å for the binary complex, and 2.5 Å for the ternary complex. All data were measured on a Mar30 image plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode x-ray generator. Data for the apo-Aa MDH and binary complex were measured at 18 °C, whereas the data for the ternary complex were collected at −190 °C using a flash frozen crystal. Determination of unit cell parameters and integration of reflections was performed using the program DENZO (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar) from the HKL package. Data were scaled and merged with SCALEPACK (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The structure of the apoenzyme was solved by the molecular replacement method as implemented in X-PLOR (20Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) using a search model built from Tf MDH, where side chains of nonidentical residues were replaced by alanine or glycine and the portions with inserted or deleted regions were removed. Rotation and translation functions of the method gave a unanimous solution; the highest peak from the translation search in the resolution range of 15–4 Å was 3 times higher than the mean value. The initial R-factor was 48.15%. One round of rigid body refinement dropped the R-factor to 29.7% in the resolution range of 10–4 Å. With a correctly positioned model, ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ and 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ maps were calculated, and manual adjustment of the model was performed using the program CHAIN (21Sacks J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 224-225Crossref Google Scholar). The model was further refined using X-PLOR with Engh and Huber stereochemical parameters (22Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are presented in Table I. Because the first two N-terminal residues are not clearly defined, they are not included in the final model. The final models contain 327 residues and 220 water molecules for apo-Aa MDH; 327 residues, 127 water molecules, and 1 NADH molecule for the binary complex; and 327 residues, 62 water molecules, 1 NAD molecule, and 1 oxaloacetate molecule for the ternary complex. Aa MDH is composed of 329 amino acids, and its sequence is most similar to those of Tf MDH (61% identity and over 90% similarity) among all available MDH sequences (Fig.1 a). Composition analysis shows that Aa MDH has slightly lower Arg/(Arg + Lys) content (43%) than Tf MDH (51%). While Glu (13 versus 24%) and Arg (13versus 19%) contents in Tf MDH are significantly higher than those in Aa MDH, other charged residue contents are similar in two enzymes. The numbers of glycine (28 versus 27 for Aa MDHversus Tf MDH) and proline (16 versus 16) residues are very similar in the two proteins. While numbers of hydrophobic residues with the aromatic ring are equal in both MDH, some differences are observed in isoleucine (23 versus 17), valine (22 versus 27), and leucine (27 versus30). The kinetic constants were determined for MDHs from three species, a psychrophile, a mesophile, and a thermophile at three different temperatures, and are summarized in TableII. Thek cat/K m of Aa MDH was approximately 2–3-fold higher than that of Ec MDH at 4–10 °C. The activities of Tf MDH at 4–10 °C were too low, and we could not measure the kinetic constant of Tf MDH at these temperatures within our limit. The k cat/K m values of Aa MDH and Ec MDH are almost equal at 37 °C.Table IIComparison of kinetic and thermolability parameters of three MDHsParametersAa MDHEc MDHTf MDHKinetics4 °Ck cat(s−1)152 ± 2293 ± 15K mapp(μm)16 ± 423 ± 5NDaND, kinetic constants could not be determined because of low enzyme activity at these temperatures.k cat/K mapp11410 °Ck cat(s−1)277 ± 18171 ± 18K mapp(μm)23 ± 426 ± 4NDk cat/K mapp12737 °Ck cat(s−1)1111 ± 1501108 ± 290419 ± 33K mapp(μm)45 ± 1056 ± 1114 ± 4k cat/K mapp252030Thermolabilityt 1/210 min>2 hTm58 °C>95 °Ca ND, kinetic constants could not be determined because of low enzyme activity at these temperatures. Open table in a new tab For stability studies, each enzyme was preheated at various temperatures for a given time, and the activities were measured. The half-time of inactivation (t 12) of each MDH is shown in Table II. The activity of Aa MDH decreased to 50% at 55 °C for 10 min. The half-time of inactivation (t 12) of Ec MDH was 20 min at 55 °C, showing a 2-fold increase compared with Aa MDH. Tf MDH retains full activity at 55 °C for more than 2 h. It has been reported that Tf MDH is fully active after heating at 90 °C for 1 h (13Kelly C.A. Nishiyama M. Ohnishi Y. Beppu T. Birktoft J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3913-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism measurement also shows a large difference of Tm values between Aa MDH (58 °C) and Tf MDH (>95 °C). We will focus on a structural comparison between psychrophilic Aa MDH and thermophilic Tf MDH throughout this study, since these two enzymes show remarkable sequence similarity while having notably different biochemical properties. Each monomer of homodimeric Aa MDH folds into two domains with different functions (Fig. 1, b and c). The nucleotide binding domain is formed from a twisted N-terminal six-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices. The C-terminal catalytic domain consists of two β-sheets and several helices. The active site is in a cleft between two domains. The asymmetric unit contains an Aa MDH monomer, and the dimer has a crystallographic 2-fold axis. The dimeric interface is formed from helices α1, α2, α6, and α9-loop-α10 (Fig. 1 c). As expected from the high sequence similarity, the overall structure of Aa MDH is very similar to that of Tf MDH, and it can be superimposed with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.8 Å for 319 C-α atoms. The largest differences are observed in the loop region between α10 and β10, where the r.m.s. deviation value is 3.8 Å. Minor differences are observed in the loop between β2 and α2, where two more residues are inserted in Aa MDH. The Aa MDH and Ec MDH show more significant deviations (r.m.s. deviation of 2.4 Å for 256 C-α atoms), reflecting their low sequence identity of 27%. The presence of NADH in the NADH-soaked crystal was clearly identified from the simulated annealed omit map of NADH complex crystal (Fig.2 a). Comparisons between apo-Aa MDH and Aa MDH·NADH complex structures show an r.m.s. deviation of 0.31 Å, suggesting that NADH did not induce any noticeable conformational changes. The NADH is hydrogen-bonded to the side chains of Glu43 (2.7, 2.9 Å), Gln115 (3.3 Å), Asn134 (3.5 Å), and His190 (3.0 Å) and main chain atoms of Gly12 (3.2 Å), Gln16 (2.9 Å), Ile17 (2.9 Å), Val132 (3.0 Å), and Asn134 (3.1 Å) (Fig. 2 b). Most of the NADH binding residues are highly conserved both in Aa MDH and Tf MDH (Fig.1 a). However, the side chain of Gln14 of Tf MDH forms a hydrogen bond to the NO1 (3.3 Å) atom and AO-1 (3.1 Å) atom of NADH, whereas the side chain of a corresponding residue, Gln16 in Aa MDH points away from the NADH. These differences may contribute to the increased K m of NADH in Aa MDH compared with that in Tf MDH at 37 °C. It has been proposed that the surface loop formed by residues 90–100 plays an important role in the binding of NADH (13Kelly C.A. Nishiyama M. Ohnishi Y. Beppu T. Birktoft J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3913-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Birktoft J.J. Rhodes G. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6065-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In lactate dehydrogenase, another NADH binding enzyme whose tertiary structure is similar to MDH, significant conformational changes in this loop occur upon binding of NADH (23Abad-zapatero C. Griffith J.P. Sussman J.L. Rossman M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 445-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Dunn C.R. Wilks H.M. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Muirhead H. Holbrook J.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1991; 332: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). While no direct evidence of such gross conformational changes within the surface loop has been observed in MDH, the compositions of the amino acids and the main chain atom positions in this region are very similar in both Aa MDH and Tf MDH. MDH catalyzes an ordered reaction, where NADH binds first, followed by the dicarboxylic acid substrate (25Silverstein E. Sulebele G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2543-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The substrate binding site was identified by first soaking the crystal in buffer containing NAD and later with oxaloacetate. The resulting omit map clearly reveals the presence of a NAD and a substrate (Fig.3 a). Although oxaloacetate binds near NAD, no direct interactions were observed between the two molecules. The C-4 atom of the nicotinamide moiety of NAD is 5.9 Å away from the C-2 atom of oxaloacetate, and a water molecule is present between the two atoms (Fig. 3 b). Important residues involved in oxaloacetate binding include Arg165 (2.6 and 3.2 Å), His190 (3.1 Å), and Ser241 (3.3 Å). The main chain atoms of Arg229 (3.5 Å) and Gly230 (2.9 Å) also form hydrogen bonds to oxaloacetate (Fig. 3 b). The carbonyl oxygen of Gly227 is 2.9 Å away from the O1A atom of oxaloacetate. Thus, it is possible that these two atoms may form a hydrogen bond if the O1A atom of oxaloacetate becomes protonated. In lactate dehydrogenase, the C-4 atom of the nicotinamide ring in NADH and the C-2 atom of the substrate analogue, oxamate, are located closer (3.7 Å), such that the proton can be directly transferred to the C-2 atom of lactate from NADH (23Abad-zapatero C. Griffith J.P. Sussman J.L. Rossman M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 445-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Dunn C.R. Wilks H.M. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Muirhead H. Holbrook J.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1991; 332: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Structure comparison reveals that the binding of substrate to LDH induces a gross conformational change (up to 14 Å) in the surface loop around the NADH binding region, which is equivalent to residues 89–100 in Aa MDH. However, the binding of oxaloacetate to Aa MDH did not induce any notable conformational changes as judged by comparison of the ternary complex structure with apo- and binary Aa MDH enzyme structures (r.m.s. deviation of 0.33 and 0.34 Å, respectively). Therefore, it is possible that the large conformational change upon oxaloacetate binding may be necessary to bring the substrate closer to NAD, and this structural rearrangement is limited inside the crystal due to the crystal packing. Thus far, no ternary complex structures of MDH from other organisms, substrate, and coenzyme have been reported. However, the ternary complex of Ec MDH, NAD, and substrate analogue (citrate) has been determined at 1.9-Å resolution, and the distance between the C-4 atom of the nicotinamide ring in NAD and the C-3 atom of citrate was 4.9 Å (15Hall M.D. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Comparison of the oxaloacetate binding site of Aa MDH and an equivalent region of Tf MDH reveals that all of the residues interacting with oxaloacetate are conserved except for Gly227, which has been replaced by alanine in Tf MDH. Since the main chain of glycine has more conformational freedom than any other amino acid, substitution of Gly227 in Aa MDH from Ala227 may provide more local flexibility in Aa MDH, and this may partly contribute to the high catalytic efficiency of Aa MDH at low temperatures. It has been proposed that increased flexibility is the most important factor for the catalytic efficiency of psychrophilic enzymes at low temperatures (1Feller G. Narin E. Arpigny J.L. Aittaleb M. Baise E. Genicot S. Gerday C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 189-202Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 2Feller G. Gerday C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The crystallographic thermal factors of the structures of Aa MDH and Tf MDH have been compared to analyze the flexibility of both enzymes. Aa MDH·NADH complex had an average B-factor of 15.10 Å2 for main chain atoms, significantly lower than that of Tf MDH·NADH, 23.56 Å2. Also, average B-factors for main chain atoms of each domain in Aa MDH (N-domain, 14.75 Å2; C-domain, 15.45 Å2) show similar differences compared with those in Tf MDH (N-domain, 23.14 Å2; C-domain, 24.03 Å2). However, differences in resolution, packing, solvent content, and quality of data could contribute to B-factors. To correlate the local flexibility of each MDH in an equivalent scale of thermal parameters, we have divided the B-factors of all atoms in each enzyme by an average B-factor of a whole molecule (termed relative B-factor) and compared these values for the two proteins (Fig.4). All main chain atoms (Gly12, Gln16, Ile17, Val132, Asn134; Gly227, Arg229, Gly230) and most of the side chain atoms (Glu43, Arg165, Ser241) interacting with NADH and oxaloacetate in Aa MDH had up to approximately 2-fold increased relative B-factors, reflecting their increased relative flexibility (Fig. 4). We have also used two different methods to compare the relative flexibility of the active site regions in both MDHs. First, the B-factors for the atoms of active site residues were divided by the average B-factors of the rest of the atoms in the whole molecule. This was to remove any bias resulting from the active site residues in local flexibility calculation. Second, the average B-factors for the whole molecule without the active site residues were subtracted from the B-factors for each of the atoms in the active site, and these values were divided by the S.D. values for the average B-factors of the whole molecule without the active site residues. In either case, the values that may represent the relative local flexibility for the MDHs were higher in Aa MDH compared with Tf MDH, suggesting that the active site in Aa MDH is relatively more flexible (Fig. 4). The slightly increased flexibility in the regions of NADH and oxaloacetate binding sites in Aa MDH may facilitate the catalytic activity at low temperatures. Recent comparative studies of citrate synthase from Antarctic bacterial strain DS2–3R and its hyperthermophilic counterpart have shown that an overall average main chain B-factor was much lower in psychrophilic citrate synthase compared with that of hyperthermophilic enzyme (26Russell R.J.M. Gerike U. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the small domain in psychrophilic citrate synthase showed more flexibility compared with the large domain, and this difference is more significant in the psychrophilic enzyme than that of its hyperthermophilic counterpart (26Russell R.J.M. Gerike U. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the domain movement of citrate synthase for enzymatic catalysis upon substrate binding at low temperature is more favorable in psychrophilic citrate synthase. The hydrogen exchange experiments also show evidence for an enhanced rigidity of thermophilic proteins as compared with those from mesophilic proteins (27Bonisch H. Backmann J. Kath T. Naumann D. Schafer G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One of the most remarkable differences between the structures of Aa MDH and Tf MDH is their charge distributions in the accessible surface (28Nicholas A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.5, the surface around the NADH binding region in Tf MDH is dominated by negative potentials, whereas that in Aa MDH has significantly weaker negative potentials around the corresponding region. The differences in the position of basic residues of the surface loop comprising residues 91–100 (Arg91 and Lys92 and Lys106 in Tf MDH/Arg93, Arg95, and Lys110 in Aa MDH) results in the different charge distributions within this loop (Fig. 5). The oxaloacetate binding regions in each MDH also show some discrepancies in charge distribution. The oxaloacetate binding region of Aa MDH has more basic regions compared with Tf MDH, since Arg165, His190, and Lys228 are present in Aa MDH, whereas Arg161, His186, and Gln228are in the equivalent region in Tf MDH. The increased positive potential at and around the oxaloacetate binding site and the significantly decreased negative surface potential at the NADH binding region in Aa MDH may facilitate the interaction of a negatively charged substrate toward the surface of the enzyme and may increase the catalytic efficiency at low temperature. It has been suggested that high flexibility of an enzyme is tightly correlated to the increased thermolability of the enzyme. Thus, we have analyzed the several factors that could contribute to enzyme stability. These include the number and location of proline/glycine residues and the number of inter- and intrasubunit ion pairs, hydrogen bonds, buried surface areas, and cavities (TableIII).Table IIIComparisons of ion pairs, hydrogen bonds, and surface area of two MDHsAa MDHTf MDHNo. of intrasubunit ion pairs/subunit128No. of intrasubunit ion pairs/residue0.040.03No. of intersubunit ion pairs in dimer (buried/total)4/65/10No. of intrasubunit hydrogen bonds/subunit813800No. of intersubunit hydrogen bonds in dimer4656Accessible surface area of a subunit (Å2)13925.514318.9Buried surface area of dimer (Å2)3048.73165.0TotalHydrophobic1937.31988.3Polar553.2438.5Charged558.2738.2No. of the completely buried atoms in a subunit12771253Fraction0.520.50No. of the completely buried atoms in the dimer26802577Fraction0.540.53Cavities/subunit88The number of ion pairs and hydrogen bonds in Tf MDH have been analyzed from a subunit B. The distance range is 2.2–4.0 Å for an ion pair and 2.2–3.5 Å for a hydrogen bond. All the values of Tf MDH are calculated using the subunit B of Tf MDH structure (accession code 1 bmd of the Protein Data Bank). Open table in a new tab The number of ion pairs and hydrogen bonds in Tf MDH have been analyzed from a subunit B. The distance range is 2.2–4.0 Å for an ion pair and 2.2–3.5 Å for a hydrogen bond. All the values of Tf MDH are calculated using the subunit B of Tf MDH structure (accession code 1 bmd of the Protein Data Bank). The numbers of glycine and proline residues are very similar in both MDHs, and the positions of these residues are highly conserved in Aa MDH and Tf MDH (Fig. 1 a). While the numbers of Asp, Lys, and His residues are similar, Tf MDH has significantly more Glu and Arg than Aa MDH. Despite such differences, Tf MDH has the same number of intrasubunit ion pairs compared with those of Aa MDH (Table III). Also, an equal number of intrasubunit ion pair networks are found in Aa MDH (Arg24–Asp29–Lys33, Glu319–Arg101–Glu320) and in Tf MDH (Arg22–Glu27–Lys31, Glu251–Arg156–Asp255). However, Aa MDH has about half the number of intersubunit ion pairs as Tf MDH (Fig. 6). In addition, only three residues, A-Arg165, B-Asp62, and A-Arg229 (A and B represent each subunit) form ion pair networks, whereas five residue ion pair networks (B-Lys168, A-Glu57, B-Arg229, A-Asp58, and B-Arg161) are observed in Tf MDH. Ion pairs have emerged as a critical force in stabilizing hyperthermophilic enzymes (29Lim J.-H. Yu Y.G. Han Y.S. Cho S.-J. Ahn B.-Y. Kim S.-H. Cho Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 30Yip K.S.P. Stillman T.J. Britton K.L. Artymiuk P.J. Baker P.J. Sedelnikova S.E. Engle P.C. Pasquo A. Chiaraluce R. Consalvi V.

Biol. 1995; 246: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, the relative importance of intra- or intersubunit ion pairs are still unclear. Also, the contribution of ion pairs to the stability of general proteins other than hyperthermophilic proteins requires further analyses. Nevertheless, the formation of an ion pair network is known to be important to the protein stability. The decreased number of intersubunit ion pairs and ion pair networks is probably one of the major forces in the thermolability of Aa MDH. Recent comparative studies of psychrophilic citrate synthase and its hyperthermophilic counterpart reveal that the psychrophilic enzyme has more intrasubunit and fewer intersubunit ion pairs, emphasizing the importance of intersubunit ion pairs and agreeing with our present analyses (26Russell R.J.M. Gerike U. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The numbers of hydrogen bonds in both MDHs show similar patterns of ion pairs; Aa MDH has more intrasubunit hydrogen bonds, whereas more intersubunit hydrogen bonds are found in Tf MDH . The Aa MDH subunit has slightly lower accessible surface area compared with a subunit of Tf MDH (Table III). Aa MDH dimer has 116 Å of less buried surface area compared with that of Tf MDH. Considering that each square Å has about 25 cal/mol of energy gain, the decreased buried surface area of Aa MDH provides an ∼2.9-kcal loss. The more significant difference is found in the nature of the buried surface area in each MDH. While the hydrophobic character is similar in both enzymes, the portion of charged residues in the buried surface area is remarkably smaller in Aa MDH (28%) compared with that of Tf MDH (37%). The increased charged character of the buried surface interface in Tf MDH results in the increased number of intersubunit ion pairs and charged polar group interactions. It has been proposed that the increased number of buried ion pairs in the protein interfaces could contribute to protein stability unlike those present in the core of a protein because of the differences in the surrounding environment and desolvation energy (32Xu D. Lin S.L. Nussinov R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, slightly decreased buried surface area and a smaller portion of charged residues in dimeric interface may contribute to the increased thermolability of Aa MDH. The number of cavities in both MDHs is the same, and the size of the cavities was very similar (33Kleywegt G.J. Jones A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have reported the isolation and biochemical characterization of a MDH from the psychrophilic bacterium, A. arcticum, as well as three x-ray structures of Aa MDH. The psychrophilic MDH shows some interesting features: (i) it has 2–3-fold higher k cat/K m values compared with a mesophilic MDH at a temperature range of 4–10 °C; (ii) its primary structure is highly similar to that of a thermophilic MDH from Tf MDH; and (iii) Aa MDH shows significantly increased thermolability compared with Tf MDH."
https://openalex.org/W1996100284,"In vivo phage display is a powerful method to study organ- and tissue-specific vascular addresses. Using this approach, peptides capable of tissue-specific homing can be identified by performing a selection for that trait in vivo. We recently showed that the CGFECVRQCPERC (termed GFE-1) peptide can selectively bind to mouse lung vasculature after an intravenous injection. Our aim in the present study was to identify the receptor for this lung-homing peptide. By using affinity chromatography, we isolated a 55-kDa lung cell-surface protein that selectively binds to the GFE-1 peptide. Protein sequencing established the identity of the receptor as membrane dipeptidase (MDP), a cell-surface zinc metalloprotease involved in the metabolism of glutathione, leukotriene D4, and certain β-lactam antibiotics. Phage particles displaying the GFE-1 peptide selectively bind to COS-1 cells transfected with the murine MDP cDNA. Moreover, the synthetic GFE-1 peptide could inhibit MDP activity. By establishing MDP as the receptor for the GFE-1 peptide, our results suggest potential applications for both MDP and the GFE-1 peptide in delivery of compounds to the lungs. This work also demonstrates that cell-surface proteases can be involved in tissue-specific homing."

NF-κB activation by stimuli such as LPS, interleukin (IL)-1β, and phorbol ester, but not tumor necrosis factor (TNF), was reversibly inhibited by HNE in a dose-dependent manner in human monocytic cells, whereas AP-1 binding was unaffected. Using similar HNE concentrations, LPS-induced κB- and TNF or IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription was prevented. Furthermore, pretreatment with HNE suppressed TNF production but not lactate dehydrogenase levels. Under these conditions the binding of LPS to monocytic cells was not significantly affected. However, induced proteolysis of the inhibitory proteins IκB-α, IκB-β, and, at a later time point, IκB-ε was prevented.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether HNE is able to modulate the activation of the NF-κB system by different stimuli or alter the expression of the NF-κB target gene product TNF. Furthermore, we examined to what extent this aldehyde affects κB- as well as TNF and IL-8 promoter-dependent transcriptional activity. We also characterized the effects of HNE on the stimulus-induced proteolysis of IκB-α, -β, and -ε, on the three major peptidase activities of the proteasome, as well as on the phosphorylation status of IκB-α, in order to obtain more insight into the mechanisms involved. THP-1 monocytic cells (DSM, Braunschweig, Germany) were maintained in suspension in RPMI 1640 (Glutamax-1, low endotoxin) containing 7% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Myoclone super plus, low endotoxin), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) as described (41Brand K. Mackman N. Curtiss L.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For the experiments, the cells were plated at a density of 3 × 106 per well in 6-well culture dishes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from blood samples of normal donors by the Ficoll-Paque method as described (42Brand K. Banka C.L. Mackman N. Terkeltaub R.A. Fan S.-T. Curtiss L.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Monocytes were isolated from mononuclear cells by adherence to achieve a purity of approximately 90% as determined by flow cytometry. The adherent monocytes were cultured overnight in the same medium as THP-1 cells with 10% FCS before the experiment was started. Mono Mac 6 cells (43Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Thiel E. Fuetterer A.

LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4), FITC-LPS, IL-1β, TNF, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and okadaic acid (OA) were purchased from Sigma. The proteasome inhibitor PSI was purchased from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). Endotoxin contamination was screened by the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and only reagents with an endotoxin content of <10 pg/ml were used in the experiments. A potential toxicity of the cell culture conditions applied was monitored by cell morphology and count, trypan blue dye exclusion, and the WST-1 cell toxicity test (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed as described previously (4Brand K. Eisele T. Kreusel U. Page M. Page S. Haas M. Gerling A. Kaltschmidt C. Neumann F.-J. Mackman N. Baeuerle P.A. Walli A.K.

The prototypic immunoglobulin κ-chain oligonucleotide was used as a probe and labeled by annealing of complementary primers followed by primer extension with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (>3,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products, Brussels, Belgium) and deoxynucleoside triphosphates (Boehringer Mannheim). Nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were incubated with radiolabeled DNA probes (∼10 ng; 105 cpm) for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 50 ng of poly(dI-dC)/μl). Samples were run in 0.25× TBE buffer (10× TBE is as follows: 890 mm Tris, 890 mm boric acid, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) on nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels. The binding of Sp-1 and AP-1 was also analyzed by EMSA using specific consensus oligonucleotides (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) that were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (>5,000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim). Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. The following reporter plasmids were utilized in transfection studies: 3×κB. luci, a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid containing 3 copies of a prototypic (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) κB site (45Haas M.

These individual plasmids were transiently co-transfected with a constitutively active Renilla luciferase control plasmid (pRLtk, Promega) into THP-1 cells using a DEAE-dextran-based protocol (4Brand K. Eisele T. Kreusel U. Page M. Page S. Haas M. Gerling A. Kaltschmidt C. Neumann F.-J. Mackman N. Baeuerle P.A. Walli A.K. Neumeier D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

After transfection, cells were plated out at a density of 2 × 106/3 ml RPMI with 7% FCS in a 6-well plate and incubated for 2 days. After this time, the cells were first preincubated with HNE for 1 h followed by a 5-h LPS stimulation. Subsequent to stimulation the cells were lysed and the luciferase activity was determined using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). The results are expressed as firefly luciferase relative light units (RLU) divided by the RLU values obtained for theRenilla luciferase. The concentration of TNF protein in the medium taken from experimental cultures was measured by sandwich type immunoassay, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Coulter Immunotech, Hamburg, Germany). The activity (units/liter) of LDH in cytosolic extracts was measured in an automated colorimetric analysis system (Boehringer Mannheim/Hitachi 737) at 37 °C. Cytosolic extracts were isolated as described earlier (45Haas M. Page S. Page M. Neumann F.-J. Marx N. Adam M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed with 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (0.1% SDS) as described previously (41Brand K. Mackman N. Curtiss L.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the wet blotting technique. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal domains of the inhibitors IκB-α, -β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), and -ε (a kind gift from Prof. N. Rice, (NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD) or with a monoclonal antibody against α-actin (Sigma). To detect IκB phosphorylation we used a polyclonal phospho-specific anti-IκB-α-antibody (Calbiochem) which detects IκB-α only when activated by phosphorylation at Ser-32. This incubation was followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Antibody binding to IκB proteins was visualized on x-ray film using the Western blot Chemiluminescent Reagent Plus (NEN Life Science Products). The protein size was confirmed by molecular weight standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, and Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). Purified yeast 20 S proteasomes (kindly provided by Prof. R. Huber, Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) (46Groll M. Ditzel L. Loewe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar) were incubated with either HNE orN-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 37 °C. The assay was started by addition of fluorogenic substrates (Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany; dissolved in Tris buffer, 1% Me2SO) for chymotrypsin-like (Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, 8 μm), trypsin-like (Bz-Phe-Val-Arg-AMC, 8 μm), or peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing (Cbz-Leu-Leu-Glu-βNA, 40 μm) activities, and conducted at 37 °C (where AMC is 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; βNA is β-naphthylamide; Suc is succinyl; Bz is benzoyl; Cbz is benzyloxycarbonyl). The rates of substrate hydrolysis were determined using a luminescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Weiterstadt, Germany). Mono Mac 6 cells, grown in LPS-negative medium as described, were incubated with or without HNE at 106 cells per ml for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, the cells were incubated with and without LPS at 10 μg/ml and 5 min later FITC-LPS was added at 1 μg/ml. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed, and 104 cells per sample were analyzed using an EPICS Version 753 flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Krefeld, Germany). The percentage of positive cells was determined by subtraction of the histogram for the LPS-competed sample from the histogram of the non-competed sample. Specific mean fluorescence intensity is the delta mean of the competed and uncompeted histogram in channels. Kinase assays were performed essentially as described (47Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C.

Cytosolic extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation in TNT buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, pepstatin A, chymostatin 0.75 μg/ml each; Sigma). Unspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 1 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 25 μl of 6% protein A-agarose (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by immunoprecipitation for 2 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-IKK-β antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 25 μl of 6% protein A-agarose. After washing three times with TNT buffer and three times with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μmNa3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, pepstatin A, chymostatin 0.75 μg/ml each), the kinase reaction was carried out in kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and 500 ng of the substrate GST-IκB-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were analyzed on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (0.1% SDS), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. For OA stimulation experiments cytosolic extracts of unstimulated cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with OA (50–200 nm) in the presence or absence of HNE (25 μm). In addition, 2 mm ATP (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 mg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma), and 10 mmcreatine phosphate (Boehringer Mannheim) were supplemented. The level of phosphorylated IκB-α was analyzed by Western blot using an antibody which detects IκB-α when phosphorylated at Ser-32. The initial experiments were performed to examine whether HNE affects the activation of NF-κB or other transcriptional systems (Sp-1, AP-1). THP-1 monocytic cells were preincubated with different concentrations of HNE and then stimulated for 1 h with LPS (1 μg/ml). The activation of NF-κB was determined by EMSA. In the absence of HNE we observed the expected dramatic activation of NF-κB by LPS (Fig.1 A). This increase was slightly affected by pretreatment with HNE at 6.25 μm, significantly decreased by 12.5 and 25 μm, and completely abolished by 50 μm. No effect of HNE alone on NF-κB binding activity was observed (25 or 50 μm HNE, no induction of NF-κB activity above base line). In the same nuclear extracts we also examined the binding of nuclear proteins to oligonucleotides comprising the Sp-1 consensus sequence, which was unchanged by HNE treatment (Fig. 1 A). The slight increase of AP-1 binding in the presence of LPS was also not significantly changed by HNE (25 μm, no inhibition compared with the LPS control). Furthermore, we determined the effect of HNE ex vivo in isolated human adherent monocytes. Similarly as observed above, in these primary monocytic cells the LPS-induced NF-κB activation was also inhibited by HNE in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). In addition, experiments were performed with monocytic Mono Mac 6 cells, which were also incubated with or without HNE followed by a 1-h LPS stimulus (100 ng/ml). EMSA showed an HNE dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced NF-κB activation (50 μm HNE, inhibition below base line; 25 μm HNE, 62% inhibition). We then tested whether HNE (25 μm) modulates the activation of NF-κB by other stimuli such as IL-1β, PMA, and TNF. Our experiments demonstrated a marked inhibition of NF-κB activation induced by a 1-h incubation with 10 pg/ml IL-1β (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, pretreatment with HNE also significantly affected both short and long term incubation with PMA (50 ng/ml). In contrast, the activation of NF-κB by treatment with TNF (0.5 to 4.0 ng/ml) for 0.5 or 1 h was not affected by 25 μm HNE (Fig.1 C, and data not shown), which suggests selective and differential inhibitory actions of HNE. A potential toxic effect of HNE on monocytic cells was monitored by cell morphology and count, trypan blue dye exclusion, and the WST-1 cell toxicity test. HNE was not found to be toxic at the concentrations and conditions applied in our study (50 and 25 μm HNE, no decrease in metabolic activity after 24 h incubation compared with the untreated control using the WST-1 test). The next experiments tested whether the inhibition of NF-κB by pretreatment with HNE is reversible. THP-1 cells were pretreated with HNE (25 μm), washed intensively, and transferred to a new culture dish. At different time points LPS was added for a 1-h incubation period. When LPS was added immediately or 2 h after removal of HNE a significant inhibition of NF-κB was detected (Fig. 2 A). However, when cells were activated with LPS 4 h after HNE removal, a reduction of the inhibitory effect was already observed. The LPS-induced stimulation of NF-κB at 24 h after the HNE treatment was no longer impaired, which indicates that the effect of HNE is temporary and reversible. It should be mentioned that the observation that addition of LPS does not activate NF-κB even 2 h after HNE is removed also demonstrates that the effect of this aldehyde is not due to an interaction with the stimulatory molecule in the supernatant. Furthermore, a different incubation condition was used, i.e.HNE was added together with or varying times (10 min steps) after the addition of LPS. These experiments showed that HNE (25 μm) was still effective when given to the cells as late as approximately 20 min after LPS (Fig. 2 B). In order to examine whether HNE selectively prevents κB-dependent transcription in our system, THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter construct bearing three copies of a prototypic κB site (45Haas M.

Incubation with LPS dramatically induced the transcriptional activity of this construct (Fig. 3 A). This effect was strongly inhibited by preincubation with HNE. In contrast, H"

Overexpression of hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) results in suppression of T lymphocyte activation as measured by T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of transcription factors binding to the 5′ promoter of the interleukin-2 gene. Efforts to pinpoint the exact site of action and specificity of HePTP in the signaling cascade revealed that HePTP acts directly on the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases Erk1 and 2 and consequently reduces the magnitude and duration of their catalytic activation in intact T cells. In contrast, HePTP had no effects on N-terminal c-Jun kinase or on events upstream of the MAP kinases. The specificity of HePTP correlated with its physical association through its noncatalytic N terminus with Erk and another MAP kinase, p38, but not Jnk or other proteins. We propose that HePTP plays a negative role in antigen receptor signaling by specifically regulating MAP kinases in the cytosol and at early time points of T cell activation before the activation-induced expression of nuclear dual-specific MAP kinase phosphatases.

Although the phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) content of cellular proteins is the net result of the opposing effects of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases),1 most investigators have concentrated on the protein-tyrosine kinases, and considerably less is currently known about the PTPases. The hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) was cloned from human T lymphocytes (4Zanke B. Suzuki H. Kishihara K. Mizzen L. Minden M. Pawson A. Mak T.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5Adachi M. Sekiya M. Isobe M. Kumura Y. Ogita Z.-I. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Yachi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Williams S. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15340-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). HePTP belongs to a subgroup of PTPases with two other members, STEP (7Lombroso P.J. Murdoch G. Lerner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and PCPTP1 (8Shiozuka K. Watanabe Y. Ikeda T. Hashimoto S. Kawashima H. Gene. 1995; 162: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Sharma E. Lombroso P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 49-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast to HePTP, the other two enzymes are not expressed in hematopoietic cells but mainly in the central nervous system: STEP mainly in striatum (7Lombroso P.J. Murdoch G. Lerner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and PCPTP1 particularly in cerebellum (8Shiozuka K. Watanabe Y. Ikeda T. Hashimoto S. Kawashima H. Gene. 1995; 162: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Like PCPTP1 and the 46-kDa isoform of STEP, HePTP consists of a single PTPase domain that occupies the C-terminal 3/4 of the enzyme and is preceded by an ∼80-amino acid noncatalytic N terminus. As might be expected from the lack of putative transmembrane sequences or other recognizable targeting motifs, immunofluorescence microscopy indicates that HePTP is located exclusively in the cytosol in RBL mast cells (10Sweiter M. Berenstein E.H. Swaim W.D. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21902-21906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Jurkat T cells. 2M. Saxena, S. Williams, and T. Mustelin, unpublished observation. 2M. Saxena, S. Williams, and T. Mustelin, unpublished observation. The biological function of HePTP has remained elusive. A potential role in cell proliferation or differentiation was suggested by the finding that the HePTP gene is located at 1q32.1 (11Zanke B. Squire J. Griesser H. Henry M. Suzuki H. Patterson B. Minden M. Mak T.W. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1994; 8: 236-244PubMed Google Scholar) on the long arm of chromosome 1, which is often found in extra copies (trisomy) in bone marrow cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (12Fonatsch C. Haase D. Freund M. Bartels H. Tesch H. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1991; 56: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Mamaev N. Mamaeva S.E. Pavlova V. Patterson D. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1988; 35: 21-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a disease characterized by reduced hematopoiesis. In contrast, deletions of 1q32 have been reported in non-Hodkin lymphomas and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (14Mitelman F. Kaneko Y. Trent J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1991; 58: 1503-1579Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings suggest that excess HePTP may correlate with reduced proliferation (in myelodysplasia) and loss of HePTP with increased cell proliferation and/or survival. Amplification and overexpression of HePTP has also been reported in a case of myelogenous leukemia (11Zanke B. Squire J. Griesser H. Henry M. Suzuki H. Patterson B. Minden M. Mak T.W. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1994; 8: 236-244PubMed Google Scholar). A connection with lymphoid proliferation is also supported by the finding that the HePTP gene is transcriptionally activated in T cells treated with interleukin-2 (15Adachi M. Sekiya M. Ishino M. Sasaki H. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Yachi A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although mRNA levels increased severalfold upon stimulation of normal mouse lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin, lipopolysaccharide, concanavalin A, or anti-CD3 (4Zanke B. Suzuki H. Kishihara K. Mizzen L. Minden M. Pawson A. Mak T.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the HePTP protein was present in resting cells, and its amount increased only moderately. Finally, HePTP has been reported to become phosphorylated on tyrosine in RBL-2H3 mast cells stimulated through their FcεRI (10Sweiter M. Berenstein E.H. Swaim W.D. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21902-21906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We recently reported that transient expression of HePTP in T cells caused a clear reduction in antigen receptor-induced transcriptional activation of a reporter gene driven by a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)/activator protein-1 (AP-1) element taken from the interleukin-2 gene promoter (6Saxena M. Williams S. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15340-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, a catalytically inactive C270S mutant of HePTP had no effect, suggesting that the PTPase activity of HePTP was required for inhibition. We have continued this work and have found that HePTP inhibits NFAT/AP-1 activation, and thereby the entire 5′ interleukin-2 promoter, by dephosphorylating the Erk MAP kinase. Specificity for this substrate is the result of a physical association between HePTP and Erk mediated by the noncatalytic N terminus of HePTP. This region also bound the p38 MAP kinase but not the N-terminal c-Jun kinases Jnk1 and Jnk2 or other signaling proteins. We also show that HePTP is a substrate for Erk and p38, and we identify the sites of phosphorylation and effects of phosphorylation on the association between HePTP and these kinases. Most antibodies and plasmids were as described before (6Saxena M. Williams S. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol.

The HePTP fragments ΔN (amino acids 92–339), N ter (amino acids 1–92), N1 (amino acids 1–40), N2 (amino acids 10–55), and N3 (amino acids 30–80) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers tailed with NheI and NdeI sites and the HePTP cDNA as a template. The resulting fragments were then subcloned into the pGEX-4T-3 vector and verified by sequencing. The GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified with glutathione-Sepharose using standard techniques as before (6Saxena M. Williams S. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol.

Luciferase reporter constructs in the pGL2 promoter vector (Promega) containing multiple copies of NF-κB (−211 to −192, 8 times), Oct (−97 to −64, 7 times), or the promoters of the c-fos and c-jun genes were a kind gift from T.

Anti-phospho-Erk and anti-phospho-Mek were purchased from Promega and New England Biolabs. As described earlier (6Saxena M. Williams S. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol.

Mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Jurkat T leukemia cells and two variants of this cell line, JCaM1.6, which lacks Lck (17Straus D.B. Weiss A.

These cells were transiently transfected with a total of 5–10 μg of DNA by electroporation at 950 microfarads and 240 V as before. Empty vector was added to control samples to make a constant amount of DNA in each sample. Luciferase assays were done as described in detail before (6Saxena M. Williams S. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J.

All immunoblots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-HePTP protein phosphorylated in vitro by the bound kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP was resolved on 10% SDS gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter, and the phosphorylated band was excised and digested with TPCK-treated trypsin as described in detail by Luo et al. (21Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 921-923PubMed Google Scholar). A crucial step in the initiation of an immune response is the production of cytokines by T cells challenged with properly presented antigen (22Altman A. Coggeshall K.M. Mustelin T. Adv. Immunol. 1990; 48: 227-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T cell antigen receptor-induced activation of the interleukin-2 gene is the result of the coordinated action of several transcription factors (23Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 24Rooney J.W. Sun Y.-L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), including a trimeric complex consisting of a NFAT family protein (25Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar) and an AP-1 dimer (26Foletta V.C. Segal D.H. Cohen D.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 27Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar) of Fos and Jun family proteins, with some assistance from octamer-binding proteins (Oct) and NF-κB. Although these proteins operate in a synergistic manner, they can be measured separately using their target DNA elements coupled to a reporter gene. When HePTP was expressed in Jurkat T cells together with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the 5′ interleukin-2 promoter, the activation of this reporter was reduced to 58.1 ± 9.3% (n = 9). In contrast, expression of the catalytically inactive mutant HePTP-C270S or two other PTPases, SHP2 and TCPTP, did not affect the activation of the reporter gene although being expressed at similar levels. The inhibition by HePTP was not as pronounced as its effect on a reporter gene driven by a subregion of the interleukin-2 promoter, one of the NFAT/AP-1 response elements, which was inhibited by more than 80% (6Saxena M. Williams S. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15340-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This discrepancy is probably explained by the minimal effects of HePTP on luciferase reporter constructs driven by Oct or NF-κB (not shown). Together, these results further support the notion that HePTP may play a role in antigen-induced T cell activation and suggests that HePTP dephosphorylates some signaling molecule in the pathways that lead from the antigen receptor to the activation of the NFAT/AP-1 response elements in the interleukin-2 gene. Therefore, we decided to examine several receptor-proximal signaling steps upstream of this transcription factor complex. First, we measured the two types of MAP kinases known to be involved in AP-1 activation in T cells, Erk and Jnk (27Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar, 28Whitehurst C.E. Geppert T.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1020-1029PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were transiently co-transfected with epitope-tagged Erk2 together with HePTP, HePTP-C270S, TCPTP,or SHP2. After stimulation of the cells, the catalytic activity of the kinases was measured. These experiments consistently revealed that the antigen receptor-induced activation of Erk was significantly reduced by HePTP. In cells stimulated for different periods of time with anti-CD3ε (Fig.1 a), the inhibition by HePTP was seen at all time points but most clearly at 2–5 min, coinciding with the peak of Erk activity. Similar results were also obtained in Zap-70-deficient P116 cells (18Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) co-transfected with Zap-70, except that the effects of both wild-type HePTP and HePTP-C270S were even stronger (Fig. 1 b), presumably because of the lower levels of endogenous HePTP in these cells.2 HePTP also blocked interleukin-2 promoter activation more efficiently in these cells (not shown). Thus, the effect of transfected HePTP correlates inversely with the amount of endogenous HePTP, suggesting that the observed inhibition of MAP kinase represents the normal function of HePTP. In agreement with the notion that HePTP inhibits the activation of the interleukin-2 gene by reducing the magnitude and duration of Erk activation, we observed that expression of Erk2 plus an activated mutant (29Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) of Mek, the upstream activator of Erk, augmented interleukin-2 promoter activation and increased its sensitivity to HePTP (Fig. 1 c). As a control, co-expression of activated Mkk6 plus p38 kinases did not affect the interleukin-2 reporter or its inhibition by HePTP (not shown). Furthermore, the activation of another gene known to be up-regulated, in part, through Erk-mediated phosphorylation of the Elk-1 transcription factor (30Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), c-fos, was also reduced in T cells overexpressing HePTP but not in cells expressing the inactive HePTP-C270S (not shown). Together, all these results indicate that HePTP reduces the activation of Erkin vivo. This notion is supported by the opposite effect of catalytically inactive HePTP-C270S in the same assays. To ascertain that the observed inhibition by HePTP was not limited to exogenous transfected MAP kinase, we next utilized the JCaM1 cell line, which is unresponsive to T cell antigen receptor stimulation because of lack of Lck kinase (17Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Transient expression of Lck (or Syk) restores responsiveness (20Williams S. Couture C. Gilman J. Jascur T. Deckert M. Altman A. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). JCaM1 cells were transfected with Lck together with HePTP, HePTP-C270S, or control PTPases and used for analysis of antigen receptor-induced appearance of activated and phosphorylated MAP kinases by immunoblotting with activation-specific antibodies. Fig.1 d shows that HePTP reduced the appearance of phospho-Erk1 and -2, while at the same time and in the same cells, not having any effects on activation of Mek or the receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (Fig. 1e), including the ζ chain of the T cell antigen receptor and Zap-70 (verified by immunoprecipitation). Additional immunoblots of the same samples showed that the expression of endogenous Erk and Mek, as well as transfected Lck and PTPases, was equal in all samples. On longer exposures, it was also noted that the catalytically inactive HePTP-C270S elevated the amount of phospho-Erk in the resting cells. Thus, HePTP readily inhibits endogenous MAP kinase, and the catalytically inactive HePTP-C270S acts as a dominant negative reducing the action of endogenous HePTP. The MAP kinase pathway can also be efficiently activated by phorbol esters, which bypass all receptor-induced proximal tyrosine phosphorylation events by activating the Raf kinase through protein kinase C (31Siegel J.N. Klausner R.D. Rapp U.R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18472-18477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Izquierdo M. Bowden S. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When tagged Erk2 was expressed in JCaM1 cells together with HePTP and the cells were stimulated with 20 nm phorbol myristate acetate, the activation of the MAP kinase was profoundly inhibited compared with cells expressing Erk2 alone (Fig. 1 f). In contrast to cells stimulated by anti-CD3 (lanes 2,4, and 6), phorbol ester-induced MAP kinase activation did not require expression of Lck. Control blots confirmed that the immunoprecipitates contained equal amounts of Erk2 and that equal amounts of HePTP and Lck were expressed in the transfectants (Fig. 1 f, lower panels). Because HePTP is specific for Tyr(P), this result supports the conclusion that HePTP does not block MAP kinase activation by dephosphorylating receptor-proximal tyrosine phosphorylation events. Rather, these data suggest a more direct effect on Erk. Having found that HePTP had no effects on the phosphorylation of Mek in the same cells where Erk phosphorylation was reduced, we asked if HePTP acts directly on phospho-Erk. First, we phosphorylated recombinant kinase-inactive Erk1 at the activation loop threonine and tyrosine residues using active recombinant Mek and treated the resulting phospho-Erk with recombinant HePTP at 37 °C. As shown in Fig.2 a, the Tyr(P) content of Erk decreased detectably within 10–30 s and was very low by 1–5 min. Phosphoamino acid analysis of similarly treated Erk1 phosphorylated by Mek in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP revealed that HePTP caused a rapid loss of phosphate from tyrosine without hydrolyzing phosphothreonine (Fig. 2 b). Furthermore, a brief incubation at 37 °C of active recombinant Erk with HePTP resulted in a total loss of its kinase activity (Fig. 2 c). In contrast, GST, HePTP-C270S, or SHP2 had no effects. Using 10 ng (150 fmol) of recombinant Erk, we found that 10 ng (150 fmol, 7.5 nm) or more of HePTP caused a complete inactivation of Erk within the first minute of the assay, whereas the addition of 1 ng (15 fmol) of HePTP had insignificant (<10%) effects even during a 30-min assay (Fig.2 d). This result suggests that HePTP acts on Erk at a 1:1 stoichiometry, perhaps by binding and primarily dephosphorylating only the bound kinase molecules. To directly test the possibility that HePTP binds Erk, we used GST fusion proteins of HePTP, HePTP-C270S, or SHP2 and found that both HePTP and HePTP-C270S readily bound Erk (Fig.3 a) in lysates of resting T cells or cells treated with pervanadate (to maximize tyrosine phosphorylation (33Couture C. Songyang Z. Jascur T. Williams S. Tailor P. Cantley L.C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24880-24884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). The precipitates also reacted strongly with antibodies to another MAP kinase, p38. In contrast, neither Jnk1 nor Jnk2 bound, and control GST, GST-SHP2 (Fig. 3 a), or GST-TCPTP (not shown) did not precipitate any of these kinases. Immunoblotting with antibodies to the 36–38-kDa LAT (34Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar) or to other signaling molecules gave negative results. The Erk and p38 that bound active HePTP did not contain Tyr(P) and were catalytically inactive. In contrast, Erk and p38 bound to inactive HePTP-C270S from pervanadate-treated cells were phosphorylated on tyrosine and enzymatically highly active against myelin basic protein or GST-ATF2, a preferred substrate for p38 kinase (Fig. 3 b). In these reactions, GST-HePTP was also phosphorylated by the bound Erk and p38. HePTP also co-immunoprecipitated with p38 from untreated or activated Jurkat T cells (Fig. 3 c). Co-immunoprecipitation of HePTP and Erk was not as clean because of nonspecific binding of Erk to Sepharose beads coated with irrelevant immunoglobulin (Fig.3 d). We conclude that HePTP specifically associates with Erk and p38 MAP kinases. The finding that HePTP associates with both Erk and p38, but not with Jnk, prompted us to study the direct effects of HePTP on the kinase activity of p38 in vitro and on the activation of p38 and Jnk in intact cells. First, we used 10 ng of recombinant active p38 kinase, added 100 ng of GST-HePTP, GST-HePTP-C270S, control GST, or GST-SHP2, and incubated the samples with [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 4 a, active HePTP inhibited p38 profoundly, whereas the inactive C270S mutant, GST, and the control SHP2 PTPase lacked effects. Next, we co-transfected HA-tagged p38 or Jnk2 with empty vector, with HePTP, or with HePTP-C270S. Two days later, the cells were stimulated with a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs (as neither mAb alone activates these kinases). After 15–20 min at 37 °C, the cells were lysed, the tagged kinases were immunoprecipitated, and their activity was measured with GST-ATF2 or GST-c-Jun-N as substrates. These assays revealed that HePTP reduced both the basal activity of p38 and its further activation (Fig. 4 b) but not the activation of Jnk2 (Fig. 4 c). The cpm in the GST-ATF2 band were reduced inlane 5 compared with lane 3 by 55% and inlane 6 compared with lane 4 by 78%. The expression of p38 was difficult to evaluate due the similarity in size with HePTP but at least did not appear to be any less in lanes 5 and 6. Jnk2 was expressed at relatively low levels but equally in all samples. We conclude that HePTP inhibits p38, but not Jnk, in intact cells. The region of HePTP that binds Erk and p38 was first mapped to its noncatalytic N-terminal 92 amino acids. A GST fusion protein of HePTP lacking this region (GST-ΔN) failed to bind any Tyr(P)-containing proteins, Erk, or p38 (Fig. 5 a) in lysates of Jurkat T cells. In contrast, a GST fusion protein containing only the N-terminal 92 amino acids of HePTP (GST-N ter) bound both Erk and p38 (Fig. 5 b). To determine the binding region more precisely, we made three smaller constructs encompassing amino acids 1–40, 10–55, 30–80, respectively. These three GST fusion proteins were incubated with cell lysates, washed extensively, and immunoblotted for the presence of Erk and p38. As shown in Fig. 5 c, the two first fragments bound both Erk and p38 readily, whereas the third did not. We conclude that the binding site must reside within amino acids 10–30, perhaps extending into the 30–40 region, which is not sufficient for binding by itself. This region also contains two potential phosphorylation sites for a proline-directed kinase (such as Erk), Ser-72, and Thr-45. Because HePTP was readily phosphorylated on both serine and threonine by the bound Erk and p38 (Fig. 3 b) and by recombinant Erk2 (Fig.6 a) or p38 (not shown), we mutated these residues to alanines and examined their phosphorylation by tryptic peptide mapping, which revealed that both peptides containing Ser(P) (peptides 1 and 2) contained Ser-72, whereas Thr-45 was the phosphorylated residue in peptides 3–5 (Fig. 6b). These peptides were also seen in tryptic peptide maps of HePTP from metabolically 32Pi-labeled T cells but were missing in a HePTP-T45A/S72A mutant (not shown). Thus, the noncatalytic N terminus of HePTP binds Erk and p38 and is phosphorylated at Ser-72 and Thr-45 by these kinases. The phosphorylation of the N terminus of HePTP by the Erk or p38 kinases introduces the possibility of a regulatory role of this event. Measurement of the catalytic activity of HePTP revealed a small decrease in activity upon phosphorylation by Erk (not shown). This decrease is presently of questionable significance. Instead, we addressed the possibility that phosphorylation regulates the physical association between HePTP and Erk or p38. Because a GST-N ter protein having both the T45A and S72A mutations still bound Erk and p38 as readily as the wild-type GST-N ter protein (Fig. 5 b), it seems that the hydroxyl groups of Thr-45 and Ser-72 or their phosphorylation are not required for binding of Erk or p38. To test the opposite, namely that phosphorylation is involved in dissociation of the kinases, we incubated HePTP-Erk complexes in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ at 37 °C and measured the release of HePTP. These experiments utilized catalytically active GST-Erk2 adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose with bound HA-tagged HePTP-C270S from transfected Jurkat T cells and resulted in a time-dependent dissociation of HePTP from the beads (Fig. 6 c). Thus, the N terminus of HePTP binds Erk and p38 but may release them upon phosphorylation. Curiously, both phosphorylation sites are outside the minimal necessary binding site for Erk and p38, but their phosphorylation could influence the conformation of the binding site. To study the impact of phosphorylation of HePTP at Thr-45 and Ser-72 in intact cells, we generated a mutant in which both residues were replaced by alanine residues. The mutant, HePTP-T45A/S72A, was included in a co-transfection experiment similar to that in Fig. 1 f using JCaM1 cells. As shown in Fig.6 d, wild-type HePTP reduced the anti-CD3-induced activity of Erk2 to about half, whereas HePTP-C270S augmented it. In contrast, HePTP-T45A/S72A was more efficient than wild-type HePTP and essentially eliminated any increase in MAP kinase activation in the anti-CD3 stimulated cells. Thus, it is clear that phosphorylation of HePTP at Thr-45 and/or Ser-72 is not required for inhibition of MAP kinase. Rather, it seems that phosphorylation has the opposite effect, namely to lessen the inhibitory effect of HePTP. This fits our hypothesis that phosphorylation causes a dissociation of Erk from HePTP; the T45A/S72A mutant would not allow bound Erk to escape, and the inhibition of Erk activation would be stronger. Taken together, our findings show that HePTP, a strictly Tyr(P)-specific protein phosphatase, forms a physical complex through a small region in its unique N terminus with the Erk and p38 MAP kinases. Because HePTP very efficiently dephosphorylates these kinases and inactivates them in vitro, it seems that the physical association serves to position HePTP correctly for this catalysis. The small amount of HePTP required for MAP kinase inactivation in vitro and the reduction in Erk phosphorylation and activity in intact T cells transfected with HePTP indicate that this function of HePTP is physiologically significant. This conclusion is also supported by the finding that HePTP is readily phosphorylated by Erk and p38 at Thr-45 and Ser-72, both of which are phosphorylated in intact cells. Finally, very similar conclusions were recently drawn using mast cells from mice deficient in HePTP. 3B. Zanke, personal communication. Together these observations indicate that the role of HePTP is to negatively regulate the Erk and p38 MAP kinases in hematopoietic cells. Whether the related PTPases STEP and PCPTP1 carry out this task in other cell types remains to be determined. Both share an N-terminal sequence with a high degree of homology to the Erk/p38 binding region of HePTP. It is well established that MAP kinases are the targets for dual-specificity phosphatases (35Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 36Rohan P.J.

Biol. 1998; 9: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in T cells; particularly, the Pac1 phosphatase (36Rohan P.J. Davis P. Moskaluk C.A. Kearns M. Krutzsch H. Siewbenlist U. Kelly K. Science. 1993; 259: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In contrast to HePTP (4Zanke B. Suzuki H. Kishihara K. Mizzen L. Minden M. Pawson A. Mak T.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Saxena M. Williams S. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15340-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), however, these enzymes are not present in resting T cells but are induced and synthesized some 30–60 min after receptor ligation (35Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 36Rohan P.J. Davis P. Moskaluk C.A. Kearns M. Krutzsch H. Siewbenlist U. Kelly K. Science. 1993; 259: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, they are unlikely to be responsible for suppression of MAP kinases in resting T lymphocytes or during early time points of T cell activation. It has been shown also in other cell types that the inactivation of MAP kinases precedes the induction of dual-specificity phosphatases and that a cytosolic PTPase is involved (38Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 39Gopalbhai K. Meloche S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mating pheromone-induced activation of the MAP kinases Fus3p and Kss1p is tightly regulated by the concerted action of the dual-specificity protein phosphatase Msg5p and the conventional PTPases Ptp2p and Ptp3p (40Zhan X.-L. Deschenes R.J. Guan K.-L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1690-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this system, the latter are responsible for the basal suppression of the MAP kinases and for terminating their ligand-induced activation. In contrast, the dual-specificity phosphatase is encoded by an inducible gene, and the role of the enzyme is primarily to dephosphorylate the MAP kinases at later time points (“recovery”). Our findings suggest that a mammalian PTPase, HePTP, is a functional homologue of Ptp2p and Ptp3p and is responsible for basal dephosphorylation and control at early time points. Lymphocyte activation is initiated by the action of several protein-tyrosine kinases (41Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Isakov N. Altman A. Science. 1990; 247: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 42Mustelin T. Immunity. 1994; 1: 351-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and is very likely to be negatively regulated by a number of PTPases (43Mustelin T. Brockdorff J. Gjörloff-Wingren A. Tailor P. Han S. Wang X. Saxena M. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 1066-1096Crossref Google Scholar). Only one such PTPase is currently known, namely SHP1 (44D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 45Pani G. Fischer K.-D. Mlinaric-Rascan I. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which dephosphorylates receptor-associated signaling molecules. Here we show that HePTP functions at a distinct step to negatively regulate lymphocyte activation. In contrast to SHP1, HePTP has a high degree of specificity for Erk and perhaps p38 MAP kinases and does not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation events upstream of these kinases. This specificity is due, in part, to a strong physical association of HePTP with Erk and p38, an interaction that is constitutive and occurs through the unphosphorylated N terminus of HePTP. We suggest that upon activation of Erk by Mek, the activated Erk either rapidly phosphorylates Thr-45 and Ser-72, dissociates (perhaps also because of other mechanisms), and escapes into the nucleus to phosphorylate its nuclear substrates. A fraction of the activated Erk molecules, however, are rapidly inactivated by the bound HePTP. As determined by immunofluorescence, HePTP appears to remain exclusively cytosolic (Ref. 10Sweiter M.

Instead, these are later inactivated by the nuclear dual-specificity phosphatases, which are absent in resting T cells but are induced within 30–60 min of T cell activation. This sequential phosphatase model (Fig. 7) provides a flexible mechanism for the regulation and fine-tuning of MAP kinases, which function as crucial signal integration and decision points in T cell activation as well as in growth and stress responses in many other cell types. Our model predicts a potential role for HePTP in positive selection of T cells in the thymus (46Alberola-Ila J. Forbush K.A. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M.

https://openalex.org/W2023775801,"Enhanced osmotic water permeability has been observed in Xenopus oocytes expressing cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Subsequent studies have shown that CFTR activates an endogenous water permeability in oocytes, but that CFTR itself is not the water channel. Here, we show CFTR-dependent activation of endogenous water permeability in normal but not in cystic fibrosis human airway epithelial cells. Cell volume was measured by novel confocal x-z laser scanning microscopy. Glycerol uptake and antisense studies suggest CFTR-dependent regulation of aquaporin 3 (AQP3) water channels in airway epithelial cells. Regulatory interaction was confirmed by coexpression of CFTR and AQP3 cloned from human airways inXenopus oocytes and of CFTR and rat AQP3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These findings indicate that CFTR is a regulator of AQP3 in airway epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062742229,"Calcium-sensing receptors are present in membranes as dimers that can be reduced to monomers with sufhydryl reagents. All studies were carried out on the human calcium-sensing receptor tagged at the carboxyl terminus with green fluorescent protein (hCaR-GFP) to permit identification and localization of expressed proteins. Truncations containing either the extracellular agonist binding domain plus transmembrane helix 1 (ECD/TMH1-GFP) or the transmembrane domain plus the intracellular carboxyl terminus (TMD/carboxyl terminus-GFP) were used to identify the dimerization domain. ECD/TMH1-GFP was a dimer in the absence of reducing reagents, whereas TMD/carboxyl-terminal GFP was a monomer in the absence or presence of reducing agents, suggesting that dimerization occurs via the ECD. To identify the residue(s) involved in dimerization within the ECD, cysteine → serine point mutations were made in residues that are conserved between hCaR and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Mutations at positions 60 and 131 were expressed at levels comparable to wild type in HEK 293 cells, had minimal effects on hCaR function, and did not eliminate dimerization, whereas mutations at positions 101 and 236 greatly decreased receptor expression and resulted in significant amounts of monomer in the absence of reducing agents. The double point mutant hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP was expressed more robustly than either C101S or C236S and covalent dimerization was eliminated. hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP had a decreased affinity for extracellular Ca2+ and slower response kinetics upon increases or decreases in agonist concentration. These results suggest that covalent, disulfide bond-mediated dimerization of the calcium-sensing receptor contributes to stabilization of the ECD and to acceleration of the transitions between inactive and active receptor conformations.

Although the physiological relevance of CaR oligomerization is not known, a recent study has demonstrated CaR dimers can be isolated from kidney epithelium (13Ward D.T. Brown E.M. Harris H.W. J.

Preincubation of kidney epithelial membranes with agonists (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Gd3+) protected CaR dimers from the actions of reducing agents, suggesting the presence of conformationally sensitive disulfide bonds. Additional evidence for CaR dimerization comes from the dominant negative effect observed when CaR bearing an inactivating mutation (R185Q) was coexpressed with wild type receptor in HEK 293 cells (14Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol.

The region critical to mGluR5 receptor dimerization has been localized to the first 17 kDa of the amino terminus by limited proteolysis (15Romano C. Yang W.-L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol.

Opiate receptors undergo agonist-mediated monomerization, which is a prelude to receptor sequestration (20Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol.

Interestingly, some opiate agonists are not capable of mediating monomerization, and this may account for their longer lasting physiological effects. Dimerization is required for normal functioning of β-adrenergic receptors (34Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

In this report, we demonstrate that both CaR and a truncated construct consisting of the extracellular domain plus transmembrane helix 1 exist as dimers in the absence of reducing agents and that disulfide bond reduction causes a shift to the monomeric form of either full-length CaR or the extracellular domain truncation. We have identified cysteine residues that eliminate CaR dimerization by making cysteine → serine point mutations in each of the cysteine residues within the first 17 kDa of the extracellular domain conserved between CaR and the mGluRs, beginning at the amino terminus. We found that the double point mutant hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP can be observed on SDS gels as a monomer in the absence of reducing agents. Finally, we demonstrate that hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP is functional when heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells but displays a decreased affinity for agonist and significantly slower kinetics of activation and deactivation. Human CaR (hCaR) in pBluescript was obtained from Dr. J. Garrett (NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). The rat β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) was obtained from Dr. David Yue (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University). GFP fusion proteins were generated using pCDNA3.1 containing GFP in each of three frames (CLONTECH). Restriction enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and New England Biolabs. All PCRs were performed withPfuI polymerase (Stratagene) using 94, 57, and 72 °C as denaturing, annealing, and elongation temperatures, respectively. All constructs were confirmed by restriction digestion and automated sequencing. hCaR with a carboxyl-terminal fusion to EGFP (CLONTECH) was constructed as described previously (37Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). hCaR with a carboxyl-terminal fusion to the FLAG epitope was prepared by replacing EGFP in the hCaR-GFP construct by inverse PCR (5′ primer, GATGACGACAAGTAAAGCGGCCGCGACTCT; 3′ primer, GTCCTTGTAGTCTGAATTCACTACGTTTTCTGTAACAGT). The ECD/TMH1-GFP construct was prepared by generating a PCR product containing a BamHI site after the first hCaR transmembrane domain (5′ primer, CGCTATTACCATGGTGATGCGG; 3′ primer, CGCGGATCCTCGGTTGGTGGCCTT) using hCaR as a template. After amplification, the product was cut withXhoI-BamHI and subcloned in frame into pEGFPN3 (CLONTECH). A two-step cloning process was used to generate TMD/Cterm-GFP. First, a PCR product containing the seven transmembrane domains and the carboxyl-terminal domain of hCaR was subcloned into the XhoI-BamHI sites of pEGFPN3 (5′ primer, CGCCGCCTCGAGGAGATCGAGTTTCTG; 3′ primer, CGCGGATCCCACTACGTTTTCTGT). In a second step, a PCR product containing the Kozak sequence and the CaR signal peptide was produced (5′ primer, CGCTATTACCATGGTGATGCGG; 3′ primer, CGCCGCCTCGAGCCCGTAGGCAGAGGT) using hCaR as the template and subcloned with NheI-XhoI into the product of the first cloning step. Point mutations converting cysteine residues into serine (C60S, C101S, C131S, and C236S) were individually introduced into the hCaR-GFP construct by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (38Fisher C.L. Pei G.K. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 570Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The double point mutation (C101S/C236S) was made by performing a second round of mutagenesis in the background of the C101S point mutant. The β2AR-GFP construct was generated by PCR with BamHI sites at the ends, followed by insertion into pEGFPN1 (CLONTECH). HEK 293 cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (at 37 °C and 5% CO2). For functional studies, cells were transfected in 24-well plates with 0.1 μg of each construct using Effectene (Qiagen). Eighteen hours later, they were plated on collagen-coated coverslips and kept in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C until use (usually after 48–72 h). For membrane preparations, cells were split into 100-mm dishes and transfected the next day with 1 μg of each construct using Effectene (Qiagen). Some constructs were also stably transfected with Effectene after linearization withDraIII. Cells were kept in medium containing 300 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Colonies were selected after 3 weeks, and clones were confirmed by cell fluorescence (GFP) and CaR activity. Two days after transfection, HEK 293 cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline-EDTA (1 mm) and pelleted by brief centrifugation at 500 rpm (4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors (14Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was sedimented at 100,000 ×g for 10 min (4 °C). The membrane pellet was solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with 1 μg each of the appropriately tagged constructs. Crude homogenates (250 μg) or membrane protein (200 μg) was precipitated with either 5 μl of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or 3 μl of anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (CLONTECH) as described in Ref. 12Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar. The immunoreactive species were eluted from the protein A complex with electrophoresis sample buffer (containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 25 °C for 30 min and detected by Western blotting. Linear gradient (4–15%) SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) were loaded with 2–12 μg of membrane protein. Some samples were reduced in 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol in SDS sample buffer for 30 min at room temperature prior to gel loading. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and blocked with 20% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 h. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at a 1:2000 dilution or polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) at 1:2500) and subsequently with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a 1:100,000 dilution). The Blaze Chemiluminescence System (Pierce) was used for detection, and blots were scanned and processed with Adobe Photoshop. Transfected cells were identified by viewing GFP fluorescence with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter (595 nm emission wavelength). Cells were loaded with 0.5 μm fura-2-AM (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 37 °C in a solution containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, 0.83 mmNa2HPO4, 0.17 mmNaH2PO4, and 25 mm mannose, plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. After the loading period, the coverslip was mounted in an imaging chamber (Warner Instruments) having both a top and bottom coverslip, and washed with a solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.55 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The cells were excited at 340/380 nm (emission wavelength 510 nm) at 8-s intervals, and selected regions were recorded on a Universal imaging system based on the MetaFluor software package. Background images at the same gain settings used during a particular experiment were obtained on regions of the coverslip devoid of cells. All solutions were osmolality-matched. Variations in extracellular Ca2+ concentration were produced by isosmolar substitution for NaCl. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C). Multiple cells were analyzed from at least three independent transfections (or cell passages for stable cell lines). Data were normalized and averaged as described for each experiment and are presented as the mean ± S.E. Curves were fitted by least squares minimization using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm (NFIT, Island Products, Galveston, TX). Several recent reports suggest that CaR exists in vivo (13Ward D.T. Brown E.M. Harris H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14476-14483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and in heterologously expressed systems (12Bai M. Trivedi S.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in a dimeric form that can be largely converted to the monomer form by treatment with reducing agents such as dithiothreitol, β-mercaptoethanol, or β-mercaptopropanol. We have further characterized dimerization of human CaR by expressing various constructs (truncations and point mutations) in HEK 293 cells. Fig.1 illustrates the control constructs studied: human CaR-FLAG (a) (to permit antibody detection of hCaR) and human CaR-GFP (b). A prominent band estimated at 320–340 kDa was observed in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol for hCaR-FLAG. This was converted to a doublet at 140–160 kDa upon reduction with β-mercaptoethanol. hCaR-GFP presented a greater dispersion of molecular masses in the absence of reducing agents, but upon reduction, there was a prominent doublet at 205–220 kDa (molecular mass of hCaR plus the 27-kDa GFP tag). All samples were exposed to 10 mm iodoacetamide during homogenization to minimize formation of nonspecific disulfide bonds during membrane isolation. Pretreatment with iodoacetamide reduced the dispersion in the molecular masses of the oligomeric hCaR complexes and promoted a more complete conversion to the monomer form upon reduction with β-mercaptoethanol, also noted in a recent report (12Bai M.

Similar conversions of dimer to monomer occur upon reduction of either hCaR-FLAG or hCaR-GFP, suggesting that the GFP tag does not affect the process. All further studies were performed on the GFP-tagged receptor, because it permits rapid screening of expressed clones, cellular localization of mutated receptors, and crude estimates of expression levels to be made prior to functional studies. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that carboxyl-terminal fusion of GFP to hCaR does not alter the functional properties of the receptor (dose/response relationship, desensitization, and subcellular localization) (37Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we note that GFP does not alter hCaR dimerization. To determine the domain involved in hCaR dimerization, two hCaR truncations were examined, one containing only the ECD plus TMH1 (ECD/TMH1-GFP) and another comprising only the seven transmembrane helices plus the carboxyl terminus (TMD/Cterm-GFP). Both truncations were tagged at their carboxyl termini with GFP and were localized to both intracellular and plasma membranes of transiently transfected HEK 293 cells. Fig. 2 illustrates a representative Western blot. hCaR-GFP (Fig. 2 a) and ECD/TMH1-GFP (b) are present predominantly as dimers in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol. Including β-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer caused a substantial shift to the monomer form of hCaR-GFP and a quantitative shift to the monomer form of ECD/TMH1-GFP. Western blots of membranes from cells stably transfected with TMD/Cterm-GFP (Fig. 2 c) revealed that the expressed protein was present in the monomer form in the absence and presence of reducing agents. There was some high molecular mass material evident in the nonreduced sample; this is most likely due to oxidation of cysteines within the cytoplasmic tail during sample preparation and is not prevented by iodoacetamide treatment, as has been noted previously (12Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These experiments localize disulfide bond-mediated dimerization in hCaR to the ECD. Studies on mGluR5 indicated that dimerization was eliminated by cleavage of the first 17 kDa of the amino terminus (15Romano C. Yang W.-L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We therefore began by individually mutating to serine the four cysteine residues of hCaR that are present within the first 17 kDa of the amino terminus (at amino acid positions 60, 101, 131, and 236), which are conserved between CaRs and mGluRs. Whereas single cysteine → serine point mutations at these positions did not eliminate dimerization (Fig. 3,a–d), single point mutations at Cys101 and Cys236 did increase the amount of monomer observed in the nonreduced samples. Furthermore, as is apparent in Fig. 3, expression of Cys101 or Cys236 was weak compared with a single point mutation at Cys60 or Cys131 (all lanes were loaded with equal amounts of membrane protein). We therefore made the double point mutation hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP. This mutated receptor expressed more robustly than either of the single point mutations, and was present in the monomer state on Western blots in the absence or presence of reducing agents (Fig. 3 e). Direct comparison of C101S, C236S, and C101S/C236S (Fig.4) at higher protein levels confirms the requirement for both point mutations to eliminate significant hCaR dimerization in the absence of reducing agents.Figure 4Dimer/monomer comparisons for C101S, C236S, and C101S/C236S mutations. Membranes were prepared and run as in Fig. 3. Samples were hCaR(C101S)-GFP (12 μg/lane) (a), hCaR(C236S)-GFP (12 μg/lane) (b), and hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP (5 μg/lane) (c).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To ascertain whether hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP was correctly folded and processed, we determined its cellular localization by assessing GFP fluorescence (localization was comparable to that of wild type hCaR (37Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), data not shown), its ability to form noncovalent dimers, and its ability to activate Gq, resulting in increases in intracellular Ca2+ (described below). hCaR(C101S/C236S)-FLAG and hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP were transiently coexpressed in HEK 293 cells, and membranes were isolated. Immunoprecipitation was performed with either the anti-FLAG or anti-GFP antibodies, and Western blots of the precipitated proteins were probed with the anti-GFP antibody. Illustrated in Fig.5 are the results of such an experiment. The control lane (Fig. 5 a) illustrates membranes from the co-transfected HEK 293 cells (reduced with β-mercaptoethanol) probed with the anti-GFP antibody. Fig. 5 b illustrates the results from immunoprecipitations with either the anti-FLAG (F) or anti-GFP (G) antibody. Precipitation with either antibody resulted in the appearance of anti-GFP-reactive protein of the correct molecular weight (monomeric hCaR-GFP) on the Western blot. To confirm that these results signify specific noncovalent dimerization of hCaR(C101S/C236S)-FLAG and hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP, two control experiments were performed, as illustrated in Fig. 5, c andd. First, membranes isolated from HEK 293 cells transfected with hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP were immunoprecipitated with either the anti-FLAG (F) or anti-GFP (G) antibody, and the Western blot was probed with the anti-GFP antibody (Fig.5 c). A second control utilized membranes isolated from cells transfected with both hCaR-FLAG and β2AR-GFP (which should not associate with hCaR). Immunoprecipitations were performed with either the anti-FLAG (F) or anti-GFP (G) antibody, and blots were probed with the anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 5 d). In both cases, precipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody did not result in any anti-GFP-reactive protein on the Western blot, validating the specificity of the immunoprecipitation process. These results suggest that hCaR(C101S/C236S)-FLAG and hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP form noncovalent dimers when coexpressed in HEK 293 cells. The functional consequences of cysteine → serine mutations were examined for those receptor mutations that expressed robustly in HEK 293 cells, namely, C60S, C131S, and C101S/C236S.

A closely related human KCNK7-A subunit has been cloned. KCNK7 displays an intriguing GLE sequence in its filter region instead of the G(Y/F/L)G sequence, which is considered to be the K+ channel signature. This subunit is alternatively spliced and gives rise to the shorter forms KCNK7-B and -C. None of the KCNK7 structures can generate channel activity by itself.

Ionic Channels in Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies have allowed identification and characterization of a great variety of ion channels, which are differentiated first by their selectivity and then by their other biophysical properties, their pharmacology, and their regulation (2Hille B. Catterall W.A. Siegel G.J. Agranoff B.W. Albers R.W. Molinoff P.B. Basic Neurochemistry: Molecular, Cellular, and Medical Aspects. 5th Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 75-95Google Scholar). Recent cloning efforts and analysis of structure-function relationships have now provided a molecular basis for many of the biophysical properties. Thus, the mechanism that determines ion channel selectivity is now fairly well understood for K+ channels (3Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar). K+ selectivity is carried by a structural element called P domain (P for pore-forming). This domain is highly conserved among the three main structural classes of K+ channel subunits with six-transmembrane, four-transmembrane, or two-transmembrane domains (4Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The most recently described family of K+ channels has four transmembrane domains (5Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F.

Members of this family have two pore-forming domains (P1 and P2), an extended extracellular loop between the M1 and P1 domains with a conserved cysteine residue (except for TASK-1), and a short cytoplasmic N-terminal extremity. TWIK-1 has been shown to form covalent homodimers (8Lesage F. Lauritzen I. Duprat F. Reyes R. Fink M. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

Despite a relatively low sequence similarity and different functional properties, these two-P domain K+ channels all produce quasi-instantaneous and noninactivating currents, although the TASK-2 currents displays relatively slow activation kinetics. These new K+ channels are presently classified into three distinct functional subfamilies. TASK-1 and TASK-2 are background K+ channels sensitive to small external pH variations near physiological pH (9Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

TWIK-1 is a weakly inward rectifying K+ channel that is stimulated by PKC and inhibited by internal acidification (7Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The different types of regulations indicate that these K+ channels are probably involved in a great diversity of physiological and pathophysiological roles. More than 40 genes potentially encoding two-P domain K+channel subunits have now been identified in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome (15Bargmann C.I. Science. 1998; 282: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that a large number of two-P domain channels might also exist in mammals. The present paper describes the cloning of two novel mammalian two-P domain channels related to TWIK-1, one of mouse and the other of human origin. A BLAST search using the TWIK K+ channel led to the identification of mouse and human expressed sequence tags (ESTs1; accession numbersW18545 and AA777982). In order to characterize the corresponding full-length cDNAs, called KCNK6 and KCNK7, 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) were performed on adult mouse or human brain cDNAs ligated with adapters as previously (16Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Two antisense primers for 5′-RACE (5′-CTCCTCCAGGGCCTCAGGTGGCAA-3′/5′-GGCCATAAGCAGGAGCAGGTAT-3′ specific to KCNK6 and 5′-AGGCCTTTCCGCCTGGCGAT-3′/5′-GGAAGGTCCCAGGTCCTGCC-3′ specific to KCNK7) and two sense primers for 3′-RACE (5′-TGAGAGCACAGGCCCATGGAGTTT-3′/5′-GCATCCTCACCACCACCGGTTA- 3′ specific to KCNK6 and 5-CTGCGCTGCTGCAGGCAGTT-3′/5′-GCTGGTGCTGTGGGGCCTT-3′ specific to KCNK7) were derived from ESTs W18545 and AA777982. Two successive RACE reactions were performed with a mixture ofTaq (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Pwo (Boehringer Mannheim) DNA polymerases by using anchor primers 5′-TAGAATCGAGGTCGACGGTATC-3′ and 5′-GATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATCGA-3′. The amplified products were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), and three clones of each products were sequenced on both strands (Applied Biosystems model 373A). Primers flanking the KCNK6 and KCNK7-A coding sequences (KCNK6, sense, 5′-CCGGAATTCGCCACCATGGGGAGTCTGAAACC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAAGGTCCCCCAACACGATC-3′; KCNK7-A, sense, 5′-CCGGAATTCGCCGCCATGGGGGGTCTAAGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGCAAGCAGGGGCTTGT-3′) and containing EcoRI orBamHI restriction sites were used to amplify the coding sequences from mouse or human brain cDNA with a low error rate DNA polymerase (Pwo DNA polymerase, Boehringer Mannheim). The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into the pIRES-CD8 expression vector (6Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and sequenced. To exclude sequences errors due to the PCR, products issued from independent PCR experiments were subcloned and sequenced. In the same way, the coding sequences of both splicing forms KCNK7-B and KCNK7-C were amplified with the KCNK7-A sense primer and with the antisense primers: KCNK7-B, 5′-CGCGGATCCCTACCCCTCCCACGCCGT-3′, and KCNK7-C, 5′-CGCGGATCCTCCTAGTCCAGGCTCCTCTTC-3′. Primers flanking the variable region (primer F, 5′-CGTCTACTTCTGCTTCAGCTCG-3′; primer R, 5′-TCAGCAAGCAGGGGCTTGT-3′) were used to amplify the different spliced mRNA forms from human brain cDNA (10 ng) with the low error rate DNA polymerase (Pwo). Fragments were separated by agarose gel (2.5%) electrophoresis, and analysis was carried out by Southern blot with two 32P-labeled oligonucleotides probes (probe 1, 5′-CTACCCCTCCCACGCCGT-3′; probe 2, 5′-GTGCTGAGCGAGCTGAAG-3′). These fragments were subcloned for sequencing. For Northern blot analysis, mouse and human multiple-tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed at 65 or 68 °C in ExpressHyb solution with the 32P-labeled coding sequences of KCNK6 or KCNK7 following the manufacturer's protocol. For reverse transcription-PCR, total RNAs were extracted from mouse tissues with the SNAP total RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I. Fifteen μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies), and 140 of each sample was used as template for PCR amplification (TaqDNA polymerase, Life Technologies) using KCNK6 (nucleotides 12–31, 5′-GAAACCATGGGCCCGATACC-3′, and 366–385, 5′-CAAGGGCTGCATAGACCACA-3′) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH) primers. KCNK6-amplified fragments were transferred onto nylon membranes and then probed with a32P-labeled internal primer (bases 302–323, 5′-GCATCCTCACCACCACCGGTTA-3′). Adult Swiss mice were killed by a transcardial perfusion with 0.9% NaCl followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The brain and retina were postfixed in an ice-cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS solution for 3 h and then immersed overnight at 4 °C in a 20% sucrose/PBS solution. Frozen sections (10 μm) were collected on 3-aminopropylethoxysilane-coated slides and stored at −20 °C. Specific antisense cRNA probes were generated with T7-RNA polymerase (Boehringer), by in vitro transcription using [33P]d-UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN Radiochemicals), from a BamHI-linearized pBluescript SK-plasmid containing an 800-base pair fragment from the 3′-untranslated sequence of KCNK6. Sections were treated using standard procedures (17Salinas M. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Hugnot J.P. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24371-24379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For control experiments, adjacent sections were hybridized with a corresponding sense riboprobe or digested with RNase before hybridization. DNA fragments coding for regions extending from Gln29 to Asn89 and from Glu254 to Pro335 were amplified by PCR and subcloned behind the glutathione S-transferase (GST) coding sequence into the pGEX3x plasmid. The resulting GST-KCNK6 fusion proteins were produced in the BL21 (DE3 pLysS) Escherichia coli strain and purified on glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies were then raised in New Zealand female rabbits immunized with a mixture containing 300 μg of purified fusion protein in the presence of complete Freund's adjuvant and then boosted every 4 weeks first with 150 μg of each protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. For purification, the antisera was first depleted of the anti-GST antibodies by absorption to nitrocellulose strips saturated with the GST, followed by affinity purification of the anti-KCNK6 polyclonal antibodies against nitrocellulose strips saturated with the immunogen as described previously (18Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of microsomes, transfected COS-7 cells (see below for the transfection) were washed, sonicated in lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmiodoacetamide, 2 mm EDTA), and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min to obtain microsomes. 0.5–1 μg were then loaded on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9% gel) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were saturated with 4% low fat dry milk in PBS and incubated 1 h with affinity-purified anti-KCNK6 antibodies or M2 anti-tag monoclonal antibodies (Eastman Kodak Co.) diluted 500-fold, followed by an additional 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson) with extensive washing steps after antibody incubation, and finally revealed with Super Signal (Pierce). Transfected COS-7 cells were plated on glass coverslips onto 15-mm Petri dishes. 24 h after plating, the cells were fixed for 15 min with a 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS solution, rinsed with PBS, and then permeabilized by incubation for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (without Triton for nonpermeabilized conditions). Nonspecific binding was eliminated by a 2-h incubation with 5% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature. The cells were then incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified anti-KCNK6 antibody (1:400) or anti-TRAAK antibody (1:400) 2M. Salinas, R. Reyes, F. Lesage, M. Fosset, C. Heurteaux, G. Romey, and M. Lazdunski, unpublished data. in 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS, followed by washing with PBS and incubation for 1 h with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (1:200; Sigma) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (1:200, Sigma). After washing in PBS and finally in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, cells were mounted in Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and observed with a Leitz Aristoplan microscope (Wild Leitz) using an interference blue (fluorescein isothiocyanate) or green (rhodamine) filter and a × 40 lens. The eyes were enucleated and immediately fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 4 h. The lens and the vitreous were removed, and the eye-cup was cryoprotected in PBS containing 20% sucrose. Frozen sections (7 μm) were cut on a Leica cryostat and stored at −70 °C. For each retina, three sections were placed on 3-aminopropylethoxysilane-coated slides. Frozen sections were permeabilized with 0.3% Tween 20 in PBS for 3.5 min at room temperature followed by two rinses in PBS. Sections were then incubated with a blocking solution (1% goat serum/PBS) for 5 h, and then the primary antibody (1:400) was added overnight. After three rinses in PBS, the second goat anti-rabbit IgG biotinylated antibody (1:330) was incubated for 1 h and amplified with the Vectastain Elite ABC kit from Vector Laboratories. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining using the Vector Laboratories Kit. Control for the specificity of KCNK6 immunostaining was done by preabsorption of the primary antibodies (1:400) with the GST-KCNK6 fusion protein. All sections were washed three times in PBS and one time in distilled water and then mounted with Entellan (Merck). The coding sequence of KCNK6 was subcloned into theHpaI–NotI restriction sites of Flag-pRc/CMV vector to create an N-terminally tagged KCNK6 protein as described previously for the N-terminally tagged Kv2.2 protein (19Hugnot J.P.

Deletion channels and chimeras between KCNK6, mTREK1, and hTASK1 were constructed by PCR as described (20Lechleiter J. Hellmiss R. Duerson K. Ennulat D. David N. Clapham D. Peralta E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4381-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). PCRs were performed on Flag-pRc/CMVKCNK6 to keep the Flag peptide sequence at the amino extremity of the constructions. Products were subcloned intoEcoRI–BamHI site of pIRES-CD8 vector and verified by sequencing. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (60 mg/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin). One day before transfection, 20 × 103 cells for electrophysiology experiment or 70 × 103 cells for immunofluorescence microscopy were plated on cover glasses onto 35-mm Petri dishes. The cells were transfected by the classical DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method using 1 or 2 μg of supercoiled DNA. Gene mapping was performed by PCR on the Genebridge 4 radiation mapping panel (Research Genetics, Inc.) with the following primers: sense, 5′-CATGGCCCCACTATCGC-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGCAGTCGCCCTGAAGG-3′. The results were analyzed by using the RHMAPPER program at the Whitehead Institute with a logarithm of odds score of 21. The alignment was generated with the ClustalW multiple sequence analysis program. The dendrogram and the percentage of identity were deduced from the conserved region extending from the M1 to the M4 transmembrane domains. Accession numbers of the channel aligned are as follows: mTWIK,AF033017; mTRAAK, AF056492; hTASK-1, AF006823; hTASK-2, AF084830; mTREK1, U73488. The TWIK-1 sequence (7Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M.

A mouse EST (accession number W18545) was identified encoding a portion of a new α-subunit (named KCNK6). The corresponding full-length cDNA was obtained by RACE and sequenced. The coding sequence was then reamplified from both mouse brain and lung cDNAs to verify the sequence and to exclude all possible PCR errors. The KCNK6 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1008 base pairs and codes for a protein of 335 amino acids (Fig.1 A) with a calculated molecular mass of 35 kDa. KCNK6 is more related to TWIK-1 than to the other two-P domain K+ channels (40% of amino acid identity (Fig. 1 C)). Like all of these channels, KCNK6 displays four potential transmembrane segments (M1–M4) and two P domains (P1 and P2, P for pore-forming domain) (Fig. 1, A and B). Another important characteristic is the presence of an extended extracellular loop between M1 and P1 that contains a cysteine residue at a position (Cys57) analogous to the cysteine residue (Cys69) involved in the disulfide-bridged homodimerization of TWIK-1 (11Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of KCNK6 contains consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (residue 82) and phosphorylation by protein kinase C (residue 3) and casein kinase II (residues 255, 274, 276, 308, and 327). Three potential Src homology 3 binding motifs are present in the C-terminal part of the protein (minimal consensus sequence PXXP (21Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 22Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar)). Computer-based analysis also indicates the very interesting presence of a potential Ca2+-binding site (EF-hand motif) at its C terminus (Fig.1 D). This region includes the complete EF-hand loop as well as the first residue that follows the loop, which is always hydrophobic. Moreover, as in a classical EF-hand domain (23Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Goodman M. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 522-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 24Nakayama S. Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 416-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Heizmann C.W. Hunziker W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), the 12 residues loop of this region of KCNK6 are flanked on both sides by α-helical structures (nnPredict program; data not shown). In order to investigate KCNK6 mRNA expression, a Northern blot analysis was carried out using a mouse multiple-tissue Northern blot from CLONTECH. No KCNK6 transcripts were detected, indicating that KCNK6 is not expressed or is only expressed at very low levels in the tested tissues (heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis). The expression of KCNK6 was further studied on a larger panel of tissues with a more sensitive technique, reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 2 A). KCNK6 mRNA was detected in embryo (16–18 days), in eye, stomach, and lung. A weak expression was found in colon and testis. In the other tissues, the expression of KCNK6 mRNA was very low (atria, kidney, intestine, bladder, uterus, ovary, salivary gland, thymus, and brain stem) or not detectable (brain, cerebellum, spinal cord, heart, ventricle, skeletal muscle, liver, placenta, pancreas). In situ hybridization was performed on a vertical section of mouse retina. An antisense KCNK6 cRNA probe revealed an intense expression with a distinct stratification pattern. High labeling was apparent in the retinal ganglion cell layer (RGC) and in the inner nuclear layer (INL) composed of nuclei of Müller cells and amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal neurons (Fig. 2 B). The distribution of the hybridization signal suggests a neuronal localization of transcripts. The control sense probe did not show significant hybridization (data not shown). To confirm these results, immunohistochemistry was performed on an equivalent section. The KCNK6 protein was immunodetected in the same neurons. A strong immunoreactivity was observed in the retinal ganglion cell layer. In addition, regular punctual staining was detected in a specific neuron population of the distal area of the inner nuclear layer (Fig.2 C). To demonstrate the specificity of anti-KCNK6 antibodies, an equivalent section was incubated with anti-KCNK6 antiserum, which was previously absorbed with the GST-KCNK6 fusion proteins. As expected, the staining was prevented (data not shown).In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments did not show significant detection in the brain (data not shown). Electrophysiological attempts to record KCNK6 channel activity in various cell types like Xenopus oocytes, COS-7, HEK293, and Sf9 cells were unsuccessful. In all of these expression systems, attempts to activate channel activity with 1 μm Ca2+ at the intracellular side (because of the presence of the EF-hand domain), with external pH variations from pH 7.0 to 4.0, or with application of a phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) (there is one potential protein kinase C site (Fig. 1 A)) were without any success. We also tried a coexpression with the β1γ2 subunits of G proteins, which lead to activation of G-protein-gated inward rectifier (26Kofuji P. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6542-6546Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), as well as coexpression with the closely related two-P domain subunit TWIK-1, but again without success. Constructions with pCI and pRc/CMV expression vectors were also tested with the same negative results. Western blot analysis was then carried out to verify KCNK6 expression in transfected cells. Under nonreducing conditions, anti-tag antibodies (M2) detected a major band at a molecular mass of 83 kDa from COS-7 cells transfected with a tagged form of KCNK6. Under reducing conditions (i.e. in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol), two bands were detected with molecular mass of 44 and 40 kDa. A similar blot profile was revealed using affinity-purified anti-KCNK6 antibodies (Fig. 3 B). In order to demonstrate the specificity of the anti-KCNK6 antiserum and to justify its use to analyze the expression of the KCNK6 protein in transfected cells, we checked that no signal was obtained from control COS-7 cells expressing the TWIK-1 protein. This expression of the human TWIK-1 protein was verified in the same experiment with the affinity-purified rabbit antibodies directed against the C-terminal part of TWIK-1 (11Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The masses of 37 and 40 kDa are in good agreement with the theoretical values of 35 and 37 kDa for KCNK6 and its tagged form, respectively. As for the TWIK-1 subunit (11Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the observation that the band moving at 77 kDa gives rise to a band moving at 37 kDa in the presence of a reducing agent strongly suggests that KCNK6 can self-associate via a disulfide bond to form a homodimer. The masses of 41 and 44 kDa for KCNK6 and its tagged form suggest, as previously demonstrated for TWIK-1 (11Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the existence of glycosylated forms. All of these results were reproduced in Sf9 cells (data not shown). One possible reason for the lack of channel activity could of course be an intracellular localization of the expressed KCNK6 protein. To test this point, the KCNK6 subunit was localized by indirect immunofluorescence with the anti-KCNK6 antibodies (Fig. 3 C) on Triton-permeabilized COS-7 cells. A strong fluorescence staining was detected at the perinuclear region as well as in a fine reticular network extending through the cytoplasm. This pattern was observed in all of the KCNK6-expressing cells from multiple independent transfections. This pattern is similar to that seen with known ER markers (27Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that KCNK6 is specifically sequestered in the ER and cannot reach the plasma membrane. This pattern of labeling is very different from that obtained with the TRAAK channel. As shown in Fig. 3 D, TRAAK-expressing cells, which produce strong K+ currents (6Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), show a typical surface labeling. The first reason why KCNK6 cannot reach the surface membrane could reside in the peptide sequence itself. Protein retention in intracellular compartments is usually determined either by the presence of short transmembrane domains (27Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol.

Thus nine forms of adenylyl cyclase able to generate cAMP, and around 30 forms of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE)1 isoenzymes able to degrade cAMP, have been identified together with multiple forms of protein kinase A (PKA) and a large family of PKA-anchoring proteins (1Rubin C.S.

For example, the localization of particular adenylyl cyclase isoenzymes to distinct regions of the plasma membrane in polar cells (8Juilfs D. Fulle H.J. Zhao A.Z. Houslay M.D. Garbers D. Beavo J.A.

These arrangements demonstrate a propensity to organize the components of the cAMP signal transduction system within defined regions of the three-dimensional matrix of the cell interior. This, undoubtedly, provides the molecular basis of the compartmentalization of cAMP signaling that has been noted in a number of different cell types (1Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 2Houslay M.D. Milligan G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 4Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 312-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That specific adenylyl cyclase and PDE isoenzymes can be regulated through the action of a variety of intracellular signaling systems suggests that cAMP signaling may be regulated in distinct fashions in different cells (2Houslay M.D. Milligan G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE4 enzyme family is encoded by four genes which each produce a series of isoenzymes through alternative mRNA splicing (3Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 44: 225-342Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 6Bolger G. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Conti M. Nemoz G. Sette C. Vicini E.

Selective inhibitors of these enzymes are currently being developed as anti-inflammatory agents that appear likely to be of potential therapeutic use in a variety of disease states including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and AIDS (15Torphy T.J.

Each PDE4 isoenzyme has a unique N-terminal region which, in the case of the so-called “long” isoenzyme, are connected to the catalytic domain by two regions that provide unique signatures of this enzyme family. These are the Upstream ConservedRegions, UCR1 and UCR2 (19Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). One feature that distinguishes isoenzymes of each PDE4 class is the nature of their twoLinker Regions (3Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 44: 225-342Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar) namely LR1, which connects UCR1 to UCR2, and LR2, which connects UCR2 to the catalytic domain (3Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 44: 225-342Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). There is a growing realization that proteins involved in intracellular signaling systems can be recruited and organized within distinct intracellular domains (4Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 312-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SH3 domains, which are found in various families of proteins including adapter and cytoskeletal proteins and signal transducing proteins such as SRC family tyrosyl kinases, can serve such a function (20Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 21Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). They are distinct, self-folding, globular units of ∼60 residues that confer protein-protein interaction by binding proline-rich regions on acceptor proteins. Interactions involving SH3 domains allow the assembly of functionally active complexes that serve to control conformational switches in a number of key regulatory pathways (20Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). We have shown (12Huston E. Pooley L. Julien J. Scotland G. McPhee I. Sullivan M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31334-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that the N-terminal region of the long human PDE4A isoenzyme pde46 appears to be responsible, at least in part, for its intracellular targeting in COS7 cells. Such membrane association was accompanied (12Huston E. Pooley L. Julien J. Scotland G. McPhee I. Sullivan M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31334-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) by a profound increase in the sensitivity of the particulate form of this enzyme to inhibition by the archetypal PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram. Additionally, this interaction resulted in a striking change in the kinetics of enzyme inhibition by rolipram, implying that particulate association had triggered a conformational change in this enzyme. Here we identify a distinct proline- and arginine-rich stretch of sequence located within the LR2 region of pde46 which confers SH3 domain binding and triggers a conformational change in the catalytic unit of this enzyme.

PCR was first done using primer ESH1 with either primer ESH2a or ESH2b and primer ESH4 with either primer ESH3a or ESH3b. Fragments were then electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and excised. In a second PCR, in addition to primers ESH1 and ESH4, a small piece of gel (approximately 2 mm3) containing the PCR product of primers ESH1 + ESH2a was mixed with a piece of gel containing the PCR product of primers ESH3a + ESH4 in order to generate the Δa-h6.1 construct. In a similar fashion, the PCR product of primers ESH1 + ESH2b was mixed with PCR product of ESH4 + ESH3b to make the Δb-h6.1 construct. During the second PCR, after denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, the annealing temperature was dropped to 42 °C for 1 min to allow the complementary ends of the first round PCR products to anneal so that a hybrid product containing the desired deletion was created upon raising the temperature to 72 °C for 1.5 min. This product was then subjected to a further PCR using primers ESH1 and ESH4.

This generated the plasmid pSV.hPDE46-Δb. Confirmation of the mutation was obtained by sequencing of miniprep DNA. PCR was used to generate the LR2 region (3Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv.

The PCR fragment generated was treated with BamHI and XbaI, and the digested fragment was purified before ligation into theBamHI/XbaI sites of the plasmid pcDNA3, yielding the plasmid pcDNA-LR2-VSV. This was used as a template for PCR with the following oligonucleotide primers: h46 pGEX 5′, 5′-CGCGGATCCCATCACCCACG-3′, and h46 pGEX 3′, 5′-CGGCTCGAGTTACTTTCCCAGCC-3′. The resultant PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and XhoI; the fragment was gel-purified and ligated into BamHI, XhoI cut pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to form an in-frame fusion with the GST gene. The resultant plasmid was designated pGEX-LR2-VSV. Sequences of all constructs were confirmed.

Volumes of slurry containing 400 μg of fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose were pelleted, and the supernatants were discarded. Within each assay, volumes taken were equalized with washed beads. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μg of crude cytosol of COS7 cells transiently transfected to express the PDE4A form, diluted to a final volume of 200 μl in KHEM buffer (50 mmKCl, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, l0 mm EGTA, 1.92 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixture. The immobilized fusion protein and cytosol were incubated together for 10-min “end-over-end” at 4 °C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation for 5 s at high speed in a benchtop centrifuge, and the supernatant was retained as the unbound fraction. The beads were held on ice and washed three times with 400 μl of KHEM containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixture over a 15-min period. These washes were pooled along with the unbound fraction and aliquots taken for PDE assay and Western blotting. Bound PDE was eluted from the beads by incubating three times in 100 μl of elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), for 10 min at 4 °C. The eluted fractions were pooled and aliquots taken for PDE assay and Western blotting. COS7 cells were transfected with either native or the indicated mutant forms of pde46 and h6.1. They were lysed in KHEM buffer, and the high speed supernatant fraction was divided into 100-μl aliquots, each of which contained typically 180–200 μg of protein. In these experiments each 100-μl aliquot of the COS7 cell high speed supernatant fraction was incubated with 200 μg of the indicated SH3 domain-GST fusion protein that had been purified from bacterial extracts and immobilized on glutathione-agarose. The immobilized fusion protein and indicated PDE form were incubated end-over-end at 4 °C for 10 min. The beads were washed 3 times in KHEM buffer over a 15-min period and eluted by 3× 100-μl washes in ice-cold elution buffer (see above). The eluted fractions were then pooled and taken for immediate analysis of PDE activity. In some instances an additional 200 μg of SH3 domain GST fusion protein was added to the eluted fraction. Over the time of the PDE assay >95% of each of the PDE forms remained bound to the SH3 (LYN/FYN/SRC) fusion proteins. No binding occurred to GST alone, and GST addition to PDE assays did not elicit any change in rolipram inhibition of the PDEs analyzed herein.

The GST fusion protein GST-LR2-VSV (25 μg) was diluted to 500 μl in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100) containing an equal amount of GST or LYN-SH3 GST fusion protein. Fusion protein mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-VSV antiserum (1:50 v/v) or mouse IgG (1:50 v/v) after which protein A-agarose beads (1:50 v/v) were added. After incubation for an additional hour, immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g av and washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer. Following washing, immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-GST antiserum (1:5,000 v/v). Labeled bands were identified by using anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked IgG (1:10,000 v/v) and visualized with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL protocol. COS7 and COS1 cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid pcDNA3 containing a cDNA of full-length pde46 by the DEAE-Dextran transfection method. Seventy two hours post-transfection cells were harvested in RIPA buffer (55 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 132 mm NaCl, 22 mm sodium fluoride, 11 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.1 mm EDTA, 5.5 mm EGTA) and then lysed with 8 strokes of a 26½-gauge needle attached to a disposable syringe. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g av for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g av for 45 min at 4 °C to yield a high speed supernatant fraction (S2) and a high speed pellet fraction (P2). 500 μg of S2 was mixed with 30 μl of pre-equilibrated protein A-agarose and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g av for 5 min, and the cleared lysates were incubated with 4 μg/ml anti-LYN antisera in the presence of protein A-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation (2,000 × g av for 5 min) and washed three times with lysis buffer. 0.2 mg (protein) of the high speed (P2) pellet fraction was treated with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. They were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g av for 45 min at 4 °C.

The cytosolic fraction of pde46 from transfected COS7 cells, containing 8 pmol/min/μl enzyme, and the equivalent amount of cytosol (50 μg) from mock-transfected cells were each made up to 200 μl in PKA assay buffer (0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm[32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5) and incubated in the presence of 2 units of PKA for 30 min at room temperature. The sample was then divided into two equal aliquots, one of which was incubated in the presence of a LYN SH3-GST (100 μg) fusion protein, and the other was incubated in the presence of GST (100 μg) alone. After a 30-min incubation on ice, 50 μl of glutathione beads were added to each aliquot and incubated end-over-end for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 3 times in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors to remove any unbound proteins before being washed 3 times (5 s centrifugation at 10,000 × g av) in 100 μl of elution buffer (5 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) to release the GST, the LYN SH3-GST fusion protein, and any proteins that may have bound to them.

https://openalex.org/W2120397583,"A phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily was recently identified that contains proteins of highly diverse functions with the conserved motif HXKX 4DX 6G(G/S). The superfamily includes a bacterial nuclease, human and plant PLD enzymes, cardiolipin synthases, phosphatidylserine synthases, and the murine toxin from Yersinia pestis (Ymt). Ymt is particularly effective as a prototype for family members containing two conserved motifs, because it is smaller than many other two-domain superfamily enzymes, and it can be overexpressed. Large quantities of pure recombinant Ymt allowed the formation of diffraction-quality crystals for x-ray structure determination. Dimeric Ymt was shown to have PLD-like activity as demonstrated by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. Ymt also used bis(para-nitrophenol) phosphate as a substrate. Using these substrates, the amino acids essential for Ymt function were determined. Specifically, substitution of histidine or lysine in the conserved motifs reduced the turnover rate of bis(para-nitrophenol) phosphate by a factor of 104 and phospholipid turnover to an undetectable level. The role of the conserved residues in catalysis was further defined by the isolation of a radiolabeled phosphoenzyme intermediate, which identified a conserved histidine residue as the nucleophile in the catalytic reaction. Based on these data, a unifying two-step catalytic mechanism is proposed for this diverse family of enzymes.

Activity of this lipid-modifying enzyme is, therefore, tightly regulated by multiple activators including small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins from the ADP-ribosylation factor and Rho families, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and protein kinase C (reviewed in Ref. 1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Human PLD1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid and choline. Phosphatidic acid can be further hydrolyzed to lysophosphatidic acid by phospholipase A2 or to diacylglycerol by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase. PLD can also catalyze a transphosphatidylation reaction in which an alcohol (usually ethanol) substitutes for water in the reaction, resulting in the formation of the alcohol derivative of phosphatidic acid (typically phosphatidylethanol); this assay is commonly employed to measure PLD activity (2Yang S.F. Freer S. Benson A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 477-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other lipid-modifying enzymes such as cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine synthases also catalyze transphosphatidylation reactions. PLD is one of a group of enzymes with diverse functions that has been referred to as the PLD superfamily (3Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J.

All members contain a conserved motif, HXKX 4DX 6G(G/S).

The Y. pestis murinetoxin (Ymt) is encoded on a 110-kilobase plasmid that is unique to the bacterium which causes the plague (12Cherepanov P.A. Mikhailova T.G. Karimova G.A. Zakharova N.M. Ershov Y.V. Volkovoi K.I. Mol. Genet. Mikrobiol. Virusol. 1991; 12: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). Y. pestis is transferred between mammalian hosts via a flea vector. As a known determinant for plague virulence, Ymt is believed to play a role in Y. pestis pathogenesis, both in the rodent host and the flea vector (14Brubaker R.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1972; 57: 111-158PubMed Google Scholar, 15Butler T. Plague and other Yersinia infections. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). For example, Ymt may contribute to the more rapid death of mice injected with Y. pestis, as compared with mice injected with other Yersinia species (16Brubaker R.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In addition, Ymt is required for Y. pestis survival in the flea. 2B. J. Hinnebusch, unpublished observations. 2B. J. Hinnebusch, unpublished observations. Ymt is a 586-amino acid protein with two conserved motifs, HXKX 4DX 6G(G/S). It is similar to human PLD in having two of the superfamily signature motifs, but it is substantially smaller than the 1074-residue human PLD protein. The similarities in the two conserved motifs suggested that Ymt and PLD might utilize a common catalytic mechanism. Finally, an understanding of the activity and mechanism of Ymt would afford a rational approach for exploring the role of Ymt as a virulence factor for the plague bacterium, Y. pestis. We have, therefore, investigated the physical properties, function, and catalytic mechanism of the cloned toxin as a prototype for superfamily enzymes with two conserved motifs. In this report, we demonstrate that Ymt has PLD-like activity as assessed by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine as well as the transphosphatidylation reaction involving phosphatidylcholine. In addition, we have identified artificial substrates for Ymt to explore the catalytic mechanism. These substrates have allowed us to demonstrate that the invariant histidine and lysine residues found in the conserved motifs of all superfamily members are essential for catalysis. We have also shown that the catalysis by Ymt proceeds via a phosphoenzyme intermediate. Based on our findings, we propose a unifying, two-step mechanism for substrate hydrolysis by dual-domain PLD superfamily members. The expression of large concentrations of recombinant Ymt also allowed us to crystallize this protein, setting the stage for structural analysis of this member of the PLD superfamily.

The PCR product was ligated into theNdeI/SalI sites of a modified pT7–7 expression vector, which contains the lac operator (Ref. 17Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Using the wild-type Ymt construct as a template, the following mutations were made using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH): H188N, H524N, K190S, K526S, D195N, D531N, D195E, D531E, S539T, and S539A. For mutants with changes in two conserved residues, primers for both substitutions were utilized in conjunction. All mutations were verified by sequencing. The pT7–7 Ymt construct was used to transform Novoblue DE3 (Novagen) E. coli by standard methods. Single colonies were used to inoculate 1 liter of 2× YT medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.5–0.9, induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and grown for an additional 4 h at 25 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting pellets were frozen at −70 °C. Pellets were thawed at 0 °C, resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100), and lysed at 4 °C by three passages through a French press at 1200 p.s.i. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The clarified supernatant was incubated with gentle rotation for 1 h at 4 °C with 12 ml of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose that had been equilibrated in low salt buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The slurry was poured into a 50-ml column and washed with high salt wash buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Ymt was eluted with a gradient of 0–200 mm imidazole. Samples of fractions were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and fractions containing a single band corresponding to Ymt were pooled and concentrated using a Centriprep-30 filtration unit (Amicon), adjusted to 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. The final product was ≥99% pure by SDS-PAGE. The concentration was calculated using the determined extinction coefficient, 130,951.9 m−1 cm−1(see below). Full-length Ymt was diluted to 5 mg/ml in 10 mmNaCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and screened for crystallization conditions. Crystals (0.01 × 0.02 × 0.04 mm3) formed in condition #33 (2.0 m ammonium formate and 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) of the Hampton Research Crystal Screen II. Larger crystals (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm3) of full-length Ymt were grown by macroseeding. Crystals grown in 1.35–1.6m ammonium formate, 1% polyethylene-200, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, were placed in equilibrated 10-μl hanging drops containing 5 μl of protein solution, 15 mg/ml, and 5 μl of 1.5 m ammonium formate containing 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and allowed to grow for 21 days at 22 °C. The macroseeded crystals were frozen in 20% glycerol, 1.5m ammonium formate, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode equipped with a RAXIS IV detector. UV spectra of wild-type and mutant enzymes were recorded over a wavelength range of 240–310 nm at 25 °C using a Perkin-Elmer l6 spectrophotometer in assay buffer (25 mm Tris, 25 mm Bis-Tris, 50 mm acetate, pH 6.0). The final concentration of all proteins was 0.250 mg/ml in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded using a JASCO J-710 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C over a wavelength range of 178–260 nm. The final concentration of each protein was 0.1 mg/ml in distilled water. Size exclusion chromatography was used to determined the oligomeric state of purified recombinant Ymt. Ymt (100 μg) was injected onto a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The concentration of the purified protein was quantified by the University of Michigan Protein Core Facility (amino acid analysis performed on a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems model 420H hydrolyzer/derivatizer and 130A Separation System). Amino terminal sequence analysis was performed using a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems 494 sequenator. All assays were performed at 30 °C in assay buffer pH 6.0. For substrate screening, 1 μm of wild-type Ymt was incubated with bis(para-nitrophenyl) phosphate (2–20 mm), para-nitrophenyl phenyl phosphonate (2–100 mm), thymidine 5′-monophosphate para-nitrophenyl ester (2–50 mm), para-nitrophenyl phosphate (2–100 mm), or para-nitrophenyl phosphorylcholine (2–50 mm). Stock solutions of each substrate were made in assay buffer, adjusted to pH 6.0, diluted, and stored at 30 °C until use. For mutant enzyme assays, Ymt was incubated with 20 mm bis-pNPP in assay buffer at 30 °C. Final enzyme concentrations were as follows: 1 μm for wild-type Ymt, 10 μm for Ymt mutants with single amino acid substitutions, and 50 μm for Ymt with two amino acid substitutions. Product release (para-nitrophenolate) was monitored at 405 nm. Initial rates of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis were determined from continuous measurements taken over 3 min for wild-type Ymt or discontinuous readings taken over 2 h for Ymt mutants. Rates were calculated using the molar extinction coefficient for pNP, 18,000 m−1 cm−1, and corrected for pNP ionization (18Zhang Z.-Y. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1516-1525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All reactions were linear for the indicated time, and rates were corrected for spontaneous substrate hydrolysis. The nuclease assay was performed as described previously (19Zhao Y. Stuckey J.A. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1-4Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, calf thymus DNA (7.5 μg) was incubated with 0–3 μg of Nuc or Ymt for 20 min at 37 °C in assay buffer with 100 μm EDTA. Samples were resolved using a 1% agarose gel, and DNA was visualized under a UV light source. Phosphatidylcholine vesicles were prepared by mixingl-α-dipalmitoyl-[2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H] phosphatidylcholine (89 Ci/mmol) with unlabeled phosphatidylcholine to give a final concentration of 342 μm phosphatidylcholine (0.12 μCi/nmol). 10 μm of wild-type or mutant enzyme was incubated with 25 μl of vesicles for 1 h in a final volume of 150 μl. Lipids were extracted from the mixture by the addition of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (50:50:0.5). The lower phase was dried under nitrogen, dissolved in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (90:10:10), and subjected to thin-layer chromatography on a silica gel 60 plate in the solvent used for solubilization. Plates were sprayed with En3Hance™ (NEN Life Science Products), and radiolabeled products were detected by autoradiography. Radiolabeled phosphatidic acid was used as a standard. All assays were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl at 37 °C for 1 h. Headgroup-labeled phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine (as sonicated vesicles; final concentration, 10 μm) were incubated with wild-type Ymt (final concentration, 5 μm) in 150 μl for 1 h. The entire reaction was extracted in 1 ml of chloroform:methanol:concentrated HCl (50:50:0.5) and 350 μl of 1 mm EGTA in 1 m HCl. A portion of the upper, aqueous phase was subjected to scintillation counting. To measure phosphatidic acid formation and transphosphatidylation, sonicated phosphatidylcholine vesicles were prepared from chain-labeledl-α-dipalmitoyl[2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H]phosphatidylcholine and unlabeled dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Wild-type or mutant enzyme (final concentration, 10 μm) was incubated with 25 μl of vesicles for 1 h in a final volume of 150 μl with or without ethanol (final concentration, 0.5%). Lipids were extracted from the reaction by the addition of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (50:50:0.5). The lower phase was dried under nitrogen, dissolved in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (90:10:10), and subjected to thin-layer chromatography as described above. Plates were sprayed with En3Hance™, and radiolabeled products were detected by autoradiography. Radiolabeled phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanol were used as standards. Bovine serum albumin, wild-type Ymt, or mutant Ymt was incubated at a final concentration of 30 μm with 1 mmpotassium [32P]phosphate (15 Ci/mmol) at 25 °C in 200 mm acetate, pH 4.5. Typically, binding effeciency was 0.04–0.05%. Over 10 min, aliquots of the reaction were removed and quenched with an equal volume of carbonate buffer (1 mNa2CO3, pH 11, 0.5% SDS). Sample buffer (12 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 0.4% SDS, 2.9 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) was added, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in a 10% gel, which was subsequently dried and autoradiographed. To evaluate the stability of the phosphoenzyme, wild-type Ymt was labeled for 10 min at 25 °C as described, quenched, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) in transfer buffer (250 mmTris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol). Membranes were rinsed with methanol and water, then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with 200 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 m HCl, pH 1, 1m NaOH, pH 13, or 200 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 m hydroxylamine as described previously (19Zhao Y. Stuckey J.A. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1-4Crossref Google Scholar). Membranes were rinsed with water, dried, autoradiographed, and subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue. For pH stability studies, membranes containing phosphoprotein were counted in a Beckman scintillation counter and subsequently incubated at the indicated pH at 37 °C for 45 min (20Guan K.-L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Buffers used were as follows: pH 1.0, 1m HCl; pH 2–6, 2 m sodium acetate; pH 7–10, 1m Tris. After incubation, membranes were rinsed with water, dried, counted, and stained with Coomassie Blue to verify that protein remained bound. The extent of hydrolysis is reported as the percentage of the initial radioactivity on the membrane. Ymt was labeled as described above and subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 10% gel. Slices of acrylamide containing labeled Ymt were excised and submerged in 3 n KOH at 105 °C for 5 h. The resulting hydrolysate was diluted 400-fold with water containing internal standards. Phosphoamino acids were separated by ion-exchange chromatography (21Wei Y. Matthews H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 388-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). O-Phthalaldehyde was added to the eluate, and the resulting fluorescence was detected on-line (21Wei Y. Matthews H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 388-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Phospholysine and phosphohistidine were synthesized as described previously (21Wei Y. Matthews H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 388-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All other standards were purchased from Sigma. Ymt is a member of the PLD superfamily which, like human and plant PLD, contains two conserved motifs, HXKX 4DX 6G(G/S) (Fig. 1 A). The sequence for Ymt previously reported by Cherepanov et al. (12Cherepanov P.A. Mikhailova T.G. Karimova G.A. Zakharova N.M. Ershov Y.V. Volkovoi K.I. Mol. Genet. Mikrobiol. Virusol. 1991; 12: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar) contained three potential initiation methionine residues at positions 1, 42, and 56. We attempted to express recombinant protein using each of these residues as initiation codons. However, recombinant proteins starting with Met-42 and Met-56 were insoluble. Therefore, we utilized Met-1 as the initiation methionine for the protein used in our studies. Using this construct, Ymt containing a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine “affinity tag” was overexpressed and isolated using a single-step procedure to ≥99% purity (Fig. 1 B). Each liter of culture yielded 10–25 mg of purified Ymt, and amino-terminal sequencing of the recombinant protein revealed the predicted sequence, Met-Leu-Gln-Ile-Asp-Asn. Ymt has no known native substrates and no well defined catalytic activity. The PLD superfamily members include nucleases, lipid-synthesizing enzymes, and lipid-degrading enzymes. The one feature of all the substrates utilized by this diverse array of proteins is the phosphodiester bond. We reasoned that physiological substrates as well as artificial substrates would have to contain a hydrolyzable phosphate diester. Therefore, we explored nucleic acids and phospholipids as potential Ymt substrates. Ymt failed to hydrolyze DNA (data not shown); however, Ymt did hydrolyze phosphatidylethanolamine and to a lesser extent, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine in a headgroup release assay (Fig. 2). In a separate headgroup release assay, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (at 75 and 42 nm, respectively, the highest concentation possible in the assay), only 0.2 pmol of headgroup was released from phosphatidylinositol/h with Ymt, whereas phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was not cleaved. Upon TLC analysis, it was clear that Ymt cleaved the terminal phosphodiester bond ofl-α-dipalmitoyl[2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H]phosphatidylcholine to form phosphatidic acid and, in the presence of 0.5% ethanol, the transphosphatidylation product, phosphatidylethanol (data not shown). Although Ymt displays PLD characteristics, hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine in either reaction appears not to be stimulated by recombinant human ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, or sodium oleate (data not shown). Because end point lipid hydrolysis assays provide only a qualitative assessment of Ymt activity, we explored artificial substrates to facilitate quantitation of Ymt catalytic activity. Multiple phosphomonoester and phosphodiester substrates were screened as potential Ymt substrates (See “Experimental Procedures”). The best artificial substrate tested was the phosphodiester, bis-pNPP (Fig.3). Ymt hydrolyzed bis-pNPP to pNP and pNPP. pNPP is not a substrate for Ymt; thus, this enzyme is a phosphodiesterase and will not function as a phosphatase on phosphate monoesters. Hydrolysis of bis-pNPP by Ymt can be measured in a continuous assay and was found to be linear over 3 min at several substrate concentrations (Fig. 3 A). When initial velocities were plotted against the substrate concentrations, the reaction did not appear to follow Michaelis-Menton kinetics (Fig. 3 B). Limiting solubility (26 mm) of bis-pNPP prohibited determination of the kinetic parameters for hydrolysis. The artificial substrate does, however, afford a quantitative measure of activity and has a number of advantages over the end point assay employing phosphatidylcholine. The large quantities of pure Ymt allowed us to search for crystallization conditions for this protein. Ymt formed small rod-like crystals in 2.0 m ammonium formate and 100 mmHepes, pH 7.5, and diffraction-quality crystals were obtained by macroseeding (Fig. 4). The macroseeded crystals frozen in a solution containing 20% glycerol, 1.5m ammonium formate, and 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, diffracted to 3.5 Å resolution. These conditions provide the necessary starting point for determining the structure of Ymt by x-ray crystallography. Recently, Sung et al. (22Sung T. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) found that site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in the conserved motifs of human PLD1 resulted in a marked loss of PLD activity. These investigations employed human PLD produced by transiently transfected COS-7 cells. The limited quantity of enzyme obtained from cell lysates prohibited a detailed analysis of the role of these residues in PLD catalysis. To define the role of the conserved residues in the two Ymt signature motifs, histidines in the first and/or second conserved motif of Ymt were replaced with asparagine by site-directed mutagenesis (H188N, H524N, and H188N/H539N). Using similar methodology, lysines were substituted with serine (K190S, K526S, K190S/K526S), and the aspartic acids were replaced with asparagine or glutamic acid (D195N, D531N, D195N/D531N, or D/E). In addition, a conserved serine in the second motif was replaced by threonine or alanine (S539T or S539A, Table I). Although substitution of the conserved aspartic acid in either domain rendered the enzyme insoluble, all other mutations yielded soluble proteins that were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 5).Table IBis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate hydrolysis by wild-type and mutant YmtSubstituted residues are indicated for each mutant.a Activity is based on a subsaturating substrate concentration (20 mm), n = 3.b Wild type. Open table in a new tab Substituted residues are indicated for each mutant. a Activity is based on a subsaturating substrate concentration (20 mm), n = 3. b Wild type. As the mutations may potentially disrupt secondary structure, the structure of each mutated enzyme was evaluated using UV absorbance, CD, and size-exclusion chromatography. The UV and CD spectra of the Ymt mutants were identical to that of wild-type Ymt suggesting that replacement of residues in the conserved motifs did not disrupt the secondary structure of this enzyme (data not shown). In addition, the oligomeric state of the Ymt was assessed using size-exclusion chromatography. Amino acid analysis as well as the cDNA sequence predicted a protein of 61.1 kDa which is consistent with the size determined by SDS-PAGE (63 kDa, Fig. 1 B). However, all proteins eluted from a Superose 6 size-exclusion column at an apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa, which suggests that wild-type and mutant Ymt exist as dimers (data not shown). In an effort to functionally evaluate these mutant enzymes, we employed the physiological and artificial substrates for wild-type Ymt, phosphatidylcholine and bis-pNPP, respectively. Replacement of both conserved histidines or lysines reduced phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by Ymt to an undetectable level (data not shown). Artificial substrate hydrolysis was also markedly reduced as a result of substitutions in the conserved motifs (Table I). Substitution of the asparagine for histidine in the first conserved motif (H188N) reduced the turnover rate of bis-pNPP 164-fold. Similarly, mutagenesis of the histidine in the second conserved motif (H524N) reduced the rate of hydrolysis 470-fold. Replacement of both conserved histidines in the signature motifs resulted in a multiplicative functional loss and reduced the turnover rate 16,400-fold. Mutagenesis of the lysine residues in the conserved motifs resulted in similar losses of activity (Table I). Based on the catalytic activity of human PLD produced in COS-7 cells, Sung et al. (22Sung T. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4"

IL-6 signals by induction of a gp130 homodimer (e.g. IL-6), whereas CNTF and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signal via a heterodimer of gp130 and LIF receptor (LIFR). Despite binding to the same receptor component (gp130) and a similar protein structure, IL-6 and CNTF share only 6% sequence identity. Using molecular modeling we defined a putative LIFR binding epitope on CNTF that consists of three distinct regions (C-terminal A-helix/N-terminal AB loop, BC loop, C-terminal CD-loop/N-terminal D-helix). A corresponding gp130-binding site on IL-6 was exchanged with this epitope. The resulting IL-6/CNTF chimera lost the capacity to signal via gp130 on cells without LIFR, but acquired the ability to signal via the gp130/LIFR heterodimer and STAT3 on responsive cells. Besides identifying a specific LIFR binding epitope on CNTF, our results suggest that receptor recognition sites of cytokines are organized as modules that are exchangeable even between cytokines with limited sequence homology.

CNTF belongs to the IL-6 type family of hematopoietic and neurotrophic cytokines that also encompasses interleukin 6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M, cardiotrophin-1, and interleukin 11 (IL-11). All IL-6 type cytokines use a membrane spanning 130-kDa glycoprotein, gp130, as a signal transducing subunit (8Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev.

Despite very limited sequence homology, the IL-6 type cytokines were predicted to share a common structure consisting of four anti-parallel α-helices (A, B, C, and D) connected by two long cross-over loops (AB, CD) and one short loop (BC) (10Bazan J.F. Neuron. 1991; 7: 197-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 11Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This so-called “four-helix bundle” structure represents a fundamental protein fold characteristic of most cytokines (11Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Crystallographic and NMR studies have confirmed this structure for IL-6, CNTF, and LIF (12Somers W. Stahl M. Seehra J.S.

Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). CNTF first binds in a 1:1 stoichiometry to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ligand binding α-unit, CNTF receptor (CNTFRα), which is not involved in signal transduction (16Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Valenzuela D.M. Wong V.V. Furth M.E. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). This is followed by the recruitment of gp130 and LIFR as membrane spanning signal transducing β-units (15Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), which in turn form a disulfide-linked heterodimer that activates the JAK/STAT and the Ras/MAP kinase pathways (8Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Signaling of cardiotrophin-1, LIF, and oncostatin M also occurs via a gp130/LIFR heterodimer. Similar to CNTF, cardiotrophin-1 first binds to non-signaling receptor α-unit (8Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar), whereas LIF and oncostatin M directly bind to LIFR and gp130, respectively (17Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of IL-6 to a non-signaling α-unit, gp80 (IL-6Rα), induces gp130 homodimerization and subsequent activation of Jak/Tyk kinases (8Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments in solution as well as biophysical evidence suggested that the IL-6 and CNTF receptor complexes are hexamers consisting of IL-6, IL-6Rα, and gp130 in a 2:2:2 stoichiometry (18Paonessa G.

Rose-John S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Other authors argued that structural constraints of the above hexameric models would lead to contradictions with the hitherto observed general conservation of the structural arrangement of cytokine receptors (23Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A new hexameric model for the IL-6 receptor complex could alleviate these structural objections (23Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Adapted to the CNTFR receptor complex it nevertheless implies, as does the model suggested by de Serio et al. (20De Serio A. Graziani R. Laufer R. Ciliberto G. Paonessa G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that the same site of CNTF is able to contact either gp130 or LIFR which rules out the existence of a genuine and specific LIFR-binding site on CNTF. Mutagenesis studies of CNTF, IL-6, and LIF have identified contact sites of these cytokines with the subunits of their respective receptor complexes. For IL-6 and CNTF the contact site with the receptor α-unit could be mapped to a site that includes residues of the C-terminal AB loop and the C-terminal D-helix (13McDonald N.Q. Panayotatos N.

In IL-6, a second gp130-binding site consists of amino acids residues of the N-terminal AB loop, the C-terminal CD loop, and the N-terminal D-helix (27Ehlers M. Grötzinger J. deHon F.D. Müllberg J.

This site is now termed site III in continuation of the growth hormone terminology. Crystallographic and mutagenesis studies of CNTF and LIF indicated that residues of the C-terminal B-helix, possibly the BC loop, CD loop, and the N-terminal D-helix constitute site III in these cytokines (13McDonald N.Q.

Considering the conserved four-helical bundle structure of most cytokines we reasoned that receptor recognition sites of cytokines might have evolved as discontinuous modules which should principally be exchangeable between different cytokines. A comparison of the homology based IL-6 model and the x-ray structure of CNTF (13McDonald N.Q. Panayotatos N. Hendrickson W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Ehlers M. Grötzinger J. deHon F.D. Müllberg J. Brakenhoff J.P. Liu J. Wollmer A. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1744-1753PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to define boundaries of the potential LIFR binding epitope of CNTF which encompasses residues of the C-terminal A-helix, the N-terminal AB loop, the BC loop, the C-terminal CD-loop, and the N-terminal D-helix. The transfer of this putative “LIFR binding module” from CNTF to IL-6 resulted in a chimeric IL-6/CNTF molecule that binds to IL-6Rα and signals via a heterodimer of gp130 and LIFR. Effectively, this “module swap” created a new cytokine with LIF-like, but IL-6R dependent activity on cells expressing gp130, IL-6Rα, and LIFR. On a more general basis, our results indicate that cytokines are organized as a set of modules, making specific contacts to different receptors. Human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma, HepG2 and Hep3B hepatoma and COS-7 cells (bought from ATCC (Manassas, VA)) were routinely grown in RPMI or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. BAF/3 cells transfected with human gp130 were a kind gift from Immunex (Seattle, WA). BAF/3-(gp130) cells were stably transfected with cDNAs coding for human IL-6R, human CNTFR, or human LIFR as described elsewhere (17Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus four different cell lines were generated: BAF/3-(gp130,IL-6R) cells, BAF/3-(gp130,LIFR) cells, BAF/3-(gp130,LIFR,IL-6R) cells, and BAF/3-(gp130,LIFR,CNTFR) cells. The relative expression of the receptors of the IL-6 family on the different BAF/3 cell lines as well as the SK-N-MC cells was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using the murine monoclonal antibodies B-S12 (anti-gp130), B-R6 (anti-IL-6R), AN-E1 (anti-LIFR), and AN-D3 (anti-CNTFR) and is shown in Table I. B-S12 and B-R6 have been described in detail before (36Fourcin M. Chevalier S. Guillet C. Robledo O. Froger J. PouplardBarthelaix A. Gascan H. J. Biol.

The discrete regions of human IL-6 and CNTF used to construct the chimeras are given in Fig. 1. Construction of chimeras IC1, IC2, and IC3 relied heavily on PCR-ligation-PCR (37Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs of human IL-6 and CNTF cloned into the pRSET5d bacterial expression vector via NcoI and HindIII restriction sites served as PCR templates (27Ehlers M. Grötzinger J. deHon F.D. Müllberg J. Brakenhoff J.P. Liu J. Wollmer A. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1744-1753PubMed Google Scholar,28Krüttgen A. Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Weis J. Simon R.

To construct chimera IC1, an IL-6 cDNA fragment encoding the N-terminal part of the molecule to Arg40 and a C-terminal CNTF cDNA fragment starting at the codon for Asp36 were amplified by standard PCR. The PCR products were ligated (37Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar) and the ligation product subsequently amplified by PCR to produce the fragment IL-6(Pro1-Arg40):CNTF(Glu36-Met56). This fragment was purified from a 1% agarose gel and ligated to the amplified C-terminal IL-6 cDNA fragment starting at the codon for Asn60. The ligation product, IC1, was amplified by PCR and subsequently cloned into the bacterial pRSET5d expression vector after digestion with NcoI and HindIII. Chimeras IC2 and IC3 were constructed analogously. The sequences of all primers used are available on request. Chimeras IC4 to IC6 were produced from chimeras IC1 to IC3 using NcoI, AccI, XbaI, andHindIII restriction enzymes. IC7 was produced from IC1 and IC6. The integrity of all constructs was verified by restriction fragment analysis and DNA sequencing according to standard methods (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 1744-1753PubMed Google Scholar) and the x-ray structure of CNTF as taken from the Brookhaven data bank (accession code 1cnt). Recently, the x-ray as well as the NMR structure of human IL-6 were solved (12Somers W. Stahl M. Seehra J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 39Xu G.Y. Yu H.A.

Structure comparisons and all computer graphic work were performed with the WHATIF program package running on an SGI-Indigo2 (40Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). For graphical representation the program Grasp was used (41Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli bacteria (strains BL21-DE3 and BL21 pLysS) were transformed with the expression vector pRSET5d containing human IL-6, human CNTF, and chimeric cDNAs. Transformed bacteria were grown to an A 600 of approximately 0.5–0.7 and induced to produce recombinant protein by addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 2 h, purification of inclusion bodies and denaturation with 6 m guanidinium chloride was performed as described before (42van Dam M. Müllberg J. Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Brakenhoff J.P. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15285-15290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Refolding of proteins was achieved by dialysis against refolding buffer (1 m guanidinium chloride, 3 mm oxidized glutathione, 0.6 mm reduced glutathione, 12 h) and 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8 (12 h). The purity of the recombinant proteins was ascertained by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue or silver. In addition, protein concentrations were determined by hydrolysis of the proteins in 6 m HCl and subsequent amino acid analysis. LPS concentrations in the purified protein preparations were ascertained with the Limulus amobecyte lysate assay (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD). CD spectra of all chimeras were taken on an AVIV CD spectrometer 62DS and on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter. Both instruments were calibrated with an aqueous solution of 10-camphosulfonic acid at 25 °C. The spectral band width was 1.5 nm. Protein samples were dissolved in water, the pH was adjusted to 3.5. Proliferation of at least two different clones of the transfected BAF/3-(gp130) cell lines in response to human IL-6, human CNTF, human LIF, and the chimeras IC1 to IC7 was measured in 96-well microtiter plates. The cells were exposed to test samples for 72 h and subsequently pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine for 4 h. Proliferation rates were measured by harvesting the cells on glass filters and determination of the incorporated radioactivity by scintillation counting. For each mutant and each cell line the proliferation assay was performed at least three times in triplicate. Haptoglobin production by HepG2 and Hep3B cells in response to stimulation with the above cytokines and chimeras was measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described recently (43Oppmann B. Stoyan T. Fischer M. Voltz N. März P. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 195: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were simultaneously transfected with cDNAs for human gp130, LIFR, IL-6R, and STAT3 with the DEAE-dextran method as described (44Renné C. Kallen K.-J. Müllberg J. Jostock T. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27213-27319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). gp130 and LIFR were subcloned into the p409 expression vector (a kind gift from Immunex). The human IL-6R was in the pCDM8 expression vector, STAT3 in pSVL. After transfection, COS-7 cells were cultured for 2 days in RPMI plus 10% fetal calf serum before starvation in serum-free medium. SK-N-MC, HepG2, and transfected COS-7 cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium before stimulation with cytokines. After stimulation, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 3 mm sodium orthovanadate containing 1% Brij-96. Insoluble material was pelleted and the supernatants immunoprecipitated overnight with B-S12 anti-gp130 (2 μg/ml) or AN-E1 anti-LIFR mAb (10 μg/ml). The complexes were isolated with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and the supernatants subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (5 μg/ml) after addition of 1% Nonidet P-40. The precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with an appropriate primary antibody before being labeled with a secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase. Subsequently, the membranes were developed using the Amersham ECL kit. The four-helix bundle fold (Fig. 1 A) is the characteristic structure of most cytokines (11Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the backbone atoms of the IL-6 NMR and the CNTF x-ray structure is shown in Fig. 1 B. Both structures were superimposed onto each other using the Cα-atoms of the helices to identify putative components of the site III receptor binding epitope. The segments of IL-6 and CNTF which participated in the “epitope shuffle” of site III are color coded and designated as IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, respectively (Fig. 1, A andB). A structural analysis of CNTF suggested that amino acid residues situated in the C-terminal A-helix (Glu36-Gln42) and N-terminal AB loop (Gly43-Met56) form site IIIA, while the BC loop (His97-Asp104) with adjacent residues of the B- (Leu91-Val96) and C-helix (Phe105-Ile109) represents site IIIB. Together with site IIIC which closely corresponds to Bazan's D1 motif (10Bazan J.F. Neuron. 1991; 7: 197-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and consists of the C-terminal CD loop (Gly147-Leu151) and the N-terminal D-helix (Phe152-Leu162) they constitute the putative LIFR-binding epitope on CNTF (site III).

Unlike most types of HPV, the E2 protein of epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV)-associated HPVs harbors a relatively long hinged region between the terminal, conserved transactivation and DNA binding/dimerization domains. The sequence of EV-HPV E2 hinge contains multiple arginine/serine (RS) dipeptide repeats which are characteristic of a family of pre-messenger RNA splicing factors, called SR proteins. Here we show that the HPV-5 (an EV-HPV) E2 protein can specifically interact with cellular splicing factors including a set of prototypical SR proteins and two snRNP-associated proteins. Transiently expressed HPV-5 E2 protein colocalizes with a nuclear matrix associated-splicing coactivator in nuclear speckled domains. The RS-rich hinge is essential for E2 transactivator interaction with splicing factors and for its subnuclear localization. Moreover, we present functional evidence for the HPV-5 E2 transactivator, which shows that the RS-rich hinge domain of the E2 protein can facilitate the splicing of precursor messenger RNA made via transactivation by E2 itself. Our results, therefore, suggest that a DNA binding transactivator containing an RS-rich sequence can play a dual role in gene expression.

With few exceptions, papillomaviruses are highly species- and lesion-specific. A large group (∼20 types) of human papillomaviruses are specifically linked with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV),1 which is a rare hereditary, lifelong disease characterized by the development of multiple cutaneous warts (2Pfister H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 263-271PubMed Google Scholar). Infection by EV-associated HPV types 5 and 8 carries a high risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma, implicating these viruses in oncogenicity (2Pfister H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 263-271PubMed Google Scholar). Papillomavirus gene expression is controlled by the products encoded by the viral E2 gene (3Ham J. Dostatni N. Gauthier J.-M. Yaniv M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The papillomavirus E2 proteins recognize the palindromic sequence ACCN6GGT, which occurs in multiple copies within the long control region of viral genomes and function as transcriptional activators. The E2 protein contains two defined functional domains that are relatively conserved among different types of papillomaviruses. The N-terminal conserved domain, consisting of approximately 200 amino acids, is crucial for transcriptional activation, whereas the domain at the C terminus consisting of approximately 100 amino acids contains the DNA binding and dimerization properties of the protein. These two domains are linked by a hinge region that lacks conservation in amino acid sequence and varies in length among papillomaviruses. The hinge region of the bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E2 protein was predicted to adopt a random coil structure and could confer flexibility to the E2 molecule (3Ham J. Dostatni N. Gauthier J.-M. Yaniv M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Unlike the two well defined terminal domains, the function of the hinge region remains largely unclear. In comparison with several well studied E2 gene products, the E2 protein of EV-associated HPVs harbors a relatively long hinge region (∼200 amino acid residues) and the hinge sequence is rich in arginine, serine, and glycine residues (Fig. 1). The arginine/serine (RS) dipeptide repeat in the hinge is characteristic of a superfamily of proteins, which are primarily involved in the splicing of precursor mRNA (4Fu X.-D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 5Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 6Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A group of prototypical SR proteins containing an extensive RS domain at the C terminus can be recognized by monoclonal antibody (mAb) 104, which stains lateral loops corresponding to sites of RNA pol II transcription on amphibian lampbrush chromosomes (7Roth M.B. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Individual SR proteins can complement splicing deficient cytoplasmic S100 extract, indicating that they are essential splicing factors but have redundant functions in splicing (8Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). SR proteins are also crucial players in alternative splicing by modulating splice site choice; different SR proteins affect splice site selection with different efficiencies and with different mechanisms (4Fu X.-D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 5Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 6Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the prototypical SR proteins, the RS domain or its analogous arginine alternating domain (9Perutz M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) is also present in other essential splicing factors and regulators including U2AF subunits, U1 and U5 snRNP-associated SR proteins, and Drosophila Tra and Tra-2 proteins (4Fu X.-D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). Using a variety of methods, some RS domains have been shown to mediate protein-protein interaction between SR proteins (10Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Some RS domains can influence RNA binding (5Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) or promote RNA-RNA annealing (11Lee C.G. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13472-13478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Valcarcel J. Gaur R.K. Singh R. Green M.R. Science. 1996; 273: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition, short stretches of RG or RGG repeats scatter within the hinge region of EV-HPV E2 proteins; some of these repeats neighbor a serine residue as SRG or SRGG (Fig. 1). The RG-rich sequence of the E2 hinge is reminiscent of the RGG box that is present in a number of RNA-binding proteins, including some nucleolar proteins, the ICP27 protein of herpes simplex virus, and the EBNA1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus (13Kiledjian M. Burd C.G. Gorlach M. Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. Nagai K. Mattaj I.W. RNA-Protein Interactions. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 127-149Google Scholar). The realization that EV-HPV E2 proteins contain an RS-rich hinge domain suggests that they may exert a function similar to that of cellular SR proteins or interact with SR proteins through their RS repeat sequence. In the present study, we show that the HPV type-5 (an EV-HPV) E2 protein can specifically interact with several cellular splicing factors of the SR protein family. Our indirect immunofluorescent study revealed that transiently expressed HPV-5 E2 protein in transfected HeLa cells colocalize with a splicing factor in nuclear matrix speckles. More importantly, we provide evidence suggesting that the HPV-5 E2 protein likely participates in pre-mRNA splicing as well as in transcriptional regulation. Plasmids HPV5/9 and pSV2-neo HPV-16 were obtained from E.-M. de Villiers (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany) and W. C. Y. Yu (Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan), respectively, and they were used as template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the HPV-5 or HPV-16 E2 coding region. The PCR product containing HPV-5 E2 ORF was cloned into pGEM-1 (Promega), generating plasmid pSP5E2. Likewise, plasmid pSP16E2 was constructed. These two plasmids were used as template for in vitro synthesis of HPV-5 and HPV-16 E2 proteins, respectively. Bacterial expression vector pAR5E2ΔH was constructed as follows. The PCR product containing HPV-5 E2 ORF was inserted into pAR3930–1 (14Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) to generate pAR5E2. The restricted fragment of pAR5E2 coding for amino acid residues 228–515 in full-length HPV-5 E2 was replaced by the PCR product spanning amino acid residues 397–515, generating pAR5E2ΔH. The pAR5E2ΔH plasmid was used to overproduce the hinge-deleted E2 protein. Plasmids pAD5E2 and pAD5E2ΔH used for yeast two-hybrid assays were constructed as follows. The coding sequences for full-length and hinge-deleted HPV-5 E2 were in-frame placed downstream of the GAL4 activation domain in pACT2 (CLONTECH) using restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI. To construct pEGU5–100kD, the DNA fragment encoding the U5–100kD protein was generated by PCR using pBluescriptSK-100KHeLa (gift of R. Luhrmann, Philipps-Universität, Marburg, Germany) as template and then inserted into pEG202 (15Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1994; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid produced the U5–100kD protein fusion with the LexA DNA binding domain. The remaining pEG202-derived plasmids including pEGASF, pEGSC35, and pEGU1–70K were generous gifts of J. Y. Wu (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Mammalian expression vectors for transient expression of the full-length and hinge-deleted HPV-5 E2 proteins were constructed as follows. The DNA fragment containing E2 ORF amplified by PCR was inserted into pCEP4 (Invitrogen), creating the pC5E2 plasmid. Similarly, plasmid pC5E2ΔH was constructed in which amino acid residues 228–396 were deleted from the HPV-5 E2 protein and plasmid pC5E2.HA was constructed to express the E2 protein containing the HA epitope at the C terminus. The reporter plasmid pE2Sp1-CAT, which was previously named as pE2x2-Sp1x2-tk(-38)-cat (16Ushikai M. Lace M.J. Yamakawa Y. Kono M. Anson J. Ishiji T. Parkkinen S. Wicker N. Valentine M.E. Davidson I. Turek L.P. Haugen T.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6655-6666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of T. H. Haugen (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Plasmid pE2Sp1-CAT(In1) was constructed by insertion of a 130-base pair intron into the PvuII site of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) ORF. The intron was derived from the human β-globin gene and slightly modified to confer the 5′ splice site consensus GTAAGT. Likewise, the β-globin intron was inserted into the filled-inHindIII site, upstream of the CAT ORF (In2) or theScaI site near the 3′ end of the CAT ORF (In3), or theHincII site upstream of the polyadenylation signal (In4), resulting in three other intron-containing reporters. The pE2Sp1-βgal plasmid was made by replacing the CAT gene with the β-galactosidase gene derived from pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pSV40-CAT(In1) plasmid was constructed by placing a fragment containing the CAT gene with the β-globin intron insertion derived from pE2SP1-CAT(In1) into pCH110 using restriction enzymesHindIII and BamHI. In this study, the sequences of DNA fragments amplified by PCR were verified by sequencing using the dideoxy method. To fractionate extracts by (NH4)2SO4precipitations, HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared from frozen nuclei (Cell Culture Center) according to Dignam et al. (17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar), except that glycerol was omitted from the dialysis buffer D. After dialysis, the extract was subjected to centrifugation at 4 °C in a JA-20 rotor (Beckman) at 35,000 × g for 30 min. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to yield 65% saturated solution. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and then resuspended in buffer D, followed by dialysis against buffer D. The concentration of the (NH4)2SO4-precipitated nuclear protein fraction (NE65P) was ∼12 mg/ml. To enrich snRNP-associated proteins, 20 μl of anti-Sm monoclonal antibody (gift of J. A. Steitz, Yale University, New Haven, CT) was coupled to 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose (PAS) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.5 ml of NET-2 buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Two hundred microliters of NE65P were incubated with antibody-coupled PAS at 4 °C for 1 h. After removing unbound proteins, the resin was washed four times with 1 ml of NET-2 buffer. Bound proteins were recovered and subjected to Western and Far-Western blot analyses. A mixture of SR proteins was prepared from HeLa cell nuclei according to the method described by Zahler et al. (8Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). SR proteins were examined by complementation of the splicing defect of the HeLa cell S100 extract. Plasmid pAR5E2ΔH was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3); overproduction of the hinge-deleted HPV-5 E2 (E2ΔH) protein was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Overproduced E2ΔH protein was solubilized from inclusion bodies with 8m urea followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel purification and then used to immunize rabbits. To purify antibodies, recombinant E2ΔH was coupled to Sepharose according to the method provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-HPV-5 E2 sera were subjected to chromatography on E2ΔH-coupled Sepharose essentially according to Harlow and Lane (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The concentration of affinity-purified antibodies was ∼5 mg/ml. In vitrotranscription-translation-coupled reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). Plasmids used in this experiment were all derived from pGEM-1 (Promega); each contained the coding region for HPV-5 E2, HPV-16 E2, ASF/SF2, SC35, U1–70K, U5–100kD, and GAL4-VP16 (gift of Y.-S. Lin, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan), respectively. When used as probes, unincorporated labels were removed by chromatography on a NAP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To co-immunoprecipitate HPV-5 E2 and SR proteins, 25 μl each of in vitrotranscription-translation mixtures containing unlabeled HPV-5 E2 and35S-labeled SR protein were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Ten micrograms of affinity-purified anti-E2 antibodies were coupled to 2.5 mg of PAS in NET-2 buffer as described above. The mixture containing HPV-5 E2 and an SR protein was then incubated with anti-E2 coupled PAS at 4 °C for 1 h. Unbound proteins were removed, and the resin was then washed four times with 1 ml of NET-2 buffer. Bound proteins were recovered, resolved on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. To analyze protein-protein interaction by Far-Western blotting, SR and snRNP proteins were fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The blot was incubated with binding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 3 mmMgCl2, 4 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 10 min at 4 °C. The blot was subsequently incubated with binding buffers containing decreasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride for 5 min per change. Blockage of the blot was performed by incubation with 5% skim milk and 1 mm DTT in TBST (100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, followed by 1% skim milk and 1 mm DTT in TBST for 1 h. The blot was incubated with 0.5–1 × 106 cpm/ml of 35S-labeled E2 protein in TBST containing 1% skim milk and 1 mm DTT at 4 °C overnight. To remove unbound proteins, the blot was washed with TBST containing 1% skim milk twice and then with TBST once for 10 min per wash. The blot was subjected to autoradiography. For Western blotting analysis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blot was probed with anti-U1–70K antibody or anti-U5–100kD anti-serum (generous gifts of R. Luhrmann), and signals were detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A pACT2-derived bait plasmid and a pEG202-derived prey plasmid were co-transformed with the LacZ reporter pSH18.34 into Saccharomyces. cerevisiae EGY48 (Mata trp1 ura3 his3 LEU::pLexop6-LEU2) using the modified lithium acetate transformation protocol provided by CLONTECH. Plasmid DNA was recovered from the transformants and verified by Southern blot analysis. Five independent clones of each transformants were subjected to the liquid β-galactosidase assay usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate according to the protocol recommended byCLONTECH; each clone was assayed three times. HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented withl-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using calcium phosphate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were plated onto Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc Inc.) and incubated for another 24 h. For double-label immunofluorescence experiments, cells grown on chamber slides were rinsed twice with PBS and fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 30 min followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked by 3% skim milk in PBS for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibodies in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were affinity-purified anti-E2 antibodies (5 μg/ml), mAb B4A11 (1 μg/ml; Calbiochem), and anti-HA antibody (1:20 dilution from the supernatant of hybridoma culture medium; gift of S.-C. Cheng, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan). Cells were then washed with PBS, followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies, fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (7.5 μg/ml; Cappel Laboratories) or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (12 μg/ml, Cappel Laboratories), in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with PBS, cells on slides were mounted immediately with mounting medium (Biomeda). The specimens were observed using a laser confocal microscope (MRC 600 model; Bio-Rad) coupled with an image analysis system. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described above. Cells were seeded 18 h before transfection and transfection using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was performed essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transfection, the amount of plasmids used was indicated in each figure legend. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection. One tenth of the cells were lysed in a denaturing buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis, and the remaining cells were lysed in 120 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.25 mTris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.5% Triton X-100 (∼2.5 × 104 cells/μl of buffer) to obtain the cell extract for CAT assay or for both CAT and β-galactosidase activity assays. The method for the CAT assay is described by Carey et al. (19Carey M. Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Ptashne M. Nature. 1990; 345: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). For the β-galactosidase activity assay, the reaction was performed using the chemiluminescent substrate Galacton-Star (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the luminescent enzyme activity was measured according to the method described by Schoneich et al. (20Schoneich J. Lee J.L. Mansky P. Sheffery M. Yang S.Y. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4788-4796PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For RNase protection assays, all RNA samples were prepared from 60-mm dish cultures 24 h after transfection. Total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then treated with DNase I (1 unit/1 μg of RNA; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Five (pSV40 plasmid) or 15 (pE2Sp1 plasmids) micrograms of DNase-treated RNA were combined with 2 × 105 cpm anti-CAT probe (specific activity 3.4 × 108 cpm/μg) in a 30-μl mixture containing 40 mm PIPES (pH 6.7), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 80% formamide. The RNA-probe mixture was heated at 85 °C for 5 min and then incubated at 45 °C for 5 h to allow annealing. The digestion was performed by adding 300 μl of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 0.3m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and RNase T1 (0.6 unit/μl of reaction; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. Northern blot analysis was performed essentially as described by Tarnet al. (21Tarn W.-Y. Yario T.A. Steitz J.A. RNA. 1995; 1: 644-656PubMed Google Scholar) except that each sample contained 0.5 μg of RNA and anti-U1 riboprobe was used. As described above, the E2 protein of EV-HPVs has an unusual feature in its primary structure, i.e. a long hinge region containing multiple RS dipeptide repeats and RG or RGG repeats (for HPV type-5, see Fig. 1). A phylogenetic analysis by comparing the hinge amino acid sequences revealed distinct groupings of E2 proteins encoded by EV-HPVs (data not shown). In one group of EV-HPVs (including HPV-5), the hinge region of E2 is the longest (∼200 aa) among all papillomaviruses and contains most RS repeats (20 in average), whereas the E2 hinge in another group of EV-HPVs is moderate in length (∼150 aa) and contains fewer RS repeats (12 in average). In sharp contrast, the hinge of the E2 protein encoded by non-EV-HPVs is relatively short in length (∼60 aa) and lacks repeated RS or RG sequences (Fig. 1). RS domains are known to be involved in protein-protein interaction between pre-mRNA splicing factors (4Fu X.-D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 5Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 6Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This notion prompted us to ask whether an E2 protein containing the RS-rich hinge could specifically interact with cellular splicing factors that also harbor an RS domain. A mixture of mAb104 reactive SR proteins was isolated from HeLa cells by a two-step salt precipitation as described by Zahler et al. (8Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The SR protein preparation contained six major polypeptides, two of which are of ∼30 kDa (Fig. 2 A,lane 2), as reported (8Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). For Far-Western blot analysis, SR proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, followed by incubation within vitro translated, 35S-labeled HPV-5 or HPV-16 E2 protein. The HPV-5 E2 protein appeared to interact with all members of this set of SR proteins (lane 3), but no significant interaction was detected with the labeled HPV-16 E2 protein (lane 4) or with the HPV-5 E2 deletion mutant lacking the hinge region (data not shown). This result suggests that interactions occur between the HPV-5 E2 protein and SR proteins, likely via their RS domain. We next examined whether the HPV-5 E2 protein could interact with components of spliceosomal snRNPs. Proteins associated with Sm snRNPs were enriched from HeLa cell nuclear extracts by precipitation with 65% saturated (NH4)2SO4, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Sm antibody. snRNP-associated proteins are shown in Fig. 2 B (lane 2). Using35S-labeled HPV-5 E2 protein as a probe, snRNP-associated polypeptides of approximately 100 and 70 kDa were reproducibly detected on Far-Western blots (lanes 6 and 10). The triplet 70-kDa bands probably correspond to U1–70K (lane 4), which is an integral component of the U1 snRNP and contains an arginine alternating domain at the C terminus. Recently, two additional snRNP-associated SR proteins were identified: the 27-kDa protein specific to the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP and the 100-kDa U5 snRNP protein, which is also present in the tri-snRNP complex (22Fetzer S. Lauber J. Will C.L. Luhrmann R. RNA. 1997; 3: 344-355PubMed Google Scholar, 23Teigelkamp S. Mundt C. Achsel T. Will C.L. Luhrmann R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1313-1326PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins contain an RS or an arginine alternating domain at their N terminus. Antiserum against the U5–100kD protein specifically recognized a doublet band in the snRNP protein enriched fraction (lane 8), but not in the mock immunoprecipitate (lane 7). The doublet comigrated with the ∼100-kDa HPV-5 E2-interacting protein (lane 10), suggesting that the U5–100kD protein is possibly the other snRNP-associated protein that can interact with the HPV-5 E2 protein (see below for further analyses). This result therefore suggests that the HPV-5 E2 protein can interact with snRNP-associated proteins, which contain an arginine alternating domain. To examine whether interactions between HPV-5 E2 and SR proteins could occur in solution, we performed in vitro association assay by coimmunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitation efficiency was first evaluated by incubation of the reticulolysate mixture containingin vitro synthesized, 35S-labeled HPV-5 E2 protein (∼0.7 pmol) with anti-E2 antibody-coupled protein A-Sepharose. Approximately 10% of loaded E2 protein was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3, top panel). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, HPV-5 E2 and individual SR proteins were synthesized separately by in vitro translation; only SR proteins but not the E2 protein were labeled with [35S]methionine in order to avoid confusing data resulted from comigration of U1–70K and E2 on SDS-PAGE. The E2 protein was then mixed with an SR protein in the reticulocyte lysate, followed by immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 3 (bottom panel), all four SR proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with the HPV-5 E2 protein by anti-E2 antibodies, but not by control antibodies. However, SR proteins alone failed to be precipitated by anti-E2 antibodies, and the control protein, GAL4-VP16, had no detectable interaction with the E2 protein (Fig. 3, bottom panel), suggesting that the immunoprecipitation of SR proteins can be attributed to their specific association with the HPV-5 E2 protein. Consistent with the results of Far-Western blot analysis, the E2 protein lacking the RS-rich hinge had no significant interaction with ASF/SF2 (data not shown). In summary, the result of the association assay provides additional evidence for in vitro interactions of the HPV-5 E2 protein with at least four cellular RS domain-containing splicing factors. We next examined whether the HPV-5 E2 protein interacts with SR proteins in vivo by the yeast two-hybrid assay. The full-length or hinge-deleted HPV-5 E2 (Fig. 1) was fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain, and SR proteins were fused to the LexA DNA binding domain. Recombinant plasmids as well as the Lac Z reporter were transformed into the yeast strain EGY48 and the transformants were assayed for the β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Table I, the full-length HPV-5 E2 protein interacted with all the tested SR proteins, whereas deletion of the hinge in the E2 protein dramatically reduced its interaction with SR proteins. Western blot analysis using anti-E2 antibodies revealed that the level of the GAL4-E2ΔH fusion protein was severalfold higher than that of the full-length E2 fusion protein (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the RS-rich hinge region of the HPV-5 E2 protein is essential for E2 interactions with RS domain-containing splicing factors. However, in the two-hybrid assay, the two snRNP proteins appeared to have only weak interaction with the E2 protein. This may in part be attributed to the low amount of U1–70K and U5–1"

Activities of at least four E2s were increased in NGF-treated cells, including E2(14K), a component of the N-end rule pathway. Ubiquitylation of 125 I-labeled β-lactoglobulin was up to 4-fold greater in supernatants from NGF-treated cellsversus untreated cells and was selectively inhibited by the dipeptide Leu-Ala, an inhibitor of Ub isopeptide ligase (E3). However, Ub-dependent proteolysis of 125I-labeled β-lactoglobulin was not increased in supernatants from NGF-treated cells, suggesting that neurite outgrowth is promoted by enhanced rates of synthesis (rather than degradation) of Ub-protein conjugates. Consistent with this observation, neurite outgrowth was induced by proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone) and was associated with elevated levels of ubiquitylated protein and stabilization of the Ub-dependent substrate, p53. Lactacystin-induced neurite outgrowth was blocked by the dipeptide Leu-Ala (2 mm) but not by His-Ala. These data 1) demonstrate that the enhanced pool of ubiquitylated protein observed during neuritogenesis in PC12 cells reflects coordinated up-regulation of Ub-conjugating activity, 2) suggest that Ub-dependent proteolysis is a negative regulator of neurite outgrowth in vitro, and 3) support a role for E2(14K)/E3-mediated protein ubiquitylation in PC12 cell neurite outgrowth.

The UPP is a conserved pathway of selective protein modification and degradation that controls levels and activities of many highly regulated eukaryotic proteins, including cyclins, tumor suppressors, receptors, and transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 1Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2Wilkinson K.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Hochstrasser M.

Substrates of the pathway are covalently ligated to one or more monomers of ubiquitin, an 8.5-kDa protein, by the sequential activities of three families of enzymes: Ub-activating enzymes (E1s), Ub carrier proteins (E2s), and Ub-isopeptide ligases (E3s) (2Wilkinson K.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 4Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). The protein moiety of the Ub-protein conjugate can be subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome, a multicatalytic, ATP-dependent protease (reviewed in Ref. 5Rechsteiner M. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 147-181Crossref Google Scholar). Alternatively, the Ub-protein conjugate can be deubiquitylated by Ub isopeptidases, releasing the protein intact (2Wilkinson K.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The best recognized function of ubiquitylation is selective targeting of proteins for rapid degradation (1Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2Wilkinson K.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev.

Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 147-181Crossref Google Scholar); however, evidence for nonproteolytic functions of this process is rapidly emerging (1Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J.

Kanda T. Ohkawa K. Matsuda M. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, determination of photoreceptor cell fate and the guidance of neurite growth cones to synaptic targets are regulated by a deubiquitylating enzyme and a Ub carrier protein (E2), respectively (13Huang Y. Baker R.T. Fischer-Vize J.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 14Oh C.E. McMahon R. Benzer S. Tanouye M.A. J.

Ub-dependent proteolysis may be required for growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in vertebrates. This function of the UPP is suggested by studies that implicate the N-end rule pathway in neuritogenesis (16Hondermarck H. Sy J. Bradshaw R.A. Arfin S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Maufroid J.P. Bradshaw R.A. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 609-611PubMed Google Scholar, 18Taban C.H. Hondermarck H. Bradshaw R.A. Biolly B. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The N-end rule is a set of N-terminal amino acids that govern the susceptibility of certain proteins to Ub-dependent proteolysis (reviewed in Ref. 19Varshavsky A. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the mammalian N-end rule, destabilizing residues include bulky hydrophobic (e.g. Leu, Phe, Trp) or basic amino acids (e.g.Arg, Lys, His). These amino acids are selectively recognized by a bifunctional isopeptide ligase, E3 (20Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E3 facilitates the transfer of Ub from a specific Ub carrier protein, E2(14K), to the substrate (21Sung P. Berleth E. Pickart C. Prakash S. Prakash L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,22Wing S.S. Dumas F. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6495-6501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dipeptides bearing destabilizing N-terminal residues inhibit E3-catalyzed ubiquitylation, thereby inhibiting Ub-dependent degradation of N-end rule substrates (23Baker R.T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1090-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A biological function of the N-end rule has been verified in yeast (24Byrd C. Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).NGF-induced neurite outgrowth from rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells provides a well characterized model of sympathetic neuron differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 25Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar). Neurite outgrowth in this model is believed to require UPP proteolytic activity (16Hondermarck H. Sy J. Bradshaw R.A. Arfin S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a notion that is consistent with increased levels of Ub-protein conjugates and coincident reductions in levels of free Ub that are observed in NGF-treated PC12 cells (12Takada K. Kanda T. Ohkawa K. Matsuda M. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, nothing is currently known about alterations in either UPP enzyme activity or capacities for ubiquitylation and Ub-dependent protein degradation associated with neurite outgrowth in these cells. Novel data presented here demonstrate that neurite outgrowth is coincident with up-regulated activities of Ub-conjugating enzymes and capacity for de novo protein ubiquitylation but not with enhanced capacity for Ub-dependent proteolysis in vitro. Moreover, neurite outgrowth is accelerated by reagents that block Ub-dependent proteolysis, and such induced neurite outgrowth is inhibited by a dipeptide inhibitor of E3- dependent ubiquitylation. These data implicate ubiquitylation and Ub-dependent proteolysis as respective positive and negative regulators of neurite outgrowth.RESULTSThe transition to neuronal morphology in PC12 cells exposed to NGF occurred as described previously (25Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, cells became flattened within 24 h, and neurite outgrowth was apparent after 48 h. The frequency and length of neurites increased with the duration of NGF treatment such that by 5 days of NGF treatment >50% of cells exhibited at least 1 neurite that extended more than 1 cell body length from the cell periphery. Coincident with these NGF-induced morphological changes, levels of high mass Ub-protein conjugates increased >2-fold after 24 h of NGF treatment (Fig.1 A, compare lanes 1and 2), 4-fold after 3 days (Fig. 1 A, comparelanes 3 and 4) and attained maximal levels (≥5-fold increase) after 5 days (Fig. 1 A, comparelanes 5 and 6). Levels of lower mass Ub-protein conjugates also increased in NGF-treated cells, with the exception of a ∼42-kDa species that was more abundant in the absence of NGF (data not shown). In concert with these increases in Ub-protein conjugates, levels of free (nonconjugated) Ub declined up to 3-fold within 48 h of NGF treatment (data not shown). These results confirm that NGF induces neurite outgrowth coincident with the redistribution of cellular Ub from the free to the conjugated pool (12Takada K. Kanda T. Ohkawa K. Matsuda M. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Increased levels of Ub-protein conjugates in NGF-treated cells could be due either to enhanced rates of ubiquitylation or to decreased rates of conjugate degradation or disassembly. To determine whether neurite outgrowth was coincident with enhanced rates of ubiquitylation, supernatant obtained from PC12 cells cultured for 5 days in the presence or absence of NGF was incubated with saturating levels of125I-labeled Ub, ATP, and inhibitors of Ub-dependent proteolysis (MG132) and Ub-protein conjugate deubiquitylation (Ubal). Autoradiography of SDS gels indicates that the radiographic intensity of high mass 125I-labeled Ub-protein conjugates was ≥2-fold greater in supernatants from NGF-treated cells (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Because the incubation time was within the interval during which formation of high mass conjugates was linear (data not shown), these results indicate that the rate of formation of high mass conjugates is elevated in supernatants of NGF-treated PC12 cells.Enhanced rates of ubiquitylation can reflect elevated activities of Ub-conjugating enzymes (E1s, E2s, E3s) as well as increased availability of protein substrates. An in vitro measure of E1 and E2 activities is their capacity to form thiol esters with saturating levels of 125I-labeled Ub (28Haas A.L. Baboshina O. Williams B. Schwartz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9407-9412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because these esters are formed on active-site cysteines, they are labile in the presence of reductants such as mercaptoethanol. We determined that levels of 125I-labeled Ub∼E1s thiol esters (∼125 kDa) and at least four 125I-labeled Ub∼E2s thiol esters (24–40 kDa) were elevated an average of 40–50% in supernatants from NGF-treated cells (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 1 and2). It is unlikely that these results reflect decreased ability of E2s to transfer Ub to E3s, because rates of de novo protein ubiquitylation were elevated after NGF treatment (Fig. 1 B). We therefore conclude that activities of Ub-conjugating enzymes are elevated in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. This NGF-associated enhancement of Ub-conjugating enzyme activities provides one mechanism to account for the enhanced pool of Ub-protein conjugates and the increased capacity for de novo protein ubiquitylation in PC12 cells during growth factor induced neuritogenesis (Figs. 1, A and B).The electrophoretic mobility of the 24-kDa 125I-labeled Ub∼E2 thiol ester (Fig. 1 C, *) suggested that it contained E2(14K). This was confirmed based on comigration of this 24-kDa125I-labeled Ub thiol ester with the125I-labeled Ub thiol ester formed with recombinant E2(14K) (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and2, arrow). The higher mass radiolabeled band in the sample containing recombinant E2(14K) (Fig. 2, lane 1) is a partially unfolded electrophoretic variant of125I-labeled Ub∼E2(14K) (29Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13268-13275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of radiolabel in the presence of reductant (Fig. 2, lane 4) confirms that these radiolabeled species are thiol esters. In conjunction with the demonstration of up-regulated E2 activities in NGF-treated cells (Fig.1 C), verification that the 24-kDa 125I-labeled Ub∼E2 thiol ester contains E2(14K) provides evidence that E2(14K) activity is enhanced in supernatant from NGF-treated PC12 cells.Figure 2The 24-kDa 125I-labeled Ub∼E2 thiol ester generated in PC12 cell supernatant contains E2(14K). Thiol ester assays were conducted as above with supernatant from PC12 cells cultured without NGF. Samples were electrophoresed in the absence (lanes 1 and 2) or presence (lane 4) of reductant (2-mercaptoethanol (BME)). Lane 1, 125I-labeled Ub∼E2(14K) formed in the presence of supplemental (recombinant) E2(14K). The higher mass species of 125I-labeled Ub∼E2(14K) (*) is an electrophoretic variant with a slightly greater stokes radius. The ∼16-kDa radiolabeled band is125I-labeled di-Ub. Lane 2, endogenous125I-labeled Ub∼E2 thiol ester ([125I]Ub∼E2(14K). Lane 3, contains no sample (as in Fig. 1C). Lane 4, destruction of125I-labeled Ub∼E2(14K) by reductant confirms the [125I]Ub∼E2 thiol ester linkage. The molecular mass markers are at right. The representative experiment shown is one of three.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To assess whether enhanced E2(14K) activity associated with PC12 cell neurite outgrowth is sufficient to up-regulate E3-dependent protein ubiquitylation, we incubated the N-end rule substrate,125I-labeled β-lactoglobulin (16Hondermarck H. Sy J. Bradshaw R.A. Arfin S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with PC12 supernatants and determined the level of ubiquitylated substrate at steady state. To confirm that ubiquitylation was E3-dependent in these experiments, some assays included either a dipeptide (Leu-Ala) to block E3 binding to the bulky hydrophobic N terminus (leucine) of the substrate (20Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Byrd C. Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or a control dipeptide (Ala-Leu). SDS-PAGE and autoradiography verify the formation of ubiquitylated 125I-labeled β-lactoglobulin, evident as a ladder of radiolabel migrating above the substrate at progressively higher 8.5-kDa increments (∼28 kDa, ∼36 kDa) and as a smear of higher mass radiolabel in overexposed autoradiograms (Fig.3, lanes 2–5). When adjusted for total substrate (cpm) per assay tube, the intensity of these radiolabeled bands was 2–4 times greater in supernatants from NGF-treated cells, indicating that these supernatants had an enhanced capacity to ubiquitylate the exogenous substrate (Fig. 3, comparelanes 2 and 3). Consistent with an E3-dependent mechanism, the dipeptide Leu-Ala inhibited the formation of ubiquitylated 125I-labeled β-lactoglobulin by 70% in supernatant from NGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 3, comparelane 5 with lanes 3 and 4) and nonstimulated cells (data not shown). The control dipeptide Ala-Leu was also slightly (10–15%) inhibitory (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3and 4).Figure 3Ubiquitylation of125I-labeled β-lactoglobulin is up-regulated in supernatant from NGF-treated PC12 cells. 125I-Labeled β-lactoglobulin (4 μg, 7 × 105 cpm/μg) (lane 1) was incubated with supernatant from PC12 cells cultured in the absence (lane 2) or presence (lanes 3–5) of NGF (100 ng/ml, 5d). The dipeptides Ala-Leu (lane 4) or Leu-Ala (lane 5) were added to some assays (20 mm final concentration) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Theboxed area of the autoradiogram is overexposed to reveal higher mass bands. The radiolabeled band at ∼38 kDa is a contaminant or aggregated form of the substrate comprising ≤2% of the substrate (lane 1).

One of two independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next determined if enhanced protein ubiquitylation in NGF-treated cells was reflected in enhanced rates of Ub-dependent proteolysis. We incubated 125I-labeled β-lactoglobulin in ATP- and Ub-supplemented supernatants from PC12 cells that had been cultured in the presence or absence of NGF, and we determined the proportion of substrate that was degraded to acid-soluble cpm. The percent of 125I-labeled β-lactoglobulin that was degraded by the UPP in vitro was not significantly different in supernatants from NGF-treated cells relative to nontreated cells (Fig.4). Thus, the capacity for substrate degradation by the UPP did not increase in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells commensurate with enhanced rates of substrate ubiquitylation (Fig.3).Figure 4Ub-dependent proteolysis of125I-labeled β-lactoglobulin is not up-regulated in supernatant from NGF-treated PC12 cells. 125I-Labeled β-lactoglobulin was incubated in PC12 cell supernatants as in Fig. 3. Substrate degradation was determined after 30 min as acid-soluble radioactivity. Rates of proteolysis remained linear during the incubation period. Ub-dependent proteolysis was determined as the proportion of total degradation that was ATP-dependent and inhibitable by MG132. One of two independent experiments performed in triplicate is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Subsequent experiments assessed the roles of ubiquitylation and Ub-dependent proteolysis in neurite outgrowth. First, we induced neurite outgrowth with the proteasome inhibitor,clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (30Omura S. Matsuzaki K. Fujimoto T. Kosuge K. Fuzuya T. Fujita S. Nakagawa A. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1991; 44: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 31Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Reichard G.A. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3358-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Within 2 h of exposure to the inhibitor, most PC12 cells became flattened, and neuritogenesis was observed as the extension of small neurite buds (data not shown). After 6–12 h of treatment, >50% of cells treated with clasto-lactacystin β-lactone had extended one or more neurites, whereas <0.5% of control cells extended neurites (Fig.5 A, compare panels a and b). Cells treated withclasto-lactacystin β-lactone remained viable for at least 48 h, during which time neurites increased in frequency and length. Significantly, neurite outgrowth was coincident with inhibition of Ub-dependent proteolysis, as evidenced by the accumulation in cells treated with clasto-lactacystin β-lactone of endogenous Ub-protein conjugates (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 1 and 2) and the UPP substrate, p53 (32Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3429) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Accumulation of Ub-protein conjugates was maximal in the presence of 5 μm clasto-lactacystin β-lactone. These results demonstrate that neurite outgrowth can be rapidly induced in PC12 cells coincident with (at least partial) inhibition of Ub-dependent proteolysis.Figure 5Induction of neurite outgrowth by proteasome inhibitors is coincident with inhibition of Ub-dependent proteolysis.

Cells were harvested in SDS-PAGE sample buffer after 6 h, at which time >50% of the cells had extended neurites (as in Fig. 5 A, bottom panel). Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against Ub-protein conjugates (lanes 1 and2) or against p53 (lanes 3 and 4; see “Experimental Procedures”). Molecular mass markers are at right. One of two representative experiments is presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we tested the effect of dipeptides on lactacystin-induced neurite outgrowth. The dipeptides used were Leu-Ala, which competes for the E3 hydrophobic site, and His-Ala, directed aginst the E3 basic site. In the initial experiments, cells pretreated with lactacystin (10 μm, 2 h) were incubated with either Leu-Ala (2 mm) or vehicle, and the proportion of cells that failed to extend neurites was measured after an additional 4 h of incubation (See “Experimental Procedures”). Incubation with Leu-Ala increased the proportion of cells that failed to extend neurites by almost 2-fold (32% ± 1% versus 17% ± 1%, p < 0.003,n = 2 experiments performed in quadruplicate). Subsequent experiments assessed the effect of dipeptides on the lengthening of elaborated neurites. Neurite outgrowth was induced by a 4-h pretreatment of cells with lactacystin followed by the addition of dipeptides, incubation for 20 h, and the quantification of cells with neurites greater than or equal to the length of the cell body. In these studies, the proportion of cells exhibiting neurites greater than or equal to the length of the cell body was reduced by 3-fold (15%versus 5%) in cultures treated with Leu-Ala as compared with control cultures (no dipeptide) (p < 0.001; Fig.6, A and B). In contrast, the proportion of cells with neurites greater than or equal to the length of the cell body was not reduced in the presence of His-Ala (p > 0.05; Fig. 6, A andC). The selective inhibitory effect of Leu-Ala suggests that lactacystin-induced neurite outgrowth requires ubiquitylation of a subset of N-end rule substrate(s).Figure 6The dipeptide Leu-Ala selectively inhibits neurite outgrowth induced by proteasome inhibition. A, neurite outgrowth was induced by exposing PC12 cells to 10 μmlactacystin for 4 h, followed by the addition of either buffer sham (panel a), 2 mm Leu-Ala (panel b), or 2 mm His-Ala (panel c). After an additional 20 h of incubation, the proportion PC12 cells (mean ±S.E.) with neurites greater than or equal to cell-body length was counted (arrows). B, histogram of neurite outgrowth data.

Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 147-181Crossref Google Scholar). In this work we demonstrate that growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth is associated with up-regulated activity of E2(14K) (Figs.1 C and 2) and enhanced capacity for E2(14K)/E3-dependent protein ubiquitylation (Fig. 3) but not with increased capacity for Ub-dependent proteolysis of E2(14K)/E3-dependent substrates (Fig. 4). We propose that the enhanced pool of ubiquitylated protein observed in NGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 12Takada K. Kanda T. Ohkawa K. Matsuda M. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) results from elevated rates of protein ubiquitylation in the absence of comparable increases in rates of Ub-dependent proteolysis or rates of conjugate disassembly by isopeptidases.The enhanced capacity for protein ubiquitylation in NGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 1, A and B) appears to reflect globally up-regulated activities of Ub-conjugating enzymes (E1s and E2s) (Fig. 1 C).

Although a number of metabolic functions of HDL have been identified, no direct link has been established between HDL functions and its antiatherogenic effect (1Vega G.L. Grundy S.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that apolipoprotein (apo)A-I, the major HDL apolipoprotein, activates reverse cholesterol transport from extrahepatic tissues to the liver (2Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, conflicting results have been reported concerning the role of apoA-II, the second most abundant HDL apolipoprotein (3Schultz J.R. Rubin E.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Rader D.J. Ikewaki K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Studies of transgenic mice overexpressing human apoA-I and apoA-II reported that apoA-I protected more against aortic lesions than apoA-II (3Schultz J.R. Rubin E.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HDL from transgenic mice overexpressing mouse apoA-II lost the ability of HDL to protect against low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation (5Banka C.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and was even proinflammatory (6Castellani L.W. Navab M. Van Lenten B.J. Hedrick C.C. Hama S.Y. Goto A.M. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J.

At present, apoA-II has been linked with HDL metabolism only, but its exact role remains to be elucidated. Studies of transgenic mice expressing human (10Schultz J.R. Gong E.L. McCall M.R.

Invest. 1994; 94: 2457-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the present work we were interested in studying the metabolic effects of human apoA-II overexpression under ad libitumfeeding conditions. The two transgenic lines we generated were characterized by marked hypertriglyceridemia that was proportional to the level of human apoA-II expression (2 and 4 times the normal in human and mouse serum, respectively). To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this drastic VLDL increase, we focused on the two possible causes for VLDL accumulation in the circulation: greater hepatic VLDL production and/or decreased catabolism by lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of the 3-kilobase genomic clone of the human apoA-II gene (−911/+2045), subcloned into the HindIIIsite of pUC19 (17Lopez J. Roghani A. Bertrand J. Zanni E. Kalopissis A. Zannis V.I. Chambaz J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4056-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), into one-cell embryos of (C57BL/6J × CBA/2J) F1 female mice (IFFA-CREDO, Lyon, France). The two founder mice were then backcrossed to strain C57BL/6J, and the majority of the transgenic mice used in this study were obtained after four or five backcrosses. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA was performed using as a probe a 1,273-base pair fragment obtained by PstI digestion, which is specific for the human apoA-II gene. Approximately 7 and 25 copies of the human apoA-II gene were integrated, respectively, into the genome of lines hAIItg-δ and -λ. The animals were housed in animal rooms with alternating 12-h periods of light (7 a.m.–7 p.m.) and dark (7 p.m.–7 a.m.) and were fed a chow diet (UAR, Villemoisson-sur-Orge). The presence of the transgene was detected by polymerase chain reaction of tail-derived DNA, and human apoA-II was also measured in plasma by immunonephelometry using an antibody (IMMUNO-AG) specific for human apoA-II and not recognizing mouse apoA-II. All transgenic mice were hemizygous for the transgene and were more than 8 weeks old. Because most studies were performed with pooled plasma, we discarded nontransgenic littermates to exclude misidentifications and used as controls C57BL/6J mice (IFFA-CREDO) of the same age and maintained under the same nutritional conditions. Male and female mice were used in equal proportions. In all experiments, mice with free access to food and water were bled between 9 and 12 a.m., either from the retroorbital venous plexus or from the abdominal vein. Total RNA was isolated from several tissues using RNA Instapure kit (Eurogentech). RNA samples (15 μg) were separated in 3% formaldehyde-containing agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were hybridized to the human apoA-II cDNA probe. The 18 S RNA probe was used as an internal standard. Autoradiograms were scanned and analyzed with the NIH Image program. Blood was collected into EDTA-containing tubes on ice and plasma supplemented with 0.005% gentamycin, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.04% sodium azide and protease inhibitors. Chylomicrons were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 20 °C and washed once by ultracentrifugation for 18 h at 100,000 × g and 10 °C to eliminate albumin. Then, sequential ultracentrifugations were performed at 100,000 × g and 10 °C to isolate VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and LDL (for 18 h at densities 1.006, 1.020, and 1.063 g/ml, respectively) and HDL (for 40 h at density 1.21 g/ml). LDL and HDL were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The protein content of lipoproteins was measured (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and triglyceride (Biotrol A 01548), total cholesterol (Biotrol A 01368), free cholesterol (Biotrol A 01371), and phospholipid (BioMérieux PAP 150) contents were determined with commercial kits. Fast protein liquid chromatography was performed on 0.2 ml of pooled plasma, using two Superose 6 columns operating in series. The elution rate was 0.4 ml/min. 0.2-ml fractions were collected into 96-well microplates, and the TG and total cholesterol contents were determined in each tube. The size distribution of HDL was analyzed by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in 4–15% polyacrylamide gels (precast, Bio-Rad). The HMW Calibration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for calibration of HDL particle size (19Nichols A.V. Kraus R.M. Musliner T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Apolipoproteins were analyzed by 5 and 15% SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207180) Google Scholar) and 4–20% SDS-PAGE (precast gels, Bio-Rad), under nonreducing conditions to detect the dimeric form of human apoA-II. The gels were scanned, analyzed with the NIH Image program, and the percentages of the various apolipoproteins were calculated. The isoforms of human apoA-II and the proportions of apoC-II and apoC-III were determined by isoelectric focusing (IEF) electrophoresis. Gels with a pH range of 3–5 containing 8 m urea (Ultrapure, Bio-Rad), 7.5% acrylamide, 0.2% bisacrylamide, and 2% Ampholines 3–5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were run at 4 °C, with voltage increasing in a stepwise fashion: 200 V for 10 min, 400 V for 10 min, and 600 V for 4 h 30 min. The presence of human apoA-II in lipoproteins from transgenic mice was verified by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE and IEF. After protein transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad), human apoA-II was detected by a rabbit antihuman apoA-II antiserum that does not recognize mouse apoA-II (courtesy of Dr. A. Mazur, INRA, Theix). ApoC-II and apoC-III were detected by immunoblotting IEF gels with rabbit antiserum directed against total mouse apoCs (Interchim). Bands were visualized with an alkaline phosphatase substrate system (Bio-Rad). Control and transgenic mice fedad libitum were studied between 10:00 a.m. and noon. An equal number of control, hAIItg-δ, and hAIItg-λ mice were studied on any given day. Mice were injected into the jugular vein with Triton WR 1339 (500 mg/kg, as described in Ref. 21Otway S. Robinson D.S. J. Physiol. 1967; 190: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and 5 min later, with 4 μCi of [1-14C]oleic acid complexed to albumin, to label newly synthesized VLDL-TG (22Francone O.L. Kalopissis A.D. Griffaton G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Four blood samples were taken from each mouse: at 0 min (before Triton) and 30, 50, and 70 min after Triton. Plasma VLDL clearance in mice is essentially completely inhibited under these conditions, so that the accumulation of [14C]TG in plasma between 0 and 70 min post-Triton reflects VLDL-TG production rate. Plasma samples were extracted for lipids (23Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and lipid classes were separated by TLC and counted (22Francone O.L. Kalopissis A.D. Griffaton G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Total TG was determined with a commercial kit. Heparin (Choay, France) was injected into the jugular vein of fed transgenic and control mice (500 units/kg). Blood was collected 5 min later into EDTA-containing tubes on ice, and plasma was stored at −80 °C up until the assays. Lipolytic activities were assayed in triplicate using a radiolabeled triolein emulsion (24Nilsson-Ehle P. Ekman R. Artery. 1977; 3: 194-209Google Scholar). Total and LPL activities were measured in the absence of 1m NaCl and in the presence of human heat-inactivated serum as a source of apoC-II. HL was measured separately on another triolein emulsion optimal for this enzyme (24Nilsson-Ehle P. Ekman R. Artery. 1977; 3: 194-209Google Scholar) in the presence of 1m NaCl to inhibit LPL activity. LPL was calculated by subtraction. One milliunit of activity is defined as the amount that generates 1 nmol of free fatty acids/min at 37 °C. Plasma LPL and HL activities were expressed as milliunits/ml of plasma. LPL activity was measured directly in muscle (heart, diaphragm, and gastrocnemian muscle) and adipose tissues (brown and interscapular), which were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C up until the assays. Tissues were homogenized at 4 °C in 0.223 m Tris, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.008% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.05% heparin, 1% albumin, pH 8.3, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and LPL activity was measured on supernatants as described above (24Nilsson-Ehle P. Ekman R. Artery. 1977; 3: 194-209Google Scholar). 5 μl of pooled postheparin plasma from control mice was incubated with the LPL-specific or the HL-specific emulsions, as described above. Postheparin plasma was preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min without apoA-II or with the specified amounts of purified human apoA-II (Sigma). Mice were injected in the jugular vein with 5 μCi of [1-14C]oleic acid (ICN, Irvine, CA) complexed to albumin, and blood was collected 60 min later. Plasma was ultracentrifuged to isolate chylomicrons, VLDL, and IDL. Lipoproteins were analyzed by TLC (22Francone O.L. Kalopissis A.D. Griffaton G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to ensure that 85–90% of the label was in the TG fraction. Lipoproteins were incubated at 0.03, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8 mm TG concentrations with 10 μg of LPL (recombinant, Sigma; specific activity 8,600 milliunits/ml) for 20 min in 100 mm Tris/HCl and 4% fatty acid-free albumin, pH 8.2. Blank samples without LPL were performed for each concentration, and the difference was regarded as the hydrolyzed amount of TG. Reactions were stopped and free fatty acids extracted as described in Ref. 24Nilsson-Ehle P. Ekman R. Artery. 1977; 3: 194-209Google Scholar. Rates of lipolysis under these experimental conditions were linear for all lipoprotein preparations (not shown). Apparent Michaelis constants (K m) and maximal enzyme activities (V max) for LPL were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Results are given as the mean ± S.E., and differences were determined by the t test for nonpaired samples after analysis of variance, using GraphPad Prism. Linear regression analyses for post-Triton TG production rates were performed using GraphPad Prism and the slopes of the regression lines were compared by unpaired t test. Fig.1 illustrates Northern blot analysis of mRNA prepared from several tissues. Expression of human apoA-II was restricted to liver, as expected (10Schultz J.R. Gong E.L. McCall M.R. Nichols A.V.

Despite similar relative amounts of human apoA-II mRNA to 18 S (2.6 and 1.9 in lines δ and λ, respectively), the human apoA-II concentration in plasma was 56 and 116 mg/dl in mice δ and λ, respectively, suggesting that the higher plasma human apoA-II in line λ resulted from post-transcriptional regulation or decreased clearance. The two transgenic lines permitted us to study in the fed state a gradient of human apoA-II expression corresponding to 2 and 4 times the apoA-II concentration in normal human plasma (30 mg/dl) or in plasma of control mice (25 mg/dl, according to Ref. 8Plump A.S. Azrolan N. Odaka H. Wu L. Jiang X. Tall A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1033-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A strong correlation between plasma apoA-II and TG concentrations was found in fed transgenic mice over a wide range of values (r = 0.81; p < 0.01). To establish whether the hypertriglyceridemia depended on nutritional status, we measured plasma apoA-II and TG levels in the same animals fed ad libitum or fasted for 18 h. Although hypertriglyceridemia occurred essentially in the fed state, higher fasting plasma TG persisted in the higher expressing hAIItg-λ mice (TableI).Table IPlasma concentrations of human apoA-II and triglyceride in the same mice under ad libitum feeding or after an 18-h fastGroupTriglycerideHuman apoA-IImg/dlmg/dlFedControls55.6 ± 7.8NDaND, not determined.hAIItg-δ747.8 ± 133.0bp < 0.001 between transgenic and control mice with same nutritional status.54.5 ± 2.3hAIItg-λ1232.3 ± 124.9bp < 0.001 between transgenic and control mice with same nutritional status.104.6 ± 22.3cp < 0.05 between hAIItg-δ and -λ mice with same nutritional status.FastedControls37.2 ± 3.9NDhAIItg-δ66.4 ± 22.1dp < 0.001 between fed and fasted state in hAIItg-δ and -λ mice.35.4 ± 4.2ep < 0.05 between fed and fasted state in hAIItg-δ mice.hAIItg-λ210.1 ± 47.3 b,c,d48.6 ± 7.0The same six animals from each group were bled from the retroorbital plexus at two separate occasions.

Fast protein liquid chromatographic analysis showed very large increases in the VLDL fractions of both TG and cholesterol and the presence of intermediate sized particles up to the LDL fraction, especially in the higher expressing line λ (Fig.2). HDL decreased substantially in both transgenic lines (Fig. 2). The HDL-cholesterol peak is not apparent in hAIItg-λ mice because of the large scale used due to their high VLDL-TG values. Lipoprotein isolation by sequential ultracentrifugation confirmed the 3-fold decrease in plasma HDL of transgenic mice (TableIII). Surprisingly, this HDL had an increased TG/protein ratio, whereas the ratios of free cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and phospholipid to HDL-protein were 2 times lower. The net result was a lower ratio of HDL-total lipid/HDL-protein in transgenic mice, indicative of decreased particle size. Indeed, nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that HDL of our transgenic mice comprised two populations, both smaller than control mouse HDL (Fig. 3 A), as reported for other human apoA-II-expressing transgenic mouse lines (10Schultz J.R.

We have investigated the role of these glycoproteins on activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex induced by platelet adhesion to type I fibrillar and monomeric collagen under static conditions. In the presence of Mg2+, platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen induced activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex and complete spreading. Anti-α2β1 integrin and anti-GP VI antibodies inhibited the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex by about 40 and 50%, respectively, at 60 min although minimal inhibitory effects on adhesion were seen. Platelet spreading was markedly reduced by anti-α2β1 integrin antibody. The combination of anti-α2β1 integrin with anti-GP VI antibody completely inhibited both platelet adhesion and activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex. Anti-CD36 antibody had no significant effects on platelet adhesion, spreading, and the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex at 60 min. Aspirin and the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist SQ29548 inhibited activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex about 30% but had minimal inhibitory effect on adhesion. In the absence of Mg2+, there was significant activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex but minimal spreading was observed. Anti-GP VI antibody completely inhibited adhesion whereas no effect was observed with anti-α2β1 integrin antibody. Anti-CD36 antibody partially inhibited both adhesion and the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex. Platelet adhesion to monomeric collagen, which requires Mg2+ and is exclusively mediated by α2β1 integrin, resulted in partial activation of the GPIIb-IIIa complex and spreading. No significant effects were observed by anti-CD36 and anti-GP VI antibodies. These results suggest that both α2β1 integrin and GP VI are involved in inside-out signaling leading to activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex after platelet adhesion to collagen and generation of thromboxane A2 may further enhance expression of activated GP IIb-IIIa complexes. α2β1 integrin, CD36, and GP VI have all been implicated in platelet-collagen adhesive interactions.

Although several of these components, such as laminin, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor, all provide a suitable substrate for platelet adhesion, fibrillar collagen is the most thrombogenic constituent of the vascular subendothelium since it supports not only adhesion but also causes platelet activation leading to platelet aggregation (1Baumgartner H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1977; 37: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hawiger J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 509: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because platelet-platelet interactions are primarily mediated by the simultaneous binding of the multivalent adhesive glycoproteins fibrinogen and/or von Willebrand factor to activated GP1IIb-IIIa complexes on two different platelets, collagen must ultimately operate by effecting the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complexes on an adhered platelet to either capture or serve as docking site for a circulating platelet.Three GPs, namely α2β1 integrin (GPIa-IIa), CD36 (GPIV, also known as GPIIIb), and GP VI have been implicated in platelet-collagen adhesive interactions, however, the roles of these GPs on the adhesion-induced expression of activated GP IIb-IIIa complexes are not fully understood.Four patients have been described with mild bleeding diathesis attributable to deficient expression of α2-integrin and platelets from these patients had impaired collagen-induced aggregation but aggregated normally to other agonists (3Nieuwenhuis H.K.

Anti-CD36 antibodies have been shown to partly inhibit platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen under both static and flow conditions (7Tandon N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol.

However, platelets from Naka-negative donors which constitutively lack CD36 have been shown to aggregate normally to collagen (10Yamamoto N. Akamatsu N. Yamazaki H. Tanoue K. Br. J.

Analysis of membrane glycoproteins in these patients revealed that their platelets either lacked GP VI or had very little of it. Thus far, lack of either α2β1 integrin or GP VI in patients has been associated with impaired platelet aggregation in response to collagen. These results imply that both α2β1 integrin and GP VI have definite roles in activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex after platelet binding to collagen. Clinical studies also suggested that more than a single partial defect is required for a disorder of collagen platelet interaction to become clinically important (17Beer J.H. Rabaglio M. Berchtold P. von Felten A. Clemetson K.J. Tsakiris D.A. Kehrel B. Brandenberger S. Blood. 1993; 82: 820-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that GP VI-deficient platelets bind some fibrinogen in response to collagen without aggregation, suggesting that collagen may induce some signaling via α2β1 integrin, leading to the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex (18Kehrel B. Wierwille S. Clemetson K.J. Anders O. Steiner M. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Okuma M. Barnes M.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 491-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, another collagen receptor has recently been identified in human platelets. A recombinant receptor protein (54 kDa), obtained by using a prokaryotic expression system, reacted specifically with type I collagen but not with type III collagen (19Chiang T.M. Rinaldy A. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).A large number of investigators have examined the collagen-induced platelet activation process including the expression of activated GP IIb-IIIa complex during collagen-induced aggregation of washed platelets in suspension or during perfusion of whole blood over collagen-coated coverslips. Three excellent reviews have appeared in the past year (20Sixma J.J. van Zanten G.H. Huizinga E.G. van der Plas R.M. Verkley M. Wu Y.P. Gros P. de Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Moroi M. Jung S.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Barnes M.J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, time-dependent changes in the expression of activated GP IIb-IIIa complex during platelet adhesion to immobilized collagen under static conditions have not been studied in detail. We recently showed the role of GP VI in divalent cation-independent platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen under static conditions and its direct association with the adhesion-induced thromboxane A2 (TXA2) generating system (9Nakamura T. Jamieson G.A. Okuma M. Kambayashi J. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Using our static adhesion assay, we have now investigated the role of α2β1 integrin, CD36, and GP VI on the expression of activated GP IIb-IIIa complexes on platelets adhered to type I fibrillar and monomeric collagens. We simultaneously measured adhesion rate and the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complexes by employing 125I-PAC-1 which binds only to the activated forms of the GP IIb-IIIa complexes (23Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, by using confocal laser scanning microscopy, we were able to visualize adhesion-induced changes in the morphology of platelets and distribution of activated GP IIb-IIIa complexes as detected by FITC-labeled PAC-1. Our results clearly demonstrate that platelet adhesion to immobilized collagen can directly induce the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex and this inside-out signaling is mediated by both α2β1 integrin and GP VI.DISCUSSIONThe accessibility of activated GP IIb-IIIa complexes on the surface of platelets adhered to a damaged vessel plays a crucial role in subsequent platelet recruitment to a thrombus. In this study, we have investigated the role of collagen receptors, namely α2β1 integrin, CD36, and GP VI, on the expression of activated GP IIb-IIIa complexes induced by platelet adhesion to type I fibrillar and monomeric collagen under static conditions.Platelet adhesion to monomeric collagen requires Mg2+ and is exclusively mediated by α2β1 integrin and there is no significant role of CD36 or GP VI in this interaction. Platelets adhered to monomeric collagen neither secrete their granule content nor generate TXA2 (9Nakamura T. Jamieson G.A. Okuma M. Kambayashi J. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, these platelets show significant spreading and induce activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex although this expression is about 40% less than adhesion to fibrillar collagen. This is consistent with the earlier report which showed the binding of thromboerythrocytes to platelets adhered to type I rat skin collagen (25Coller B.S. Kutok J.L. Scudder L.E. Galanakis D.K. West S.M. Rudomen G.S. Springer K.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2796-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that α2β1 integrin-mediated inside-out signaling is able to induce partial platelet spreading and partial activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex. Monomeric collagen effectively supports platelet adhesion, whereas polymerization of monomeric collagen is required to induce platelet aggregation and secretion (26Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 27Muggli R. Baumgartner H.R. Thromb. Res. 1973; 3: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Jaffe R. Deykin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 53: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Brass L.F. Bensusan H.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13899-13903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations may be explained by the fact that the number of activated GP IIb-IIIa complexes and their localization induced by monomeric collagen is not sufficient to elicit a full aggregatory response.Platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen is composed of Mg2+-dependent and -independent adhesion (9Nakamura T. Jamieson G.A. Okuma M. Kambayashi J. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,31Zijenah L.S. Morton L.F. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the presence of Mg2+, platelets adhered to fibrillar collagen showed full spreading and increased activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex than that of platelets adhered to monomeric collagen. Resting platelets have been shown to have approximately 50,000 molecules of GP IIb-IIIa complex on their surface. Upon activation with strong agonist such as thrombin, this number increases to 100,000 sites per platelet, probably reflecting the recruitment from the internal pool of GP IIb-IIIa complex (23Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Van Willigen G. Akkerman J.-W.N. Blood. 1992; 79: 82-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the maximum number of PAC-1-binding sites on activated platelets under saturating conditions has been reported to be only 25,000 sites per platelet (23Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Mg2+, platelets adherent to fibrillar collagen at the 60-min time point bound about 12,000125I-PAC-1 molecules per platelet. This number is about half of the total PAC-1-binding sites as determined by thrombin stimulation (23Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our confocal images, PAC-1 binding was observed only on the nonadhered surface of the platelets; no apparent PAC-1 binding was observed by Z-sectioning or vertical images (X-Z sectioning) on the side of the cell adhering to collagen fibers (data not shown). Thus our PAC-1 binding data may reflect only one side surface expression of the activated GP IIb-IIIa complex. In our previous report (9Nakamura T. Jamieson G.A. Okuma M. Kambayashi J. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we measured both α- and dense granule secretion during platelet adhesion and found that only fibrillar collagen can induce these granules secretion (50% in the presence of Mg2+). Therefore, the increased number of PAC-1-binding sites on platelets adherent to fibrillar collagen may partly reflect the recruitment of the GP IIb-IIIa complex originating from internal pools.Anti-α2β1 integrin antibody inhibited activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex about 40% and significantly inhibited but did not eliminate platelet spreading. These results confirm that α2β1 integrin-mediated signaling is partly responsible for the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex and platelet spreading once platelets have adhered to fibrillar collagen. The mechanism of platelet spreading which is not attributable to α2β1 integrin remains to be elucidated. It has been reported that α2β1integrin-deficient platelets were not able to spread on collagen and collagen failed to induce platelet aggregation (3Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkerman J.W. Houdijk W.P. Sixma J.J. Nature. 1985; 318: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 4Kehrel B. Balleisen L. Kokott R. Mesters R. Stenzinger W. Clemetson K.J. van de Loo J. Blood. 1988; 71: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Handa M. Watanabe K. Kawai Y. Kamata T. Koyama T. Nagai H. Ikeda Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the presence of anti-α2β1 integrin antibody, collagen-induced platelet aggregation was also abolished (5Deckmyn H. Chew S.L. Vermylen J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 74-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, it could be concluded that platelet spreading on collagen fibers is mainly mediated by α2β1 integrin and that nearly full activation of the GP IIb-IIIa is required for platelet aggregation induced by collagen. It is also possible that α2β1 integrin may be necessary for an initial tethering of floating platelets to the collagen fiber (22Barnes M.J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,34Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Morton L.F.

Blood. 1998; 91: 3808-3816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In our previous study, Mg2+-independent adhesion was studied in the presence of EDTA to chelate any Mg2+ arising from the impurities of the reagents used to make Tyrode-HEPES buffer (9Nakamura T. Jamieson G.A. Okuma M. Kambayashi J. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In order to remove Mg2+ and other divalent cations from the buffer, we used Chelex 100. Divalent cations were added as needed. The results of our previous study indicated that divalent cation-independent adhesion amounts to about one-fourth of the adhesion observed in the presence of Mg2+. Using the chelation method we found that Mg2+-independent adhesion was about half that seen in the presence of Mg2+ suggesting that EDTA, even at only 50 μm concentration, can affect platelet adhesion. The results of this study, as well as our earlier study, clearly show that in the absence of Mg2+ platelets adhered to fibrillar collagen and this interaction is mainly dependent on GP VI and there seems to be no role of α2β1 integrin. Platelets adhered to fibrillar collagen in the absence of Mg2+ do secrete and generate TXA2 (9Nakamura T. Jamieson G.A. Okuma M. Kambayashi J. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although this interaction does not induce platelet spreading, apparent activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex was observed. In the presence of Mg2+, anti-GP VI Fabs also inhibited the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex by about 50% and platelet spreading was slightly inhibited. These results suggest that GP VI-mediated signaling also plays an important role in adhesion-induced activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex. GP VI-deficient platelets failed to aggregate in response to collagen (13Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 14Arai M. Yamamoto N. Moroi M. Akamatsu N. Fukutake K. Tanoue K. Br. J.

Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-GP VI Fabs also abolished collagen-induced platelet aggregation (16Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study under flow conditions has shown that GP VI-deficient platelets exhibit almost normal primary adhesion to collagen fibers but that platelet aggregates formation is abrogated (38Moroi M. Jung S.M. Shinmyozu K. Tomiyama Y. Ordinas A. Diaz-Ricart M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the role of GP VI and the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex.Although G proteins, intracellular calcium, protein kinases, and many other proteins are thought to be involved in the expression of activated GP IIb-IIIa complex, the exact mechanisms that control the expression of activated GP IIb-IIIa complex are still obscure (39Kroll M.H. Schafer A.I. Blood. 1989; 74: 1181-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that activation of platelets stimulated by collagen is mediated through a tyrosine kinase pathway that involves the Fc receptor γ chain, Syk, and phospholipase Cγ2 (41Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 42Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Law C.L. Watson S.P. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated phospholipase Cγ2 becomes activated leading to the generation of inositol triphosphate and elevation of intracellular Ca2+. These phosphorylation events seem to be mediated by both α2β1 integrin and GP VI (44Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28029-28036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 45Keely P.J. Parise L.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 63-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In other words, α2β1 integrin- and GP VI-mediated signaling converge on intracellular Ca2+elevation. In fact, it has been shown that collagen directly induces a rise in cytosolic calcium in single human platelets (48Poole A.W. Watson S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The intracellular Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA, inhibited125PAC-1 binding in a dose-dependent manner although it does not itself affect platelet adhesion, 2T. Nakamura, J-i. Kambayashi, M. Okuma, and N. N. Tandon, unpublished observations. suggesting that intracellular Ca2+ seems to be a key second messenger for the inside-out signaling leading to the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex. Further experiments are currently underway to elucidate the relationship between intracellular calcium ion and the expression of activated GP IIb-IIIa complexes.We have previously reported that platelets adhered to fibrillar collagen are able to secrete dense and α granule contents and generate TXA2: in particular TXA2 generation was found to be directly associated with GP VI (9Nakamura T. Jamieson G.A. Okuma M. Kambayashi J. Tandon N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TXA2, ADP, and serotonin are considered as positive feedback agonists in that they bind back to platelets and synergistically potentiate platelet activation processes leading to large aggregate formation. Therefore, we estimated the contribution of TXA2, ADP, and serotonin to the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex. In the presence of Mg2+, aspirin, and the TXA2 receptor antagonist, SQ29548, showed about 30% inhibition of activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex induced by platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen, but only minimal effects on adhesion and spreading of platelets were observed. These results suggest that generated TXA2 binds to adhered platelets and induces activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex. In the presence of Mg2+, a combination of aspirin with anti-α2β1 integrin did not show any additive inhibitory effects on the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex. Furthermore, in the absence of Mg2+, aspirin did not inhibit activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex. These results suggest that TXA2-mediated activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex may require platelet spreading. In contrast, removal of secreted ADP by the creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase system or the presence of serotonin receptor antagonist, ketanserin, did not show any significant inhibition of activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex, suggesting that ADP and serotonin do not have a significant effect on platelets already adhered to collagen. Platelets deficient in GP VI failed to aggregate and bind fibrinogen upon challenge with collagen-related peptide (CRP-X) suggesting a role of GP VI in the activation process and subsequent fibrinogen binding and aggregation. Although a reduced but significant amount of fibrinogen bound to GP VI-deficient platelets when they were challenged with fibrillar collagen (18Kehrel B. Wierwille S. Clemetson K.J. Anders O. Steiner M. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Okuma M. Barnes M.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 491-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Convulxin, a minor component of tropical rattle snake venom, has been shown to activate platelets by interacting exclusively with GP VI (49Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, in a related study, an antibody to α2β1 integrin inhibited convulxin-induced platelet aggregation by about 60%. The authors have proposed that during later stages of convulxin-induced platelet activation α2β1 integrin may be partially responsible for the expression of activated GP IIb-IIIa complex (50Jandrot-Perrus M. Lagrue A.H. Okuma M. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27035-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These observations and our own results further support the view that both GP VI and α2β1 integrin play important roles in the expression of the activated GP IIb-IIIa complex induced by platelet-collagen interactions.In summary, platelet adhesion to collagen can directly induce activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex. Fibrillar collagen induced increased expression than monomeric collagen. This activation process is mediated by both α2β1 integrin and GP VI and enhanced by TXA2. Although our static adhesion assay system was able to dissect the individual role of collagen receptors on activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex, it is imperative to elucidate their exact roles under more physiological conditions such as whole blood under flow conditions. Finally, considering the role of GP VI in adhesion-induced TXA2 generation and the activation of the GP IIb-IIIa complex, blocking collagen-GP VI interaction may prove to be an alternative therapeutic approach to the treatment of thrombotic disease. When the integrity of the vascular endothelium is disrupted, various macromolecular components of the vascular subendothelium become exposed and accessible to platelets. Although several of these components, such as laminin, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor, all provide a suitable substrate for platelet adhesion, fibrillar collagen is the most thrombogenic constituent of the vascular subendothelium since it supports not only adhesion but also causes platelet activation leading to platelet aggregation (1Baumgartner H.R."

This is the first report on the characterization of plastocyanin and the first three-dimensional protein structure from fern plant. 1,10-phenanthroline Plastocyanin is an electron transfer protein having a single copper atom at the active site. Plastocyanin functions as an electron carrier protein between the cytochromeb 6 f complex and P700+ in oxygenic photosynthesis (1Katoh S. Takamiya A.

Plastocyanin indicates intense absorption band due to the SCys → Cu(II) charge transfer at visible region and a narrow hyperfine coupling constant in the EPR spectra of the oxidized form (2Solomom E.I. Balswin M.J. Lowery M.D. Chem. Rev. 1992; 92: 521-542Crossref Scopus (903) Google Scholar). The electronic structure of plastocyanin has been reported by several groups (3Pierloot K. De Kerpel J.O.A.

The copper atom is located at the loop region of eight-stranded β-barrel structure and beneath the protein surface at a depth of 5–10 Å, with two histidines, one cysteine, and one methionine as ligand groups. Two regions on the surface of the plastocyanin molecule have been discussed as potential binding sites for electron transfer partners: an acidic patch (the “remote” site) and a hydrophobic patch (the “adjacent” site). Small inorganic complexes such as [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Co(phen)3]3+ (where phen indicates 1,10-phenanthroline)1 have been used as redox probes. A great deal of evidence from kinetics measurements suggests that the adjacent and remote sites are the sites of electron transfer to [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Co(phen)3]3+, respectively (16Sykes A.G. Struct. Bonding. 1990; 75: 175-224Crossref Google Scholar). In higher plant plastocyanins, the adjacent site consists of conserved hydrophobic amino acid residues surrounding the solvent-exposed His87, and the remote site is an acidic patch comprising Asp42, Glu43, Asp44, Glu59, Glu60, Asp61, and Glu68 as well as the invariant residue Tyr83(9Guss J.M. Harrowell P.R. Murata M. Norris V.A. Freeman H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 361-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Electron transfer reaction studies of the nitrated plastocyanin at the remote site Tyr83 indicated the possible interaction with cytochrome f at the site of Tyr83 (17Gross E.L. Curtiss A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies of pea plastocyanin has demonstrated that the solvent-exposed Tyr83 is essential for binding and electron transfer reactions (18He S. Modi S. Gray J.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). From these reaction studies and comparative investigations using the acidic patch mutants, it has been suggested that a physiological electron donor, cytochrome f, might interact with the acidic patch of plastocyanin. Qin and Kostic (19Qin L. Kostić N.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5145-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Qin L. Kostić N.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6073-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have suggested that the rearrangement of the electron transfer site between plastocyanin and cytochrome c (as a model of cytochrome f) causes the gating of the electron transfer. Very recently, computational simulation also indicates that the rearrangement is optimized through the π-cation interaction between the phenol moiety of the remote electron transfer site Tyr83 and the ε-amino group of lysine side chain of cytochrome f to the effective electron transfer interaction mode (21Crnogorac M.M.

Recent solution structure analysis of spinach plastocyanin indicates that the complex formation with cytochrome f dominantly occurs through the hydrophobic moiety of plastocyanin (24Ubbink M. Ejdebäck M. Karlsson B.G. Bendall D.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 323-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Plastocyanin is distributed among wide variety of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms involving cyanobacteria, green algae, and higher plants. The expression level of plastocyanin in a part of cyanobacteria and green algae is regulated by the levels of copper concentration in the culture medium (25Merchant S. Silver S. Walden W. Metal Ions in Gene Regulation. Chapman Hall, New York1997: 450-467Google Scholar). Although the presence of plastocyanin in species of fern has been recognized (26Boulter D. Haslett B.G. Peacock D. Ramshaw J.A.M. Scawen M.D. Northcote D.H. International Review of Biochemistry: Plant Biochemistry II. 13. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1977: 1-40Google Scholar), no plastocyanin from a fern has been characterized previously. A novel plastocyanin has now been isolated and purified from the fernDryopteris crassirhizoma. We here report the isolation, spectroscopic properties, amino acid sequence, electron transfer kinetics, and crystal structures of the oxidized (at 1.7 Å resolution) and reduced form (at 1.8 Å resolution) of a novel plastocyanin from the fern D. crassirhizoma. This is the first report on the characterization of plastocyanin from ferns and also the first three-dimensional protein structure from ferns. Leaves ofD. crassirhizoma Nakai, collected on a mountain in Nagano Prefecture, Japan, were homogenized in 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) with an automatic mortar. The homogenate was centrifuged to remove debris and subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation (0.3–1.0 saturation), ion exchange column chromatography with DEAE-cellulose and DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), hydrophobic chromatography with Butyl-Toyopearl 650 m(Tosoh), and gel filtration with Bio-Gel P-10 (Bio-Rad). Protein homogeneity was checked with analytical SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The complete amino acid sequence of Dryopteris plastocyanin was determined as described (27Yoshizaki F. Fukazawa T. Mishina Y. Sugimura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), except that carboxymethyl-plastocyanin was subjected to lysyl endopeptidase digestion (molar ratio of enzyme/substrate = 1/400, in 0.01 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, at 37 °C for 6 h) or cyanogen bromide cleavage (molar ratio of chemical/protein = 500, in 70% formic acid at room temperature for 20 h), and an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer was used. The sequences of plastocyanin and peptides isolated were confirmed by amino acid analysis. Amino acid sequence data were obtained from the data base SWISS-PROT release 36 (28Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and each sequence was aligned by using CLUSTAL X version 1.64b (29Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar). The putative processing sites are those shown in the data base or the reference cited therein. UV-visible spectra were determined on a Beckman DU-7500 recording spectrophotometer. Resonance Raman spectra were measured at room temperature with a spinning cell (1800 rpm; 5-mm diameter), and Raman shifts were calibrated to an accuracy of 1 cm−1 using indene and carbon tetrachloride. Resonance Raman scattering was excited at 607 nm by a rhodamine 6G dye laser (Spectra Physics, model 375B) pumped by an Ar+ ion laser (Spectra Physics, model 2017) and an Astromed CCD 3200 detector attached to a single monochromator (Ritsu Oyo Kogaku, DG-1000). The laser power was adjusted to 60 mW at the sampling point. All reactions were monitored on an Otsuka Electronics (Osaka, Japan) Photal RA-401 stopped flow spectrophotometer. Electron transfer reactions of plastocyanin with inorganic complexes were monitored at 590 nm at 25 °C. All kinetic parameters were calculated using the program IgorPro(WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The kinetic data were analyzed using the following equation (16Sykes A.G. Struct. Bonding. 1990; 75: 175-224Crossref Google Scholar). k=k0+kHKa[H+]1+Ka[H+]Equation 1 where the acid dissociation constant K a and the rate constants are as defined in Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4.

A single-compartment electrochemical cell was used with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Bioanalytical Systems Inc.), and a platinum wire counter electrode was separated by a vicor glass tip from the working solution. The electrode potential was calibrated with the potential of [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ couple. Oxygen was removed from the working compartment by passing humidified O2-free argon through the electrochemical cell for 15 min. The hanging drop vapor diffusion method was applied for the crystallization of plastocyanin using ammonium sulfate as the precipitant. A hanging drop comprising a 6-μl droplet of a 10 mg/ml protein solution in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and 32% saturated ammonium sulfate was suspended above 500 μl of a reservoir solution comprising the same buffer, 1 mm sodium azide and 64–65% saturated ammonium sulfate. Single crystals with maximum dimensions 0.4 × 0.4× 0.2 mm3 were obtained. All processes were carried out at 20 °C. The reduced form was prepared by soaking a crystal in the mother liquid containing 10 mm sodium ascorbate. The characteristic blue color disappeared after 10 min. Intensity data for both the oxidized and reduced forms were collected from single crystals on a Rigaku RAXIS-IIc imaging plate, using CuKα radiation from a rotating anode x-ray generator, Rigaku RU-300 with fine-focused beam and β-filtered (40 kV, 100 mA). The unit cell was determined to be hexagonal with a =b = 73.15 Å and c = 31.10 Å by autoindexing software on the RAXIS. The data were reduced in Laue group 6/m, and reflections with (I/ς) > 1 were accepted. The asymmetric unit in space group P61 includes one plastocyanin molecule (molecular mass = 10,000 dalton) with aV m value of 2.4 Å3/dalton (31Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar). From the value of V m the estimated solvent content is 49%. Intensity data sets were initially collected up to 2.0 Å resolution. A second intensity data set for reduced form was collected up to 1.8 Å resolution. Among 28,202 accepted observations up to 1.8 Å resolution, 8,478 independent reflections were obtained with an R merge of 6.1% and a completeness of 93.5%. A second set of intensity data for the oxidized form was collected at λ = 1.00Å with synchrotron radiation at the Photon Factory using Sakabe's Weisenberg camera for macromolecules (32Sakabe N. Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research. 1991; A303: 448-463Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Among 69,003 accepted observations up to 1.7 Å resolution, 10,220 independent reflections were obtained with anR merge of 8.9% and a completeness of 96%. The crystal structure of oxidized form was solved by the molecular replacement method with the program of AMoRe (33Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr.

Model rebuilding was performed with the program FRODO (35Guss J.M. Bartunik H.D. Freeman H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1992; B48: 790-811Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Refinement of the oxidized structure was carried out at 1.7 Å resolution by the simulated annealing refinement method (X-PLOR (34Brünger A.T. Kurian J. Karplus M.

The current structure of oxidized plastocyanin includes 758 protein atoms (nonhydrogen), one metal ion and 47 water molecules. After rebuilding and several cycles of refinement, the R-factor and freeR-factor are 24.1 and 28.8% for 9,943 unique reflections in the range of 6.0 to 1.7Å. The structure of reduced plastocyanin including 38 water molecules is refined up to 1.8 Å resolution with anR-factor and a free R-factor of 20.7 and 22.6%, respectively. Plastocynain from D. crassirhizoma consists of 102 amino acid residues. The complete amino acid sequence of the plastocyanin has been determined (Fig.1). The amino acid sequence of D. crassirhizoma plastocyanin is much different from those of the seed plant proteins so far reported (Fig.2). Percentage divergences between the fern sequence and each of the seed plant sequences are 62–67%; in contrast, those among the seed plant sequences are 2–37%. Because the sequence for D. crassirhizoma is identical to that for another fern, Polystichum longifrons, except for 4 amino acid residues, 2Y. Nagai and F.

The electronic absorption spectrum of Dryopteris plastocyanin has maxima at 463 nm (ε = 1000 cm−1m−1), 590 nm (ε = 4700 cm−1m−1), and 753 nm (ε = 2000 cm−1m−1), and a shoulder peak at 410 nm (ε = 900 cm−1m−1) in the visible region. The absorption band at 590 nm has been assigned to the Cys(Spπ) → Cu2+ (2Solomom E.I. Balswin M.J. Lowery M.D. Chem. Rev. 1992; 92: 521-542Crossref Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 3Pierloot K. De Kerpel J.O.A. Ryde U. Roos B.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 218-226Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In comparison with the spectra of higher plant plastocyanins, the most intense absorption band at 590 nm is shifted to a shorter wavelength by 7 nm, and the intensity of the absorption band at 463 nm is higher. This might reflect a different electronic structure of the active site. Fig. 4shows a resonance Raman spectrum of Dryopteris plastocyanin obtained by excitation at 590 nm. Resonance Raman spectra of blue copper proteins including plastocyanin excited in resonance with the SCys− → Cu2+ charge transfer band characteristically have one or two Raman bands in the 250 cm−1 region and multiple Raman bands in the 330–490 cm−1 region. The former and latter are associated with Cu-NHis and Cu-SCys moieties, respectively (36Blair D.F. Campbell G.W. Schoonover J.R. Chan S.I. Gray H.B. Malmström B.G. Pecht I. Swanson B.I.

Very recently, the lower frequency band at 267 cm−1has been assigned to the Cu-NHis in poplar plastocyanin by Dong and Spiro (38Dong S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10434-10440Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Dryopteris plastocyanin has a unique spectrum in the Cu-SCys region, with two strong peaks at 426 and 381 cm−1, and additional small peaks at 491, 447, 410, 392, 367, and 339 cm−1. According to the assignment in poplar plastocyanin (38Dong S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10434-10440Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the 426 and 381 cm−1 bands may arise from the coupling of the modes of ν(Cu-SCys), δ(CβCαN), and δ(CβCαS), and remains are also assignable to internal modes of Cys residue and/or the coupling with ν(Cu-SCys) (38Dong S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10434-10440Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). There is also an isolated Cu-NHis mode close to 262 cm−1. This might be contributed from the stretching between copper and coordinated imidazole nitrogen atom of solvent exposed His90. The overall similarity of the resonance Raman spectrum to those of blue copper proteins suggests that the coordination at the copper site ofDryopteris plastocyanin is generally similar to that in higher plant plastocyanins (38Dong S.

A great deal of evidence from kinetics measurements suggests that the adjacent and remote sites are the sites of electron transfer to [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Co(phen)3]3+, respectively (16Sykes A.G. Struct. Bonding. 1990; 75: 175-224Crossref Google Scholar). The calculated second-order rate constants (pH 7.5) for the oxidation ofDryopteris plastocyanin by [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Co(phen)3]3+ are 1.87 (± 0.02) × 105 and 1.69 (± 0.04) × 103m−1 s−1, respectively. The electron transfer rate constants for the reaction with [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Co(phen)3]3+ seem to be almost identical to the values for higher plant plastocyanins. The crystal structure ofDryopteris plastocyanin has been determined at a resolution of 1.7 Å (oxidized) and 1.8 Å (reduced). The root mean square difference between the backbone structures of poplar andDryopteris plastocyanins is 0.74 Å. The structure ofDryopteris plastocyanin demonstrates the migration of the acidic patch (but not the invariant Tyr86) toward the adjacent site (Fig. 5). The disappearance of the acidic residues from the remote site reduces the electrostatic repulsion for negatively charged [Fe(CN)6]3−, thus facilitating electron transfer to [Fe(CN)6]3− at the remote site. The electron transfer rate constants, similar to those for higher plant plastocyanins (16Sykes A.G. Struct. Bonding. 1990; 75: 175-224Crossref Google Scholar) despite the significant structural changes, support the hypothesis that the remote site including Tyr86(corresponding to Tyr83 for usual higher plants) and the adjacent site including His90 (His87 for usual higher plants) are the electron transfer site with [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Co(phen)3]3+, respectively. The kinetic results also indicate that the remote and adjacent sites inDryopteris plastocyanin are equally efficient for electron transfer, as predicted by the electronic structure analysis (3Pierloot K. De Kerpel J.O.A. Ryde U. Roos B.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 218-226Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar,40Christensen H.E.M. Conrad L.S. Mikkelsen K.V. Nielsen M.K. Ulstrup J. Inorg. Chem. 1990; 29: 2808-2816Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the rate constants for the reactions of various plastocyanins with [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Co(phen)3]3+ complexes have been reviewed (16Sykes A.G. Struct. Bonding. 1990; 75: 175-224Crossref Google Scholar). The variation with pH of the second-order rate constants (k sec) for the oxidation ofDryopteris plastocyanin by [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Co(phen)3]3+ complexes is illustrated in Fig. 6. The acid dissociation constants, pK a, associated with oxidation by [Fe(CN)6]3− and [Co(phen)3]3+ are 5.9 ± 0.1 and 6.2 ± 0.3, respectively. Studies of the electron transfer kinetics and crystal structure of plastocyanin as functions of pH have suggested that electron transfer is inhibited at low pH by the protonation of the active site His87 (16Sykes A.G. Struct. Bonding. 1990; 75: 175-224Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast,Dryopteris plastocyanin does not become redox-inactive under acidic conditions. This suggests that in Dryopterisplastocyanin the active site His90 (His87 in higher plants) does not become protonated. In the structure ofDryopteris plastocyanin, the imidazole ring of the coordinated His90 is stacked at a van der Waals' contact distance against the phenyl group of Phe12 (Fig.7). We suggest that the π-π stacking interaction stabilizes the Cu-N(His90) bond, inhibits the rotation of the His90 imidazole ring, and thus prevents the imidazole group from becoming protonated at acidic pH.Figure 7The front (A) and side (B) views of the active site represented by ball-and-stick model (47Jones T.A.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar). The aromatic rings of Phe12and His90 (His87 for poplar) are stacked with the distance of 3.5 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The structure of the reduced protein indicates only 0.15 Å root mean square deviation from the oxidized conformation. The bonding parameters for the oxidized (pH 4.5) and reduced (pH 4.5) forms strongly support the lack of protonation at the active site of Dryopterisplastocyanin in contrast to higher plant plastocyanins where significant structural changes are caused by the dissociation of His87 (His90 for Dryopteris) from the copper atom (Table I). A stacking interaction between the coordinated imidazole ligand of histamine and the phenyl group of phenylalanine was demonstrated in the previous studies of the stability and structure of copper complexes (41Yamauchi O. Odani A. Kohzuma T. Masuda H. Toriumi K. Saito K. Inorg. Chem. 1989; 28: 4066-4068Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Yamauchi and co-workers (42Sugimori T. Masuda H. Ohata N. Koiwai K. Odani A. Yamauchi O. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 36: 576-583Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar) have pointed out that the stacking interaction induces stronger imidazole-copper bonding due to the delocalization of electron density on the copper center. By the comparison of electronic absorption spectra of usual seed plant plastocyanins, the electronic absorption spectrum ofDryopteris plastocyanin indicates the 7 nm blue-shifted charge transfer band, and an additional absorption band at 410 nm is recognized in the electronic absorption spectrum (see above). The resonance Raman excitation profile of poplar plastocyanin has suggested that the charge transfer band from Hisπ1 to Cu2+ should be lying into the most intense absorption band around at 600 nm (38Dong S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10434-10440Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the charge transfer band between stacked Phe12 and His90 residues would be expected around 300–400 nm region (42Sugimori T. Masuda H. Ohata N. Koiwai K. Odani A. Yamauchi O. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 36: 576-583Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The differences of electronic absorption spectra between Dryopteris and usual higher plant plastocyanins may reflect the stacking structure on the active site electronic structures.Table IDimensions of the copper site in oxidized and reduced Dryopteris plastocyanin at pH 4.5, compared with poplar plastocyanin (9Guss J.M.

The redox potential of Dryopterisplastocyanin has been determined to be 387 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7.0. This value is approximately 20 mV higher than the values for most other plastocyanins (360–370 mVversus normal hydrogen electrode), although it was expected that a lower redox potential due to negatively charged acidic amino acid residues surrounding the hydrophobic part of Dryopterisplastocyanin would be observed as a decrease in the redox potential in the mutant plastocyanins (43Sigfridsson K. Young S. Hansson Ö. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and azurin (44Van Pouderoyen G. Mazumdar S. Hunt N.I. Hill H.A.O. Canters G.W. Eur. J.

Despite the several acidic amino acid residues located near the copper center (adjacent site) in the case of Dryopteris plastocyanin, the redox potential appears at a higher potential. The remarkable positive value of the redox potential may reflect the reduction of electron density on the copper center through the π-π stacking interaction between the coordinated imidazole ligand of His90 and the phenyl group of Phe12. The pH dependence of the reduction potential of the protein displays at least one acid-base equilibrium (data not shown). At the lower pH values the behavior is different from that observed for other plastocyanins (16Sykes A.G. Struct. Bonding. 1990; 75: 175-224Crossref Google Scholar, 45Sasakawa Y. Onodera K.

In the usual higher plant plastocyanins, the differences of redox poteintial, ΔE between pH 5 and pH 7 have been evaluated to be 50–60 mV, but the corresponding ΔE value of Dryopterisplastocyanin has been estimated to be only 18 mV. It is most likely that the independence of the redox potential on pH also reflects the stacking interaction between Phe12 and His90preventing the protonation of the active site His90. Sykes suggested that the pK a values obtained from the kinetic experiments using [Co(phen)3]3+are due to contributions arising from both the acidic patch and the active site protonation (16Sykes A.G. Struct. Bonding. 1990; 75: 175-224Crossref Google Scholar). The acid dissociation constant, pK a = 6.2 ± 0.3, obtained from the kinetic studies of Dryopteris plastocyanin would reflect the pure protonation process at the acidic patch, because the redox reaction proceeds without active site protonation. The affinity of cationic [Co(phen)3]3+ for Dryopterisplastocyanin should be decreased by the partial neutralization of the negative charge on the protein molecule, which may explain the lowering of the activity at low pH (Fig. 6). These results indicate the significance of the lack of protonation at the active site of Dryopteris plastocyanin, the equivalence of the two electron transfer sites in this protein, and a possibility of obtaining a novel insight into the photosynthetic electron transfer system of the first vascular plant fern, including its molecular evolutionary aspects.

https://openalex.org/W2139601584,"Abstract Transposon Tn5 employs a unique means of self-regulation by expressing a truncated version of the transposase enzyme that acts as an inhibitor. The inhibitor protein differs from the full-length transposase only by the absence of the first 55 N-terminal amino acid residues. It contains the catalytic active site of transposase and a C-terminal domain involved in protein-protein interactions. The three-dimensional structure of Tn5inhibitor determined to 2.9-A resolution is reported here. A portion of the protein fold of the catalytic core domain is similar to the folds of human immunodeficiency virus-1 integrase, avian sarcoma virus integrase, and bacteriophage Mu transposase. The Tn5inhibitor contains an insertion that extends the β-sheet of the catalytic core from 5 to 9 strands. All three of the conserved residues that make up the “DDE” motif of the active site are visible in the structure. An arginine residue that is strictly conserved among the IS4 family of bacterial transposases is present at the center of the active site, suggesting a catalytic motif of “DDRE.” A novel C-terminal domain forms a dimer interface across a crystallographic 2-fold axis. Although this dimer represents the structure of the inhibited complex, it provides insight into the structure of the synaptic complex."

Glutamate receptor-interacting protein has seven PDZ domains and binds α amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazaole propionic acid receptorsvia the fourth and fifth PDZ domains (23Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The ligands for other PDZ domains of glutamate receptor-interacting protein have not been so far reported. Synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM) was originally identified as a SAPAP-interacting protein (24Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We have first reported that S-SCAM has one GK, two WW, and five PDZ domains (24Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The GK domain of S-SCAM is shorter than that of PSD-95/SAP90. The WW domain is a protein-interacting module binding a proline-rich sequence (25Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The recent version of simple modular architecture research tool recognizes an additional PDZ domain at the N terminus of S-SCAM (26Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). We number these PDZ domains consecutively from 0 to 5 (PDZ0, -1, -2, -3, -4, and -5) to keep consistency with the first report. Among six PDZ domains, PDZ1 and -5 bind to the C termini of neuroligin and NMDA receptors, respectively (24Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because S-SCAM has more PDZ domains than PSD-95/SAP90, it may integrate more components of synaptic junctions. Based on this assumption, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the PDZ domains of S-SCAM to obtain a novel neuronal molecule. Eventually, this molecule binds not only to S-SCAM but also to PSD-95/SAP90. We have named this protein MAGUIN-1 (membrane-associated guanylate kinase-interacting protein-1). Rat brain yeast two-hybrid library was constructed using pVP16 vector and screened (27Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brain cDNA libraries were screened with the [α-32P]dCTP-labeled random-primed probes (27Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the products of pGex4T-1 MAGUIN-1 and pGex5X-3 MAGUIN-16. The monoclonal anti-Myc-tag antibody, 9E10, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The anti-γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor antibody was purchased from Chemicon. The anti-NMDAR1 antibody was a generous gift of Dr. Nils Brose (Max Planck Institute). The anti-S-SCAM antibody was described (24Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M.

COS cells of two 10-cm plates were homogenized in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min. The supernatant was used as a COS cell extract. 0.5-ml aliquots of the COS cell extract were incubated with 200 pmol of various GST constructs fixed on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. After the beads were washed with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, proteins on the beads were detected with the immunoblottings using the appropriate antibodies. The crude synaptosomal fraction was prepared from four rat brains as described (24Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol.

After the beads were washed four times with 50 mm NaOH/Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, proteins on the beads were detected with the immunoblottings using the appropriate antibodies. CHO cells were transfected with various eukaryote expression vectors using TransFast Transfection Reagent (Promega). After 48 h, the cells were collected and homogenized in 300 μl of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, by sonication. 80 μl of the homogenate was kept for the analysis, and the remaining samples were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min to separate the supernatant and the pellet.

Other procedures, including subcellular fractionation of rat brain, primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, immunocytostaining, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein determination, were performed as described (20Takeuchi M.

Northern and Western blottings were performed using multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. We performed the yeast two-hybrid screening using baits containing the PDZ domains of S-SCAM (pBTM116 S-SCAM-13, -14, and -16). We obtained 34 positive independent clones from 5 × 106 clones of a rat brain yeast two-hybrid library. The sequences of 22 clones were novel, and we performed Northern blot analysis for these clones. The messages of two clones (pPrey 4233 and pPrey 4514) were detected only in the brain. During the study, the sequence of human brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 was reported, and pPrey 4514 turned out to be rat brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1. We obtained the presumptive full-length coding sequences of pPrey 4233 through the conventional hybridization screening using a rat brain cDNA library and polymerase chain reaction using rat brain cDNAs as templates. Two isoforms were detected and named MAGUIN-1 and -2. MAGUIN-1 had 1032 amino acids and was composed of one sterile α motif (SAM) domain, one PDZ domain, and one plekstrin homology (PH) domain (Fig.1 A). MAGUIN-1 had Thr-His-Val at the C terminus, which corresponded to the PDZ domain-binding motif. pPrey 4233 contained the C-terminal 319 residues of MAGUIN-1 (amino acids 714–1032, underlined in Fig. 1 A). MAGUIN-2 contained the N-terminal 895 amino acids of MAGUIN-1 and is terminated with Ser as the last (896th) residue, lacking the PDZ domain-binding motif (Fig. 1 B). The SAM domain of MAGUINs is about 30% homologous to those of Caenorhabditis elegans R01H10.8 and yeast byr2 and about 15% homologous to that of yeastSTE50 (Fig. 2 A) (28Ponting C.P.

The C terminus of MAGUIN-1 interacted with S-SCAM, whereas the C terminus of MAGUIN-2 did not (Fig.3 A). MAGUIN-1 was coimmunoprecipitated with S-SCAM from the rat crude synaptosomal fraction (Fig. 3, B and C). To determine the interacting region of S-SCAM with MAGUIN-1, various Myc-tagged constructs of S-SCAM were incubated with GST-MAGUIN-12 containing the C terminus of MAGUIN-1 (Fig.4 A). Myc-S-SCAM-1, -4, -11, and -10 interacted, whereas Myc-S-SCAM-2, -3, and -9 did not (Fig.4 B), suggesting that the fourth and fifth PDZ domains were involved in the interaction. From the reverse yeast two-hybrid screening using pBTM116 MAGUIN-9 as a bait, the PDZ domains of PSD-95/SAP90, PSD93/chapsyn110, and SAP97 were obtained (36Brenman J.E. Chao D. Gee S.H. McGee A.W.

In the subcellular fractionation of rat brain, MAGUINs were detected mainly in the synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) and PSD fractions (Fig.7 A). Two bands with different molecular sizes may represent protein degradation, post-translational modifications, or alternative splicing isoforms.

To test whether MAGUINs associate with the plasma membrane through the PH domain, various Myc-tagged constructs of MAGUINs were transfected in CHO cells (Fig.8 A). Full-length MAGUIN-1 and -2 and the construct containing the PH domain with the C-terminal stretch were localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 8 B,1f, 2f, and m). The construct containing the SAM and PDZ domains was distributed in the cytosol (Fig.8 B, n). The construct containing the C-terminal region of MAGUIN-1 was localized at the plasma membrane, although it lacked the PH domain (Fig. 8 B, c). The similar results were obtained in the subcellular fractionation of CHO cells transfected with these constructs. Full-length MAGUIN-1 was recovered in the membrane fraction (Fig.9 A). The N-terminal construct containing the SAM and PDZ domains was distributed more in the cytosol than in the membrane fraction (Fig. 9 B). The PH domain with the C-terminal stretch was recovered in the membrane fraction (Fig.9 C). The C-terminal construct was recovered mainly in the membrane fraction with a smaller amount in the cytosol (Fig.9 D). Because the construct containing only the PH domain was not expressed, we could not determine whether the PH domain was directly involved in the membrane association of MAGUIN-1. However, these findings suggest that MAGUIN-1 associates with the plasma membrane through the region containing the PH domain and the C-terminal stretch of the PH domain. The N-terminal, PH domain, and C-terminal constructs were Triton X-100-soluble, whereas the full-length construct of MAGUIN-1 was Triton X-100-insoluble (Fig. 9), suggesting that the whole structure of MAGUIN-1 is necessary for the interaction with the Triton X-100-insoluble structures.Figure 9Subcellular localization of MAGUIN-1 in CHO cells.

PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM were distributed in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction in CHO cells (Fig.10, A and B). MAGUIN-1 and -2 were distributed in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig. 9 A and data not shown). PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM were recruited into the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, when coexpressed with MAGUIN-1 (Fig. 10, C and D). In contrast, PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM remained in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction, when coexpressed with MAGUIN-2 (data not shown). In this paper, we have identified a novel ligand for S-SCAM and named it MAGUIN-1. We have also reported its short isoform, MAGUIN-2. MAGUIN-1 binds to PSD-95/SAP90 as well as to S-SCAM. MAGUINs have a unique combination of protein modules including SAM, PDZ, and PH domains. SAM domain is proposed to mediate protein binding or DNA binding (reviewed in Refs. 28Ponting C.P.

The subcellular localization of MAGUINs precludes a DNA binding role, but some protein may interact with MAGUINs via the SAM domain. The PDZ domain is a well known protein module that binds to the C terminus of other proteins (reviewed in Refs. 2Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin.

The PDZ domain is composed of two α helixes and six β sheets, and the second α helix and second β sheet provide a carboxyl-binding loop (32Doyle A.D. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R.

The residues of this loop of MAGUINs are diverged from those of PSD-95/SAP90 or CASK, suggesting that the ligand for the PDZ domain of MAGUINs has the C-terminal residues different from either group 1 or group 2 consensus motif (41Songyang Z.

No interacting protein was obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening using the PDZ domain of MAGUINs as a bait (data not shown), and whether the PDZ domain of MAGUINs functions as a protein-interacting module needs to be investigated. The PH domain binds to inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides and regulates the membrane association of many signaling proteins (reviewed in Refs. 39Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar and 40Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). We could not determine whether the PH domain was required for the membrane association, but we observed that MAGUIN-1 binds to the plasma membrane through the region containing the PH domain and the C-terminal region. This finding suggests that the PH domain can support the membrane attachment, as well as the C-terminal region. The C-terminal stretch of the PH domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase is reported to bind the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (Gβγ) (43Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal stretch of the PH domain of MAGUINs is diverged from that of β-adrenergic receptor kinase, and the interaction of MAGUIN-1 with Gβγ is not detected (data not shown). However, because the C-terminal region of MAGUIN-1 also mediates the membrane association, this region also has a binding activity for lipid or some membrane protein. MAGUIN-1 is a common ligand for PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM, which are both neuronal multiple PDZ domain-containing proteins. PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM bind NMDA receptors, K+ channels, and neuroligin through distinct PDZ domains and assemble these molecules at synaptic junctions. PSD-95/SAP90 further interacts with neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, synGAP, and CRIPT (16Kim J.H. Liao D. Lau L.-F. Huganir R.L.

During this study, aDrosophila gene that genetically interacts with kinase suppressor of ras (ksr) has been reported and namedconnector enhancer of ksr (cnk) (44Therrien M. Wong A.M. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).cnk functions in the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the product of cnk physically binds Raf kinase. CNK has a molecular structure similar to that of MAGUINs. Therefore, MAGUIN-1 may also bind Raf kinase and links it to PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM. The yeast two-hybrid screening using the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 revealed SPA-1-like protein besides SAPAP and BEGAIN (22Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A.

McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). We have not confirmed the interaction of SPA-1-like protein with PSD-95/SAP90 using other methods and have not tested whether it has a GAP activity. However, these findings suggest a model that the components implicated in the Ras/MAPK pathway are assembled through the complex of PSD-95/SAP90 and MAGUIN-1. This model is interesting, because the Ras/MAPK pathway is suggested to be implicated in the synaptic plasticity (reviewed in Ref. 47Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 233-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We are now testing this model. MAGUIN-1 is Triton X-100-insoluble and recruits PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM into the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. SAPAP has a similar activity for PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM (22Deguchi M. Hata Y.

Hirao, unpublished observation. These findings suggest that PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM are connected to the Triton X-100-insoluble structures via the PDZ domain by MAGUIN-1 and via the GK domain by SAPAP. MAGUIN-2 does not bind to PSD-95/SAP90 or S-SCAM. MAGUIN-2 may compete with MAGUIN-1 for the same ligands, such as Raf kinase, and switch off these ligands from the network around PSD-95/SAP90 and S-SCAM. C. elegans R01H10.8 also has a structure similar to that of MAGUINs and may be a homologue of MAGUINs (28Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). C. eleganshas a putative S-SCAM homologue, K01A.6. Analysis of the mutants of R01H10.8 and K01A.6 may enlighten the physiological function of MAGUINs and the significance of the interaction of MAGUIN-1 with S-SCAM.

Despite several studies, the mechanism of ice binding remains unclear because of the difficulty in modeling the AFP-ice interaction. To further explore the mechanism, we have determined the x-ray crystallographic structure of 10 type III AFP mutants and combined that information with 7 previously determined structures to mainly analyze specific AFP-ice interactions such as hydrogen bonds. Quantitative assessment of binding was performed using a neural network with properties of the structure as input and predicted antifreeze activity as output. Using the cross-validation method, a correlation coefficient of 0.60 was obtained between measured and predicted activity, indicating successful learning and good predictive power. A large loss in the predictive power of the neural network occurred after properties related to the hydrophobic surface were left out, suggesting that van der Waal's interactions make a significant contribution to ice binding. By combining the analysis of the neural network with antifreeze activity and x-ray crystallographic structures of the mutants, we extend the existing ice-binding model to a two-step process: 1) probing of the surface for the correct ice-binding plane by hydrogen-bonding side chains and 2) attractive van der Waal's interactions between the other residues of the ice-binding surface and the ice, which increases the strength of the protein-ice interaction.

Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), a model was proposed whereby surface adsorption occurs through a hydrogen bond match between the side chains of Gln-9, Asn-14, Thr-15, Thr-18, Gln-44, and the ice prism plane { 101¯0}. These polar residues form part of a flat, amphipathic face that is thought to be the ice-binding surface (Fig. 1). However, the significance of the contribution from hydrogen bonds to the AFP-ice interaction has been questioned by several studies since then. A supposedly conservative change of Thr to Ser in type I AFP led to a large loss of TH activity, whereas a change to the hydrophobic residue valine, which is a better space-filling match, caused only a small loss (7Chao H.

The less favorable interaction between ice and AFP could be overcome by gain in entropy because of the release of protein-associated water into the bulk solvent. Shape complementarity was examined experimentally by mutating Ala-16, a residue that is located in the center of the putative ice-binding surface (9DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L Ye Q. Jia Z. J. Mol.

Co-expression of matched chimeras of human SUR1 and SUR2A with KIR6.2 delineates two segments of SUR within the first 5 transmembrane domains and in the C terminus that specify the pattern of spontaneous bursting and sensitivity to inhibitory ATP, respectively. This is the first identification of the molecular determinants within SUR, an ABC protein, that interact with KIR6.2 to specify the intrinsic activity and ATP sensitivity of the heteromeric channel isoforms. The results suggest that allosteric interactions play an important role in the unique ATP inhibitory gating displayed by this channel family.DISCUSSIONThis is the first identification of two segments of the sulfonylurea receptor that specify the intrinsic activity and ATP sensitivity of the inward rectifier subunit of KATPchannels. The results show that the modulation of channel kinetics and apparent sensitivity to inhibitory ATP are separable. Recent reports have focused on the behavior of the homomeric KIR6.2 channels that can be studied either by removing an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal(s) (as shown by B. Schwappach, N. Zerangue, Y. N. Jan, and L. Y. Jan (21Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Tan Y.N. Tan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)) from the C terminus of KIR6.2 (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C.

(Lond.). 1998; 510: 333-345Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the homomeric channels display the wild type unitary conductance and are weakly inhibited by ATP, they lack the hallmark properties of native, heteromeric KATP channels including a high open probability, correct bursting, high sensitivity to ATP, and responsiveness to sulfonylureas, potassium channel openers, and MgADP (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 15Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13953-13958Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The properties of the homomeric channels are unlike any known native K+ channels, indicating their physiological relevance is questionable. Co-expression of KIR6.2 with a SUR, on the other hand, generates a K+ conductance that accurately reflects those found in a variety of different tissues with the isoform or tissue-specific properties being specified by the SUR involved. This report provides evidence for allosteric interactions between KIR6.2 and two regions of SUR that are involved in two defining properties of KATP channels, their spontaneous bursting behavior and ATP sensitivity. TMDI-N contains a critical determinant of bursting behavior, whereas the last 42 amino acids of SUR specify the effect of ATP on gating. These results do not contradict previous reports that mutations in the nucleotide binding folds of SUR have negligible effects on the ATP inhibition of KATP channels; rather, together the two results indicate that whereas ATP binding and possible hydrolysis on SUR is not required for ATP inhibition, interaction of KIR6.2 with other regions of the receptor are critical for normal ATP inhibitory gating.The chimeric channel experiments provide additional insight into the mechanism of inhibition of KATP channels by ATP and imply SUR either modulates the affinity of KIR6.2 for ATP or alters a link between the nucleotide binding site and the gate. We develop the following argument using a minimal linear kinetic scheme for KATP channel gating based on a simple model introduced originally by Gillis et al. (22Gillis K.D. Gee W.M. Hammoud A. McDaniel M.L. Falke L.C. Misler S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1119-C1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).As the intraburst transitions between C1 and O, specified by τO and τCf, are the same for the two channels (Fig. 1), the higher Pomax of the SUR2A/KIR6.2 channels implies the cardiac channel will spend less time in interburst closed states that bind ATP. Therefore, the reduced apparent sensitivity of the SUR2A/KIR6.2 channels versus the SUR1/KIR6.2 channels to ATP could be attributed solely to a reduction in the fraction of time the former channel spends in interburst closed states. If this were correct, the SUR isoforms could modulate the apparent ATP sensitivity of KIR6.2 solely through their effect on the transition from the open state to long-lived closed states. Although this would be consistent with the observation that the TMDI-N segment is a critical determinant of bursting behavior, it cannot explain the observation that SUR can modulate the two properties independently with the C terminus of SUR, determining the apparent ATP sensitivity of the chimeric channels without substantially altering their bursting. This argument is consistent with the observation that homomeric KIR6.2ΔC channels have a reduced sensitivity to ATP (14Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar,15Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13953-13958Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), yet spend a greatly increased fraction of time in interburst closed states proposed to bind ATP (13Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G.

Thus the differences in ATP sensitivity of the KATP channel isoforms that are attributable to SUR and the enhancement of ATP sensitivity seen when KIR6.2 is co-expressed with a SUR cannot be due solely to changes in channel kinetics that affect the occupancy of interburst closed states that bind ATP, as has been suggested from studies on several KIR6.2 mutations (15Drain P.

These results imply that SUR must either directly modulate the affinity of KIR6.2 for ATP in closed state or affect the linkage between the binding site(s) and the gate. We hypothesize that modulation of the affinity of KIR6.2 for ATP by SUR could result either from allosteric interactions or by formation of a shared ATP binding site. Further studies including direct measurement of ATP binding are needed to resolve these possibilities. KATP channels are heteromultimers of a sulfonylurea receptor, SUR,1 a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, and a potassium inward rectifier, KIR6.2 (1Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. Curr.

Physiol. 1984; 401: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A minimal description of the gating kinetics in the absence of nucleotides requires time constants, τO and τCf, which specify the distributions of open and intraburst closed states and are dependent on the K+ driving force and at least one additional time constant, τCs to describe interburst closures (6Trube G.

Although the structure, numbers of binding site(s) for inhibitory ATP, and ATP-bound closed states have not been determined, ATP shortens the mean burst duration and reduces the open channel probability (Po) mainly by increasing the fraction of time the channel spends in long interburst intervals but does not block the open channel pore, alter the unitary conductance, or have significant effects on the intraburst kinetics (reviewed, for example in Ref. 8Takano M.

Cells expressing GRP-R or NMB-R catalyzed the activation of squid retinal Gαq and mouse Gαq but not bovine retinal Gαt or bovine brain Gαi/o. The GRP-R- and NMB-R-catalyzed activations of Gαq were dependent upon and enhanced by different βγ dimers in the same rank order as follows: bovine brain βγ > β1γ2 ≫ β1γ1. Despite these qualitative similarities, GRP-R and NMB-R had distinct kinetic properties in receptor-G protein coupling. GRP-R had higher affinities for bovine brain βγ, β1γ1, and β1γ2 and squid retinal Gαq. In addition, GRP-R showed higher catalytic activity on squid Gαq. Like GRP-R and NMB-R, BRS-3 did not catalyze GTPγS binding to Gαi/o or Gαt. However, BRS-3 showed little, if any, coupling with squid Gαq but clearly activated mouse Gαq. GRP-R and NMB-R catalyzed GTPγS binding to both squid and mouse Gαq, with GRP-R activating squid Gαq more effectively, and NMB-R also showed slight preference for squid Gαq. These studies reveal that the structurally similar bombesin receptor subtypes, in particular BRS-3, possess distinct coupling preferences among members of the Gαq family.

They regulate various physiological processes such as secretion, growth, muscle contraction, and neuromodulation through high affinity receptors (1Lebacq-Verheyden A.-M. Trepel J. Sausville E.A. Battey J.F. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1990; 95: 71-124Crossref Google Scholar, 2Kroog G. Jensen R. Battey J. Med. Res. Rev. 1995; 15: 389-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Three pharmacologically and structurally distinct bombesin receptor subtypes have been cloned and characterized in mammals as follows: the GRP-preferring receptor (GRP-R), the neuromedin B-preferring receptor (NMB-R), and bombesin receptor subtype 3 (BRS-3) which has a structure related to GRP-R and NMB-R but for which no high affinity, naturally occurring ligand has been identified as yet (2Kroog G. Jensen R. Battey J. Med. Res. Rev. 1995; 15: 389-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences (2Kroog G. Jensen R. Battey J. Med. Res. Rev. 1995; 15: 389-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) of the bombesin receptor subtypes shows all three to be structurally related members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily with pairwise sequence identity ranging from 48 to 54% (see Fig. 1). Upon agonist binding, G protein-coupled receptors activate specific heterotrimeric G proteins, which in turn regulate a variety of intracellular effectors such as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, ion channels, and cGMP-phosphodiesterase (3Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4669) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of three polypeptides as follows: an α subunit and a βγ dimer that acts as a functional monomer. Ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to the Gα subunit, resulting in dissociation of the GTP-activated α subunit from both its cognate Gβγ dimer and the receptor. The GTP-activated α subunit as well as dissociated Gβγ dimer in turn regulate intracellular effectors. At least 20 different α subunits, 5 β subunits, and 12 γ subunits have been identified to date. The Gα subunits have been divided into four groups based upon sequence homology and intracellular effector regulation (4Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N.

The Gαq subfamily, which includes Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, and Gα15/16, stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis by activating phospholipase C-β (6Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev.

In addition, Gβγ subunits can also stimulate phospholipase C-βs in concert with Gαq (11Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Lee K.-H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that the seven transmembrane domain receptor superfamily consists of thousands of distinct receptors, and the family of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in receptor coupling is also very diverse, a central issue in receptor signaling is how these protein families contribute to the diversity of receptor/G protein-mediated responses while conserving the specificity of each response. One level of specificity is likely to be determined by the thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions between subunits of the heterotrimeric G protein and the receptor. Anin situ reconstitution procedure has been used successfully to study receptor-G protein interactions for baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell membranes expressing the 5-HT2c receptor (13Hartman IV, J.L. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22591-22597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and for mouse fibroblast cell membranes expressing stably transfected GRP-R (14Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This technique utilizes chaotrope-extracted membrane fractions in which endogenous GTP-binding proteins as well as other extrinsic membrane proteins are removed or inactivated by urea, while leaving uncoupled receptors fully functional when reconstituted with agonist and purified G protein subunits. Since mammalian bombesin receptors stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis (15Brown K.D. Blay J. Irvine R.F. Heslop J.P. Berridge M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Benya R. Kusui T. Pradham T. Battey J. Jensen R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 10-20PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ryan R.R. Weber H.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13613-13624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it has been assumed that agonist stimulation of bombesin receptors leads to activation of a Gαq, which in turn activates a phospholipase C-β isozyme. Antisense oligonucleotide injection of Xenopus oocytes (18Shapira H. Way J.M. Lipinsky D. Oron Y. Battey J.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) has identified Gαq as a mediator of the NMB-R response. However, inXenopus oocytes neither Gαq nor Gα11 antisense injection had any effect on GRP-R signal transduction, although the in situ reconstitution of GRP-R with purified G protein subunits shows explicitly that GRP-R activates a Gαq but not Gαi/o or Gαt(14Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Such observations raise a possibility that the ambiguity in the antisense oligonucleotide experiments could be due to a difference in the relative affinity or activity of GRP-R for Gαq as compared with that of NMB-R for Gαq. The assessment of this possibility requires a quantitative comparison of GRP-R and NMB-R coupling with purified G protein subunits in vitro. In this report we compare the receptor-G protein interactions within the structurally related bombesin receptor family using thein situ reconstitution assay. We have quantitatively examined the G protein activation by these related receptor structures using homogeneous preparations of defined G protein subunits. Our studies revealed that whereas GRP-R and NMB-R selectively coupled with squid and mouse Gαq in an agonist- and Gβγ-dependent manner, their coupling properties were distinct. GRP-R had higher affinities for Gαq and Gβγ dimers, higher catalytic activity for nucleotide exchange on Gαq, and a higher ratio of agonist stimulated to basal activity than NMB-R. On the other hand, the structurally related BRS-3 was different from GRP-R and NMB-R in selectivity for Gαq. It strongly preferred mouse Gαq over squid Gαq in the in situ reconstitution assay, whereas GRP-R clearly preferred squid Gαq, and NMB-R also showed a slight preference for squid Gαq. Membranes were prepared from Balb 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells expressing mouse GRP-R (19Kroog G.S. Sainz E. Worland P.J. Akeson M.A. Benya R.V. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol.

Receptor-enriched membranes were obtained as a P2 fraction from these cells as described previously (14Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding the open reading frame of the human BRS-3 (hBRS-3) flanked by FLAG epitope tag at the 5′ end was cloned intoEcoRI site of a transfer vector pBacPAK8 (CLONTECH). The sequence at the 5′ end is 5′-AATTCGGCTTGCGCGCATGGACTACAGGACGACGATGACAAGGCTCAAAGGCAG-3′.

Insect cell culture, transfection, plaque purification, and virus amplification of BRS-3 were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). We modified our previously published urea extraction procedure (13Hartman IV, J.L. Northup J.K. J. Biol.

The P2 membrane pellet was resuspended in ice-cold solution A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride HCl) containing 7 m urea. After incubation in 7 murea for 30 min on ice, the membrane solution was diluted to less than 4 m urea with solution A and then sedimented at 142,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Following a single urea extraction and centrifugation, the membrane pellet was washed once with solution A alone and recollected by sedimentation as before. The final pellet was resuspended in solution A with 12% (w/v) sucrose, and aliquots were frozen and stored at −80 °C. Receptor ligand-binding sites were determined as described by Hellmich et al. (14Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

Unextracted GRP-R, NMB-R, BRS-3, and 4ΔBRS-3 were also assayed for ligand-binding sites with the radiolabeled agonist 125I-labeled [d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6–14) (125I-Tyr-697 (25Mantey S.A.

The receptor abundance of BRS-3 expressed in Sf9 cells was also estimated by Western blot using FLAG-BAP as protein standard and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Company) to detect FLAG fusion protein.

Bovine brain βγ preparations were further purified by additional chromatography over phenyl-Sepharose to remove GTPγS binding activity (13Hartman IV, J.L. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22591-22597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The receptor-catalyzed GDP/GTPγS exchange on Gα was determined essentially as described previously (32Fawzi A.B. Fay D.S. Murphy E.A. Tamir H. Erdos J.J. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12194-12200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the addition of 2 μm GDP to compete for uncatalyzed GTPγS binding (14Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Receptor-containing membranes were mixed with G protein subunits and with or without agonist on ice in a total volume of 30 μl. An addition of 20 μl of reaction solution was used to initiate the reactions. The reactions contained a final concentration of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mmMgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μm GDP, and [35S]GTPγS (about 4–8 nm). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 or 15 min, terminated by adding 2 ml of ice-cold solution B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl), and filtered over nitrocellulose membranes on a vacuum manifold. The filters were washed four times with 2 ml each of ice-cold solution B and dried, and the bound radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. Urea-extracted cell membranes containing different heptahelical receptors have been successfully reconstituted with purified G protein subunits. These receptor membranes include rod outer segment disc membranes of bovine retina (29Fawzi A.B. Northup J.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell membranes containing the 5-HT2c receptor (13Hartman IV, J.L. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22591-22597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and stably transfected fibroblast cell membranes containing GRP-R (14Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We applied this in situ receptor reconstitution technique to the bombesin receptor family to compare the G protein coupling properties of bombesin receptor subtypes, which share 48 to 54% amino acid homology (Fig. 1). We modified the previously published urea extraction procedure to obtain more consistent receptor recovery and G protein depletion (see “Experimental Procedures”). Table Isummarizes the effects of the modified procedure on receptor-binding sites and GTPγS binding activity of GRP-R- and NMB-R-containing membranes. Compared with the 6 m urea extraction procedure used previously, 7 m urea required only one instead of two or three extractions, removed more endogenous GTPγS binding activity (94–96% versus 92%), while consistently maintaining high recovery of ligand-binding sites. The GRP-R-binding site abundance was actually enriched more than 3-fold by 7 m urea extraction, since 100% of the antagonist binding activity was recovered, whereas 71% of the membrane protein was removed. Furthermore, for both GRP-R and NMB-R, agonist-stimulated GTPγS binding in the absence of exogenous G proteins was also abolished more thoroughly by 7m urea extraction than by 6 m urea extraction used previously (data not shown), suggesting 7 m urea treatment resulted in a more homogeneous population of uncoupled receptors.Table IEffects of 7 m urea extraction on ligand-binding sites and endogenous GTPγS binding activity of the GRP-R and NMB-R membranesReceptorAssayPre-7 m urea extractionPost-7m urea extractionRecoveryfmol%GRP-R125I-697 (agonist)-binding sites13.1 ± 2.9NDaND, not determined.

Table I also shows that 125I-697 (universal bombesin receptor agonist) and 125I-ME (GRP-R-specific antagonist) measured identical binding site abundance on membranes before urea extraction, indicating that we could use 125I-697 to determine the receptor concentration for NMB-R and BRS-3, for which a radiolabeled high affinity antagonist is not available. Because of the decreased affinities of uncoupled receptors for agonists,125I-697-binding sites of 7 m urea-extracted GRP-R, NMB-R, and BRS-3 could not be determined accurately. Since 7 m urea extraction removed more endogenous GTPγS binding from GRP-R-containing membranes, we tested whether these uncoupled receptors could couple with purified squid retinal Gαq and bovine brain Gβγ as was shown previously for 6 m urea-treated GRP-R (14Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the results for reconstitution of membranes containing GRP-R and NMB-R either untreated or 7m urea-extracted. To facilitate the comparison of the efficiency of reconstitution, we have tested approximately equal catalytic activities of the two receptor types at K mconcentrations of αq and near-saturating βγ. Thus we are directly comparing both the success of reconstitution and the catalytic properties of the receptors. These experiments demonstrated that (i) very little agonist-stimulated exchange of GDP for GTPγS on exogenously added Gαq was detected for unextracted GRP-R or NMB-R (Fig. 2, A and C); (ii) both 7 m urea-extracted GRP-R and 7 murea-extracted NMB-R coupled with squid Gαq (Fig. 2,B and D); (iii) like GRP-R, NMB-R-catalyzed activation of Gαq was also dependent on both agonist and βγ subunits (Fig. 2, B and D). Despite the qualitative similarities between GRP-R and NMB-R in G protein coupling, they were clearly different in the ratio of agonist-independent (basal) to agonist-stimulated activity (Fig. 2, B andD). In order to obtain initial rate estimates for the receptor-catalyzed GTPγS binding, we performed the progress analyses for GRP-R- and NMB-R-catalyzed reactions shown in Fig.3. For both 7 murea-extracted GRP-R and NMB-R and G protein alone, the binding of GTPγS progressed at a very low rate; G protein-reconstituted receptors without agonist showed an increased rate of binding, whereas the addition of agonist increased the reaction rate to the highest values. Moreover, for all of these conditions the GTPγS binding was approximately linear with time for the initial 10 min of the reaction. Therefore we have used 10 min as a fixed time point in the GDP/GTPγS exchange assay to measure the initial velocity of the receptor-catalyzed activation in all subsequent experiments. The greatly accelerated initial rates of GTPγS binding in the presence of agonist represent our measure of receptor-catalyzed G protein activation. The GRP-R, NMB-R, and BRS-3 were expressed at widely varying abundance in the Balb 3T3 fibroblasts. Therefore, we have used the modified GTPγS binding procedures (14Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F.

A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) including trace [35S]GTPγS and 2 μm GDP to suppress residual nucleotide binding activity of the urea-extracted membranes rather than our initial procedures that utilize 1 μmGTPγS with no competing nucleotide (13Hartman IV, J.L. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22591-22597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our modified procedure also accommodates the comparison of the family of Gα proteins that differ in spontaneous binding exchange rates. Because the chemical concentration of GTPγS (4–8 nm) limits the binding reactions, the plateau values obtained in these experiments are not stoichiometric binding of GTPγS to the Gαq. Rather, they represent consumption of the [35S]GTPγS trace in the binding reactions. That these receptors are indeed catalytic was demonstrated by additional experiments using 1 μm GTPγS without competing GDP in which 1 nm GRP-R or NMB-R activated the entire 100 nm Gαq in about 40 min (data not shown). Our previous study has shown selective coupling of GRP-R with Gαq but not Gαi/o or Gαt(14Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In order to know whether the other members of the bombesin receptor family share the same selectivity for Gαq, we tested the ability of urea-extracted membranes to catalyze exchange of GDP for GTPγS on squid retinal Gαq, bovine retinal Gαt, or bovine brain Gαi/o in the presence of bovine brain Gβγ. Both GRP-R (Fig.4 A) and NMB-R (Fig.4 B) selectively catalyze the exchange reaction on squid Gαq in an agonist-dependent manner. However, BRS-3 did not activate any of these G protein preparations using the universal bombesin receptor agonist 697 (Fig. 4 C). In order to understand why BRS-3 failed to catalyze nucleotide exchange on all tested G proteins, we have attempted to exclude the possibility that peptide 697 is only a partial agonist of the BRS-3. We tested a mutated BRS-3 receptor in which four amino acid residues critical for ligand selectivity were replaced with their counterparts in NMB-R and GRP-R (R127Q, S205P, H294R, and S315A, see Fig. 1). This mutant, 4ΔBRS-3, displays 2 and 3 orders of magnitude increase in affinities for GRP (21Akeson M. Sainz E. Mantey S.A. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17405-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and NMB (33Sainz E. Akeson M. Mantey S.A. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15927-15932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), respectively. Fibroblast cells expressing 4ΔBRS-3 show NMB-stimulated inositol phosphate increases (33Sainz E. Akeson M. Mantey S.A. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15927-15932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 D, 4ΔBRS-3 did not catalyze GTPγS binding on any of the tested Gα subunits in the presence of NMB. The enhanced GTPγS binding on Gαi/o in the presence of all of the bombesin receptors seems to reflect a nonspecific interaction independent of receptors, because the level of GTPγS binding was proportional to total membrane protein concentration instead of receptor concentration (data not shown). The lack of coupling of BRS-3 and 4ΔBRS-3 with the G protein subunits tested could be due to the low receptor abundance in Balb 3T3 fibroblast cells (0.26 and 0.33 pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein for BRS-3 and 4ΔBRS-3, respectively, versus 3.7 and 2.2 pmol/mg for GRP-R and NMB-R) or the absence of essential G protein subunits. To achieve high receptor abundance, Sf9 cells were used to express recombinant BRS-3 encoded by a baculovirus. To test the possibility that BRS-3 can couple with a mammalian Gαqrather than squid Gαq, recombinant mouse Gαq was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and used in the reconstitution assays. GRP-R expressed in Sf9 cells was also compared with that expressed in fibroblast cells in order to establish that the receptors expressed in these different cells have the same coupling properties. As shown in Fig.5, GRP-R expressed in mouse fibroblast cells and insect Sf9 cells behaved the same way. They activated both mouse Gαq and squid Gαq but with higher catalytic activity for the latter. Although BRS-3 expressed in fibroblast cells failed to show agonist-stimulated activity with either Gαq (most likely due to the low receptor abundance), Sf9 cell-expressed BRS-3 clearly showed coupling with mouse Gαq, but little if any coupling with squid Gαq. Another member of the bombesin receptor family, NMB-R, falls in between GRP-R and BRS-3 in selectivity for mouse and squid Gαq. NMB-R showed slightly more efficient coupling with squid Gαq than with mouse Gαq. One of the unique advantages of this in situ reconstitution technique is that it allows a quantitative assessment of receptor-G protein coupling. To determine how well a receptor couples with a G protein as well as to compare coupling efficiency between different receptors, we have performed saturation analysis of the receptor-catalyzed GTPγS exchange with the G protein subunits. Fig.6 A shows the saturation of the exchange reaction catalyzed by GRP-R and NMB-R with squid Gαq. The initial velocities conformed to a single-site model with K m values of 58 nm for GRP-R and 112 nm for NMB-R. The catalytic activities of GRP-R and NMB-R were also different, withV max 2These values almost certainly underestimate the catalytic constants of GRP-R and NMB-R for G protein activation. Our GTPγS binding reactions included 2 μm GDP to suppress the receptor-independent binding to Gα. Since the reactions included carrier-free [35S]GTPγS at 4–8 nm, the rates for GTPγS binding in the absence of competing GDP would be much higher. values of 8.5 × 10−3mGTPγS boundmreceptor−1s−1 for GRP-R and 4.1 × 10−3mGTPγS boundmreceptor−1s−1 for NMB-R. Fig. 6 B shows the saturation of the catalysis with bovine brain Gβγ. These data also fit well to a single-site model with a K 1/2 of 115 nm for GRP-R and 238 nm for NMB-R. The differences between GRP-R and NMB-R in affinity and catalytic activity for G protein subunits were statistically significant, as summarized in Table II.Table IISummary of GRP-R and NMB-R affinity and catalytic activity for squid retinal Gαq and different Gβγ dimersKinetic parametersGRP-RNMB-RK m for squid retinal Gαq(nm)66 ± 9aAll values are the means ± S.D. of values obtained from the indicated number of experiments.,bSignificantly smaller (p < 0.05) than NMB-R., n = 3120 ± 18, n = 3V max (10−3mGTPγS boundmreceptor−1s−1)8.4 ± 0.7cSignificantly greater (p < 0.05) than NMB-R., n = 34.3 ± 0.4, n = 3K 1/2 for bovine brain Gβγ (nm)93 ± 15dSignificantly smaller (p < 0.01) than NMB-R., n = 5224 ± 20, n = 6K 1/2 for Gβ1γ2 (nm)147 ± 13dSignificantly smaller (p < 0.01) than NMB-R., n = 3691 ± 33, n = 4K 1/2 for Gβ1γ1 (nm)1163 ± 176dSignificantly smaller (p < 0.01) than NMB-R., n = 63203 ± 121, n = 4a All values are the means ± S.D. of values obtained from the indicated number of experiments.b Significantly smaller (p < 0.05) than NMB-R.c Significantly greater (p < 0.05) than NMB-R.d Significantly smaller (p < 0.01) than NMB-R. Open table in a new tab Given the diversity of Gβγ dimers, the receptor-G protein coupling selectivity is unlikely to be restricted to the Gα subunit alone. To address the question of whether the bombesin receptors also have selectivity for βγ dimers, we tested the ability of GRP-R (Fig.7 A) and NMB-R (Fig.7 B) to activate Gαq with different βγ dimers, including bovine brain βγ, bovine retinal βγ (β1γ1), and β1γ2. When tested at a concentration of 0.25 μm, bovine brain βγ showed the greatest enhancement of GRP-R- or NMB-R-catalyzed exchange reaction, β1γ2 the second highest, whereas β1γ1 hardly affected the binding of GTPγS to Gαq. At a concentration of 1 μm, β1γ1 also enhanced the receptor-catalyzed GTPγS binding but incompletely, whereas 0.74 μm of β1γ2 produced the greatest enhancement. To compare the affinities of GRP-R and NMB-R for Gβγ dimers, we performed saturation analysis of the receptor-catalyzed GTPγS binding with Gβ1γ1 and Gβ1γ2. As shown in Fig.8 and summarized in Table II, GRP-R consistently showed higher affinity for the Gβγ dimers that we tested. For a given Gβγ preparation, the ratio ofK 1/2 of NMB-R and GRP-R ranged from 2.4- to 4.7-fold. Despite the quantitative differences between GRP-R and NMB-R, they showed same rank order of preference among the three βγ preparations: bovine brain βγ > β1γ2≫ β1γ1. In this study we adapted a published in situ receptor reconstitution method utilizing membranes from cells expressing recombinant GRP-R, NMB-R, BRS-3, or 4ΔBRS-3 which have been extracted with 7 m urea to remove endogenous GTP-binding proteins. The urea extraction procedure yielded a homogenous population of uncoupled receptors with 100% recovery of receptor ligand-binding sites. Such receptor preparations were functional when reconstituted with heterotrimeric G protein subunits as shown by the assay measuring the first biochemical event in G protein activation: receptor-catalyzed exchange of GTP for GDP on a Gα subunit. The in situreceptor reconstitution technique has been used successfully in our earlier studies using membranes from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells expressing 5-HT2c receptor (13Hartman IV, J.L. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22591-22597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), membranes from stably transfected fibroblast cells expressing GRP-R (14Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and now NMB-R and BRS-3. We believe that this method should be applicable to study virtually any receptor-G protein coupling. The major limitation we have observed is the receptor abundance in the membrane fraction. We found all three bombesin receptors selectively coupled with a Gαq but not Gαi/o or Gαt. However, three similar receptors were different in coupling selectivity toward members of the Gαq family. Although GRP-R and NMB-R coupled to both squid and mouse Gαq, GRP-R had a much stronger preference for squid Gαq, and NMB-R showed only a slight preference for squid Gαq. In contrast to GRP-R and NMB-R, the structurally related BRS-3 did not couple with squid Gαq, whereas it clearly coupled with mouse Gαq. Given that the differences between squid Gαq and mouse Gαq structures are not much greater than the ones among mouse Gαq subtypes themselves (34Ryba N.J. Findlay J.B. Reid J.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 36Wilkie T.M. Scherle P.A. Strathmann M.P. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10049-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to investigate coupling of the bombesin receptors to various Gαq family subtypes within the same species in future studies. The kinetic analysis of receptor-G protein interactions presented in this report also revealed a quantitative difference between GRP-R and NMB-R. The controlled, independent manipulation of receptor and G protein subunit concentrations required for this analysis is not possible using a whole cell system or prior reconstitution methods using purified, detergent-solubilized receptors and G proteins in phospholipid vesicles. GRP-R and NMB-R, although similar in their selectivity for Gαq and rank-order preference for Gβγ in the receptor-G protein coupling, were different in the catalytic activity toward Gαq and affinities for G proteins. GRP-R showed higher catalytic activity on squid Gαq and higher affinities for both Gαq and Gβγ dimers than NMB-R. These results may partially explain an ambiguity noted in antisense oligonucleotide experiments in which individual Gα subunits were depleted (18Shapira H. Way J.M. Lipinsky D. Oron Y. Battey J.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In those experiments, Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing either GRP-R or NMB-R were microinjected with antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides complementary to specific regions of either Xenopus Gαq or Gα11 to deplete selectively Gαq or Gα11 protein. Following application of agonist, the activity of the calcium-activated chloride channel was measured under whole cell voltage clamp conditions. These experiments showed that treatment with the Gαq antisense oligonucleotides could inhibit up to 74% of the response of the NMB-R but had no effect on the GRP-R response. Gα11 antisense, on the other hand, had little effect on either GRP-R- or NMB-R-mediated responses. The data reported here showed GRP-R coupled more effectively with squid Gαq than with mouse Gαq. Squid Gαq is 74–78% identical to mouse Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14. As the sequence identity between mouse Gα14 and Gαq or Gα11 is 80 or 81%, respectively, it is likely that GRP-R couples primarily with Gα14 instead of Gαq or Gα11. It is also possible that due to the higher affinity as well as higher catalytic activity for Gαq, it would be easier to observe the influence of Gαq depletion on NMB-R-regulated response than on GRP-R response. In those experiments, the antisense depletion taking place might simply fail to reduce Gαq to a level that would impair GRP-R response. GRP-R and NMB-R not only showed selective coupling with Gαq but also showed a clear discrimination between different βγ dimers. We provide two arguments that this result suggests the different βγ dimers have different affinity and/or efficacy for bombesin receptors, rather than reflecting different affinities of Gαq for βγ dimers. First, instead of a uniform difference between Gβγ dimers, GRP-R and NMB-R had different K 1/2 ratio for β1γ1 and β1γ2(8-fold versus 4.6-fold). Second, rat 5-HT2creceptor has also been shown to couple with squid retinal Gαq in the in situ reconstitution assay (13Hartman IV, J.L. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22591-22597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). But unlike GRP-R or NMB-R, it has low affinity for both bovine brain βγ (estimated K 1/2 is about 600 nm) and bovine retinal βγ, i.e.β1γ1 (13Hartman IV, J.L. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22591-22597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Other receptor-G protein coupling studies also supported the notion that receptors can have different affinities for βγ dimers. Studies of bovine rhodopsin activation of αt have found differences in apparent affinity among tissue-derived βγ dimers of defined compositions or recombinant βγ dimers, whereas αt shows essentially no preference for βγ dimers (31Wildman D.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20512-20519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that both GRP-R and NMB-R preferred bovine brain βγ over β1γ2 and the diverse composition of bovine brain βγ dimers (37Asano T. Morishita R. Matsuda T. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20512-20519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tamir H. Fawzi A.B. Tamir A. Evans T. Northup J.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3929-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggest there may be other βγ dimer(s) having higher affinity or/and efficacy than β1γ2 in enhancing the catalytic activity of GRP-R and NMB-R on Gαq. In situ receptor reconstitution has been proven to be a useful methodology for detailed kinetic analysis of receptor-G protein coupling. It allows the identity and concentration of each coupling component to be defined and manipulated, while preserving the receptors in their native phospholipid environment. By using this method, we established a significant quantitative difference between GRP-R and NMB-R for interaction with the same squid Gαq and Gβγ proteins and, in addition, a qualitative difference between those two receptors and BRS-3 which did not interact with that same Gαq. Combining the currently available high expression systems (e.g. baculovirus infection of insect Sf9 cells, transfection of mouse fibroblast cells) with the in situ receptor reconstitution technique, it should be feasible to study functional coupling between any recombinant receptor and G protein subunits, advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the signal transduction pathway for G protein-coupled receptors."

Although the modification is often essential for the proper functioning of the modified protein, the mechanism by which the modification exerts its effects is still largely unknown.

Synthetic peptides based on the N-terminal sequence showed similar binding properties to calmodulin, only when they were myristoylated. The calmodulin-binding site narrowed down to the myristoyl moiety together with a nine-amino acid N-terminal basic domain. Phosphorylation of a single serine residue in the N-terminal domain (Ser5) by protein kinase C abolished the binding.

A. 1982; 79: 6128-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), various proteins in the signal transduction pathways as well as those of viral origin have been shown to be fatty-acylated (2Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The modification is often essential for the proper functioning of the modified protein; the transforming activity of p60 src from Rous sarcoma virus, for example, is dependent on its myristoylation (3Garber E.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the modification exerts its effects is still largely unknown (2Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 4Resh M.D. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that the hydrophobic acyl groups such as myristoyl and palmitoyl groups are often involved in the protein-membrane interactions. Due to its intermediate hydrophobicity, myristoylation has been implied in the reversible membrane association (5Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Studies from our own and other laboratories have established that such a mechanism, in fact, is operative in the phosphorylation-dependent interaction of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS)1 with membranes (7Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Kim J. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 227-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the case of recoverin, the binding of Ca2+induces a drastic conformational change of the protein, and the myristoyl group hidden inside the protein will protrude from the protein and can interact with membranes (9Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, not all the myristoylated proteins are associated with membranes. The first protein that has been found myristoylated, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, is not a membrane protein. In the case of calcineurin, the second protein found myristoylated, the myristoylation seems to not affect the association of the protein with membranes, and both myristoylated and non-myristoylated proteins are found in membrane and soluble fractions (10Kennedy M.T. Brockman H. Rusnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26517-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Zhu D. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24831-24838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the modification has been shown to affect the protein stability of both proteins (10Kennedy M.T. Brockman H. Rusnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26517-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2348-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the myristoyl moiety interacts with the protein part in a manner analogous to that found in recoverin. The third possible function of the protein myristoylation, namely the involvement of the modification in protein-protein interaction, has been the subject of various studies (10Kennedy M.T. Brockman H. Rusnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26517-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Chow M. Newman J.F. Filman D. Hogle J.M. Rowlands D.J. Brown F.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, however, the last possibility has never been clearly demonstrated. Brain-specific protein CAP-23/NAP-22 has been characterized first in chicken brain as a cortical cytoskeleton-associated protein of 23 kDa (16Widmer F. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3035-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and its rat homologue was later characterized as a neuron-specific acidic protein of 22 kDa (17Maekawa S. Maekawa M. Hattori S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is related to another neuron-specific acidic protein called GAP-43, a major neuronal growth cone-associated protein (16Widmer F. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3035-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Maekawa S. Maekawa M. Hattori S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of the protein has yet to be determined, the involvement in the synaptogenesis and neuronal plasticity has been suggested (18Caroni P. Aigner L. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Like the two related proteins, GAP-43 and MARCKS (19Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CAP-23/NAP-22 is a prominent substrate of protein kinase C (PKC), and the phosphorylation by PKC is regulated by the binding to calmodulin (20Maekawa S. Murofushi H. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19462-19465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike GAP-43 and MARCKS, which have a typical calmodulin-binding domain of basic amphiphilic nature, CAP-23/NAP-22 lacks any canonical calmodulin-binding domain (20Maekawa S. Murofushi H. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19462-19465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we show that NAP-22/CAP-23 isolated from rat brain is myristoylated and that the modification is directly involved in its interaction with calmodulin. The calmodulin-binding site of the protein was narrowed down to the myristoyl moiety together with a nine-amino acid N-terminal basic domain. The acyl chain seems to interact with the hydrophobic pocket of calmodulin, which is usually occupied by the hydrophobic amino acids of target proteins. Phosphorylation of CAP-23/NAP-22 by PKC was also found to be myristoylation-dependent. The complete gene of 683 base pairs including tag regions for NcoI andXhoI restriction sites at both ends was synthesized based on the rat cDNA sequence (17Maekawa S. Maekawa M. Hattori S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that Ser3 in the deduced sequence was replaced with a Gly and that nucleotide sequence was rewritten using the bacterial codon usage. The double-stranded DNA was divided into 12 regions that overlap each other, and the DNA fragments that extended from 18 to 60 nucleotides were synthesized. They were annealed, ligated, and used as template for PCR. The synthetic gene thus obtained was incorporated between theNcoI-XhoI sites of pET14b expression vector. This approach allowed a high expression of the protein in Escherichia coli (86 mg/liter of culture medium). For the myristoylated protein, a pBB131 vector containing yeastN-myristoyltransferase cDNA was co-transformed (21Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Both proteins were purified from the heat-stable protein fractions by successive column chromatography on Phenyl-Sepharose and Resource RPC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peptides synthesized by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) were myristoylated by recombinant yeast N-myristoyltransferase in vitroas described (22Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Bryant M.L. Gordon J.I. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 405-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The myristoylated peptides were purified over a reversed-phase column (Vydac 218TP, 2.1 × 150 mm) using a linear gradient of H2O-acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins were phosphorylated by PKC purified from bovine brain as has been described previously (23Manenti S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22310-22315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated peptides were purified by reversed-phase column chromatography. For the mass spectrometric studies, the phosphorylation reaction mixtures were directly analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (24Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAP-23/NAP-22 protein purified from rat brain (24Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with lysyl endoprotease, and the resulting peptide mixture was directly injected into a liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry apparatus as described previously (24Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the sequencing of the N-terminal peptide, fractions from the reversed-phase chromatography were combined, and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator. The peptide was dissolved in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and directly infused into the electrospray interface of a Sciex API-III mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectra were obtained by collision-induced dissociation of the singly charged precursor ion (m/z 471.2) as described (24Taniguchi H. Suzuki M. Manenti S. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22481-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the recombinant proteins and that of peptides to calmodulin were studied using calmodulin-agarose (Sigma). Proteins or peptides were mixed with calmodulin-agarose in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.2 mNaCl. After a short centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge, the supernatants were removed to analyze the unbound fractions. After washing twice with the same buffer, the gel-bound proteins/peptides were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.2 m NaCl and 5 mm EGTA. The fractions obtained were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. 50 nmdansyl-calmodulin (Sigma) was titrated with varying concentrations of myristoylated N-terminal peptide (myr-GGKLSKKKK) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 as described (26Matsubara M. Hayashi N. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23050-23056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Emission spectra were recorded with the excitation wavelength set at 340 nm. Binding of the peptides to calmodulin was monitored by recording the emission at 490 nm. Dissociation constants of calmodulin-peptide complexes were determined by a direct fit of the data to the mass equation (26Matsubara M. Hayashi N. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23050-23056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy of the calmodulin-peptide complex was carried out in a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter as described previously (26Matsubara M. Hayashi N. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23050-23056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Matsubara M. Yamauchi E. Hayashi N. Taniguchi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). First we have characterized the N terminus of CAP-23/NAP-22 purified from rat brain. The purified protein was digested with lysyl endoprotease, and the resulting peptide mixture was subjected to the liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometric analysis. Most of the peptides were assigned by comparing the observed masses with those calculated from the amino acid sequence deduced from the rat cDNA sequence (17Maekawa S. Maekawa M. Hattori S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which established the authenticity of the protein. One peptide eluted from the reversed-phase column near the end of the gradient was subjected to the collision-induced dissociation (Fig.1 a). The results obtained demonstrated clearly that the N-terminal Gly is modified with a myristoyl group. Interestingly, the third amino acid is clearly identified as Gly and not a Ser found in the deduced sequence (17Maekawa S. Maekawa M. Hattori S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequences shows that the third Gly together with other amino acids in the N-terminal region is well conserved among CAP-23/NAP-22 proteins from various species (Fig.1 b), suggesting that the original rat cDNA sequence contains an error at the N terminus. To study the effects of myristoylation on the interaction of CAP-23/NAP-22 with calmodulin, two recombinant proteins, i.e. non-myristoylated and myristoylated proteins, were produced in Escherichia coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The latter was obtained by co-transforming the bacteria with a plasmid containing yeastN-myristoyltransferase gene (21Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The authenticity of the two proteins thus produced was established by mass spectrometry. The mass of the non-myristoylated protein was determined to be 21,629.2 ± 2.9 Da (theoretical mass is 21,629.1 Da for the non-myristoylated protein with the initial Met removed), while that of the myristoylated protein was 21,839.5 ± 2.0 Da (theoretical mass is 21,839.5 Da). These results indicate that the two proteins start with the second Gly residue in the reduced sequence and differ only in the N-terminal myristoylation. The interaction of the recombinant proteins with calmodulin was analyzed by binding to calmodulin-agarose beads. Myristoylated CAP-23/NAP-22 and non-myristoylated-CAP-23/NAP-22 were mixed with calmodulin beads in the presence of Ca2+, and the bound proteins were eluted from the beads with EGTA. As shown in Fig.2 a, the myristoylated protein bound to the calmodulin-agarose, and most of the bound protein was eluted with the Ca2+-free buffer. Therefore, the binding of CAP-23/NAP-22 to calmodulin is Ca2+-dependent, as has been shown with the CAP-23/NAP-22 protein purified from rat brain (20Maekawa S. Murofushi H. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19462-19465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results also suggest that the recombinant protein is fully functional. In contrast, the non-myristoylated protein did not bind to the calmodulin beads to a significant extent under the same conditions. There seems to be absolute requirement of N-terminal myristoylation in the CAP-23/NAP-22-calmodulin interaction. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the myristoylation-dependent calmodulin binding, peptides were synthesized based on the N-terminal sequence and myristoylated using a purified recombinant N-myristoyltransferase in vitro. Their binding to calmodulin was assessed using calmodulin-agarose as above. Surprisingly, not only the longest peptide synthesized containing the N-terminal 18 residues (GGKLSKKKKGYNVNDEKA) but also the shortest peptide of nine amino acids (GGKLSKKKK) showed a similar Ca2+-dependent binding to calmodulin (Fig.2 b). Corresponding non-myristoylated peptides did not show any significant binding to calmodulin. The myristoylated peptide can fully mimic the behavior of the intact protein, suggesting that the myristoylated N-terminal domain is solely responsible for the binding of CAP-23/NAP-22 to calmodulin. A more quantitative analysis was carried out by measuring the fluorescence change of dansyl-calmodulin upon binding of the target peptide (26Matsubara M. Hayashi N. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23050-23056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). While the addition of the myristoylated N-terminal peptide caused a drastic increase in the intensity and a shift of the peak maximum of the emission spectra, little, if any, change was observed with the addition of the non-myristoylated peptide (Fig.2 c). This is in good agreement with the direct binding results studied with calmodulin-agarose, and suggests that the binding of the myristoylated peptide is associated with a conformational change of calmodulin. Using the fluorescence change, the dissociation constant of the short peptide, myr-GGKLSKKKK, was determined from the titration data to be 3.0 nm, which is similar to that observed with the intact myristoylated protein (20Maekawa S. Murofushi H. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19462-19465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These values suggest that the binding of the myristoylated peptide to calmodulin is among the highest of calmodulin-binding proteins (28O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Although calmodulin has been known to bind to phospholipids through hydrophobic interactions, the affinities toward the membrane lipids are very low (29Johnson J.D. Wittenauer L.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 11: 473-479Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of myristic acid to calmodulin did not affect the calmodulin fluorescence (data not shown). These results suggest that the binding of CAP-23/NAP-22 to calmodulin involves specific interactions rather than simple hydrophobic interactions between calmodulin and the myristoyl moiety. To elucidate the amino acid residues involved in the binding, the myristoylated peptide (myr-GGKLSKKKK) was partially digested with lysyl endoprotease and a mixture of myristoylated peptides of varying length was produced. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the mixture contained myr-GGKLSKKKK, myr-GGKLSKK, myr-GGKLSK, and myr-GGK. The mixture was incubated with calmodulin-agarose, and the unbound and bound fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig.3). The longest peptide was almost completely bound to the agarose, and no significant amounts of the peptide was detected in the unbound fraction. In contrast, the shortest peptide, myr-GGK, did not show any significant binding under the conditions employed. The two other peptides showed intermediate binding characteristics (50% and 30% binding for myr-GGKLSKK and myr-GGKLSK, respectively, calculated from the peak intensities). The affinity of the peptides in the decreasing order is myr-GGKLSKKKK > myr-GGKLSKK > myr-GGKLSK > myr-GGK. Clearly, the presence of four consecutive Lys residues is important for the binding. Since the shortest peptide, myr-GGK, did not bind to calmodulin to significant extent, the binding of the myristoylated N-terminal peptides is effected not only by simple hydrophobic interaction between the myristoyl group and the hydrophobic part of calmodulin, but also involves specific interactions. In this context, it is of interest to note that the replacement of the second Gly with a Ser, which was found in the original deduced sequence, resulted in the reduced binding affinity by 1 order of magnitude (data not shown). These results again support our view that the peptide moiety plays an important role in the interaction, and that specific structural requirements exist to achieve a high affinity binding of nanomolar range. To understand the structural basis of CAP-23/NAP-22 binding to calmodulin, CD spectra of the myristoylated N-terminal domain peptide and those of calmodulin complex were measured. It has been shown that peptides derived from calmodulin-binding domain of target proteins assume random structures in solution, but form α-helical structures in calmodulin complex. Since the overall secondary structures of calmodulin, and hence the α-helical content, do not change appreciably, changes in CD spectra associated with complex formation are mainly attributed to the change in the target proteins (30Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). CD spectrum of the equimolar complex of the N-terminal peptide and calmodulin was compared with the mathematical sum of those of the individual components. As shown in Fig.4, there was practically no change upon the complex formation. The peptide alone in solution showed a CD spectrum with a single negative peak below 200 nm, which is characteristic for a random coil (data not shown). These results suggest that the conformation of the myristoylated peptide do not change upon calmodulin binding, and the peptide assumes a non-helical conformation in the complex. Phosphorylation of the intact protein by PKC has been shown to abolish its interaction with calmodulin (20Maekawa S. Murofushi H. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19462-19465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have examined whether the N-terminal peptide (myr-GGKLSKKKK) can be phosphorylated by PKC, and if it can, whether the phosphorylation affects the binding of the myristoylated N-terminal peptide with calmodulin. Both myristoylated and non-myristoylated N-terminal peptides were stoichiometrically phosphorylated by PKC as shown by mass spectrometry (Fig.5 a). Since the peptides contained only one phosphorylatable residue, we concluded that Ser5 is the phosphorylation site by PKC. Phosphorylation by PKC abolished the binding of the peptide to calmodulin completely, as is the case with the intact myristoylated protein (Fig. 5 b). From these results, we conclude that the myristoylated N-terminal basic domain is the sole calmodulin-binding and PKC phosphorylation domain of CAP-23/NAP-22, and that the interaction with calmodulin is regulated by the phosphorylation of a single Ser in the domain. Since the N-terminal myristoylated domain is phosphorylated by PKC, it is of interest to examine whether the phosphorylation is affected by myristoylation. Both myristoylated and non-myristoylated CAP-23/NAP-22 were incubated with purified PKC, and the resulting mixtures were analyzed by mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 6, both proteins were stoichiometrically phosphorylated, but there was a clear difference in the time course. The myristoylated protein was almost completely phosphorylated after 10-min incubation, while only 60% of the non-myristoylated protein was phosphorylated at that time. Therefore, the myristoylation seems to facilitate the interaction of CAP-23/NAP-22 with PKC. In the present report, we could narrow down the calmodulin-binding domain of CAP-23/NAP-22 to the myristoyl moiety together with the nine-amino acid N-terminal domain (myristoyl-GGKLSKKKK). Even a shorter peptide (myristoyl-GGKLSK) binds to calmodulin albeit weakly. Addition of each basic Lys increases the affinity to calmodulin incrementally. Since a myristoylated peptide consisting of the myristoyl moiety and the first 18 N-terminal amino acids showed an affinity similar to that of the nine-amino acid peptide (data not shown), the first 9 amino acids should suffice for calmodulin binding. As is the case for the typical calmodulin-binding motif (31Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar), the interaction between the basic residues of the binding protein and the acidic residues of calmodulin seems to play an important role in the binding. However, a more striking result is the fact that the binding of the intact CAP-23/NAP-22 protein as well as that of the N-terminal peptide is dependent on the presence of the myristoyl moiety. A closer look at the N-terminal sequence immediately shows that the domain contains one hydrophobic residue (Leu) in addition to the five basic amino acids (Lys). This is actually reminiscent of the canonical calmodulin-binding motif, a basic amphiphilic motif, in which basic hydrophilic residues and hydrophobic ones appears alternatingly (28O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar,32Blumenthal D.K. Takio K. Edelman A.M. Charbonneau H. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3187-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the calmodulin-binding domain of CAP-23/NAP-22, a hydrophobic acyl group is followed by a basic Lys residue, which is followed by a hydrophobic Leu residue. If one assumes that the acyl group can substitute large hydrophobic amino acids such as Trp and Leu found in the canonical binding motif, the overall structural characteristics are very similar. A canonical motif, however, would span a minimal length of 12 amino acids between the two critical hydrophobic residues (31Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). However, when the CAP-23/NAP-22 peptide assumes an elongated structure, the distance between the myristoyl moiety and Leu4 is comparable to that between the two critical hydrophobic amino acids found in the target proteins (Fig.7). A CD spectrum of the myristoylated peptide-calmodulin complex, in fact, suggests that the peptide assumes an elongated structure rather than typical α-helix. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the acyl chain interacts with the hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin, while the Leu4interacts with that in the N-terminal lobe in a manner analogous to the other canonical calmodulin-binding motif (31Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). In fact, the hydrophobic caves offered by calmodulin for the hydrophobic interactions have very flexible structures and can fit a large variety of target proteins. CAP-23/NAP-22 is not the only example of calmodulin target protein that assumes a non-helical structure in the calmodulin complex. We have recently shown that the calmodulin-binding domain of MARCKS binds to calmodulin in a non-helical elongated structure despite the classical basic amphiphilic character (27Matsubara M. Yamauchi E. Hayashi N. Taniguchi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have also pointed out the presence of a novel class of calmodulin-binding proteins that assume non-helical structures in calmodulin complex. The calmodulin-binding domains of these proteins are characterized by the dominance of basic amino acids contrary to the canonical motif in which hydrophobic amino acids are dominant (27Matsubara M. Yamauchi E. Hayashi N. Taniguchi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is, of course, not easy to estimate the hydrophobicity of the CAP-23/NAP-22 calmodulin-binding domain, which clearly constitutes a third class of calmodulin-binding proteins. However, the fact that the myristoyl group has only weak or intermediate hydrophobicity compared with large hydrophobic amino acids (5Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and the fact that the basic amino acids are important in the CAP-23/NAP-22-calmodulin interaction, may suggest a close relationship of CAP-23/NAP-22 to the non-classical class of the target proteins. The elucidation of the three-dimensional structures should yield a more insight into the structural consideration of these proteins. Protein myristoylation has been implicated in the regulation of various signal transduction proteins (4Resh M.D. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 5Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is obvious that the modification is essential for the membrane targeting of these proteins (4Resh M.D. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 7Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the presence of a myristoyl group is not enough for the stable membrane anchoring of these proteins. A basic amino acid cluster is often found near the acyl group (33Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), and the two domains work cooperatively in the reversible membrane binding of these proteins (34McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Either protein phosphorylation or calmodulin binding regulates the reversible membrane binding. Since CAP-23/NAP-22 seems to be anchored to membrane through its N-terminal domain (35Maekawa S. Matsuura Y. Nakamura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and since the same domain binds calmodulin and PKC, the membrane association of CAP-23/NAP-22 may be regulated in a similar manner. In contrast to the role in the membrane binding, the role of protein myristoylation in the protein-protein interaction is still largely unknown. However, the three-dimensional structure of recoverin revealed the presence of direct interaction of the acyl group with its own protein moiety (9Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 36Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The effects on protein stability found in cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calcineurin also imply some kind of interaction between the myristoyl group and protein parts. Furthermore, we have already shown that the N-terminal myristoylation modulates the MARCKS-calmodulin interaction (37Manenti S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6878-6881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the involvement of the modification in the protein-protein interactions has also been speculated in G proteins (38Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In the present report, we have also shown that the myristoylation affects the phosphorylation of peptides by PKC. Therefore, protein myristoylation may be also involved in the protein-protein interaction between PKC and its substrate proteins. In fact, potentiation of PKC inhibitor peptides by N-terminal myristoylation has been reported (39O'Brian C.A. Ward N.E. Liskamp R.M. de Bont D.B. van Boom J.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and even the presence of a myristyl binding site in PKC has been speculated (41Zaliani A. Pinori M. Ball H.L. DiGregorio G. Cremonesi P. Mascagni P. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results raise the possibility that the protein myristoylation plays direct roles in the protein-protein interaction of various proteins. We thank Dr. J. I. Gordon for providingN-myristoyltransferase expression vector."

The LPS signaling cascade leading to TNF-α production bifurcates to control both transcription of the TNF-α gene and translation of TNF-α mRNA (5Beutler B. Krochin N. Milsark I.W. Luedke C. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Translational regulation of TNF-α mRNA is mediated by a short AU-rich sequence that is conserved among various cytokines and oncogenes and is present within the 3′-untranslated regions of such genes (6Kruys V. Marinz O. Shaw G. Deschamps J. Huez G. Science. 1989; 245: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This element confers a repression of translation that must be overcome in order for translation to proceed (7Beutler B. Han J. Kruys V. Giroir B.P. Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors: the Molecules and Their Emerging Role in Medicine. Raven Press, New York1992: 561-574Google Scholar, 8Han J. Beutler B. Eur.

Recent studies also suggest a role for this element in destabilization of TNF-α mRNA (12Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling molecules shown to play a role in translational regulation of TNF-α mRNA include p38 (13Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar) and Jun-N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) (14Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, as well as the more proximal signaling molecules Raf and Ras (15Geppert T.D. Whitehurst C.E. Thompson P. Beutler B. Mol. Med. 1994; 1: 93-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of the TNF-α gene is quite complex; differences exist across species as well as among cell types. Regulation of TNF-α transcription is conferred by transcription factor binding sites present within the TNF-α promoter. The cis-acting elements within the TNF-α promoter that are conserved among species include a Y box motif, an SP-1 binding site, as well as multiple nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) sites (16Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 17Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, the human TNF-α promoter contains an AP-1 site (18Leitman D.C. Ribeiro R.C.J. Mackow E.R. Baxter J.D. West B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9343-9346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPS induction of both murine and human TNF-α promoter activity is dependent on NF-κB binding sites. Mutation or deletion of such sites results in a loss of LPS responsiveness, whereas multiple copies of the NF-κB sites inserted in front of a reporter gene are LPS-responsive (16Shakhov A.N.

Furthermore, compounds that inhibit NF-κB block TNF-α transcription and TNF-α production in human monocytes (21Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Sternsdorf T. Liese J. Belohradsky B. Weber C. Wedel A. Schreck R. Baeuerle P. Strobel M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6986-6993PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence arguing against a role for NF-κB in regulation of human TNF-α gene transcription exists (22Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 23Goldfeld A.E. Strominger J.L. Doyle C. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the discrepancy may be due to the stimulus used to induce TNF-α promoter activity, as well as the cell type. LPS treatment of macrophages stimulates the nuclear mobilization of NF-κB (24Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Muller J.M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Baeuerle P.A. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 233-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, NF-κB is found in a cytoplasmic complex with an inhibitory protein, inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) (26Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Many signals that lead to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB result in the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB. Phosphorylation of Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκB-α targets IκB-α for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus (27Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 28Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T.

Recently, two kinases have been identified that inducibly phosphorylate IκB: IκB kinase-1 (IKK-1), also called IKK-α (30Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

IKK-1 and IKK-2 show 52% identity at the amino acid level and can exist in a heterodimer that is able to interact with another kinase called NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). NIK was originally identified based on its ability to bind to TNF-receptor-associated factor 2 and is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase (MEKK) family (35Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Co-expression of NIK with IKK-1 or IKK-2 enhances IKK activity, whereas overexpression of a kinase mutant NIK blocks cytokine-induced NF-κB activation (30Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 34Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Another kinase implicated in the regulation of NF-κB activation is MEKK1. MEKK1 activates an IκB-α kinase complex (36Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 37Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13234-13238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MEKK1 is required for Tax-induced NF-κB activation (39Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and is involved in FcεRI-induced activation of the human TNF-α promoter (40Ishizuka T. Terada N. Gerwins P. Hamelmann E. Oshiba A. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6358-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We set out to determine the signaling events initiated by LPS that lead to activation of the murine TNF-α promoter. This promoter lacks elements, such as AP-1, present in the human promoter, thereby allowing a more straightforward analysis of the underlying signaling mechanisms using a physiological promoter. Here, we demonstrate a requirement for one or both IKKs and examine roles of NIK and MEKK1 in LPS-induced TNF-α transcription. Expression vectors containing the constitutively active version of MEKK-1 (MEKK-C) and dominant-negative MEKK-1 (D1369A) were described previously (41Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M.

The FLAG-tagged wild-type IKK-2, dominant-negative IKK-2 (S177A/S181A), FLAG-tagged wild-type IKK-1, and dominant-negative IKK-1 (S176A/S180A) constructs were described previously (31Mercurio F.

Wild-type and dominant-negative NIK (K429A/K430A) were also described previously (39Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The TNF-α transcriptional reporter (TNFpro-CAT) was provided by B. Beutler and was described previously (14Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB reporter (NF-κB-luc) consisted of a triple repeat of the human immunodeficiency virus NF-κB site driving a luciferase cDNA and was provided by A. Thorburn. The dominant-negative IκB construct (IκB-α SS32, 36AA) was provided by R. Gaynor. RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2-mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using the Profection DNA transfection kit (DEAE-dextran) from Promega and following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. DNA amounts transfected were kept constant by the addition of empty expression vector. Where indicated, cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) or diluent (sterile saline). Cells were treated with LPS for 6 h for both luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays. CAT assays were performed as described previously (14Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CAT activity was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Data are represented as percent conversion of chloramphenicol to acetylated chloramphenicol. Luciferase assays were performed using the luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and following the manufacturer's protocol. Where indicated, FLAG-IKK-1 and FLAG-IKK-2 were immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of protein (2 mg) from lysates of transfected RAW 264.7 cells using 1 μg of the M-2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. Where indicated, endogenous IKK-1 and IKK-2 were immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of lysates using 1 μg of anti-IKK-1 (M-280; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-IKK-2 (H-470; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively, for 4 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. Protein A-Sepharose was added to each immunoprecipitate for 1.5 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The pellets were resuspended in kinase buffer with 50 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample, and 9 μg/sample of glutathioneS-transferase-IκB (amino acids, 1-54). The reactions were carried out for 35 min at 30 °C. Samples were centrifuged, supernatants were added to Laemmli buffer, and the mixtures were boiled for 2 min. Aliquots were loaded on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. LPS is a potent inducer of TNF-α biosynthesis, activating both transcription of the TNF-α gene and translation of TNF-α mRNA. We previously demonstrated that multiple kinase signaling pathways are stimulated by LPS and that the JNK/SAPK pathway is required for translational induction of TNF-α by LPS (14Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we found no requirement for JNK/SAPK in LPS-induced TNF-α transcription, despite the previously described effects of JNK/SAPK on TNF-α transcription in another system (14Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,40Ishizuka T. Terada N. Gerwins P. Hamelmann E. Oshiba A. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6358-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have explored signaling pathways leading to LPS-induced TNF-α promoter activity. It is well documented that LPS activates NF-κB and that NF-κB is crucial for LPS induction of TNF-α gene transcription (20Udalova I. Knight J.C. Vidal V. Nedospasov S.A. Kwiatkowski D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21178-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Sternsdorf T. Liese J. Belohradsky B. Weber C. Wedel A. Schreck R.

Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Baeuerle P.A. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 233-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). As a starting point for our experiments, we confirmed that LPS could induce NF-κB activation, as well as TNF-α promoter activity in our system. We transiently transfected RAW 264.7 cells with an NF-κB reporter (NF-κB-luc) or a TNF-α transcriptional reporter consisting of the murine TNF-α promoter driving a CAT cDNA (TNFpro-CAT). After 24 h, cells were stimulated with LPS or diluent for 6 h and were harvested for assessment of luciferase or CAT activity. LPS enhanced NF-κB and TNF-α promoter activity, as demonstrated by an increase in luciferase (Fig. 1 A, left) or CAT activity (Fig. 1 A, right) in LPS-treated cells, over that in control cells. The stimulation across experiments was variable, ranging from 2- to 20-fold. To determine the extent to which NF-κB contributes to LPS-induced TNF-α promoter activity, we tested whether overexpression of a dominant-negative IκB could inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 1 B, overexpression of the dominant-negative IκB completely abolished LPS-induced TNF promoter activity. Because LPS induction of the TNF-α promoter appears strongly linked to NF-κB (20Udalova I. Knight J.C. Vidal V. Nedospasov S.A. Kwiatkowski D. J. Biol.

Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 233-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we set out to examine the signaling molecules involved in NF-κB activation by LPS. Recently, two kinases, IKK-1 and IKK-2, were identified that phosphorylate IκB, releasing NF-κB, leading to its nuclear translocation (30Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). To determine whether LPS is capable of activating IKK-1 or IKK-2, we immunoprecipitated endogenous IKK-1 or IKK-2 from lysates of RAW 264.7 cells that had been treated with LPS for varying amounts of time or from unstimulated cells (control). After immunoprecipitation, IKK-1 or IKK-2 activity was assessed in vitroin the presence of [γ-32P]ATP using bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-IκB (amino acid, 1-54) as a substrate. As shown in Fig.2 A, LPS activates both IKK-1 and IKK-2. Peak activity occurred 15 min poststimulation and rapidly decreased within 30 min. Because LPS activates an NF-κB reporter and IKK activity, we wanted to determine whether IKK-1 or IKK-2 is involved in LPS induction of TNF-α promoter activity. RAW 264.7 cells were transiently co-transfected with TNFpro-CAT, and either empty vector (control) or inhibitory mutants of IKK-1 (IKK-1 SS/AA) or IKK-2 (IKK-2 SS/AA). These are phosphorylation-defective mutants previously shown to block IκB phosphorylation (39Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with diluent or LPS for 6 h and harvested for assessment of CAT activity. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both dominant-negative IKK-2 and dominant-negative IKK-1 decreased basal promoter activity and inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α promoter activity. The inhibitory effect was greater with IKK-2. Similar results were obtained with the NF-κB reporter (data not shown). Thus, one or possibly both IKKs are required for LPS-induced regulation of TNF-α transcription. These results further emphasize the predominant role of NF-κB in the LPS-mediated transcription of TNF-α. NIK and MEKK1 can activate IKK-1 or IKK-2 in HeLa cells and fibroblasts (34Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar,37Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We examined the roles of NIK and MEKK1 in the regulation of IKK-1 or IKK-2 in macrophages. We transiently co-transfected a FLAG-tagged IKK-1 or IKK-2 with increasing amounts of either NIK or a constitutively active version of MEKK1 (MEKKC). Overexpression of either NIK or MEKKC activated IKK-2 by 50-fold or more, whereas neither activated IKK-1, although equal amounts of IKKs were present (Fig.3 A and data not shown). To determine the possible requirement of NIK or MEKK1 for LPS induction of IKK-2 activity, we co-expressed FLAG-tagged IKK-2 with either empty vector (control), a dominant-negative NIK (NIK KK/AA), or a dominant-negative MEKK1 (MEKK1 D/A) in RAW 264.7 cells. After 29 h, the cells were treated with LPS or diluent for the indicated amounts of time. As shown in Fig. 3 B, dominant-negative NIK and dominant-negative MEKK-1 were each able to block LPS-induced IKK-2 activity. These results suggest functions for both NIK and MEKK-1 in LPS induction of IKK-2 activity. However, because each of these proteins may bind to IKK2, it is possible that they could sequester it, preventing activation by other kinases. Because NIK and MEKK1 stimulated IKK-2 activity (Fig. 3 A), we examined their effects on LPS-induced TNF-α promoter activity. RAW 264.7 cells transiently transfected with the TNF-α transcriptional reporter and either a dominant-negative NIK or a dominant-negative MEKK1 were treated with LPS or diluent. As shown in Fig. 3 C, expression of either dominant-negative NIK (right) or dominant-negative MEKK1 (left) abolished LPS induction of TNF-α promoter activity. Similar results were obtained with the NF-κB reporter (Fig.3 D). These results further suggest a role for NIK and MEKK-1 in LPS induction of the TNF-α promoter. Overexpression of MEKK1 activates the human TNF-α promoter (40Ishizuka T. Terada N. Gerwins P. Hamelmann E. Oshiba A. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6358-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and NF-κB (37Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 39Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) in other systems. Because kinase-dead NIK and MEKK1 block LPS-induced TNF-α promoter activity, we tested whether overexpression of NIK or MEKK1 could induce TNF-α promoter activity in the absence of exogenous stimuli. We co-expressed the TNF-α transcriptional reporter with either NIK or MEKK1 (MEKKC) in RAW 264.7 cells. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with either diluent or LPS and cells were harvested for assessment of CAT activity. As shown in Fig.4, in the absence of LPS, overexpression of NIK induced TNF-α promoter activity to a level above that obtained with LPS stimulation alone. LPS did not appear to enhance the ability of NIK to activate the TNF-α promoter. In a similar manner, in the absence of LPS, overexpression of MEKK-1 activated the TNF-α promoter. However, the effects of LPS and MEKK1 were nearly additive in inducing the TNF-α transcriptional reporter. Similar results were obtained using the NF-κB reporter (data not shown). Thus, NIK and MEKK1 are able to induce TNF-α promoter activity in the absence of exogenous stimuli. Because LPS further enhances activation of TNF-α promoter activity by MEKK1, but not by NIK, it may be that MEKK1 is acting by a distinct mechanism. Because NIK and MEKK1 can stimulate IKK-2, we tested whether IKK-2 was required for NIK- or MEKK1-induced TNF-α promoter activity. We transiently transfected the TNF-α transcriptional reporter with empty expression vector, MEKK1 (MEKKC), or NIK in the presence or absence of dominant-negative IKK-2 (IKK2 SS/AA). As shown in Fig. 5, overexpression of dominant-negative IKK-2 inhibited NIK- and MEKK1-induced TNF-α promoter activity. Similarly, overexpression of a dominant-negative IKK1 (IKK-1 SS/AA) blocked NIK- and MEKK1-induced TNF-α promoter activity, despite the fact that neither NIK nor MEKK1 activated IKK1 in these cells (Fig. 5). In this study, we investigated the signaling pathways initiated by LPS that are involved in transcriptional regulation of the TNF-α gene in macrophages. In confirmation of earlier findings concerning regulation of the TNF-α promoter, our work indicates that most or all of the signaling leading to TNF-α transcription is mediated by NF-κB. This conclusion is based, in part, on the finding that dominant-negative IκB completely inhibits LPS-induced TNF-α promoter activity. Dominant-negative IKKs fully block LPS induction of the TNF-α promoter, further implicating NF-κB as the primary mediator of LPS-induced TNF-α promoter activity. In a previous study examining transcriptional regulation of the human TNF-α promoter, it was determined that a dominant-negative JNK/SAPK interfered with FcεRI induction of transcription in mast cells (40Ishizuka T. Terada N. Gerwins P. Hamelmann E. Oshiba A. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6358-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We showed that dominant-negative JNK/SAPK had no effect on LPS induction of the murine TNF-α promoter in macrophages (14Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of TNF-α transcription differs among species and/or cell types. Indeed, the human promoter contains elements, such as an AP-1 site, that are not present in the murine promoter (18Leitman D.C. Ribeiro R.C.J. Mackow E.R. Baxter J.D. West B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9343-9346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which NF-κB becomes activated by LPS has not been examined. We demonstrate that LPS activates the recently identified IκB kinases, IKK-1 and IKK-2. LPS stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells resulted in similar kinetics of activation for both IKK-1 and IKK-2. We established roles for IKK-2 and IKK-1 in LPS induction of TNF-α transcription by demonstrating that overexpression of dominant-negative versions of either IKK blocked LPS induction of the murine TNF-α promoter. Because IKK-1 and IKK-2 form heterodimers (3Tracey K.J. Beutler B. Lowry S.F. Merryweather J. Wolpe S. Milsark I.W. Hariri R.J. Fahey III, T.J. Zentella A. Albert J.D. Shires G.T. Cerami A.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), it is not possible to determine whether one or the other is more important using these approaches. Because LPS induces TNF-α production in macrophages, one could argue that the effects on the IKKs are caused by an autocrine mechanism. This, however, is not the case because of the rapid kinetics of IKK activation. We determined that LPS induced activation of other signaling molecules, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases, p38, JNK/SAPK, MEKs 1, 3, 4, and 6, 30–60 min poststimulation in macrophages (14Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of IKKs peaks within 15 min of LPS stimulation. Therefore, IKK activation is among the earliest signaling events known to be induced by LPS in macrophages. To test possible links between LPS and the IKKs, we examined two IKK kinases, NIK and MEKK1. Both NIK and MEKK1 stimulate IKK-2 activity in RAW 264.7 cells, and both NIK and MEKK1 are sufficient to activate not only an NF-κB reporter but also the TNF-α promoter in the absence of ligand. Additional findings suggesting that NIK and MEKK1 may both be involved in LPS-mediated transcriptional regulation of the TNF-α gene come from studies with kinase-defective mutants. Either kinase-dead NIK or MEKK1 blocks the induction of IKK-2 activity and induction of the TNF-α promoter by LPS. These results may indicate that both enzymes are required. Alternatively, they may block NF-κB by sequestering IKK-2 or NF-κB activation complexes. Our results suggest roles for IKK-1, IKK-2, or both, in LPS-induced signaling to the TNF-α promoter. However, we propose that IKK-2 is the more significant mediator of LPS-induced signaling to the TNF-α promoter, since known IKK kinases lead to activation of IKK-2, not IKK-1. LPS-induced IKK activity observed in the IKK-1 immunoprecipitates could be due to the presence of IKK-2. Dominant-negative IKK-1 inhibited LPS-, MEKK1-, and NIK-induced TNF-α promoter, and NF-κB activity could also be attributed to the fact that the IKKs form heterodimers (3Tracey K.J. Beutler B. Lowry S.F. Merryweather J. Wolpe S. Milsark I.W. Hariri R.J. Fahey III, T.J. Zentella A. Albert J.D. Shires G.T. Cerami A.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of dominant-negative IKK-1 could interfere with IKK-2 function; more extensive studies are necessary to determine such matters definitively. It is clear that regulation of NF-κB is complex, as multiple kinases and other molecules, such as NF-κB essential modulator (43Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), appear to be involved. Here, we establish a role for IKKs in LPS-induced NF-κB activation and, more importantly, in LPS induction of TNF-α transcription. Most studies about IKKs merely demonstrate a role for IKKs in the regulation of NF-κB, using NF-κB reporters consisting of multiple copies of a particular site driving the expression of a reporter gene. Our studies establish a potential mechanism for initiation of TNF-α promoter activity, thus providing a better understanding of the regulation of such an important inflammatory mediator.

Our previous studies identified a pore histidine as a major component of the acid activation mechanism of the potato guard cell K+ channel KST1 (1Hoth S. Dreyer I. Dietrich P. Becker D.

Although this histidine is highly conserved among all plant K+ uptake channels cloned so far, the pH-dependent gating of the Arabidopsis thaliana guard cell K+ channel KAT1 was not affected by mutations of this histidine. In both channels, KST1 and KAT1, aspartate mutants in the K+ channel consensus sequence GYGD adjacent to the histidine (KST1-D269N and KAT1-D265N) were inhibited by a rise in the extracellular proton concentration. pH changes affected the half-maximal activation voltage V 12 of the KST1 mutant, whereas in the mutant channel KAT1-D265N an acid-induced decrease in the maximum conductance g maxindicated the presence of a proton block. In contrast to the wild type KST1, the S4-mutant channel KST1-R181Q exhibited an activation upon alcalization of the extracellular solution. From our electrophysiological studies on channel mutants with respect to the pore histidine as well as the aspartate, we conclude that the common proton-supported shift in the voltage dependence of KST1 and KAT1 is based on distinct molecular elements.

Extracellular protons shift the voltage dependence of the hyperpolarization-activated Kin+ channels in guard cells to more positive voltages and thereby facilitate K+ uptake. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the guard cell K+channel α-subunits KST1 and KAT1 maintained a pH dependence in the absence of the biochemical machinery of the plant motor cell (1Hoth S. Dreyer I.

A common structure of the pore region and the ion-conducting pathway for tetrameric K+ channels is predicted from x-ray studies on theStreptomyces lividans K+ channel KcsA (16Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M.

This structure includes the two membrane-spanning helices of each subunit adjacent to the pore loop (S5-S6 in Shaker-type channels). In contrast to KcsA four additional transmembrane segments (S1-S4) for the Shaker-type and the plant Kin+ channels are proposed from hydrophobicity analyses. Mutations in the positively charged transmembrane helix S4 revealed that this segment represents part of the voltage sensor of the six-transmembrane channels (17Papazian D.M. Timpe L.C. Jan Y.N.

Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) KST1 contains only two extracellular histidines. Both residues are key amino acids of the pH-sensing structure (1Hoth S. Dreyer I. Dietrich P. Becker D. Müller-Röber B. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). While the double mutant KST1-H160A/H271A completely lacks pH-dependent gating, a single mutation to arginine at position 271 even resulted in an inverted pH dependence. Because this histidine is highly conserved in plant K+ channels only, it was predicted that acid activation based on the pore histidine represents a plant-specific feature. To test this hypothesis we studied another guard cell Kin+ channel, KAT1, with respect to the structural basis for its acid activation. Histidine, aspartate, and glutamate mutants were generated in the plant K+ channel consensus sequence GYGDXH and electrophysiologically characterized in comparison to the wild type after expression in Xenopus oocytes.DISCUSSIONThe use of site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological characterization of the generated channel mutants enabled the identification of structural elements essential for the K+ selectivity, susceptibility toward blockers, voltage dependence, and pH regulation of plant K+ channels (1Hoth S.

In this study, we examined the molecular basis for acid activation of the two guard cell K+ uptake channel α-subunits KAT1 and KST1. The steady-state currents of both channels increase upon acidification of the extracellular solution. A comparable pH dependence was observed in another potato Kin+ channel, SKT1, and in the maize channel ZMK1, which both represent members of the AKT1 family (15Zimmermann S. Talke I. Ehrhardt T. Nast G. Müller-Röber B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 2K. Philippar, I. Fuchs, H. Lüthen, S. Hoth, C. Bauer, K. Haga, G. Thiel, G. Ljung, G. Sandberg, M. Böttger, D. Becker, and R. Hedrich, submitted for publication. Acid activation of KST1 and KAT1 is mediated by a shift of the half-maximal activation voltage to more positive voltages with decreasing extracellular pH (Fig. 1 B and Refs. 1Hoth S. Dreyer I.

Plant J. 1995; 7: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This pH-dependent shift has been shown to depend on the only two extracellular histidine residues in KST1 (1Hoth S. Dreyer I. Dietrich P. Becker D. Müller-Röber B. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In view of the conservation of this pore histidine in all cloned Kin+ channels, we supposed a plant-specific pH-sensing structure. Because in KAT1 mutations of the corresponding histidine at position 267, H267A and H267R, did not affect the pH-dependent gating properties (Fig.1 C), the acid-induced voltage shift seems not just based on this histidine. Evidence for the existence of additional sites is further supported by our recent studies on the Arabidopsis thaliana K+ channel AKT3, which contains this pore histidine, too, but is blocked by protons. 3I. Marten, S. Hoth, R. Deeken, P. Ache, K. Ketchum, R. Hedrich, and T. Hoshi, submitted for publication. In contrast to all plant K+ uptake channels but in line with the animal Kin+ channels (30Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 31Sabirov R.Z. Okada Y. Oiki S. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in AKT3 extracellular protons reduce the single channel conductance rather than the voltage dependence.The K+ channel blocker TEA+ has been used successfully to localize amino acid residues of the outward rectifyingShaker K+ channel. Thereby MacKinnon and Yellen (32MacKinnon R. Yellen G. Science. 1990; 250: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) identified a threonine residue at position 449 inShaker mediating TEA+ blockade. This position corresponds to the position of the pore histidine in KAT1 and KST1. In blocking studies with extracellular TEA+, we could show that substitution of the histidine by alanine resulted in an almost TEA+-insensitive phenotype (Fig. 2). In homology to theShaker-type channels, the requirement of the histidine for the TEA+ block of KAT1 and KST1 indicates its localization in the outer pore of both guard cell channel proteins. The same conclusion has been drawn from Cs+ and TEA+inhibition experiments on the KAT1 double-mutant KAT1-H267T/E269V (33Ichida A.M. Schroeder J.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the elimination of the histidine residue might be sufficient to explain the reduced TEA+ sensitivity of this double mutant. Furthermore the identical selectivity of KST1 wild type and the channel mutant KST1-H271A 4S. Hoth and R. Hedrich, unpublished results. suggests that the constrained geometry of the selectivity filter (16Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5684) Google Scholar) is not affected by an adjacent single mutation.The KAT1 and KST1 α-subunits are expressed in guard cells and share the basic features of the in vivo characterized GCKC1in channels (guard cellK+channel 1,inward rectifying) from A. thaliana andSolanum tuberosum, respectively (4Brüggemann L. Dietrich P. Dreyer I. Hedrich R. Planta. 1998; 207: 370-376Google Scholar, 7Müller-Röber B. Busch H. Ellenberg J. Becker D. Provart N. Dietrich P. Willmitzer L. Hoth S. Hedrich R.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In contrast to the potato channels, the GCKC1 from A. thaliana have been shown to operate at more acidic pH values. This difference was also observed between KAT1 and KST1 when expressed in Xenopusoocytes (Fig. 1 B) and might point to the participation of acidic amino acids like aspartate or glutamate within the pH sensor of KAT1. The consequently generated aspartate mutant KAT1-D265N, however, revealed a proton block rather than an acid-induced shift in the voltage dependence (Fig. 3 B). Probably the same blocking mechanism underlies the inverted pH dependence of the KAT1 mutant Y263R in the GYGD consensus sequence (27Nakamura R.L. Anderson J.A. Gaber R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1011-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutations in the two pore glutamates of KAT1 either did not affect the pH sensitivity (KAT1-H267T/E269V; Ref. 33Ichida A.M. Schroeder J.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or did not produce functional K+ channels (KAT1-E273A or KAT1-E273R; data not shown). Thus, the importance of the aspartate at position 265 for pH sensing is unique with respect to carboxylate residues within the KAT1 pore. In KST1, however, in addition to the histidine we identified the pore aspartate as a key amino acid of the pH sensor. As described for the histidine mutant KST1-H271R (1Hoth S. Dreyer I. Dietrich P. Becker D. Müller-Röber B. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the mutant channel KST1-D269N showed an inverted pH dependence with respect to the half-maximal activation voltage V 12 (Fig. 3 B). Because all described histidine and the aspartate mutants changed the gating properties of KST1 in a pH-dependent manner, a molecular link between the pH and the voltage sensor was anticipated. The arginine residue at position 181 in the S4 segment represents a candidate for this interaction, because the voltage-dependent mutant channel KST1-R181Q shifted by about 90 mV more positive and reversed its pH dependence. Studies on the topology of the KAT1 channel following expression inEscherichia coli show an interaction of amino acids in the transmembrane segments S3 and S4 like in animal channels (28Tiwari-Woodruff S.K.

Because the histidine at position 160 in the S3-S4 linker of KST1 is part of the pH sensor, an interaction between His160 and Arg181 might relate the voltage and pH sensor to each other. Because it is impossible, however, to judge from this one mutation in S4 whether this putative connection is of minor or major importance in coupling, further mutations are required to elucidate the complete structural link to the pH sensor.In conclusion, we could show that the proton-triggered shift in the voltage dependence of KAT1 and KST1 is based on distinct amino acids. Whereas in KST1 the histidine as well as the aspartate play a crucial role in pH sensing, both residues do not contribute to the pH-dependent gating in KAT1. In future experiments, chimera between plant K+ channels with altered pH phenotype will help to identify in detail the distinct pH-sensitive domains and key residues therein. In the stomatal complex, acid-activated K+ uptake into guard cells through inward rectifying K+ channels (Kin+ channels) is fundamental for the turgor-driven volume changes in guard cells (2Blatt M.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 615-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 3Ilan N. Schwartz A. Moran N. J. Membr.

Extracellular protons shift the voltage dependence of the hyperpolarization-activated Kin+ channels in guard cells to more positive voltages and thereby facilitate K+ uptake. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the guard cell K+channel α-subunits KST1 and KAT1 maintained a pH dependence in the absence of the biochemical machinery of the plant motor cell (1Hoth S. Dreyer I.

Thus, the activation of these K+ uptake channels, upon a rise in the apoplastic proton concentration, requires a protein-intrinsic pH sensor. All plant Kin+ channel α-subunits cloned so far are structurally related to the Shaker gene family of outward rectifying K+ channels and toShaker-like hyperpolarization-activated K+-permeable channels (7Müller-Röber B.

A common structure of the pore region and the ion-conducting pathway for tetrameric K+ channels is predicted from x-ray studies on theStreptomyces lividans K+ channel KcsA (16Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M.

This structure includes the two membrane-spanning helices of each subunit adjacent to the pore loop (S5-S6 in Shaker-type channels). In contrast to KcsA four additional transmembrane segments (S1-S4) for the Shaker-type and the plant Kin+ channels are proposed from hydrophobicity analyses. Mutations in the positively charged transmembrane helix S4 revealed that this segment represents part of the voltage sensor of the six-transmembrane channels (17Papazian D.M. Timpe L.C. Jan Y.N.

Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2953-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). With regard to the proposed structure for the six-transmembrane K+ channels (23Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) KST1 contains only two extracellular histidines. Both residues are key amino acids of the pH-sensing structure (1Hoth S. Dreyer I. Dietrich P. Becker D. Müller-Röber B. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). While the double mutant KST1-H160A/H271A completely lacks pH-dependent gating, a single mutation to arginine at position 271 even resulted in an inverted pH dependence. Because this histidine is highly conserved in plant K+ channels only, it was predicted that acid activation based on the pore histidine represents a plant-specific feature. To test this hypothesis we studied another guard cell Kin+ channel, KAT1, with respect to the structural basis for its acid activation. Histidine, aspartate, and glutamate mutants were generated in the plant K+ channel consensus sequence GYGDXH and electrophysiologically characterized in comparison to the wild type after expression in Xenopus oocytes. DISCUSSIONThe use of site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological characterization of the generated channel mutants enabled the identification of structural elements essential for the K+ selectivity, susceptibility toward blockers, voltage dependence, and pH regulation of plant K+ channels (1Hoth S.

In this study, we examined the molecular basis for acid activation of the two guard cell K+ uptake channel α-subunits KAT1 and KST1. The steady-state currents of both channels increase upon acidification of the extracellular solution. A comparable pH dependence was observed in another potato Kin+ channel, SKT1, and in the maize channel ZMK1, which both represent members of the AKT1 family (15Zimmermann S. Talke I. Ehrhardt T. Nast G. Müller-Röber B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 2K. Philippar, I. Fuchs, H. Lüthen, S. Hoth, C. Bauer, K. Haga, G. Thiel, G. Ljung, G. Sandberg, M. Böttger, D. Becker, and R. Hedrich, submitted for publication. Acid activation of KST1 and KAT1 is mediated by a shift of the half-maximal activation voltage to more positive voltages with decreasing extracellular pH (Fig. 1 B and Refs. 1Hoth S. Dreyer I. Dietrich P. Becker D. Müller-Röber B. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Hedrich R. Moran O. Conti F. Busch H. Becker D.

Plant J. 1995; 7: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This pH-dependent shift has been shown to depend on the only two extracellular histidine residues in KST1 (1Hoth S. Dreyer I. Dietrich P. Becker D. Müller-Röber B. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In view of the conservation of this pore histidine in all cloned Kin+ channels, we supposed a plant-specific pH-sensing structure. Because in KAT1 mutations of the corresponding histidine at position 267, H267A and H267R, did not affect the pH-dependent gating properties (Fig.1 C), the acid-induced voltage shift seems not just based on this histidine. Evidence for the existence of additional sites is further supported by our recent studies on the Arabidopsis thaliana K+ channel AKT3, which contains this pore histidine, too, but is blocked by protons. 3I. Marten, S. Hoth, R. Deeken, P. Ache, K. Ketchum, R. Hedrich, and T. Hoshi, submitted for publication. In contrast to all plant K+ uptake channels but in line with the animal Kin+ channels (30Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 31Sabirov R.Z. Okada Y. Oiki S. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in AKT3 extracellular protons reduce the single channel conductance rather than the voltage dependence.The K+ channel blocker TEA+ has been used successfully to localize amino acid residues of the outward rectifyingShaker K+ channel. Thereby MacKinnon and Yellen (32MacKinnon R. Yellen G. Science. 1990; 250: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) identified a threonine residue at position 449 inShaker mediating TEA+ blockade. This position corresponds to the position of the pore histidine in KAT1 and KST1. In blocking studies with extracellular TEA+, we could show that substitution of the histidine by alanine resulted in an almost TEA+-insensitive phenotype (Fig. 2). In homology to theShaker-type channels, the requirement of the histidine for the TEA+ block of KAT1 and KST1 indicates its localization in the outer pore of both guard cell channel proteins. The same conclusion has been drawn from Cs+ and TEA+inhibition experiments on the KAT1 double-mutant KAT1-H267T/E269V (33Ichida A.M. Schroeder J.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the elimination of the histidine residue might be sufficient to explain the reduced TEA+ sensitivity of this double mutant. Furthermore the identical selectivity of KST1 wild type and the channel mutant KST1-H271A 4S. Hoth and R. Hedrich, unpublished results. suggests that the constrained geometry of the selectivity filter (16Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5684) Google Scholar) is not affected by an adjacent single mutation.The KAT1 and KST1 α-subunits are expressed in guard cells and share the basic features of the in vivo characterized GCKC1in channels (guard cellK+channel 1,inward rectifying) from A. thaliana andSolanum tuberosum, respectively (4Brüggemann L. Dietrich P. Dreyer I. Hedrich R. Planta. 1998; 207: 370-376Google Scholar, 7Müller-Röber B. Busch H. Ellenberg J. Becker D. Provart N. Dietrich P. Willmitzer L. Hoth S. Hedrich R.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In contrast to the potato channels, the GCKC1 from A. thaliana have been shown to operate at more acidic pH values. This difference was also observed between KAT1 and KST1 when expressed in Xenopusoocytes (Fig. 1 B) and might point to the participation of acidic amino acids like aspartate or glutamate within the pH sensor of KAT1. The consequently generated aspartate mutant KAT1-D265N, however, revealed a proton block rather than an acid-induced shift in the voltage dependence (Fig. 3 B). Probably the same blocking mechanism underlies the inverted pH dependence of the KAT1 mutant Y263R in the GYGD consensus sequence (27Nakamura R.L. Anderson J.A. Gaber R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1011-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutations in the two pore glutamates of KAT1 either did not affect the pH sensitivity (KAT1-H267T/E269V; Ref. 33Ichida A.M. Schroeder J.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or did not produce functional K+ channels (KAT1-E273A or KAT1-E273R; data not shown). Thus, the importance of the aspartate at position 265 for pH sensing is unique with respect to carboxylate residues within the KAT1 pore. In KST1, however, in addition to the histidine we identified the pore aspartate as a key amino acid of the pH sensor. As described for the histidine mutant KST1-H271R (1Hoth S. Dreyer I. Dietrich P. Becker D. Müller-Röber B. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This difference was also observed between KAT1 and KST1 when expressed in Xenopusoocytes (Fig. 1 B) and might point to the participation of acidic amino acids like aspartate or glutamate within the pH sensor of KAT1. The consequently generated aspartate mutant KAT1-D265N, however, revealed a proton block rather than an acid-induced shift in the voltage dependence (Fig. 3 B). Probably the same blocking mechanism underlies the inverted pH dependence of the KAT1 mutant Y263R in the GYGD consensus sequence (27Nakamura R.L. Anderson J.A. Gaber R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1011-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutations in the two pore glutamates of KAT1 either did not affect the pH sensitivity (KAT1-H267T/E269V; Ref. 33Ichida A.M. Schroeder J.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or did not produce functional K+ channels (KAT1-E273A or KAT1-E273R; data not shown). Thus, the importance of the aspartate at position 265 for pH sensing is unique with respect to carboxylate residues within the KAT1 pore. In KST1, however, in addition to the histidine we identified the pore aspartate as a key amino acid of the pH sensor. As described for the histidine mutant KST1-H271R (1Hoth S. Dreyer I. Dietrich P. Becker D. Müller-Röber B. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the mutant channel KST1-D269N showed an inverted pH dependence with respect to the half-maximal activation voltage V 12 (Fig. 3 B). Because all described histidine and the aspartate mutants changed the gating properties of KST1 in a pH-dependent manner, a molecular link between the pH and the voltage sensor was anticipated. The arginine residue at position 181 in the S4 segment represents a candidate for this interaction, because the voltage-dependent mutant channel KST1-R181Q shifted by about 90 mV more positive and reversed its pH dependence. Studies on the topology of the KAT1 channel following expression inEscherichia coli show an interaction of amino acids in the transmembrane segments S3 and S4 like in animal channels (28Tiwari-Woodruff S.K.

Because the histidine at position 160 in the S3-S4 linker of KST1 is part of the pH sensor, an interaction between His160 and Arg181 might relate the voltage and pH sensor to each other. Because it is impossible, however, to judge from this one mutation in S4 whether this putative connection is of minor or major importance in coupling, further mutations are required to elucidate the complete structural link to the pH sensor. In conclusion, we could show that the proton-triggered shift in the voltage dependence of KAT1 and KST1 is based on distinct amino acids. Whereas in KST1 the histidine as well as the aspartate play a crucial role in pH sensing, both residues do not contribute to the pH-dependent gating in KAT1. In future experiments, chimera between plant K+ channels with altered pH phenotype will help to identify in detail the distinct pH-sensitive domains and key residues therein. We thank K.

The CREB CAD interacts with the general transcription factor TFIID through one or more of the TATA-binding protein-associated factors (TAFs), one of which is TAF110. The CAD is composed of three subdomains, rich in either serine, hydrophobic amino acids, or glutamine. In the present study, analysis of deletion mutants of the CAD showed that all three CAD subdomains were required for effective interaction with TAF110 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Therefore, a library of random point mutations within the CAD was analyzed in a reverse two-hybrid screen to identify amino acids that are essential for interaction with the TAF. Interaction defects resulted solely from mutations of hydrophobic amino acid residues within the hydrophobic cluster to charged amino acid residues. Together, the deletion and mutation analyses suggest that the entire CAD provides an environment for a specific hydrophobic interaction with TAF110 that is crucial for interaction.

Extracellular stimuli that activate protein kinases lead to phosphorylation of CREB on serine 133 by activated PKA, resulting in further enhancement of transcriptional activation (7Lee C.Q. Yun Y.D.

In addition, previous work showed that CREB contains two separate and independently acting transcriptional activation domains: a constitutive activation domain (CAD) responsible for basal activation and a kinase-inducible domain that mediates activation in response to cAMP-activated PKA (3Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16999-17009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Brindle P. Linke S. Montminy M. Nature. 1993; 364: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). When the CREB CAD is fused to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the yeast Gal4 protein, it activates basal transcription from a Gal4 promoter nearly as well as the complete unphosphorylated CREB (3Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16999-17009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Brindle P. Linke S. Montminy M. Nature. 1993; 364: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Activation by CREB kinase-inducible domain (KID) is proposed to be mediated by interaction with CREB-binding protein, which, in turn, interacts with polymerase complex components (12Parker D. Ferreri K. Nakajima T. LaMorte V.J. Evans R. Koerber S.C. Hoeger C. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 13Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The CAD is composed of three subdomains with distinct amino acid compositions; a serine/threonine rich region (ST3), a hydrophobic cluster (HC), and a glutamine-rich region (Q3). Deletion of any of these regions results in a substantial loss of basal activation by the CAD (14Xing L.P. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28732-28736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear whether these subdomains target a single factor or interact with different targets in the preinitiation complex (PIC). We also showed that the CREB CAD binds TFIID through interaction with one or more TAFs, rather than directly with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) (15Xing L.P. Gopal V. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17488-17493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Ferreriet al. (17Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) showed that dTAF110, the interaction of which with the glutamine-rich/hydrophobic domain of Sp1 had been extensively characterized (16Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), also interacts with CREB. Transcription of a protein-coding gene by RNA polymerase II requires the assembly of a large complex of factors around the transcriptional start site in the promoter of the gene. The characterization of these general transcription factors (GTFs) has been an ongoing, ambitious project in many laboratories and has lead to two basic models for basal transcriptional activation (18Conaway R. Conaway J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 19Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the first model, factors assemble in a stepwise fashion (TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIA, TFIIF-polII, TFIIE, and TFIIH) into a functional PIC with the ultimate goal of positioning the polymerase complex at the proper start site and allowing synthesis of an mRNA transcript to begin (20Van Dyke M.W. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The specific order of addition in this model is based on in vitro transcription assays and template binding assays with purified GTFs (18Conaway R. Conaway J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 21Weil P.A. Luse D.S. Segall J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1979; 18: 469-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 22Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A.

A second model is based on recent in vivo work that suggests that the majority of the GTFs, except TFIID (and perhaps TFIIB), exist in the cell as large preformed complexes termed holoenzymes (19Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and that holoenzymes may be recruiteden bloc to the promoter (24Bjorklund S. Kim Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 335-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Many activators have been shown to interact directly with one or more of the GTFs, and this interaction is currently thought to be a major mechanism for gene activation. Importantly, for either the stepwise addition or holoenzyme models, TFIID is proposed to be an obligatory first step in PIC formation. TFIID consists of the TBP and a large group of TBP-associated factors or TAFs, ranging in size from 15 to 250 kDa, which are generally well conserved from yeast to mammals (26Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 27Tanese N. Pugh B. Tjian R.

In vitrotranscription experiments have demonstrated that many activators will function only if the complete TFIID complex is added and cannot activate transcription if TBP alone is included (29Pugh B. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 30Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Cellular TBP is required for transcription by all three RNA polymerases, and it is partitioned in vivo among multiprotein complexes for each polymerase, including TFIID (28Zhou Q. Lieberman P.M. Boeyer T.G. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 31Pugh B.F. Tjian R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 679-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many diverse transcriptional activators have been shown to interact with the TAF subunits of TFIID, including Sp1 (32Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and bicoid (33Sauer F. Wassarman D. Rubin G. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1271-1284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with TAF110, estrogen receptor with TAF30 (34Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), CAAT transcription factor with TAF55 (35Sauer F. Hansen S.K. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 270: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), NF-κB with TAF105 (36Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), vitamin D receptor with hTAF130 (37Mengus G. May M. Carre L. Chambon P. Davidson I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1381-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), thyroid receptor with TAF110 (38Petty K.J. Krimkevich Y.I. Thomas D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1632-1645PubMed Google Scholar), and p53 with TAF40 and TAF60 (39Thut C.J. Chen J. Klemm R. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 267: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In the case of CREB, the CAD alone bound to an enhancer upstream of the transcriptional start site activates transcription and the CAD interacts with TFIID (3Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16999-17009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Xing L.P. Gopal V. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17488-17493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because binding of TFIID must precede the association of other general transcription factors with the promoter, activators such as the CAD in CREB are thought to enhance transcription initiation by facilitating the binding of the TFIID complex. This general mechanism for gene activation has been suggested for many activators (41Carey M. Cell. 1998; 92: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to map the region(s) of the CAD involved in protein-protein interaction with TAF110 and ultimately determine the amino acid residues of the CAD that make crucial contacts with the TAF. A yeast two-hybrid assay was used to determine which subdomains of the CAD are required to support interaction with TAF110. In addition, the CAD was subjected to random point mutagenesis and the mutated CAD library was screened in a reverse two-hybrid system to identify amino acids of the CREB CAD that are crucial for interaction with this TAF. The same yeast expression vectors were used in the two-hybrid and reverse two-hybrid experiments. One, pGAD-110, contains the coding region for the N-terminal 308 amino acids of the TAF110 protein fused to the activation domain of the yeast Gal4 protein (amino acids 768–881) (42Chein C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). This plasmid carries theLEU2 selectable marker gene and the amp rgene. A second yeast expression plasmid, pGN-1 (43Schena M. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), was modified to contain the coding regions for CREB, the CREB CAD, or the various deletion mutations and point mutations of the CAD fused to the Gal4 (DBD amino acids 4–94). This plasmid carries the TRP1selectable marker, as well as the amp r gene. The yeast strain Y-153 (gal4−, leu−, trp−, Gal:LacZ, etc.) is that described by the S. Elledge laboratory (44Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P. Yeh S. Yang Y. Kilburu A. Lee W. Elledge S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The MaV203 yeast strain is a derivative of Y-153 and was described by Vidal et al. (45Vidal M. Brachmann R. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Boeke J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This strain is ura3− and contains the URA3 gene under control of a promoter that is kept silent by a sporulation repressor element unless induced by binding of activator to the Gal4 containing upstream activation sequence. A LiAc protocol was used to introduce plasmids into yeast (46Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The appropriate yeast strain was grown in 50 ml of YEPD (0.5% yeast extract, 1.0% peptone, 25 μg/ml adenine, 2% glucose) at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.2. Yeast were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed with TE and re-centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of LiAc solution (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 100 mm LiAc) and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with gentle shaking. Cells were centrifuged as above and resuspended in 2 ml of LiAc solution. 200 μl of these competent yeast cells was combined with 10 μg of each appropriate plasmid DNA and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. One ml of 50% PEG 3350 was added, followed by mixing and incubation at 30 °C for 1 h. Cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 5 min, pelleted, and washed with dH2O. Yeast were resuspended in 200 μl of dH2O and plated on the appropriate selective medium. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days to allow colony formation. A glass bead lysis method was used to make yeast protein lysates (47Shultz L.D. Hofmann K.J. Mylin L.M. Montgomery D.L. Ellis R.W. Hopper J.E. Gene. 1987; 61: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The yeast clone of interest was grown in 50 ml of double-selective liquid medium to anA 600 of approx. 0.8. Yeast were centrifuged at 5000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min in a JA17 rotor, and the pellet was resuspended in breaking buffer (50 mmNa2HPO4, 50 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) with protease inhibitors added (175 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm e-amino-n-caproic acid). The pellet was transferred to a 15-ml Corex tube on ice. Glass beads (0.5 mm) were added up to the fluid meniscus, and the slurry was vortexed eight times for 30 s with 2 min on ice between each round. The resulting crude yeast lysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble cellular debris and residual glass beads. A standard Bradford assay was used to estimate total protein concentration to ensure that comparable amounts of lysates were used in quantitative β-galactosidase assays and for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting experiments. To lift colonies for the qualitative filter assay, a Whatman filter paper circle was placed on the plate until wet. Yeast were lysed by placing the filter into liquid nitrogen for 1 min. The filter was placed in a Petri dish and incubated with 2 ml of Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 40 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% SDS) containing 20 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C until a blue color was evident. For the quantitative liquid assay (48Himmelfarb H.J. Pearlberg J. Last D.H. Ptashne M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1299-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), 2–5 mg of protein lysate was added to 1 ml of Z buffer and incubated with 200 μl of 4 mg/mlO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C until a yellow color was evident. After color development, 0.5 ml of 1 m Na2CO3 was added to stop the reaction, and the absorbance at 420 nm was determined spectrophotometrically. Values were adjusted for incubation time and protein concentration to give the specific activity of the sample. A relaxed stringency PCR protocol that promotes polymerase errors was adjusted to introduce ≤1 error per CAD sequence of 300 base pairs (49Zhou Y. Zhang X. Ebright R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGEM3Z-CAD94, containing the CREB CAD coding region, was used as a template for PCR with two primers that annealed to opposite strands on either side ofNcoI and ClaI restriction sites that remove the CAD from the plasmid. The PCR mixture contained 10 ng of template DNA, 5pmole of each primer, 10 mm of each dNTP, 4 mmMgSO4, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.4, and 5 units of Taq polymerase. Amplification of the CAD was carried out for 33 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting amplicon pool was digested withNcoI/ClaI, and the DNA fragments were subcloned into the pGN-CAD-G4 yeast expression vector in place of the wild type CAD NcoI/ClaI fragment. The resulting library was transformed into Escherichia coli and grown, and plasmid DNA for transformation of yeast was prepared by a standard CsCl method. The method described by Nasmyth and Reed (50Nasmyth K.M. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 77: 2119-2123Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar) was used for plasmid isolation from yeast. The yeast clone of interest was grown in 5 ml of single selective medium (without Trp, to select for only the CAD-G4 containing plasmid) to anA 600 of approximately 0.6. An aliquot of 1.5 ml of the culture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of S buffer (10 mmKPO4, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.2). Yeast cell walls were digested by adding 5 μl of 20 mg/ml zymolase and incubating at 37 °C for 60 min. Lysis buffer (0.1 ml) (0.25 m Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm EDTA, 2.5% SDS) was added, and the sample was vortexed and incubated at 65 °C for 30 min. After precipitation with 166 μl of 3 m KOAc (pH 5.8) on ice for 10 min, samples were centrifuged, and nucleic acid was precipitated from the supernatant with 0.8 ml of EtOH. The pellet was washed, dried, and resuspended in 40 μl of dH2O. An aliquot of 2 μl of this preparation was used to transform E. coli by electroporation. Clones were screened for the proper plasmid construct and sequenced. We first established a functional yeast two-hybrid assay to test mutants for interaction (51Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). CREB contains two independent activation domains, kinase-inducible domain (KID) and CAD, that were defined by functional analysis of CREB-Gal4 (CRG) fusion proteins (Fig. 1 A) (3Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16999-17009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CAD can be further subdivided into three subdomains, based on sequences required for activation and prevalent amino acid composition: ST3, HC, and Q3 (14Xing L.P. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28732-28736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on previous reports of interaction between TAF110 and SP-1 or CREB (16Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 17Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), we used two yeast expression plasmids, one in which the N-terminal 308 amino acids of TAF110 are fused to the Gal4 activation domain and that carries a selectable marker (Trp), and a second expression plasmid carrying a different selectable marker (Leu) and expressing the CREB activation domain-Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins (CRG, CAD-G4, etc.). These plasmids were co-transformed into the yeast strain Y-153 (leu−, trp−, gal4−), which contains thelacZ gene under control of a Gal4 responsive promoter (44Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P. Yeh S. Yang Y. Kilburu A. Lee W. Elledge S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Activation of this hybrid gene, as a result of interaction between the two fusion proteins, leads to the production of β-galactosidase, which can be measured by qualitative and quantitative assays. The extent of this interaction can be qualitatively determined by using the synthetic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl b-d-galactopyranoside in a filter lift assay to give a blue color to those colonies expressing β-galactosidase (data not shown). In addition, a quantitative β-galactosidase assay of yeast extracts was used to determine the relative strength of the interactions, which is directly proportional to the amount of β-galactosidase activity (β-galactosidase activity/mg of protein) (Fig.1 B). Neither of the test plasmids, CRG or TAF-AD, had any activity alone, but significant β-galactosidase activity was observed when full-length CAD-G4 was cotransformed with a TAF110-AD expression construct (Fig. 1 B). This response indicates that CAD-G4 recruited TAF110-AD to the upstream activation sequence-lacZ gene promoter, resulting in activation of thelacZ gene. The specificity of this interaction, together with the lack of activity of CREB in yeast, provides a useful model for determining interactions between various CAD mutants and TAF110. The results in Fig. 1 B show that the interaction of TAF110 with CREB maps to the CREB CAD. Previous work in our laboratory showed that constitutive activity in vivorequired all three subdomains of the CAD, which may interact with one or more different targets in the polymerase complex (14Xing L.P. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28732-28736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several different TAFs in TFIID have been shown to interact with transcriptional activators. Thus, we were interested in determining whether a specific subdomain in the CAD would mediate the interaction with TAF110 or whether all three subdomains were required. We first tested CADs deleted of each of the three subdomains, ST3, HC, and Q3, for interaction with TAF110 in an attempt to identify a smaller region of interaction, with the ultimate goal of mapping the amino acid residues involved. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce restriction sites flanking each region in question so that it could be deleted. Each mutant was tested for interaction with TAF110 and compared with the activity obtained with the full-length CAD (Fig.2). Deletion of any of the three CAD subdomains reduced the interaction with TAF110, as compared with full-length CAD. In fact, ΔHC and ΔQ3 showed little, if any, activity. However, ΔST3 did retain approximately 35% of full-length CAD activity, so we further truncated the remaining region to see whether a discreet interaction target for TAF110 might reside within the HC/Q3 region. We deleted the N-terminal half of HC (ΔNHC), the C-terminal half of Q3 (ΔCQ3), and both (ΔNHC/ΔCQ3). When these mutants were tested for interaction with TAF110, a gradual loss of activity was observed for successive truncation of the HC/Q3 region of the CAD (Fig. 2). The results of these yeast two-hybrid experiments lead to the conclusion that elements throughout the entire CAD are necessary for interaction with TAF110, either for a conducive conformation or through direct amino acid contacts with the TAF. To determine the amino acid residues of CAD involved in the interaction with TAF110, the CAD was subjected to random point mutagenesis, and the resulting library was screened in a reverse two-hybrid assay for interaction-deficient mutants. The lack of a specific region within CAD responsible for TAF110 interaction led to the decision to use the entire 87-amino acid CAD for point mutagenesis. We employed a PCR-based mutagenesis protocol to introduce random point mutations into the CAD coding region. This approach exploits the high error rate of the native Taq polymerase and can be fine-tuned by altering the Mg2+ concentration and cycle number to introduce mutations into a given template at a desired rate (49Zhou Y. Zhang X. Ebright R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PCR primers that flank the CAD coding sequence were chosen (Fig.3 A), and the region was amplified under conditions designed to introduce, on average, one base change error for each 300 base pairs synthesized (see under “Experimental Procedures” for exact conditions used). DNA sequencing of clones from the mutagenized pool confirmed the expected error rate. The resulting mutagenized amplicon pool was then digested with restriction enzymes with recognition sites flanking the CAD coding sequence and the DNA fragments were subcloned into the yeast expression vector as a fusion with a wild type Gal4 DBD (Fig. 3 A). To screen the library for interaction-deficient CAD mutants, we employed a reverse two-hybrid method (45Vidal M. Brachmann R. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Boeke J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). This method uses a yeast strain (MaV203, a derivative of the Y-153 used above) that contains a URA3 gene under control of a Gal4 promoter in addition to the GAL4-lacZ reporter gene. Addition of the drug 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) is toxic to yeast when the URA3 gene product is expressed. Therefore, in a two-hybrid assay in the presence of 5-FOA, cells containing CAD-G4 that interacts with TAF-AD will activate Gal4-URA3, resulting in cell death. Those clones with an interaction-defective CAD-G4 will survive 5-FOA treatment. Double selective medium ensures the presence of both expression plasmids. Preliminary experiments showed that the cytotoxicity of 5-FOA was specific, because yeast containing the wild type CAD-DBD, and TAF110-AD expression vectors or an expression plasmid for full-length Gal4 showed normal growth without 5-FOA but no growth with 0.025% 5-FOA added (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, clones containing DBD plus TAF110-AD, or CAD-DBD plus empty-AD, or both empty vectors are able to grow normally in the absence or presence of 5-FOA. These preliminary results established"

In brain, NO is synthesized mainly by nNOS1 (4Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar), which is expressed in various brain regions including the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and several hypothalamic nuclei (5Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). One of the nNOS-positive nuclei in the hypothalamus is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (6Reuss S. Decker K. Rosseler L. Layes E. Schollmayer A. Spessert R. Brain Res. 1995; 695: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which has a circadian oscillator to create circadian rhythms in hormonal secretions, enzyme activities, and behaviors. The SCN also controls energy metabolism through the regulation of the autonomic nervous system (7Nagai K. Nagai N. Shimizu K. Cun S. Nakagawa H. Niijima A. Prog. Brain Res. 1996; 111: 253-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown thatN G-methylarginine, an inhibitor of NOS, disturbs the circadian rhythm of drinking behavior in rats, suggesting that NO is involved in the generation and/or synchronization of the circadian rhythm (8Masutani H. Nagai K. Nakagawa H. Biol. Rhythm Res. 1994; 25: 433-441Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar).nNOS is one of three known isoforms of nitric-oxide synthase. Although nNOS does not have a transmembrane domain, subcellular fractionation experiments showed that ∼60% of the total NOS activity in brain was found in the particulate fraction, suggesting that nNOS is associated with membranes by interacting with some other membrane proteins (9Hecker M. Mulsch A. Busse R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of nNOS is unique to this isoform, having a PDZ motif, which is found in various structural proteins (10Cho K.-O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). This domain of nNOS is reported to interact with PDZ motifs in PSD (postsynaptic density)-95 and PSD-93 (11Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H.

Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, nNOS is targeted to sarcolemmal membranes by association with another PDZ-containing protein, α1-syntrophin, through PDZ-PDZ interactions (11Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). The syntrophins are a multigene family of proteins including α1, β1, and β2 isoforms, each of which has one PDZ domain and three pleckstrin domains (13Adams M.E. Butler M.H. Dwyer T.M. Peters M.F. Murnane A.A. Froehner S.C. Neuron. 1993; 11: 531-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In mammalian skeletal muscle, syntrophins are components of the dystrophin complex at sarcolemmal membranes, and are thought to function as adaptors that recruit signaling proteins to the membranes (14Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). α1-Syntrophin is also expressed in brain (15Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, the interaction of nNOS with α1-syntrophin in brain has not been precisely investigated yet.To examine whether the PDZ domain of nNOS interacts with proteins other than PSD-95 in brain, we purified nNOS-interacting proteins from bovine brain lysate. In this report, we show that one of the nNOS-interacting proteins in brain is α1-syntrophin. We also investigated the localization of nNOS and α1-syntrophin in primary cultured neurons from rat brain and in neurons from the hypothalamus to gain insight into the physiological functions of nNOS and nNOS-associated proteins in the central regulation of metabolism.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have purified an nNOS-binding protein from bovine brain and identified it as α1-syntrophin. We further demonstrated that nNOS- and α1-syntrophin-like immunoreactive substances showed similar subcellular distribution in primary cultures from fetal rat brain. Finally, the two proteins were expressed at relatively high levels and colocalized in the PVN and SCN in hypothalamic sections of adult rat brains. These results suggest that nNOS interacts with α1-syntrophin in specific neurons in brain.nNOS was originally found in mammalian brain, but was later shown to be present also in skeletal muscle, lung epithelial cells, and certain endocrine glands (12Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 19Schmidt H.H. Gagne G.D. Nakane M. Pollock J.S. Miller M.F. Murad F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1439-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, nNOS is localized at the sarcolemmal membranes by association with syntrophins, a component of the dystrophin complex (11Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 20Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The dystrophin complex is a membrane cytoskeletal structure that links the sarcolemmal membranes to extracellular matrix proteins and intracellular actin fibers. In brain, on the other hand, nNOS has been shown to be associated with PSD-95 and PSD-93 (11Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar), which are localized at the synapses as a component of the postsynaptic density structures (10Cho K.-O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). But the distribution of nNOS is found not only in the synapses, but also in the entire surfaces of cell bodies and neurites in several types of neurons such as those in the PVN of the hypothalamus (5Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that there are different mechanisms that define the intracellular localization of nNOS depending on cell types.Our present data showed that α1-syntrophin was associated with nNOSin vitro even in the presence of strong detergents such as Nonidet P-40, deoxycholate, and SDS. The binding affinity of nNOS for α1-syntrophin seemed to be much higher than that for PSD-95 as estimated by pull-down assay. In addition, nNOS and α1-syntrophin were colocalized in cell bodies, neuronal processes, and synapses in cultured neurons from fetal rat brains. These two proteins were also colocalized in neuronal cells in the SCN and PVN. From these results, we propose that α1-syntrophin also contributes to determining the subcellular localization of nNOS in certain regions of the brain.α1-Syntrophin was expressed in most regions in adult rat brain judging from Western blotting with anti-α1-syntrophin antibody. The present immunohistochemical data showed that the level of α1-syntrophin was relatively high in several neurons, including the PVN and SCN in the hypothalamus (Fig. 7). These two nuclei have been known to contain nNOS. These results support the possibility that nNOS and α1-syntrophin interact with each other in certain brain regions and imply that they have functional relationships. The immunohistochemical distribution of α1-syntrophin is not completely consistent with its mRNA distribution previously shown by in situ hybridization (21Gorecki D.C. Abdulrazzak H. Lukasiuk K. Barnard E.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 965-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the discrepancy might be elicited by the stability of mRNA and protein.In skeletal muscle, syntrophins have been shown to be a component of the dystrophin complex and to function as molecular adaptors that recruit signaling proteins to the membrane (14Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Dystrophin is also present in brain and has been reported to localize at postsynaptic densities (22Lidov H.G. Byers T.J. Watkins S.C. Kunkel L.M. Nature. 1990; 348: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, nNOS is unlikely to interact with dystrophin in brain because nNOS is membrane-associated even in the brains ofmdx mice that lack dystrophin (20Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Rather, nNOS might be associated with membrane proteins such as other dystrophin family proteins via α1-syntrophin.The SCN and PVN have key roles in the regulation of metabolism and behavior through controlling the autonomic nervous system and endocrine functions in mammals. The PVN regulates various neuroendocrine hormones through the hypothalamohypophysial system, and NO has been suggested to be implicated in its function (23Zhang K. Mayhan W.G. Patel K.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R864-R872PubMed Google Scholar). The SCN is the nucleus containing the circadian oscillator responsible for circadian rhythms (24Rusak B. Zucker I. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 449-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar) and a mechanism controlling the autonomic nervous system (7Nagai K. Nagai N. Shimizu K. Cun S. Nakagawa H. Niijima A. Prog. Brain Res. 1996; 111: 253-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that infusion ofN G-methylarginine into the third ventricle in rats disrupts the circadian rhythm of drinking behavior (8Masutani H. Nagai K. Nakagawa H. Biol. Rhythm Res. 1994; 25: 433-441Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), suggesting that NO might be involved in the generation and/or synchronization of the circadian oscillator. nNOS- and α1-syntrophin-like immunoreactive substances were detected at relatively high levels in the dorsomedial region of the SCN, where vasopressin-containing neurons exist, and it was shown that these vasopressin neurons are involved in the regulation of secretion of adrenal glucocorticoid (25Kalsbeek A. Buijs R.M. Brain Res. 1992; 580: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be interesting to examine the coexistence of nNOS and α1-syntrophin with vasopressin in the SCN to obtain further information on the physiological functions of nNOS and α1-syntrophin in the SCN. Nitric oxide is a major endogenous mediator involved in many physiological and pathological functions such as vasodilation, neurotransmission, and cytotoxicity (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl.

In this report, we show that one of the nNOS-interacting proteins in brain is α1-syntrophin. We also investigated the localization of nNOS and α1-syntrophin in primary cultured neurons from rat brain and in neurons from the hypothalamus to gain insight into the physiological functions of nNOS and nNOS-associated proteins in the central regulation of metabolism. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have purified an nNOS-binding protein from bovine brain and identified it as α1-syntrophin. We further demonstrated that nNOS- and α1-syntrophin-like immunoreactive substances showed similar subcellular distribution in primary cultures from fetal rat brain. Finally, the two proteins were expressed at relatively high levels and colocalized in the PVN and SCN in hypothalamic sections of adult rat brains. These results suggest that nNOS interacts with α1-syntrophin in specific neurons in brain.nNOS was originally found in mammalian brain, but was later shown to be present also in skeletal muscle, lung epithelial cells, and certain endocrine glands (12Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 19Schmidt H.H. Gagne G.D. Nakane M. Pollock J.S. Miller M.F. Murad F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1439-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, nNOS is localized at the sarcolemmal membranes by association with syntrophins, a component of the dystrophin complex (11Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E.

Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The dystrophin complex is a membrane cytoskeletal structure that links the sarcolemmal membranes to extracellular matrix proteins and intracellular actin fibers. In brain, on the other hand, nNOS has been shown to be associated with PSD-95 and PSD-93 (11Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S.

Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). But the distribution of nNOS is found not only in the synapses, but also in the entire surfaces of cell bodies and neurites in several types of neurons such as those in the PVN of the hypothalamus (5Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that there are different mechanisms that define the intracellular localization of nNOS depending on cell types.Our present data showed that α1-syntrophin was associated with nNOSin vitro even in the presence of strong detergents such as Nonidet P-40, deoxycholate, and SDS. The binding affinity of nNOS for α1-syntrophin seemed to be much higher than that for PSD-95 as estimated by pull-down assay. In addition, nNOS and α1-syntrophin were colocalized in cell bodies, neuronal processes, and synapses in cultured neurons from fetal rat brains. These two proteins were also colocalized in neuronal cells in the SCN and PVN. From these results, we propose that α1-syntrophin also contributes to determining the subcellular localization of nNOS in certain regions of the brain.α1-Syntrophin was expressed in most regions in adult rat brain judging from Western blotting with anti-α1-syntrophin antibody. The present immunohistochemical data showed that the level of α1-syntrophin was relatively high in several neurons, including the PVN and SCN in the hypothalamus (Fig. 7). These two nuclei have been known to contain nNOS. These results support the possibility that nNOS and α1-syntrophin interact with each other in certain brain regions and imply that they have functional relationships. The immunohistochemical distribution of α1-syntrophin is not completely consistent with its mRNA distribution previously shown by in situ hybridization (21Gorecki D.C. Abdulrazzak H. Lukasiuk K. Barnard E.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 965-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the discrepancy might be elicited by the stability of mRNA and protein.In skeletal muscle, syntrophins have been shown to be a component of the dystrophin complex and to function as molecular adaptors that recruit signaling proteins to the membrane (14Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Dystrophin is also present in brain and has been reported to localize at postsynaptic densities (22Lidov H.G. Byers T.J. Watkins S.C. Kunkel L.M. Nature. 1990; 348: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, nNOS is unlikely to interact with dystrophin in brain because nNOS is membrane-associated even in the brains ofmdx mice that lack dystrophin (20Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Xia H. Aldape K. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Rather, nNOS might be associated with membrane proteins such as other dystrophin family proteins via α1-syntrophin.The SCN and PVN have key roles in the regulation of metabolism and behavior through controlling the autonomic nervous system and endocrine functions in mammals. The PVN regulates various neuroendocrine hormones through the hypothalamohypophysial system, and NO has been suggested to be implicated in its function (23Zhang K. Mayhan W.G. Patel K.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R864-R872PubMed Google Scholar). The SCN is the nucleus containing the circadian oscillator responsible for circadian rhythms (24Rusak B. Zucker I. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 449-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar) and a mechanism controlling the autonomic nervous system (7Nagai K. Nagai N. Shimizu K. Cun S. Nakagawa H. Niijima A. Prog. Brain Res. 1996; 111: 253-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that infusion ofN G-methylarginine into the third ventricle in rats disrupts the circadian rhythm of drinking behavior (8Masutani H. Nagai K. Nakagawa H. Biol. Rhythm Res. 1994; 25: 433-441Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), suggesting that NO might be involved in the generation and/or synchronization of the circadian oscillator. nNOS- and α1-syntrophin-like immunoreactive substances were detected at relatively high levels in the dorsomedial region of the SCN, where vasopressin-containing neurons exist, and it was shown that these vasopressin neurons are involved in the regulation of secretion of adrenal glucocorticoid (25Kalsbeek A. Buijs R.M. Brain Res. 1992; 580: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be interesting to examine the coexistence of nNOS and α1-syntrophin with vasopressin in the SCN to obtain further information on the physiological functions of nNOS and α1-syntrophin in the SCN. In this study, we have purified an nNOS-binding protein from bovine brain and identified it as α1-syntrophin.

https://openalex.org/W2015347860,"The recently described Hmx family of homeodomain proteins is predominately expressed in discrete regions of developing sensory tissues. In this report, we have identified the preferred DNA-binding site of the murine Hmx3 homeodomain protein by the selection and amplification binding (SAAB) technique. The consensus Hmx-binding site contained the sequence 5′-CAAGTG-3′, which differs from the 5′-TAAT-3′ motif commonly associated with homeodomain proteins. Instead, the Hmx consensus is similar to the 5′-CAAGTG-3′-binding sites of Nkx2.1 and Nkx2.5 homeodomain proteins. Based on mutation studies, both the 5′-CAAG-3′ core and the 3′-TG dinucleotide are required for high affinity binding by Hmx3 and the homologous Hmx1 protein. A critical determinant of this specificity is the glutamine at position 50 in the third helix of the Hmx homeodomain. Hmx1 binds to the 5′-CAAGTG-3′ element with an apparent dissociation constant of 20 nm. Unexpectedly, the human Hmx1 protein specifically repressed transcription from a luciferase reporter gene containing 3 copies of the 5′-CAAGTG-3′ sequence. In contrast, the Nkx2.5 protein transactivated this luciferase reporter. Interestingly, co-expression of Hmx1 and Nkx2.5 attenuated each others activity, suggesting that genes containing the CAAGTG element can integrate signals from these proteins. Therefore, Hmx1 and Nkx2.5 proteins bind a unique DNA sequence and act as transcriptional antagonists.

A novel homeodomain gene family, Hmx, was first identified by Stadler et al. (8Stadler H.S. Padanilam B.J. Beutow K. Murray J.C. Solursh M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11579-11583Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using low stringency screening of a human craniofacial cDNA library. Homologous Hmx genes have now been identified in a diverse number of species (9Stadler H.S. Murray J.C. Leysens N.J. Goodfellow P.J. Solursh M. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There are three closely related members of the Hmx family in humans and mice, which are designated Hmx1, Hmx2, and Hmx3 (8Stadler H.S. Padanilam B.J. Beutow K. Murray J.C. Solursh M. Proc. Natl.

The murine Hmx2 and Hmx3 genes were origi-nally namedNkx5.2 and Nkx5.1, respectively, based on limited homology with the Nk homeodomain family ofDrosophila (10Bober E. Baum C. Braun T. Arnold H. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 288-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Kim Y. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7716-7720Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, the Hmx family is substantially different from the Nk family (9Stadler H.S. Murray J.C. Leysens N.J. Goodfellow P.J. Solursh M. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Alignment of the Hmx3 homeodomain protein sequence to the four DrosophilaNk genes yielded 50–61% amino acid sequence identity, which is not substantially greater than seen when Hmx3 is compared with other homeodomains, such as Drosophila Antp (47%). Furthermore, aDrosophila Hmx homologue has been identified and found to have 94% amino acid identity with the murine Hmx3 homeodomain (9Stadler H.S. Murray J.C. Leysens N.J. Goodfellow P.J. Solursh M. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Finally, there is little or no homology between the Nkx and Hmx proteins outside the homeodomains. Hence, we have used theHmx nomenclature for these genes, as assigned by the human gene mapping nomenclature committee (9Stadler H.S. Murray J.C. Leysens N.J. Goodfellow P.J. Solursh M. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Hmx genes are believed to be important regulators of development in sensory organs and neurons based on their expression patterns in the embryo (10Bober E. Baum C. Braun T. Arnold H. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 288-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Rinkwitz-Brandt S.R. Justus M. Oldenettel I. Arnold H.H. Bober E. Mech. Dev. 1995; 52: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The expression of murineHmx3 is especially high in the otic vesicle, neuroectodermal cells of the central nervous system, neuronal derivatives of the neural crest, including the dorsal root ganglia and myenteric ganglia, and transiently in the second branchial arch. In particular, the predominant expression in the otic vesicle and postmitotic neurons has suggested an involvement in the development of the inner ear and specification of neuronal phenotype (13Hadrys T. Braun T. Rinkwitz-Brandt S. Arnold H. Bober E. Development. 1998; 125: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar). The murine Hmxgenes have very similar expression patterns with two chicken homologues, GH6 and SOHo-1 gene (14Stadler H.S. Solursh M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Deitcher D.L. Fekete D.M. Cepko C.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 486-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the Hmx genes play an evolutionary conserved role during development. The chicken homologue of Hmx1 (GH6) has been reported to be expressed in the developing heart (14Stadler H.S. Solursh M. Dev.

In particular, Nkx2.5 and chicken Hmx1 are both expressed in the developing heart myocardium (12Rinkwitz-Brandt S.R. Justus M. Oldenettel I. Arnold H.H. Bober E. Mech.

Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that Hmx and Nkx2.5 proteins both regulate early transcription events in development. To begin to address the functional role of Hmx homeodomain proteins, we have identified the DNA-binding site of the Hmx1 and -3 proteins. We show that these Hmx proteins prefer the core binding sequence 5′-CAAG-3′ and not the typical 5′-TAAT-3′ core found among most homeodomain proteins (1Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzel G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 25-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 2McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, 3Kornberg T.B.

Instead, the Hmx-binding site resembles the consensus site found for Nkx2.5 protein (also called Tinman) by Chen and Schwartz (20Chen C. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and Nkx2.1 protein (also called thyroid transcription factor-1) by Damante et al. (21Damante G. Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Civitareale D. Guazzi S. Schwartz M. Cauci S. Quadrifoglio F. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Hmx1 represses transcription of a luciferase reporter gene containing the Hmx preferred DNA-binding site. Since Nkx2.5 transactivates this reporter and the Nkx2.5 and Hmx proteins are co-expressed in some tissues, we propose that Hmx1 and Nkx2.5 may act as transcriptional antagonists. A fragment of the murine Hmx3 gene was PCR2 amplified from a genomic clone provided by Dr. Tom Lufkin (Mt. Sinai Medical Center). The primers were nucleotides 1232 to 1252 (5′-ggatccCCGGGCTCAGAGGACTGGAAG-3′) and nucleotides 1675 to 1695 (5′-gaattcCCTGTCCCATCTCACACCGGC-3′), with BamHI andEcoRI sites (lowercase) to facilitate subcloning into pGEX4T-3 glutathione S-transferase (GST) vector (Pharmacia) and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid, pGST-Hmx3, encodes amino acids 309–458, which contains the homeodomain 20 amino-terminal flanking residues, and the entire COOH-terminal region. To make plasmid pGST-Hmx3 Gln → Lys, an antisense primer containing the point mutation (underlined), nucleotides 1423–1448, (5′-GGCGATTCTTGAACCAGATCTTGACC-3′) was used with the previous 5′ primer (nucleotides 1232–1252) to make a PCR megaprimer. In the second PCR step the megaprimer was used with the previous 3′ primer (nucleotides 1675–1695). The PCR profile was 94 °C, 2 min; 70 °C, 2 min, 72 °C, 3.5 min for 30 cycles using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Hmx3 Gln → Lys DNA was cloned into pGEX4T-3 and confirmed by sequencing. Plasmid pGST-Hmx1 was made by a series of sequential subcloning of the Hmx1 coding region from pBSK II Hmx1 cDNA plasmid (9Stadler H.S. Murray J.C. Leysens N.J. Goodfellow P.J. Solursh M. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) into pGEX 6P-1 (Pharmacia). The plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli JT4000 5-IV95, alon− protease-deficient strain, or BL21 cells. Protein was isolated as described (22Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Cultures (500 ml) were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. The bacteria were lysed in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% low fat dry milk, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, on ice for 15 min, followed by addition of 1.5% Sarkosyl and sonication for 1 min. In later experiments, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was used and 4% Triton was added prior to sonication. After removal of debris, the supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of a 1:1 (v/v) slurry of glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C, then washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Hmx3 was released by cleavage with 10 units of thrombin (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min. Hmx1 was released by cleavage with 30 units of PreScission protease (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4 °C. All proteins were analyzed following SDS-gel electrophoresis by silver stain. In some experiments, GST-Hmx3 and GST-Hmx3 Gln → Lys were eluted using 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, for 5 min at room temperature. For Western blots, the proteins were resolved by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore), immunoblotted, and detected using ECL reagents from Amersham. The antibody directed against Hmx3 (number 19902; used at 1/1000 dilution) was raised in rabbits to a MAP-conjugated peptide in the COOH-terminal region (IVRVPILYHENSAAEGAAAA) (Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, AL). In some experiments, immunoblots were also done using a GST antibody (used at 1/2000 dilution) (Pharmacia) (data not shown). SAABs were done essentially as described by Blackwell and Weintraub (23Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), using affinity chromatography (24Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostani N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The “random” oligonucleotide contained 20 random nucleotides flanked by known sequences “b” and “a” that could be recognized by PCR primer b (5′-AGACGGATCCATTGCA-3′) and PCR primer a (5′-TCCGAATTCCTACAG-3′), respectively (sequences from Ref. 23Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Double-stranded random oligonucleotides were generated by annealing primer a (0.7 μg) to single-stranded random oligonucleotide (1.5 μg), then filled using Klenow polymerase, with tracer amounts of [32P]dATP to facilitate quantitation. The double-stranded oligonucleotide (500 ng) and GST-Hmx3 (500 ng) attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated in 10 volumes of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) with 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were concentrated and washed twice with binding buffer, then resuspended in 30 μl of H2O. A 10-μl aliquot was then PCR amplified in a 25-μl reaction for 30 cycles of 94 °C (1.5 min), 40 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (2 min). For subsequent rounds, 10 μl (approximately 50 ng) of the PCR reactions was incubated with 50 ng of protein. Products from the last round were gel purified, cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced on one strand using an SP6 primer. Complementary oligonucleotides containing a consensus Nkx2.1 site (see Fig.1 C) (21Damante G. Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Civitareale D. Guazzi S. Schwartz M. Cauci S. Quadrifoglio F. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or a Bicoid site (5′-TAATCC-3′), with flanking partial BamHI ends were annealed and filled with Klenow polymerase to generate a 32P-labeled probe for EMSAs, as described (25Tverberg L.A. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15965-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For standard binding assays, the oligonucleotide (1 pmol) was incubated in a 20-μl reaction containing binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 120 ng of Hmx3 (thrombin-cleaved from GST or glutathione-eluted), or 300 ng of Hmx1 (PreScission cleaved) on ice for 15 min. For competition assays, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were preincubated with the protein for 15 min on ice prior to addition of the probe. Sequences of the Nkx2.1 probe and competitor oligonucleotides, all with flanking partial BamHI ends (in lowercase), are given in the figures, with the exception of Hmx Mu3, 5′-gatccCGGACCCCCAGTGGGAGCATCTggatc-3′ and Hmx Mu11, 5′-gattccTTGTTAATAATCTAATTACCCTAGggatc-3′. The samples were electrophoresed for 2 h at 250 V in an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE (22.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 28 mm boric acid, 0.7 mm EDTA) at 4 °C following pre-electrophoresis of the gels for 1 h at 200 V. The dried gels were visualized by exposure to autoradiographic film. For quantitative analyses to establish binding constants and relative competitions, the amount of bound and free radioactive probe was measured from dried gels using an InstantImager (Packard). The binding constants were calculated by Scatchard plots. For determination of the amount of binding competition, the ratio of bound to free probe was normalized to the absence of competitor DNA, which was set at 100%. An expression plasmid containing the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter linked to a human Hmx1EcoRI-BamHI fragment was constructed in pcDNA 3.1 MycHisC (Invitrogen). Dr. Yutzey, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, kindly provided the murine Nkx 2.5 expression plasmid (pEMSV-Nkx2.5). The Hmx-TK-luc reporter plasmid has Hmx-binding sites (same oligonucleotides as used in the EMSAs (5′-gatccCACTGCCCAGTCAAGTGTTCGGATg-3′ annealed to 5′-gatccATCCGAACACTTGACTGGGCAGTGg-3′)) ligated into theBamHI site upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in the TK-luc plasmid (25Tverberg L.A. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15965-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hmx-TK-luc contains three inserts, 2 in the sense and 1 in the antisense orientation. A CMV β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (CLONTECH) was co-transfected in all experiments as a control for transfection efficiency. COS-7 and HeLa cells were cultured and transfected as described (26Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B. Semina E. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20066-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) by a modification of the calcium phosphate method or electroporation. For calcium phosphate transfection, 5–10 μg of plasmid DNA was used. For electroporation, HeLa cells were mixed with 2.5 μg (or as indicated) of expression plasmids, 2.5 μg of reporter plasmid, and 0.5 μg of CMV β-galactosidase plasmid. HeLa cells were electroporated at 220 mV and 960 microfarads (Bio-Rad) plated in 60-mm culture dishes and fed with 5% fetal calf serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were then lysed and assayed for reporter activities and protein content by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase was measured using reagents from Promega. β-Galactosidase was measured using the Galacto-Light Plus reagents (Tropix Inc.). To determine the DNA-binding site of Hmx3, the SAAB technique was used with bacterial expressed GST-Hmx3 protein containing the homeodomain and COOH-terminal region. Previous studies with other homeodomain proteins have shown that the information necessary for DNA binding is contained within the homeodomain region (3Kornberg T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26813-26816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wuthrich K. Cell. 1994; 78: 211-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). For example, a truncated homeodomain-containing Nkx2.1 protein binds with the same apparentK D as the full-length protein (21Damante G. Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Civitareale D. Guazzi S. Schwartz M. Cauci S. Quadrifoglio F. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The sequences of oligonucleotides selected after 2, 3, and 5 sequential SAAB rounds are shown in Fig. 1 A. As early as rounds 2 and 3, a consensus containing 5′-CAA(T/G)-3′ was observed. Following the fifth round, there was a selection for oligonucleotides containing the consensus sequence 5′-CAAGTGCGTG-3′. In many cases, multiple copies of this sequence were found in the oligonucleotides. Each of the nucleotides within the consensus was highly conserved, with frequencies ranging from 75 to 100% occurrence (Fig. 1 B). In particular, the 5′-CAAG-3′ core was very predominant, being present in all of the selected oligonucleotides. These results indicate a strong preference for this consensus sequence. Because the Hmx and Nkx2.1 and 2.5 consensus elements both contain a 5′-CAAGTG-3′ motif, but the flanking sequences differed, we tested whether Hmx3 could also bind the Nkx2.1 element. Using a competitive EMSA DNA binding assay, we showed that the Hmx3 protein bound to DNA containing the Nkx2.1/2.5 consensus site and was efficiently competed by either the Nkx2.1/2.5 or the Hmx consensus motifs (Fig. 1 C). Thus, Hmx3 binds both Nkx2.1/2.5 and Hmx consensus binding sites without preference for flanking sequences. As a control for binding specificity, Hmx3 binding to the 5′-CAAGTG-3′ consensus sequence was not competed by an oligonucleotide containing an octamer consensus site recognized by the Oct-1 POU homeodomain. It should be noted that the 5′-CAAGTG-3′ consensus site for Hmx and Nkx proteins also contains a consensus helix-loop-helix protein-binding site (5′-CANNTG-3′) (27Davis R.L. Cheng P.-F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). While it was very unlikely that Hmx3 DNA binding activity was similar to helix-loop-helix proteins, we ruled out this formal possibility by demonstrating that Hmx3 did not bind to oligonucleotides containing two other 5′-CANNTG-3′ motifs. Both the 5′-CAGCTG-3′ and 5′-CACCTG-3′ elements recognized by the AP4 and muscle creatine kinase helix-loop-helix proteins, respectively, did not bind Hmx3 (data not shown). Thus, Hmx3 specifically binds the Hmx and Nkx2.1/2.5 motifs with comparable affinities. The binding of Hmx3 to the CAAG core was compared with the canonical TAAT sequence found in the Antennapedia class of homeodomains (28Hayashi S. Scott M.P. Cell. 1990; 63: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Hmx3 binding to the competitor was greatly reduced when the 5′-CAAG-3′ sequence was mutated to a typical homeodomain-binding site that matches the Msx consensus binding site, 5′-TAATTG-3′ (Msx) (Fig.2 A) (28Hayashi S. Scott M.P. Cell. 1990; 63: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). An even greater effect was seen when the competitor binding site was mutated at both the core and flanking dinucleotide 5′-TAATCA-3′ (Mu10) (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, mutation to 5′-TAATTA-3′ (Hmx Mu11), which matches a consensus Idx-binding site (29Miller C.P. McGehee R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), greatly reduced Hmx3 binding to the competitor (data not shown). Finally, complete removal of the CAAG core (Hmx Mu3) completely eliminated binding to the competitor (Fig.2 B). These results demonstrated that the 5′-CAAG-3′ core is critical for Hmx3 binding activity. The relative difference between Msx (TAATTG) and Hmx Mu10 (TAATCA) competitions indicated that the 3′-TG dinucleotide contributes to Hmx3 binding. This contribution was confirmed by the reduced Hmx3 binding to the competitor seen upon mutation of the TG in the context of the 5′-CAAG-3′ core sequence (Hmx Mu2, CAAGGT) (Fig.2 A). To further test the importance of the TG dinucleotide in the absence of the 5′-CAAG-3′ core, the TG was mutated to a GG (Ftz) or AT (Hmx Mu9) following a 5′-TAAT-3′ core. Hmx3 did not bind either of these DNAs in competition assays (Fig. 2 A). Quantitation of the effect of each competitor on Hmx3 binding is shown in Fig. 2 B. We also confirmed that sequences outside the 5′-CAAG-3′ and flanking TG dinucleotide motif are not required for Hmx3 binding. This was important to test since the SAAB consensus had contained an additional four nucleotides (CGTG) downstream of the CAAGTG motif. Changes in these nucleotides (Hmx Mu4) did not noticeably affect Hmx3 binding activity within the parameters of the competition assay (10–50-fold molar excess) (Fig. 2 A). This is consistent with Hmx3 binding to the Nkx2.1/2.5 consensus sequence, which also lacks the 3′-CGTG (Fig. 1 C). Taken together these results show that both the 5′-CAAG-3′ and the 3′-TG dinucleotide are the key components of the DNA-binding site. It has been shown that the 3′-dinucleotide of the DNA-binding site can confer binding specificity that is determined by the amino acid at position 50 of the classical TAAT binding homeodomain proteins (4Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wuthrich K.

Formisano S. Di Lauro R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the glutamine at position 50 is important for recognition of the TG dinucleotide in the Nkx2.1 consensus DNA-binding site, 5′-CAAGTG-3′. Hmx3 also contains this glutamine in the highly conserved third helix, suggesting that this residue may play a similar role in Hmx3. We made the corresponding mutation in Hmx3 changing the glutamine (Q) to a lysine (K). The glutamine to lysine mutation decreased binding to undetectable levels (Fig.3 A). As a control, the mutant protein could bind to a bicoid element (5′-TAATCC-3′) (Fig.3 B). The lysine at position 50 is important for recognition of the CC dinucleotide in the bicoid element (4Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wuthrich K. Cell. 1994; 78: 211-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 31Driever W. Nusslein-Volhard C. Nature. 1989; 337: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). GST-Hmx3 Gln → Lys mutant protein binding to the bicoid probe was competed by the bicoid competitor DNA but not by Hmx DNA. For comparison, the wild type Hmx3 protein bound very poorly to the bicoid probe and was effectively competed by the Hmx element (Fig. 3 B). Expression of the GST-Hmx3 Gln → Lys protein in bacteria was confirmed by Western blots with an antibody raised against a COOH-terminal peptide conserved in the Hmx family (Fig. 3 C). Varying concentrations of both GST-Hmx3 and GST-Hmx3 Gln → Lys proteins were analyzed for binding to the 5′-CAAGTG-3′ sequence. Thus, Hmx3 binding to the 5′-CAAGTG-3′ motif requires the glutamine at position 50 of the homeodomain. To determine if the binding characteristics of the homologous human Hmx1 protein were similar to Hmx3 we used a competitive EMSA DNA binding assay as described above. Hmx1 was chosen so as to extend our findings to another member of the Hmx family. Human Hmx1 has 92% amino acid identity to murine Hmx3 in the homeodomain. We demonstrate that the Hmx1 protein bound to DNA containing the Nkx2.1/2.5 site and was efficiently competed by the Nkx and Hmx consensus elements, but not other motifs (Fig.4 A). Hmx1 had the same DNA binding specificity as shown for the truncated Hmx3 protein (Fig.4 B). The binding affinity of Hmx1 to the 5′-CAAGTG-3′ sequence was measured by EMSA (Fig. 4 C). The apparent dissociation constant (K D) was calculated using different protein and probe concentrations by Scatchard analysis as 20 nm (Fig.4 C). This K D is higher than those reported for Nkx2.1 (3 nm), Antennapedia (1.2 nm), and Engrailed (1–2 nm) (4Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D.

In LT-α knock-out mice, the development of lymphoid organs is prevented (7De Togni P. Goellner J. Ruddle N.H. Streeter P.R. Fick A. Mariathasan S. Smith S.C. Carlson R. Shornick L.P.

Studies involving LT-β knock-out mice have shown impairment of lymph node development and loss of splenic architecture (8Koni P.A. Sacca R. Lawton P. Browning J.L. Ruddle N.H. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1997; 6: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed when the soluble LT-β receptor-immunoglobulin Fc chimera fusion protein was introduced into the embryonic circulation by injecting pregnant mice (9Rennert P.D. Browning J.L. Mebius R. Mackay F. Hochman P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1999-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Direct evidence to demonstrate the role of LT-βR in lymphoid organ development comes from the fact that LT-βR deficient mice lack Peyer's patches, colon-associated lymphoid tissues, and all lymph nodes (10Futterer A. Mink K. Luz A. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Pfeffer K. Immunity. 1998; 9: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Moreover, injection of the agonist anti-LT-βR monoclonal antibody into the uteri of pregnant LT-α knock-out mice has been shown to result in the genesis of lymph nodes in their progeny (11Rennert P.D.

In addition to its role in lymphoid organ development, stimulation of LT-βR on certain cell lines by LT-α1/β2 or anti-LT-βR antibodies can induce cell death (12Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I.

Thus, LT-βR may also have important biological functions in the mature individuals.The cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR, like other members of the TNF receptor family, does not contain consensus sequences characteristic of enzymatic activity. Therefore, signaling is thought to be mediated by the proteins interacting with LT-βR. Two serine/threonine protein kinases, p50 and p80, have been shown to associate with LT-βR(CD) specifically (15Wu M.Y. Hsu T.L. Lin W.W. Campbell R.D. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol.

Moreover, two members of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family, TRAF3 and TRAF5, were found to associate with LT-βR (16VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G.

On the other hand, several members of TNFR superfamily (such as TNFRI, Fas, DR3, DR4, and DR5) contain a common motif, the death domain, in their cytoplasmic region (19Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M.

Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). LT-βR(CD) does not contain a death domain, but signaling through LT-βR can also induce apoptosis (12Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to map the region of LT-βR responsible for its cytotoxic effect and to determine whether LT-βR mediates apoptosis via the activation of caspase cascades.Both TNFRI and TNFRII can induce cell death when bound by TNF. It has also been reported that clustering of TNF receptors due to interaction either with trivalent TNF or with an agonist antibody is a crucial step for subsequent intracellular signaling (32Engelmann H. Holtmann H. Brakebusch C. Avni Y.S. Sarov I. Nophar Y. Hadas E. Leitner O. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Espevik T. Brockhaus M. Loetscher H. Nonstad U. Shalaby R. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because the cytoplasmic domain of TNFRI can self-associate through its death domain (34Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22492-22495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), overexpression of TNFRI or of its cytoplasmic domain alone can also induce receptor clustering resulting in the activation of downstream signaling pathways (34Boldin M.P.

Haegeman G. Fiers W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1627-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, TNFRII has no death domain and shows no tendency to self-associate, nor does a high level of TNFRII expression result in spontaneous signaling (34Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E.

Heller R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that LT-βR(CD) is capable of self-association, despite the absence of a death domain. Moreover, overexpression of LT-βR or LT-βR(CD) was sufficient to trigger apoptosis without the need for ligand conjugation. The cytotoxic effect mediated by LT-βR(CD) relies on the presence of its self-association domain, suggesting that this domain is critical in the LT-βR signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONThe cytoplasmic domains of TNFRI and Fas have been shown to be able to self-associate via their death domains. This self-association can prompt signaling events, giving rise to TNF and Fas effects (34Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

In contrast, the cytoplasmic region of TNFRII has no death domain and shows no tendency to self-associate, nor does overexpression of this receptor induce cell death (34Boldin M.P. Mett I.L.

Natarajan K. Heller R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar). Like TNFRII, LT-βR does not contain a death domain. However, studies using the yeast two-hybrid and GST-pull down systems have clearly demonstrated the self-association tendency of LT-βR(CD) (Ref. 39Chen C.M. You L.R. Hwang L.H. Lee Y.H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9417-9426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and the present report). In addition, we have observed that overexpression of LT-βR or LT-βR(CD) is sufficient to trigger apoptosis, without the need to cross-link LT-βR with ligand or an agonist antibody. It has been shown that a dominant negative mutant of TRAF3, TRAF3(367–568), can inhibit apoptosis induced by LT-α1/β2 or anti-LT-βR antibodies (16VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Likewise, our results showed the dominant negative effect of TRAF3(367–568) on LT-βR(CD)-induced apoptosis. This result suggests that apoptotic signaling mediated by LT-βR(CD) may share the same pathway as that triggered by ligand conjugation. Furthermore, activation of NF-κB was also observed in cells overexpressing LT-βR(CD). 2M.-Y. Wu, P.-Y. Wang, and S.-L. Hsieh, unpublished data. This is in accordance with previous reports that stimulation of LT-βR by recombinant LT-α1/β2 or anti-LT-βR antibodies can transduce signals not only for apoptosis (12Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) but also for NF-κB activation (14Mackay F. Majeau G.R. Hochman P.S. Browning J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24934-24938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on the observations above, overexpression of LT-βR(CD) seems to be able to activate downstream signaling events equivalent to those induced by LT-α1/β2 or anti-LT-βR antibodies.It has been shown that apoptotic signaling mediated by TNFRI or Fas occurs via interaction with other death domain-containing proteins, which can initiate caspase cascades to execute apoptosis (31Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that LT-βR(CD)-induced apoptosis was inhibited by several caspase inhibitors: CrmA, Z-VAD-FMK, and DEVD-FMK, suggesting that the activation of CPP32 or ICE-related caspases might be involved in the apoptotic signaling of LT-βR. Because LT-βR does not contain a death domain, it will be intriguing to discover how LT-βR initiates the caspase pathway. This question might be answered by examining whether TRAF3 or other LT-βR(CD)-associated proteins could recruit and activate caspase(s).LT-α1/β2 or anti-LT-βR antibodies cannot trigger apoptosis without the presence of IFN-γ (12Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, LT-βR(CD)-induced apoptosis does not require the presence of IFN-γ, nor did IFN-γ result in a synergistic enhancement of LT-βR(CD) cytotoxicity (data not shown). The mechanism of IFN-γ action in apoptosis induced by LT-βR is still unclear. Recently, IFN-γ was found to modulate cell death by inducing several apoptosis-related genes, including the TNFR family members, TNFRI and Fas; a bcl-2 family member, bak; and the caspase family members, ICE, CPP32, and FLICE (40Ossina N.K. Cannas A. Powers V.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Knight J.D. Gilbert J.R. Shekhtman E.M. Tomei L.D. Umansky S.R. Kiefer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16351-16357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, IFN-γ does not up-regulate LT-βR expression on HT-29 (12Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and HeLa (data not shown) cell lines. It is possible that IFN-γ might modulate LT-βR-induced cell death by regulating caspases involved in the cytotoxic effect. However, the amounts of LT-βR(CD) expressed by transfected cells might be sufficient to initiate caspase cascades to execute apoptosis, such that IFN-γ does not further enhance the cytotoxic effect. This speculation is supported by the fact that LT-βR(CD)-induced apoptosis can be inhibited by several caspase inhibitors, suggesting that the activation of caspases is important in this apoptotic pathway.Because there are no consensus sequences for membrane anchorage in the FLAG tag or LT-βR(CD), the FLAG-LT-βR(CD) fusion protein would be expected to express as a cytoplasmic protein. However, the FLAG-LT-βR(CD) was shown to be localized in the proximity of plasma membrane. Interestingly, we also observed that membrane juxtaposition of LT-βR(CD) and its deletion mutants correlates with their ability to self-associate and to induce apoptosis. Because the self-association domain is required for targeting of LT-βR(CD) to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6), we speculate that membrane juxtaposition of LT-βR(CD) might be due to its association with endogenous LT-βR (Fig. 1), which may therefore induce receptor clustering to activate apoptotic signaling. Nevertheless, our result does not rule out the possibility that LT-βR(CD) can be linked to the membrane by other proteins, either located on the inner side of cell membrane or associated with endogenous LT-βR.Previous studies have shown that the death domain of TNFRI has a strong tendency to self-associate and interact with other death domain-containing proteins and plays an obligatory role in signaling cell death. In the present report, self-association of LT-βR(CD) was mapped to amino acids 324–377, a region that is also required for apoptotic signaling. Interestingly, the self-association domain (amino acids 324–377) is the same region as that required for the interactions between LT-βR and its associated kinases, p50 and p80 (15Wu M.Y. Hsu T.L. Lin W.W. Campbell R.D. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, the self-association domain of LT-βR almost overlaps with a region of LT-βR, which has been shown to interact with the core antigen of hepatitis C virus (39Chen C.M. You L.R. Hwang L.H. Lee Y.H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9417-9426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.Y. Ou J.H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the self-association domain of LT-βR does not show significant sequence similarity with the death domains of TNFRI and Fas; therefore, the self-association domain of LT-βR represents a novel motif that is essential for receptor self-association, as well as interaction with both cytoplasmic and viral proteins, and that might regulate the receptor signaling for cell death. The identification of proteins capable of interacting with amino acids 324–377 of LT-βR will be crucial to understand LT-βR signaling. Lymphotoxin-β receptor (LT-βR)1 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily and is expressed on the surface of most of cell types, including cells of epithelial and myeloid lineages but not on T and B lymphocytes (1Ware C.F.

Invest. 1998; 102: 1142-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). LT-βR has been speculated to play an essential role in the development of lymphoid organs. In LT-α knock-out mice, the development of lymphoid organs is prevented (7De Togni P. Goellner J. Ruddle N.H. Streeter P.R. Fick A. Mariathasan S. Smith S.C. Carlson R. Shornick L.P. Strauss-Schoenberger J. Russell J.H. Karr R. Chaplin D.D. Science. 1994; 264: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Studies involving LT-β knock-out mice have shown impairment of lymph node development and loss of splenic architecture (8Koni P.A. Sacca R. Lawton P. Browning J.L. Ruddle N.H. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1997; 6: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed when the soluble LT-β receptor-immunoglobulin Fc chimera fusion protein was introduced into the embryonic circulation by injecting pregnant mice (9Rennert P.D. Browning J.L. Mebius R. Mackay F. Hochman P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1999-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Direct evidence to demonstrate the role of LT-βR in lymphoid organ development comes from the fact that LT-βR deficient mice lack Peyer's patches, colon-associated lymphoid tissues, and all lymph nodes (10Futterer A. Mink K. Luz A. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Pfeffer K. Immunity. 1998; 9: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Moreover, injection of the agonist anti-LT-βR monoclonal antibody into the uteri of pregnant LT-α knock-out mice has been shown to result in the genesis of lymph nodes in their progeny (11Rennert P.D. James D. Mackay F. Browning J.L. Hochman P.S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in lymphoid organ development, stimulation of LT-βR on certain cell lines by LT-α1/β2 or anti-LT-βR antibodies can induce cell death (12Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), chemokine secretion (13Degli-Esposti M.A. Davis-Smith T. Din W.S. Smolak P.J. Goodwin R.G. Smith C.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1756-1762PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (14Mackay F. Majeau G.R. Hochman P.S. Browning J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24934-24938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, LT-βR may also have important biological functions in the mature individuals. The cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR, like other members of the TNF receptor family, does not contain consensus sequences characteristic of enzymatic activity. Therefore, signaling is thought to be mediated by the proteins interacting with LT-βR. Two serine/threonine protein kinases, p50 and p80, have been shown to associate with LT-βR(CD) specifically (15Wu M.Y. Hsu T.L. Lin W.W. Campbell R.D. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but the function of p50 and p80 in the LT-βR signaling pathway is still the subject of intensive study. Moreover, two members of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family, TRAF3 and TRAF5, were found to associate with LT-βR (16VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G.

Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). LT-βR(CD) does not contain a death domain, but signaling through LT-βR can also induce apoptosis (12Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to map the region of LT-βR responsible for its cytotoxic effect and to determine whether LT-βR mediates apoptosis via the activation of caspase cascades. Both TNFRI and TNFRII can induce cell death when bound by TNF. It has also been reported that clustering of TNF receptors due to interaction either with trivalent TNF or with an agonist antibody is a crucial step for subsequent intracellular signaling (32Engelmann H. Holtmann H. Brakebusch C. Avni Y.S. Sarov I. Nophar Y. Hadas E. Leitner O. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Espevik T. Brockhaus M. Loetscher H. Nonstad U. Shalaby R. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because the cytoplasmic domain of TNFRI can self-associate through its death domain (34Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Haegeman G. Fiers W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1627-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, TNFRII has no death domain and shows no tendency to self-associate, nor does a high level of TNFRII expression result in spontaneous signaling (34Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E.

Heller R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that LT-βR(CD) is capable of self-association, despite the absence of a death domain. Moreover, overexpression of LT-βR or LT-βR(CD) was sufficient to trigger apoptosis without the need for ligand conjugation. The cytotoxic effect mediated by LT-βR(CD) relies on the presence of its self-association domain, suggesting that this domain is critical in the LT-βR signaling pathway. DISCUSSIONThe cytoplasmic domains of TNFRI and Fas have been shown to be able to self-associate via their death domains. This self-association can prompt signaling events, giving rise to TNF and Fas effects (34Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

In contrast, the cytoplasmic region of TNFRII has no death domain and shows no tendency to self-associate, nor does overexpression of this receptor induce cell death (34Boldin M.P. Mett I.L.

Natarajan K. Heller R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar). Like TNFRII, LT-βR does not contain a death domain. However, studies using the yeast two-hybrid and GST-pull down systems have clearly demonstrated the self-association tendency of LT-βR(CD) (Ref. 39Chen C.M. You L.R. Hwang L.H. Lee Y.H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9417-9426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and the present report). In addition, we have observed that overexpression of LT-βR or LT-βR(CD) is sufficient to trigger apoptosis, without the need to cross-link LT-βR with ligand or an agonist antibody. It has been shown that a dominant negative mutant of TRAF3, TRAF3(367–568), can inhibit apoptosis induced by LT-α1/β2 or anti-LT-βR antibodies (16VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Likewise, our results showed the dominant negative effect of TRAF3(367–568) on LT-βR(CD)-induced apoptosis. This result suggests that apoptotic signaling mediated by LT-βR(CD) may share the same pathway as that triggered by ligand conjugation. Furthermore, activation of NF-κB was also observed in cells overexpressing LT-βR(CD). 2M.-Y. Wu, P.-Y. Wang, and S.-L. Hsieh, unpublished data. This is in accordance with previous reports that stimulation of LT-βR by recombinant LT-α1/β2 or anti-LT-βR antibodies can transduce signals not only for apoptosis (12Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) but also for NF-κB activation (14Mackay F. Majeau G.R. Hochman P.S. Browning J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24934-24938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Based on the observations above, overexpression of LT-βR(CD) seems to be able to activate downstream signaling events equivalent to those induced by LT-α1/β2 or anti-LT-βR antibodies.It has been shown that apoptotic signaling mediated by TNFRI or Fas occurs via interaction with other death domain-containing proteins, which can initiate caspase cascades to execute apoptosis (31Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that LT-βR(CD)-induced apoptosis was inhibited by several caspase inhibitors: CrmA, Z-VAD-FMK, and DEVD-FMK, suggesting that the activation of CPP32 or ICE-related caspases might be involved in the apoptotic signaling of LT-βR. Because LT-βR does not contain a death domain, it will be intriguing to discover how LT-βR initiates the caspase pathway. This question might be answered by examining whether TRAF3 or other LT-βR(CD)-associated proteins could recruit and activate caspase(s).LT-α1/β2 or anti-LT-βR antibodies cannot trigger apoptosis without the presence of IFN-γ (12Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, LT-βR(CD)-induced apoptosis does not require the presence of IFN-γ, nor did IFN-γ result in a synergistic enhancement of LT-βR(CD) cytotoxicity (data not shown). The mechanism of IFN-γ action in apoptosis induced by LT-βR is still unclear. Recently, IFN-γ was found to modulate cell death by inducing several apoptosis-related genes, including the TNFR family members, TNFRI and Fas; a bcl-2 family member, bak; and the caspase family members, ICE, CPP32, and FLICE (40Ossina N.K. Cannas A. Powers V.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Knight J.D. Gilbert J.R. Shekhtman E.M. Tomei L.D. Umansky S.R. Kiefer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16351-16357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, IFN-γ does not up-regulate LT-βR expression on HT-29 (12Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and HeLa (data not shown) cell lines. It is possible that IFN-γ might modulate LT-βR-induced cell death by regulating caspases involved in the cytotoxic effect. However, the amounts of LT-βR(CD) expressed by transfected cells might be sufficient to initiate caspase cascades to execute apoptosis, such that IFN-γ does not further enhance the cytotoxic effect. This speculation is supported by the fact that LT-βR(CD)-induced apoptosis can be inhibited by several caspase inhibitors, suggesting that the activation of caspases is important in this apoptotic pathway.Because there are no consensus sequences for membrane anchorage in the FLAG tag or LT-βR(CD), the FLAG-LT-βR(CD) fusion protein would be expected to express as a cytoplasmic protein. However, the FLAG-LT-βR(CD) was shown to be localized in the proximity of plasma membrane. Interestingly, we also observed that membrane juxtaposition of LT-βR(CD) and its deletion mutants correlates with their ability to self-associate and to induce apoptosis. Because the self-association domain is required for targeting of LT-βR(CD) to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6), we speculate that membrane juxtaposition of LT-βR(CD) might be due to its association with endogenous LT-βR (Fig. 1), which may therefore induce receptor clustering to activate apoptotic signaling. Nevertheless, our result does not rule out the possibility that LT-βR(CD) can be linked to the membrane by other proteins, either located on the inner side of cell membrane or associated with endogenous LT-βR.Previous studies have shown that the death domain of TNFRI has a strong tendency to self-associate and interact with other death domain-containing proteins and plays an obligatory role in signaling cell death. In the present report, self-association of LT-βR(CD) was mapped to amino acids 324–377, a region that is also required for apoptotic signaling. Interestingly, the self-association domain (amino acids 324–377) is the same region as that required for the interactions between LT-βR and its associated kinases, p50 and p80 (15Wu M.Y. Hsu T.L. Lin W.W. Campbell R.D. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, the self-association domain of LT-βR almost overlaps with a region of LT-βR, which has been shown to interact with the core antigen of hepatitis C virus (39Chen C.M. You L.R. Hwang L.H. Lee Y.H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9417-9426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Matsumoto M. Hsieh T.Y. Zhu N. VanArsdale T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.Y. Ou J.H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the self-association domain of LT-βR does not show significant sequence similarity with the death domains of TNFRI and Fas; therefore, the self-association domain of LT-βR represents a novel motif that is essential for receptor self-association, as well as interaction with both cytoplasmic and viral proteins, and that might regulate the receptor signaling for cell death. The identification of proteins capable of interacting with amino acids 324–377 of LT-βR will be crucial to understand LT-βR signaling. The cytoplasmic domains of TNFRI and Fas have been shown to be able to self-associate via their death domains. This self-association can prompt signaling events, giving rise to TNF and Fas effects (34Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

To ascertain if the phenotype, impaired secretion of factor H, is due to the C518R substitution or the C941Y substitution and to ascertain the mechanism by which secretion is impaired, we studied COS-1 and HepG2 cells transfected with wild type and several mutant factor H molecules.

In each case, mutant factor H was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded relatively slowly as compared with most other mutant secretory and membrane proteins that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Patients with homozygous factor H deficiency develop recurrent bacterial infections (includingNesseria sp.), vasculitis, and/or glomerulonephritis. The molecular basis for factor H deficiency has so far only been investigated in one patient, a child with glomerulonephritis (1Ault B.H. Schmidt B.Z. Fowler N.L. Kashtan C.E. Ahmed A.E. Vogt B.A. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25168-25175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In skin fibroblasts from this patient there is an impairment in secretion of the large, 155-kDa form of factor H, while the small, 45-kDa form of factor H is secreted normally. The mutant factor H is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of these cells. Analysis of the factor H cDNA sequence in the patient revealed single nucleotide substitutions on each allele: C518R substitution that affects the residue in the Cys2 position of SCR 9 on one allele and a C941Y substitution changing the Cys2 position of SCR 16 on the other allele. These mutations affect SCR units that are not present in the small form of factor H, thereby providing an explanation for impaired secretion of the large but not the small form. In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate several specific mutant factor H molecules. The fate of these mutants was examined in transfected COS-1 and HepG2 cells to determine whether impaired secretion in factor H deficiency is caused by either the C518R substitution or the C941Y substitution or both and whether the mechanism by which these mutants are retained in the ER involves the specific amino acid substitutions or disruption of the associated disulfide bond. A normal human liver cDNA library in Lambda Zap II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) provided by Dr. Rick Wetsel (24Haviland D.L. Haviland J.C. Fleischer D.T. Hunt A. Wetsel R.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 362-368PubMed Google Scholar) was screened with a 1.4 kilobase pair cDNA probe (H-19, provided by Dr. Dennis Hourcade, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), which spans the nucleotide sequence from the first half of SCR 1 to the end of SCR 7 (25Schulz T.F. Schwable W. Stanley K.K. Wei E. Dierich M.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A full-length clone (HL-2) was isolated and sequenced. Five mutants were constructed using the overlap polymerase chain reaction strategy (26Horton R.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotide pairs were used for mutagenesis: for mutant C518R TCATAGTCTAGAGTGTCATTCAGCTTAAACCA and CACTCTAGACTATGAACGCCATGATGGTTATGAA; for mutant C518A TCATAGTCTAGAGTGTCATTCAGCTTAAACCA and CACTCTAGACTATGAAGCCCATGATGGTTATGAAAGC; for mutant C546R TATGGGTAGATCTGACCAACCATTGTAACC and GTCAGATCTACCCATACGTTATGAAAGAGAATGCGAA; for mutant C546A TATGGGTAGATCTGACCAACCATTGTAACC and GTCAGATCTACCCATAGCTTATGAAAGAGAATGCGAA; for C518A-C546A TATGGGTAGATCTGACCAACCATTGTAACC and GTCAGATCTACCCATAGCTTATGAAAGAGAATGCGAA (missense mutations are underlined, and silent mutations introducingXbaI or BglII restriction enzyme sites are in boldface type). Oligonucleotides AACATCAGGATCAATTAGATGTGGGAAAGAT and CCTTATGTTAGAATTATGATCGAATTCCTT were used as flanking primers and for the second round amplifications of each mutant. Polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into HL-2 using BbrPI andBfrI restriction sites. For expression studies, the wild type and mutant factor H cDNA constructs were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA I/Amp (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). One mutant, the C941Y mutant, was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using as template RNA from the patient with factor H deficiency (1Ault B.H. Schmidt B.Z. Fowler N.L.

The resulting clone spanned the sequence from SCR 7 to the 3′-untranslated region and carried the C941Y mutation in SCR 16. A fragment carrying G2949A mutation was ligated into the expression vector containing the wild type factor H sequence using StuI and NcoI restriction sites. Each mutant was subjected to DNA sequence analysis on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide method. A skin fibroblast cell line from the factor H-deficient patient was described previously (1Ault B.H. Schmidt B.Z. Fowler N.L. Kashtan C.E. Ahmed A.E. Vogt B.A. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25168-25175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Normal primary adult human fibroblasts (GM8399), HepG2 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line), and COS-1 cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were obtained from the human genetic repository (NIGMS, National Institutes of Health, Camden, NJ). All cell lines were maintained in growth medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Fibroblasts were not used after passage 12. Cells were plated in growth medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) in six-well tissue culture plates (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) the day before biosynthetic labeling. HepG2 cells were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-1 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (27Ausubel F.M Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 16.13.1-16.13.3Google Scholar) and were replated in six-well plates on the first day post-transfection. Fibroblasts or transfected cells were washed twice with warm Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for the pulse period in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine (Life Technologies) containingl-glutamine, HEPES, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% dialyzed FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT) and supplemented with 250–500 μCi/ml of TRAN35S (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA; specific activity of 1199 Ci/mmol). At the end of the pulse period, the labeling medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with warm Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated in growth medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin. At timed intervals, the medium was removed, and the cell monolayer was washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and lysed by one freeze-thaw cycle in lysis buffer, PBS containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (Fisher), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma), 10 mm EDTA (Sigma), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim). Cell lysates and media were clarified by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min). The incorporation of radioactive amino acids into newly synthesized proteins was measured by trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) precipitation. Precleared samples were immunoprecipitated with excess goat antibody to human factor H (INCSTAR, Stillwater, MN). Sheep anti-human factor H serum (Binding Site, San Diego, CA) was used for immunoprecipitation from HepG2 cells. Immunocomplexes were collected with an excess of Immunoprecipitin (Life Technologies), suspended in immunoprecipitation wash solution, PBS, 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, containing 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V; ICN Radiochemicals), washed as described by Kulics et al. (28Kulics J. Circolo A. Strunk R.C. Colten H.R. Immunology. 1994; 82: 509-515PubMed Google Scholar), and then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis in a 6 or 7% acrylamide gel under reducing conditions (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.49-18.59Google Scholar). After Immunoprecipitin became unavailable, a preparation of protein G bearing group C Streptococcus sp. cells (Sigma) was used. Gels were subjected to fluorography on Kodak MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C. For some pulse-chase experiments, gels were exposed to a phosphor screen, and the images were quantified using the STORM system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunoprecipitated material was incubated overnight at 37 °C in 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5; Sigma), 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V; ICN Radiochemicals) in the presence or absence of 0.1 unit/ml endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H ofStreptomyces plicatus (Sigma; EC 3.2.1.96). For the complete removal of N-linked oligosaccharides, immunoprecipitated material was incubated overnight at 37 °C in PBS, 10 mm EDTA, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V; ICN Radiochemicals), 10 units/ml N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim; EC 3.2.218). Transfected COS-1 cells were plated in growth medium on coverslips in 24-well plates 2 days after transfection. The coverslips were incubated overnight at 37 °C and then rinsed with PBS and fixed for 2 h at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Coverslips were blocked with 50 mmNH4Cl in PBS, and the cells were permeabilized with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 7 min, rinsed with PBSc (PBS containing 0.50 mm CaCl2 and 0.25 mm MgCl2), and blocked for 1 h at 4 °C with antibody diluting solution (PBSc containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem) and 0.01% Tween 80 (Pierce)). The coverslips were then incubated overnight at 4°C with goat anti-human factor H IgG (INCSTAR, Stillwater, MN) and then washed four times with PBSc 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma). After blocking, coverslips were incubated for 2 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (Binding Site) and then washed four times and mounted on microscope slides in Mowiol (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) containing 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2] octane (Sigma) (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 418Google Scholar). Slides were examined and photographed in a Zeiss Axioscope epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). For the colocalization studies, goat anti-human factor H and rabbit antibody to the amino terminus of the ER protein calnexin (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) were used. Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used as second label. For labeling the Golgi apparatus, Texas Red-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used at 2.5 μg/ml (31Tartakoff A.M. Vassali P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Confocal images were taken using a × 63 immersion oil objective on a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC laser confocal microscope adaptor. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software (version 4.0, Adobe, San Jose, CA). Nonimmune IgG and nonimmune serum were used in the first step of staining as controls and were found to not be significantly different from the unstained background. There was no fluorescence emission for fluorescein isothiocyanate at the filter setting for Texas Red andvice versa. Several clones identified during screening of a normal human liver cDNA library were analyzed. Clone HL-2 contained the full-length factor H cDNA (3957 base pairs). The 5′-end of HL-2 is base 13 of the published factor H cDNA sequence, and the 3′ end of HL-2 extends 43 bases beyond the published sequence (Ref. 8Ripoche J. Day A.J. Harris T.J.R. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar; GenBankTMentry HSH.GB_PR, accession number Y00716). Sequence analysis demonstrated that HL-2 was identical to the published factor H cDNA sequence except for four nucleotide substitutions. One, A2089G, does not result in a change in the derived amino acid sequence (CAA and CAG both encode Gln654). Two differences, C1277T and G2881T, result in amino acid substitutions that represent previously characterized polymorphic variants (H384Y and E918D) (32Day A.J. Willis A.C. Ripoche J. Sim R.B. Immunogenetics. 1988; 27: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Warwicker P. Goodship T.H.J. Goodship J.A. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One difference, G1551C, which results in the presence of threonine rather than arginine at residue 475, has not been previously reported. First, we examined transfected COS-1 cells on days 1, 2, 3, and 5 after transfection for the optimal time of expression of wild type factor H (Fig.1 A). In each case, an ∼165-kDa factor H polypeptide was present in the cells, and a slightly more slowly migrating, ∼168-kDa factor H was in the extracellular fluid. The difference in the relative electrophoretic mobility of the intracellular and extracellular polypeptides is due to glycosylation, as determined by N-glycosidase F experiments (data not shown), and is similar to that produced by the endogenous gene in fibroblasts (1Ault B.H. Schmidt B.Z. Fowler N.L. Kashtan C.E. Ahmed A.E. Vogt B.A. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25168-25175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Synthesis of factor H increased markedly between 1 and 2 days after transfection but did not change from day 2 to 5. Subsequent experiments were therefore performed at 2–3 days after transfection. Next we compared the expression of wild type factor H to that of several mutant factor H genes in transfected COS-1 cells after a continuous pulse of 8 h (Fig. 1 B). The results show the ∼165-kDa factor H in COS-1 cells transfected with wild type (WT) or C518R, C518A, or C518A-C546A factor H constructs, but no factor H polypeptide was present in COS-1 cells transfected with vector alone (Vector) or in mock-transfected COS-1 cells (None). An ∼168-kDa factor H polypeptide was present in the extracellular fluid of COS-1 cells expressing the wild type factor H construct. A slightly slower migrating polypeptide was present in the extracellular medium of COS-1 cells transfected with C518R, C518A, and C518A-C546A factor H but in markedly lower amounts, indicating a block in secretion of the C518R, C518A, and C518A-C546A mutant factor H proteins. This decrease in secretion was also apparent at long (24-h) intervals of pulse radiolabeling (data not shown). A polypeptide of ∼45 kDa was also present in cell lysates but is a nonspecific product of immunoprecipitation, because it was also present in untransfected COS-1 cells and in COS-1 cells transfected with vector alone, and its immunoprecipitation was not blocked by cold purified factor H (data not shown). In other experiments, there was also a marked decrease in secretion of factor H in COS-1 cells transfected with C546A, C546R, and C941Y mutant factor H constructs (data not shown). We also compared wild type and mutant factor H expression in transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 2). An ∼156-kDa underglycosylated and ∼168-kDa mature factor H polypeptide was detected in HepG2 cells transfected with wild type factor H. The ∼156-kDa underglycosylated factor H polypeptide was predominantly present in HepG2 cells transfected with C518R, C546R, C518A, C546A, C518A-C546A, and C941Y mutant factor H. Factor H was not detected in mock-transfected HepG2 cells (None). An ∼168-kDa factor H polypeptide was secreted into the extracellular medium only by HepG2 cells transfected with wild type factor H. Factor H could not be detected in the extracellular medium of HepG2 cells transfected with the mutant factor H constructs. Together with the results of transfected COS-1 cells, these data indicate that the impairment in secretion is neither cell- nor species-specific. A comparison of the kinetics of secretion of wild type factor H with that of one mutant, C518R, in transfected COS-1 cells revealed (Fig.3) loss of the wild type factor H from the cells between 1 and 3 h of the chase period, coincident with the appearance of the ∼168-kDa factor H in the extracellular medium. Densitometric analysis of four separate experiments indicated that 95% of the initial factor H-specific radioactivity could be accounted for in cell lysates and extracellular medium taken together, and the half time for secretion was 2.5 h. In contrast, the C518R mutant factor H only began to disappear from the intracellular compartment between 6 and 12 h of the chase period, and none was detected in the extracellular fluid. The half time for its intracellular degradation was 7.77 h (n = 6). The same pulse-chase protocol was used to investigate the fate of C941Y, C518A, C546R, C546A, and C518A-C546A mutant factor H molecules in transfected COS-1 cells. In each case, the mutant factor H molecule was retained in the cells, with none or a negligible amount detected in the extracellular fluid (data not shown). In the experiments presented in Fig. 4, we used pulse-chase radiolabeling to compare the rate of intracellular degradation of each mutant factor H molecule in transfected COS-1 cells with that of mutant factor H expressed in the cell line from the compound heterozygous factor H-deficient individual. First, we compared the transfected COS-1 cells expressing the C518R and C941Y mutants to the factor H-deficient human fibroblast cell line (Fig. 4, Aand B). The same ∼165-kDa polypeptide was synthesized in each case. The rates of intracellular degradation were similar for C518R and C941Y mutant factor H molecules in the transfected COS-1 cells, but in each case factor H was somewhat more rapidly degraded than in the deficient fibroblast cell line. However, the degree of experimental variation and the difference in cell type make it difficult to conclude that this apparent difference in rate of degradation is physiologically significant. Next, we compared transfected COS-1 cells expressing the C518A, C546R, C546A, and C518A-C546A mutant factor H molecules with each other (Fig. 4,A and C). The rates of intracellular degradation were almost identical. Densitometry and phosphor imaging analysis showed the following results for the half-time of intracellular degradation: factor H-deficient fibroblasts, 11.51 ± 1.96 h (n = 6); C518R, 7.77 ± 0.92 h (n = 6); C941Y, 8.96 ± 1.29 h (n = 5); C518A, 7.46 ± 2.10 h (n = 5); C546R, 7.91 ± 0.88 h (n = 2); C546A, 7.97 ± 1.41 h (n = 4); C518A-C546A, 6.15 ± 1.04 h (n = 4). All of the mutant factor H glycoproteins were sensitive to Endo H digestion even after 5 h of the chase period (Fig.5 A), consistent with retention in a pre-Golgi compartment. These results are comparable with similar experiments in control and factor H-deficient fibroblasts (Fig.5 B). All of the factor H retained in the factor H-deficient cells was sensitive to Endo H and N-glycosidase F, and none was secreted (right side of Fig. 5 B). Although most of the factor H present in the cell lysates from control fibroblasts was sensitive to Endo H, a small amount was resistant, and the secreted factor H was also Endo H-resistant (left side of Fig. 5 B). N-Glycosidase F digestion of the intracellular factor H in the control and deficient fibroblasts generated polypeptides of similar electrophoretic mobility. In control fibroblasts treated with 10 μg/ml brefeldin A before and during the pulse period, factor H was no longer Endo H-resistant (data not shown). In control fibroblasts treated with 20 μg/ml tunicamycin before and during the pulse period, the factor H polypeptide migrated at 146 kDa regardless of treatment with Endo H orN-glycosidase F, and its migration was identical to that ofN-glycosidase F-digested factor H in untreated control fibroblasts (data not shown). We also used immunofluorescence to determine the intracellular localization of mutant factor H molecules in transfected COS-1 cells. There was no significant difference in the pattern of factor H-specific immunofluorescent staining among COS-1 cells transfected with C518R, C546R, C518A, C546A, C518A-C546A, and C941Y mutant factor H constructs. In each case, there was a diffuse reticular staining of the cytoplasm especially prominent in the perinuclear region, which looked identical to the staining pattern of untransfected COS-1 cells with antibody to the ER-resident protein calnexin (data not shown). Double labeling experiments performed in COS-1 cells transfected with the C518R and the C941Y mutant factor H constructs showed colocalization of factor H and calnexin (Fig. 6). This colocalization was apparent in several focal planes. There was no colocalization of mutant factor H and a Golgi marker, wheat germ agglutinin (data not shown). Taken together with the Endo H experiments, these data indicate that all of the mutant factor H molecules are retained in the ER. In a previous study, we showed that impaired secretion of factor H in a factor H-deficient child with glomerulonephritis was associated with single amino acid substitutions, C518R on one allele and C941Y on the other allele. In this study, we used transfected cells to express wild type factor H, mutant C518R factor H, and mutant C941Y factor H alone. The results showed impaired secretion of each of the mutants in both transfected COS-1 cells and transfected HepG2 cells, indicating that the defect in secretion is neither cell type- nor species-specific. Endoglycosidase H digestion and immunofluorescence studies indicate that each of these mutants is retained in the ER. We then examined several possible mechanisms accounting for the impaired secretion of C518R and C941Y mutant factor H molecules. These mutations occur at the Cys2 position of the framework Cys2–Cys4 disulfide bridge in the ninth and 16th SCR module of factor H, respectively. Accordingly, using C518R as a model, we generated a series of mutant factor H molecules and transfected these to ascertain whether the impaired secretion was due to disruption of the disulfide bridge and/or a difference in size or charge of the substitution at residue 518. The results showed that the naturally occurring mutant, C518A, C546A, C546R (the latter two substituted at the Cys4 partner in the disulfide bridge) factor H prote"

The efflux elicited by a hypotonic shock was partially inhibited by adenosine receptor antagonists, by α,β-methyleneadenosine 5′-diphosphate (αβMeADP), an inhibitor of the 5′-ectonucleotidase, and by adenosine deaminase. On the other hand, dipyridamole, a nucleoside transporter inhibitor, increased the swelling-induced taurine efflux. Extracellular ATP and adenosine increased taurine efflux by potentiating the effect of hypotonic shock. αβMeADP strongly inhibited the effect of extracellular ATP but not that of adenosine. These results suggest that anion channel activation involves the release of intracellular ATP, which is then degraded to adenosine by specific ectoenzymes. Adenosine then binds to purinergic receptors, causing the activation of the channels. To directly demonstrate ATP efflux, cells were loaded with [3H]AMP, and the release of radiolabeled molecules was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. During hypotonic shock, cell supernatants showed the presence of ATP, ADP, and adenosine. αβMeADP inhibited adenosine formation and caused the appearance of AMP. Under hypotonic conditions, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by ionomycin caused an increase of ATP and adenosine in the extracellular solution.

Although the osmolarity of body fluids, particularly in mammalians, is tightly controlled, significant variations may occur in physiological or pathological conditions.

Usually cells respond to osmotic stresses by transporting organic and inorganic osmolytes through the plasma membrane. The lowering of extracellular osmolarity and the consequent cell swelling activate potassium and chloride channels (8Hoffmann E.K. Kolb H.A. Gilles R. Advances in Comparative and Environmental Physiology. 9. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 140-185Google Scholar). The resulting exit of KCl drives water efflux and therefore restores the original cell volume, a mechanism termed regulatory volume decrease. A key element in this process is represented by volume-sensitive Cl− channels, called volume-sensitive organic anion channel (VSOAC),1 which are also permeable to organic osmolytes such as taurine (9Strange K. Emma F. Jackson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C711-C730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kirk K. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 158: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 11Galietta L.J.V. Falzoni S. Di Virgilio F. Romeo G. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C57-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because taurine in many cells is accumulated at high concentrations through Na+-dependent transporters, the opening of VSOAC causes a significant taurine efflux, thus contributing to regulatory volume decrease. The mechanism underlying VSOAC activation is unknown. In a previous work performed on a tracheal epithelial cell line, we found that extracellular ATP is a potent modulator of swelling-induced VSOAC activation (11Galietta L.J.V. Falzoni S. Di Virgilio F. Romeo G. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C57-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding led us to test the hypothesis that release of endogenous ATP by the cells could be responsible for VSOAC activation during the hypotonic shock. Our experiments did not support this hypothesis because ATP was not revealed by the luciferin-luciferase method, and exogenous hexokinase did not inhibit VSOAC activity (11Galietta L.J.V. Falzoni S. Di Virgilio F. Romeo G. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C57-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast with our results, other investigators have found that there is a release of ATP induced by cell swelling (12Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 13Mitchell C.H. Carre D.A. McGlinn A.M. Stone R.A. Civan M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7174-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To reconcile these conflicting results, we have considered the possibility that ATP efflux in our cells could be masked by the rapid catabolism caused at the extracellular side of the membrane by specific ectoenzymes (14Meghji P. Burnstock G. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Meghji P. Pearson J.D. Slakey L.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The present article deals with the hypothesis that ATP is indeed released upon cell swelling and rapidly degraded to adenosine and that this nucleoside is the modulator of volume-sensitive anion channels, at least in our cell model. The 9HTEo− cell line was obtained by immortalization of human tracheal epithelial cells (16Gruenert D.C. Basbaum C.B. Welsh M.J. Li M. Finkbeiner W.E. Nadel J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5951-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 using a medium containing 45% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 45% Ham's F-12, and 10% fetal clone II serum plus 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were plated on 35-mm Petri dishes at a density of 40,000/cm2 and cultured for 4 days before performing taurine and ATP transport studies. The isotonic standard solution used for efflux experiments contained 130 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Na-Hepes pH 7.3, 10 glucose, and 20 mannitol (osmolality = 300 mosmol/kg). Hypotonic solutions (HS) were prepared by omitting mannitol and by lowering NaCl to 90 mm(205 mosmol/kg; 68% HS) or to 115 mm (250 mosmol/kg; 83% HS). For this study, we have taken advantage of the relatively large taurine permeability of VSOAC (11Galietta L.J.V. Falzoni S. Di Virgilio F. Romeo G. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C57-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to perform efflux experiments. This approach seems more appropriate than patch-clamp measurements to study the regulation of volume-sensitive channels, because taurine efflux experiments leave the cell interior undisturbed. The procedure for taurine efflux has been previously described (11Galietta L.J.V. Falzoni S. Di Virgilio F. Romeo G. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C57-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 μm taurine and 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]taurine. At the end of incubation, the loading medium was discarded, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold taurine-free medium. Taurine efflux experiments started with the addition of 1 ml of standard isotonic solution prewarmed at 37 °C. Every 5 min, for a total of 35 min, the efflux medium containing the taurine released by the cells was removed from the Petri dish and rapidly replaced by another ml of solution. The hypotonic shock was applied 15 min after the beginning of efflux. At the end of the experiment, cells were lysed by overnight incubation with 0.25m NaOH. The radioactivity present in the efflux samples and in cell lysates was determined by liquid scintillation. Total incorporated taurine T 0 was obtained by adding the radioactivity of all efflux samples to that remaining in the NaOH extracts. The taurine remaining in the cells at a given timet (T res) was determined by subtracting from T 0 the amount of radioactivity in the efflux samples up to time t. The time course of taurine efflux was expressed by plotting fractional efflux (FE)versus time. The FE at a given time was calculated according to FE =T ex/T res, whereT ex is the amount of taurine released in a single efflux interval, and T res is the amount of residual taurine remaining in the cells at the beginning of that interval. For ATP release experiments, cells were loaded for 1 h with 2 μCi/ml [3H]AMP. After loading, the cells were treated with the same protocol of taurine efflux experiments except for the lysis, which was accomplished by three rapid freeze-thaw cycles. The radioactivity collected in the efflux samples was normalized for the total radioactivity accumulated into the cells as explained above. Except where indicated, isotonic and hypotonic solutions during the efflux always contained 1 μm dipyridamole to block the uptake of adenosine. Two hundred μl of cell supernatants or 100 μl of cell lysates were analyzed in an LKB liquid chromatograph (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equipped with a Supelcosil LC-18-T column (15 cm x 4.6-mm inner diameter, 3-mm particle size; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and a Supelguard LC-18-T cartridge precolumn (Supelco). Buffer A was 60 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, pH 6.0, containing 5% (v/v) methanol. Buffer B was 70% buffer A and 30% (v/v) methanol. The mobile phase was developed at a constant flow rate of 1.5 ml/min as follows: from 0 to 6 min, 0–60% buffer B; from 6 to 10 min, 60% buffer B; from 10 to 12 min, 60–0% buffer B. The system and column were reequilibrated in buffer A for an additional 8 min before the subsequent injection. The column eluate was monitored through a model Flow-one Beta radioactivity detector (Packard Instruments Co, Meriden, CT). Scintillation liquid was Ultima-Flo M (Packard) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min, which yielded an approximately 25% efficiency. Peaks were quantitated by means of the Flo-one/Beta software (Packard), and substances were identified on the basis of coelution with their unlabeled counterparts monitored at 254 nm by a LKB multiwavelength UV detector. Cells were plated and cultured as described for efflux studies. To detect the activity of ectoenzymes, cells were incubated at 37 °C with the saline solution containing nonradioactive ATP or AMP-PNP. The cell supernatants were then analyzed by HPLC as explained above. Culture media and fetal clone II were purchased from HyClone (Cramlington, UK). [3H]Taurine and [3H]AMP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DMPX, DPCPX, U73122, and CGS21680 were from RBI (Natick, MA). AMP-PNP was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Data are presented as mean ±S.E. The points shown in each figure represent the mean of at least four experiments. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test for unpaired data. According to our hypothesis, the hypotonic shock would cause a release of endogenous ATP. ATP would then be converted to adenosine by extracellular local catabolism. Adenosine, by interacting with adenosine receptors, would be responsible for the activation of VSOAC during the hypotonic shock. To test this model, we applied the hypotonic shock (68% HS) in combination with known adenosine receptor antagonists. DPCPX, which is a specific inhibitor of A1receptors at low nm concentrations (17Shimada J. Suzuki F. Nonaka H. Ishii A. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 924-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), significantly inhibited the peak of swelling-induced taurine release (Fig.1, A and B). The effect was partial and dose-dependent with a maximal inhibition of 34% and a half-effective concentration equal to 16 nm (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, DMPX, an antagonist that acts at concentrations in the low μm range with a slight selectivity for A2 versus A1receptors (18Ukena D. Shamim M.T. Padgett W. Daly J.W. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), was also able to inhibit taurine efflux (Fig. 1,A and B). Maximal inhibition and half-effective concentration were 44% and 560 nm, respectively. When DMPX and DPCPX were used together at maximal concentrations (10 and 1 μm, respectively), the inhibition of taurine efflux was not different from that obtained by each antagonist individually. The inhibition of taurine efflux by adenosine receptor antagonists suggested that endogenous adenosine really contributes to swelling-dependent VSOAC activation. The next step was to assess the source of adenosine. Adenosine could directly originate from the cells or by hydrolysis of released ATP. Accordingly, we used αβMeADP, a potent blocker of 5′-ectonucleotidase, the ectoenzyme that hydrolyses AMP to adenosine (15Meghji P. Pearson J.D. Slakey L.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Siegfried G. Vrtovsnik F. Prie D. Amiel C. Friedlander G. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). αβMeADP inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the taurine efflux elicited by the hypotonic shock (Fig. 2). Maximal effect was 37%, and half-effective concentration was 510 nm.Figure 2Inhibition of taurine release by αβMeADP. A, time course of taurine efflux in the absence and in presence of 100 μm αβMeADP. The arrow marks the beginning of hypotonic shock (68% HS). FE was significantly inhibited at time 20 (p < 0.001) and time 25 (p < 0.05).B, the inhibition of taurine efflux measured at time 20 is plotted versus the αβMeADP concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We previously showed that extracellular ATP application results in a strong potentiation of hypotonic shock effect (11Galietta L.J.V. Falzoni S. Di Virgilio F. Romeo G. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C57-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We asked whether exogenous ATP also acts through the conversion to adenosine. Therefore, we applied 100 μm ATP in the 68% HS with or without αβMeADP. Interestingly, αβMeADP strongly reduced the taurine efflux elicited by the combined stimulation with ATP and hypotonic shock (Fig. 3). Actually, αβMeADP inhibition seems to result from complete block of ATP effect in addition to the expected partial inhibition of the efflux induced by the hypotonic shock alone. Extracellular application of adenosine also potentiated swelling-induced taurine release as ATP (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, under these conditions, αβMeADP was completely ineffective. Previous studies suggested that extracellular adenosine and ATP act in 9HTEo− and other airway cell lines by increasing intracellular Ca2+ through a phospholipase C (PLC)-based mechanism (20Rugolo M. Mastrocola T. Whörle C. Rasola A. Gruenert D.C. Romeo G. Galietta L.J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24779-24784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the hypotonic shock induced ATP and adenosine release, a PLC inhibitor should reduce the swelling-induced taurine efflux. We used U73122, an amino steroid that is able to potently block PLC when used at concentrations in the low μm range (21Smallridge R.C. Kiang J.G. Gist I.D. Fein H.G. Galloway R.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). U73122 (2 μm) reduced the peak of taurine efflux by 40% (Fig.4 A). We reasoned that if adenosine were the endogenous agonist that mediates the effect of hypotonic shock on taurine channels, adenosine deaminase (ADA), which converts adenosine to inosine, should have an inhibitory effect. ADA caused a significant decrease of the swelling-induced taurine efflux, although smaller than that of αβMeADP, DPCPX, and DMPX (Fig. 4 B). Nucleosides are taken up by the cells through specific transporters, some of which are sensitive to inhibitors like nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) and dipyridamole (22Griffiths M. Yao S.Y.M. Abidi F. Phillips S.E.V. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 23Yao S.Y.M. Ng A.M.L. Muzyka W.R. Griffiths M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28423-28430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We applied these compounds during the hypotonic shock to assess if they had an effect. Dipyridamole significantly increased taurine efflux under hyposmotic conditions (Fig. 5 A). NBMPR was instead almost ineffective (Fig. 5B). Previous experiments revealed that a mild hypotonic shock (83% HS) causes only a slight activation of the Cl− channels. However, this effect can be strongly potentiated by Ca2+-elevating agents such as ATP and ionomycin to obtain a channel activation comparable with that achieved with a stronger hypotonic shock (11Galietta L.J.V. Falzoni S. Di Virgilio F. Romeo G. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C57-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that adenosine also acts by synergistically increasing the volume-sensitive taurine efflux. CGS21680, an agonist selective for A2Aadenosine receptors (24Ongini E. Fredholm B.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 364-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), also increased taurine efflux (n = 3, not shown). Interestingly, αβMeADP did not inhibit adenosine effect but strongly antagonized that of ATP (Fig. 6). We also evaluated other nucleotides to clarify the mechanisms through which ATP affects channel activity. UTP and 2MeSATP were slightly active. In both cases αβMeADP was ineffective. We tested AMP-PNP because it has been often used as a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. Accordingly, this compound had to be ineffective if ATP acts through the conversion to adenosine. Unexpectedly, AMP-PNP was active, although less than ATP, and its activity was strongly reduced by αβMeADP (Fig. 6). Previous attempts to measure ATP release from 9HTEo− cells by the luciferin-luciferase assay were unsuccessful (11Galietta L.J.V. Falzoni S. Di Virgilio F. Romeo G. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C57-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we have therefore utilized an HPLC-based approach. We reasoned that this method, by revealing the presence of ATP catabolites, would have allowed detection of ATP release even in the presence of a rapid extracellular hydrolysis. Accordingly, 9HTEo− cells were loaded with [3H]AMP for 1 h. After this period, analysis of cell lysates revealed that 53.7 ± 2.3% (n = 5) of the radioactivity was due to labeled ATP. ADP, AMP, adenosine, and inosine accounted for 22.1 ± 1.1%, 8.6 ± 0.9%, 3.8 ± 0.4%, and 7.8 ± 0.5% total accumulated radioactivity, respectively. It is probable that [3H]AMP enter the cells as adenosine by the action of ectonucleotidase and adenosine transporters. Indeed, cell loading was strongly inhibited by dipyridamole or αβMeADP (not shown). Under isotonic conditions, cells loaded with [3H]AMP released small amounts of radioactivity (Fig.7 A). Upon applying the hypotonic solution (68% HS), a small but significant increase of released radioactivity was observed in the first 10 min (Fig. 7,A and B). A milder hypotonic shock (83% HS) was instead without effect (not shown). We also wanted to assess the effect of intracellular Ca2+ elevation alone or in combination with the hypotonic shock. We found that ionomycin elicited per se an increased radioactivity release from [3H]AMP-loaded cells (Fig. 7 B). Stimulation with ionomycin plus hypotonic shock (68% HS) induced a much higher efflux (Fig. 7 B). Indeed, the effect was larger than the sum of the single responses to ionomycin and hypotonic shock. HPLC analysis revealed that hypotonic shock, in the first 10 min of stimulation, caused the release of radioactive species whose elution times corresponded to those of adenosine, ADP, and ATP (Fig.8, B and E). These peaks were absent in isotonic conditions (Fig. 8, A andC). On the other hand, supernatants of cells stimulated with ionomycin did not show a significant ATP, ADP, and adenosine release but a marked peak corresponding to inosine (Fig. 8 D). When cells were treated with ionomycin plus the hypotonic shock (68% HS), supernatants had a higher content of ATP with respect to that observed with only the hypotonic shock (Fig. 8 F; p < 0.05). Adenosine was also significantly increased (p < 0.01). Interestingly, when hypotonic shock (with or without ionomycin) was applied in the presence of αβMeADP, the adenosine peak was strongly reduced, whereas AMP, which was always undetectable in the other experimental conditions, was clearly visible (Fig. 8,E and F). Experiments performed using dipyridamole and ADA (Figs. 4 and 5) showed changes in VSOAC activity that we interpreted as due to changes in extracellular adenosine concentration. To validate this interpretation we removed dipyridamole from the efflux medium or, alternatively, we added exogenous ADA (0.2 units/ml). As expected, both procedures decreased the radioactive adenosine in the extracellular medium. Removal of dipyridamole reduced the adenosine peak from 1061 ± 133 to 585 ± 20 cpm (p < 0.05; not shown). On the other hand, application of ADA completely abolished the adenosine peak and caused an increase of inosine from 128 ± 68 to 1401 ± 144 cpm (p < 0.01). Our results suggest that 9HTEo− cells possess ectoenzymes able to degrade ATP. To directly demonstrate this process, cells were incubated for variable times with ATP (100 μm). The supernatants were then analyzed by HPLC. After 1 h (not shown) and, more markedly, after 2 h (Fig.9 B), the peak corresponding to ATP decreased, and additional peaks appeared. These peaks corresponded to ADP, AMP, adenosine, and inosine. The process of ATP hydrolysis did not occur when ATP was incubated in the absence of cells. When αβMeADP was included in the extracellular solution, the adenosine peak was abolished, whereas that of AMP was significantly increased (not shown). AMP-PNP was able to activate VSOAC in a αβMeADP-sensitive way (Fig. 6). This result suggested that this compound can be converted to adenosine. Accordingly, we incubated the cells with this compound. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of a contaminant in the AMP-PNP stock solution (see Fig. 9 C). According to the manufacturer instructions, this compound should be AMP-PNP after the loss of a phosphate moiety (i.e.ADP-NH2). After incubation with 9HTEo− cells, the main and the secondary peaks were decreased, whereas a peak corresponding to adenosine was clearly evident (Fig. 9 D). Incubation without the cells did not change the pattern of AMP-PNP-related peaks. Also in this case, αβMeADP decreased the adenosine peak and increased the AMP signal (not shown). Cells are able to face a hypotonic shock by activating ion channels (VSOAC) permeable to Cl− and organic osmolytes. The resulting efflux of osmolytes and water restores the original cell volume. The mechanisms responsible for VSOAC activation are unknown, although protein phosphorylation, membrane stretch, and changes in cytoskeletal organization have been proposed (25Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C755-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been postulated that hypotonically induced ATP release represents an autocrine stimulus for VSOAC activation (12Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 13Mitchell C.H. Carre D.A. McGlinn A.M. Stone R.A. Civan M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7174-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the hypotonic shock elicits an ATP release also in 9HTEo− tracheal epithelial cells. ATP is then hydrolyzed to adenosine by specific ectoenzymes. However, in our cells, adenosine and not ATP is the agonist responsible for VSOAC activation. Several evidences support this scheme. First, taurine efflux is significantly reduced by adenosine receptor antagonists such as DPCPX and DMPX. These compounds act with half-effective concentrations, consistent with an inhibition at the level of adenosine receptors (17Shimada J. Suzuki F. Nonaka H. Ishii A. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 924-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Ukena D. Shamim M.T. Padgett W. Daly J.W. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is not clear which adenosine receptor is involved in the regulation of volume-sensitive Cl− channels in 9HTEo− cells. The inhibition by DMPX and the activation by CGS21680 suggests the involvement of the A2A type (24Ongini E. Fredholm B.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 364-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, DPCPX, a selective A1antagonist, has an unusually low IC50 value for an A2A receptor (24Ongini E. Fredholm B.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 364-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Future studies with a series of agonists and antagonists could elucidate this point. The 5′-ectonucleotidase inhibitor αβMeADP, which blocks the conversion of AMP to adenosine (14Meghji P. Burnstock G. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Meghji P. Pearson J.D. Slakey L.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Siegfried G. Vrtovsnik F. Prie D. Amiel C. Friedlander G. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), reduces the swelling-induced taurine release to an extent similar to adenosine receptor antagonists. A comparable reduction is also obtained by using the PLC inhibitor U73122. This result is consistent with the finding that exogenous adenosine stimulates PLC with consequent intracellular Ca2+ increase in airway epithelial cell lines (20Rugolo M. Mastrocola T. Whörle C. Rasola A. Gruenert D.C. Romeo G. Galietta L.J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24779-24784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are also consistent with previous patch-clamp studies in which we found that stimulation of adenosine receptors results in VSOAC activation (26Galietta L.J.V. Rasola A. Rugolo M. Zottini M. Mastrocola T. Gruenert D.C. Romeo G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Another indirect indication of adenosine involvement is the finding that nucleoside transporter inhibitors increase and that ADA, conversely, decreases taurine efflux. Such results can be explained by hypothesizing local variations of adenosine concentrations sensed by adenosine receptors. Indeed, dipyridamole would increase the availability of extracellular adenosine by blocking the reuptake. The stronger effect of dipyridamole compared with NBMPR can be explained by its ability to also inhibit NBMPR-insensitive transporters (22Griffiths M. Yao S.Y.M. Abidi F. Phillips S.E.V. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 23Yao S.Y.M. Ng A.M.L. Muzyka W.R. Griffiths M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28423-28430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ADA probably decreases taurine efflux by degrading adenosine to inosine, thus lowering the adenosine concentration, which is sensed by adenosine receptors. ADA-dependent inhibition is smaller than that elicited by other treatments (DPCPX, DMPX, αβMeADP, U73122). This could be because of the difficulty encountered by a large enzyme to reach the sites on the plasma membrane where ATP release and hydrolysis occur or because the rate of adenosine production from ATP is faster than the rate of adenosine deamination to inosine. To further verify our hypothesis, we applied extracellular ATP to assess whether it mimics the effect of the endogenous ATP. We found that ATP potentiates the effect of mild and strong hypotonic shocks (83% HS and 68% HS, respectively) and that this effect is completely blocked by αβMeADP. Such a result suggests that exogenous ATP is degraded to AMP by ectoATPase and ectoADPase and then to adenosine by 5′-ectonucleotidase. Adenosine then activates VSOAC by interacting with adenosine receptors. Indeed, the inhibition by αβMeADP can be bypassed by application of exogenous adenosine. In support of this model is the finding that extracellular UTP, which is not able to activate adenosine receptors, is a poor agonist of VSOAC. Surprisingly, AMP-PNP, which is often used as a hydrolysis-resistant ATP analog, activates taurine efflux. Furthermore, its effect can be blocked by αβMeADP. Our experiments, however, demonstrate that incubation of 9HTEo− with AMP-PNP results in the appearance of adenosine in the cell supernatant. This process is probably due to hydrolysis because it is abolished by αβMeADP. Our observation is consistent with recent findings that AMP-PNP can be actually hydrolyzed by extracellular ATPases (27Cunha R.A. Sebastiao A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, other investigators have recently found that extracellular ATP may act in hypocampal slices by rapid conversion to adenosine and stimulation of adenosine receptors (27Cunha R.A. Sebastiao A.M. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These authors have proposed a “channeling” model to explain the process. According to this model, the enzymes responsible for ATP degradation, and adenosine receptors are closely clustered. This organization ensures that the product of each reaction goes directly to the next enzyme in the cascade. This model, termed preferential substrate delivery, has been also proposed to explain the kinetics of extracellular ATP hydrolysis in endothelial cells (15Meghji P. Pearson J.D. Slakey L.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The close organization of ectoenzymes and receptors and the consequent channeling of the compounds through the degrading cascade would account for the poor effect of large molecules like ADA. It has been reported that ectonucleotidases are clustered in caveolae, i.e. small invaginations of plasma membrane (28Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). This organization could also contribute to confine ATP and its catabolites so that ectoenzymes and purinergic receptors would sense local and not bulk concentrations. It is interesting to observe that our results clarify previously unresolved observations done with patch-clamp experiments on 9HTEo− cells (26Galietta L.J.V. Rasola A. Rugolo M. Zottini M. Mastrocola T. Gruenert D.C. Romeo G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Actually, we found that the activation of volume-sensitive Cl− channels by extracellular ATP could be inhibited by an adenosine receptor antagonist (DMPX). We may now conclude that this surprising behavior was because of the hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine, which is the actual agonist. Such a conclusion reveals that the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by ectoenzymes might be relevant even during patch-clamp experiments in which cells are continuously perfused with fresh solution. We have demonstrated by an HPLC-based approach that ATP is indeed released during the hypotonic shock (68% HS) in 9HTEo− tracheal epithelial cells. Previous attempts to detect ATP by the luciferase assay were unsuccessful (11Galietta L.J.V. Falzoni S. Di Virgilio F. Romeo G. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C57-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have no explanation for these previous negative results. It is possible that rapid nucleotide hydrolysis and the mechanism of preferential substrate delivery might reduce the amount of ATP that diffuses from the cells into the bulk solution. Interestingly, the ATP release does not occur when the milder hypotonic shock (83% HS) is applied. This behavior explains, at least in part, the quite different channel activity observed with the two hypotonic solutions. Indeed, with 68% HS, the taurine efflux is so fast that more than 50% of intracellular taurine is released in the first 5 min of stimulation (Fig. 1). On the contrary, with 83% HS, only 3% of taurine is released (Fig. 6). In other words, the relationship between the efflux and the extracellular osmolality is not linear, but a threshold for activation exists below 250 mosmol/kg. This threshold is probably because of the activation of ATP release only with strong hypotonic shocks. Actually, when exogenous adenosine is provided under mild hypotonic conditions (Fig. 6), the taurine efflux increases to levels comparable with those attained with 68% HS. Intracellular Ca2+ increase by application of ionomycin in isotonic conditions did not result in ATP efflux but caused a large release of inosine. However, combined stimulation with hypotonic solution (68% HS) and ionomycin elicited a stronger release of ATP if compared with hypotonic shock alone. In parallel, extracellular adenosine was also increased. αβMeADP markedly decreased adenosine and caused the appearance of AMP in hypotonic conditions. This behavior suggests that adenosine is not directly released by the cells but probably arises from ATP hydrolysis. Inosine was not lowered by αβMeADP, thus indicating that it does not derive from adenosine. Actually, the effect of ionomycin in isotonic conditions suggests that there is a separate Ca2+-dependent mechanism for inosine release. Our results do not match exactly those of other investigators (12Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). First of all, we find that adenosine and not ATP is the autocrine agonist of VSOAC during the hypotonic shock. Another difference lies in the degree of channel activation, which can be accounted for by the autocrine signaling. Actually, Wang et al. (12Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) reported that treating hepatoma cells with ATP-degrading enzymes like apyrase completely blocks the swelling-induced chloride channel activation. In our experiments, the various treatments only partially inhibited the effect of the stronger hypotonic shock. It appears therefore that in 9HTEo− cells, adenosine and ATP release are not essential for swelling-induced activation of VSOAC. However, the release of these substances appears to play an important modulatory role. Our findings suggest that important tissue-specific differences might exist in the mechanism of VSOAC activation. In conclusion, our experiments reveal that hypotonic shock induces a release of ATP from airway epithelial cells. ATP is then converted on the extracellular side of the membrane to adenosine, which binds to adenosine receptors to increase the activity of volume-sensitive chloride channels. This autocrine mechanism, which probably affects the speed and extent of regulatory volume decrease (29Kim H.D. Bowen J.W. James-Kracke M.R. Landon L.A. Camden J.M. Burnett J.E. Turner J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C86-C97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is likely modulated by intracellular Ca2+. The regulation of ATP release by cell volume and Ca2+ is probably important in the process of transepithelial chloride transport. Indeed, extracellular ATP represents a strong stimulus for chloride secretion in airway epithelia (30Mason S.J. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Several agonists, including ATP, induce an intracellular Ca2+ increase in airway epithelial cells (30Mason S.J. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 31Harris R.A. Pon D.J. Katz S. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J.

This response could elicit intracellular ATP release, which would further stimulate the cells in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. The sensitivity of the ATP release process to cell volume could help to control the activation of chloride channels. Indeed, excessive Cl− channel activity and Cl− secretion would cause cell shrinkage. This should stop the release of ATP, which otherwise would continue to stimulate Cl− channels.

Identification of intracellular signaling molecules controlling this channel thus may lead to an understanding of the regulation of membrane excitability. To determine whether Kir2.3 is modulated by direct phosphorylation of its channel protein and identify the phosphorylation site of protein kinase C (PKC), we performed experiments using several recombinant and mutant Kir2.3 channels. Whole-cell Kir2.3 currents were inhibited by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in Xenopus oocytes. When the N-terminal region of Kir2.3 was replaced with that of Kir2.1, another member in the Kir2 family that is insensitive to PMA, the chimerical channel lost its PMA sensitivity. However, substitution of the C terminus was ineffective. Four potential PKC phosphorylation sites in the N terminus were studied by comparing mutations of serine or threonine with their counterpart residues in Kir2.1. Whereas substitutions of serine residues at positions 5, 36, and 39 had no effect on the channel sensitivity to PMA, mutation of threonine 53 completely eliminated the channel response to PMA. Interestingly, creation of this threonine residue at the corresponding position (I79T) in Kir2.1 lent the mutant channel a PMA sensitivity almost identical to the wild-type Kir2.3. These results therefore indicate that Kir2.3 is directly modulated by PKC phosphorylation of its channel protein and threonine 53 is the PKC phosphorylation site in Kir2.3.

Kir2.3 is a member of the Kir superfamily and is expressed in several tissues including the central nervous system, heart, and kidney (3Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6240-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Tang W. Yang X.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other members in the Kir2 family, Kir2.3 is directly coupled to G proteins, a coupling that enables this channel to contribute to neurotransmission and cell-cell communications (6Cohen N.A. Sha Q. Makhina E.N. Lopatin A.N. Linder M.E. Snyder S.H. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32301-32305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Also, Kir2.3 is known to be modulated by several intra- and extracellular signal molecules including Mg2+, polyamines, protons, and protein kinase C (PKC)1 (7Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol.

A. 1996; 93: 12014-12019Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The modulation of channel activity by PKC is remarkable not only because PKC activators strongly inhibit channel activity by almost 50% but also because the signal transduction pathway of PKC is so common that a large number of extracellular messengers can act on this K+channel through the activation of PKC. This is particularly important when Kir2.3 channel modulation is considered in the central nervous system, because the control of neuronal membrane excitability by numerous neurotransmitters and hormones can occur via this K+ channel. Although Kir2.3 activity is affected by PKC activators and inhibitors, the critical PKC phosphorylation site is unidentified (8Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Without this information, it remains debatable whether the modulation is mediated by a direct phosphorylation of the channel protein or indirectly by other molecules that are activated by PKC. To determine the molecular substrate for the PKC phosphorylation, we perform experiments in which channel sensitivity to a PKC activator PMA was studied in several chimeras constructed between Kir2.3 and Kir2.1, another member in the Kir2 family that is insensitive to PMA (8Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The PKC phosphorylation site was identified using site-directed mutagenesis. Oocytes from female frogs (Xenopus laevis) were used in these studies. Frogs were anesthetized by bathing them in 0.3% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. A few lobes of ovaries were removed after a small abdominal incision (∼5 mm) was made. The surgical incision was closed, and the frogs were allowed to recover from the anesthesia. Xenopus oocytes were treated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (type I, Sigma) in OR2 solution (82 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 90 min at room temperature. After 3 washes (10 min each) of the oocytes with OR2 solution, cDNA (40–50 ng in 50 nl of double distilled water) was injected into the oocytes. The oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C in ND-96 solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate with 100 mg/liter geneticin added, pH 7.4. Kir2.1 (IRK1) and Kir2.3 (HIR) cDNAs were generously provided by Drs. Lily L. Jan and Carol A. Vandenberg. These cDNAs were subcloned in a vector for eukaryotic expression (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and used for expressions in theXenopus oocytes. Chimerical constructs between Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 were prepared by overlap extension at the junction of the interested domains using the polymerase chain reaction using thePfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1. Site-specific mutations were made using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Quickchange, Stratagene, CA). Correct mutations in both the overlapping polymerase chain reaction and site-directed mutagenesis were confirmed with DNA sequencing. All plasmids for oocyte injection were prepared with a QIAfilter Plasmid Midi Kit (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA). Whole-cell currents were studied on the oocytes 2–5 days after injection. The two-electrode voltage clamp procedure was performed using an amplifier (Geneclamp 500, Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) at room temperature (22–24 °C). The extracellular solution (KD-90) contained: 90 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Cells were impaled using electrodes filled with 3 m KCl. One of the electrodes (1.0–2.0 MΩ) was used as a voltage recording, which was connected to an HS-2 ×1L headstage (input resistance, 1011Ω), and the other electrode (0.3–0.6 MΩ) was used for current recording connected to an HS-2 ×10MG headstage (maximum current, 130 μA). Oocytes were accepted for further experiments only if their leak currents measured as the difference before and after a leak subtraction were less than 10% of the peak currents. The leak subtraction was not applied. Current records were low-pass filtered (Bessel, 4-pole filter, 3 db at 5 kHz), digitized at 5 kHz (12-bit resolution), and stored on computer disk for later analysis (pClamp 6.0.3, Axon Instruments) (10Jiang C. Sigworth F.J. Haddad G.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5590-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11Jiang C. Haddad G.G. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PMA was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for a stock concentration of 10 mm. Immediately before experiments, PMA was diluted to a concentration of 100 μm in the KD-90 solution. Thirty microliters were added to the recording chamber to reach a concentration of 1 μm. The final concentration of Me2SO was 0.01% or less in the present study (8Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (RBI, Natich, MA) was dissolved in double distilled water with a final concentration of 10 μm. All data for PMA and chelerythrine chloride were obtained with an exposure period of 8–20 min. Data are presented as means ± S.E. (n, number of oocytes), and differences in the mean were tested with the Student'st test or ANOVA (analysis of variance) and were accepted as significant if p ≤ 0.05. Whole-cell currents were studied in Xenopus oocytes that had received an injection of either Kir2.3 or Kir2.1 cDNA 2–5 days earlier. A high concentration of K+ (90 mm) was applied to the extracellular solution. The membrane potential was held at 0 mV and stepped to a series of depolarizing and hyperpolarizing potentials. Under such an experimental condition, strong inward rectifying currents were observed in both Kir2.3- and Kir2.1-injected oocytes. Exposure of these oocytes to PMA (1 μm) produced an inhibition of Kir2.3 currents by 40.9 ± 4.8% (mean ± S.E.,n = 6) (Fig. 1). The inhibition of PMA had a long lasting effect. As has been observed previously by Henry et al. (8Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we did not see evident recovery of channel activity in 20–30 min of washout. The inhibition of Kir2.3 was voltage-independent. The profile of the I/V relationship was identical in the presence and absence of PMA after they were scaled to the same size (Fig.2). Unlike the Kir2.3, however, a similar exposure caused only modest inhibition of Kir2.1 currents by 10.1 ± 4.4% (n = 4). This small change in current amplitude is insignificant in comparison with that of the vehicle control using 0.01% Me2SO in the KD-90 solution (p > 0.05, n = 4). These results are therefore consistent with previous observations on these two K+ channels.Figure 2Voltage independence of Kir2.3 inhibition by PMA. A, currents were recorded from an oocyte in the same condition as Fig. 1. B, these currents were inhibited by exposure to 1 μm PMA (8 min). C, I/V plots show that only the inward rectifying currents were affected by PMA.D, when currents in A and B are scaled to the same magnitude at −160 mV, the I/V relationship of the currents recorded in these two conditions becomes identical, indicating that the effect of PMA on Kir2.3 currents is voltage-independent. Open circles, control; solid triangles, PMA exposure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the PKC phosphorylation site in Kir2.3, we took advantage of the following established experimental results and constructed several chimeras between Kir2.3 and Kir2.1. 1) The effect of PKC on Kir2.3 and Kir2.1 has been well documented, and there is a clear difference in PMA sensitivity between Kir2.3 and Kir2.1. Thus, extensive pharmacological manipulations using PKC activators and inhibitors can be avoided. 2) Kir2.3 has a high homology with Kir2.1 in their peptide sequences, suggesting that recombinant proteins are likely to produce functional channels. 3) It is known that PKC phosphorylation sites are only located in the cytosolic side of the plasma membranes. 4) According to the widely accepted transmembrane topology, both Kir2.3 and Kir2.1 have their N and C termini inside the membrane. Hence, it is possible that the N- and/or C-terminal region contains the critical motif(s) for PKC phosphorylation. When the entire N-terminal region in Kir2.3 was replaced with a Kir2.1 counterpart (NI-HIR), the mutant channel lost its sensitivity to PMA (5.0 ± 3.9%, n = 6). In a chimera with its N-terminal sequence from Kir2.3 and the rest of the sequence from Kir2.1 (NH-IRK), we found that this mutant channel gained sensitivity to PMA (38.4 ± 2.3%, n = 4, p < 0.01 compared with wild-type Kir2.1), suggesting that the PMA phosphorylation site(s) is located in the N-terminal region of Kir2.3 (Fig. 3). Four potential PKC phosphorylation sites have been found in the N-terminal region of Kir2.3. To identify which one of them is the true PKC phosphorylation site, we focused on these potential PKC phosphorylation sites and generated several chimeras and site-specific mutations in which one or two of these sites were eliminated. We found that the serine residue at position 5 was not involved in PKC phosphorylation, because a removal of this residue by replacing the first 19 residues with the first 45 residues in IRK (N1–19HIR) did not significantly change the PMA sensitivity (34.7 ± 4.4%, n = 4,p > 0.05 compared with wild-type Kir2.3) (Fig. 3). Serine 36 and serine 39 had been previously proposed to be the PKC phosphorylation sites (8Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hence, these two residues were examined. Substitution of the middle part of the N-terminal region, including these two serine residues and the other 18 amino acids (N25–44HIR), did not reduce the PMA sensitivity of the chimerical channel (46.2 ± 6.2%, n = 3, p > 0.05 compared with wild-type Kir2.3) (Fig. 3). Site-specific mutation of both of these serine residues together (S36G,S39G) also had no effect on the inhibition of this channel by PMA (38.1 ± 1.5%,n = 4, p > 0.05 compared with wild-type Kir2.3) (Fig. 3). This suggests that neither of these two serine residues is the PKC phosphorylation site. Threonine 53 is another residue that appears to be a PKC phosphorylation site. It has a motif (VDTRWR) and is located near the first transmembrane (M1) domain. Site-specific mutation of this threonine into isoleucine (T53I-HIR) with all of the rest of the sequence intact completely abolished the channel sensitivity to PMA (1.6 ± 1.0%,n = 4, p < 0.001 compared with wild-type Kir2.3) (Figs. 3 and 4). Interestingly, the amino acid sequence around this residue is quite similar between Kir2.3 and Kir2.1. To see if the creation of this threonine can affect Kir2.1 sensitivity to PMA, a sequence including eight amino acid residues surrounding this threonine was introduced to Kir2.1 by substituting a corresponding sequence in the same region (N79–86IRK). We found that the chimerical channel became PMA-sensitive (37.8 ± 5.7%, n = 4, p < 0.01 compared with wild-type Kir2.1), although only three residues in this segment are different between Kir2.3 and Kir2.1. We further mutated the isoleucine residue to threonine in Kir2.1 at the same position as the threonine 53 in Kir2.3. This mutation (I79T-IRK) led to an emergence of the PMA sensitivity in the Kir2.1-based channel (42.6 ± 3.7%,n = 4, p < 0.05 compared with wild-type Kir2.1) (Fig. 4). This inhibitory effect of PMA was totally blocked with 10 μm chelerythrine, a PKC inhibitor (0.1 ± 2.1%, n = 3, 20 min of chelerythrine preincubation followed by 20 min of PMA exposure). Thus, these results indicate that threonine 53 is the only PKC phosphorylation site involved in the modulation of Kir2.3 channel activity. A number of neurotransmitters and hormones has been shown to modulate inward rectifier K+ channels via phosphorylation of the channel protein by PKC (12Sato R. Koumi S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13DiMagno L. Dascal N. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Schreibmayer W. Pfleugers Arch. Eur. J.

For example, substance P and neurotensin cause a slow excitation of neurons of the nucleus basales and substantia nigra. This is mediated by inhibition of inward rectifying K+ channels through the activation of PKC (17Wu T. Wang H.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 184: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,18Takano K. Stanfield P.R. Nakajima S. Nakajima Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 999-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes and renal epithelial cells, activation of PKC also produces an inhibition of Kir currents, although detailed functions of this inhibition are not fully understood (12Sato R.

In addition to the covalent modulation of channel activity, PKC has also been shown to affect the expression of these Kir channels (15Visentin S. Levi G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Shin K.S. Park J.Y. Kwon H. Chung C.H. Kang M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21227-21232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Characterization of specific Kir channels that are modulated by PKC has been carried out recently. Macica et al. (23Macica C.M. Yang Y. Lerea K. Hebert S.C. Wang W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F175-F181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that exogenous protein kinase C inhibits the wild-type but not the S4A mutant Kir1.1 channel. Fakler et al. (25Fakler B. Brandle U. Glowatzki E. Zenner H.P. Ruppersberg J.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1413-1420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have found thatN-heptyl-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, a specific PKC stimulator, causes Kir2.1 rundown. Henry et al. (8Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have indicated that Kir2.3 is strongly inhibited by PKC. The latter investigators have also shown no effect of PKC activators on Kir2.1. In the present study, we have observed a strong inhibition of Kir2.3 when the oocytes are exposed to PMA. However, the same exposure causes only a small and insignificant change in Kir2.1 currents, a result consistent with previous observations (8Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, Kir2.3 but not Kir2.1 appears to be modulated by PKC. Identification of the PKC phosphorylation site in Kir2.3 was attempted previously by Henry et al. (8Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) who studied Ser-36 and Ser-39 as potential PKC phosphorylation sites. By replacing these two serine residues with cysteine and alanine (S36C, S39A), they could not see channel expression and thus were unsuccessful in demonstrating the PKC phosphorylation site in Kir2.3 (8Henry P. Pearson W.L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have mutated Ser-36 and Ser-39 to glycine residues located in the corresponding positions in Kir2.1. These mutations have no effect on channel expression and its sensitivity to PMA, indicating that they are not PKC phosphorylation sites. The other serine residue at position 5 is not involved in PKC phosphorylation, because mutation of this residue does not change the PMA sensitivity as shown in our current study. Our results indicate that threonine 53 is the only PKC phosphorylation site that controls channel activity, because a substitution of this residue with isoleucine completely eliminates channel sensitivity to PMA. This is further strengthened by our results showing that a creation of this threonine residue in Kir2.1 at the same location leads to a strong inhibition of the mutant channel by PMA. In conclusion, the modulation of Kir2.3 by PKC phosphorylation of the channel protein has been demonstrated in our current studies. The PKC phosphorylation site is located in the N-terminal region. Threonine 53 with a VDTRWR motif is the substrate of PKC. We thank Drs. Lily L. Jan and Carol A. Vandenberg for their gifts, Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 cDNAs."

Treatment of animal fatty acid synthase dimers with dibromopropanone generates three new molecular species with decreased electrophoretic mobilities; none of these species are formed by fatty acid synthase mutant dimers lacking either the active-site cysteine of the β-ketoacyl synthase domain (C161A) or the phosphopantetheine thiol of the acyl carrier protein domain (S2151A). A double affinity-labeling strategy was used to isolate dimers that carried one or both mutations on one or both subunits; the heterodimers were treated with dibromopropanone and analyzed by a combination of sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, gel filtration, and matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry. Thus the two slowest moving of these species, which accounted for 45 and 15% of the total, were identified as doubly and singly cross-linked dimers, respectively, whereas the fastest moving species, which accounted for 35% of the total, was identified as originating from internally cross-linked subunits. These results show that the two polypeptides of the fatty acid synthase are oriented such that head-to-tail contacts are formed both between and within subunits, and provide the first structural evidence in support of the new model.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 2Chang S.I. Hammes G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although all of the functional domains are present on a single polypeptide, coupling of the individual activities necessary for catalysis of the overall reaction of fatty acid synthesis is performed only by the dimer (4Kumar S. Dorsey J.K. Porter J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Smith S. Abraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6428-6435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1981, Stoops and Wakil (6Stoops J.K. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5128-5133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that the bifunctional reagent dibromopropanone reacts with the FAS dimer such that the 4′-phosphopantetheine thiol of the ACP domain becomes cross-linked with the active site cysteine thiol of the β-ketoacyl synthase domain. The electrophoretic mobility of FAS on SDS-polyacrylamide gels was dramatically reduced following treatment with dibromopropanone, indicating that the cross-linking had occurred between the two subunits. Approximately two molecules of the reagent were incorporated into the fully cross-linked dimer, and the ability to synthesize palmitate was lost. These observations inspired a model for the FAS in which the two subunits are arranged in head-to-tail orientation, so that the β-ketoacyl synthase of one subunit is juxtaposed with the ACP domain of the opposite subunit and two sites for palmitate synthesis are formed per dimer (7Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Support for the two-site model was provided by experimental evidence showing that the FAS dimer, in which the chain-terminating reaction had been blocked, assembles and retains two long-chain fatty acyl moieties (8Singh N. Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3605-3611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Smith S. Stern A. Randhawa Z.I. Knudsen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Subsequently, sequencing (10Schweizer M. Takabayashi K. Laux T. Beck K.-F. Schreglmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 567-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Amy C. Witkowski A. Naggert J. Williams B. Randhawa Z. Smith S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22508-22513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the animal fatty acid synthase established unequivocally the arrangement of the functional domains in the FAS polypeptide as, starting from the amino terminus, β-ketoacyl synthase, malonyl/acetyltransferase, dehydrase, enoyl reductase, β-ketoacyl reductase, ACP, and thioesterase. The dehydrase and enoyl reductase domains are separated by a region of approximately 600 amino acids that has not yet been ascribed a specific function. Initially, only the condensation reaction was believed to be catalyzed across the subunit interface, but later, experimental evidence was obtained which demonstrated that the translocation of acetyl and malonyl moieties from CoA ester to the 4′-phosphopantetheine of the ACP domain also requires the dimeric form of the protein (14Petithory J.R. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus it has become generally accepted that the two subunits lie side-by-side in a fully extended, antiparallel configuration so that each of the two centers for palmitate synthesis requires cooperation between catalytic domains located in the amino-terminal half of one subunit with those of the carboxyl-terminal half of the companion subunit (1Wakil S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 3Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 15Chang S.I. Hammes G.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 1990; 23: 363-369Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This side-by-side, head-to-tail model had not been subjected to rigorous testing until recently when we introduced an in vitro mutant complementation strategy to map the functional topology of this multifunctional complex (16Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10569-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The approach requires the engineering of various modified FASs, in which the activity of one of the functional domains is specifically compromised by mutation. Heterodimers formed from subunits containing different, single mutations may be capable of fatty acid synthesis if the two mutations are located on domains that normally cooperate with each other across the subunit interface. To date, the results of this ongoing mutant complementation analysis have confirmed several key features of the original. For example, mutations in either the β-ketoacyl synthase or malonyl/acetyltransferase domain complement mutations in either the ACP or thioesterase domains, whereas mutations in the ACP and thioesterase domains fail to complement each other (17Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These findings confirmed that the β-ketoacyl synthase and malonyl/acetyltransferase domains, located in the amino-terminal half of the FAS polypeptide, can contribute to the same center of palmitate synthesis as do the ACP and thioesterase domains of the companion subunit. On the other hand, the complementation analysis also revealed some unanticipated properties that could not be explained by the prevailing model. First, conversion of the β-hydroxyacyl-ACP to the enoyl-ACP was found to be catalyzed by cooperation of the ACP and dehydrase domains of the same subunit (17Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because the dehydrase and ACP domains are separated by more than 1000 residues, this finding provided the first experimental evidence indicating that the two constituent polypeptides are not positioned side-by-side in a rigid, fully extended, antiparallel orientation but are coiled in such a way as to permit functional contacts between domains distantly located on the same polypeptide. Second, both the substrate translocation and condensation reactions were found to be catalyzed by cooperation of the malonyl/acetyl transferase and β-ketoacyl synthase domains, respectively, with the ACP domains of either subunit (18Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because the active centers of β-ketoacyl synthase and malonyl/acetyl transferase domains are separated from the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety by more than 1500 residues, this finding raised further doubts as to the validity of the fully extended, rigid antiparallel polypeptide model. We have proposed a revised model that retains the concept of head-to-tail orientation of the two subunits but also allows for head-to-tail interactions within each subunit (18Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Rangan V.S. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34949-34953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). At present, because the evidence in support of the revised model is derived entirely from functional studies performed with mutant FASs, we are now exploring experimental approaches that can provide structural data with which to test the validity of the new model. The results of the mutant complementation analysis imply that the active-site cysteine residue of the β-ketoacyl synthase domain of each subunit must lie close to the 4′-phosphopantetheine thiol of both subunits. This finding would appear to be inconsistent with the conclusion drawn from the original dibromopropanone cross-linking experiments by Stoops and Wakil (6Stoops J.K. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5128-5133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), namely that cross-linking occurs exclusively between subunits. However, the fact that three molecular species with retarded electrophoretic mobilities are formed by treatment with dibromopropanone has never been explained. Because an immediate inference of the revised model is that cross-linking would be expected to occur both within and between subunits, we have reinvestigated the specificity of the dibromopropanone reaction with the FAS to determine whether one of these species might represent an internally cross-linked subunit. 1,3-Dibromopropanone was purchased from Alpha Æsar, Ward Hill, MA, and purified by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (20Witkowski A. Naggert J. Witkowska H.E. Randhawa Z.I. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18488-18492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strategies for construction of cDNAs encoding the wild-type FAS, single domain-specific mutants and for introduction of His6 or FLAG tags have been described in detail previously (16Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10569-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Joshi A.K. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged C161A mutant was constructed by first generating a mutated partial cDNA fragment by polymerase chain reaction amplification, using a primer set M161T3/54B1152 and pFAS 74.20 (partial FAS cDNA in pUCBM20) as template (21Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Authenticity of the amplification product was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the fragment was moved stepwise into the full-length, wild-type carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged construct. The quadruple mutant (C161A,S581A,S2151A,S2302A) was assembled stepwise by incorporating partial cDNA fragments carrying individual mutations in to full-length FAS cDNA. At each step, successful introduction of the new substitution was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The final FAS cDNA constructs, in the context of the pFASTBAC 1 vector, were used to generate recombinant baculovirus stocks by the transposition method employing the BAC-to-BAC baculovirus expression system according to the manufacturer instructions. Sf9 cells were then infected with the purified recombinant viruses and cultured for 48 h at 27 °C. The tagged FAS proteins were partially purified from the cytosols as described earlier (21Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and then subjected to final purification by affinity chromatography (22Joshi A.K. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); glycerol (10%, v/v) was included in all buffers used for chromatography. Two different FAS dimer preparations, either wild-type, the single mutants C161A or S2151A, or the quadruple mutant (C161A,S581A,S2151A,S2302A), one containing the His6-tag the other containing the FLAG-tag, were mixed, and their subunits were randomized by dissociation and reassociation (22Joshi A.K. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The heterodimers consisting of one His-tagged and one FLAG-tagged subunit were purified by sequential affinity chromatography on columns of anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Eastman Kodak Co.) and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid/agarose (Qiagen, Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) as described previously (22Joshi A.K. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The FAS activities of the purified heterodimers were: wild type/wild type 2260 ± 80, C161A/wild type 1080 ± 30, S2151A/wild type 1080 ± 14, C161A/S2151A 142 ± 14 and C161A,S2151A,S581A,S2302A/wild type 102 ± 2 milliunits/mg. The latter heterodimer was used in lieu of a C161A,S2151A/wild type heterodimer (presently unavailable), because the S581A and S2302A mutations, which compromise specifically the malonyl/acetyl transferase and β-ketoacyl synthase activities, respectively (17Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), were found to have no effect on the reaction of the FAS with dibromopropanone (see “Results”). For clarity, this mutant is identified in the text by the two mutations that are relevant to this study, namely C161A,S2151A. The FAS storage buffer was replaced with 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7, containing 1 mm EDTA, either by successive dilution and concentration in Centricon-50 devices (Amicon. Inc., Beverly, MA), by centrifugation through a gel filtration column (23Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or by dialysis. Fresh solutions of dibromopropanone were prepared by evaporation of the benzene solvent from the stock solution and redissolution of the reagent in phosphate buffer. The concentration of the reagent was determined before every experiment as described previously (20Witkowski A. Naggert J. Witkowska H.E. Randhawa Z.I. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18488-18492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cross-linking reaction was carried out at 20 °C and quenched by the addition of mercaptoethanol to 1 or 2 mm. All buffers were flushed with nitrogen to remove dissolved oxygen. FAS preparations were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis using 2% polyacrylamide in the stacking gel and 4% in the running gel. Kaleidoscope standards (Bio-Rad Labs., Hercules, CA) were routinely applied to each gel and electrophoresis was continued until the myosin marker (blue) was about 0.5 cm from the bottom of the gel; thus, these run times are significantly longer than those typically used for SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Phosphorylaseb cross-linked standards (Sigma) were also included in some experiments. Pro-Blue (Owl Separation Systems, Woburn, MA) was used as a general protein stain, and the proportion of the various stained zones was estimated by densitometric scanning with the aid of NIH Image software (Version 1.60). For Western analysis, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and exposed successively to either murine anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) or murine anti-PentaHis monoclonal antibody (Qiagen Inc.), and then to alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Bio-Rad Labs, Hercules, CA), following the manufacturer protocols. The MALDI-TOF experiments were performed under conditions that result in protein denaturation and obliteration of specific noncovalent interactions. Mass spectra were recorded on a Voyager DE STR instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), equipped with a two-stage ion source, delayed extraction (24Vestal M.L. Juhasz P. Martin S.A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 9: 1044-1050Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and a high current detector. The Voyager/Grams software supplied with the instrument was used for instrument control and data analysis. All measurements were carried out in the linear mode. The linear path-length in this instrument is 2.0 m. Desorption ionization was initiated with a nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm with a repetition rate of 3 Hz. The overall acceleration voltage used was 25 kV. A sampling rate of 20 ns (50 MHz) and an input filter of 20 MHz were used for data collection. Each spectrum represents the sum of 150–250 individual laser shots, and mass measurements were done automatically using the instrument default calibration. FAS samples (0.5 μl in 5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.8) were mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution directly on the stainless steel sample target plate and allowed to dry at room temperature. The matrix solution consisted of 10 g/liter of sinapinic acid dissolved in 0.3% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid:acetonitrile (2:1, v/v). Proteins were chromatographed on a SigmaChrom™ GFC-1300 column (0.75 × 30 cm) in 0.25 mpotassium phosphate, pH 7 and 1 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and were detected by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm. Blue dextran, FAS dimers, and monomers were eluted with retention times of 9.0, 10.5, and 11.5 min, respectively. Overall fatty acid synthesizing activity was measured spectrophotometrically (25Smith S. Abraham S. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); one unit of FAS activity is defined as 1 μmol of NADPH oxidized per min at 37 °C. β-Ketobutyryl-CoA reductase activity of FAS was determined by monitoring the accompanying oxidation of NADPH as described earlier (17Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The interthiol decanoyl transferase activity of the β-ketoacyl synthase domain FAS was monitored by high performance liquid chromatographic separation of substrates and products as described previously (26Witkowski A. Joshi K.A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16338-16344Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cross-linked products were first separated on 1.5-mm SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein bands, revealed using an imidazole-zinc negative stain (27Fernandez-Patron C. Castellanos-Serra L. Rodriguez P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 564-573PubMed Google Scholar), were cut out; and metal ions were removed by incubation of the gel pieces successively with 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8, and water, each for 10–15 min. The proteins were then electroeluted in a Centrilutor (Amicon) using Centricon-50 or -100 units. During electroelution, the Tris-glycine-0.1% SDS buffer was cooled and continuously recirculated between the upper and lower chambers. The solution containing the purified cross-linked FAS species was adjusted to pH 11–11.5, by the addition of 1 m NaOH, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 or 2 h. In agreement with the earlier findings of Stoops and Wakil (6Stoops J.K. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5128-5133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stoops J.K. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3230-3235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as a consequence of treatment of the FAS with dibromopropanone, we observed the formation of three new molecular species with retarded electrophoretic mobilities on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1 A,species ii, iii, and iv). Typically, when a centrifuged gel filtration column was used to remove dithiothreitol from the preparation and the FAS was exposed to a 1.5-fold molar excess of reagent for 60 s, the species exhibiting retarded electrophoretic mobilities accounted for more than 80% of the total FAS species present. Formation of the three new molecular species occurred extremely rapidly and was accompanied by a loss in the ability of the protein to synthesize fatty acids; only 4% of the FAS activity remained after 60 s exposure to dibromopropanone (Fig.1 B). The rate of loss in ability to reduce β-ketobutyryl-CoA to butyryl-CoA was slower; about 15% of the activity remained after 60 s (Fig. 1 B). For the overall FAS reaction, complete integrity of both the β-ketoacyl synthase active-site cysteine and the phosphopantetheine of the ACP domain are crucial. However, for the reduction of β-ketobutyryl-CoA by the FAS, the β-ketoacyl synthase active-site cysteine is not required. Translocation of the β-ketobutyryl moiety from CoA to the ACP domain, reduction of the keto group and translocation of the product back to CoASH involves only the malonyl/acetyltransferase, the phosphopantetheine thiol and the β-carbon processing enzymes. The difference in rate of loss of these two activities suggested that perhaps the active-site cysteine residue is the primary target of the reagent, and indeed the rate of disappearance of the original speciesi paralleled closely the rate of loss of β-ketobutyryl-CoA reductase activity rather than the rate of loss of overall fatty acid synthesizing activity. This inference was further supported by the results of an experiment that compared the loss in β-ketobutyryl-CoA reductase and interthiol acyltransferase activities of FAS treated with different molar ratios of dibromopropanone. The interthiol acyltransferase reaction is catalyzed exclusively by the β-ketoacyl synthase domain and uses model substrates to assess the ability of the β-ketoacyl synthase to transfer acyl moieties between substrate and acceptor thiols via the cysteine nucleophile (26Witkowski A. Joshi K.A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16338-16344Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two different homodimeric FAS mutants were employed for this experiment, C161A, in which the β-ketoacyl synthase nucleophile is replaced, and S2151A, in which the site of posttranslational insertion of the phosphopantetheine is removed. In the presence of a two-fold molar excess of reagent, 90% of the interthiol acyltransferase activity associated with the S2151A mutant was eliminated (Fig. 2). Under identical conditions, less than 20% of the β-ketobutyryl-CoA reductase activity of the C161A mutant was lost. To achieve 90% loss in β-ketobutyryl-CoA reductase activity with this mutant, more than a 25-fold molar excess of reagent was required. In contrast, only a 1.5-fold molar excess of reagent was required to eliminate 85% of the β-ketobutyryl-CoA reductase activity associated with the wild-type FAS (Fig. 1 B). Clearly in the absence of Cys-161, the phosphopantetheine thiol attached to Ser-2151 is a relatively poor target for dibromopropanone. These results are consistent with Cys-161 being the primary target for the reagent in the wild-type FAS. Reaction of the second alkylating group of the bifunctional reagent with the phosphopantetheine thiol likely is facilitated by the proximity of the phosphopantetheine to the cysteine nucleophile, rather than by the inherent reactivity of the phosphopantetheine thiol. Three separate approaches were used to identify the three electrophoretic species formed uniquely as the result of exposure of the FAS to dibromopropanone. First, the electrophoretic species formed by treatment of a panel of mutant homo- and heterodimers were analyzed by general protein staining. Second, the presence or absence of individual subunits in each electrophoretic species was assessed by detection of the specific tags using Western blotting. This procedure clearly distinguishes between FAS polypeptides containing the His6 and FLAG tags because neither are the His6-tagged homodimeric FASs recognized by the anti-FLAG antibodies nor are the FLAG-tagged homodimers by the anti-His antibodies (22Joshi A.K. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Third, the molecular masses of the various species formed as the result of dibromopropanone treatment of the mutant FASs were assessed by gel filtration and mass spectrometry. The relative proportions of species i–iv present in the dibromopropanone-treated FAS were dependent on the method used to remove dithiothreitol from the preparations. Considerably more of the unmodified FAS species i remained when either the centrifuged gel filtration column or dialysis procedures were employed than when the Centricon-50 device was used. The proportion of speciesiii formed was also higher when the latter procedures were used. We attribute these quantitative differences to the susceptibility of the Cys-161 thiol to oxidation. The dialysis procedure is inherently slow, and the centrifuged gel filtration column procedure potentially exposes the FAS protein solution to a very large surface area after loading on the column and spinning out the solvent. The Centricon procedure, on the other hand, is relatively speedy and does not expose the FAS solution unduly to air. Typically then, using the Centricon procedure to remove dithiothreitol, more than 95% of the wild-type FAS can be cross-linked by dibromopropanone. Under these conditions, the major products formed are species iv, 45 ± 5%, and species ii, 35 ± 2%; species iii and species i account for only 15 ± 5 and 5 ± 2%, respectively. All subsequent experiments were performed using FASs that were freed of dithiothreitol using the Centricon procedure. On treatment with dibromopropanone, neither FAS dimers containing the C161A mutation in both subunits nor those containing the S2151A in both subunits formed any of the unique electrophoretic species produced by the wild-type FAS, as revealed by Pro-Blue protein staining (Fig.3, compare A andB). This finding confirmed the original observation of Stoops and Wakil (28Stoops J.K. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3230-3235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that only a cysteine and a pantetheine thiol are involved in the reaction of dibromopropanone with the chicken FAS and demonstrated that these thiols are located at positions 161 and 2151 in the rat FAS. Because mutants lacking the thiol at residue 2151 are still able to react with dibromopropanone at the Cys-161 thiol (see Fig. 2), it is clear that derivatization of FAS at a single site,i.e. without cross-linking, does not alter its electrophoretic mobility. Dibromopropanone-treatment of a heterodimer consisting of one FLAG-tagged wild-type subunit and one His6-tagged subunit carrying both the C161A and S2151A mutations yielded only one new electrophoretic"

In an attempt to establish the role of the transmembrane domain in receptor signaling, two chimeric TGF-β receptors, TβRI-II-I and TβRII-I-II, containing the opposite transmembrane domain were generated. When transfected into a mutant mink lung epithelial cell line R1B, which lacks functional TβRI, TβRI-II-I restored TGF-β1-induced transcriptional activation of a TGF-β reporter p3TP-Lux to ∼25% of the levels restored by wild-type TβRI. In the mutant mink lung epithelial cell line DR26, which contains a truncated, nonfunctional TβRII, wild-type receptor TβRII restored the TGF-β responsiveness, while the TβRII-I-II cDNA was inactive. When both TβRI and TβRII were transfected into R1B, DR26, or Mv1Lu cells, a low level of constitutive p3TP-Lux activity was observed. However, cotransfection of both transmembrane chimeric receptors, TβRI-II-I and TβRII-I-II, or the wild-type TβRI with the transmembrane chimeric TβRII-I-II resulted in high levels of ligand-independent receptor activation. These results suggest that the transmembrane domains of both TGF-β receptors are essential and play a pivotal role in receptor activation. To investigate the role of the transmembrane domain further, four type II transmembrane mutants were generated: TβRIIΔ-1, TβRIIΔ-2, TβRIIΔ-3, and TβRIIΔ-4, which have one, two, three, or four amino acids deleted at the N terminus of the transmembrane domain, respectively. Interestingly, co-expression of TβRIIΔ-1 with the wild-type TβRI in DR26 cells resulted in high levels of constitutive activation, while only low levels of the activation were observed when TβRIIΔ-2, TβRIIΔ-3, or TβRIIΔ-4 were co-expressed with the wild-type TβRI. However, TβRIIΔ-1 restored very little the TGF-β responsiveness in DR26cells. Expression of TβRIIΔ-2, TβRIIΔ-3, and TβRIIΔ-4 resulted in a progressive increase in TGF-β responsiveness, with TβRIIΔ-4 reaching the level of activity of the wild-type TβRII. Furthermore, like TβRII-I-II, co-expression of TβRIIΔ-1 with TβRI-II-I also resulted in high levels of constitutive activation. These results are consistent with an important role for the transmembrane region of the receptors.

Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar).

Franzien P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex is most likely a heterotetramer containing two molecules each of TβRI and TβRII (22Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Franzien P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further double immunoprecipitation analyses using lysates from metabolically labeled cells cotransfected with differentially epitope-tagged type II receptors have demonstrated that type II receptors form a homomeric complex both in the presence and absence of TGF-β (23Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also shown that both the extracellular and intracellular domains of type II receptor can interact with each other and form homomeric associations (23Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These results indicate that both type II extracellular and intracellular domains have an inherent affinity for each other in the absence of TGF-β. In addition, experiments using a yeast two-hybrid interaction assay and double immunoprecipitation analyses (25Chen R.-H. Moses H.L. Maruoka E.M. Derynck R. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12235-12241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have also shown that type I and type II receptors form heteromeric complexes even in the absence of TGF-β. Also, the type I and type II receptor extracellular domains alone or the intracellular domains alone form heteromeric complexes, again in the absence of ligand. Taken together, these results suggest that both the extracellular and intracellular type I and type II receptors domains have inherent affinities for each other in the absence of TGF-β and form preexisting, heterooligomeric receptor complexes. More recently, it has been shown that after ligand binding, TβRII formed a heteromeric complex with TβR-2.1 (26Okadome T. Yamashita H. Franzen P. Moren A. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30753-30756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of type II receptor and the intracellular domain of type I receptor. The TβRII·TβR-2.1 failed to signal any TGF-β response in R1B cells, which lack a functional type I receptor. These results suggest that the receptor heterooligomerization may be necessary but not sufficient for TGF-β signaling. Most recent studies on chimeric granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)/TGF-β receptors (27Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and chimeric erythropoietin (Epo)/TGF-β receptors (28Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have shown some surprising results. GM-CSF induces the TGF-β signaling through chimeric receptors αI and βII or αII and βI, which consist of the extracellular domain of GM-CSF α or β receptor fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of TGF-β receptor type I or II, but chimeric receptors αI and βI or αII and βII are signaling-incompetent. Similarly, Epo signals the TGF-β activity by binding to chimeric Epo/TGF-β receptors E-RI and E-RII, consisting of the extracellular domain of Epo receptor and the cytoplasmic TGF-β receptor type I and II, respectively. These studies confirmed that homodimerization of the receptor cytoplasmic domains of either type I or type II receptors does not activate the receptor complex and that heterooligomerization of the receptor cytoplasmic domains is required for receptor activation. However, given that the extracellular domain of the type II TGF-β receptor may also homodimerize (23Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12235-12241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it is surprising that the TβRII·TβR-2.1 complex failed to signal (26Okadome T. Yamashita H. Franzen P. Moren A. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30753-30756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet the Epo or GM-CSF chimeric receptors were signaling-competent. In addition, the intensity of E-RI and E-RII signaling depends on the combination of transmembrane domains in the chimeric receptors (28Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In cells expressing E-RI and E-RII chimeras where the transmembrane domains are Epo receptor in one construct and TGF-β receptor in the other, the maximum extent of growth inhibition was lower, compared with cells expressing E-RI and E-RII chimeras with either Epo receptor's transmembrane domains or TGF-β receptor's transmembrane domains (28Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Taking together the observations in these studies (26Okadome T. Yamashita H. Franzen P. Moren A. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30753-30756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we propose that the transmembrane domain may play a role in receptor activation. Given that the type I and II receptors form signaling-incompetent receptor complexes in the absence of ligand, we need to understand what change occurs in the receptor complex following ligand binding. The observations that (i) TβR-2.1 fails to reconstitute signaling despite heterodimerization with the type II receptor (26Okadome T. Yamashita H. Franzen P. Moren A. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30753-30756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) heterodimerization of the chimeric GM-CSF/TGF-β or Epo/TGF-β receptors results in active signaling (27Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and (iii) the transmembrane domain plays a role in E-RI and E-RII signaling (28Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4485-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) indicate that more work is required to define the role of the transmembrane domain in receptor activation. In particular, the role of the transmembrane domain in transmitting a signal following ligand binding is not clear. In order to investigate these questions, we have generated two TGF-β transmembrane chimeric receptors, in which the transmembrane domains of the type I and II receptors were interchanged, and four type II transmembrane mutants with a series of deletions in the transmembrane domain. The signaling activity of these chimeric and mutant receptors in mutant mink lung cells has been examined, and our results identify an important role played by the transmembrane domain in receptor activation.

ANcoI–XhoI fragment of ALK-5 (nucleotides 1–236) was used to replace the deleted portion of TβRI-E-pCRIIby ligating at NcoI and XhoI sites. Three fragments, TβRI-E, TβRII-T, and TβRI-C, were ligated to pcDNA I/Amp (Invitrogen) at HindIII and SphI sites to form the TβRI-II-I(-M2) cDNA construct. To create HA3-tagged transmembrane chimeric type II receptor TβRII-I-II(-HA3), a EcoRI–XbaI fragment consisting of three repeats of HA coding sequence was ligated to pcDNA I/Amp at corresponding sites; then, at itsHindIII and EcoRI sites, fragments TβRII-E, TβRI-T, and TβRII-C were ligated to the pcDNA I/Amp vector containing HA3. By replacing theXhoI–BamHI portion in TβRI-II-I(-M2) with a corresponding fragment in ALK-5, tagged wild-type TβRI(-M2) was created. Similarly, by replacing MluI–BglII cDNAs in TβRII-I-II(-HA3) with those in H2–3FF, TβRII(-HA3) was constructed. Similar PCR strategy has been used to generate the type II transmembrane mutant receptors (Fig. 1). Ligation of the extracellular fragment generated using primers RII-1s and RIIΔ-1a with the transmembrane-cytoplasmic fragment generated by primers RII-2s and RII-3a at their SpeI sites into the pcDNA I/Amp vector containing HA3 forms C-terminal HA3-tagged TβRIIΔ-1. This resulted in TβRIIΔ-1 containing a Leu160 deletion in the transmembrane domain of the type II receptor. Replacing RIIΔ-1a by RII-1a and ligating the two fragments at their XbaI/SpeI sites, TβRIIΔ-2 was generated, which results in a deletion of two residues (Leu160 and Leu161). To construct TβRIIΔ-3, which contains a deletion of three residues (Leu160, Leu161, and Leu162), the extracellular fragment generated by primers RII-1s and RIIΔ-3a and the transmembrane-cytoplasmic fragment generated by primers RIIΔ-3s and RII-3a were ligated at their AatII sites. Primers RIIΔ-4a and RIIΔ-4s were used to produce corresponding fragments, which were then ligated at their EcoRV sites to generate TβRIIΔ-4. It resulted in a deletion of four residues (Leu160, Leu161, Leu162, and Val163) in the transmembrane domain of the type II receptor (Fig. 1). COS-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Mutant mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) cells R1B and DR26 (10Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M.

The cells were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (CSL, Melbourne, Australia), 60 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using a DEAE-dextran protocol (29Mingarro I. Whitley P. Lemmon M.A. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1339-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and transfected cells were assayed 48 or 72 h later. 125I-TGF-β was purchased from Amersham Corp. Binding and affinity cross-linking assays using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) were performed as described previously (22Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Franzien P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 days after transient transfection with TGF-β receptor constructs, COS-1 cells in six-well plates were washed with binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mmMgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and incubated on ice for 3 h with 0.4 μCi of 125I-TGF-β/well in 200 μl of binding buffer. After incubation, the cells were washed with the binding buffer without bovine serum albumin and cross-linked with 0.5 ml of 0.28 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (3Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) (in binding buffer without bovine serum albumin) for 15 min on ice. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′,-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1.5% Trasylol (Bayer). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-M2 FLAG antibody conjugated beads (IBI; Eastman Kodak Co.) followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis using 10% polyacrylmide and autoradiography. The p3TP-Lux (10Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J.

Roberts. p3TP-Lux (6 μg) was co-transfected into mutant Mv1Lu cells together with 6 μg TGF-β receptor construct(s). The cells in a 10-cm dish were divided into six wells in six-well plates 24 h after transfection. At 48 h post-transfection, the media were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and three wells of each transfected cell line were stimulated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml). Thereafter, cells were lysed in 100 μl/well lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Cell lysates (20 μl/well) were used to measure the total light emission in 10 s using a luminometer (ML 3000 Microtiter Plate Luminometer). The rest of the cell lysates were directly analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis using 12% polyacrylamide followed by Western blotting. Anti-M2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from IBI-Kodak. Anti-HA3 polyclonal antibody was obtained from D. Bowtell (Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne). In order to identify and monitor the expression of TGF-β receptors, an octapeptide FLAG marker M2 was tagged to the C terminus TβRI and TβRI-II-I. A triple hemagglutinin epitope tag HA3 was fused to the C termini of TβRII and TβRII-I-II. The M2-tagged TβRI(-M2) and TβRI-II-I(-M2) receptors were transfected into COS-1 cells, and Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-M2 antibody showed that both were expressed (Fig. 2 A).

PGCP was co-purified from human placenta with lysosomal carboxypeptidase, cathepsin A, lysosomal endopeptidase, cathepsin D, and a γ-interferon-inducible protein, IP-30, using an affinity chromatography on a Phe-Leu-agarose column. A PGCP cDNA was obtained as an expressed sequence tag clone and completed at 5′-end by rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA contained a 1623-base pair open reading frame predicting a 541-amino acid protein, with five putative Asn glycosylation sites and a 21-residue signal peptide. PGCP showed significant amino acid sequence homology to several cocatalytic metallopeptidases including a glutamate carboxypeptidase II also known asN-acetyl-aspartyl-α-glutamate carboxypeptidase or as prostate-specific membrane antigen and expressed glutamate carboxypeptidase activity. Expression of the PGCP cDNA in COS-1 cells, followed by Western blotting and metabolic labeling showed that PGCP is synthesized as a 62-kDa precursor, which is processed to a 56-kDa mature form containing two Asn-linked oligosaccharide chains. The mature form of PGCP was secreted into the culture medium, which is consistent with its intracellular localization in secretion granules. In humans, PGCP is found principally in blood plasma, suggesting a potential role in the metabolism of secreted peptides.

In particular, an important brain glutamate carboxypeptidase II (EC 3.4.17.21) also called N-acetyl-aspartyl-α-glutamate carboxypeptidase (NAALADase)1 (8Robinson M.B. Blakely R.D. Couto R. Coyle J.T.

NAALADase is also required for the intestinal uptake of folate and is responsible for the resistance of some tumors to methotrexate (12Pinto T. Sufoletto B.P. Berzin M. Quia C.H. Lin S. Tong P.

Urology. 1997; 49: 104-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). NAALADase is a 94-kDa transmembrane protein, homologous both to the transferrin receptor and the bacterial cocatalytic zinc metallopeptidases (16Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recent cloning of the human ileal membrane dipeptidyl peptidase, I100 (17Shneider B.L. Thevananther S. Moyer M.S. Walters H.C.

We describe a new human peptidase of the NAALADase/PSMA family, a 56-kDa blood plasma glycoprotein termed PGCP, which was affinity-co-purified with the lysosomal carboxypeptidase, cathepsin A (CathA; EC 3.4.16.1). CathA forms a high molecular weight complex with β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23), sialidase (neuraminidase; EC3.2.1.18), and N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (EC3.1.6.4) that is essential for their function in the lysosome (18D'Azzo A.

About two-thirds of lysosomal CathA is not complexed with β-galactosidase and sialidase (21Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Arch. Biochem.

In vitro, CathA can inactivate regulatory peptides like endothelin, substance P, bradykinin, and angiotensin I (22Jackman H.L. Tan F.L. Tamei H. Beurling-Harbury C. Li X.Y. Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G.

J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that it can be involved in the regulation of central neural and cardiovascular functions. Our recent studies propose that CathA may be associated with the metabolism of peptides implicated in memory consolidation (30Ashmarin I.P. Buzinova E. Vinogradova M. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1997; 21: 153-162Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For purification of CathA, we designed an affinity column by coupling a specific substrate of CathA, Phe-Leu, to an epoxy-activated agarose matrix. Analysis of the protein fraction purified from human tissues using this column revealed a novel 56-kDa glycoprotein, PGCP. In this paper, we report cloning of PGCP cDNA; characterization of its primary structure, enzymatic activity, expression, and metabolism; and its immunolocalization in human tissues and cells, which altogether suggest that PGCP is a novel glutamate carboxypeptidase secreted into the blood plasma. A crude glycoprotein fraction was purified from 10 human placentas (∼5 kg of wet tissue weight) using a concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity column (21Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The preparation was passed through ap-aminophenyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-agarose affinity column to separate the β-galactosidase-CathA-sialidase complex and then applied onto a 20-ml Phe-Leu-agarose affinity column, which specifically binds CathA and cathepsin D (CathD) (21Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 20 volumes of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.75, containing 0.15 m NaCl, and eluted with 5 volumes of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu. The eluate was concentrated using an Amicone stirred cell with a PM-10 membrane, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, applied to an FPLC Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer, and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.4 m. The 0.075–0.1m NaCl fractions, which contained cathepsin D and PGCP, were pooled, concentrated, applied to a FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then eluted in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions corresponding to the first protein peak, containing only PGCP, were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −30 °C. The molecular masses of the eluted proteins were determined using the following molecular mass standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): blue dextran (∼2,000 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). A similar procedure was used for the purification of PGCP from mouse liver. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) on an 11% acrylamide gel. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Blue. For NH2-terminal sequencing, the proteins were electrotransferred to ImmobilonTM-P membrane (Millipore Corp.) in a Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad) for 2.5 h at 4 °C in 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, 10% (v/v) methanol at a current of 480 mA. After staining with Coomassie Blue R-250, the bands were excised, and amino acid sequences were determined in an Applied Biosystems 470 A gas phase sequencer. Sequences were analyzed using the BLAST network service of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD). The dbEST was screened with the NH2 terminal amino acid sequence of PGCP, DVAKAIINLAVYGKAQ(N)RSYERLALLVDTVG, using the NCBI pBLAST search engine. Clone 30142, which contained deduced amino acid sequence identical to the NH2-terminal sequence of PGCP (GenBankTMaccession number R18560), was supplied by the IMAGE Consortium, Human Genome Center (Livermore, CA). The 1.62-kilobase pair PGCP cDNA insert was excised by HindIII/NotI digestion, subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), and sequenced using the PRISM Ready Reaction Dye Deoxy Terminator cycle sequencing kit on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated sequencer. Conditions for sequencing were 25 cycles at 96 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 4 min. Products were purified by size exclusion chromatography on CENTRI SEP columns (Princeton Separations) and fractionated by electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing (8.3 m urea) polyacrylamide gel. Sequences were analyzed using the SeqED software. A 5′-PGCP cDNA subclone was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction from total human placenta RNA using a MarathonTMcDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) and an oligonucleotide primer, 5′-CCAATCGCTCATAGGATCTGTTCTG-3′, complementary to the PGCP cDNA sequence (nucleotides 178–202). The product was cloned into a pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Analysis of the amplified sequence and its comparison with sequence of EST clone 30142 and several other EST clones containing fragments of the PGCP cDNA showed that clone 30142 contained a complete cDNA of PGCP with the exception of the first nucleotide of the initiation ATG codon. To complete a PGCP cDNA at 5′, we amplified a 400-kilobase pair 5′-end fragment using a 5′-CGATAAGCTTGCGGCCGCACGAGGCATGAA-3′ primer, which contains the PGCP initiation methionine codon (underlined) plus 25 nucleotides of upstream sequence with HindIII andNotI sites (boldface type), a 5′-ACCCAGGATGGCTATCTTAT-3′ primer, and the pBluescript-PGCP vector as a template. The fragment was digested with HindIII and EcoRI and cloned into pBluescript-PGCP, from which theHindIII-EcoRI cassette had been excised, and the insert of the resulting construct (pBluescript-PGCPc) was completely sequenced on each strand as above. Human skin fibroblasts from normal controls were cultured to confluency in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Mediatech, Washington, D. C.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) of fetal calf serum (MultiCell) and antibiotics. Total RNA was isolated from the cell pellet or from human placenta tissue by ultracentrifugation in a CsCl2 gradient as described by Maniatis et al. (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 7.6-7.10Google Scholar). Purified RNA was analyzed by Northern blot as described (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 7.6-7.10Google Scholar). AHindIII/NotI PGCP cDNA fragment from clone 31259 was labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Oligolabeling Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as a hybridization probe. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PGCP were prepared as follows. A 577-kilobase pair fragment of PGCP cDNA spanning codons 127–320 was obtained byEcoRI/BglII digestion. After blunting with Klenow fragment DNA polymerase, the fragment was inserted into theSmaI site of pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting plasmid was expressed in Escherichia coli801-C to produce PGCP-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified from the bacteria homogenate by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. Purified fusion protein (1 mg), homogeneous by SDS-PAGE analysis, was used to immunize a rabbit. IgG fraction purified from the antiserum by ammonium sulfate fractionation was passed through a recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-Sepharose column to absorb the anti-glutathione S-transferase-specific antibodies. The resulting antibody preparation was used in a dilution of 1:10,000 or 1:15,000 for Western blotting, 1:500 for immunoelectron, and 1:200 for immunofluorescent microscopy. Cellular or tissue homogenates, concentrated cellular medium, blood serum, or purified preparation of PGCP, was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a NITRO ME nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA). The detection of protein bands cross-reacting with anti-PGCP antibodies was performed using the BM Chemiluminescence kit (Boehringer Mannheim) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The deglycosylation of proteins was performed by treatment of 20-μg samples with 2 units of endoglycosidase F (Sigma) in 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (w/v) dithiothreitol, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 17 h at 37 °C. The full-length PGCP cDNA was obtained by NotI restriction of pBluescript-PGCPc and cloned into the NotI site of pCMV expression vector (33MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T.

COS-1 cells were transfected with pCMV-PGCP expression vector using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection, different peptidase activities and control β-hexosaminidase activity were assayed in cell homogenates and medium. Cultured human skin fibroblasts of normal controls were fixed on the glass slides with acetone/methanol (4:1) at −20 °C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked for 1 h with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with anti-PGCP antibodies at a final dilution of 1:200 for 1 h at room temperature, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and further incubated for 30 min with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:100. Epifluorescent microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Cultured human skin fibroblasts were detached from the culture dishes with a rubber policeman, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The cell pellets were dehydrated in methanol and embedded in Lowicryl K4m as described previously (34Sylvester S.R. Morales C.R. Oko R. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1989; 41: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35Hermo L. Wright T. Oko R. Morales C.R. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 1113-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Ultrathin Lowicryl sections were mounted on 300-mesh Formvar-coated nickel grids (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Each section was incubated for 15 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl-buffered saline (TBS), containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 as well as 15% (v/v) goat serum and for 30 min with anti-PGCP antibodies diluted 1:500 in TBS. The sections were then washed four times with TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, incubated for 15 min in TBS containing 15% (v/v) goat serum, and for 30 min with colloidal gold (10 nm)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zollinger Inc., Montréal, Québec, Canada). The sections were washed two times with TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and two times with distilled water and counterstained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate (34Sylvester S.R.

Electron micrographs were taken using a Philips 400 electron microscope (Philips Electronics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). 48 h after transfection with pCMV-PGCP expression vector, COS-1 cells grown to confluency in 75-cm2 culture flasks (∼106 cells) were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then incubated for 2 h in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate, and for 40 min in 5 ml of the same medium supplemented with [35S]methionine (DuPont), 0.1 mCi/ml. The radioactive medium was then removed, and the cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and chased at 37 °C in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum. At the times indicated in the figures, the cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed for 30 min on ice in 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm α-toluenesulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min to remove the cell debris. 1.0 ml of lysate was incubated for 4 h with preimmune serum at a final dilution of 1:20. Then the pellet obtained from 300 μl of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) was added, and the resulting suspension was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated overnight with the anti-PGCP antibodies in a 1:100 final dilution and then for 2 h at 4 °C with the pellet from 100 μl of Pansorbin cells and precipitated as above. The pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. The antigens were eluted from the pellet by the addition of 100 μl of a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 m dithiothreitol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min, and 50 μl of each sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The molecular weights were determined with14C-labeled protein markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gels were fixed in acetic acid/isopropyl alcohol/water (10/50/40), soaked for 30 min in AmplifyTM solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), vacuum-dried at 60 °C, and analyzed by autoradiography. Immunoaffinity gel was prepared by coupling of 25 mg of anti-PGCP rabbit antibodies to 3 ml of BrCN-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) using the manufacturer's protocol. The PGCP-containing fraction of human plasma proteins obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation (33–50% saturation) from 30 ml of serum was loaded on the immunoaffinity column. The column was washed by 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.4 m NaCl, and eluted with 5 ml of 0.2m glycine buffer, pH 2.3. The pH of collected 1-ml fractions was immediately adjusted to 7.5 by 1 m Tris-HCl buffer. CathA activity was measured as described by Pshezhetsky et al. (24Pshezhetsky A.V. Vinogradova M.V.

Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) with bovine hemoglobin (Sigma) as a substrate; and β-hexosaminidase activity was measured using 4-methylumbelliferyl-glucosaminide (37Rome L.H. Garvin A.J. Allietta M.M. Neufeld E.F. Cell. 1979; 17: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Aminopeptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase, endopeptidase, carboxypeptidase, and esterase activities were assayed fluorometrically or spectrophotometrically as described previously using the following substrates (all Bachem or Sigma): H-Ala-AMC, H-Arg-AMC, H-Glu-AMC, H-Leu-AMC, H-Lys-AMC, H-Phe-AMC, H-Gly-Phe-βNA, Z-Arg-Arg-βNA, benzoyl-dl-Arg-pNA, Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-pNA, Suc-Phe-Leu-Phe-pNA, Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC, Z-Phe-pNA, FA-Ple-Ala, FA-Phe-Arg, FA-Phe-Glu, FA-Phe-Gly, FA-Phe-Phe, and FA-Glu-Tyr. Glutamate carboxypeptidase activity was measured with Ac-Asp-Glu (Sigma) substrate as follows. The 100 μl of incubation mixture contained 1 mm Ac-Asp-Glu and 1–5 μg of sample protein in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmZnCl2. After 1–15 h of incubation at 37 °C, samples were incubated for 3 min at 100 °C and mixed with 0.9 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mmNAD+ (Sigma) and 0.25 units/ml of bovine glutamate dehydrogenase (Boehringer Mannheim). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the concentration of glutamate was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using the calibration curve obtained with 1–200 nmol of glutamate. One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to a conversion of 1 μmol of substrate/min. Proteins were assayed according to Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. The fraction of crude glycoproteins of human placenta retained by the Phe-Leu-agarose affinity column contained four major proteins. We separated these proteins by FPLC ion exchange chromatography using Mono Q column (Fig.1) and identified three of them by NH2-terminal sequencing as cathepsin D (CathD) (peak I eluted at NaCl concentration between 0.057 and 0.1 m), CathA (peak II, 0.1–0.17 m NaCl), and a so-called IP-30 (39Luster A.D. Weinshank R.L. Feinman R. Ravetch J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12036-12043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a 30-kDa glycoprotein induced in hematopoietic cells in response to γ-interferon, the biological function of which is unclear (peak III, 0.27–0.35 m NaCl). Peak I in addition to 31- and 15-kDa subunits of CathD also contained a 56-kDa glycoprotein, further termed PGCP. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of PGCP, (G)DVAKAIINLAVYGKAQ(N)RSYERLALLVDTVG didnot match any of proteins in the Non-Redundant GenBankTM data base (all nonredundant GenBankTM cDNA sequence translations, plus all entries from the Protein Data Bak, Swiss-Prot, and PIR data bases). PGCP and CathD were resolved on a Superose 12 FPLC gel filtration column. Eluted fractions were analyzed for CathD activity and by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Using a Superose 12 column, the molecular mass of PGCP (peak I at Fig. 2) was estimated as 120 kDa, suggesting that PGCP may form homodimers of 56-kDa subunits. A search in the dbEST data base showed that the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of PGCP had a 100% identity with a deduced amino acid sequence of an EST clone 30142 (GenBankTM accession number R18560). From this cDNA fragment, which we extended by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction, we derived a cDNA that we predict contains the entire PGCP coding sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). This cDNA, confirmed by sequencing of several independent clones, contains a 1623-base pair open reading frame starting from a potential ATG initiation codon and 147 base pairs of 3′-untranslated region containing a polyadenylation site (Fig.3). On Northern blots of mRNA from human placenta and fibroblasts, the PGCP cDNA hybridized with a single ∼1.7-kilobase pair transcript, indicating that the acquired cDNA was near full-length (Fig.4).Figure 4Northern blot analysis of PGCP mRNA.20 μg of total RNA from cultured human skin fibroblasts (lane 1) and placenta (lane 2) were used.

This work shows that single and double Ala substitutions of His18 and Phe21 in IL-8 reduced up to 77-fold the binding affinity to IL-8 receptor subtypes A (CXCR1) and B (CXCR2) and to the Duffy antigen. These Ala mutants triggered neutrophil degranulation and induced calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2. Single Asp or Ser substitutions, H18D, F21D, F21S, and double substitutions, H18A/F21D, H18A/F21S, and H18D/F21D, reduced up to 431-fold the binding affinity to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Interestingly, double mutants with charged residue substitutions failed to trigger degranulation or to induce wild-type calcium responses mediated by CXCR1. Except for the H18A and F21A mutants, all other IL-8 mutants failed to induce superoxide production in neutrophils.

This study demonstrates that IL-8 recognizes and activates CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms. interleukin-8 melanoma growth stimulating activity monoclonal antibody Interleukin-8 (IL-8)1 is a chemokine secreted in response to injury and infection that selectively attracts and activates neutrophils. IL-8 is a 72–79-amino acid peptide that belongs to the CXC chemokine subfamily because its first two Cys are separated by a single residue. The NMR and crystal structures of IL-8 reveal that the polypeptide chain is folded into three antiparallel β-sheets and a C terminus α-helix (1Baldwin E.T. Weber I.T. St. Charles R. Xuan J.-C.

Gronenborn A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). IL-8 receptors belong to the superfamily of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. Several IL-8 receptor subtypes have been identified. Two structurally homologous receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, are expressed in neutrophils (3Thomas K.M. Taylor L. Navarro J. J. Biol.

Moreover, G protein-coupled receptors encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus bind IL-8 plus other chemokines (11Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of recognition and activation of IL-8 receptor subtypes are not well defined. Studies with IL-8 mutants created by site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides have demonstrated that the N-terminal triad, ELR, is a major determinant for binding affinity and activation of IL-8 receptors in neutrophils (12Hebert C.A.

Further studies with chemokine chimeras have shown that the region in between Cys7-Cys50 is also important for binding to the IL-8 receptors (14Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B.

In particular, this region contains a surface-exposed hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe17, Phe21, Ile22, and Leu43 which is separated by over 20 Å from the N-terminal ELR triad, and it has been suggested that residues in or adjacent to the hydrophobic pocket are major determinants for binding selectivity to both CXCR1 and CXCR2 (16Hammond M.E.W.

In this work, we have created IL-8 mutants in which residues corresponding to the epitope of blocking anti-IL-8 mAbs were substituted by Ala, polar, or charged residues. We determined that this epitope plays a major role in the differential recognition mechanisms of CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. But most importantly, this epitope also plays a role in the activation mechanism for CXCR1. Human blood was drawn from healthy human donors and layered in a Mono-Poly Resolving Medium (ICN Biochemical, Inc., Aurora, OH). Neutrophils and red blood cells were isolated in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer. Neutrophils were suspended in physiological buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Red blood cells were stored in Alsevers solution consisting of 114 mm dextrose, 27 mm sodium citrate, 71 mm NaCl (pH 6.1) at 4 °C. Rabbit neutrophil membranes were prepared as described (18Williamson K. Dickey B.F. Pyun H.Y. Navarro J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5371-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).

HL-60 cells were infected with these virus stocks and selected by limiting dilution and binding to125I-IL-8. Cell line HL-60 was selected for this study because it expresses a high density of CXCR1 (19Wood T.G. Prusak D.J. Dunn K.J. Navarro J. Prado G.N. Navarro J. Molecular Basis of Inflammation. 3.

The mutant constructs were subcloned into the thioredoxin-based vector GM-TRX for expression of thioredoxin-IL-8 mutant fusion proteins.Escherichia. coli GI724 transformed with mutant constructs was induced with 100 μg/ml tryptophan for 4 h at 30 °C. The cells were lysed by French press, and the fusion protein was purified by fractionation on a QAE anion-exchange column followed by a G-75 gel filtration column. Fractions enriched with thioredoxin fusion proteins were digested with enterokinase to release the IL-8 mutant protein. The digestion products were further purified by using an SP-650 cation-exchange column. IL-8 was iodinated by the chloramine-T procedure as described (3Thomas K.M. Taylor L. Navarro J. J. Biol.

The reaction was terminated by overlaying the incubation mixture on top of a 10% (w/v) sucrose solution followed by centrifugation. Radioactivity in the pellet was measured in a γ-counter. TheK i for each IL-8 mutant was calculated according to the equation derived by Cheng and Prusoff (21Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem.

Moreover, binding of IL-8 to the N-terminal fragment of CXCR1 causes perturbations in the NMR chemical shifts of His18 and Phe21 (26Clubb R.T. Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that these residues bind to the N terminus domain of the IL-8 receptors. Single and double IL-8 mutants were created by substitution of His18 and Phe21by Ala, Ser, or Asp. All these mutants exhibited reduced binding to the anti-IL-8 mAb (20Lu Z. Murray K.S. Van Cleave V. LaVallie E.R. Stahl M.L. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In this study we expressed recombinant IL-8 mutants as fusion proteins linked to thioredoxin. IL-8 mutants were purified to near homogeneity. Fig. 1 shows the purity of the IL-8 mutants, H18D and H18A/F21A, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To examine whether His18 and Phe21 residues play a role in the mechanisms of recognition and activation of the IL-8 receptors, we initially performed displacement of 125I-IL-8 bound to neutrophil membranes by IL-8 mutants. In TableI we showed that H18A and F21A mutants exhibited 4- and 3-fold increases in the K i, respectively, as compared with that of the wild type IL-8, suggesting a moderate reduction in binding affinity of the mutants toward IL-8 receptors. The substitution of His18 for Asp, or Phe21 for Ser or Asp resulted in larger increases in theK i (up to 40-fold) (Table I). To determine whether these two residues interact independently with the receptors or overlap, we examined the effect of double substitution mutants. As shown in Table I, mutants with double substitutions exhibited larger increases in the K i, up to 636-fold, than that of the wild type IL-8. Since these binding experiments were carried out with neutrophil membranes co-expressing both CXCR1 and CXCR2, we performed similar binding experiments with cells expressing either CXCR1 or CXCR2 to determine whether the IL-8 mutants exhibit receptor-subtype selectivity. Interestingly, similar to the binding with neutrophil membranes, large increases in theK i, up to 431-fold, were observed upon binding of IL-8 mutants to cells expressing CXCR1 (Table I). In contrast, a clearly distinct binding profile with less dramatic increases in theK i, up to 61-fold, were observed upon binding of IL-8 mutants to cells expressing CXCR2 (Table I). Further studies were focused on determining the binding profile of these IL-8 mutants to other IL-8 receptors. We selected to test the binding of IL-8 mutants to the red blood cells promiscuous chemokine receptor, the Duffy antigen, that binds IL-8, MGSA, Regulated on Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES), and Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 (MCP-1) (9Horuk R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17730-17733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of IL-8 to red blood cells showed aK i = 13.2 ± 0.4 nm (Table I) that was similar to the previously reported K d (10Horuk R. Zi-xuan W. Peiper S.C. Hesselgesser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17730-17733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that single and double substitution IL-8 mutants showed up to 241-fold increases in the K i (Table I) and a distinct binding profile from those exhibited against CXCR1 and CXCR2. These findings support the idea that IL-8 recognizes CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by distinct mechanisms.Table IKi values of binding of IL-8 mutants to IL-8 receptorsMutantNeutrophilsCXCR1CXCR2Red blood cellsWild type1.2 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.13.0 ± 0.213.2 ± 0.4H18A4.9 ± 0.67.8 ± 1.411.3 ± 1.712.7 ± 0.5F21A3.7 ± 0.45.0 ± 0.317.5 ± 2.121.7 ± 1.0F21S35.9 ± 1.429.7 ± 8.1NDaND, not determined.98.2 ± 9.2H18D44.6 ± 5.575.1 ± 5.317.6 ± 1.655.2 ± 3.4F21D48.1 ± 9.026.9 ± 1.371.4 ± 7.5396.8 ± 41.4H18A/F21A52.5 ± 9.161.4 ± 3.828.1 ± 2.949.4 ± 5.6H18A/F21S85.5 ± 14.3127.1 ± 25.041.5 ± 2.567.9 ± 5.0H18A/F21D763.4 ± 160.2251.2 ± 127.8182.2 ± 6.71712.1 ± 147.2H18D/F21D484.0 ± 135.6344.5 ± 117.3184.1 ± 15.93186.7 ± 1096.8K i values were estimated from displacement of125I-IL-8 bound to neutrophil membranes, red blood cells, and HL-60 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding CXCR1 or CXCR2 by unlabeled IL-8 or IL-8 mutants.

Activation of IL-8 receptors were evaluated by measuring the agonist-dependent rise in intracellular calcium in neutrophils and HL-60 cells expressing either CXCR1 or CXCR2. All single and double mutants triggered maximal calcium responses in neutrophils (data not shown), suggesting that the activation mechanisms on the IL-8 mutants are preserved. However, neutrophils co-express both CXCR1 and CXCR2, and it is possible that some mutants selectively activate either CXCR1, CXCR2, or both. Mobilization of intracellular calcium were examined with HL-60 cells expressing either CXCR1 or CXCR2. We found that mutants with single substitutions, and the double mutant H18A/F21A, exhibited calcium responses in a dose-dependent fashion (Figs.2 and 3). Maximal calcium responses were achieved at concentrations of IL-8 mutants near their K i, indicating that full receptor occupancy is not necessary for maximal calcium response as previously observed with the fMLP chemoattractant receptor (27Sklar L.A. Hyslop P.A. Oades Z.G. Omann G.M. Jesaitis A.J. Painter R.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11461-11467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, because these mutants elicited maximal calcium responses as those of the wild type IL-8, it is likely that these mutant sites are major determinants for the binding affinity to the receptors but not for the activation mechanisms of the receptors. On the other hand, double mutants containing either polar and charged or two charged residues showed a unique activation profile. For example, the mutant H18A/F21D triggered a calcium response in HL-60 cells expressing CXCR2 in a dose-dependent fashion and a maximal calcium response as IL-8 did (Figs. 3 and 4 B). In contrast, this mutant elicited a weak calcium response in HL-60 cells expressing CXCR1 (Figs. 2 and 4 A). This observation indicates that double mutants containing one or two charged residues are full agonists of CXCR2 but are partial agonists of CXCR1. These data suggest that IL-8 activates CXCR1 and CXCR2 by distinct mechanisms.Figure 3Dose-dependent curves for calcium responses of HL-60 cells expressing CXCR2. HL-60 cells expressing CXCR2 loaded with Indo-1 were stimulated with several concentrations of IL-8 or IL-8 mutants. IL-8 (○), H18A (▿), H18D (▵), F21A (■), F21D (●), H18A/F21A (▾), and H18A/F21D (▪) were added at the indicated concentrations for activation of CXCR2.

HL-60 cells expressing CXCR1 (A) or CXCR2 (B) were loaded with Indo-1. IL-8 (20 nm) was added to HL-60 cells expressing CXCR1 or CXCR2 to induce maximal calcium responses. A, H18A/F21D (2 μm) was added to HL-60 cells expressing CXCR1.B, H18A/F21D (500 nm) was added to HL-60 cells expressing CXCR2. These are representative records of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Except for double mutants H18A/F21D and H18D/F21D, all single and double mutants triggered release of β-glucuronidase in neutrophils (Fig.5). This finding suggests that the rise in intracellular calcium mediated by binding of H18A/F21D or H18D/F21D to CXCR2 is not sufficient to elicit neutrophil degranulation. Previous studies have indicated that MGSA, in contrast to IL-8, is a poor activator of superoxide production in neutrophils (28Moser B. Clark-Lewis I. Zwahlen R. Baggiolini M. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1797-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We have tested the effect of single and double mutants on superoxide production. IL-8 mutants at concentrations ranging from 100 nm to 2 μm failed to trigger superoxide production. The H18A and F21A mutants were only partially active (Fig. 6). These data indicate that activation of calcium responses mediated by both IL-8 receptor subtypes in neutrophils is not sufficient to trigger superoxide production. The results of this work have indicated that His18 and Phe21 are involved in the mechanisms of recognition to anti-IL-8 mAb (20Lu Z. Murray K.S. Van Cleave V. LaVallie E.R. Stahl M.L. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), CXCR1 and CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen of red blood cells. The data show that IL-8 recognizes CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen by different mechanisms. Furthermore, despite the high degree of sequence homology of CXCR1 and CXCR2, they appear to be differentially activated by IL-8. This is consistent with our previous work indicating that IL-8 binding to IL-8 receptor subtypes causes a higher rate of internalization of CXCR2 than that of CXCR1 (29Prado G.N. Suzuki H. Wilkinson N. Cousins B. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19186-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that agonist binding to IL-8 receptor subtypes trigger different internalization signals. Finally, this work shows that the transient rise of intracellular calcium is not sufficient to trigger neutrophil responses including release of β-glucuronidase and superoxide production. His18 and Phe21 are adjacent or are in the surface-exposed hydrophobic pocket that has been argued to drive the association of IL-8 to the receptor by hydrophobic interactions (17Williams G. Borkakoti N. Bottomley G.A. Cowan I. Fallowfield A.G. Jones P.S. Kirtland S.J. Price G.J. Price L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9579-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In our present work, substitution of His18 and Phe21 for Ala caused modest changes in binding affinity, calcium responses, and release of β-glucuronidase. These observations indicate that the hydrophobic nature of these residues does not play a major role in the mechanisms of recognition and activation of the IL-8 receptors. Although, these single Ala mutants are poor activators of superoxide production, suggesting that these mutants are not full agonists in terms of production of superoxide. Single or double substitutions of His18 and Phe21 by polar or charged residues produce major changes in binding affinity to CXCR1 and the Duffy antigen. In contrast, minor changes were observed with CXCR2. These findings support the idea that this epitope plays a role in determining binding selectivity among IL-8 receptors. Substitution of His18 and Phe21 by Ala, polar, or charged residues may lead to localized, long range, or gross structural changes. In our studies, the mutants do not appear to show gross structural changes because all the mutants trigger full calcium responses in neutrophils, and they exhibit different binding affinities toward CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. In addition, NMR chemical shifts of the mutant F21A are indistinguishable from the wild type, suggesting that this mutation causes a localized change (17Williams G. Borkakoti N. Bottomley G.A. Cowan I. Fallowfield A.G. Jones P.S. Kirtland S.J. Price G.J. Price L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9579-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). His18 and Phe21 are in close proximity to each other on the protein (Fig. 7). Whether these two residues overlap or interact independently with the IL-8 receptor subtypes remain to be established. In summary, our binding data generated with this set of IL-8 mutants strongly argue that distinct mechanisms operate in the recognition of IL-8 to CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen. Binding of IL-8 to the N terminus fragment of CXCR1 causes perturbations in the NMR chemical shifts of His18 and Phe21 (26Clubb R.T. Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This finding plus our binding data suggest that the selective recognition of IL-8 receptor subtypes by IL-8 is mediated by the interaction of His18 and Phe21 with the variable N terminus domains of IL-8 receptors (6LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25402-25406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of the patterns of calcium responses elicited with this set of IL-8 mutants, we can distinguish at least two sets of mutants. One set composed of H18A, F21A, H18D, F21D, F21S, H18A/F21A, and H18A/F21S exhibit wild-type calcium responses and release of β-glucuronidase. The other set composed of H18A/F21D and H18D/F21D are full agonists of CXCR2 but are partial agonists of CXCR1. This finding suggests that the chemical nature of both residues 18 and 21 in IL-8 is a major determinant for the calcium responses mediated by CXCR1 but not for the calcium responses mediated by CXCR2. It is likely that IL-8 contains distinct motifs for activation of IL-8 receptor subtypes. Interestingly, H18A and F21A release β-glucuronidase as the wild type IL-8 but are poor activators of superoxide production in neutrophils. This finding supports the idea that the single Ala mutants are partial agonists in terms of superoxide production. This study provides the framework to further elucidate the activation motifs in IL-8 that trigger the biological responses in neutrophils including superoxide production, phagocytosis, and degranulation.

Whereas many of these repair responses are linked directly to an increase in transepidermal water loss (a measure of barrier integrity), others, such as increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, may be the result of the attendant epidermal cell injury that accompanies barrier disruption (3Wood L.C.

Utilizing differential display, we have identified a protein whose mRNA was up-regulated after acute permeability barrier disruption. The corresponding cDNA was cloned and sequenced. Here we report that based on its high degree of predicted amino acid sequence identity (>97%), the cDNA is the murine ortholog of the recently cloned human translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6)1 for which a yeast homolog has been identified (9Si K. Chaudhuri J. Chevesich J. Maitra U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14285-14290Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The role of eIF6 in translation is not firmly established (10Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). 80 S ribosomal subunits, which are released from polysomes after translation termination, are in equilibrium with 40 S and 60 S subunits. Purified eIF6 from rabbit reticulocyte lysates binds to the 60 S ribosomal subunit and exhibits ribosome anti-association activity in an in vitro assay (11Raychaudhuri P. Stringer E.A. Valenzuela D.M. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF6 and another translation initiation factor, eIF3 (a multiprotein complex that also exhibits anti-association activity via its interaction with the 40 S ribosomal subunit), are thought to regulate the supply of ribosomal subunits necessary for translation initiation (10Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 12Moldave K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1109-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, temperature-sensitive mutants of other translation initiation factors (eIF4E (mRNA cap-binding protein) and eIF3η (a component of eIF3)) arrest in G1 and are classified as cell division cycle (cdc) mutants cdc33 andcdc63, respectively (13Brenner C.

Chem. 1987; 262: 2845-2851PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to isolating the full-length cDNA sequence of murine eIF6 and reporting the up-regulation of murine eIF6 mRNA levels in response to epidermal injury, we initiated studies using S. cerevisiae as a model to begin to understand the role(s) of eIF6 in the cell. We show here that complete deletion of the gene for the yeast eIF6 homologYPR016c from S. cerevisiae is lethal, indicating that YPR016c is essential. Furthermore, expression of eitherYPR016c-GFP or murine eIF6-GFP fusion proteins restored viability, suggesting that the YPR016c gene product is indeed yeast eIF6. A nuclear/perinuclear localization of the eIF6-GFP fusion proteins in yeast is also reported. Finally, we show that depletion of eIF6 results in reduced polysome size and dramatically reduces free 60 S ribosomal subunit content. Taken together, these results suggest that eIF6 plays a role in 60 S ribosomal subunit assembly, stability, or nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Mouse total RNA from assorted tissues was purchased from Ambion. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon. Yeast media and chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. RX Fuji films or Kodak Biomax MR (Merry X-Ray) films were used for autoradiography. Torsos of hairless mice (strain HRS/Jhr/+ (Jackson Laboratories) or strain SKH1 (Charles River Laboratories)) were treated with cellophane tape until transepidermal water loss reached 6–10 mg/cm2/h (normal rate = 0.2 mg/cm2/h) as measured with an electrolytic water analyzer (Meeco, Inc.). Controls were untreated animals. Mice were killed, and the epidermis was isolated as described previously (3Wood L.C. Jackson S.M. Elias P.M. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Total epidermal RNA from isogenic (HRS/Jhr/+) control and tape-stripped hairless mice was isolated using the Ultraspec-II RNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.). The Delta RNA Fingerprinting Kit (CLONTECH) was used to detect differentially expressed epidermal mRNAs 2 h after tape stripping, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 μg of total epidermal RNA were reversed transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using an oligodeoxythymidylic acid primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The cDNA templates from tape-stripped and control epidermis were used in the subsequent PCR fingerprinting reactions in the presence of primers P9 and P3, deoxynucleotide triphosphates, [α-33P]dATP, and KlenTaq Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH). The resulting PCR reaction products were applied to a 6% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gel in Tris-borate EDTA buffer and resolved after electrophoresis by autoradiography using Kodak Biomax MR film. Epidermal poly(A)+ or total RNA was extracted and prepared for Northern blots as described previously (3Wood L.C. Jackson S.M. Elias P.M. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). cDNA probes were labeled with 32P by the random priming method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). Hybridizations to RNA blots were performed as described previously (3Wood L.C. Jackson S.M. Elias P.M. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). A partial cDNA, band clw1 (see Fig. 1), was obtained using PCR amplification primers P3 and P9 supplied in the Delta RNA Fingerprinting Kit. Band clw1 (which was actually a mixture of different cDNA molecules) was isolated from the RNA fingerprinting gel and PCR-amplified using P3 and P9 (according to the kit instructions) and cloned into the A/T cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The correct clone was identified by differential DNA dot blot hybridization of the resulting plasmid subclones against32P-labeled cDNA that was reverse transcribed from either control or tape-stripped epidermal poly(A)+ RNA (15Callard D. Lescure B. Mazzolini L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 1096-1103PubMed Google Scholar). Subclones containing the clw1 insert displayed a darker hybridization signal using the 32P-labeled cDNA probe made from tape-stripped epidermal mRNA versus the probe made from control epidermal RNA. The 150-bp insert, clw1 (and all other murine cDNA constructs), was sequenced on a ABI 377 or 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the Biomolecular Resource Center (University of California, San Francisco), and all DNA sequences were analyzed using the Sequence Analysis Consulting Service at the University of California, San Francisco Adcom Computing Facility (node name, itsa), the Wisconsin Package Version 9.0 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI), and DNAstar. The full-length sequence of murine clw1 (later determined to be murine eIF6) cDNA was determined for mouse liver from 5′ RACE and 3′ RACE cDNA products using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) and the gene-specific primers 5′-GACCACAGAAAGCACACCAATCGT-3′ (5′ RACE) and 5′-ACGATTGGTGTGCTTTCTGTGGTC-3′ (3′ RACE), which were designed utilizing sequence data from the 150-bp partial cDNA clw1. After isolation, both the 5′ and 3′ RACE products were subcloned into pCR2.1 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Several different subclones of pCRclw5p and pCRclw3p (the resulting plasmids) containing inserts of the 5′ and 3′ RACE PCR products, respectively, were used as templates to obtain sequence data for full-length clw1 (eIF6) mouse liver cDNA. PCR reactions were performed using the Advantage cDNA Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH Labs, Inc) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All reactions were performed in a model TC480 DNA thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer Corp.). Standard procedures were employed for all studies in yeast (16$$Google Scholar).Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CBS8/13 (see TableI), a derivative of S288c (kindly provided by C. Beh, University of CA, Berkeley), was used for one-step gene replacement (17Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar) of the yeast eIF6 homolog,YPR016c. Briefly, the TRP1 gene was PCR-amplified from linearized plasmid pRS404 (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using primers 5′-GAGTATTTGGAACAAGAGCATAATTCAACTAACTCTAGAAAACAATAT GGCTTAACTATGCGGCATC-3′ and 5′-AAACAGACTTGAGGAAGGAGGGG AATCCCCTCAGGAGTACCTGACATCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG-3′. The 1.0kb PCR product, designed for homologous recombination at the YPR016c locus, was transformed into yeast by the lithium acetate procedure (19Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptophan prototrophs were isolated from minimal plates (SD). TheYPR016c deletion was confirmed by PCR analysis using primers which flank the integration site; 5′-CCCATATTCCTTTGTGCAGA-3′ and 5′-GTACATAATATACATACAAC-3′. A TRP+ heterozygous (diploid) colony, which contained the expected 1065-bp wild typeYPR016c PCR product and the 1330-bp PCR product (where theTRP1 gene had replaced the YPR016c ORF) was sporulated and subjected to tetrad analysis.Table IYeast strainsNameGenotypeCBS8/13MATa/α ura3–52/ura3–52 trp1Δ-63/trp1Δ-63 leu2Δ-1/leu2Δ-1 HIS3/his3Δ-200 mal/mal hap2/hap2LWY1MATa/α ura3–52/ura3–52 trp1Δ-63/trp1Δ-63 leu2Δ-1/leu2Δ-1 HIS3/his3Δ-200 YPR016C/ypr016cΔ∷TRP1 mal/mal hap2/hap2LWY2MATα ura3–52 trp1Δ-63 leu2Δ-1 his3Δ-200 ypr016cΔ∷TRP1 mal hap2 pLW-2 (YPR016c-GFP, URA3, 2μ)LWY3MATα ura3–52 trp1Δ-63 leu2Δ-1 his3Δ-200 ypr016cΔ∷TRP1 mal hap2 pLW-5 (YPR016c, LEU2, 2μ)LWY4MATα ura3–52 trp1Δ-63 leu2Δ-1 his3Δ-200 ypr016cΔ∷TRP1 mal hap2 pLW-1 (GAL1-YPR016c-GFP, URA3, 2μ)LWY5LWY3 pLW-1LWY6MATα ura3–52 trp1Δ-63 leu2Δ-1 his3Δ-200 ypr016cΔ∷TRP1 mal hap2 pCLW-1 (GAL1-mu eIF6-GFP, URA3, 2μ)LWY7LWY3 pCLW-1 Open table in a new tab pLW-1, a yeast expression plasmid that contains the GAL1 promoter in front of an amino-terminal fusion of yeast YPR016c and GFP (20Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar), was constructed as follows. The YPR016c ORF was amplified by PCR from S288c yeast genomic DNA using 5′-CGCGGCCGGCCGGACTCAATTTGAAAACTCCAATGAA-3′ and 5′-CGCGGCCGGCCGAGTAGGTTTCAATCAAAGTATCACG-3′. The resulting PCR product, with FseI sites engineered on both ends, was cut with FseI and ligated into the FseI site of pACA1580 to create a GAL1-regulated YPR016c-GFP fusion. pLW-2 contains 990 bp upstream of the initiating ATG with theYPR016c ORF to create an amino-terminal fusion of theYPR016c protein product with GFP under the control of theYPR016c endogenous promoter and was constructed as follows. The YPR016c ORF and 990 bp upstream of the initiating ATG codon were amplified from S288c yeast genomic DNA by PCR using 5′-GGCCGCATGCGTAGTACTGTGAATATCGTCATTGTCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGCCGGCCGAGTAGGTTTCAATCAAAGTATCACG-3′. The resulting PCR product, containing SphI and FseI sites engineered at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, was digested with these restriction enzymes and ligated into the SphI andFseI sites of plasmid pJP1. pCLW-1 was constructed for GAL1-regulated expression of murine eIF6 as an amino-terminal fusion to GFP in yeast and was constructed as follows. eIF6 was PCR-amplified from mouse liver Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) using primers 5′-CGCGGCCGGCCGGGCGTCGTTCGAAAACAACTGTGAA-3′ and 5′-CGCGGCCGGCCCATGTGAGGCTGTCAATGAGGGAATC-3′. The PCR product withFseI sites engineered at both the 5′ and 3′ ends was digested with FseI and ligated into the FseI site of pACA1580. pLW-5 contains a genomic DNA fragment including the YPR016cgene. This plasmid was isolated from a genomic library (2 μ,LEU2) by its ability to suppress the lethality of aypr016cΔ::TRP1 deletion in a multicopy suppression screen. To assess the functional interchangeability of murine eIF6 with the presumptive yeast counterpart Ypr016cp, we carried out a plasmid shuffling experiment. LWY3, which contains theypr016cΔ::TRP1 deletion and is viable by virtue of the presence of pLW-5 (YPR016c, LEU2), was transformed with either pLW-1 (GAL1-YPR016c-GFP,URA3) or pCLW-1 (GAL1-murine eIF6-GFP,URA3). The two transformants, LWY5 and LWY7 (also described in Table I), were grown under nonselective conditions in the presence of leucine and galactose, and the yeast uracil prototrophs LWY4 and LWY6, which maintained pLW-1 and pCLW-1, respectively, were isolated. LWY5 was used as a control strain for FACS analysis of LWY4. Yeast were grown in SGal + amino acid supplements and shook overnight at 30 °C. The next morning, cells were centrifuged and then resuspended in SD + amino acid supplements to A 600 = 0.05 and incubated at 30 °C for as long as 24 h. Cells were harvested in log phase (A 600 < 1.0) by centrifugation and washed once with water. Cells were then fixed in 500 μl of 70% EtOH for either 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. They were then washed twice in 20× TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and resuspended in 100 μl of 20× TE + RNase A (1 mg/ml), and incubation was continued for 4 h at 37 °C. Finally, cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 100 μg/ml propidium iodide, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the dark. Before FACS analysis, cells were diluted 10–20-fold in phosphate-buffered saline. A Becton-Dickinson FACScan benchtop cytometer was utilized at the Laboratory for Cell Analysis (University of California, San Francisco Mount Zion Cancer Center, San Francisco, CA). Analyses of polysome/ribosomal subunit profiles in strain LWY4 grown either in SGal (eIF6- induced) or for 16 h in SD (eIF6-depleted) were performed exactly as described by Zanchin et al. (21Zanchin N.I.T. Roberts P. De Silva A. Sherman F. Goldfarb D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5001-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), with the following exceptions. Cell extracts were isolated from 200-ml cultures grown to mid-exponential phase. Cycloheximide was added (10 mg/ml), and cells were centrifuged, washed once, and resuspended in breaking buffer (as described previously) that also contained phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (17 μg/ml). After cell lysis and centrifugation (as described previously), identical amounts of cell extracts (20A 254 units) were loaded onto 12-ml linear sucrose gradients (10–50%). After a 3-h centrifugation, the gradients were fractionated manually into 0.22-ml fractions starting from the bottom of the tubes. A spectrophotometer was used to monitor absorbance at 254 nm. GFP and 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride fluorescence was evaluated in living yeast using a Nikon Microphot fluorescence microscope. Yeast were incubated in the presence of 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride while being grown in liquid culture for 1 h before microscopic analysis. The control yeast strain used in the fluorescence microscopic studies was strain CBS13 (see Table I) harboring pACA1580. RNA fingerprinting was used to identify epidermal mRNAs that are differentially expressed 2 h after acute permeability barrier disruption by tape stripping. We chose this time point because previous work showed that mRNAs encoding proteins involved in permeability barrier repair are up-regulated within 0.5–4 h after acute barrier disruption (2Feingold K.R. Adv. Lipid Res. 1991; 24: 57-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wood L.C. Jackson S.M. Elias P.M. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Clin.

The cDNA band labeled clw1 was more abundant in the tape-stripped samples; therefore, it was isolated from the gel and PCR-amplified, and the purified clw1 subclone (isolation was described under “Experimental Procedures”) was used to probe an epidermal RNA blot. A RNA blot was prepared from the epidermis of outbred hairless mice that were subjected to acute barrier disruption by tape stripping. A single 1.3-kb mRNA hybridized with the 150-bp partial clw1 cDNA probe (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the levels of this epidermal mRNA (clw1) were increased after tape stripping, confirming the differential expression of clw1 mRNA in response to barrier disruption. Subsequent Northern analysis using the partial clw1 cDNA as a probe revealed that a single cross hybridizing 1.3-kb mRNA was present in a wide variety of mouse tissues. 2L. C. Wood, C. Grunfeld, and K. R. Feingold, unpublished results. We cloned the full-length clw1 cDNA from mouse liver by 5′ and 3′ RACE. Based on the high degree (>97%) of predicted amino acid sequence identity, it is likely that clw1 cDNA encodes the murine ortholog of human eIF6 (9Si K. Chaudhuri J. Chevesich J. Maitra U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14285-14290Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mouse liver eIF6 cDNA sequence has been submitted to GenBank (accession number AF047046). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of murine eIF6 does not reveal any obvious clues as to its function in translation. However, murine eIF6 and the human, yeast, and Drosophila presumptive homologs contain a potential nuclear export signal, LSSLLQVPLVA, which conforms to the consensus nuclear export signal described as a short, leucine-rich, hydrophobic sequence (22Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Whether this consensus sequence is functional is not known at the present time. We initiated studies in S. cerevisiae to delineate the cellular function(s) of eIF6. As a first step, the entireYPR016c ORF was replaced with the TRP1 gene to assess the phenotype of YPR016c (eIF6) knockout yeast. Tetrad dissection of 18 asci from the heterozygous diploid LWY1 (ypr016c Δ::TRP1/ YPR016c) resulted in a segregation pattern of two live spores and two dead spores. None of the viable segregants were TRP+, indicating thatYPR016c is required for viability. Microscopic examination of the meiotic segregants revealed that theypr016cΔ::TRP1 cells had arrested between the second and fourth cell divisions.2 The diploid strain LWY1 (ypr016cΔ::TRP1/YPR016c) was transformed with pLW-2 and sporulated. pLW-2 expresses aYPR016c-GFP fusion protein under the control of the endogenous YPR016c promoter. Tetrad analysis of LWY1 harboring pLW-2 produced four viable segregants (two TRP+segregants and two TRP− segregants), indicating that theYPR016c-GFP fusion protein was functional and could substitute for the endogenous YPR016c protein product. To determine whether murine eIF6 could functionally replaceYPR016c in yeast, ypr016cΔ::TRP1strains that contained either YPR016c (LWY4) or murine eIF6 (LWY6) expressed as GAL1-regulated GFP fusion proteins were constructed. The growth characteristics of LWY4 and LWY6 on SGal, conditions that up-regulate GAL1 promoter activity, were compared with a control strain (CBS13 harboring GAL1-GFP) in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3 (left side), the growth rates of LWY4 (harboringGAL1-YPR016c-GFP) and LWY6 (harboringGAL1-murine eIF6-GFP) versus control appeared somewhat slower on SGal, indicating that overexpression of the eIF6-GFP fusion proteins had no major effects on cell growth. This result also indicated that the murine eIF6-GFP fusion protein functionally replacedYPR016c gene function. When the growth rates of these strains were monitored in liquid SGal for three to four generations, both LWY4 and control yeast exhibited a doubling time of 4 h, whereas the doubling time for LWY6 was 6 h.2Importantly, when LWY4 and LWY6 were grown on SD (Fig. 3, right side), conditions that repress GAL1 promoter activity, cell growth was arrested. This result demonstrated that the cells were dependent upon GAL1-regulated expression of either theYPR016c-GFP (in LWY4) or the murine eIF6-GFP (in LWY6) fusion proteins for viability. We examined live cells by fluorescence microscopy to localize the eIF6-GFP fusion proteins in strains LWY2, LWY4, and LWY6. In LWY2, we did not detect any GFP fluorescence above the background (data not shown), in agreement with previous findings showing that eIF6 is in very low abundance intracellularly (11Raychaudhuri P. Stringer E.A. Valenzuela D.M. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, upon examination of nonsynchronous LWY4 and LWY6 cells during log-phase growth in liquid SGal, a major portion of the GFP fluorescence was concentrated in a nuclear/perinuclear location that colocalized with nuclear 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride staining (Fig.4 C, D, G, and H). In contrast, GFP fluorescence in control yeast (grown under the same conditions) that harbor the parent plasmid was localized uniformly throughout the yeast cell (Fig. 4 A). Because we only observed GFP fluorescence when the eIF6-GFP fusion proteins were overexpressed, we next determined whether the repression of YPR016c-GFP expression by incubating LWY4 cells in decreasing amounts of galactose would alter the GFP fluorescence pattern in living yeast. For these determinations, LWY4 and control cells were incubated during log phase (A 600 < 1.0) for 4 h in either SGal or SGal:SRaf (1:2; SRaf contains 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 20 g/liter raffinose), conditions that did not alter growth rates (data not shown), and then examined by fluorescence microscopy. Again, a distinct nuclear/perinuclear localization of YPR016c-GFP was detected in LWY4 cells grown in SGal:SRaf (Fig. 4 E). The localization of GFP fluorescence in control yeast (harboring pACA1580) grown in SGal:SRaf (1:2) was nearly identical to that shown in Fig. 4 A and was therefore omitted. Because temperature-sensitive mutants of two other translation initiation factors (cdc33 and cdc63) arrest in G1 (13Brenner C. Nakayama N. Goebl M. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3556-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Hanic J.P. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2845-2851PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hanic-Joyce P.J. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1987; 172: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we performed FACS analysis of the conditional mutant strain LWY4. For these determinations, LWY4 was grown for up to 24 h in SD, conditions that strongly repress YPR016c-GFP expression. For comparison, the control LWY5 strain was analyzed at the same A 600 reading after only 5–7 h in SD. These different time points were chosen because 3–4 h after the switch from SGal to SD, the growth of LWY4 begins to decline in comparison to that of LWY5. No differences in FACS profiles were detected when LWY4 cells were grown for 1, 4, or 8 h in SD as compared with control LWY5 cells.2 However, FACS profiles showed that the eIF6 conditionally mutant strain LWY4 arrested in G1 after several generations in SD (after either 16 h2 or 24 h; Fig. 5). Thus, depletion of eIF6 from S. cerevisiae resulted in the same cell division cycle phenotype as reported for two other translation initiation factors, cdc33 and cdc63. Based on this result, we have designated the genetic locus YPR016c ascdc95. In addition, by forward angle scattering, we also determined that the relative size of LWY4 cells grown for several generations in SD is the same as that of LWY5 (control) cells grown to the same A 600 (data not shown). The effect of eIF6 depletion on translation initiation was determined by examining the polysome/ribosomal subunit profiles obtained from strain LWY4 grown in either SGal (eIF6-induced) or SD (eIF6-depleted). For these studies, LWY4 was grown to mid-exponential phase for 16 h (three to four generations) in either SGal or SD medium, cells were harvested in the presence of cycloheximide, and sucrose density gradient analyses were performed using previously published procedures (21Zanchin N.I.T. Roberts P. De Silva A. Sherman F. Goldfarb D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5001-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 displays one set of representative results obtained from three separate experiments. In all experiments, there was a drastic reduction in the size of the polysomes and the total amount of ribosomes present in cells depleted of eIF6. Although more difficult to quantitate, the pool of free 60 S subunits was greatly reduced as well. The pool of free 40 S subunits varied between experiments (increasing in some and decreasing in others) but remained, on average, roughly constant. The decrease in polysome size could reflect either a decrease in the cellular content of 60 S subunits (which would appear as an initiation defect) or"

We have found that expression of constitutively active MAPKK induces rapid morphological changes of fibroblastic cells, which are accompanied by disruption of stress fibers and disappearance of focal adhesions. These changes took place under the conditions that inhibited cellular Ras function, suggesting a linkage between the MAPK cascade and the control of cell morphology. We further show that constitutively active MAPKK can induce expression of endogenous Fos protein, an immediately early gene product, and cause the S phase entry of G0-arrested cells. Finally, expression of the N-terminal fragment of MAPKK which encompasses the nuclear export signal sequence and the MAPK-binding site blocked both the serum-induced S phase entry of quiescent cells and the oncogenic Ras-induced morphological changes. All these results demonstrate that MAPKK is one of key molecules involved in the control of both cell morphology and cell proliferation and suggest an important role for the N-terminal region of MAPKK in the regulation of the MAPK signaling.

One of these pathways is the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 cascade that is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and embryonic early development. In response to extracellular stimuli MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK, also known as MEK), a direct activator for MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, becomes activated and then activates MAPK in the cytoplasm (1Cobb M.H.

Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), which may, with some other transcription factors, activate many late genes required for the S phase entry of quiescent fibroblastic cells. Several experiments revealed a requirement of MAPK for serum-induced cell growth (10Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, the MAPK cascade is important for the initiation of cell proliferation. Ras is an upstream regulator of the MAPK cascade. Oncogenic Ras induces malignant transformation of fibroblastic cells, and as earlier cell responses, it causes both the S phase entry and the morphological changes (12Feramisco J.R. Gross M. Kamata T. Rosenberg M. Sweet R.W. Cell. 1984; 38: 109-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13Stacey D.W. Kung H.F.

Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the activation of the MAPK cascade is essential for the oncogenic Ras-initiated cell proliferation and transformation. Thus, the classical MAPK cascade has been thought to function primarily as a mediator of mitogenic signals through gene expression. On the other hand, little has been known about its role in the morphological changes induced by Ras. Constitutively active mutants of MAPKK are successfully generated by substituting acidic amino acids for two serine residues in the activation phosphorylation sites (16Alessi D.R. Saito Y.

We previously showed that a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) (residues 33–44) in the N-terminal region of MAPKK directs cytoplasmic localization of MAPKK (26Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Disruption of the NES by substituting alanines for essential leucines dramatically enhanced the ability of constitutively active MAPKK to induce malignant cell transformation (27Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role for the NES of MAPKK to suppress abnormal cellular responses. Moreover, it has been shown that MAPK binds to the N-terminal region of MAPKK (28Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Through this binding, MAPK appears to be retained to the cytoplasm (28Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Extracellular stimuli may induce dissociation of this MAPKK·MAPK complex, and MAPK is then translocated to the nucleus (28Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Thus, MAPKK may function as a cytoplasmic anchor for MAPK. In this study, we show evidence that the MAPK cascade is involved in the control of cell morphology and is sufficient for initiation of cell proliferation. We then demonstrate dominant-negative effects of the N-terminal region of MAPKK on the MAPK cascade signaling. DNA Constructions—pSRαHA-MAPKK and pSRαHA-LA-SDSE MAPKK were produced as described (27Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). pSRαHA-SASA MAPKK was generated from an EcoRI fragment of Xenopus MAPKK cDNA (29Kosako H. Nishida E. Gotoh Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) subcloned into M13mp18 by the methods of Kunkel et al. (30Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) using a mutagenic primer 5′-GGGCAACTCATAGACGCCATGGCAAATGCCTTTGTTGGGACAAGATCC-3′ as described (27Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of SASA MAPKK was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with a 5′ primer, 5′-ACTCAGATCTAACATGCCTAAAAAGAAG-3′, and a 3′ primer, 5′-GCCAAGATCTCTCACACTCCGGCGGCAT-3′, which produceBglII sites at both ends of SASA MAPKK. The BglII fragment of SASA MAPKK was cloned into pSRαHA1, yielding pSRαHA-SASA MAPKK. An N-terminal region (residues 1–60) of wild-type MAPKK and that of LA MAPKK (26Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with a 5′ primer, 5′-CCGGGGATCCATGCCTAAAAAGAAGCCTAC-3′, and a 3′ primer, 5′-GGCCGAATTCAACTTTCTGCTTCTGGGTGA-3′, which produce a BamHI site at the 5′-terminal and anEcoRI site at the 3′-terminal. EachBamHI-EcoRI fragment was cloned into pSRαHA1, yielding pSRαHA-MAPKK-(1–60) and pSRαHA-LA-MAPKK-(1–60), respectively. pSRα-RasV12 was kindly given by Dr. S. Hattori. The BglII fragment of LA-SDSE MAPKK was cloned into pET-16b (Novagen) to produce pET16b-LA-SDSE MAPKK (His-LA-SDSE MAPKK). The open reading frame ofXenopus MAPK was cloned into pcDL-SRα457 to obtain pSRα-MAPK. Histidine-taggedXenopus MAPKK (His-MAPKK) and histidine-taggedXenopus LA-SDSE MAPKK (His-LA-SDSE MAPKK) were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS pT-Trx by incubating with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 25 °C and purified as described (17Gotoh Y. Matsuda S. Takenaka K. Hattori S. Iwamatsu A. Ishikawa M. Kosako H. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1891-1898PubMed Google Scholar). His-MAPKK (2 mg/ml) and His-LA-SDSE MAPKK (2 mg/ml) were dialyzed against the injection buffer (20 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm KCl) before injection. Swiss 3T3 cells and MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 0.2 mg/ml kanamycin). For microinjection, cells were plated on glass coverslips or CELLocate coverslips (Eppendorf, Inc.), and grown as above to subconfluence. For Fos induction and BrdUrd incorporation assays, Swiss 3T3 cells were plated as above, grown to confluence, and then left overnight in serum-free medium to ensure that all the cells had entered the quiescent state. PD098059 (final 50 μm, from New England Biolabs), when used, was added to the culture media 30 min prior to injection. Microinjection was performed with an IM-188 apparatus (Narishige) as described previously (26Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). An anti-Ras mAb Y13-259 (10 mg/ml) and control rat IgG (10 mg/ml) were dialyzed against the injection buffer (see “Preparation of Recombinant Proteins”) before injection. For BrdUrd incorporation assay, BrdUrd (0.5 mg/ml) and insulin (1 μg/ml) were added to the culture media 1 h after injection, and then cells were cultured for 30 h. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (26Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To detect BrdUrd-positive cells, cells were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C with anti-BrdUrd mAb (5 μg/ml, Becton Dickinson), DNase I (0.5 mg/ml), and 0.1% bovine serum albumin followed by an RITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Cappel) and DAPI (0.1 mg/ml). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MAPKK proteins were detected with anti-HA mAb (12CA5). Focal adhesions were visualized with anti-vinculin mAb (VIN-11–5). Anti-Ras mAb (Y13-259) was a kind gift from Dr. S. Hattori. Injected Ras antibody and control rat IgG were detected with RITC-conjugated anti-rat antibody (Cappel). Anti-Fos antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. An anti-Xenopus MAPK antibody was produced in rabbit by using bacterially expressed recombinant His-tagged MAPK as an antigen. Fluorescence and phase contrast images were observed in an Axiophot (Zeiss) with a 63× plan-Neofl. (1.25 NA) objective. Although the cell transformation by constitutively active MAPKK is often accompanied by morphological changes of the cell, the effect of the MAPKK activation on early (≤24 h) morphological changes has been poorly understood. To examine the effect of activation of MAPKK on cell morphology in fibroblasts, we injected the nuclei of subconfluent Swiss 3T3 cells with a mammalian expression vector encoding an NES-disrupted, constitutively active MAPKK, LA-SDSE MAPKK in which leucines in NES are replaced by alanines and two serines in the activation phosphorylation site by aspartic acid and glutamic acid, respectively (27Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In agreement with our previous report (27Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), morphological changes with several protrusions and processes (Fig. 1 A,LA-SDSE, MAPKK) and disruption of stress fibers (data not shown) were induced in cells expressing LA-SDSE MAPKK within 18 h. Signs of the morphological changes were first seen at ∼8 h after injection. Rounding or spindle-shaped morphologies with refractile appearances were seen under phase contrast microscope (Fig.1 A, LA-SDSE, phase). We observed disruption of focal adhesions by LA-SDSE expression, as determined by vinculin staining (Fig. 1 A, LA-SDSE,vinculin). Normal, flattened cell morphologies with normal focal adhesions were seen in cells expressing wild-type (WT) MAPKK (Fig. 1 A, WT). We then expressed active MAPKK in an epithelial cell line MDCK which is polarized and has well developed cell-cell contacts including tight junctions. An expression plasmid encoding WT MAPKK or LA-SDSE MAPKK was injected into the nuclei of a few neighboring cells in a single colony consisting of about 100 cells. Although no apparent changes in cell morphology were induced by expression of WT MAPKK, a normal cobblestone-like cell shape was broken in cells expressing LA-SDSE MAPKK; the cells became rounded and shrunk (Fig. 1 B). Phase contrast images revealed the appearance of thin gaps between cells expressing active MAPKK (Fig. 1 B,LA-SDSE, phase), suggesting a reduced cell-cell attachment among neighboring cells. In addition, accumulation of actin filaments in the cell periphery was observed in LA-SDSE MAPKK-expressing cells (data not shown). Thus, expression of constitutively active MAPKK induces similar morphological changes in both fibroblastic and epithelial cells. The altered morphology of constitutively active MAPKK-expressing cells might not be a direct consequence of the activation of the MAPK cascade but rather result from some autocrine mechanism that leads to the activation of Ras which might induce morphological responses independent of the MAPK cascade (14Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). To address this, we investigated the effect of a neutralizing antibody against Ras, Y13-259, on the morphological changes induced by LA-SDSE MAPKK. The monoclonal antibody Y13-259 has been shown to block cellular H-, K-, and N-Ras function (31Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 32Hattori S. Ulsh L.S. Halliday K. Shih T.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and in agreement with a previous report with NIH 3T3 cells (31Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), injection of Y13-259 into the cytoplasm blocked serum-induced S phase entry of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig.2 A, Y13-259). Blocking efficiency was quite high when the entry of S phase was determined by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into the nucleus; only 6 out of 100 injected cells incorporated BrdUrd in the first experiment and 8 out of 100 in the second experiment. Control rat IgG did not block BrdUrd incorporation at all (Fig. 2 A,cont. IgG). These results confirm that Y13-259 is a strong and specific neutralizing antibody. Y13-259 was pre-injected into the cytoplasm of Swiss 3T3 cells inside the marked area of coverslips, and after 30 min the plasmid DNA encoding LA-SDSE MAPKK was injected into the nucleus of these cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, morphological changes, typical of those induced by LA-SDSE MAPKK, occurred even in the Y13-259-injected cells. The cells became rounded and shrunk, appeared refractile, and had some protrusions and processes. The antibody-injected cells were indistinguishable from uninjected cells. These results suggest that constitutively active MAPKK-induced morphological changes do not require Ras function. Consistent with this, expression of a dominant-negative form of Ras did not inhibit LA-SDSE MAPKK-induced morphological changes (data not shown). Therefore, it is suggested that morphological changes are primarily downstream events from MAPKK, although some effect through possible autocrine mechanism cannot be ruled out because cells surrounding the active MAPKK-expressing cells sometimes showed slight morphological changes. Then we tested whether oncogenic Ras-induced early morphological changes are mediated through a function of MAPKK. When an expression vector encoding RasV12 was injected into the nuclei of Swiss 3T3 cells, the cells became rounded, shrunk, and refractile, and numerous pinocytotic vacuoles appeared (33Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A, −). An inhibitor of MAPKK activation, PD098059 (34Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3242) Google Scholar), significantly inhibited these phenotypes (Fig. 3 A, PD098059), whereas Me2SO (a solvent for PD098059) had no effect (Fig. 3 A,DMSO). To confirm further a requirement of MAPKK for induction of these phenotypes by Ras, WT MAPKK, or SASA MAPKK (with an HA tag), a dominant-negative form of MAPKK in which two activating serines are replaced by alanines (35Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), was co-expressed with oncogenic Ras. Expression of SASA MAPKK, but not that of WT MAPKK, completely blocked the RasV12-induced phenotypes (Fig. 3 B). The staining intensity for HA tag confirmed the same level of expression of WT and SASA MAPKK. These results, together with the observation that inhibition of Ras did not interfere with the ability of active MAPKK to induce morphological changes (Fig. 2 B), suggest a linkage between the classical MAPK cascade and the control of cell morphology. Although previous studies suggested the importance of the MAPK cascade in the initiation of cell proliferation, it has not been determined whether activation of the MAPK cascade alone is sufficient for induction of an immediate early gene fos and the S phase entry of quiescent cells. To test this, we first injected the MAPKK plasmids into the nuclei of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells, and induction of endogenous Fos was examined. Expression of LA-SDSE MAPKK, but not that of WT MAPKK, induced endogenous Fos, as revealed by the appearance of bright nuclear staining with anti-Fos antibody (Fig.4 A). This level of Fos induction was roughly the same as the level of Fos that was induced by stimulation with 20% fetal calf serum, as judged by the staining intensity (data not shown). Then, to examine the S phase entry, we produced bacterially expressed WT and LA-SDSE MAPKK proteins, and we injected each of them into the cytoplasm of all the quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells inside the specified circle on the marked coverslips. After injection, cells were incubated for 30 h in the presence of insulin (36Morris J.D.H. Price B. Lloyd A.C. Self A.J. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 27-31PubMed Google Scholar) and BrdUrd. Whereas none of WT MAPKK-injected cells incorporated BrdUrd, approximately 40% of LA-SDSE MAPKK-injected cells incorporated BrdUrd (Fig. 4 B, BrdUrd). Therefore, activation of the MAPK cascade may be sufficient for the S phase entry of quiescent cells, as well as the induction of Fos. In our previous report we proposed a potential role of NES of MAPKK to prevent malignant cell transformation (27Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To test whether the NES-containing region has regulatory roles in the serum-induced G0/S transition and the Ras-induced morphological changes, we produced expression vectors encoding an HA-tagged N-terminal fragment of WT or NES-disrupted (LA) MAPKK (1–60 amino acids) (Fig. 5 A). This region contains both the MAPK-binding site (residues 1–32) and the NES sequence (residues 33–44) (28Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We expressed each of these fragments together with MAPK in Swiss 3T3 cells and determined their intracellular localization. The WT fragment was localized in the cytoplasm, whereas the LA fragment was present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. MAPK was localized in the cytoplasm when co-expressed with the WT fragment, whereas it was present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm when expressed with the LA fragment (Fig.5 B). Then we expressed these fragments in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells, and we examined the effect on the serum-induced S phase entry of cells. Expression of an empty vector did not affect 20% fetal calf serum-induced BrdUrd incorporation into the nucleus (Fig.6 A). Expression of the WT fragment, however, blocked the serum-induced S phase entry, whereas expression of the LA fragment did not significantly inhibit the BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 6 A). Fig.7 B represents a quantification of the result; 78% of vector-injected cells entered the S phase under the conditions, whereas none of the WT fragment-expressing cells entered the S phase, and 54% of the LA fragment-expressing cells incorporated BrdUrd.Figure 7Expression of the N-terminal fragment of MAPKK blocks oncogenic Ras-induced early morphological changes.pSRα-RasV12 (200 μg/ml) was co-injected with pSRαHA-MAPKK-(1–60) (+ WT) or pSRαHA-LA-MAPKK-(1–60) (+ LA) (300 μg/ml for each) into the nuclei of Swiss 3T3 cells. After 18 h, cells were fixed and stained as in Fig.3 B. At least 100 cells were injected, and a representative field for each sample is shown. Experiments are repeated 3 times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Finally, we examined the effect of these fragments on the oncogenic Ras-induced morphological changes. Each of these fragments was co-expressed with RasV12 in subconfluent Swiss 3T3 cells. Expression of the WT fragment inhibited the Ras-induced morphological changes; the cells were flattened and had few pinocytotic vacuoles and few protrusions (Fig. 7, + WT). In contrast, expression of the LA fragment did not inhibit the Ras-induced phenotypes; the cells were refractile and had many pinocytotic vacuoles and protrusions (Fig.7, + LA). The results depicted in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 reveal dominant-negative effects of the N-terminal region of MAPKK on the MAPK signaling. Although it was previously shown that the MAPK pathway is involved in a variety of cellular responses, the relationship between the MAPK cascade and the cell morphology remained undefined. In addition, it was also unclear whether the MAPK pathway was actually able to induce the S phase entry of quiescent cells. By using a constitutively active mutant of MAPKK (LA-SDSE MAPKK) whose kinase activity is the highest in the recombinant MAPKK mutants but still lower than that of normally activated, dually phosphorylated MAPKK (27Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we have here shown a link between the MAPK cascade and the control of cell morphology, and we have also shown the ability of the MAPK cascade to induce the expression of Fos and the S phase entry. A number of experiments suggested that Ras induces morphological changes and gene expression through different effector proteins (37White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar,38Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The Raf/MAPK cascade, one of the downstream components of Ras, was thought to function to transmit mitogenic signals to the nucleus to induce gene expression and not to participate in the regulation of cell morphology or actin reorganization (14Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 38Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that active MAPKK is able to induce dramatic changes in cell morphology which are accompanied by disruption of both actin stress fibers and focal adhesions and that inhibition of Ras function does not suppress the MAPKK-induced morphological changes. Moreover, we observed that inhibition of MAPKK or expression of the N-terminal portion of MAPKK suppresses oncogenic Ras-induced morphological changes. These results therefore suggest that the Ras-dependent morphological changes are at least partly mediated by the MAPKK/MAPK cascade. Downstream events or target molecules of MAPK which are involved in morphological changes remain to be elucidated. It has been reported that activation of Raf suppresses integrin activation probably through MAPK activation (39Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). It is possible that the MAPK cascade affects cytoskeletal network and cell adhesion machinery through phosphorylation of cytoplasmic target proteins. There were many reports showing that the MAPK pathway stimulates transcriptional activation from the exogenously transfected serum response element derived from the fos gene. However, c-fos gene transcription in vivo seems to require some chromatin modification such as histone H4 acetylation (40Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and thus does not occur readily. Our observation that active MAPKK induces expression of endogenous Fos protein suggests that activation of the MAPK pathway may result in some change in chromatin structure as well as in activation of transcription factors. We have further found that active MAPKK induces the S phase entry of G0-arrested cells. This is the first direct evidence that activation of the MAPK pathway alone is sufficient to induce initiation of cell proliferation and thus reinforces the essential role of the MAPK pathway for growth control. Finally we have shown dominant-negative effects of the N-terminal fragment of MAPKK on the MAPK signaling. One of possible molecular mechanisms for these effects is that the fragment with the normal NES retains endogenous MAPK in the cytoplasm through the MAPK-binding site and thus suppresses nuclear import of MAPK in response to upstream stimuli. The other is that the fragment inhibits the complex formation between MAPK and MAPKK. Recently it has been reported that a bacterial toxin which causes anthrax of animals inhibits the MAPK signaling by cleaving an N-terminal region of MAPKK (1–7 amino acids of human MAPKK1) (41Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K. Fukasawa K. Paull K.D. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1998; 280: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Since this region may contribute to the MAPK binding (28Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), the cleavage may prevent the complex formation between MAPKK and MAPK. Thus, it is likely that the complex formation between MAPKK and MAPK contributes to an increase in efficiency of the MAPKK-induced MAPK activation in normal signal transmission. In conclusion, our results here suggest that MAPKK is a key molecule in the Ras pathway, controlling both cell morphology and cell proliferation, and demonstrate an important regulatory role of the N-terminal region of MAPKK for the MAPK signaling. The results might also explain an underlying mechanism through which constitutive activation of the MAPK cascade alone can lead to cell transformation with typical morphological alterations.

Biochem. 1967; 36: 727-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 3Post R.L. Kume S. Tobin T. Orcutt B. Sen A.K. J. Gen.

Both ATPases consist of an α- and a β-subunit, which assemble with a 1:1 stoichiometry to form a stable heterodimer. The catalytic α1-subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase share a high degree of identity (63%), in contrast to their heavily glycosylated β1-subunits, which are structurally similar but only 30% identical. Assembly of the α- and β-subunits is important for conformational stability of the functional holoenzyme (5Ackermann U. Geering K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Tyagarajan K. Chow D.C. Smolka A. Forte J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This formation of a complex between α- and β-subunits is also essential for enzyme activity (7Noguchi S. Mishina M. Kawamura M. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Horowitz B. Eakle K.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Randolph G.R. Chen C.Y. Hitzeman R.A. Farley R.A. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Lemas et al. (11Lemas M.V. Takeyasu K. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20987-20991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the carboxyl-terminal 161 amino acids of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit are sufficient for assembly with the β-subunit. More recently, Colonna et al.(12Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) demonstrated that only four amino acids (SYGQ) in the extracellular loop between the predicted transmembrane helixes 7 and 8 are crucial for α-β subunit interactions. These four evolutionary conserved amino acids are also present in the β-subunit-binding region Arg898-Thr928 of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (13Melle-Milovanovic D. Milovanovic M. Nagpal S. Sachs G.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit containing Gln905-Val930 of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (including SYGQ) preferentially assembles with the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit. Many investigators have maintained that the extracellular domain as well as the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the β-subunit are important for assembly with the α-subunit (13Melle-Milovanovic D.

Eventually the enzymes are transported either to the plasma membrane (Na+,K+-ATPase) or to the tubulovesicles (H+,K+-ATPase). Elegant studies by Caplan and co-workers (24Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1304-G1313PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dunbar L.A. Roush D.L. Courtois-Country N. Muth T.R. Gottardi C.J. Rajendran V. Geibel J. Kashgarian M. Caplan M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In the cytoplasmic tail of the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit a functional endocytosis signal was found. The presence of this motif accounts for the returning of the pump from the apical cell membrane to its intracellular storage compartment resulting in inactivation of acid secretion (26Courtois-Coutry N.

Studies of the hybrid ATPase consisting of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit have sought to analyze the function of the β-subunit. This hybrid ATPase binds ouabain and transports cations across the membrane (27Eakle K.A. Kim K.S. Kabalin M.A. Farley R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2834-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Horisberger J. Jaunin P. Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S. Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Sachs G. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19131-19134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular region of the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit is probably responsible for the slightly higher apparent Na+affinity and the lower apparent K+ affinity of this hybrid compared with the Na+,K+-ATPase (20Eakle K.A. Kabalin M.A. Wang S.G. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6550-6557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Eakle K.A. Lyu R.M. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13937-13947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has been demonstrated that the predicted transmembrane segments 4, 5, and 6 are involved in cation occlusion (30Møller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 31Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The β-subunits of both enzymes probably participate in stabilizing this occluded cation intermediate (32Chow D.C. Browning C.M. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C39-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6737-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The question arises as to whether the complementary hybrid, consisting of the catalytic subunit of the H+,K+-ATPase and the β-subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase, also possesses catalytic activity. We therefore measured both the Na+,K+-ATPase activity and the H+,K+-ATPase activity for both hybrid ATPases. Furthermore, this study examines the possible role of β-subunits in the apparent K+ affinity of both K+-dependent ATPases. The rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA (9Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwe G.L.J. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was digested with BglII and ligated into the BamHI site of the pFastbacdual vector (HKα) (Life Technologies, Breda, The Netherlands). The β-subunit cDNA of the rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase (9Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwe G.L.J. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was digested withBamHI and ligated into the BbsI site of the pFastbacdual vector containing the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (HKαβ). The rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit cDNA (34Shull G.E. Schwartz A. Lingrel J.B. Nature. 1985; 316: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) HindIII fragment was ligated into the HindIII site of the pFastbacdual vector (NaKα, with a shortened multiple cloning site through aBamHI-XbaI deletion) or into the pFastbacdual vector (also with BamHI-XbaI deletion) containing the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit (NaKαHKβ). The sheep Na+,K+-ATPase β1-subunit cDNA (35Shull G.E. Lane L.K. Lingrel J.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was digested with SmaI and SpeI and ligated into the SmaI and NheI site of the pFastbacdual vector containing the Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit (NaKαβ) or into the XhoI and NheI site of the pFastbacdual vector containing the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (HKαNaKβ). All α-subunits were cloned downstream of the polyhedrin promoter, and all β-subunits downstream of the p10 promoter. As mock, the baculovirus DZ1, only expressing β-galactosidase, was used (9Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwe G.L.J. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Competent DH10bacEscherichia coli cells (Life Technologies, Breda, The Netherlands) harboring the baculovirus genome (bacmid) and a transposition helper vector, were transformed with the pFastbacdual transfer vector containing different cDNAs. Upon transition between the Tn7 sites in the transfer vector and the bacmid, recombinant bacmids were selected and isolated (36Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, insect Sf9 cells were transfected with recombinant bacmids using Cellfectin reagent (Life Technologies). After 3 days, the recombinant baculoviruses were harvested and used to infect Sf9 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Four days after infection, the amplified viruses were harvested. Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in 100-ml spinner flask cultures (9Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwe G.L.J. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For production of the ATPases subunits 1.0–1.5 × 106 cells/ml were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1–3 in Xpress medium (BioWittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 1% ethanol (37Klaassen C.H.W. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and incubated for 3 days. The Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, and resuspended at 0 °C in 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.0). The membranes were sonicated twice for 30 s at 60 W (Branson Power Co., Denbury, CT), after which the disrupted cells were centrifugated at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was recentrifugated at 100,000 ×g for 60 min and the pelleted membranes were resuspended in the above mentioned buffer and stored at −20 °C. Native H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase were isolated from the rat gastric mucosa and the sheep kidney outer medulla, respectively (38Swarts H.G.P. Van Uem T.J.F. Hoving S. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1070: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These tissues were homogenized and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pelleted membranes were resuspended in the above mentioned buffer and stored at −20 °C. Protein was determined with the modified Lowry method described by Peterson (39Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein samples from the membrane fraction were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on SDS gels containing 10% acrylamide according to Laemmli (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The α- and β-subunits of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase were detected with the polyclonal antibody HKB (41Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the monoclonal antibody 2G11 (42Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1562-C1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The α1- and β1-subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase were detected with the polyclonal antibody L25 (43Ning G. Maunsbach A.B. Lee Y.J. Møller J.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the monoclonal antibody M17-P5-F11 (44Sun Y. Ball W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1491-C1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The primary antibodies were detected using anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, which were labeled with peroxidase (DAKO A/S, Denmark). Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described (45Klaassen C.H.W. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Either 10 μg of monoclonal antibody 1F11 directed to the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (46De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Van Uem T.J.F. Klaassen C.H.W. Swarts H.G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) or 10 μl of the polyclonal serum L25 directed to the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (43Ning G. Maunsbach A.B. Lee Y.J. Møller J.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was added to 20 μl of protein A immobilized on agarose (50% (w/v), KemEnTec, Copenhagen, Denmark) and resuspended in 500 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (Fluka, Bornem, Belgium). This mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with constant agitation, after which the protein A immobilized on agarose was washed twice in the above mentioned buffer and once in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Crude membrane proteins (∼700 μg) were solubilized in 500 μl of buffer containing 1% (w/v) octaethylene glycol monododecylether (C12E8, Sigma), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 150 mm NaCl for 1 h at 4 °C. Following centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min, the supernatant was incubated with the antibodies bound to the protein A immobilized on agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation for a few seconds at 10,000 × g, washed 3 times in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE the ATPases subunits in the precipitates were identified by immunoblotting, using the biotin-labeled antibodies L25 (43Ning G. Maunsbach A.B. Lee Y.J. Møller J.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), M17-P5-F11 (44Sun Y. Ball W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1491-C1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 2G11 (42Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1562-C1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody HK9 was used for detection of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (47Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies labeled with biotin were detected using streptavidin labeled with peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), while HK9 was detected with anti-rabbit secondary antibody, which was also labeled with peroxidase (DAKO A/S, Denmark). The ATPase activity was determined with a radiochemical method (48Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7890-7895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For this purpose 0.6–7 μg of Sf9 membranes were added to 100 μl of medium, which contained 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). For determination of Na+,K+-ATPase activity, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01 mm ouabain (in order to inhibit endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase from Sf9 cells) were present. The specific activity is presented as the difference in activity with and without 10 mm KCl. In the incubation medium used for the measurements of the K+ activation curve only 10 mm NaCl was present. For determination of H+,K+-ATPase activity, 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 100–500 mCi mmol−1), 1 mm KCl, and 0.1 mmouabain were present. The specific activity is presented as the difference in activity with and without 0.1 mm SCH 28080. After incubation at 37 °C the reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 10% (w/v) charcoal in 6% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and after incubation at 0 °C the mixture was centrifuged for 30 s (10,000 × g). To 200 μl of the clear supernatant, containing the liberated inorganic phosphate (32Pi), 4 ml of OptiFluor (Canberra Packard, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was added and the mixture was analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis. Blanks were prepared by incubating in the absence of enzyme. ATP phosphorylation was determined as described (37Klaassen C.H.W. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Sf9 membranes (6–70 μg) were incubated at 0 °C in 25 mm Tris acetic acid (pH 6.0), 1 mm MgCl2 in a volume of 50 μl. For phosphorylation of Na+,K+-ATPase, 100 mm NaCl was added to the incubation buffer. This phosphorylation is presented as the difference with and without 10 mm KCl. Phosphorylation of H+,K+-ATPase is presented as the difference with and without 0.1 mm SCH 28080. After 30–60 min preincubation, 10 μl of 0.6 μm[γ-32P]ATP was added and incubated for 10 s at 0 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5% trichloroacetic acid in 0.1 m phosphoric acid and the phosphorylated protein was collected by filtration over a 0.8-μm membrane filter (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany). After repeated washing the filters were analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis. Phosphorylation at different ATP concentrations was performed at 21 °C and for Na+,K+-ATPase in the presence of 20 μg/ml oligomycin (a mixture of A, B, and C; Sigma). The K 0.5 value is defined as the concentration of effector (K+) giving the half-maximal activation and the IC50 as the value giving 50% inhibition of the maximal activation. Data are presented as mean values with standard error of the mean. Differences were tested for significance by means of the Student's t test. The cDNA clones of the H+,K+-ATPase α- and β-subunits and the rat and sheep cDNA clones of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1- and β1-subunits were provided by Drs. G. E. Shull and J. B. Lingrel, respectively. Cellfectin, competent DH10bac E. coli cells, and all enzymes used for DNA cloning were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol−1) was purchased from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). SCH 28080, kindly provided by Dr. A. Barnett, Schering-Plow, Kenilworth, NJ, was dissolved in ethanol and diluted to its final concentration of 0.1 mm in 0.2% ethanol. The antibodies 2G11 and M17-P5-F11 were gifts of Drs. J. Forte (Berkeley) and W. J. Ball Jr. (Cincinnati), respectively. Dr. J. V. Møller (Aarhus, Denmark) provided antibody L25 and Dr. M. Caplan (Yale) antibodies HKB and HK9. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing Na+,K+-ATPase, H+,K+-ATPase, their α-subunits, and their hybrids were produced and Sf9 cells were infected. The membrane fractions of these Sf9 cells expressing the recombinant proteins were isolated and Western blot analysis revealed comparable expression patterns (Fig. 1). Both Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase α-subunits detected with antibodies L25 (43Ning G. Maunsbach A.B. Lee Y.J. Møller J.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and HKB (41Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, had an apparent molecular mass of about 100 kDa. The antibody M17-P5-F11 (44Sun Y. Ball W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1491-C1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) visualized both a carbohydrate-free and a core-glycosylated form of the Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit. The monoclonal antibody 2G11 (42Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1562-C1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also recognized a carbohydrate-free and a core-glycosylated form of the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit. This carbohydrate-free form was of a similar molecular mass as the carbohydrate-free Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit, but the core-glycosylated Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit had a lower apparent molecular mass, due to the presence of three glycosylation sites in this subunit in contrast to the six glycosylation sites present in the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit. Interaction between the α- and β-subunits in both Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase is essential for a functionally active enzyme. To examine the interaction between α- and β-subunits in hybrid ATPases an immunoprecipitation assay was performed. The α-subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase were immunoprecipitated with antibodies L25 (43Ning G. Maunsbach A.B. Lee Y.J. Møller J.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and 1F11 (46De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Van Uem T.J.F. Klaassen C.H.W. Swarts H.G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), respectively. In control experiments both the Na+,K+-ATPase isolated from sheep kidney and recombinant Na+,K+-ATPase were precipitated with antibody L25. Similarly, rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase and recombinant H+,K+-ATPase were precipitated by antibody 1F11. With the native enzymes only glycosylated β-subunits were precipitated, with apparent molecular masses significantly higher than those of their recombinant counterparts. This is due to the absence of complex glycosylation in Sf9 cells. When the same method was used for the hybrid ATPases, both β-subunits were also coprecipitated with the other α-subunit (Fig. 2). This indicates that there is not only an interaction between the α- and β-subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase, but also between the α- and β-subunits of the two hybrid ATPases. Although quantification in these experiments is rather difficult, there seemed to be less coprecipitated β-subunits in the hybrid ATPases than in the wild type ATPases (NaKαβ, HKαβ). When HKαNaKβ was present during immunoprecipitation with antibody L25 (directed against the α-subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase), the β-subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase was unexpectedly precipitated. Also when the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was absent the Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit was precipitated (data not shown). In the absence of antibody L25 the Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit was not precipitated. These findings suggest that the expressed Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit assembles with the endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit. Antibody L25 apparently recognizes this endogenous α-subunit during immunoprecipitation, but not on a Western blot. The absence of unglycosylated β-subunit indicates that the assembly with the endogenous α-subunit only occurred during the early stage of infection, when the glycosylation machinery is still functional. Na+,K+-ATPase activity was measured in the presence of 100 μm ATP and optimal concentrations of Na+ (100 mm) and K+ (10 mm). Because of the endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase activity (50–100 nmol mg−1 protein h−1) present in the Sf9 membrane preparations, we determined the ouabain sensitivity for the endogenously present Na+,K+-ATPase in mock infected cells. The endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase activity was completely inhibited at 1 × 10−5m ouabain, while the recombinant activity was hardly inhibited at this concentration. These findings are in line with those of Lui and Guidotti (49Liu J.Y. Guidotti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 370-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Using 1 × 10−5m ouabain in the assay, we measured the recombinant ATPase activity as the difference between the activity with and without 10 mm K+ (Fig.3 A). The activity of NaKαHKβ was 12 ± 4% (n = 3) of the activity of NaKαβ. NaKα and mock infected cells did not show Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the presence of 10−5m ouabain. In order to measure K+-stimulated H+,K+-ATPase activity we used a suboptimal (10 μm) ATP concentration since at higher ATP concentrations the endogenous activity increases relatively more than the H+,K+-ATPase activity. The K+concentration (1 mm) used was optimal for H+,K+-ATPase activity under these conditions (50Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The hybrid HKαNaKβ showed an SCH 28080-sensitive ATPase activity which was 7 ± 1% (n = 3) of the HKαβ activity (Fig. 3 B). HKα and mock did not show any SCH 28080-sensitive ATPase activity. In conclusion, these hybrids possess only a fraction of the ATPase activity of Na+,K+-ATPase or H+,K+-ATPase when measured under similar conditions. To determine if this low ATPase activity of the hybrid ATPases could be due to changed ATP affinities, we measured the ATPase activity at different ATP concentrations (0.03–1 mm). The results are given in a Woolf-Augustinsson-Hofstee plot (Fig. 4). The intercept with the"

The current block by Zn2+ strongly depends on the external pH (pK a near 6.9), whereas the block by DEPC is rather independent of the pH in the range of 5.5 to 8.5. To identify the target sites of these reagents, we constructed a total of twelve cysteine- and/or histidine-replacement mutants, transfected tsA201 cells with them, and investigated the resulting whole-cell chloride currents.

Four mutants (C242A, C254A, H180A, and H451A) were slightly less sensitive to Zn2+ than WT.

Günther W. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The first membrane topology model of ClC proteins was derived from hydropathy analysis (2Jentsch T.J.

Pharmacol. 1996; 128: 195-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) lead to myotonia, a disease characterized by muscle stiffness. The study of such myotonia-causing mutations provided first insights into the relationships between the primary sequence and the functions of this channel (7Fahlke Ch. Rüdel R. Mitrovic N. Zhou M. George Jr., A.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Fahlke Ch. Beck C.L. George Jr., A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Strong evidence suggests regions between transmembrane segments D3 and the end of D5 to participate in the pore-forming structure (11Fahlke C. Yu H.T. Beck C.L. Rhodes T.H. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, these results are not in agreement with the most recently postulated topology model of ClC-1 (5Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7633-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies of ClC-0 (reviewed in Ref. 1Jentsch T.J. Günther W. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), a homologous chloride channel in the electric organ of Torpedo, led to the suggestion of additional protein parts being involved in forming the ion conducting pathway. ClC channels most likely consist of two subunits (12Fahlke Ch. Knittle T. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. George Jr., A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and in the case of ClC-0, each subunit was proposed to contain a single pore (4Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13189-13198Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar,14Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Recent evidence speaks against this “double-barreled” channel model, at least in the case of ClC-1 (15Fahlke C. Rhodes T.H. Desai R.R. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have found earlier that the exposure of hClC-1, stably expressed in HEK-293 cells, to 1 mm Zn2+ leads to a massive reduction of the conducted chloride current (16Kürz L.L. Wagner S. George Jr., A.L. Rüdel R. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 433: 357-363PubMed Google Scholar). The results were compatible with the presence of at least two extracellularly accessible zinc-binding sites and a direct effect on ion permeation,e.g. by obstruction of the pore. The histidyl-reactive diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), applied from the outside, also reduced the currents through hClC-1. The aim of this study was to identify the target residues for these blockers and, thereby, to draw inferences regarding the membrane topology and the potential location of pore-forming structures. It is known from other proteins, that Zn2+ binding sites are often made up of several and possibly different amino acid side chains (17Tainer J.A. Roberts V.A. Getzoff E.D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1991; 2: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because these residues (histidine, cysteine, or acidic amino acids) can be distant on the primary sequence but close in space, we also hoped that their identification would provide us with the first three-dimensional information on the ClC-1 protein. Therefore, we individually replaced candidate cysteine and histidine residues with alanine, expressed the mutants in tsA201 cells, and characterized their sensitivity toward the blocking agents. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a polymerase chain reaction-based kit (QuikChange, Stratagene). Mutant constructs contained in the expression vector pRc/CMV were used for transfection of tsA201 cells as described (18Wagner S. Deymeer F. Kürz L.L. Benz S. Schleithoff L. Lehmann-Horn F. Serdaroglu P. Özdemir C. Rüdel R. Muscle Nerve. 1998; 21: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transient transfection was achieved using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (19Graham R.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) with ∼0.01 μg of plasmid DNA per 3–5 × 103 cells/cm2. To detect cells expressing recombinant mutant clones after transfection, the tsA201 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the CD8 antigen and incubated with polystyrene microbeads coated with anti-CD8 antibody (Dynabeads M-450 CD8, Dynal GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) 3 min before electrophysiological characterization. Two to three days after transfection, standard whole-cell recordings were performed, using an EPC-7 amplifier (List, Darmstadt, Germany). Only cells to which microbeads had bound were used. For measurements of WT currents, a stably transfected HEK-293 cell line was used (16Kürz L.L. Wagner S. George Jr., A.L. Rüdel R. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 433: 357-363PubMed Google Scholar) or tsA201 cells were transiently transfected as described for the mutants. No differences were observed with these two types of cells regarding electrophysiological characteristics or blocker sensitivity. The standard external solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For variation of pH, HEPES was substituted on an equimolar basis with MES for pH 5.5–6.7 and with AMPSO for pH 8.0–8.5. The recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and were heat polished. They had resistances between 1.0 and 2.0 mΩ when filled with standard internal solution (130 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). More than 60% of the series resistance was compensated for by an analog procedure. Linear leakage or capacitive currents were not subtracted. The currents were filtered using the 3-kHz filter of the amplifier and sampled at various rates. For recording and analysis of experimental data, a combination of three programs (pCLAMP, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA; Excel, Microsoft, Unterschleissheim, Germany; SigmaPlot, Jandel Scientific, San Raphael, CA) was used. Differences of current reduction were tested for statistical significance (p < 0.05) using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test (GraphPad InStat, San Diego, CA). All data are shown as mean ± S.E. The pH-dependence as well as concentration dependences of Zn2+ block were fitted with logistic functions yielding estimates of IC50, pK a, and Hill coefficients. To determine the voltage dependence of activation, instantaneous tail current amplitudes at −105 mV were normalized to the extrapolated maximum value and plotted versus the test pulse potential, yielding the voltage dependence of the relative open probability,P open (16Kürz L.L. Wagner S. George Jr., A.L. Rüdel R. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 433: 357-363PubMed Google Scholar). The data were fitted with a single Boltzmann term plus a voltage-independent value:I(V) = A·(1 + exp[(V− V 0.5)/Kv])−1+ constant. ZnCl2 (Sigma Chemical Co., Deisenhofen, Germany) was prepared as a 100 mm stock solution in standard external solution and diluted prior to the experiments. All visible precipitates were eliminated by adding sufficient HCl; no pH change was noted after dilution. DEPC (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) was stored desiccated at 4 °C to minimize decomposition by hydrolysis. A 200-mM stock solution in absolute ethanol was freshly prepared every day, kept on ice, and diluted with standard external solution immediately before use. Stock solutions were added to the bath in the appropriate amounts, or else the cells were superfused with the indicated reagent solution. To study the pH dependence, the cells were exposed to bathing solutions of the desired pH, followed by application of the blocking agent. First we tested the effect of external pH on WT current block by external application of Zn2+ and DEPC. From the pK a and Hill coefficient of such titration curves, we hoped to infer the most likely sort and number of residues participating in the block. Changes of pH alone have profound effects on the gating of hClC-1, whereas outward current amplitudes do not change considerably (20Fahlke Ch. Rosenbohm A. Mitrovic N. George A.L.J. Rüdel R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 695-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Astill D.S. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 423-435Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Block of whole-cell currents was tested by applying repetitive pulses to +50 mV (for maximum channel activation), followed by a hyperpolarizing step at −125 mV to monitor the deactivation time course (Fig.1 A). Block by 1 mmZn2+ (registered at +50 mV) showed a strong pH dependence (Fig. 1 B). At pH 6.0, the current amplitudes were unaffected, whereas at pH 7.4, the block was almost complete. The apparent pK a of the resultant titration curve was 6.9, and the Hill coefficient was 3.0. In contrast, the effect of 1 mm DEPC was practically independent of pH over the range tested, pH 5.5–8.5. According to the topology model of Schmidt-Rose and Jentsch (Ref. 5Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7633-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar; see Fig.2 A), the cysteine residues at positions 242, 254, 271, 481, and 546, and the histidine residues at positions 237, 436, 451, 538, and 555 are potentially accessible from the extracellular environment. To test whether binding of Zn2+ to either of these residues is involved in the observed block, we individually replaced each of these residues by alanine. Positions Cys-179 and His-180 were included in this test because an alternative model placed D2 instead of D4 at the outside (Ref. 4Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13189-13198Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar; not shown in figure). All mutants were functional when expressed in tsA201 cells, and the conducted whole-cell currents were not substantially different from WT currents. They were of similar amplitude and showed the typical deactivation in response to hyperpolarizing pulses as well as inward rectification (Fig. 3). In the case of the cysteine mutants C179A, C271A, and C481A, the amount of chloride current block exerted by 1 mm Zn2+ was very similar to that in WT (Fig.4 A). In contrast, block was almost absent with C546A (current reduction only by 17% instead of 83% in WT). Moderate changes (current reduction by 66–67%) were observed in the case of mutants C242A and C254A. These residues are located in segment D4 (see Fig. 2). The location of this segment is yet unclear, as evidence based on substituted cysteine accessibility suggests it to face (at least in part) the cytoplasm (11Fahlke C. Yu H.T. Beck C.L. Rhodes T.H. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas topology studies predict it to be extracellular (5Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7633-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, residues following the C-terminal end of D3 (designated P1) and in D5 have been identified to participate in the pore-forming structure (11Fahlke C. Yu H.T. Beck C.L. Rhodes T.H. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To test further whether Zn2+ binds to Cys-242 and Cys-254, we constructed a double mutant (C242A/C254A) and investigated its susceptibility to Zn2+ blockade. In standard solutions the electrophysiological characteristics of the double mutant resembled that of WT (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of 1 mmZn2+, the chloride currents were only decreased by 33% (instead of 83% in WT), confirming the putative capabilities of these two cysteines to bind extracellularly applied Zn2+ and thereby establish channel blockade. When mutants H436A, H538A, and H555A were in the same way externally exposed to 1 mm Zn2+, reduction of current was about the same as with WT (Fig. 4 B). Currents through the mutants H180A and H451A were slightly less blocked by Zn2+(statistically significant) and, interestingly, in the case of H237A, Zn2+ was able to block the chloride currents even by 6% more than in WT. Also, the time course of block was markedly faster in this case (data not shown). To test for a possible role of His-180 and His-451 in the blocking effect of Zn2+, we expressed the mutant H180A/H451A, and additionally C242A/C254A/H180A/H451A, to possibly destroy the binding site completely. The double histidine mutant showed a very similar sensitivity toward Zn2+ as the two corresponding single mutants (block by ∼70%), whereas for the quadruple mutant, it was about as much as with the double mutant C242A/C254A (block by ∼33%). This suggests that the two histidine residues are not involved in the blockade exerted by Zn2+. To further investigate the changes in Zn2+ block observed for C242A, C254A, and C546A, we measured current block of these three mutants at different Zn2+ concentrations. In addition, the double mutant C242A/C254A and the triple mutant C242A/C254A/C546A were also studied. The resulting curves are depicted in Fig.5. The different degrees of Zn2+ sensitivity already indicated by the values obtained for 1 mm Zn2+ was fully confirmed. Whereas for WT, an IC50 value close to 200 μm was obtained, it took ∼700–800 μm Zn2+ to produce half-maximal block of the single cysteine mutants C242A and C254A and ∼1200 μm for the corresponding double mutant. The IC50 value for C546A was even larger (∼1900 μm), and after removal of all three cysteines, a value fifty times that of WT was obtained (∼9200 μm). The Hill coefficient was around 2.6 for WT, and it ranged from 1.6 to 2.5 for the single and double mutants. In the case of the triple mutant, the value was reduced to 0.9. We also tested the responses of all histidine mutants to extracellularly applied 1 mm DEPC. This reagent preferably modifies histidine residues by covalent binding of the carbethoxy group to the unprotonated imidazole ring, although modification of other amino acids has been described (22Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The chloride currents through H180A, H436A, and H451A were blocked by a similar degree as in cells containing WT channels (47%, Fig. 4 C). Block appeared stronger for mutants H237A, H538A, and H555A (63%, 63%, and 74%, respectively), but the difference was significant only for the latter residue. All 14 mutants that we have investigated were functional and showed electrophysiological characteristics resembling those of WT channels. Thus, we can presume that the structural integrity of the channel protein was preserved in each case. With mutants C242A, C254A, and C546A, the zinc block of the chloride current was smaller than with WT. This suggests that the three cysteines Cys-242, Cys-254, and Cys-546 are involved in the binding of Zn2+, creating this effect. This result is surprising in so far as the apparent pK a value of the Zn2+ titration curve (pK a = 6.9, Fig.1 B) suggests that a histidine side chain (pK a ≈ 6–7) rather than a cysteine (pK a ≈ 8–9 in proteins) is the relevant target site. Studies on the pH dependence of ClC-1 current block by Cd2+, another group IIb cation with behavior similar to that of Zn2+, yielded a pK a value of 6.8, i.e. nearly identical to ours (23Rychkov G.Y. Astill D.S. Bennetts B. Hughes B.P. Bretag A.H. Roberts M.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 355-362Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The authors of that study suggested that histidine residues might be involved. On the other hand, considerable pK a shifts of titratable groups are not uncommon in proteins, e.g. in our case because of the presence of a positive charge close to the cysteine thiol. None of the investigated histidine mutants showed a decreased sensitivity toward the histidine-selective reagent DEPC. This could either mean that DEPC has its target site located at a different position or that it exerts its effect by some unspecific mechanism. The apparent lack of pH dependence of the DEPC effect does not allow one to distinguish between these two possibilities. Because the zinc blockade of WT channels can only be exerted by external application of the metal ion (16Kürz L.L. Wagner S. George Jr., A.L. Rüdel R. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 433: 357-363PubMed Google Scholar), cysteines 242, 254, and 546 must be accessible from the extracellular environment. The finding that the gating parameters were unchanged (16Kürz L.L. Wagner S. George Jr., A.L. Rüdel R. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 433: 357-363PubMed Google Scholar) also led us to assume that Zn2+ might exert its blockade by a direct effect on chloride permeation, e.g. by occlusion of the pore. Thus, the three cysteine residues are presumably located in or near the pore region of the channel. The degree of zinc block was markedly diminished in the case of C546A, and only moderately in the case of the other two mutants. Hence, Cys-546 might be closer to the pore than Cys-242 and Cys-254. The latter two cysteines certainly influence the passage of chloride through the pore when Zn2+ is bound because the double mutant C242A/C254A is clearly less sensitive toward Zn2+ as each of the single mutants alone. Cysteines 242 and 254 are located in the D4 segment, and the residues in and around this region have indeed been postulated to form the channel-lining structure (11Fahlke C. Yu H.T. Beck C.L. Rhodes T.H. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, when positions 237, 244, 265, and 267 were mutated to cysteines, they were only accessible to internally applied methanethiosulfonate reagents (11Fahlke C. Yu H.T. Beck C.L. Rhodes T.H. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore Fahlkeet al. (11Fahlke C. Yu H.T. Beck C.L. Rhodes T.H. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) suggested D4 to be located at the inside of the membrane (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, Schmidt-Rose and Jentsch (5Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7633-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), using glycosylation scanning and protease protection assays, proposed D4 to be located on the extracellular side of the membrane. At first glance, our results seem to speak in favor of the latter model. In addition, the absence of a voltage dependence of the Zn2+ blockade (16Kürz L.L. Wagner S. George Jr., A.L. Rüdel R. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 433: 357-363PubMed Google Scholar) and the fact that the ClC-1 pore is forming an anion-selective channel lets the possibility of Zn2+ penetrating this channel seem unlikely. However, positively charged methanethiosulfonate reagents were able to reach cysteine residues within the putative pore (11Fahlke C. Yu H.T. Beck C.L. Rhodes T.H. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and very recent findings imply binding sites for internally applied Cd2+ at some of these positions (15Fahlke C. Rhodes T.H. Desai R.R. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, work on the GABA receptor, a chloride channel which is also Zn2+-sensitive, led to the proposal that Zn2+ is gaining access to the anion channel lumen, possibly in the form of the complex (ZnCl)42− (24Wooltorton J.R. McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 633-640Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The conformation and orientation of the region between D3 and D5 might also be more complex,e.g. looping through the membrane, and thereby exposing parts of it to the outside and the inside. Thus, more experimental data are needed to unambiguously assign a certain topology to this area of the protein and to elucidate the pore-lining structure. Another intriguing observation is that Zn2+ block of H237A seemed to be stronger (and faster, data not shown) than in the case of WT, although the difference was not statistically significant. The histidine side chain at this position has been proposed to line the channel lumen (11Fahlke C. Yu H.T. Beck C.L. Rhodes T.H. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1997; 390: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 15Fahlke C. Rhodes T.H. Desai R.R. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). By substituting it with the smaller, uncharged alanine side chain, the access for Zn2+ toward its actual target sites (one or more of the three cysteines) nearby might be facilitated. The same argument could explain the somewhat stronger block of mutant H555A by DEPC (Fig. 4 C). The amount of block effected by Zn2+ in mutants H180A and H451A is similar to that in mutants C242A and C254A. This led us initially to think of a motif found in some zinc finger proteins: two histidine and two cysteine residues surrounding a Zn2+ ion in a tetrahedral arrangement (25Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). After removal of one of the binding partners, Zn2+ might still be able to bind but with a lower affinity. The lack of any additional blocking influence of the two histidine mutants in the double mutant H180A/H451A and in the construct C242A/C254A/H180A/H451A, however, argues against their potential involvement in Zn2+ binding. The mutation producing the largest difference in Zn2+sensitivity was C546A. The proposed extracellular accessibility of residue Cys-546 is in agreement with results suggesting that position Leu-549 is also accessible from the exterior (5Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7633-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ClC-0 mutations situated before and at the end of D12 result in altered permeation properties, implying a possible participation of these regions in forming the channel-lining structure (5Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7633-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Ludewig U. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 498: 691-702Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is unclear yet whether Cys-242, Cys-254, and Cys-546 participate in the same binding site although the Hill coefficient (3.0) of the titration curve seems suggestive. The substitution of all three residues in the triple mutant C242A/C254A/C546A results in a channel which is almost insensitive to Zn2+ blockade. The Hill coefficient (∼0.9) implies a loss of cooperativity and the removal of one or more binding sites compared with WT (∼2.6). In light of the new evidence indicating that ClC-1 has a single pore (15Fahlke C. Rhodes T.H. Desai R.R. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), binding sites made up of corresponding cysteines from both subunits are also plausible. We thank M. Arnold, E. Fuchs, and T. Hiller for excellent technical assistance."

Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3355-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The rho protein contains an ATPase-dependent helicase activity that can separate the strands of an RNA-DNA duplex. Transcription termination by rho starts after the rho protein binds to the nascent RNA transcript at a cytosine-rich entry site (5Geiselmann J. Wang Y. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7754-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The RNA binding event activates the ATPase activity of rho, which is believed to fuel a directional 5′ → 3′ movement of the protein along the nascent RNA chain. Both the ATPase and the helicase activities are necessary for the rho-dependent termination event (6Brennan C.A. Steinmetz E.J. Spear P. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5440-5447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that translocation and RNA-DNA duplex unwinding activities cause disruption of the elongating complex, which results in transcription termination (7Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell. 1987; 48: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 8Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol.

Several studies of the rho protein have shown that it assembles into a planar hexagonal structure that contains a central hole (10Gogol E.P. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. Gill S.C. Calmettes P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The self-association of rho subunits into a hexamer is reversible in solution, and stable hexamer is formed in the presence of ATP and/or RNA (12Finger L.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Seifried S.E. Bjornson K.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each subunit of rho hexamer contains two functionally distinct domains, an ATP- and an RNA-binding domain (1Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding domain of rho shows greater than 50% amino acid sequence homology to the β subunit of F1-ATPase (14Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 815-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of the RNA-binding domain of rho is also very similar to the N-terminal domain of F1-ATPase, despite little amino acid sequence homology between these domains of the two proteins (15Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A recent report has also shown similarities among the ATPase mechanism of rho, the F1-ATPase, and T7 DNA helicase (23Hingorani M.M. Washington M.T. Moore K.C. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5012-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 24Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These observations support the proposal that the structure of the rho hexamer is likely to be similar to that of the F1-ATPase (14Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 815-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct.

Several studies in the literature indicate that the rho hexamer is not symmetrical. Geiselmann et al.(17Geiselmann J. Seifried S.E. Yager T.D. Liang C. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggested a D3 symmetry for the rho hexamer, and recently Horiguchiet al.(18Horiguchi T. Miwa Y. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 514-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using extensive chemical cross-linking experiments, have suggested a C3 or a C3/6symmetry for the rho quaternary geometry. Equilibrium nucleotide binding experiments have shown that the rho hexamer binds only three ATP molecules with a high affinity (19Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Others have shown that in addition to these high affinity sites, there are three low affinity ATP binding sites on rho (20Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Seifried S.E. Easton J.B. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10454-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, rho protein falls into the class of hexameric helicases, such as the E. coliDnaB (22Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5888-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and T7 DNA helicase (23Hingorani M.M. Washington M.T. Moore K.C. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5012-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that were shown to contain two classes of nucleotide binding sites. The three tight nucleotide binding sites on T7 DNA helicase hexamer were shown to be noncatalytic, with properties similar to such sites of the F1-ATPase protein. Because rho protein is structurally similar to the F1-ATPase protein, we have investigated the possibility of noncatalytic sites on the rho hexamer. Our results show that the two classes of nucleotide binding sites on rho catalyze ATPase turnover at different rates. The ATPase turnover rate at one class of nucleotide binding sites was about 1500 times slower than the turnover rate at the other sites. These studies allow a better understanding of the nature of the two classes of nucleotide binding sites on the rho hexamer. We propose that the three tight nucleotide binding sites on the rho hexamer are noncatalytic, serving a role similar to such sites of the F1-ATPase and T7 DNA helicase, and that the weak sites are the catalytic sites. Rho protein was overexpressed in E. colistrain HB101 carrying the rho overexpression plasmid pKS26 (25Mori H. Imai M. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and purified according to Finger and Richardson (26Finger L.R. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 20: 1640-1645Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, protein extracts from heat-induced cells were subjected to fractionation with Polymin P, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and successive chromatography on SP-Sepharose FF and heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The final preparation was stored at −20 °C in rho storage buffer containing 50% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Rho protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.325 (mg/ml)−1cm−1 (11Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. Gill S.C. Calmettes P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ATP and RNA homopolymers (poly(C) and poly(U)) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Poly(C) RNA had a reporteds 20,w value of 7.1 in 0.015m NaCl, 0.0015 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0, with an average length of 420 bases. Poly(U) had ans 20,w value of 6.0, with an average length of 290 bases. Poly(C) RNA concentration was determined by UV absorption at 269 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 6200m−1 cm−1 for the cytosine base, and poly(U) RNA concentration at 260 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 9350 m−1 cm−1 for uracil base. These RNAs were dissolved in TE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA) and used without further purification. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and their purity was assessed by polyethyleneimine (PEI)1-cellulose TLC and corrected for in all experiments. The ATP-regenerating reagents, phosphocreatine and creatine kinase, were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Equilibrium binding of ATP to rho was measured using the nitrocellulose membrane binding assay. The nitrocellulose membrane circles (25 mm) were treated with 0.5 n NaOH, rinsed extensively with water, and equilibrated in the membrane wash buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) before use. The reaction (15 μl) contained 0.5–500 μm radiolabeled ATP ([α-32P]ATP) in binding buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Rho protein was added to a final concentration of 1.0 μm (hexamer) and the reactions were incubated for 30 s at 18 °C. 12 μl of samples were then filtered through the nitrocellulose membrane assembly. The membranes were washed with 0.5 ml of wash buffer before and after filtration. 1-μl aliquots of each sample were spotted on a separate nitrocellulose membrane to quantitate total ATP. The radioactivity on the membrane was quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The molar amount of ATP bound to each rho hexamer was determined and plotted versusATP concentration. The resulting titration data were fit using a hyperbolic equation to obtain the apparent K d, the equilibrium dissociation constant of rho ATP complex. The ATPase activity of rho protein was measured at 18 °C. The rho protein was incubated in the ATPase reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol and 10% (v/v) glycerol) in the presence of the indicated amount of poly(C) or poly(U) RNA. Trace amounts of a >90% pure [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), together with nonradioactive ATP (1.0–3.0 mm), were added to start the reaction (30–50-μl reaction volumes). At various times, aliquots (5 μl) were withdrawn and quenched with 10 μl of 1 m HCl and 20 μl of chloroform. Quenched reactions were neutralized by adding 1 m NaOH, 0.25 m Tris base (about 9 μl), and 1 μl of the quenched reactions was spotted on a PEI-cellulose thin layer chromatography plate (Whatman). The radioactive ATP and Pi were separated using 0.3m potassium phosphate, pH 3.4, as the chromatography running buffer. The ATP and Pi spots were quantitated using the PhosphorImager. The initial rates of Pi formation were determined from plots of molar amounts of Pi versus time of reaction. Either [γ-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ATP was used in this experiment. All the nucleotide exchange experiments were carried out in an 18 °C room. Rho protein (0.276 mg/ml, 1.0 μm rho hexamer) was pre-incubated in the ATPase reaction buffer with a mixture of nonradioactive ATP (1.0 mm) and radioactive ATP for less than 10 s, either in the absence or in the presence of RNA. The reaction mixture was subsequently chased with nonradioactive ATP (10 mm in the same buffer as above). At defined intervals after addition of the chase ATP, 10–15-μl aliquots were removed and filtered through pre-wetted nitrocellulose membrane filters. 1 μl of each sample was spotted on a separate nitrocellulose membrane to quantify the total ATP. Nonspecific binding of ATP to the nitrocellulose filters was measured by replacing rho protein with buffer and corrected in all experiments. The resulting nucleotide binding/exchange data were fit using nonlinear regression analysis (SigmaPlot) to obtain the dissociation rate of rho-bound nucleotides. The chemical form of the nucleotides bound to rho was identified by extracting the nitrocellulose membrane filters with 0.5 mperchloric acid, neutralizing with 0.25 m Tris, 1m NaOH, and analyzing the extracted nucleotides by PEI-cellulose TLC. To investigate the interaction of rho protein with ATP and to determine the number of ATPs bound to rho at equilibrium, we have used nitrocellulose filter binding assay. A constant amount of rho protein was titrated with increasing amounts of [α-32P]ATP, and the rho-bound ATP was separated from free ATP by filtration through nitrocellulose membranes. As shown in Fig. 1, three ATP molecules were bound to rho at high ATP concentrations. The apparent K d of rho-ATP complex was determined to be 17 μm. These results are consistent with studies that show that although rho has six identical ATP binding sites, rho binds only three ATPs at equilibrium (19Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Seifried S.E. Easton J.B. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10454-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ATPs bound to the weak sites are not easily detectable by this membrane filtration method, possibly because these ATPs dissociate during the filtration and washing steps. We then explored the possibility of noncatalytic sites on rho. We designed experiments to determine whether the ATPs bound at the tight sites were catalytically competent. The experiment consisted of measuring the dissociation rate of nucleotides bound to the tight sites (k off) and comparing this value to the ATPase turnover rate, k cat. If the tight sites are catalytically competent, then the k off should be equal to or faster than the steady state k cat. If the k off from these sites is slower than thek cat, then the ATPs bound to the tight sites cannot be catalytically competent and are likely to be noncatalytic. The rho-catalyzed ATPase turnover rate was measured at 18 °C in the presence of poly(C) or poly(U) RNA. The concentrations of RNA and ATP were kept at saturating values; thus the measured velocity would be the V max value, which, divided by the rho hexamer concentration, provided thek cat. Table Ilists the k cat values obtained in the presence of poly(C) and poly(U) RNAs. In the presence of poly(C) RNA, the ATPasek cat was close to 30 mol of ATP hydrolyzed per s per rho hexamer. Under the same conditions, the poly(U)-stimulated ATPase k cat was only 7.2 mol of ATP hydrolyzed per s per rho hexamer. This rate appears to be lower because of the weaker affinity of rho for the poly(U) RNA. Accordingly, the ATPasek cat increased to 11.4 mol of ATP hydrolyzed per s per rho hexamer when the poly(U) RNA was increased to 0.33 μg/μl.Table IRNA-stimulated ATPase turnover rates measured at 18 °CRNA cofactorPoly(C), 420 ntant, nucleotides.Poly(U), 290 ntPoly(U), 290 ntATP (mm)bThe poly(C) RNA-stimulated ATPase K m is 29 μm (data not shown).1.01.01.0RNA (μm)0.130.203.3Rho hexamer (μm)0.10.10.1(RNA/rho hexamer) molar ratio1.32.033ATPase rate:(mol ADP/s/mol rho hexamer)30.2 ± (2.5)7.2 ± (1.8)11.4 ± (1.2)a nt, nucleotides.b The poly(C) RNA-stimulated ATPase K m is 29 μm (data not shown). Open table in a new tab The following experiment was designed to determine the dissociation rate of the three nucleotides bound to the rho protein at equilibrium. As shown in Scheme FSI, the experiment consisted of preincubating a complex of rho and RNA with radioactive ATP and then chasing the complex with an excess of nonradioactive ATP. The radioactive nucleotide bound to rho after various chase times were quantitated by the nitrocellulose filter binding assay. The results of such an experiment with poly(C) RNA and [α-32P]ATP are shown in Fig.2 A. Before chase was added, there were about 3 nucleotides bound per rho hexamer (Fig.2 A). After chase was added, all of the α-32P-labeled nucleotides dissociated from the rho protein with a single exponential rate of 0.02 ± 0.002 s−1 (Fig. 2 A). A similar nucleotide binding/exchange experiment, in the presence of poly(U) RNA at 0.2 μg/μl, provided a 10-fold faster nucleotide dissociation rate constant of 0.15 ± 0.02 s−1 (Fig. 2 B). When the poly(U) concentration was increased about 16-fold, the dissociation rate decreased to the same level as observed with poly(C) RNA (0.033 ± 0.005 s−1 at 3.3 μg/μl of poly(U) RNA). When the experiment was carried out in the absence of RNA (Fig.2 C), 3–4 nucleotides were bound to rho at equilibrium, in the absence of the chase. After chase was added, the α-32P-labeled nucleotides dissociated from the rho hexamer at a rate that was too fast to measure manually.Figure 2Dissociation kinetics of rho-bound α-32P-labeled nucleotides. The dissociation rate of radioactive nucleotides bound to rho was measured in the absence and in the presence of poly(C) and poly(U) RNAs at 18 °C as shown in SchemeFSI. A, rho protein (1.0 μm, hexamer) and poly(C) RNA (0.2 μg/μl) were preincubated and mixed with [α-32P]ATP (1.0 mm) for about 7 s before nonradioactive ATP (10 mm) was added as a chase. After varying chase times (10–400 s), rho-bound radioactive nucleotide was quantitated by nitrocellulose membrane binding assay. In the presence of poly(C) RNA, a total of 3.1 ± 0.48 nucleotides (error calculated from five independent measurements) were bound to rho before chase was added (shown as ● at zero chase time). After ATP chase was added, the rho-bound nucleotides dissociated with an exponential rate constant of 0.02 ± 0.002 s−1 (○). Bshows the dissociation kinetics of rho-bound α-32P-labeled nucleotides in the presence of two different poly(U) RNA concentrations (0.2 μg/μl, shown as ■, and 3.3 μg/μl, shown as ○). About 3–4 nucleotides were bound to the rho hexamer at both RNA concentrations before ATP chase was added (shown as ▪, ●). The three rho-bound nucleotides dissociated with a rate constant of 0.15 ± 0.02 s−1 (■) in the presence of 0.2 μg/μl RNA and 0.033 ± 0.005 s−1(○) in the presence of 3.3 μg/μl poly(U) RNA. C, in the absence of RNA, a total of 4.2 ± 0.54 nucleotides were bound per rho hexamer before chase was added (shown as ▪). After ATP chase was added, the rho-bound nucleotides dissociated at a rate that was too fast to manually measure (■).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Table II compares thek off values of rho-bound nucleotides and the rho-catalyzed ATPase turnover rates. In the presence of poly(C) RNA, the k off of the three tight nucleotides was about 1500 times slower than the ATPase turnover rate. In the presence of poly(U) RNA, the k off of the nucleotides was 50–340 times slower than the ATPase turnover rate. Thus thek off of the tightly bound nucleotides was consistently slower than the RNA-stimulated ATPase turnover rate. These results indicate that the nucleotides bound at the three tight sites on the rho hexamer do not participate in the fast ATPase turnover.Table IIComparison of the ATPase turnover rate and the rho-bound nucleotide dissociation rateRNAATPase rateaThe steady-state ATPase turnover rates are taken from Table I.Off-rate,k offbOff-rates of rho-bound nucleotides were obtained from the dissociation kinetic experiments shown in Fig. 2.Ratio (k cat/k off)mol ADP/s/mol rho hexamernucleotide dissociation/s/rho hexamerPoly(C)30.2 ± 2.50.02 ± 0.0021,510Poly(U)11.4 ± 1.20.033 ± 0.005345Poly(U)7.2 ± 1.80.15 ± 0.0248No RNA∼0.001≥0.15a The steady-state ATPase turnover rates are taken from Table I.b Off-rates of rho-bound nucleotides were obtained from the dissociation kinetic experiments shown in Fig. 2. Open table in a new tab The above experiments indicated that the ATPs bound at the tight sites exchanged very slowly with solution ATP. The next question was whether the tightly bound nucleotides were ATP or ADP. In other words, does ATP get hydrolyzed at these tight sites? Two experiments were designed to determine the identity (ATP versusADP) of the slowly exchanging nucleotides. These experiments were carried out in the presence of poly(C) RNA. Essentially the same experiment described above and shown in Fig. 2 A was performed with [α-32P]ATP. After various chase times, the nitrocellulose membrane that contained the rho-bound radioactive nucleotide was extracted, and the nucleotides were analyzed by PEI-cellulose TLC. As shown in Fig. 3, this experiment showed that most of the nucleotides bound to rho both before and after addition of the chase were ADP. The total amount of rho-bound ADP decreased with increasing chase time, as expected. A control experiment (Fig. 3, lane 9) showed that about one- third of the radioactive ATP was hydrolyzed with rho and RNA during the <10-s preincubation period. Therefore, the ATP substrate was not exhausted during the preincubation period, and the rho-bound radioactive ADP did not result from rebinding of radioactive ADP from solution. Similarly, we also determined that the acid extraction procedure resulted in less than 7% hydrolysis of ATP to ADP (Fig. 3,lane 11). The above results indicate that the tight sites are capable of hydrolyzing ATP, but the hydrolysis product dissociates from the tight sites at a slow rate. To confirm these results, a second nucleotide binding/exchange experiment was carried out with [γ-32P]ATP instead of [α-32P]ATP. If the ATPs are hydrolyzed at the tight nucleotide binding sites of rho and if the radioactive Pidoes not remain tightly bound, then we should observe no detectable radioactivity on the nitrocellulose membranes in the nucleotide binding/chase experiment with [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 4, we observed radioactivity bound to rho which corresponded to about one site per hexamer, before chase was added. This radioactivity was lost after addition of the chase with the same slow rate constant of 0.02 s−1 as observed in the [α-32P]ATP experiment. Because the radiolabel on ATP is in the γ position, the slowly exchanging species must be ATP or Pi. Moreover, because the nucleotide identification experiment had shown very little rho-bound ATP at the tight sites, we conclude that about 30% Pi is tightly bound to rho, either as free Pi or in a complex with ADP, such as ADP·Pi. Results thus far suggested that the ATPase turnover at the noncatalytic sites was about 1500 times slower than the ATPase turnover at the catalytic sites. We wanted to investigate whether there was cooperativity between the catalytic and noncatalytic ATPase sites of rho. To this end, we measured the ATPase turnover at the noncatalytic sites by measuring the k off of nucleotides from the tight sites under two conditions. In one experiment, we measured the k off under reaction conditions where active hydrolysis of ATP was not occurring at the catalytic sites. In a second experiment, we measured the k off under reaction conditions where hydrolysis was occurring at the catalytic sites. To satisfy the first condition, a mixture of rho protein and RNA was incubated with a lower concentration of [α-32P]ATP (0.3 mm). Because of the lower ATP concentration, most of the ATP was hydrolyzed with RNA in the 2-min period before nonradioactive ATP chase was added, as shown in Fig. 5(inset). Under these conditions, there were less than three radioactive nucleotides bound to rho at the tight sites, and these nucleotides dissociated at a rate that was too fast to manually measure. To satisfy the second condition, the same nucleotide binding/exchange experiment was carried out in the presence of an ATP regeneration system. Fig. 5, inset, shows that in the presence of the ATP regeneration system, the reaction mixture contained mostly ATP at the time chase was added. The three radioactive nucleotides that were bound prior to addition of the chase dissociated at a slow rate of 0.015 s−1 (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the three tight sites of rho retain their nucleotides at the active site as long as there is excess ATP in solution. Rho undergoes active ATP binding/hydrolysis events at the catalytic sites when ATP is present in solution. This active ATP binding and hydrolysis event at the catalytic sites appears to be necessary for retaining the ADP and Pi at the tight sites. These results suggest cooperativity among the two types of nucleotide binding sites of rho. Rho protein is known to contain two classes of nucleotide binding sites. About 3–4 ATPs bind to rho protein tightly and 2–3 bind weakly at equilibrium (20Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the significance and the role of these two classes of ATP binding sites. It has been assumed that the tight sites are the catalytic sites. The results reported in this paper clarify the role of the tight ATP binding sites on the rho hexamer. The findings from this study indicate that the tight nucleotide binding sites on the rho hexamer are noncatalytic. These sites are capable of hydrolyzing ATP, but the ATPase turnover at the noncatalytic sites is slow. The hydrolysis products (ADP and Pi) remain bound tightly at these sites and dissociate at a slow rate, relative to the ATPase turnover rate at the catalytic sites. Thus, the three tight ATP binding sites on rho do not participate in the fast ATPase turnover. The possibility of rho protein containing noncatalytic sites was considered previously by Stitt (19Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but no evidence for such sites was obtained. In these previously reported experiments, rho protein was mixed with radioactive ATP, and the rho-ATP complex was chased with nonradioactive ATP and RNA. Three radioactive ATPs were bound to rho before chase was added, and all of them were hydrolyzed upon addition of RNA. Based on these results, it was concluded that the three nucleotides were bound at the catalytic sites. Our results are consistent with the results of Stitt (19Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also observed hydrolysis of ATP at these tight sites. However, when we measured the dissociation rate of the tightly bound nucleotides, we observed a slow dissociation of the ADP and Pi species bound to these sites. Therefore, the three tight sites on rho cannot participate in the fast ATPase turnover and thus cannot be the catalytic sites. The exchange of nucleotides at the noncatalytic sites is slow only in the presence of RNA and when excess ATP is present in solution. In the absence of RNA or when ATP solution was hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi, the nucleotide exchange rate was faster. As long as the catalytic sites are actively binding/hydrolyzing ATP, the noncatalytic sites show stable binding of ADP and Pi. This suggests cooperation between the noncatalytic and the catalytic sites of rho. The rate of ATPase turnover at the noncatalytic sites also depends on the identity and the concentration of the RNA cofactor. The nucleotide dissociation rate constant was smallest from the rho-poly(C) complex, intermediate from the rho-poly(U) RNA complex, and fastest from rho uncomplexed with the RNA. The exact reason for this behavior is not known. If the nucleotides are bound at the interface of the rho subunits, as found in the F1-ATPase protein, then one might be able to provide a rationale for the above behavior, in terms of rho hexamer stability. A slower rate of nucleotide dissociation may occur from a more stable rho hexamer. It is known that poly(C) RNA binding to rho results in a stable rho hexamer (12Finger L.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In a stable hexamer, breathing or disruption of the subunit interfaces may be slow or occur less frequently, and thus nucleotide dissociation will be slower. This is consistent with the observation that nucleotides dissociate more slowly from poly(C) RNA-bound hexamer. If the three tight sites on rho are noncatalytic, then the weak sites that are not detectable by filter binding or ultrafiltration methods must be the catalytic sites. By performing ATP binding experiments at higher concentrations of ATP, Geiselmann et al.(20Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were able to detect 2–3 additional ATP binding sites. Similarly, we have observed 5–6 ADP·AlF4− species bound to rho in the presence of RNA (data not shown). Geiselmann et al.noted that the equilibrium dissociation constant of the three weak ATP binding sites (K d ∼ 10 μm) was the same as the enzymatic K m of the ATPase activity (about 10 μm). Furthermore, the three tight sites had a 10-fold tighter K d value relative to theK m value (20Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These findings support the hypothesis that the weak ATP binding sites, those sites that hydrolyze and turn over ATP at a rapid rate, are the catalytic sites. A recent report has shown that binding and hydrolysis of ATP at the catalytic sites is sequential, and only one ATP is hydrolyzed at a fast rate (24Stitt B.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26477-26486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This implies that at any given time there is only one catalytic site that has a tightly bound nucleotide, and ATP binding at the other two catalytic sites is weak, because ATP exchange at those sites is rapid. Noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites appear to be general to the hexameric helicases, because such sites are now found in at least two hexameric helicases, rho and bacteriophage T7 DNA helicase. Experiments similar to the ones reported in this paper were used to show that the three tight nucleotide binding sites of T7 DNA helicase hexamer are noncatalytic (23Hingorani M.M. Washington M.T. Moore K.C. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5012-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In T7 DNA helicase, these sites contained dTTP and some dTDP, and these nucleotides exchanged with a rate constant that was much slower than the dTTPase turnover rate. Such sites are well established in the hexameric F1-ATPase protein, which has a high degree of structural and amino acid sequence homology to rho. The noncatalytic sites of the F1-ATPase protein bind ATP, and these ATPs are not hydrolyzed under the conditions of the experiments (28Cross R.L. Nalin C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2874-2881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pagan J. Senior A.E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the rho protein, the ATPs at the noncatalytic sites are hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi, but the hydrolysis products remain tightly bound and their release into solution occurs very slowly. Thus, the noncatalytic sites on the hexameric helicases do show differences from such sites in the F1-ATPase protein. This is understandable because the structures of these proteins are different. Rho and T7 DNA helicases are homohexamers and F1-ATPase is an α3β3heterohexamer. The α subunits of F1-ATPase are designed to be noncatalytic. That is, the ATP binding site on the α subunit is lined with amino acids that facilitate tight ATP binding, but some critical amino acids that promote efficient hydrolysis of ATP are missing. In rho, the different rates of ATPase turnovers at the noncatalyticversusthe catalytic sites indicate different conformations of these subunits. These conformational changes do not have to be large to be significant. Even small changes in the position of the amino acids at the active sites can be enough to change the microenvironment of the ATP binding sites and to affect binding and hydrolysis of ATP. Because rho is a homohexamer, the asymmetry may be induced upon oligomerization or upon ATP binding/hydrolysis. Based on the similarity of rho with the F1-ATPase protein, we propose that rho hexamer may adopt a C3 or a pseudo-C6 symmetry. Such an intrinsic symmetry (C3 or C3/6) has been proposed by Horiguchi et al.(18Horiguchi T. Miwa Y. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 514-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) for the rho protein using chemical cross-linking experiments. In the F1-ATPase protein, the two classes of sites, catalytic and noncatalytic, are located on alternating subunits or interfaces between the subunits. This may be the case with the hexameric helicases as well. The exact role of the noncatalytic sites in the hexameric helicases or the F1-ATPase is not clear at present. In helicases, nucleotide binding at these sites may be necessary for the stabilization of the quaternary structure of the helicase, or these sites may play a regulatory function. Alternatively, these subunits may be involved in nucleic acid binding. There are many questions regarding the role of these sites that will need further investigation."

For example, three CPE-like proteins contain a Tyr in place of Glu300 (equivalent to Glu270 of carboxypeptidase A and B). To investigate the importance of this position, Glu300 of rat CPE was converted into Gln, Lys, or Tyr, and the proteins expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system. All three mutants were secreted from the cells, but the media showed no enzyme activity above background levels. Wild-type CPE and the Gln300 point mutant bound to a p-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose affinity resin, and this binding was competed by an active site-directed inhibitor, guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid. The affinity purified mutant CPE protein showed no detectable enzyme activity (<0.004% of wild-type CPE) toward dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg. Expression of the Gln300 and Lys300 mutant CPE proteins in the NIT3 mouse pancreatic beta-cell line showed that these mutants are routed into secretory vesicles and secreted via the regulated pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that Glu300 of CPE is essential for enzyme activity, but not required for substrate binding or for routing into the regulated secretory pathway.

Pancreatic carboxypeptidases A and B (CPA1 and CPB) are primarily involved with the digestion of food, whereas CPE and related family members perform more selective cleavages and are involved in the biosynthesis of peptides and proteins (1Fricker L.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Altogether, there are 13 members of this gene family, which is subdivided into two groups based on homology and size. Each group has 30–70% amino acid sequence identity with other members of the same group, but only 15–25% amino acid sequence identity with members of the other group. One group includes pancreatic CPA1, CPA2, CPB, mast cell CPA, and carboxypeptidase U (also known as plasma CPB) (2Bradshaw R.A. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Except for CPD, which is 180 kDa and contains 3 distinct carboxypeptidase-like domains, the members of this family contain a single carboxypeptidase domain of approximately 400 amino acids. Only CPE, CPM, CPN, CPZ, and the first two domains of CPD have been demonstrated to have enzymatic activity; the third domain of CPD and the other proteins in this group do not appear to cleave the standard carboxypeptidase substrates (13Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).The observation that CPX2, AEBP1, and the third domain of CPD are not active toward standard substrates is consistent with a comparison of active site residues of the various members of the family. CPX2, AEBP1, and the third domain of CPD lack a Glu in the position equivalent to Glu270 of CPA and CPB. Instead, these novel members of the gene family contain Tyr in this position (Fig.1). Glu270 in CPA/B is a critical catalytic residue that is thought to contribute a proton to the leaving group following hydrolysis of the amide bond (19Christianson D.W. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 281-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Theoretically, it is possible that a Tyr in this position could also function as a proton donor, but the catalytic activity would be predicted to be greatly reduced. However, substrate binding may not be greatly affected by the absence of a Glu in this position. These observations led to the prediction that the novel members of the metallocarboxypeptidase gene family that lack the Glu270equivalent residue are binding proteins, rather than active enzymes.In the present study, we tested the importance of Glu300 in rat CPE. In addition to testing the affect on enzyme activity and binding to a substrate affinity resin, we also tested whether the mutant CPE could be correctly sorted into the regulated secretory pathway in a CPE-deficient pancreatic beta cell line. Recently, CPE has been proposed to be involved in the sorting of neuroendocrine peptides into the regulated secretory pathway (20Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested in testing whether mutations that inactivate CPE had an influence on the sorting of CPE in a neuroendocrine cell line. For this analysis, we used the NIT3 cell line (21Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Furukawa H. Steiner D.F. Langley S.H. Leiter E.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4883-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which was derived fromCpe fat /Cpe fat mice and does not contain active CPE due to a point mutation of Ser202 to Pro in the coding region of the CPE gene (22Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). This cell line is an ideal test system to examine the sorting of CPE because it contains a regulated secretory pathway without endogenous CPE (the Pro202 mutant CPE is degraded before entry into the Golgi) (21Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Furukawa H. Steiner D.F. Langley S.H. Leiter E.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4883-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our findings that mutations of Glu300 eliminate CPE activity but not binding to a substrate affinity column supports the hypothesis that the novel family members lacking a Glu in the equivalent position are binding proteins rather than active enzymes. Furthermore, our finding that the CPE proteins with mutations of Glu300 are sorted into the regulated pathway in the NIT3 cells indicates that neither enzyme activity or substrate binding are required for this sorting.RESULTSWild type CPE has previously been expressed in high levels in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system (24Varlamov O. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13981-13986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mutation of the Glu300 into Lys, Gln, or Tyr does not affect the relative levels of CPE protein expression in the baculovirus system (Fig.2). High levels of CPE protein are detected in both cells and media for all three point mutants. However, enzymatic activity toward dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg is detectable only for the wild-type CPE (Table I). The level of enzyme activity of the wild-type CPE is similar to that determined in previous studies (13Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The three point mutants show only background activity that is comparable with controls with nonexpressing virus (Table I). Similar results were observed in three separate experiments. Because of the presence of low levels of endogenous activities in the Sf9 cells, studies on crude cells or media cannot rule out the possibility that the mutant proteins have low levels of enzyme activity. To investigate this further, purification of the proteins were attempted on a substrate affinity resin.Figure 2Western blot analysis of wild-type CPE (E-300) and various point mutants upon expression using the baculovirus system. Aliquots of cell (C) and media (M) after infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant baculovirus-expressing CPE were analyzed by Western blotting as described under “Materials and Methods.” Con, wild-type virus control.

Open table in a new tab When applied to a Sepharose column containingp-aminobenzoyl-Arg, the majority of the wild-type CPE is bound and only trace levels are detected in the flow through fraction (Fig. 3, F). Raising the pH to 8.0 causes most of the bound CPE to elute from the column (Fig. 3,E1). Similar analysis of the three point mutants showed that only the Gln300 form of CPE was able to bind to the affinity resin, and subsequently elute with high pH buffer (Fig. 3). Both the Lys300 and the Tyr300 mutants were unable to bind to the affinity resin. To test whether a small amount of protein bound to the column but could not be eluted by the high pH, the columns were also eluted with a high concentration of Arg after the high pH treatment. This treatment, which elutes other carboxypeptidases such as CPD, did not elute any detectable amount of Lys300or Tyr300 CPE (Fig. 3, E2). Thus, these two mutants do not appear able to bind to the substrate affinity resin, whereas the Gln300 mutant is able to bind.Figure 3Western blot analysis of the binding of wild-type CPE and various point mutants to a substrate affinity column. CPE expression media (S) from Sf9 cells were applied to p-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose 6B affinity columns as described under “Materials and Methods.” The flow through (F) represents the fraction of the media passing through the column unretained. The binding proteins were eluted first with pH 8.0 Tris-Cl buffer (E1), then with 25 mmarginine in the pH 8.0 buffer (E2). The entire experiment was repeated three times with comparable results. The molecular masses of prestained standards (Life Technologies, Inc.) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To ensure that the binding of the Gln300 form of CPE to thep-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Sepharose represents binding to the active site of the protein, we tested whether an active site-directed inhibitor could compete for this binding. GEMSA is a competitive inhibitor of CPE with K i around 10 nm(29Fricker L.D. Plummer T.H.J. Snyder S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 994-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When affinity column-bound wild-type or Gln300 CPE was incubated with 0.1 mm GEMSA, nearly all of the bound protein was eluted. To quantitate this, the experiment was performed with various concentrations of GEMSA. Approximately 50% of the wild-type CPE is eluted from the p-aminobenzoyl-Arg column with 6 μm GEMSA (Fig. 4). Similar analysis of the Gln300 form of CPE shows that 2 μm GEMSA elutes 50% of the bound protein (Fig. 4). Thus, both wild-type and Gln300 CPE bind to the affinity column through their active sites, and this binding is competed by generally similar concentrations of an active site-directed inhibitor.Figure 4Competition of the binding of CPE to the substrate affinity resin with GEMSA. Wild-type CPE (E300) and a mutant (Q300) were loaded onto the affinity column, and the protein was eluted with various concentrations of GEMSA at pH 5.5 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The columns were subsequently eluted with pH 8.0 buffer, and the amount of CPE in each elute was quantitated by analysis on a polyacrylamide gel followed by silver staining and densitization of the protein bands. The level of CPE in the first eluate is shown as a percentage of the total amount of CPE bound to each column. The experiment was performed twice, and the average of the two experiments is shown. Error bars show the range of these two determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Following purification of the Gln300 form of CPE on the affinity columns, the activity toward the standard carboxypeptidase substrate dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg was tested. For this analysis, the affinity column-bound protein was eluted by raising the pH to 8.0 (as done in Fig. 3) rather than with GEMSA (as done in Fig. 4) because GEMSA would interfere with the enzyme activity measurement. Wild type CPE showed a V max of 20 μmol/min/mg protein, whereas no activity could be detected for the Gln300 form of CPE. Based on the sensitivity of the assay and the amount of purified protein tested, the Gln300 CPE has less than 0.004% of the activity of wild-type CPE.To test whether CPE activity or substrate binding are required for sorting of CPE into the regulated pathway, we expressed the proteins in the NIT3 pancreatic cell line. For this analysis, the HA epitope was added to the N terminus of the CPE so that the expressed protein could be detected above the background of endogenous CPE, which is only detected in the endoplasmic reticulum of these cells due to the naturally occurring point mutation (21Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Furukawa H. Steiner D.F. Langley S.H. Leiter E.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4883-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing rat prodynorphin so that the distribution of the CPE could be compared with that of a prohormone. Prodynorphin has been previously found to be routed into the secretory pathway of neuroendocrine cells (30Devi L. Gupta P. J.

When expressed in NIT3 cells, the epitope tagged wild-type CPE (Glu300 showed a punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm) (Fig. 5). Co-staining of the cells with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to prodynorphin showed a similar pattern of distribution (Fig. 5). This pattern is consistent with localization of the CPE to secretory vesicles in this cell type. The distribution of the Lys300and Gln300 forms of CPE also showed overlap to the prodynorphin (Fig. 5), suggesting that they were also routed to the secretory vesicles.Figure 5Immunocytochemistry of NIT3 cells expressing epitope-tagged wild-type CPE (E 300 ) or various point mutations. Cells were transiently co-transfected with cDNA encoding HA-tagged CPE and prodynorphin and then stained with antibodies to HA epitope-tag (left column) and the 13 S antiserum to dynorphin B-13 (right column) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Scale bar: 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To directly examine if the expressed CPE was routed to the regulated secretory pathway, the media of the cells were examined following stimulation with 45 mm KCl. In the absence of stimulation, extremely low levels of CPE protein are detected in the media (Fig.6). Following stimulation with KCl, there is a substantial increase in the amount of CPE detected in the media (Fig. 6). Quantitation of the results from three experiments shows the secretion of the Gln300 and Lys300forms of CPE to be stimulated by KCl to a similar degree as the epitope-tagged wild-type Glu300 form of CPE. Thus, enzyme activity or substrate binding do not appear to be required for entry of CPE into the regulated secretory pathway.Figure 6Regulated secretion of wild-type CPE (E 300 ) and point mutants from NIT3 cells.Cells stably transfected with different HA-tagged CPE constructs were incubated for 40 min either in control media or with 45 mmKCl, and then the media were analyzed on a Western blot using antibodies to the HA epitope. Similar results were obtained with three separate clones for each construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONA major finding of this study is that Glu300 of CPE is essential for enzyme activity but not for substrate binding. The critical nature of this residue was predicted from previous studies on the structure and function of CPA and CPB, but due to the relatively low conservation of amino acids between CPE and the CPA/B subfamily, it was important to test this directly. In CPA and CPB, the Glu in a comparable position (Glu270 is thought to be responsible for the protonation of the leaving group following hydrolysis of the amide bond (19Christianson D.W. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 281-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other hydrolases, such as β-lactamases, some members of the gene family contain a Glu in a position thought to function as a general base, whereas other family members contain a Tyr in a comparable position (32Philippon A. Dusart J. Joris B. Frere J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, Tyr is potentially able to function in this capacity in the novel members of the CPE gene family.In this study, replacement of the Glu300 of CPE with Tyr resulted in an inactive enzyme that did not bind to the substrate affinity column. It is possible that the bulky side chain of the Tyr caused changes in the active site that precluded substrate binding. The substitution of Gln for Glu is relatively minor, changing only the -COOH into a -CONH2. This smaller change preserved binding to the substrate affinity column, indicating that binding does not require Glu300. Even though the Tyr300 and Lys300 forms of CPE were not able to bind to the affinity resin, these forms were secreted from both the Sf9 cells, and the Lys300 CPE was secreted from NIT3 cells (Tyr300 CPE was not examined in NIT3 cells). In contrast, forms of CPE containing deletions of 33 or more C-terminal residues, or point mutation of Ser202 into Pro are not secreted from either cell type and are degraded before protein transport into the Golgi (24Varlamov O. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13981-13986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6077-6083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The failure of these other mutations of CPE to be secreted presumably reflects the improper folding of these proteins. Because the Tyr300 and Lys300 forms of CPE were secreted in levels comparable with wild-type CPE, these point mutants are unlikely to be completely misfolded.The regulated secretion of Gln300 and Lys300CPE in the NIT3 cells indicates that neither enzyme activity or substrate binding are required for entry into the regulated pathway. Recently, Y. P. Loh and colleagues (20Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 34Normant E. Loh Y.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have proposed that CPE is a hormone-sorting receptor. This proposal is based on studies examining the sorting of prohormones in the fat/fat mouse, and in cell lines that have a reduced level of CPE protein due to the expression of antisense RNA. However, proinsulin sorting is not dependent on CPE, based on studies of primary cultures of pancreatic beta cells (35Irminger J.-C. Verchere C.B. Meyer K. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27532-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or the NIT3 beta cell line (21Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Furukawa H. Steiner D.F. Langley S.H. Leiter E.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4883-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The sorting of proinsulin and insulin into the regulated pathway of the beta cells proceeds in the complete absence of CPE from this pathway. Also, previous studies have found that prodynorphin is routed to the regulated secretory pathway in the NIT3 cell line. 2L. Devi, personal communication. Thus, CPE is not essential for the sorting of prohormones in pancreatic beta cells, although it is possible that CPE contributes to this process in other cell types. The mechanism by which CPE is sorted into the regulated pathway has not been elucidated. The C-terminal region of CPE appears to contain an element that contributes to the sorting into the regulated pathway; attachment of the C-terminal 50 residues to albumin causes a portion of the fusion protein to be secreted via the regulated pathway (33Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6077-6083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This region is distinct from the membrane-binding motif also present in the C-terminal region of CPE (36Mitra A. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19876-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPE aggregates at slightly acidic pH values, and this aggregation is enhanced by Ca2+ (37Nalamachu S.R. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11192-11195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7963-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); it is possible that this aggregation contributes to the routing of CPE. Models of co-aggregation of the secretory vesicle constituents have been proposed to account for the routing of the proteins into the regulated pathway (39Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 40Bauerfeind R. Huttner W.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because the mutants of CPE that do not bind to the substrate affinity column are correctly routed in the NIT3 cells, the mechanism of CPE sorting presumably does not involve substrate binding to the active site.The finding that Glu300 is not essential for binding of CPE to the affinity column supports the hypothesis that the new members of the CPE gene family that lack a Glu in the comparable position function as binding proteins rather than active enzymes. These three proteins (CPX2, AEBP1, and the third CP-like domain of CPD) have not been found to have enzyme activity upon expression in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system (13Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8382-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although AEBP1 was reported to have detectable activity upon expression in bacteria (16He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), this activity was extremely low (0.02 absorption units at 256 nm with the substrate hippuryl-Arg after 10 min with 2 μg of enzyme). Furthermore, attempts to repeat the experiment using the identical constructs, expression system, and assay were unsuccessful. 3Y. Qian, O. Varlamov, and L. D. Fricker, unpublished results. However, it remains possible that these proteins are active enzymes. The substitution of the Tyr for Glu300 of CPE was created with the hope that the protein would still bind to the affinity column and thus be able to be purified and tested with substrate in the absence of other enzymes present in the Sf9 cells and media. This was done for the Gln300 mutant, with the finding that this variant had less than 0.004% of the activity of wild-type CPE. However, as discussed above, the bulky side chain of the Tyr may have altered the active site and prevented binding to the affinity resin. Although alternative purification strategies could have been used to isolate the enzyme, the failure to bind to the substrate affinity resin suggests that the protein would not bind substrates and would therefore be unlikely to possess enzyme activity. The lack of enzyme activity in the media or cell extracts of the Sf9 cells infected with Tyr300 CPE-expressing baculovirus indicates that this mutant has less than 0.6% of the wild-type CPE activity.In summary, Glu300 of CPE is essential for enzyme activity but not substrate binding. The recent identification of three members of the CPE gene family that lack a Glu in a comparable position highlights the importance of this residue. Interestingly, several other enzyme families contain members with substitutions of critical active site residues that affect enzyme activity but not substrate binding. For example, aspartyl protease-like proteins that lack the critical Asp have been found in bovine and sheep placenta (41Roberts R.M. Xie S. Nagel R.J. Low B. Green J. Beckers J.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 362: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 42Xie S. Green J. Bixby J.B. Szafranska B. DeMartini J.C. Hecht S. Roberts R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12809-12816Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and disintegrin-like proteins that lack the consensus site for metal binding have been found in human brain, testis, and other tissues (43Sagane K. Ohya Y. Hasegawa Y. Tanaka I. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,44van Huijsduijnen R.H. Gene. 1998; 206: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to these inactive members of protease gene families, several phosphatase-like proteins that lack one or more residues critical for catalytic activity have been discovered (45Zhang Z.Y. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Taken together with the present study, these results suggest th"

The enzyme exhibits remarkable specificity, and so far no molecules other than l-glutamate andl-threo-3-methylaspartate have been found to be substrates. Here we describe the reaction of glutamate mutase with the substrate analog, 2-ketoglutarate. Binding of 2-ketoglutarate (or its hydrate) to the holoenzyme elicits a change in the UV-visible spectrum consistent with the formation of cob(II)alamin on the enzyme. 2-ketoglutarate undergoes rapid exchange of tritium between the 5′-position of the coenzyme and C-4 of 2-ketoglutarate, consistent with the formation of a 2-ketoglutaryl radical analogous to that formed with glutamate. Under aerobic conditions this leads to the slow inactivation of the enzyme, presumably through reaction of free radical species with oxygen. Despite the formation of a substrate-like radical, no rearrangement of 2-ketoglutarate to 3-methyloxalacetate could be detected. The results indicate that formation of the C-4 radical of 2-ketoglutarate is a facile process but that it does not undergo further reactions, suggesting that this may be a useful substrate analog with which to investigate the mechanism of coenzyme homolysis.

It is one of a group of enzymes that use adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl),1 a biologically active form of vitamin B12, to catalyze unusual 1,2-rearrangements in which an electron-withdrawing group is interchanged with a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (4Banerjee R. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 175-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Buckel W. Golding B.T. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1996; 25: 329-337Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Marsh E.N.G. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) The migrating group may be -OH, -NH2, or, as in the case of glutamate mutase, a carbon-containing fragment so that a skeletal rearrangement is effected (Fig. 1). The role of AdoCbl as the source of carbon-based radicals, which are unmasked by homolysis of the coenzyme cobalt-carbon bond, is well established (7Halpern J. Science. 1985; 227: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Experiments with isotopically labeled substrates and coenzyme have demonstrated that for all the enzymes examined including glutamate mutase, 5′-deoxyadenosine acts as the intermediate carrier of the migrating hydrogen (8Switzer R.L. Baltimore B.G. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5263-5268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7542-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that in glutamate mutase homolysis of the cobalt-carbon bond and hydrogen abstraction from the substrate are kinetically coupled processes (10Marsh E.N.G. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11864-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Adenosyl radical can therefore only be formed as a transient high energy species, or may not be formed at all if coenzyme homolysis and hydrogen abstraction are truly concerted processes. Similar findings have been reported for the related AdoCbl-dependent enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (11Padmakumar R. Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3713-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These unexpected observations have focused our attention on the role of the substrate in initiating free radical formation. A further intriguing and poorly understood aspect of these reactions is how the enzyme controls the rearrangement of substrate-radical to product-radical. In principle, these steps might be probed with substrates that give rise to radicals of differing stabilities or that only participate in part of the catalytic cycle. However, attempts to find alternative substrates for glutamate mutase have been unsuccessful because the enzyme, in common with most other AdoCbl-dependent isomerases, appears to show very high substrate specificity. Several glutamate analogs have been reported to act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme, among them (2S,3S)- and (2S,3R)-3-methylglutamate (12Hartzoulakis B. Gani D. Proc. Indian Acad. Chem. Sci. 1994; 106: 1165-1176Google Scholar), (2R,3RS)-3-fluoroglutamate, (2S,4S)-4-fluoroglutamate (13Leutbecher U. Bocher R. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and 2methyleneglutarate (13Leutbecher U. Bocher R. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) which, interestingly, is a substrate for the related AdoCbl-dependent enzyme, 2-methyleneglutarate mutase (14Beatrix B. Zelder O. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 266: 577-582Google Scholar). We report experiments with the glutamate analog 2-ketoglutarate (2-KG). We show that 2-KG functions in a partial reaction with the enzyme that results in the rapid transfer of tritium between the 5′-carbon of AdoCbl and C-4 of 2-KG. However, the resulting 2-ketoglutaryl radical appears unable to proceed onwards to the expected branch-chain product; instead, under aerobic conditions, a relatively slow side reaction occurs that results in inactivation of the enzyme. The purification of glutamate mutase apoenzyme, GlmES, has been described previously (15Chen H.-P. Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14393-14945Google Scholar). 3-Methylaspartase was purified as described by Hsiang and Bright (16Hsiang M.W. Bright H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3079-3088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5′-[3H]AdoCbl was synthesized by using glutamate mutase to catalyze the exchange of tritium from tritiated glutamate to AdoCbl (9Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7542-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). AdoCbl and 2-KG were purchased from Sigma; tritiated glutamic acid was purchased from Amersham PLC. The sources of other materials have been described previously (9Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7542-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Chen H.-P. Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14393-14945Google Scholar) or were purchased from commercial suppliers. Reactions were set up in small vials containing 10 μm GlmES, 10 μm AdoCbl, and 10 mm 2-KG in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 25 °C in the dark. At various times, portions of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and divided in two; one portion was assayed for enzyme activity in the presence of fresh coenzyme; the other portion was used to determine the amount of AdoCbl remaining in the reaction by HPLC. For anaerobic work the vials were fitted with septa and made anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with argon; transfer of reagents between vials was made by syringe. A solution containing 50 μm glutamate mutase and 50 μmAdoCbl in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was made anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with argon. The solution was introduced by syringe into a cuvette fitted with a septum. The spectrum of the resting enzyme was recorded using a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrometer. A concentrated anaerobic solution of either 2-KG or l-glutamate was then added (final concentration 5 mm), and after 20 s, the spectrum of the enzyme-substrate complex recorded. Reactions were set up at 25 °C under argon in light proofed 2.5-ml glass vials fitted with septa. Reaction mixtures (final volume, 0.5 ml) contained 10 μm GlmES protein, 10 μm5′-[3H]AdoCbl (100,000 dpm/nmol) in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The reaction was initiated by addition of 50 μl of 100 mm 2-KG to give a final concentration of 10 mm. At various times, 50-μl portions of the mixture were withdrawn, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 5% trifluoroacetic acid solution. The reaction products were separated by HPLC on a C4 reverse phase column as described previously (9Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7542-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the tritium content of the recovered 2-KG and AdoCbl was determined by scintillation counting. A sample containing 10 μm glutamate mutase, 10 μm5′-[3H]AdoCbl (10,000 dpm total activity) and 10 mm 2-KG in 200 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was allowed to react for 45 min at room temperature, after which time exchange of tritium into 2-KG was essentially complete. AdoCbl was removed from the mixture by adsorption onto activated charcoal, and the sample was divided into two portions: one-half was brought to pH 10.2 by addition of sodium bicarbonate buffer, and as a control, the other half was maintained at pH 7.0. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 24 h and then the water was removed by bulb-to-bulb distillation under vacuum. The tritium contents of the distilled water and the nonvolatile fractions were determined by scintillation counting. A 0.5 ml solution containing 50 μm enzyme, 50 μm AdoCbl, 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in D2O was made anaerobic and introduced into an NMR tube. An anaerobic solution of 2-KG in D2O was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the sample was incubated at room temperature in the dark. At various times over the following 24 h, NMR spectra of the sample were acquired. Spectra were recorded at 400 MHz. Glutamate mutase activity was measured spectroscopically by coupling the formation of 3-methylaspartate to mesaconate through the action of methylaspartase, as described by Barker et al. (1Barker H.A. Roove V. Suzuki F. Iodice A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3260-3266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the buffer was 100 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.0. The data were plotted and curves fitted using the KaleidaGraphTM program (Abelbeck Software). Our experiments used an engineered form of glutamate mutase, GlmES, in which the weakly associating E and S subunits of the wild-type enzyme have been genetically fused into one protein chain by introduction of an eleven amino acid linker sequence (15Chen H.-P. Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14393-14945Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the reaction with an efficiency similar to that of wild-type enzyme, but it binds coenzyme stoichiometrically and in a manner that is independent of protein concentration. These properties of the GlmES protein greatly simplify interpretation of mechanistic experiments (10Marsh E.N.G. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11864-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,15Chen H.-P. Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14393-14945Google Scholar). Our initial experiments focused on whether 2-KG or the hydrated form that predominates in solution acted as either a competitive inhibitor or an irreversible inhibitor of glutamate mutase. 2-KG did not appear to bind very tightly to the enzyme, as no inhibition of activity was observed at concentrations up to 1 mm; for comparison, theK m for l-glutamate is 0.5 mm. It was not possible to extend measurements to higher concentrations of 2-KG as the compound absorbs at 240 nm, the wavelength used to assay for glutamate mutase activity. Despite the apparently weak binding of 2-KG, upon incubation with glutamate mutase and AdoCbl over the course of several hours the compound was found to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme (Fig.2). The initial loss of activity was well described by pseudo-first order kinetics withk inact = 0.058 ± 0.008 min−1and was accompanied by degradation of the coenzyme, which occurred with essentially identical kinetics, k = 0.061 ± 0.008 min−1, suggesting that the two processes were mechanistically linked. Control experiments established that neither AdoCbl nor 2-KG alone caused significant loss of enzyme activity, indicating that inactivation results from reaction of the coenzyme and substrate on the protein. However, very little loss of activity was observed when the experiments were repeated under rigorously anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2). Taken together, these observations suggested that, upon binding to the holoenzyme, 2-KG was able to initiate homolysis of AdoCbl and that inactivation resulted from the subsequent reaction of oxygen with free radical species. It was apparent that neither all the coenzyme was degraded nor all the activity lost. This phenomenon may be attributed to the dilution of both active enzyme and AdoCbl that occurs during the reaction, which, in turn, results in dissociation of the enzyme·AdoCbl complex so that at low concentrations the reaction is no longer pseudo-first order. When glutamate mutase holoenzyme is mixed with eitherl-glutamate orl-threo-3-methylaspartate, changes in the UV-visible spectrum of AdoCbl are observed that are associated with the formation of Co(II) species on the enzyme (10Marsh E.N.G. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11864-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Chen H.-P. Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7884-7889Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether 2-KG initiated similar spectral changes indicative of Cbl(II) formation, as would be expected if radical species accumulated on the enzyme. Addition of 2-KG (final concentration 5 mm) resulted in a decrease in absorbance at 520 nm and an increase in absorbance at 470 nm (Fig. 3), consistent with the formation of Cbl(II) species on the enzyme. Increasing the concentration of 2-KG to 25 mm did not result in any further significant changes in the spectrum. Assuming Δε530 of 4,000m−1 cm−1, (10Marsh E.N.G. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11864-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) the proportion of enzyme in the Cbl(II) form is 35%, whereas in the presence of 5 mml-glutamate, 45% of the enzyme is in the Cbl(II) form. To seek further evidence that 2-KG was directly participating in the reaction mechanism of glutamate mutase, we investigated whether the enzyme could catalyze the transfer of tritium from the 5′ position of AdoCbl to 2-KG. When the enzyme and 5′-[3H]AdoCbl (10 μm each) were incubated with 10 mm 2-KG, tritium was rapidly lost from AdoCbl and correspondingly appeared in 2-KG (Fig. 4). The time course of these two processes mirror each other, consistent with tritium being transferred directly from AdoCbl to 2-KG. The time course of the transfer reaction appeared to be biphasic; a rapid initial phase was observed that was complete within 20 s, followed by a slower phase that occurred over several minutes. Similar biphasic kinetic behavior was observed previously for the transfer of tritium between AdoCbl and the natural substrate, 3-methylaspartate (9Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7542-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In that case it was shown that the fast phase of the reaction was due to the transfer of tritium from enzyme-bound AdoCbl to methylaspartate, whereas the slower phase represented exchange of bound coenzyme with unbound coenzyme. A similar phenomenon would explain the kinetic behavior observed in this case. The dissociation constant for AdoCbl is 2 μm; therefore only about 75% of the coenzyme is expected to be bound to the enzyme under the conditions of the experiment. This is in accord with the relative amplitudes observed for the two kinetic phases. The apparent rate constant for tritium transfer from AdoCbl to 2-KG was 0.3 s−1. This compares favorably with the value of 0.5 ± 0.05 s−1 measured previously for tritium transfer from AdoCbl to methylaspartate (9Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7542-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To establish whether tritium was transferred to C-3 or C-4 of 2-KG, we exploited the fact that the C-3 protons readily exchange with solvent under alkaline conditions, and therefore any tritium at this position should be lost to water. The enzyme, 5′-tritiated AdoCbl, and a large excess of 2-KG were incubated together, and after tritium exchange was complete, AdoCbl was removed by adsorption on charcoal. The pH of the sample was then raised to 10.2, and the C-3 protons were allowed to exchange with solvent. However, after distillation no tritium was found in the water, and all the radioactivity was accounted for in the nonvolatile fraction. We conclude, therefore, that the tritium is exclusively introduced at C-4 of 2-KG, in accord with mechanistic expectations based on the reaction of the enzyme with glutamate. This observation also excludes the transient formation of 3-methyloxalacetate at the active site (followed by reversal to 2-KG), as this would result in scrambling of the tritium between C-3 and C-4 of 2-KG. The experiments described above all pointed to the C-4 radical of 2-KG being formed at the enzyme active site. It therefore seemed plausible that 2-KG might be converted into 3-methyloxalacetate in a rearrangement analogous to that undergone by the natural substrate. NMR spectroscopy was used to examine whether 2-KG was being converted into 3-methyloxalacetate or other compounds by the enzyme. No significant changes in the NMR spectrum of the sample were apparent after 24 h. In particular, the rearranged product should contain a methyl group that would give rise to a characteristic doublet in the high field region of the spectrum, but no resonances were evident in this region. We conservatively estimate that we could detect about 2% conversion of substrate to product under the experimental conditions employed. This would correspond to only four turnovers of the enzyme in 24 h; for comparison, k cat for GlmES is 5 s−1at 25 °C (15Chen H.-P. Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14393-14945Google Scholar). This result indicates that very little if any of the 2-ketoglutaryl radical generated on the enzyme undergoes rearrangement. The AdoCbl-dependent isomerases in general show very high substrate specificity. This has hampered efforts to gain insight into the mechanism of these enigmatic rearrangements by using substrate analogs that might potentially function as mechanism-based inhibitors of these enzymes. Particularly intriguing is the ability of these enzymes to stabilize free radical species, formed through homolysis of AdoCbl, by an estimated 25–30 kcal/mol relative to their formation in free solution (18Hay B.P. Finke R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 4820-4829Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 19Finke R.G. Bleasdale C. Golding B.T. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioorganic Processes. Royal Society of Chemistry, Newcastle, UK1990: 244-280Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrate that 2-KG participates in a partial catalytic cycle on the enzyme that results in the formation of the C-4 radical of either 2-KG or its hydrate, however, this radical does not appear to undergo rearrangement to give products. 2-KG is the first molecule, other than the true substrates, for which the reversible transfer of hydrogen between coenzyme and substrate, a crucial step in the mechanism of the enzyme, has been demonstrated. The tritium exchange reaction is rapid, approaching the rate observed previously with methylaspartate (9Marsh E.N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7542-7547Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), indicating that it serves as a proficient substrate for the hydrogen transfer reaction. We have not established the stereochemistry of hydrogen abstraction at C-4 of 2-KG, but it is expected that the pro-S hydrogen is exchanged with AdoCbl by analogy with the stereochemical course of the reaction withl-glutamate. Although incubation with 2-KG under aerobic conditions does lead to inactivation of the enzyme, this appears to be a slow side reaction that is also observed with the natural substrates (13Leutbecher U. Bocher R. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Oxygen, presumably, reacts with radical species at the enzyme active site, leading to oxidation of the coenzyme and/or the protein that results in inactivation. It remains unclear whether it is the keto or hydrated form of 2-KG (or both) that is bound by the enzyme. Under the conditions of the reaction the hydrated form predominates, but there is no strong evidence to favor one species over the other, as either can be considered a reasonable mimic of glutamate and could in principle undergo hydrogen abstraction. However, hydration would make a difference in the ability of the substrate radical to undergo rearrangement. In the keto form, the substrate radical could, in principle, rearrange through the intermediacy of a cyclopropyl radical in which the unpaired electron is delocalized onto the oxygen: a precedent for such a rearrangement comes from the isomerization of succinyl-CoA analog, succinyl-carba-(dethia)-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (20Michenfelder M. Retey J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1986; 25: 366-367Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the hydrated form, the migrating carbon would be sp 3hybridized and therefore unable to rearrangement through a cyclopropyl intermediate. Instead a fragmentation-recombination mechanism, analogous to that proposed for the rearrangement of glutamate to methylaspartate (5Buckel W. Golding B.T. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1996; 25: 329-337Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) would have to apply. This would involve the formation of an oxalyl radical intermediate, as opposed to a glycyl radical (as shown in Fig. 1), which may be less energetically favorable. The UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 3) indicates that about 35% of the holoenzyme exists in the Cbl(II) form when 2-KG is bound, this is similar to the amount of coenzyme cleavage observed with glutamate bound (45%). The identity of the free radical partner to Cbl(II) formed in the reaction of 2-KG with glutamate mutase is of interest. Buckel and co-workers (21Bothe H. Darley D.J. Albracht S.P.J. Gerfen G.J. Golding B.T. Buckel W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4105-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently identified the C-4 radical of glutamate as the organic radical that accumulates on the enzyme during catalysis. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that, for both glutamate and methylaspartate, coenzyme homolysis and hydrogen abstraction are kinetically coupled (10Marsh E.N.G. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11864-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It seems most likely, therefore, that the products of homolysis in the present case are Cbl(II), 5′-deoxyadenosine and 2-ketoglutaryl radical (or its hydrate), as opposed to 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical and 2-KG. The mechanism by which AdoCbl-dependent enzymes effect homolysis of the coenzyme, a reaction that is highly endothermic in free solution, to produce relatively stable radical species at the active site remains one of the most challenging aspects of B12 catalysis. Pre-steady state kinetic analysis of the cobalt-carbon bond breaking step is complicated by the fact that the substrate radicals produced go on to rearrange so that multiple equilibria become established on the enzyme (10Marsh E.N.G. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11864-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this regard, 2-KG may prove a very useful substrate for studying the coenzyme homolysis/hydrogen atom abstraction reaction because the 2-KG radical, once formed, does not react further. This should simplify the interpretation of kinetic experiments with isotopically labeled substrate and coenzyme that aim to gain insights into the transition state of this reaction."

Within a tightly controlled environment, spermatogonia undergo rapid successive divisions to form spermatocytes, which, upon passage through a meiotic phase, enter a differentiation or spermiogenic phase in which spermatids undergo morphological changes to form mature sperm. The processes resulting in the formation of spermatozoa are well defined at the morphological level. However, the molecular signals responsible for tissue- and stage-specific gene expression throughout germ cell development are less well defined. Several genes have been identified that are only expressed in the testis or express a testis-specific variant of a somatic gene (1Wilkinson K. Ashworth A. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Propst F. Rosenberg M.P. Vande Woude G.F.

Genet. 1995; 16: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) genes that confer male germ cell-specific transcription onto reporter genes have been delineated. These studies identified transcription factor binding sites crucial for their expression. Although the transcription factors that bind to such sites have not been positively identified for most cases, a small number have been characterized (reviewed in Refs. 10Hecht N.B. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar and 11Lindsey S. Wilkinson M.F. J. Assist. Reprod. Genet. 1996; 13: 182-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The best characterized testis-specific transcription factor is perhaps CREMτ. Full-length CREMτ acts as a positive regulator of transcription in spermatids (12Foulkes N.S. Mellstrom B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 13Delmas V. Laoide B.M. Masquilier D. de Groot R.P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4226-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Under the control of follicle-stimulating hormone, a switch in the regulation of expression of CREM occurs during spermatogenesis. Negative regulators CREMα, CREMβ, and CREMγ are shut off, and the positive regulator CREMτ is switched on (12Foulkes N.S. Mellstrom B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 14Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Pevet P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 362: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). An unstable form of CREMτ RNA is first expressed in spermatocytes. In spermatids, CREMτ RNA stability is greatly increased due to the use of an alternative polyadenylation site, and the CREMτ protein is only produced in these cells (15Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1992; 68: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation sites on CREMτ regulate its activity (16de Groot R.P. den Hertog J. Vandenheede J.R. Goris J. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3903-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Finally, the appearance of CREM activator protein in spermatids correlates with the transcription activation ofOdf1, which contains a CREMτ binding site (17Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Strong positive regulation of Odf1 by CREMτ was further shown byin vitro transcription assays and transfection assays, implicating an important regulatory role for CREMτ in Odf1transcription during spermatogenesis (17Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The generation of CREMτ knockout mice (18Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.

Nieschlag E. Schuetz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) further showed that in addition toOdf1, mP1, testis angiotensin-converting enzyme, and TP1 are also regulated by CREMτ in spermatids. In addition to CREMτ, several genes have been cloned from testis cDNA libraries that contain motifs found in transcriptional regulatory proteins. Two zinc finger-containing genes have been identified: Zfp-35, which is pachytene spermatocyte-specific (20Cunliffe V. Williams S. Trowsdale J. Genomics. 1990; 8: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and Zfp-29, which is expressed in round spermatids (21Denny P. Ashworth A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 106: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Testis-specific genes encoding high mobility group box motifs have also been cloned. Boissonneault and Lau (22Boissonneault G. Lau Y.-F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4323-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) isolated the testis-specific high mobility group that is predominantly located in elongating spermatids and may be involved in the regulation of gene expression of the haploid male genome. An SRY-related gene that also encodes a high mobility group box designated Sox-5 was isolated (23Denny P. Swift S. Conner F. Ashworth A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3705-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Sox-5 is most highly expressed in round spermatids (reviewed in Ref. 24Graves J.A. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The function of these putative transcription factors in spermatogenesis and the promoters that they interact with remain to be determined. Putative transcription factors were also identified based on specific protein-DNA interactions. Factors present in testis extracts have been shown to interact specifically withcis-acting elements in the promoters for several genes including mP1 (25Tamura T. Makino Y. Mikoshiba K. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4327-4332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), testis-specific histone H1t (26Grimes S.R. Wolfe S.A. Koppel D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and PGK-2 (27Gebara M.M. McCarrey J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1422-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,28Goto M. Masamune Y. Nakanishi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The appearance of a 13-kDa protein and a 30-kDa protein, which bind the H1t promoter, coincides with the onset of transcription of the H1t gene (Ref. 29Grimes S.R. Wolfe S.A. Koppel D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 30Grimes S.R. van Wert J. Wolfe S.A. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 24: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Testis-specific and promoter-specific regulation of PGK-2 transcription involves the binding of TAP-I, resulting in stimulation of PGK-2 transcription (28Goto M. Masamune Y. Nakanishi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that an uncharacterized testis-specific transcription factor, which we called TTF-D, binds to theOdf1 promoter (31van der Hoorn F.A. Tarnasky H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A related binding site was identified in the c-mos promoter (32van der Hoorn F.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1093-1099PubMed Google Scholar). Using testis-specific nuclear extracts, we analyzed TTF-D and its pattern of expression in the developing testis, and we investigated the role of TTF-D inOdf1 promoter activity. Nuclei from rat liver and seminiferous tubules (STs) were prepared as described by van der Hoorn and Tarnasky (31van der Hoorn F.A. Tarnasky H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations in the dialyzed nuclear extracts ranged from 9 to 16 mg/ml. Nuclear extracts from mouse testes were prepared as described by Lilienbaum and Paulin (33Lilienbaum A. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2180-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). Gel retardation assays were performed as described previously (34van der Hoorn F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using double-stranded (ds) oligonucleotides Odf1D1 (5′-AATTGGCCTTAGGG-3′) and c-mosD1 (5′-ATGGACTTAGGA-3′) labeled with Klenow polymerase. In the indicated experiments, ss oligonucleotides were labeled with polynucleotide kinase. Reaction mixtures contained 1 ng of labeled oligonucleotide DNA, 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC)(dI-dC), and extract. The reaction products were separated on 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. In the indicated experiments, an excess of unlabeled ds or ss oligonucleotide DNA was used as competitor DNA. Oligonucleotides used in such competition experiments were D2 (5′-AATTACCTTAACTG-3′), B (5′-AATTGTGGCTCCTGCCC-3′), MUT1 (5′-AATTCTCCTTAGGG-3′), MUT2 (5′-AATTGGCACGAGGG-3′), and MUT3 (5′-AATTGGCCTTCTAG-3′). To determine the molecular weight of proteins capable of forming complexes in the gel retardation assays, the radiolabeled oligonucleotide DNA-protein complexes were cross-linked by UV irradiation using a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) before separation on native polyacrylamide gels or on 8% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Liver and ST nuclear proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to NitroPlus nitrocellulose filters (Micron Separations Inc., Fisher Scientific, Nepean, Ontario, Canada), and incubated in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% skim milk powder) (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD) for 1 h at 4 °C. Filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C in binding buffer (25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml ss herring sperm DNA). The filters were then probed using 105 cpm/ml Odf1D1 DNA in binding buffer for 6 h at 4 °C. After four 8-min washes in binding buffer at 4 °C, filters were exposed to Kodak XAR film. In vitro transcriptions were performed as described previously by van der Hoorn and Tarnasky (31van der Hoorn F.A. Tarnasky H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32van der Hoorn F.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1093-1099PubMed Google Scholar), using pRT7–0.2C2AT construct as the test promoter and pAdMLP construct as the internal control. Transcription of the constructs generated the expected RNAs of 385 and 190 nucleotides forOdf1 and Ad, respectively. Competitor oligonucleotides (ds or ss) were added to reactions as indicated in the legends. Autoradiograms were scanned by laser densitometry, and transcription levels were normalized using the internal adenovirus major late promoter control and expressed as a percentage of full Odf1promoter activity as described previously (31van der Hoorn F.A. Tarnasky H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Delineation of the testis-specific c-mos (32van der Hoorn F.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1093-1099PubMed Google Scholar) and testis-specific Odf1 (31van der Hoorn F.A. Tarnasky H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) promoters had revealed testis-specific nuclear factor binding sites that are 80% identical and are located at the same distance from the TATA box (at −120) and may therefore bind a common testis-specific nuclear protein that we named TTF-D. To characterize TTF-D and to demonstrate that both Odf1D1 and c-mosD1 oligonucleotides bind the same proteins as suggested by the previous gel retardation assays, UV cross-linking assays were performed. ST nuclear proteins (and, as a control, liver nuclear proteins) were UV cross-linked to radiolabeled oligonucleotides and separated according to size. We observed that testis-specific peptides with approximate molecular masses of 33, 23, and 20 kDa (after subtracting the molecular mass of the oligonucleotides) bind to both oligonucleotide DNAs (Fig.1, lanes b and e, arrows). We had previously shown that the two oligonucleotides could bind a nuclear protein present in somatic cells (24Graves J.A. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Tamura T. Makino Y. Mikoshiba K. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4327-4332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments using liver nuclear extracts show that both oligonucleotides bind a 40-kDa somatic protein (Fig. 1, lanes a and d). As expected, we observe less of this somatic protein when using ST extract (lanes b and e) because seminiferous tubules contain few somatic cells. Formation of all ST-generated complexes can be competed by self-oligonucleotide (data not shown) as well as by cross-competition (Fig. 1, lanes c and f). Odf1D1 oligonucleotide, but not c-mosD1 oligonucleotide, also interacts with the 30- and 32-kDa peptides that are present in somatic cells but not in germ cells. Their origin is unknown. These two proteins do not bind the c-mosD1 oligonucleotide (lane d), and, as expected, they are not efficiently competed by this oligonucleotide (lane b). To independently obtain a more accurate estimation of the molecular masses of the testis-specific peptides that are TTF-D components, we performed a Southwestern blot analysis of two ST extracts and two liver nuclear protein isolates using radiolabeled binding site oligonucleotides as probes. The results obtained with the c-mosD1 and Odf1D1 oligonucleotides are identical (the Odf1D1 results are shown in Fig. 2). Somatic cells contain 38-, 30-, and 32-kDa nuclear factors capable of binding the TTF-D oligonucleotides (Fig. 2, lanes a andb). Male germ cells specifically express 35-, 25-, and 22-kDa-binding peptides (lanes c and d, arrows), in close agreement with our UV cross-linking results. We predicted that if TTF-D binding to the c-mos and Odf1 promoters has physiological significance, then TTF-D must be present in cells that express c-mos and Odf1. The c-mos testis-specific promoter is active in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, and the Odf1 promoter is active in spermatids. In the mouse, pachytene spermatocytes are produced for the first time at days 12–14 after birth, whereas round spermatids are not produced until days 21–22 after birth. To determine whether TTF-D is present in mouse testis at the time of expression of the c-mos andOdf1 genes, nuclear extracts were prepared from total testes of 11-, 16-, 21-, and 25-day-old mice and an adult mouse. These extracts were analyzed for TTF-D activity in gel retardation assays. The results shown in Fig. 3 Ademonstrate that TTF-D activity (indicated by the asterisks) can be detected as early as 11 days after birth (lane a). TTF-D activity is detectable into adulthood (lane e) when a full complement of germ cells is established. The 38-kDa somatic protein that binds the oligonucleotide is present in all total testis extracts (s, lanes a–e), as expected. These experiments show that TTF-D is present at the time of first expression of both the c-mos and Odf1 genes. The increased TTF-D signal likely results from the increased percentage of male germ cells during postnatal development from day 11 onward: control gel retardation assays using SP1 oligonucleotides demonstrated no change in the amount of complex formed (data not shown). To further document the expression of TTF-D in male germ cells before and after meiosis, we performed gel retardation assays using c-mosD1 oligonucleotide as a probe and nuclear proteins isolated from elutriated pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids. The results (Fig. 3 B) show that TTF-D binding activity is detectable in these germ cell types (arrow, lanes g and i, respectively) and that the pattern is similar to that seen using ST extract (lane j). Our previous in vitro transcription studies have shown that theOdf1 promoter region harboring the TTF-D and CREMτ sites acts as a testis-specific cis-acting element (31van der Hoorn F.A.

Transfection experiments and analysis of CREMτ−/−knockout mice have established CREMτ as the major regulator of theOdf1 promoter (13Delmas V. Laoide B.M. Masquilier D. de Groot R.P. Foulkes N.S.

Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The testis-specific c-mospromoter lacks a CREMτ binding site but shares a TTF-D site with theOdf1 promoter. It is weak compared with the Odf1promoter. To demonstrate a role for TTF-D in promoter activation, we analyzed promoter activity in in vitro transcription assays, using ST nuclear extracts with and without an excess of Odf1D1, c-mosD1, and other indicated oligonucleotides as competitors for TTF-D binding. pAdMLP was included in all assays as an internal control. The addition of excess ds Odf1D1 oligonucleotide and ds c-mosD1 oligonucleotide resulted in a reduction of the activity of the Odf1 promoter by approximately 30% (Fig.4, lanes b and d, respectively) in comparison with a competitor oligonucleotide (B oligonucleotide) that had no effect on Odf1 promoter activity (lane e). Interestingly, a related oligonucleotide (D2) also repressed the activity of the Odf1 promoterin vitro (lane c). None of the competitor oligonucleotide DNAs used affected the activity of the adenovirus promoter (compare lane a and lanes b–e). We conclude from these assays that TTF-D acts as a testis-specific, positive transcription factor. In the course of the above-described gel retardation experiments, we observed in preliminary experiments that TTF-D might bind to ss DNA representing its binding site. Therefore, we performed the following studies to determine the specificity of such an interaction, and we asked whether the same TTF-D peptides could bind to ss DNA binding sites. We used ST nuclear proteins and sense and antisense Odf1D1 binding site oligonucleotides in gel retardation assays. In indicated experiments, we included an excess of ss competitor oligonucleotide. The results for the sense and antisense oligonucleotide were essentially identical: those for sense Odf1D1 ss DNA are shown in Fig. 5 A. The results demonstrate that TTF-D binds efficiently to ss oligonucleotide (lane a, asterisks) and that this binding cannot be competed by a large excess of unrelated ss oligonucleotide (B-sense oligonucleotide and B-antisense oligonucleotide, lanes g andh, respectively). Binding to sense oligonucleotide is efficiently competed by ds Odf1D1 oligonucleotide and by sense and antisense self-oligonucleotide (lanes b–d, respectively). Competition was slightly less efficient with ss c-mosD1 oligonucleotides (lanes e and f). UV cross-linking was used to ascertain whether the same or different TTF-D peptides are involved in the binding to ds and ss DNA. The results are shown in Fig. 5 B and indicate that Odf1D1 (lanes i–k) and c-mosD1 (lanes l–n) sense and antisense oligonucleotides bind the same peptides compared with each other and with ds oligonucleotide. In this experiment, the 25-kDa TTF-D component appears resolved in two bands, a result that was not always evident. The increased intensities of the ssDNA-TTF-D complexes (lanes j, k, and n) could result from a greater affinity of TTF-D for those particular ss DNA cognate sites compared with the corresponding ds DNA binding sites. To further define the specificity of binding, we designed mutant Odf1D1 oligonucleotides called MUT1, MUT2, and MUT3 in which the first two, the middle three, or the last three nucleotides of the binding site were changed, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Gel retardation analysis using these mutant oligonucleotides as competitor DNA (Fig.6 A) shows that MUT1 and MUT3 oligonucleotides compete for binding of TTF-D to ss Odf1D1 oligonucleotide (lanes d and f, asterisks), although with reduced efficiency compared with self-oligonucleotide (lane c). MUT2 oligonucleotide did not compete (lane e), nor did the unrelated B oligonucleotide (lane a). Preliminary UV cross-linking experiments showed that the same peptides bind to Odf1D1, MUT1, and MUT3 DNA, but not to MUT2 DNA (data not shown). Thus, mutation of the central three nucleotides abolished TTF-D binding, and mutation of the flanking sequences affected TTF-D binding but did not abolish it. Here we show that ds c-mosD1 and Odf1D1 TTF-D binding site DNA reducedOdf1 promoter activity in vitro. Because we discovered that TTF-D also specifically binds to ss binding site DNA, we set out to determine whether these ss DNAs can repressOdf1 promoter activity. In vitro transcription experiments were carried out using ST nuclear proteins,Odf1, and AdMLP promoter constructs and the indicated sense ss oligonucleotides as competitors for TTF-D binding. The results are shown in Fig. 6 B. This analysis shows that ss Odf1D1, MUT1, MUT3, and D2 oligonucleotides reduce promoter activity by approximately 50% (lanes h, i, k, and l). ss MUT2 and the unrelated ss B oligonucleotides did not significantly affectOdf1 promoter activity in vitro (lanes j and m). Thus, it appears that activation of theOdf1 promoter by TTF-D can be competed specifically by both ds and ss DNA representing the TTF-D binding site. The assays described above demonstrate that a 38-kDa somatic, nuclear protein can interact with the TTF-D binding site. We used ds wild type and mutant DNAs to gather further information on the nucleotides involved. Oligonucleotide DNA was incubated with liver nuclear extract, and the complexes were analyzed in the gel retardation assays shown in Fig.7. The complex between the 38-kDa somatic protein and Odf1D1 ds DNA (s, lane a) can be competed by self-oligonucleotide (lane b) and c-mosD1 oligonucleotide (lane c) but cannot be significantly competed by D2 oligonucleotide (lane d). Because D2 and Odf1D1 only share sequences in the middle region, this shows that either the 5′ or 3′ end of the Odf1D1 oligonucleotide binds the somatic protein. We therefore analyzed whether the mutant oligonucleotides can complex with the somatic protein. The results (Fig. 7) indicate that the 3′ nucleotides in the Odf1D1 sequence are essential for binding, which is abolished by their mutation (lane g). Reduced binding was observed for MUT2 (lane f), suggesting that nucleotides in the middle of the Odf1D1 sequence contribute to the affinity. These results suggest that the binding site for TTF-D and the somatic 38-kDa protein overlap. Transcriptional regulation of genes plays a key role in their tissue- and cell-specific expression. In the testis, with the exception of CREMτ, little is known regarding transcription factors that play a role in the positive or negative regulation of testis-specific genes (10Hecht N.B. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 11Lindsey S. Wilkinson M.F. J. Assist. Reprod. Genet. 1996; 13: 182-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that CREMτ is a regulator of transcription of the post-meiotic testis-specific geneOdf1 (17Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We had previously identified a second putative regulator of Odf1 transcription that we called TTF-D (31van der Hoorn F.A. Tarnasky H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The sequence of the TTF-D binding site was deduced from DNase I footprinting assays and gel retardation experiments and is called Odf1D1 (31van der Hoorn F.A. Tarnasky H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the c-mos promoter, an element that is 80% identical to the Odf1D1 sequence was identified that binds a testis-specific factor that we postulated could be related to or identical to TTF-D (32van der Hoorn F.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1093-1099PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that TTF-D is a testis-specific transcription factor, which binds to both the Odf1D1 oligonucleotide and the c-mosD1 oligonucleotide. Mutational analysis indicates that the central CTT nucleotides in the 5′-GGCCTTAGGG-3′ TTF-D binding site are essential for binding. The flanking GG and AGG nucleotides, however, increase the affinity of TTF-D for its cognate site. TTF-D contains three testis-specific peptides of 22, 25, and 35 kDa that surprisingly bind to both ds and ss Odf1 and c-mos TTF-D binding site oligonucleotides. We do not know the relationship between any of these peptides: it is possible that one is a post-translationally modified version of another one, for instance, by phosphorylation. Importantly, the same peptides bind to both ds and ss versions of the Odf1 and the c-mosTTF-D binding sites. TTF-D activation of Odf1 promoter activity in vitro is reduced by the addition of TTF-D binding site oligonucleotides (both as ds and ss DNA), but not by unrelated or mutant oligonucleotides. Our functional data and binding results with TTF-D strongly suggest that TTF-D plays a role in the transcription of the c-mosand Odf1 testis-specific promoters. The fact that TTF-D can be detected as early as day 11 in germ cell development strengthens such a role for TTF-D in this transcriptional regulation, because c-mos is first detectable in spermatocytes that develop 12–14 days after birth in the mouse. The in vitrotranscription assays that we performed previously (31van der Hoorn F.A. Tarnasky H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32van der Hoorn F.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1093-1099PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the c-mos promoter is weak in comparison to theOdf1 promoter. This finding can be explained by the facts that (a) compared with CREMτ, TTF-D is a weak transacting factor, and (b) it is the only testis-specific factor that binds to the c-mos promoter detectable by DNase I footprint assays (32van der Hoorn F.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1093-1099PubMed Google Scholar). It is more difficult to interpret a role for TTF-D in the regulation of the post-meiotic Odf1 promoter. Clearly, TTF-D is present in pre-meiotic cells that do not express Odf1. One possibility is that the binding of TTF-D to the Odf1promoter does happen in spermatocytes and that this event changes theOdf1 chromatin structure to prepare the Odf1promoter for the binding of CREMτ. In this respect, it is interesting that TTF-D can specifically bind to its ss cognate site. One can envision two models: first, such interactions stabilize ss regions in the Odf1 promoter that are important for the subsequent regulation of activity by CREMτ, and second, TTF-D binding to ss promoter sequences transmits structural signals. The role and mode of action of ss binding transacting factors is not clear at present. Interestingly, Yiu et al. (35Yiu G.K. Murray M.T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 1439-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) recently isolated the mouse testis-specific p54/p56 protein, a homolog of the XenopusFRG Y2 protein (36Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. New Biol. 1992; 4: 349-359PubMed Google Scholar). Testis-specific p54/p56 can also bind mP2 (37Nikolajczyk B.S. Murray M.T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); binding, is preferentially to ss DNA (37Nikolajczyk B.S. Murray M.T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consensus p54/p56 binding sites are present in the testis-specific promoters of the mP1, TP2, PGK-2, and H2B genes (37Nikolajczyk B.S. Murray M.T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Other ss DNA binding, positive transacting factors include Purα (38Zambrano N. De Renzis S. Minopoli G. Faraonio R. Donini V. Scaloni A. Cimino F. Russo T. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), Brn-3a (39Budhram-Mahadeo V. Morris P.J. Lakin N.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5237-5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and FBP (41Davis-Smyth T. Duncan R.C. Zheng T. Michelotti G. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31679-31687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of any of these factors remains to be determined, but these and our data suggest that gene regulation by ss binding transacting factors may be a common theme in spermatogenesis. In an alternative model, TTF-D does not have access to theOdf1 promoter until after meiosis. Future experiments will distinguish these possibilities. TTF-D acts as a testis-specific positive-acting transcription factor for the post-meiotic gene Odf1. We also observed that in addition to TTF-D, a 38-kDa somatic nuclear protein absent from male germ cells binds to the c-mosD1 and Odf1D1 oligonucleotides. The absence of this nuclear protein from male germ cells suggests that it might play a role in repression of the c-mos andOdf1 promoters in somatic cells. This possibility is strengthened by our observation that the binding sites for the somatic protein and TTF-D overlap. This suggests a model in which the binding of the 38-kDa protein to its site blocks the expression of Odf1 and/or c-mos in cells that accidentally ectopically express TTF-D. Such a model, although unproven in this case, is attractive because it has been shown to occur in other systems: one of the mechanisms of action of the Cut homeodomain repressor protein is its ability to block access of the transcriptional activator CTF/NF1 protein to its binding site (42Barberis A. Superti-Furga G. Busslinger M. Cell. 1987; 50: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For this reason, Cut protein had also been named CDP (CCAAT-box displacement factor). The identity of the 38-kDa somatic protein and its putative role in gene regulation remain to be determined.

Transfection experiments have shown that one of these, GRU2 (nucleotide (nt) −121 to −85 and nt −111 to −74 in human and rat promoters, respectively), was on its own able to mediate the glucocorticoid response in rat but not in human species (Suwanichkul, A., Allander, S., Morris, S.

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Robertson D.G. Marino E.M. Thulé P.M. Seneviratne C.K. Murphy L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Suh D.S. Ooi G.T. Rechler M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 794-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A second GRE, located in a more remote 5′-position, is absolutely required for glucocorticoids to stimulate human IGFBP-1 promoter activity (22Suwanichkul A. Allander S. Morris S.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30835-30841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The different abilities of rat and human GRU2 to enhance IGFBP-1 promoter activity in transfected hepatoma cells was unexpected since their nucleotide sequence is highly conserved between both species. However a C to A transition (third base pair in the 3′-half of the GREII imperfect palindrome) creates a GATC tetranucleotide in the rat promoter (GCTC in the human GREII), a tetranucleotide that undergoes deoxyadenosine methylation (N6 position of the adenine residue; dam methylation hereafter) in mostEscherichia coli bacterial strains. In addition,dam methylation of GRE imperfect palindromes that encompass the GATC tetranucleotide confers responsiveness to glucocorticoids in gene transfer experiments (29Truss M. Bartsch J. Chalepakis G. Beato M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1483-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because dam methylation does not occur in eucaryotic cells, we wondered whether the ability of the transfected rat GRU2 to enhance transcription in the presence of glucocorticoids could be due to its methylation in dam + E. coli strains. We thus compared the ability of the rat GRU2 propagated in dam + anddam − E. coli strains to mediate the glucocorticoid response and showed that in the absence of bacterial methylation, the rat GRU2 was unable to sustain a significant glucocorticoid increase in promoter activity, as is the case for its human counterpart. Furthermore, we correlated this differential activity on transcription with the ability of the GR to interact with the methylated or unmethylated rat GREII in vitro. The double-stranded oligonucleotides consisted of rat (nt −111 to −74) and human (nt −121 to −85) sequences from the IGFBP-1 promoter (i.e. encompassing the GREII and IRE cis-elements; IGFBP-1-GRU2 hereafter). They were flanked by HindIII (5′-) and SalI (3′-) cohesive ends. Sequences were as follows: hIGFBP-1-GRU2, 5′-(AGCT)TAGCAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAACACTCAGCTCCTAG(TCGA)-3′; unmethylated rIGFBP-1-GRU2, 5′-(AGCTT)AAGCAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAACACGGGGATCCTAGC(GTCGA)-3′;dam methylated rIGFBP-1-GRU2, upper strand, 5′-(AGCTT)AAGCAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAACACGGGGA mTCCTAGCG-3′; lower strand, 5′-(TCGAC)GCTAGGA mTCCCCGTGTTCAAAATAAGTTTGTTTTGCTTA-3′. In some instances, dam methylation of the unmethylated rIGFBP-1-GRU2 was performed in vitro using recombinantdam methylase (New England Biolabs) and S+-adenosyl-methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rat (nt −111 to −74) and human (nt −121 to −85) IGFBP-1-GRU2 were inserted as cohesive, double-stranded oligonucleotides between the unique HindIII andSalI restriction sites of pBLCAT2, an eucaryotic expression vector in which CAT gene expression is directed by promoter sequences (nt −105 to +51) of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (30Luchow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). This yielded prIGFBP-1-GRU2 and phIGFBP-1-GRU2, respectively, the sequences of which were checked by dideoxy sequencing. pRShGRα, a hGR expression vector, and pRSVLuc, an ubiquitous and constitutive luciferase expression plasmid (Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat upstream of the luciferase cDNA) have been previously described by Hollenberg et al. (31Hollenberg S.M. Giguere V. Segui P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and de Wetet al. (32de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar), respectively. Large scale preparations of the plasmids were obtained from E. coli HB101 (dam +)-transformed bacteria. A dammutant strain (JM110) (Stratagene) was also used to prepare prIGFBP-1-GRU2 unmethylated at dam − methylation sites. NdeI-XhoI DNA fragments of 444 and 442 bp were excised from prIGFBP-1-GRU2 and phIGFBP-1-GRU2, respectively and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragments were restricted with MboI (10 units/μg DNA) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 2 h. This enzyme recognizes GATC palindromes and cleaves exclusively the unmethylated sequence (33Barras F. Marinus M.G. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 139-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The restriction fragments were then end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of T4-polynucleotide kinase. The digestion products were resolved by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. Human hepatoma (HepG2) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-IR) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Rat H4II hepatoma cells were grown in Coon's F12. The culture medium was supplemented with 10% (HepG2, CHO-IR cells) or 5% (H4II cells) fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin), and the cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For transfection experiments, 5 × 105 CHO-IR or 106 HepG2 cells were plated into 60-mm Petri dishes the day before, and the medium was renewed 3 h before transfection. Co-transfection (10 μg of prIGFBP-1-GRU2 or of phIGFBP-1-GRU2, 1 μg of pRSVLuc and 0.125–1 μg of pRShGRα) was performed using calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation (34Chen J. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). 24 h post-transfection, the culture medium was replaced by serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 18 h in the absence or presence of 10−6mdexamethasone. CAT and luciferase activities were assayed according to standard procedures (32de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar, 35Sleigh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). CAT activities were always normalized relative to those of luciferase (an internal monitor of transfection efficiency), and the following CAT/luciferase ratios were used to compute the glucocorticoid induction. glucocorticoid inductionEquation 1 =Normalized CAT activity in cellsco­transfected in the presence of DexNormalized CAT activity in cellsco­transfected in the absence of Dex Growth and infection of Sf9 cells were performed as described previously (36Cadepond F.

Biol. 1994; 48: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 1 μm of triamcinolone acetonide was added to the culture medium 1 h before harvesting cells, and crude nuclear extracts were prepared under high ionic strength conditions (36Cadepond F.

Baulieu E.E. Groyer A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The recombinant glucocorticoid receptor (BachGRα) recovered in the crude nuclear extracts was analyzed for its molecular weight, and its ability to bind glucocorticoids was assessed by the hydroxyapatite method (39Erdos T. Best-Belpomme M. Bessada R. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 72: 244-252Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The binding capacities of the crude nuclear extracts used hereafter were 3,800 pmol/ml (specific activity, 576 pmol/mg protein) or 1,710 pmol/ml (specific activity, 123 pmol/mg protein). The rat (unmethylated or dam methylated) and human IGFBP-1-GRU2 (ds-oligonucleotides or inserts isolated from prIGFBP-1-GRU2 and from phIGFBP-1-GRU2) were end-labeled by filling in using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, and either [α-32P]dATP or [α-33P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP or [α-33P]dCTP. The radiolabeled IGFBP-1-GRU2 were purified by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1 μl of crude nuclear extracts (1.71 or 3.80 pmol of BachGRα, as estimated by steroid binding) was mixed with 2 μg of sonicated salmon or herring sperm DNA (final volume, 12 μl) and incubated at 0 °C for 15 min. 32P- or 33P-labeled rat or human IGFBP-1-GRU2 (final concentrations, cf. legends to Figs. 6and 7) was then added alone or with a 6–120-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (TAT-GREII, unmethylated ordam methylated rat IGFBP-1-GRU2 or human IGFBP-1-GRU2). The final reaction mixture (18 μl: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH = 7.4, 2.2 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 40–60 mm NaCl, 0.125 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bovine serum albumin) was incubated for an additional 60 min at 25 °C, then analyzed on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run in recirculating 0.25× TBE at 0–4 °C. Gels were dried and DNA-protein interactions were visualized by autoradiography (1 h).Figure 7Relative affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor for dam methylated or unmethylated rIGFBP-1 GRU2 and for hIGFBP-1 GRU2. 32P-labeled dammethylated ds-rIGFBP-1-GRU2 (specific activity, 2.40 × 105 cpm/ng; final concentration, 5.35 nm) was incubated with 1 μl of Sf9 crude nuclear extracts (1.71 pmol of hGRα), in the absence or in the presence of unlabeled, competing, ds-oligonucleotide (range, 6–120-fold molar excess). The32P-labeled rIGFBP-1-GRU2-GR complexes were then analyzed by EMSA.

When supershift experiments were to be performed, the 60-min incubation at 25 °C was extended for an additional 20 min, after the addition of a polyclonal anti-GR antibody in the reaction mixture (1 or 2 μl) (40Segard-Maurel I. Rajkowski K. Jibard N. Schweizer-Groyer G. Baulieu E.E. Cadepond F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1634-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was prepared from confluent monolayers of H4II rat hepatoma cells, and 20-μg aliquots were digested either by FokI (5 units/μg DNA) or byMboI (5 units/μg DNA). The restriction fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (2% agarose). The 340-bpHindIII/SalI restriction fragment isolated from phIGFBP-1-GRU2 (i.e. the human IGFBP-1 promoter) was run in parallel as a positive control for hybridization. After electrophoresis, the DNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and hybridized (18 h, 68 °C) with a random-labeled probe that encompassed 5′-flanking sequences from the human IGFBP-1 promoter (nt −340 to +1; 69% sequence similarity with the rat IGBP-1 promoter) (specific activity, 2.7 × 106 cpm/ng; 3 × 106 cpm/ml hybridization buffer). After two washes (15 min at room temperature then 15 min at 50 °C) in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, the membranes were analyzed using an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). The rat (nt −111 to −74) and human (nt −121 to −85) GRU2 are composite cis-elements, in which both the GRE and the IRE (Fig. 1 A) are crucial for promoter activity to be enhanced by glucocorticoids (22Suwanichkul A.

On the basis of transfection experiments, Goswami et al. (23Goswami R. Lacson R. Yang E. Sam R. Unterman T. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and Suh et al. (25Suh D.S. Ooi G.T. Rechler M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 794-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have reported that the rat GRU2 is functional on its own (23Goswami R. Lacson R. Yang E. Sam R. Unterman T. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Robertson D.G. Marino E.M. Thulé P.M. Seneviratne C.K. Murphy L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This is in contrast with the data reported by Suwanichkul et al. (22Suwanichkul A. Allander S. Morris S.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30835-30841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the human GRU2; it is inactive by itself (22Suwanichkul A. Allander S. Morris S.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30835-30841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy would imply that the human and rat promoters are not functionally homologous with regard to the glucocorticoid response, despite high sequence similarity between the two GRUs. The IRE (100% of sequence similarity between the rat and human IGFBP-1 promoters) cannot account for this discrepancy (Fig.1 A). On the contrary the GREIIs differ by 4 bp; two are localized in the 3-bp spacer that separates the half-palindromes, the two others are at positions +1 and +3 (A to G and C to A transitions, respectively) (Fig. 1 B). Both positions are contacted by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), one of which (+3) is essential for high affinity GR-GRE interaction (reviewed in Ref. 41Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C to A transition (+3) creates a GATC tetranucleotide in the rat GREII (boxed in Fig. 1 B). This sequence is methylated on the adenosine residue (N6 position) in most E. coli strains and such dam methylation has been shown to generate artificial GREs (29Truss M. Bartsch J. Chalepakis G. Beato M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1483-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). prIGFBP-1-GRU2 was propagated in either dam − (JM110) ordam + (HB101) E. colistrains. In each case, the NdeI-XhoI fragment (444 bp) was excised, purified, then restricted with MboI, an enzyme that cleaves exclusively the unmethylated GATC sequence, and the restriction fragments were end-labeled (Fig.2). When excised from prIGFBP-1-GRU2 propagated in JM110 the NdeI-XhoI fragment was cleaved by MboI and yielded 172-, 157-, 92-, and 23-bp bands (Fig. 2). These bands were generated by enzymatic cleavage at the three available GATC sequences (one located in the 3′-half-palindrome of rat GREII sequences, the other two being localized in pBLCAT2 vector DNA). On the contrary, when prIGFBP-1-GRU2 was propagated in HB101, theNdeI-XhoI fragment remained uncleaved afterMboI digestion. These results demonstrated that the adenine residue at position +3 of the rat GREII was methylated when prIGFBP-1-GRU2 was propagated in a dam + E. coli strain. When prIGFBP-1-GRU2 was prepared from the widely used HB101 E. coli strain (dam +), then co-transfected in CHO cells with an expression vector encoding the human GR, the rat GRU2 increased CAT reporter gene expression by 6.50 ± 1.05-fold in the presence of glucocorticoids in the culture medium. GRU2 was thus able to enhance transcription from the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter (Fig.3, A and B, GAmTC). On the contrary, when prIGFBP-1-GRU2 was prepared from a dam − bacterial strain (JM110), the hormonal inducibility of CAT reporter gene expression was completely abolished; the slight difference in CAT activities between untreated and dexamethasone-treated cells (1.48 ± 0.23-fold) was not statistically significant (Fig. 3, A and B, GATC). These results allowed the conclusions that only thedam methylated prIGFBP-1-GRU2 mediated significant glucocorticoid induction and that such a hormonal inducibility was dependent on adenosyl methylation of the GATC motif of the rat GREII. As a matter of fact, glucocorticoid induction was not obtained with phIGFBP-1-GRU2 (vide infra), which does not contain any GATC in the human GREII but encompasses the GATCs present in pBLCAT2 DNA, the latter being methylated after propagation in the HB101 (dam +) E. coli strain (theNdeI-XhoI fragment excised from phIGFBP-1-GRU2 was not restricted by MboI; Fig. 2). When such co-transfection experiments were performed in the presence of varying amounts of pRShGRα (range 0.125 to 1 μg), the magnitude of glucocorticoid effect was dose-dependent, pointing to GR dependence and was always greater in the dam methylated series (Fig. 4). Because the rat GRU2 encompasses an IRE that, as is the case for its human counterpart (27Neau E. Chambéry D. Schweizer-Groyer G. Cadepond F. Jibard N. Groyer A. Prog.
