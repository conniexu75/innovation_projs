https://openalex.org/W2093573816,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subserves synaptic glutamate-induced transmission and plasticity in central neurons. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to show that the cytoplasmic tails of NMDA receptor subunits interact with a prominent postsynaptic density protein PSD-95. The second PDZ domain in PSD-95 binds to the seven-amino acid, COOH-terminal domain containing the terminal tSXV motif (where S is serine, X is any amino acid, and V is valine) common to NR2 subunits and certain NR1 splice forms. Transcripts encoding PSD-95 are expressed in a pattern similar to that of NMDA receptors, and the NR2B subunit co-localizes with PSD-95 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The interaction of these proteins may affect the plasticity of excitatory synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2012927918,"ERS (ethylene response sensor), a gene in the Arabidopsis thaliana ethylene hormone-response pathway, was uncovered by cross-hybridization with the Arabidopsis ETR1 gene. The deduced ERS protein has sequence similarity with the amino-terminal domain and putative histidine protein kinase domain of ETR1, but it does not have a receiver domain as found in ETR1. A missense mutation identical to the dominant etr1-4 mutation was introduced into the ERS gene. The altered ERS gene conferred dominant ethylene insensitivity to wild-type Arabidopsis. Double-mutant analysis indicates that ERS acts upstream of the CTR1 protein kinase gene in the ethylene-response pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2059938714,"Activation of early response genes by interferons (IFNs) requires tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins. It was found that the serine-threonine kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [specifically, the 42-kilodalton MAPK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2)] interacted with the alpha subunit of IFN-alpha/beta receptor in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of cells with IFN-beta induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAPK and caused MAPK and Stat1 alpha to coimmunoprecipitate. Furthermore, expression of dominant negative MAPK inhibited IFN-beta-induced transcription. Therefore, MAPK appears to regulate IFN-alpha and IFN-beta activation of early response genes by modifying the Jak-STAT signaling cascade."

https://openalex.org/W2025159406,"The chemokine RANTES induced biphasic mobilization of Ca2+ in T cells. The initial peak, a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ mediated by a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)--coupled pathway, was associated predominantly with chemotaxis. The second peak, Ca2+ release and sustained influx dependent on protein tyrosine kinases, was associated with a spectrum of cellular responses--Ca2+ channel opening, interleukin-2 receptor expression, cytokine release, and T cell proliferation--characteristic of T cell receptor activation. Other chemokines did not produce these responses. Thus, in addition to inducing chemotaxis, RANTES can act as an antigen-independent activator of T cells in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2053794249,Developmental changes in rat hippocampal transmitter release and synaptic plasticity were investigated. Recordings from pairs of pyramidal neurons in slices showed that an action potential in a CA3 neuron released only a single quantum of transmitter onto a CA1 neuron. Failures of synaptic transmission reflected probabilistic transmitter release. The probability of release (Pr) was 0.9 in 4- to 8-day-old rats and decreased to less than 0.5 at 2 to 3 weeks. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in 2- to 3-week-old rats was associated with an increase in Pr from a single synaptic site. The high initial Pr in 4- to 8-day-old rats normally occludes the expression of LTP at this stage.

https://openalex.org/W2043734986,"Description of the genetic structure of malaria parasite populations is central to an understanding of the spread of multiple-locus drug and vaccine resistance. The Plasmodium falciparum mating patterns from Madang, Papua New Guinea, where intense transmission of malaria occurs, are described here. A high degree of inbreeding occurs in the absence of detectable linkage disequilibrium. This contrasts with other studies, indicating that the genetic structure of malaria parasite populations is neither clonal nor panmictic but will vary according to the transmission characteristics of the region."

https://openalex.org/W2009685908,"AS is evident from the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic, there is no systematic method for producing a vaccine. Genetic immunization1is a new approach to vaccine production that has many of the advantages of live/attenuated pathogens but no risk of infection. It involves introducing DNA encoding a pathogen protein into host cells and has shown promise in several disease models2á¤-13. Here we describe a new method for vaccine development, expression-library immunization, which makes use of the technique of genetic immunization and the fact that all the antigens of a pathogen are encoded in its DNA. An expression library of pathogen DNA is used to immunize a host thereby producing the effects of antigen presentation of a live vaccine without the risk. We show that even partial expression libraries made from the DNA of Mycoplasma pulmonis, a natural pathogen in rodents, provide protection against challenge from the pathogen. Expression library immunization may prove to be a general method for vaccination against any pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2025700116,"NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors are selectively localized at the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain. The molecular mechanisms underlying this localization were investigated by expressing the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in fibroblasts. NR1 splice variants containing the first COOH-terminal exon cassette (NR1A and NR1D) were located in discrete, receptor-rich domains associated with the plasma membrane. NR1 splice variants lacking this exon cassette (NR1C and NR1E) were distributed throughout the cell, with large amounts of NR1 protein present in the cell interior. Insertion of this exon cassette into the COOH-terminus of the GluR1 AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptor was sufficient to cause GluR1 to be localized to discrete, receptor-rich domains. Furthermore, protein kinase C phosphorylation of specific serines within this exon disrupted the receptor-rich domains. These results demonstrate that amino acid sequences contained within the NR1 molecule serve to localize this receptor subunit to discrete membrane domains in a manner that is regulated by alternative splicing and protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2002741066,"In skeletal muscle cells, calcium release to trigger contraction occurs at triads, specialized junctions where sarcoplasmic reticulum channels are opened by voltage sensors in the transverse tubule. Scanning confocal microscopy was used in cells under voltage clamp to measure the concentration of intracellular calcium, [Ca2+]i, at individual triads and [Ca2+]i gradients that were proportional to calcium release. In cells stimulated with small depolarizations, the [Ca2+]i gradients broke down into elementary events, corresponding to single-channel currents of about 0.1 picoampere. Because these events were one-tenth to one-fifth the size of calcium sparks (elementary release events of cardiac muscle), skeletal muscle control mechanisms appear to be fundamentally different."
https://openalex.org/W2115008322,"Fertilization is initiated by the species-specific binding of sperm to the extracellular coat of the egg. One sperm receptor for the mouse egg is beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalTase), which binds O-linked oligosaccharides on the egg coat glycoprotein ZP3. ZP3 binding induces acrosomal exocytosis through the activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein). The cytoplasmic domain of sperm surface GalTase bound to and activated a heterotrimeric G protein complex that contained the Gi alpha subunit. Aggregation of GalTase by multivalent ligands elicited G protein activation. Sperm from transgenic mice that overexpressed GalTase had higher rates of G protein activation than did wild-type sperm, which rendered transgenic sperm hypersensitive to their ZP3 ligand. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of cell surface GalTase appears to enable it to function as a signal-transducing receptor for extracellular oligosaccharide ligands."

https://openalex.org/W1981602827,"The condensation of chemical species of high molecular mass such as methane, ammonia, and water can inhibit convection in the hydrogen-helium atmospheres of the giant planets. Convection is inhibited in Uranus and Neptune when methane reaches an abundance of about 15 times the solar value and in Jupiter and Saturn if the abundance of water is more than about five times the solar value. The temperature gradient consequently becomes superadiabatic, which is observed in temperature profiles inferred from radio-occultation measurements. The planetary heat flux is then likely to be transported by another mechanism, possibly radiation in Uranus, or diffusive convection."

https://openalex.org/W2014022170,"This article describes recent developments in the strongest evidence linking electromagnetic field exposure to cancers. Work suggesting that low-level EMF exposure can dramatically affect the workings of the Myc gene, an oncogene implicated in a host of human cancers, has been called into doubt. Two elaborate attempts to relicate the findings (Saffer and Thurston; Hasketh) have failed completely although the orginal researcher says they have still failed to replicate her protocaol in the original experiment exactly. She and her co-researcher (Goodman and Henderson) continue to report positive links between EMF and Myc RNA increases."
