https://openalex.org/W2156891333,"Selective nuclear import is mediated by nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and cognate transport factors known as karyopherins or importins. Karyopherin alpha recognizes ""classical"" monopartite and bipartite NLSs. We report the crystal structure of a 50 kDa fragment of the 60 kDa yeast karyopherin alpha, in the absence and presence of a monopartite NLS peptide at 2.2 A and 2.8 A resolution, respectively. The structure shows a tandem array of ten armadillo repeats, organized in a right-handed superhelix of helices. Binding of the NLS peptide occurs at two sites within a helical surface groove that is lined by conserved residues. The structure reveals the determinants of NLS specificity and suggests a model for the recognition of bipartite NLSs."
https://openalex.org/W2039458025,"Smad proteins have been identified as mediators of intracellular signal transduction by members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, which affect cell proliferation, differentiation, as well as pattern formation during early vertebrate development. Following receptor activation, Smads are assembled into heteromeric complexes consisting of a pathway-restricted Smad and the common Smad4 that are subsequently translocated into the nucleus where they are thought to play an important role in gene transcription. Here we report the identification of Smad Binding Elements (SBEs) composed of the sequence CAGACA in the promoter of theJunB gene, an immediate early gene that is potently induced by TGF-β, activin, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2. TwoJunB SBEs are arranged as an inverted repeat that is transactivated in response to Smad3 and Smad4 co-overexpression and shows inducible binding of a Smad3- and Smad4-containing complex in nuclear extracts from TGF-β-treated cells. Bacterial-expressed Smad proteins bind directly to the SBE. Multimerization of the SBE creates a powerful TGF-β-inducible enhancer that is also responsive to activin and BMPs. The identification of the sequence CAGACA as a direct binding site for Smad proteins will facilitate the identification of regulatory elements in genes that are activated by members of the TGF-β superfamily.

AP-1 components are immediate early gene products whose expression is rapidly induced by a variety of extracellular stimuli and are encoded by the Fos and Jun families of genes that have been shown to be involved in growth control and differentiation (2Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 128-157Google Scholar). JunB differs in biological properties from its homologs and appears to be a negative regulator of AP-1 function (3Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This functional difference is because of a small number of amino acid changes in its DNA binding and dimerization motifs compared with the corresponding c-Jun sequences, as well as to differences in phosphorylation status in response to mitogenic stimulation (4Nikolakaki E.

In this respect,JunB is a member of the group of genes that are known to be induced in response to TGF-β stimulation, which further include the cyclin-dependent inhibitors (CDI) p15 and p21 (9Li J.-M.

Billadello J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1092-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that control, in part, cell cycle progression and extracellular matrix remodeling in response to TGF-β, respectively. However, it is presently unclear whether the induction of these genes by TGF-β and related factors involves a direct mechanism. TGF-β family members exert their cellular effects (12Roberts A.B.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) by binding to transmembrane receptors that possess serine/threonine kinase activity (14Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, a heteromeric receptor complex consisting of two type II and two type I receptors is formed. Within the complex, the type I receptor is phosphorylated and activated by the type II receptor constitutively active kinase. Genetic studies inDrosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have recently led to the identification of a conserved family of proteins termed Smads that play an important role in intracellular signal transduction of serine/threonine kinase receptors (15Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1998; 390: 465-471Crossref Scopus (3348) Google Scholar). At present, at least nine family members have been identified in vertebrates. Smads are 40–62-kDa proteins with N- and C-terminal homology domains (MH1 and MH2) connected by a proline-rich linker. Smad1, Smad5, and presumably MADH6/Smad9 associate with and are phosphorylated after BMP-mediated BMP-RI and ActR-I activation, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated after TGF-βR-I and ActR-IB activation. Following phosphorylation, which occurs at a conserved SSXS motif at the extreme C termini, these pathways-restricted Smads form heteromeric complexes with the common mediator SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. Phosphorylation of the proline linker by growth factor-activated Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase was recently shown to have an inhibitory effect on BMP-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad1 (16Kretschmar M. Doody J. Massagu 74. J Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Smad6 and Smad7 are structurally and functionally distinct from other Smads in that they lack an MH1 domain and act opposite to the pathway-restricted and common mediator Smads; they block the activation of pathway-restricted signals by competition for receptor association or by preventing heteromeric complex formation between pathway-restricted and common mediator Smads (17Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 18Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Mor 74 n Nakayama T. Christian J.L.

Support for a role of Smads as transcription factors has been obtained from a number of studies. The C-terminal domains of Smad1 and Smad4 have transactivation activity when fused to the Gal4-DNA binding domain in a Gal4-reporter transactivation assay (20Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. C<rcamo Harland R.M. Massagu J Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 21Meerseman G. Verschuren K. Nelles K. Blumenstock C. Kraft H. Wuytens G. Remacle J. Kozak C.A. Tylzanowski P. Niehrs C. Huylebroeck D. Mech. Dev. 1997; 61: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Smad2 and Smad4 together with Fast-1, a winged-helix DNA binding protein, associate into activin response factor (ARF) that binds to the activin response element of the Xenopus laevis Mix.2 promoter (22Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 23Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). TGF-β as well as Smad3 and Smad4 overexpression transactivate the PAI-1 and p3TP-lux promoters (24Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), which has been attributed to potentiation of AP-1-dependent transcription activation (25Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, Drosophila Mad domain binds a G+C-rich sequence in the Drosophila vestigial quadrant enhancer (26Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). However, these investigations have not been conclusive regarding the role of Smads in transcriptional activation, as well as regarding the sequences with which they interact. In this report, we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the immediate early gene JunB by TGF-β. Transient overexpression of Smad3 and Smad4 with various JunB promoter constructs led to the identification of a region in the upstream part of the promoter that is both Smad-transactivated and shows TGF-β-induced binding of a Smad-containing complex. Further characterization led to the identification of an inverted hexanucleotide repeated sequence binding a TGF-β-induced DNA binding activity. Multimerization of this sequence created a powerful TGF-β-inducible enhancer. Implications of these findings for Smad DNA binding and transcriptional activation will be discussed. An 8-kilobase EcoRI fragment was isolated from the Balb/c mouse genomic JunBclone λ31 which has been described previously (27de Groot R.P. Auwerx J. Karperien M. Staels B. Kruijer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All sequences upstream from the initiator ATG were cloned in the pGL3-basic reporter vector (Promega). For cloning purposes, the ATG was converted to ATC by PCR (pJB1). A deletion series was constructed by restriction digestion of the pJB1 plasmid with EcoRI-PinAI (pJB2),SacI (pJB3), SacI-BssHII (pJB4), orSacI-SacII (pJB5) and subsequent self-ligation. A minimal promoter construct (pGL3ti) was made from pGL3-basic by inserting oligonucleotides carrying the adenovirus major late promoter TATA box (AdTu, gatctGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTAGGGGgagct, and AdTl, cCCCCTACCCCCTTTTATAGCCCCa) and the mouse terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase gene initiator sequence (Tiu, cGCCCTCATTCTGGAGACAg, and Til, gatccTGTCTCCAGAATGAGGGCgagct) in the BglII site. A deletion series (pJB11–17) was constructed as follows: anAsp718-BseAI (−3004/−1561) fragment from pJB3 was inserted into the Asp718-XmaCI sites from pGL3ti (pJB11), a T4 DNA polymerase-bluntedSacI-BamHI fragment from pJB3 was inserted in theSmaI site of pGL3ti (pJB12), aBamHI-BglII fragment from pJB11 was inserted into the BglII site of pGL3ti (pJB13), pJB12 was restriction-digested with Asp718-PvuII orPvuII-BglII and subsequently blunted and self-ligated (pJB14 and pJB15, respectively), pJB15 was restriction digested with Asp718-MluNI and subsequently blunted and self-ligated (pJB17), and pJB11 was digested withMluNI and BglII and subsequently blunted and self-ligated (pJB16). For fine mapping of the Smad3 and Smad4 response site in the −2908/−2611 region, pJB15 was used as template for PCR reactions with the Til oligonucleotide and the upper strand of oligonucleotide D (see “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays”). The PCR product was restriction-digested with SacI and ligated into an Asp718-digested and blunted,SacI-digested pGL3ti vector (pGL3ti-DPv). pGL3ti-PsPv and pGL3ti-AfPv were constructed by digestion of pJB15 withAsp718-PstI orAsp718-AflII, blunting and self-ligation. The internal deletion series was constructed as follows: aPstI/PvuII fragment (−2762/−2611) from pJB12 was cloned into the PstI and EcoRV sites of pBluescript SKII- (pSK-PsPv). Next, pJB15 was used as template for PCR reactions with the upper strand of oligonucleotide A and the lower strands of oligonucleotides C, D, and G. The PCR products were cloned into the SmaI site of pSK-PsPv. The resulting plasmids were restriction-digested with XbaI andSalI, and the fusion fragments were inserted intoNheI-XhoI-opened pGL3ti. pGL3ti-(SBE)4 was constructed by inserting two WT oligonucleotides (see “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays”) into the XhoI site of pGL3ti. All constucts were verified by sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of the −2908/−2611MluNI/PvuII Smad-responsive region appeared to differ at several positions from a previously deposited JunBgenomic sequence (GenBank accession number U20735). The nucleotide sequence of this region as determined by us has been deposited in the EBI Data Bank (accession number AJ004891). Smad expression plasmids were constructed as follows: pSG5-XMAD1 and pSG5-XMAD2 were created by inserting EcoRI fragments from pSP64TEN-DOT1 and -DOT2 intoEcoRI-opened pSG5, pSG5-hSmad3f was created by inserting a blunted BamHI-SalI fragment from pRK5-hSmad3f into blunted BamHI-opened pSG5, and pSG5-hSmad4 was created by inserting a blunted BamHI-EcoRI fragment from pDPC-wt3 into blunted EcoRI-BamHI-opened pSG5. The expression plasmid for Flag-Smad1, Smad2, Myc-Smad3, and Smad4 were described previously (28Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). For the production of bacterially produced GST-Smad fusion proteins, inserts were generated by PCR and cloned in the pGEX4T-1 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). GST-Smad1ΔMH2 (residues 1–269), GST-Smad2ΔMH2 (residues 1–272), GST-Smad3ΔMH2 (residues 1–229), GST-Smad4ΔMH2 (residues 1–321), and GST-Smad5ΔMH2 (residues 1–269) contained MH1 plus linker regions of Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad5, respectively. P19EC embryonal carcinoma cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (Integro, Zaandam, The Netherlands). NIH3T3 embryonic fibroblast cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). HaCaT human keratinocytes, HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, MDA-MB468 (obtained from ATCC) breast cancer cells and Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All media were further supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1× MEM nonessential amino acids. For transient transfection, cells were seeded at 5 × 104 (P19) or 2.5 × 105 (HepG2 and MDA-MB468) cells per well of a 6-well tissue culture cluster. The next day, cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. After 24 h, the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 0.3% fetal calf serum. Simultaneously, the cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D Systems), 20 ng/ml activin A, 100 ng/ml Osteogenic Protein-1 (OP-1), 100 ng/ml BMP2, or 200 ng/ml Growth/Differentiation Factor 5 (GDF5) for 16 h. The cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega), followed by measurement of luciferase activity using luciferase assay system (Promega). In all transfections, β-galactosidase expression plasmids (pDM2LacZ (29Boer P.H. Potten H. Adra C.N. Jardine K. Mulhoffer G. McBurney M.W. Biochem. Genet. 1990; 28: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or pCH110, Pharmacia) served as internal controls to normalize the luciferase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified in 100 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.67 mg/ml O-nitrophenylgalactopyranoside. Each transfection was carried out in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Mv1Lu cells using a modified Dignam protocol as described previously (30Jonk L.J.C. de Jonge M.E.J. Pals C.E.G.M. Wissink S. Vervaart J.M.A. Schoorlemmer J. Kruijer W. Mech. Dev. 1994; 47: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides and dephosphorylated restriction fragments were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Oligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments are shown in SchemeFS1. Binding reactions contained 4 μg of nuclear extract, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) and approximately 10.000 cpm labeled probe and 500-fold molar excess of competitor oligonucleotide where appropriate. Protein binding was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature. Then 20% Ficoll was added to the reactions, and samples were immediately loaded onto 4.5 or 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× TBE. Smad3 and Smad4 antibodies (DHQ and HPP, respectively) (28Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) were added undiluted at 0.5 μl, after proteins were allowed to bind the probe for 15 min. Samples were then incubated for 15 min before loading onto the gel. GST fusion protein expression was induced in logarithmically growing cultures of Escherichia coli (TG1) by the addition of isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and growing the bacteria at 30 °C for an additional 5 h. Bacteria suspended in 50 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline were sonicated, mixed with 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Subsequently, an extract containing GST fusion protein was mixed with 0.25% glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) and incubated at 4 °C under the constant agitation for 12 h. The beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, and then eluted three times with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) including 10 mm glutathione. After the dialysis of eluates with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mmdithiothreitol and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the sample was stored at −70 °C until used. GST fusion proteins were mixed with the binding buffer consisting of 20% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 30 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm sodium phosphate, 4 mm spermidine, 0.3 μg/μl poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia), and 0.25 nm32P-labeled probe at the final volume of 20 μl. When necessary, 500-fold molar excess of the cold competitor was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h and run on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE as the running buffer. Previously, we have shown that the immediate early geneJunB is a direct target for transcription activation in response to activation of signal transduction by TGF-β (5de Groot R.P. Kruijer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1991; 168: 1074-1081Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of transactivation of the JunBpromoter by TGF-β, a JunB promoter-luciferase reporter construct was made containing the JunB TATA box and transcription start site, the complete 5′-untranslated region as well as approximately 6.4 kilobases of promoter upstream sequences (pJB1). Transient transfection of this construct in NIH3T3, Mv1Lu, and HepG2 cells and treatment of the cells with TGF-β did not result in a significant increase in activation of the luciferase reporter construct over uninduced levels after normalization with β-galactosidase activities from cotransfected control LacZ expression plasmid (data not shown). Recently, we and others have shown that transiently overexpressed Smad proteins transactivate target genes in a ligand-independent manner (24Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 28Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). We therefore cotransfected pJB1 with plasmids expressing individual Smads or combinations of each pathway-restricted Smad and Smad4 into NIH3T3 cells (Fig.1 A). A 3- to 5-fold activation of the reporter construct was observed when Smads 1, 2, and 3 were co-expressed with Smad4 while individual Smads did not significantly activate the reporter. Similar results were obtained using P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and HepG2 cells. We localized the Smad-responsive region in the JunB promoter by transfecting cells with a series of deletion constructs along with Smad3 and Smad4, which is the strongest activating combination (see Fig. 1 A). This analysis showed that the Smad-responsive region is located between nucleotides −3004 and −1534; whereas pJB3 has Smad inducibility very similar to pJB1, this response was lost for the JB4 deletion construct (Fig. 1 B). A nested set of restriction fragments was derived from this Smad-responsive region and cloned in front of a heterologous minimal promoter fused to the luciferase gene. Cotransfection of these constructs with Smad3 and Smad4 expression plasmids allowed localization of a Smad-responsive region to between nucleotides −2908 and −2611 (Fig. 1 C). The position of the Smad-responsive element within the −2908/−2611 region was determined using a series of progressive 5′ and internally deleted constructs. Deletion of sequences upstream from nt −2813 did not affect Smad responsiveness while additional deletion of 26 bp (to nt −2787) abrogated inducibility. This analysis was complemented by a series of deletions of sequences located between nt −2908 and −2762. Exclusion of sequences upstream from nt −2792 abrogated transactivation by Smad3 and Smad4 (Fig. 1 D). This analysis therefore defines the 22-base pair region between −2813 and −2792 as that minimally required for transactivation by Smad3 and Smad4. Interestingly, the 22-bp sequence contains a perfect 7-bp inverted repeat (CAGACAGtCTGTCTG). To investigate whether TGF-β induces binding of nuclear proteins to the Smad-responsive region, we succesively incubated labeled probes containing nt −2908 to −2611, nt −2908 to −2788, and nt −2813 to −2792 with nuclear extracts from TGF-β-treated or -untreated Mv1Lu, HaCaT, and NIH3T3 cells cells (Fig. 2). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments showed that extracts from TGF-β-treated cells contain an induced DNA binding activity that migrates with a lower mobility than that of a constitutively expressed binding entity. These results suggest that TGF-β activates the endogenous JunBgene by inducing binding of a nuclear factor to a JunBpromoter distal element located between nucleotides −2813 and −2792. This fragment correlates with the minimal region required for transactivation by Smad3 and Smad4, suggesting that Smads may form part of nuclear complexes that bind to the 22-bp JunB promoter sequence. To analyze whether Smads are present in nuclear complexes that bind to the 22-bp JunB promoter sequence, antisera directed against Smad3 or Smad4 were added to the binding reactions of the 22-bp JunB probe with nuclear extracts (Fig.2 C). Both Smad3 and Smad4 antisera supershifted the slowest migrating TGF-β-induced complex. The Smad3 antiserum was more effective than the Smad4 antiserum, which might be due to intrinsic higher affinity of Smad3 antiserum versus Smad4 antiserum. Both antisera produced a supershifted band with extracts from uninduced cells. Possibly, these complexes were formed by stabilization by the antisera of the interaction of contaminating cytoplasmic Smads with the probe. Neither Smad1, 2, or 5 antiserum produced supershifted bands (data not shown). These results indicate that TGF-β induces nuclear translocation of activated Smad3 and Smad4 and their subsequent binding to a defined region in the JunB promoter. Having identified Smad3 and Smad4 as components of the TGF-β-induced complexes, we next investigated whether Smad proteins directly bind the Smad-responsive fragment. We produced C-terminal truncated (ΔMH2) and full-length Smads 1–5 as GST fusion proteins and analyzed these for their ability to bind the 120-bp MluNI/AflII (−2908/−2788) fragment (Fig.3 A). Smad3ΔMH2 and Smad4ΔMH2 strongly interacted with the probe while binding of C-terminal truncated Smads 1, 2, and 5 to the 120-bp fragment was below the threshold of detection. Binding of full-length Smad4, but not Smad3 fusion protein, was observed, indicating that Smad3 requires a modification or a conformational change to demonstrate its DNA binding potential. These results show that Smad3 and Smad4 bind directly to their target sequence in the 120-bp JunB promoter fragment. We subsequently tested a series of partially overlapping oligonucleotides (Scheme FS1, oligos A, B,C, D, and G) corresponding to the 120-bp fragment for Smad3 and Smad4 binding (Fig. 3, B andC). GST-Smad3ΔMH2 and to a lesser extent GST-Smad4ΔMH2 bound oligonucleotides D and G, whereas oligonucleotide A weakly interacted with GST-Smad3ΔMH2. These results identify the region of overlap between oligosD and G as the major binding site and oligoA as the minor Smad binding site. When comparing the sequence of oligonucleotides A, D, andG, we noted a hexameric CAGACA sequence that was present once in oligonucleotide A and twice in the 7-bp inverted repeat in oligonucleotides D and G. Thus, bacterial-produced Smad3 and Smad4 bind the same 22-bp region that was found to be transactivated by Smad3 and Smad4 and that showed TGF-β-inducible Smad binding. We will refer to this CAGACA sequence as the Smad binding element (SBE). To identify bases in the SBE that are important for Smad3 and Smad4 binding, we tested the efficiency of binding of Smad3 and Smad4 to direct repeats of the SBE or mutated versions thereof in which each repeat carried a different substitution of one of the base pairs of the 7 bp of the inverted dimeric SBE (Fig.4 A). The direct repeat and the inverted repeat bound Smad3 and Smad4 equally well (data not shown). The order of binding strength of Smad proteins to the oligonucleotides was as follows: WT = M7 > M6 > M1 > M2 > M4 > M3 = M5. Complementary experiments in which the binding of GST-Smad proteins was challenged by incubation with excess unlabeled wild type or mutant oligonucleotides as competitors yielded results with similar affinity differences between wild type and mutant probes (Fig. 4 B). Essentially the same results were obtained for binding of proteins from nuclear extracts, which include Smad3 and Smad4, isolated from TGF-β-induced cells to the 22-bp inverted repeat-containing probe (data not shown). When we tested the Smad binding to a probe containing four directly repeated SBEs, we found that Smad3ΔMH2, Smad4ΔMH2, and full-length Smad4 bound with much higher affinity than two repeats (Fig. 4 C). The same results were obtained when the SBEs were present as two indirect repeats ("

The enzyme is involved in the maturation and degradation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides, which relate to the induction of amnesia. The 1.4 Å resolution crystal structure is presented here. The enzyme contains a peptidase domain with an α/β hydrolase fold, and its catalytic triad (Ser554, His680, Asp641) is covered by the central tunnel of an unusual β propeller. This domain makes prolyl oligopeptidase an oligopeptidase by excluding large structured peptides from the active site. In this way, the propeller protects larger peptides and proteins from proteolysis in the cytosol. The structure is also obtained with a transition state inhibitor, which may facilitate drug design to treat memory disorders."

We show here that this phosphatase also plays an important role in the control of cell spreading, migration, and cytoskeletal architecture. Fibroblast cells lacking a functional Shp-2 were impaired in their ability to spread and migrate on fibronectin compared with wild-type cells. Furthermore, Shp-2 mutant cells displayed an increased number of focal adhesions and condensed F-actin aggregation at the cell periphery, properties reminiscent of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-deficient cells. This is consistent with our previous observations in vivo that mice homozygous for the Shp-2 mutation died at midgestation with similar phenotype to FAK and fibronectin-deficient embryos, having severe defects in mesodermal patterning, particularly the truncation of posterior structures. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that FAK dephosphorylation was significantly reduced in Shp-2 mutant cells in suspension. Furthermore, regulated association of Src SH2 domain with FAK and paxillin during cell attachment and detachment on fibronectin was disrupted in Shp-2 mutant cells.

It was previously thought that FAK might have a primary role in the formation of focal adhesion, based on the cellular localization of activated FAK at focal adhesion sites (14Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies suggest that FAK is more likely to modulate the turnover of focal adhesion and to regulate cell migration. FAK-deficient cells exhibited an elevated number of focal adhesions accompanied by a decreased rate of cell migration (15Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Overexpression of FAK augmented cell migration and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, whereas inactivation of FAK suppressed cell migration and proliferation (16Cary L.A. Chang J.F.

Integrins, whereas acting as a bridge between ECM and cytoskeleton, might also transduce biochemical signals into cells. PTKs, such as Src and FAK, seem to be important players in integrin-initiated signaling (14Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This model would predict the requirement for protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in the regulation of signals downstream of integrins. However, a role of a specific cytoplasmic PTP has not been documented in this process. Shp-2 is a widely expressed cytoplasmic PTP that contains two tandem SH2 domains at the NH2 terminus (21Feng G.S. Pawson T. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 54-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that Shp-2 is the mammalian homologue of the gene product of Drosophila corkscrew (Csw), which also encodes a SH2-containing PTP. Csw participates in signaling downstream of the Torso and Sevenless receptor PTKs, as revealed by genetic analyses in Drosophila (23Perkins L.A. Larsen I. Perrimon N.

Simon M.A. Development ( Camb. ). 1996; 122: 1137-1146PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies in mammalian cells suggested that Shp-2 might participate in transmission of signals from growth factor receptors (25Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T.

To define the biological function of mammalian Shp-2, a targeted mutation was introduced into the murine Shp-2 locus in embryonic stem (ES) cells that results in a deletion of exon 3, encoding for amino acid residues 46–110 in the NH2-terminal SH2 (SH2-N) domain of Shp-2 (31Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Homozygous Shp-2 mutant mice die around day 8.5–10.5 of gestation, with multiple defects in mesodermal patterning. Notably, the abnormalities of mesodermal patterning in Shp-2−/− animals are similar to the phenotype of FAK- and fibronectin (FN)-deficient embryos (32Furuta Y. Ilic D. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1989-1995PubMed Google Scholar, 33George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development ( Camb. ). 1993; 119: 1079-1091PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Shp-2 and FAK were in a common signaling pathway controlling cell motility. In this report, we present evidence that Shp-2 plays a critical role in the regulation of cell spreading, migration, and cytoskeletal organization. Wild-type (Shp-2+/+), heterozygous and homozygous Shp-2 mutant (Shp-2+/− and Shp-2−/−) embryonic fibroblast cell lines were described in detail previously (34Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) against FAK was kindly provided by Dr. J. T. Parsons (University of Virginia) and also purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal antibodies against FAK and Shp-2, mAbs against phosphotyrosine (PY20), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled secondary anti-mouse IgG and mAb against vinculin were obtained from Sigma. mAb against paxillin was purchased from Transduction Laboratories, and mAbs to α5 and β1 integrins were from PharMingen, Inc. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Fibroblast cells were collected by trypsinization and washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.2% soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cell spreading was assessed as described previously (35Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 105) were resuspended in DMEM and added to 30-mm tissue culture dishes that were precoated with FN (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were allowed to spread for the indicated times at 37 °C, chilled on ice for 10 min, and then photographed. Spread cells were defined as cells with extended processes, lacking a rounded morphology and not phase-bright, whereas nonspread cells were rounded and phase-bright under microscope. Fibroblast cells collected upon trypsinization were washed in serum-free DMEM containing 0.2% trypsin inhibitor. Cells were resuspended at 106 cells/ml in DMEM, and 100 μl was added to each well of 96-well plates that had been coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml FN and blocked with bovine serum albumin (1 μg/ml). To allow cell attachment, these plates were incubated for certain period of times at 37 °C in CO2incubator. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing with PBS, and attached cells were then stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol. After washing with PBS, crystal violet staining was eluted with 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 4.2), and the optical absorbency was measured at 595 nm using a microplate reader (36Zhang Z. Morla A.O. Vuori K. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cell migration was determined using modified chambers containing polycarbonate membranes (tissue culture-treated, 6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pores, transwell; Costar, Cambridge, MA) (16Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both sides of the membrane were coated with FN (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Trypsinized cells were first washed once with DMEM containing 0.2% soybean trypsin inhibitor and then washed twice with DMEM. Cells were added to the upper chamber at 6 × 104 cells/well, and the lower chamber was filled with DMEM containing 4 μg/ml of FN. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times, the membrane was fixed in methanol, and cells on the upper surface were mechanically removed. Migrated cells on the lower side of membranes were stained with Giemsa stain and enumerated under a microscope at × 200 magnification. Two random microscopic fields were counted per well, and all experiments were performed in duplicate. Cells were plated in six-well plates on FN-coated glass coverslips (Becton Dickinson Labware), washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS, permeabilized by treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and then blocked in PBS containing 0.2% gelatin and 0.02% NaN3. For actin organization, cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (5 μg/ml in PBS, Sigma). For immunofluorescence staining, cells were incubated with 1/50 diluted antibodies against vinculin and paxillin or 1/100 diluted anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies for 40 min at 20 °C in a humidified chamber. Coverslips were then treated with secondary antibodies at the recommended dilution and washed with PBS. For examination by fluorescent microscopy, slides were covered with 4′,6′-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride antifade, which stained the nuclei blue. Microscopic analysis of fluorescent in situhybridization images was done using an Aristoplan fluorescence microscope (Leitz, Rockleigh, NJ) equipped with appropriate filters and using 63× and 100× oil-immersion objectives. Image capturing was performed with a cooled charged-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AR) and a software package developed by Vysis, Inc. (Downers Grove, IL). Separate gray images of the three colors (red, green, and blue) were taken using individual fluorescein isothiocyanate, Texas Red, and 4′,6′-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride filters, transferred to a Macintosh computer, then pseudocolored and superimposed using a commercial software package by Vysis, Inc. to yield the final image. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (37Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifugated at 15,000 × gfor 10 min, and supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies at 4 °C for 2–4 h. Resulting immune complexes were incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 1–2 h. Beads were washed four times in 1 ml of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and membranes were blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) plus 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) or 5% non-fat milk (Bio-Rad). Blots were incubated first with primary antibodies for 1.5 h, washed three times in TBST buffer, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Proteins were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the c-Src SH2 domain was purified as described previously (38Feng G.S. Ouyang Y.B. Hu D.P. Shi Z.Q. Gentz R. Ni J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12129-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). GST-SrcSH2 fusion protein (5 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was mixed with cell lysates (1 mg of total protein) at 4 °C for 2 h and washed three times with the immunoprecipitation buffer. Protein complexes were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by immunoblotting as described above. A construct was engineered by inserting a 2.2-kilobase pair Shp-2 cDNA fragment into pcDNA3.1/hygro(+) vector (Invitrogen) at aBamHI site, for expression of a full-length wild-type Shp-2 protein. Subconfluent Shp-2−/− cells were exposed for 5 h to PerFectTMLipids (Invitrogen) containing 10 μg of the recombinant DNA construct or the vector in a 60-mm cell culture dish. Cells were first cultured in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h and then selected with hygromycin B (Sigma) at the dosage of 200 μg/ml. Hygromycin-resistant clones were isolated and screened for expression of wild-type Shp-2 protein by immunoblot analysis using anti-Shp-2 antibody. The establishment and growth properties of wild-type (Shp-2+/+), heterozygous (Shp-2+/−), and homozygous (Shp-2−/−) mutant fibroblast cell lines were described previously (34Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in our previous experiments (31Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 34Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5499-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), Shp-2+/− cells and animals have the wild-type phenotype, suggesting that the mutant Shp-2 protein without the intact SH2-N domain does not function in a dominant negative manner but rather is a loss-of-function molecule. It was first noticed in our routine cell passages that Shp-2−/− cells spread at a slower rate than Shp-2+/+ and Shp-2+/− cells after trypsinization and that the same phenotype was observed in at least five independently isolated Shp-2−/− cell lines. To carefully compare the spreading efficiency, we collected wild-type and mutant fibroblasts in serum-free DMEM and plated cells on FN-coated cell culture dishes. As depicted in Fig. 1 A, a striking difference in the appearance of cell spreading on FN was observed between wild-type and Shp-2−/− cells (Fig. 1). Wild-type cells initiated spreading within 10 min after plating, with approximately 50% of them attaining a flat morphology in 30 min, and at 60 min, nearly 90% of wild-type cells appeared well extended and had achieved a flattened morphology. In contrast, Shp-2−/− cells spread at a much reduced rate with only about 60% of the cells spreading well by 60 min. Similar results were observed when cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and plated either on FN-coated or uncoated tissue culture dishes (data not shown). Consistent with the defective cell spreading of Shp-2−/− fibroblasts is an alteration in cell morphology (Fig. 1). Wild-type cells appear more extended and elongated, whereas mutant cells do not spread or elongate extensively and look smaller. However, flow cytometry analysis indicated that there was no difference of cell sizes between wild-type and Shp-2 mutant cellls (data not shown), suggesting that the Shp-2 mutation affects cell spreading but not cell size. Using the modified chamber for cell mobility assay, we compared the migration of wild-type and Shp-2−/− cells. Fibroblasts were seeded in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate into the lower chamber through the small pores of a membrane (8 μm). Migrated cells were enumerated after 3, 6, and 9 h. Compared with wild-type cells, the ability of Shp-2−/− cells to migrate on FN was significantly reduced (Fig.2 A). The experiments have been repeated with several other wild-type and mutant fibroblast cell lines, and consistent results have been obtained (data not shown). To further explore the effect of the Shp-2 mutation on cell motility, we also compared wild-type and Shp-2−/− embryonic stem (ES) cells for their migration capacity. These Shp-2−/− ES cell lines were independently isolated by selection of Shp-2+/− ES cells in a high dosage of G418 as described previously (39Qu C.K. Shi Z.Q. Shen R. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5499-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). One wild-type and two Shp-2−/− ES cell lines were assessed for migration on FN. As shown in Fig. 2 B, mutant ES cells exhibited significantly slower migration rate than wild-type ES cells. Therefore, reduced cell motility was observed in both totipotent stem cells and fibroblasts of Shp-2−/− origin. We have shown previously in the in vitroES cell differentiation assay that Shp-2 mutant ES cells exhibited an impaired capacity to develop into embryoid bodies that contain various tissue-specific cells, including hematopoietic and cardiac muscle cells (39Qu C.K. Shi Z.Q. Shen R. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5499-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 40Qu C.K. Feng G.S. Oncogene. 1998; 15 (in press)Google Scholar). Decreased cell motility may account, at least in part, for differentiation problems of Shp-2−/− ES cells in vitro and embryos in vivo. The data shown above indicate that Shp-2−/− cells have reduced capacity to spread and migrate on FN, which could result from a defect in cell adhesion on FN. To test this hypothesis, we examined wild-type and mutant cells in their adhesion to FN. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates previously coated with FN and incubated for 10, 20, 30, and 60 min. After removal of nonadherent cells by washing with PBS, attached cells were stained with crystal violet andA595 was measured. The results are shown in Fig.3. No significant differences between Shp-2+/+, -+/−, and -−/− cells were observed in their adhesion to FN. This result argues that reduced spreading and migration of Shp-2−/− cells was not due to an inability of the cells to adhere to FN. Consistent with this observation, similar levels of integrin α5 and β1 expression were detected on Shp-2+/+, Shp-2+/−, and Shp-2−/− fibroblast cells by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4). Integrins α5 and β1 are the major isoforms of integrins expressed on the surface of fibroblasts that are responsible for cell adhesion on FN. Therefore, the Shp-2 mutation did not cause any changes in the expression of integrins and cell adhesion behavior. It seems more likely that Shp-2 modulates integrin-mediated intracellular signaling pathways for cytoskeletal organization and control of cell spreading and migration. Cells plated on FN were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for examination of filamentous actin (F-actin). In comparison with wild-type cells (Fig. 5, a andb), Shp-2−/− cells (Fig. 5, c and d) displayed an increased density of F-actin staining and numerous microspikes at the cell periphery, hallmarks of the early stage of nonpolar cell spreading. To characterize the formation of focal adhesions, cells plated on FN were stained with antibodies against vinculin or paxillin. There was a much higher number of focal adhesion contacts in Shp-2−/− cells than in wild-type cells as revealed by vinculin staining (Fig. 5, f and i). Furthermore, vinculin-positive patches were scattered across the ventral surface in Shp-2−/− cells, in contrast to the typical focal adhesion patches at the cell periphery in wild-type cells. The distribution of paxillin was similar to the arrangement of F-actin fibers, which was condensed around cell perimeters in mutant cells as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 5, e and h). As revealed by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody staining (Fig. 5, g andj), more abundant tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins distributed in numerous podosome-like focal adhesion sites were detected in Shp-2−/− cells than in wild-type cells, correlating well with the observed enhanced formation of focal adhesion in mutant cells. Previous experiments suggested that Src is physically associated with and phosphorylates several proteins, including FAK and paxillin, in focal adhesions (41Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 43Vuori K.

Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The Src SH2 domain is responsible for mediating the protein-protein interaction. To understand the biochemical basis for the alteration of focal adhesion in Shp-2 mutant cells, we examined the physical association of FAK and paxillin with Src SH2 domain in vitro. Purified GST-SrcSH2 fusion protein was incubated with cell lysates, and the bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6, the immobilized GST-SrcSH2 fusion protein precipitated FAK, paxillin, and Shp-2. Interestingly, FAK and paxillin were associated with SrcSH2 in wild-type and Shp-2+/− cells only when they were attached to ECM. These proteins were not precipitable by SrcSH2 in cells kept in suspension for 2 h, but reassociation was detected after replating cells on FN for 20 and 40 min. These results suggest that the physical interaction between these proteins is regulated during cell attachment and detachment. However, this regulation was apparently disrupted in Shp-2−/− cells; FAK and paxillin were precipitated by the SrcSH2 fusion protein in mutant cells even in suspension. Interestingly, both the wild-type and mutant Shp-2 proteins were detected in the SrcSH2 precipitates either in suspension or attachment. Thus, it is evident that a functional Shp-2 with intact SH2 domains might be required for its physiological activity in cells. To determine whether Shp-2 had a functional role in focal adhesion, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation levels of FAK in wild-type, Shp-2+/−, and Shp-2−/− cells under various conditions. Fibroblast cells were trypsinized and kept in suspension in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% trypsin inhibitor for 0, 5, 15, and 45 min at 37 °C. Cell suspensions were then left on ice for 10 min, and cell lysates were made. FAK was specifically precipitated with anti-FAK antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-PY antibody. As shown in Fig.7, rapid FAK dephosphorylation was observed in wild-type and Shp-2+/− cells when they were kept in suspension. In contrast, decrease in the phosphorylation level of FAK was slowed down in Shp-2−/− cells when kept in suspension. The same filter of FAK immunoprecipitates was striped and reblotted with anti-Shp-2 antibody. Indeed, Shp-2 was coprecipitated with FAK in fibroblast cells either in attachment or in suspension. This represents the first biochemical evidence for the physical involvement of Shp-2 in mediating the regulation of focal adhesion and FAK activity. The results described above point to a putative function of Shp-2 in the control of cell mobility by working in concert with FAK. A targeted mutation in the Shp-2 locus severely decreased cell migration in homozygous mutant cells, a phenotype similar to FAK−/− cells. Because a truncated Shp-2 protein with a deletion of 65 amino acids in the SH2-N domain was expressed, one might argue that the abnormal phenotype could be due to an aberrant activity of the mutant molecule. To rule out that possibility, we transfected the wild-type Shp-2 cDNA into Shp-2−/− fibroblast cells. Several clones expressing different levels of wild-type Shp-2 were isolated, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis using anti-Shp-2 antibody. Cell migration over FN was then assayed in the same way as in Fig. 2. Upon reintroduction of wild-type Shp-2 protein, an enhanced cell motility on FN was observed, and more importantly, the increased rate in cell migration was proportional to the expression levels of wild-type Shp-2 in mutant cells (Fig. 8). These results establish an important role of Shp-2 in the stimulation of cell motility. In the present study, we have shown that Shp-2, an ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase with two SH2 domains at the NH2 terminus, participates in integrin-initiated signaling events. Fibroblast cells in which a functional Shp-2 molecule is absent displayed significantly reduced ability to spread over FN. Impaired cell migration on FN was observed in Shp-2 mutant fibroblasts as well as totipotent ES cells. The defect in cell mobility was rescued by re-introduction of wild-type Shp-2 protein into Shp-2-deficient fibroblast cells. These results indicate that Shp-2 tyrosine phosphatase functions to promote cell migration. It is interesting to note that the expression of integrins α5 and β1 on cell surface was not changed, and cell adhesion to FN was not altered by the Shp-2 mutation. Therefore, the defect in cell spreading and migration might be due to an alteration in cytoskeletal organization in Shp-2 mutant cells. Indeed, we observed that Shp-2−/− cells displayed an increased number of focal adhesion and condensed F-actin staining at the cell periphery. This phenotype is quite similar to FAK-deficient cells, and it would suggest that Shp-2 might work in concert with FAK in the control of dynamics of focal adhesions. Support to this hypothesis came from our observations described in Figs. 6 and 7. FAK underwent a regulated association with Src SH2 domain during cell attachment and detachment, which was apparently correlated with its tyrosine-phosphorylation status. FAK was highly phosphorylated on tyrosine when cells attached to ECM and became rapidly dephosphorylated upon detachment. In Shp-2 mutant cells, both FAK dephosphorylation and its dynamic interaction with Src SH2 domain were significantly reduced. Therefore, Shp-2 might be involved in the deactivation of FAK, which is required for the regeneration of active FAK in the turnover of focal adhesion during cell migration. A typical cell movement across a two-dimensional substrate could be divided into three concerted steps, membrane protrusion, cell traction, deadhesion and tail retraction. Adhesion at the leading edge and deadhesion at the rear portion of cells are required for protrusion and tail retraction, respectively (45Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). The dynamic turnover of focal adhesions is likely to play a critical role in cell spreading and migration over ECM. Condensed distribution of focal adhesion sites at the edge of FAK−/− and Shp-2 mutant fibroblasts might reflect a defect in their turnover, which leads to a reduction in cell motility. These results would allow us to raise an intriguing proposal regarding the dynamic interplay between a PTK and a PTP in the control of cell mobility and focal adhesion. Shp-2 might be involved in the turnover of focal adhesions by mediating the dephosphorylation of several proteins, including FAK and paxillin, which influences cell spreading, migration, and cytoskeletal architecture. Although the biochemical mechanism for the specific function of Shp-2 in focal adhesion is to be defined, our results indicate that an intact SH2-N domain is required for Shp-2 activity. Notably, Kaplan et al. (35Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) reported that the function of c-Src in promoting cell spreading requires its SH2 and SH3 domain but not the kinase catalytic activity. Experiments are in progress to determine whether Shp-2 can affect cell motility by a phosphatase-independent mechanism. We have reported previously that homozygous Shp-2 mutant mice died at midgestation with multiple developmental defects in mesodermal structures (31Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The development of axial structures, node, notochord, and the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis, was severely perturbed in homozygous mutant embryos. Shp-2 mutant embryos exhibited variable degrees of posterior truncations apparently associated with the abnormal development of the node/tail bud and the notochord (31Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Shp-2 might be involved in mediating the proper organization and migration of mesodermal cells during gastrulation. The abnormal phenotype of Shp-2 mutant mice is consistent with a dominant negative study in Xenopus embryos (47Tang T.L. Freeman Jr., R. O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Sokol S.Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Injection of a catalytically inactive mutant Shp-2 molecule caused defects in mesodermal induction, particularly the truncation of terminal structures. Shp-2 mutant embryos share several abnormal features in the axial mesodermal tissues with FAK−/− and FN-deficient embryos, which died at the same stage of gastrulation (32Furuta Y. Ilic D. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1989-1995PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, targeted mutations in the FGF-R1, csk, andGAP/Nf1 (double mutant) loci also gave rise to a similar phenotype in mesodermal patterning in homozygous mutant animals (46Yamaguchi T.P. Harpal K. Henkemeyer M. Rossant J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 3032-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar,48Henkemeyer M. Rossi D.J. Holmyard D.P. Puri M.C. Mbamalu G. Harpal K. Shih T.S. Jacks T.

These results would suggest an integration of signals in the control of cell growth, movement, and differentiation during mammalian development. The past 5 years have witnessed a rapid progress in our understanding of SH2-containing PTPs in cell regulation. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that Shp-1 and Shp-2 are important players in cell proliferation and differentiation, in a negative or a positive manner. We and others have shown that Shp-2 apparently plays a positive role in mediating mitogenic stimulation of extracellular-signal regulated kinases (29Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y.

This report establishes that Shp-2 operates in signal relay downstream of integrins in guiding cell migration. Therefore, Shp-2 appears to participate in transmission and/or integration of signals emanating from receptors for cytokines and ECM. We thank Drs. Mark Kaplan, Ron Wek, and Peter Roach for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2053100392,"Previously we showed that activation of Erk in quiescent cells occurs in the caveolae fraction isolated from fibroblasts. Since the structure and function of caveolae is sensitive to the amount of cholesterol in the membrane, it might be that a direct link exists between the concentration of membrane cholesterol and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. We acutely lowered the cholesterol level of the caveolae fraction by incubating Rat-1 cells in the presence of either cyclodextrin or progesterone. Cholesterol-depleted caveolae had a reduced amount of several key protein components of the MAP kinase complex, including Ras, Grb2, Erk2, and Src. Incubation of these cells in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) caused a rapid loss of EGF receptor from the caveolae fraction, but the usual recruitment of c-Raf was markedly inhibited. Despite the reduced amount of c-Raf and Erk2 in the cholesterol-depleted caveolae fraction, EGF caused a hyperactivation of the remaining caveolae Erk isoenzymes. This was followed by an increase in the amount of active Erk in the cytoplasm. The increased amount of activated Erk produced under these conditions was linked to a 2-fold higher level of EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. Even cholesterol depletion by itself stimulated Erk activation and DNA synthesis.

Cholesterol is an important structural lipid that modulates the fluidity of biological membranes. Several new studies also indicate that membrane cholesterol has a direct role in cell signaling.

The release of the mature SREBP from the ER is regulated by SCAP, a protein containing up to 8 membrane-spanning regions. One of the transmembrane domains of SCAP appears to sense the level of cholesterol in the membrane and regulate the proteolytic cleavage of SREBP when cellular cholesterol gets low. Similar cholesterol “sensing” domains are present in the NPC1 (2Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J. Krizman D.B. Nagle J.

Another protein that interacts with cholesterol is caveolin-1 (6Murata M. Peränen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Caveolin-1 appears to have a major function in carrying cholesterol between ER and caveolae membranes (9Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). This is accomplished using a novel membrane traffic route that shuttles caveolin-1 back and forth between the two compartments (10Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Ordinarily the cholesterol-to-protein ratio of the caveolae fraction is 4–5 times higher than the surrounding plasma membrane (10Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

Experimentally lowering the cholesterol level of the caveolae fraction disrupts the molecular organization of the domain (11Chang W.-J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J.

Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). In addition to being a portal of entry into the cell, caveolae are the surface locations where multiple signaling pathways converge (9Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar, 14Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). One of the pathways organized at this site links multiple receptor tyrosine kinases to MAP kinases (15Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

Interactions between as many as 11 different molecules can take place during activation of a MAP kinase, and representatives of each are present in the caveolae fraction of quiescent cells (17Liu P. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These molecules apparently are functionally linked to MAP kinase because incubation of fibroblasts in the presence of growth factors activates the Erk in the caveolae fraction, which is followed by the appearance of the active enzyme in the cytoplasm (17Liu P. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Incubation of isolated caveolae fractions in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor also activates the resident Erk enzymes (17Liu P. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The molecular machinery responsible for holding these molecules so they can optimally interact during signal transduction is not known. Based on what is known about caveolae membrane structure (9Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), however, cholesterol could be an important determinant in organizing the MAP kinase complex. We now report that depletion of cholesterol from the caveolae fraction results in a decline in several key proteins of the MAP kinase complex, an increase in the sensitivity of the resident Erk enzymes to stimulation, and an increase in mitogenesis.

The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (1 ml) was then added to the well for 30 min to precipitate the DNA and remove all soluble isotope. Finally, the precipitate was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, mixed with 10 ml of scintillation fluid, and counted in a Beckman LS 6000SC. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Cholesterol was measured according to the method of Gamble et al. (21Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used Rat-1 cells and EGF to study the effects of cholesterol depletion on MAP kinase activation. These cells synthesize very little cholesterol after growing for 24–48 h in the absence of serum (data not shown). Cholesterol was specifically (22Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) removed from the plasma membrane (∼65% decrease) by incubating the cells in the presence of 2% cyclodextrin (2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) for 1 h at 37 °C. The membrane cholesterol levels returned to near normal when the cells were subsequently incubated in the presence of a cholesterol (16 μg/ml)-cyclodextrin (0.4%) complex for 1 h. No change occurred, however, if the complex was omitted from the incubation media. We used detergent-free membrane fractionation (18Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) to determine how cyclodextrin affected the cholesterol level of caveolae fractions compared with other fractions of the plasma membrane (Fig.1). The first gradient used in this procedure separates low density plasma membranes rich in caveolae from bulk membrane protein. The majority of the protein (66%) was in fractions 8–14, and the protein profile did not change after cyclodextrin treatment (compare ■ with ○, C). The top seven fractions were pooled and used to enrich for caveolae on a second gradient (CV fraction, 2.6% of membrane protein) while fractions 8 and 9 (intermediate fractions) and 10–14 (heavy fractions) where pooled and analyzed directly. The cholesterol-to-protein ratio in the caveolae fraction declined by 68% in response to cyclodextrin treatment (A, compare lanes 1 and 2). The ratio remained low after the cells were incubated further for 1 h in the absence of cyclodextrin (A, lane 3) but returned to near normal after the addition of cholesterol-CD complex to the media (A, lane 4). By contrast, cyclodextrin had much less effect on the specific cholesterol content of intermediate (lanes 5–8) and heavy (lanes 9–12) fractions. Since we did not detect any change in the concentration of other major lipids in these fractions (including phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin (data not shown)), cyclodextrin can be used to both remove and restore membrane cholesterol without causing major changes to other lipids in the bilayer. Cyclodextrin also caused a reversible decrease in the amount of caveolin-1 in the caveolae fraction (Fig. 1 B,CV). Samples of caveolae (lanes 1–4, 5 μg/lane), intermediate (lanes 5–8, 10 μg/lane), and heavy (lanes 9–12, 10 μg/lane) fractions from cells subjected to various treatments were separated and blotted with anti-caveolin-1 IgG. As expected, caveolin-1 was highly enriched in the caveolae fraction from control cells (lane 1). Some caveolin-1 was also detected in the intermediate fractions (lane 5) but none was present in the heavy fractions (lane 9). The amount of caveolin-1 in the caveolae fractions significantly declined after cyclodextrin treatment (compare lanes 2 and 1). Cyclodextrin also caused a modest increase in the amount of caveolin-1 in the intermediate fractions (compare lanes 5and 6). Caveolin-1 levels in the caveolae fraction declined further (lane 3) when the cells were incubated an additional hour in the absence of cyclodextrin. Caveolin-1 in the intermediate fraction (lane 7) also decreased under these conditions but the total amount of caveolin-1 in the cell remained constant (data not shown). Once cholesterol was restored to the membranes by incubating cells in the presence of the cholesterol-CD complex (lanes 4, 8, and12), the concentration of caveolin-1 in the various fractions returned to nearly the same level as in control cells. The total protein recovered in the caveolae fraction was not altered by any of these treatments (Fig. 1 C), and the total caveolin-1 in the cell remained constant (data not shown). Therefore, lowering the cholesterol level in the caveolae fraction results in a redistribution of caveolin-1. Previously we showed that the major protein components of the MAP kinase complex are concentrated in the caveolae fractions isolated from quiescent cells (17Liu P. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We used immunoblotting to determine whether cholesterol depletion had any effect on the concentration of these proteins (Fig. 2). Equal amounts of protein (5 μg/lane) from cholesterol-depleted (lane 2) and non-depleted (lane 1) caveolae fractions were separated by gel electrophoresis and blotted with specific antibodies. As we have shown in other studies (15Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 16Liu P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), caveolae fractions from control cells were enriched in caveolin-1 (Cav), EGF receptors (A, EGF-R), all three isoforms of Shc (A, Shc), Grb2 (A, Grb2), both Gαi (A,Gα) and Gβ (B,Gβ) heterotrimeric proteins, both Ki- and Ha-Ras (A, K-Ras, H-Ras), and Src (B, Src). In cholesterol-depleted caveolae, by contrast, the amount of caveolin-1, Grb2, Ras, and Src was markedly reduced. Shc isoforms and Gβ were decreased to a lesser extent. EGF receptors and Gαi were unchanged, suggesting that cholesterol depletion does not alter the entire protein composition of caveolae. The concentration of each of the depleted proteins increased after cells were incubated in the presence of the cholesterol-CD complex (lane 4), but not if the cells were incubated in media alone (lane 3). Within minutes after Rat-1 cells are exposed to EGF, c-Raf is recruited to caveolae fractions (15Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We looked at the effect of cholesterol depletion on the EGF-stimulated movement of c-Raf and six other protein components of the MAP kinase complex including Erk2 (Fig.3). Untreated (CD−) and cyclodextrin-treated (CD+) cells were incubated in the presence of EGF for 0, 1, and 3 min before caveolae fractions were prepared and processed for immunoblotting. Cholesterol depletion markedly suppressed the appearance of c-Raf in the caveolae fraction (compare c-Raf lanes 1–3 with 4–6). It also suppressed the appearance of SOS and Shc (comparelanes 1–3 with 4–6). Proteins that ordinarily do not change in response to EGF (Erk2, Gαi, Grb2, and Ras) remained constant. The basal level of Erk2, however, was much lower in cholesterol-depleted caveolae fractions (lanes 4–6). The concentration of Ras, Grb2, and Shc was also lower. Therefore, cholesterol depletion had a profound effect on the molecular composition of the MAP kinase complex in caveolae fractions. We used an antibody that recognizes activated Erk1 and -2 to determine how the cholesterol depletion of the caveolae fraction affected the ability of EGF to activate these enzymes (Fig.4). Two different incubation sequences were used to look at early (0, 1, 3 min, lanes 1–6) and late (0, 5, 10 min, lanes 7–12) effects of EGF. Cells were preincubated in the presence (CD+) or absence (CD−) of cyclodextrin before the addition of EGF, and both the caveolae (Cav) and cytoplasmic (Cyt) fractions were analyzed. The EGF receptor (EGF-R) moved out of the cholesterol-depleted caveolae fraction with the same rapid kinetics as it does from untreated caveolae fractions (Cav, compare lanes 1–3 with4–6). Cholesterol depletion also suppressed c-Raf (c-Raf) recruitment and decreased the level of Erk2 (Erk2) without affecting the Gαi(Gα) concentration (Cav, compare lanes 1–3 with 4–6 and 9–11 with12–14). By contrast, cholesterol depletion caused a marked increase in the amount of activated Erk (phoMAPK) in the caveolae fraction Cav, compare lanes 3 with6 and 9–11 with 12–14). Even cyclodextrin alone caused a significant increase in activated Erk (Cav, compare lanes 1 with 4 and9 with 12). Usually the appearance of activated Erk in the cytoplasm lags a little behind the caveolae fraction (17Liu P. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), but after 5 or 10 min in the presence of EGF we saw a similar dramatic increase in the amount of active enzyme in the cytoplasmic fraction of cholesterol-depleted cells (Cyt, comparelanes 9–11 with 12–14. The cytoplasmic concentrations of c-Raf and Erk2 were unaffected by cholesterol depletion. The effect of cyclodextrin on Erk activation was blunted by cholesterol (Fig. 5). Cells were incubated in the presence (Chol/CD+) or absence (Chol/CD−) of cholesterol-CD complex for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of EGF for 0, 1, and 3 min (lanes 1–6). Cyclodextrin plus cholesterol had little effect on c-Raf recruitment relative to control treatments (compare lanes 1–3 with 4–6). Moreover, EGF-stimulated Erk activation (phoMAPK) was only slightly elevated compared with untreated cells. These results suggest that it is the decrease in caveolae cholesterol, not the presence of cyclodextrin, that is responsible for the increase in activated Erk. The caveolae fraction can also be depleted of cholesterol by incubating the cells in the presence of progesterone. A 1-h incubation in the presence of 10 μg/ml progesterone reduced the specific cholesterol content of the caveolae fraction from 0.7 to 0.45 mg/mg of protein. Although this amount of loss was ∼50% less than what occurred with cyclodextrin, progesterone specifically affected the cholesterol level of caveolae. There was virtually no decrease in the specific cholesterol content of non-caveolae membrane fractions (data not shown). Progesterone-treated (+, lanes 4–6) and non-treated (−, lanes 1–3) cells were incubated in the presence of EGF for 0, 5, and 10 min (Fig. 6). Similar to cyclodextrin, progesterone suppressed EGF-stimulated c-Raf recruitment (Cav, c-Raf), reduced the level of Erk2 in the caveolae fraction (Cav, Erk2), but had little effect on the level of EGF receptors. In addition, the amount of both basal and EGF-stimulated activated Erk (phoMAPK) in the caveolae fraction was markedly increased in progesterone-treated cells (Cav, compare lanes 1–3 with4–6). The cytoplasmic level of activated kinase was also increased by progesterone (Cyt, compare lanes 1–3 with 4–6). Therefore, two different methods of lowering the cholesterol level of the caveolae fraction render the resident MAP kinase hyper-responsive to EGF. Since EGF acts through the MAP kinase pathway to stimulate mitogenesis, we used [3H]thymidine incorporation to determine whether cyclodextrin had any effect on DNA synthesis (Fig.7). Cells were incubated in the presence of various concentrations of cyclodextrin for 1 h. The cells were further incubated for 24 h in the presence (•) or absence (○) of EGF (A) before measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. In the absence of EGF, increasing the concentration of cyclodextrin in the media caused an increase in mitogenesis, which is consistent with its ability to activate Erk. Stimulation plateaued at 1.5% cyclodextrin. EGF alone also stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation, but cyclodextrin increased the level of DNA synthesis further. Cyclodextrin plus EGF caused a 3-fold higher level of DNA synthesis than no treatment. The synergistic effects of cyclodextrin and EGF were blocked by cholesterol (B). In the absence of cholesterol, EGF and cyclodextrin together caused a 2.5-fold stimulation in mitogenesis. As the concentration of cholesterol was increased, however, thymidine incorporation progressively declined (•). Two experimental conditions that acutely lower the cholesterol level of the caveolae fraction cause a resident population of MAP kinase to become hyper-responsive to EGF. While cyclodextrin caused a general cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane, progesterone removed cholesterol specifically from the caveolae fraction. The effects of cholesterol depletion on caveolae MAP kinase activity were blunted by incubating the cells in the presence of cyclodextrin plus cholesterol. These results suggest that the caveolae MAP kinase signaling pathway is influenced by how much cholesterol is in the membrane. Cholesterol depletion caused a disruption in the molecular organization of the MAP kinase signaling complex. Lowering the cholesterol caused a decline in many of the key molecules in the complex, including Erk2. It also blocked EGF-stimulated c-Raf recruitment to caveolae, as well as the recruitment of other molecules in the complex. This loss of organization might have two potential effects. 1) It uncoupled a feedback loop between EGF receptors and Erk2, leading to the generation of higher than normal amounts of activated Erk2 per bound EGF. 2) The decreased concentration of Erk in caveolae caused a hyperphosphorylation of the enzyme by MEK (25Burack W.R. Sturgill T.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5929-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase activated under these circumstances could stimulate DNA synthesis nearly 2-fold above EGF alone. Even cholesterol depletion by itself activated Erk and stimulated DNA synthesis. Therefore, a direct connection exists between the downstream signaling activities of Erk and the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane. Biophysical studies (26Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 27Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 28Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) suggest caveolae membrane lipids are in a liquid-order phase (referred to as the β phase) because of a high concentration of glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. The β phase has characteristic physical properties, such as resistance to solubilization by Triton X-100 (28Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and a relatively low lateral mobility of resident lipids (26Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). This special lipid environment appears to be important for attracting and organizing lipid-anchored proteins (glycosylphosphatidylinositol, acyl, and prenyl anchors) in caveolae. Since cholesterol is a critical ingredient for the β phase transition (28Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), decreasing the cholesterol content of caveolae can directly affect the number and organization of lipid-anchored proteins as a result of changing the phase properties of the bilayer (11Chang W.-J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 29Smart E.J. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Any protein that interacts with lipid-anchored proteins in caveolae will be similarly affected. Therefore, the loss of components from the MAP kinase complex following cholesterol depletion as well as the hyper-responsive Erk can be traced to a stringent requirement for high cholesterol to maintain the proper organization of caveolae membranes. The maintenance of high cholesterol levels in caveolae is an active process. Newly synthesized cholesterol transported directly from the ER to the plasma membrane (30Liscum L. Underwood K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15443-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) initially appears in the caveolae membrane (10Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 may be necessary for caveolae to have high cholesterol levels (10Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), which suggests it is a component of the ER-to-caveolae shuttle. Moreover, caveolin-1 moves from caveolae through the ER to the Golgi apparatus when caveolae cholesterol becomes oxidized (31Smart E.J. Ying Y.-U. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Caveolae can also acquire cholesterol released from low density lipoproteins in lysosomes (32Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14932-14938Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the high density lipoprotein-binding protein SR-B1, which binds both normal and damaged lipoproteins (33Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar), has been localized to caveolae (34Babitt J. Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Xu S. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) where it may facilitate the bidirectional transfer of cholesterol between lipoproteins and caveolae. The convergence of both cholesterol import and export at caveolae provides the cell with redundant mechanisms for delivering cholesterol to this membrane domain. Several pathological conditions exist where the concentration of cholesterol in caveolae might influence the transduction of mitogenic signals. Caveolae cholesterol levels could either be too high or too low. Overaccumulation of cellular cholesterol is common in cells within atherosclerotic lesions. No one has studied the MAP kinase activity in caveolae of cholesterol-enriched cells, but our results predict the enzyme would be hyporesponsive to growth factors such as EGF. Recently, Pomerantz et al. (35Pomerantz K.B. Lander H.M. Summers B. Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E. Hajjar D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9523-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that cultured smooth muscle cells with elevated levels of cholesterol exhibit a reduced MAP kinase activity in response to platelet-derived growth factor. At the other extreme, transformed cells have below normal amounts of caveolae cholesterol, which is restored to normal after the cells are transfected with caveolin-1 (10Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Loss of caveolin-1 often occurs in cells infected with oncogenic viruses (36Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and expression of caveolin-1 in transformed cells can revert the cell to a normal phenotype (37Engelman J.A. Wykoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This suggests caveolin-1 acts as a tumor suppresser (38Couet J. Li S.W. Okamoto T. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since the hyper-responsive MAP kinase in cholesterol-depleted caveolae is mitogenic (Fig. 7), the tumor-suppressing effect of caveolin-1 may be due to its ability to return the concentration of cholesterol in caveolae to normal. The ability of cholesterol to directly influence an entire signal pathway suggests that the concentration of cholesterol in each membrane compartment within the cell must be tightly controlled. Otherwise signals originating from sources such as the EGF receptor would be unreliable. Therefore, in addition to balancing endogenous and exogenous sources of cholesterol (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar), cells must regulate the supply of cholesterol to specific membrane compartments such as caveolae. This level of regulation should involve at least two components: a sensing device that detects how much cholesterol is present in the membrane of the compartment and a transporter that responds to the cholesterol sensor by delivering or removing cholesterol. Caveolin-1 is a candidate component of the transporter that supplies cholesterol for the caveolae compartment. So far no one has identified a protein in caveolae that contains a transmembrane domain homologous to those thought to be involved in detecting membrane cholesterol (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar).

Mammalian cells can repair abasic sites, an intermediate of BER, using at least two distinct pathways: one involving single nucleotide gap filling by DNA polymerase β (“simple” BER) and an “alternate” pathway that involves proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In this latter pathway gap-filling DNA synthesis appears to be catalyzed by DNA polymerase δ or ε and results in a repair patch of 2–6 nucleotides (9Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F.

In addition, Klungland and Lindahl (10Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) have described a BER pathway that repairs reduced AP sites. This pathway also generates a repair patch 2–6 nucleotides in length, but in this case gap-filling DNA synthesis could be performed by DNA polymerase β (β-pol) or δ. Like the pathway described above (9Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspagilo G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), this BER pathway was stimulated by PCNA (10Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). A working model for the simple BER pathway is outlined as follows (for review see Refs. 11Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A.

The glycosidic bond linking the damaged base and deoxyribose is cleaved either spontaneously or by a DNA glycosylase activity removing the inappropriate base to generate an abasic or AP site in double-stranded DNA. The phosphodiester backbone of the AP site is cleaved 5′ to the sugar moiety by AP endonuclease, leaving a 3′-hydroxyl group and a deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) group at the 5′ terminus. Excision of the deoxyribose phosphate group is catalyzed by 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase, an activity that is intrinsic to the amino-terminal 8-kDa domain of β-pol. The β-pol dRP lyase activity functions via β-elimination (13Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and produces a single-nucleotide gap with a 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphate at the gap margins. DNA polymerase β then fills the single-nucleotide gap, and a DNA ligase seals the resulting nick. The identity of the DNA ligase that completes the simple BER pathway in mammalian cells is unresolved. There is genetic and biochemical evidence implicating the products of both the LIG1 andLIG3 genes in BER. Cell lines deficient in either DNA ligase I or DNA ligase III activity are hypersensitive to DNA alkylating agents (14Teo I.A. Arlett C.F. Harcourt S.A. Priestley A. Broughton B.C. Mutat.

Furthermore, protein-protein interactions between β-pol and XRCC1, the protein partner of DNA ligase III, and between β-pol and DNA ligase I have been characterized (7Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A.

Recently, we described the partial purification of a BER-proficient multiprotein complex from bovine testis nuclear extracts (19Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase β and DNA ligase I were identified as components of this complex, but no other ligases were present. Further studies have determined the stoichiometry and thermodynamic properties of this interaction and revealed that stable complex formation between DNA ligase I and β-pol is mediated through the noncatalytic amino-terminal domain of DNA ligase I and the 8-kDa amino-terminal domain of β-pol (20Dimitriadis E.K. Prasad R. Vaske M.K. Chen L. Tomkinson A. Lewis M.S. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Together, these results support the notion that a complex of β-pol and DNA ligase I catalyzes the latter steps of simple BER. To define the influence of this and other putative protein-protein interactions on catalytic activities of enzymes that participate in simple BER, we reconstituted BER of a DNA substrate containing an AP site with three purified human enzymes: AP endonuclease, DNA polymerase β, and DNA ligase I. By characterizing isolated, individual reactions within the BER pathway, we determined the rate-limiting step. Because the overall repair of the AP site occurred at a rate similar to that of dRP removal (dRP lyase step), we suggest that β-pol dRP lyase activity could determine the choice between the simple and alternate BER pathways. [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ddATP (specific activity, 6.6 × 106 dpm/pmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. High performance liquid chromatography-purified synthetic 51-base oligodeoxyribonucleotides that when annealed created a G-U base pair at position 22 were obtained from Oligos Etc, Inc.

The DNA substrate for the dRP lyase functional assay was a 49-base pair (bp) fragment constructed by annealing two oligodeoxyribonucleotides (Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda, CA) to introduce a G-U base pair at position 21: 5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAAUTAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT-3′ and 3′-TCGATGGTACGGACGTGCTTGATTCGTTAAGCATTAGTACCAGTATCGA-5′. The uracil-containing strand was labeled at the 3′-end for the dRP lyase assay as described (21Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Lyophilized oligodeoxyribonucleotides were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mmEDTA, and the concentrations were determined from their UV absorbance at 260 nm. Complimentary oligodeoxyribonucleotide or template primers were annealed by heating a solution of 10 μm template with an equivalent concentration of oligomers and primer to 90 °C for 3 min and incubating the solution for an additional 15 min at 50–60 °C, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Human recombinant β-pol was overexpressed from plasmid pWL-11 and purified as described (22Kumar A. Widen S.G. Williams K.R. Kedar P. Karpel R.L. Wilson S.H J. Biol.

An amino-terminal 84-residue deletion mutant of uracil DNA-glycosylase (UDG) that retains glycosylase activity was overexpressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity using the protocol described (25Slupphaug G.

Recombinant human DNA ligase I was overexpressed in baculovirus-infected cells and purified as described (26Wang Y.-C.J. Burkhart W.A. Mackey Z.B. Moyer M.B. Ramos W. Husain I. Chen J. Besterman J.M.

The simple base excision repair pathway was reconstituted using the recombinant human enzymes under the following conditions. The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 4 mm ATP, 1 μm 51-bp substrate with a uracil at position 22, and 0.3 μm[α-32P]dCTP. The enzyme mixture was assembled by mixing 10 nm each UDG, AP endonuclease, and β-pol with 100 nm DNA ligase I at 37 °C for 5 min. Bovine serum albumin replaced DNA ligase I or other constituent enzymes in the reactions that were assembled in the absence of an individual enzyme. The assembled enzyme mixture was incubated with DNA substrate at 37 °C for 30 min. To follow the reaction time course, the assembled reaction was incubated in the absence of MgCl2 for 5 min at 37 °C. During the incubation period, uracil is removed by UDG, creating an AP site. To initiate further repair, 5 mmMgCl2 (essential for AP endonuclease and β-pol) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C. After various periods, aliquots were removed, and the reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of gel loading buffer (40 mmEDTA, 80% formamide, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol). After 2 min at 95 °C, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mmboric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.8. The gel was dried, and the reaction products were visualized by autoradiography. The assay reactions described in Figs. 2 and 3 (25 μl) contained the same buffer as above. The rate of reconstituted BER was measured using a 51-bp DNA substrate (1 μm) that was first treated with UDG (10 nm) in the absence of MgCl2 for 5 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, 10 nm AP endonuclease, 10 nm β-pol, 100 nm DNA ligase I, 4 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm[α-32P]dCTP were added simultaneously, and aliquots were removed at the indicated times and quenched with 10 μl of 0.25 m EDTA. The samples were mixed with an equal volume of gel loading buffer, and the products were separated in 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gels. Individual bands were measured using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the concentrations of DNA present in the 51-mer product band was calculated from [α-32P]dCTP standards included in the gels. The ligase assay was performed in the same manner, except that after UDG treatment, the DNA was incubated for 10 min with AP endonuclease, β-pol, and [α-32P]dCTP. DNA ligase I (10 nm) and 4 mm ATP were simultaneously added, and aliquots were removed at various time intervals and quenched in EDTA, and the products were separated on denaturing gels. The DNA synthesis assays (β-pol) (see Fig. 2) were performed under the same conditions on a DNA substrate possessing a single-nucleotide gap in place of uracil in the 51-bp substrate. No other BER proteins were present in the assay. Quenched products were dried onto DEAE cellulose filters (DE-81, Whatman, Inc.), and the unincorporated [α-32P]dCTP was removed by rinsing the filters four times in 0.3 m ammonium formate, pH 8.0, and rinsing twice in 95% ethanol. Incorporated dCMP was quantified by scintillation counting. The DNA synthesis assay was repeated in Fig. 3, except that the substrate was the 51-residue uracil-containing substrate pretreated with UDG, AP endonuclease, and then ± β-pol (in the absence of dCTP). [α-32P]dCTP (10 μm) and DNA ligase I (100 nm) were then added simultaneously and quenched at various times, and the amount of DNA synthesis was measured using a portion of the reactions in the filter assay described above. Portions of the same reactions were then separated on a 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel, and the amount of the 51-residue product that incorporated [32P]dCMP was quantified.Figure 3Measurement of the DNA synthesis and dRP lyase velocities of β-pol on a BER intermediate substrate. The 51-nucleotide substrate containing a uracil at position 22 was treated with UDG and AP endonuclease to create a single base gap bearing a dRP moiety at the 5′-phosphate in the gap. A portion of this substrate was then treated with the dRP lyase activity of β-pol (in the absence of dCTP) to remove the deoxyribonucleotide phosphate group from the DNA. These enzymatic steps created the substrate intermediates present immediately before and after the dRP lyase activity of β-pol. A, DNA synthesis velocities on both substrates (dRP present (open circles) versus dRP group absent (closed circles)) were measured using the filter assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” The radioactivity present in the 22- and 51-nucleotide product bands was plotted on theordinate. The observed velocities were similar (4.0versus 3.9 nm s−1, respectively), indicating that the dRP moiety does not affect DNA synthesis by β-pol. B, the velocity of combined DNA synthesis, dRP lyase activity, and DNA ligase I activity was measured by loading the reactions used in A on a 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. The radioactivity present in the 51-nucleotide product bands was then measured by scintillation counting, and the product formed was plotted on the ordinate. For the substrate bearing the dRP group (open circles), the observed velocity was 0.8 nms−1, and for the substrate in which the dRP group was enzymatically removed (closed circles), the velocity was 2.7 nm s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dRP lyase and dRP lyase/DNA gap filling synthesis assay (see Fig.4) was performed under the following conditions. The standard reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 10 nm32P-labeled DNA, 10 nm each of UDG, AP endonuclease, and wild-type β-pol, or a K72A mutant of β-pol and 100 nm DNA ligase I. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 mm MgCl2 and 1.33 μm[α-32P]dCTP and incubated at 37 °C for 1, 5, or 10 min. The reactions were terminated with EDTA, and the product was stabilized by addition of NaBH4 to a final concentration of 340 mm and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C. The stabilized DNA product was recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml tRNA and resuspended in 10 μl of gel loading buffer. After incubation at 75 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The two substrates in our in vitro BER system were [α-32P]dCTP and a 51-bp duplex DNA with dUMP at position 22 in one strand (Fig.1 A). The labeled in vitro BER DNA products are the 51-residue molecule with [32P]dCMP at position 22 and/or the unligated 22-residue intermediate. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1 B, the BER system was reconstituted with four purified human enzymes (UDG, AP endonuclease, β-pol, and DNA ligase I). The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min, after which time the 51-residue product and a very small amount of the unligated 22-residue intermediate accumulated (lane 1). The ratio of 51-mer to 22-mer observed here was similar to that observed earlier with bovine tissue and mouse cell line nuclear extracts (5Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 27Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The enzyme and substrate requirements forin vitro BER were further investigated. UDG, AP endonuclease, β-pol, and DNA were each required for radiolabeled product formation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–4 and7). In the absence of DNA ligase I, accumulation of the unligated 22-residue intermediate was observed (lane 5). With all the enzymes present, the incorporation of [32P]dCMP into BER products was examined as a function of time (Fig. 1 C). The 22-mer intermediate accumulated modestly before being ligated to the downstream oligomer. To identify potential regulatory steps in BER, we compared time courses of the reconstituted reaction and the individual steps in the reaction pathway at 37 °C. These kinetic studies were performed at the enzyme concentrations described in Fig. 1 (10 nmeach UDG, AP endonuclease, and β-pol and 100 nm DNA ligase I) using saturating substrate concentrations (1 μmDNA, 10 μmdCTP, 4 mm ATP) to allow multiple catalytic turnovers. The decision to use a higher concentration of DNA ligase I than the other enzymes was based on preliminary results indicating that the unligated intermediate was accumulating during BER reactions performed using 10 nm DNA ligase I (data not shown). Because the persistence of this intermediate obscured study of enzymatic steps preceding the ligase step in this pathway (see below) and did not reflect results obtained with tissue nuclear extract (5Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), the higher DNA ligase I concentration was used throughout this work to facilitate study of the other steps. The time course of the reconstituted BER reaction revealed a slight lag phase preceding a linear steady-state rate (Fig.2 A). Extrapolation of the linear phase to the abscissa suggested a lag of approximately 5 s. These results are consistent with a model in which the concentration of an intermediate initially accumulates in the reaction mixture. After this lag, the overall base excision reaction proceeded at a velocity of 0.6 nm s−1 (Fig. 2 A). The fact that there was a lag and that the rate of the overall reaction after the lag was relatively slow suggested that an intermediate accumulates and limits the overall reaction. To delineate which BER activities were rate-determining for product formation, we compared the rates of the various enzymatic activities (Table I). Note that the velocity measured for the overall BER reaction was 0.6 nms−1. The first activity measured was the rate of DNA synthesis. With a single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate, we found that β-pol formed the 22-residue product at a reaction velocity of 4.5 nm s−1 (Fig. 2 B). Addition of DNA ligase I had a slight stimulatory effect on this DNA synthesis reaction rate (data not shown). Thus, the rate of the β-pol-mediated gap-filling reaction on a gapped DNA substrate was faster than the rate of the overall BER reaction and was not rate-limiting. The presence of a dRP group at the 5′ margin of the gap did not affect this rate (see Fig. 3 A).Table ISteady-state kinetic constants of human BER enzymesHuman enzymekcatKmkcat/KmVelocity under in vitro BER conditionsaRepair of an AP site-containing oligodeoxynucleotide.

Open table in a new tab The velocity of the DNA ligase I step under conditions of the reconstituted system was then measured and found to be 4 nms−1. Because the rate of ligation is faster than the rate of the reconstituted BER system (at high ligase concentration), one of the earlier intermediates must be accumulating during the BER reactionin vitro. Reducing the ligase concentration to 10 nm would result in a rate lower (0.4 nms−1) than the rate measured for the reconstituted BER reaction, confirming the observation noted above that DNA ligase I activity can limit the rate of BER when present at the lower concentration. From Table I, the rate of in vitro BER can be compared with the velocity of each of the purified enzymes under the conditions of the in vitro BER system. The results discussed above establish that DNA synthesis was not rate-limiting. As noted in TableI, AP endonuclease was also found to possess high catalytic efficiency and was not rate-limiting. Consistent with this suggestion, we found that preincision of the AP site containing DNA did not alter the velocity of overall BER (data not shown). Instead, the rate of 51-mer product formation for in vitro BER was almost identical to that of the β-pol dRP lyase activity (Table I). This suggests that the dRP lyase step is rate-limiting during in vitro BER and that the dRP-containing intermediate accumulates in the BER pathway. These data are paralleled bykcat/Km determinations (TableI) that identify the dRP lyase step as the least efficient. Significantly, these data also indicate that despite several potentially beneficial protein-protein interactions in the reconstituted BER system, the overall BER rate is not faster than the slowest individual enzymatic activity. The hypothesis that removal of the dRP moiety is the rate-determining step in the in vitro BER system was tested directly by measuring the velocity of polymerase-dependent nucleotide incorporation in the presence or absence of a dRP moiety. The presence or absence of the dRP group did not influence DNA synthesis by β-pol (velocity = 4 nm s−1, Fig.3 A). This was similar to the DNA synthesis velocity measured for β-pol in the absence of other BER proteins and was higher than the velocity of the dRP lyase itself (Table I). When a sample from the same reaction mixture was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, the rate of 51-mer product formation was found to be lower for the reaction in which the dRP group had not been enzymatically removed prior to DNA sy"
https://openalex.org/W2100420577,"We report the role of one member of a novel gene family, PACS-1, in the localization of trans-Golgi network (TGN) membrane proteins. PACS-1 directs the TGN localization of furin by binding to the protease’s phosphorylated cytosolic domain. Antisense studies show TGN localization of furin and mannose-6-phosphate receptor, but not TGN46, is strictly dependent on PACS-1. Analyses in vitro and in vivo show PACS-1 has properties of a coat protein and connects furin to components of the clathrin-sorting machinery. Cell-free assays indicate TGN localization of furin is directed by a PACS-1-mediated retrieval step. Together, these findings explain a mechanism by which membrane proteins in mammalian cells are localized to the TGN."

We have solved the CARD structure of the RAIDD adaptor protein that recruits ICH-1/caspase-2. It consists of six tightly packed helices arranged in a topology homologous to the Fas death domain. The surface contains a basic and an acidic patch on opposite sides. This polarity is conserved in the ICH-1 CARD as indicated by homology modeling. Mutagenesis data suggest that these patches mediate CARD/CARD interaction between RAIDD and ICH-1. Subsequent modeling of the CARDs of Apaf-1 and caspase-9, as well as Ced-4 and Ced-3, showed that the basic/acidic surface polarity is highly conserved, suggesting a general mode for CARD/CARD interaction."

The postsynaptic membrane has a dense thickening of submembranous cytoskeleton, called postsynaptic density (PSD) 1The abbreviations used are: PSDpostsynaptic densityNMDAN-methyl-d-aspartateNMDARNMDA receptorGKguanylate kinaseGKAPguanylate kinase-associated proteinSAPAPSAP90/PSD-95-associated proteinDAPhDLG- and PSD-95-associated proteinS-SCAMsynaptic scaffolding moleculeDRPLAdentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophyGSTglutathioneS-transferaseSPM fractionsynaptosomal membrane fraction.1The abbreviations used are: PSDpostsynaptic densityNMDAN-methyl-d-aspartateNMDARNMDA receptorGKguanylate kinaseGKAPguanylate kinase-associated proteinSAPAPSAP90/PSD-95-associated proteinDAPhDLG- and PSD-95-associated proteinS-SCAMsynaptic scaffolding moleculeDRPLAdentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophyGSTglutathioneS-transferaseSPM fractionsynaptosomal membrane fraction.

PDZ domains were originally recognized as the repeats of about 90 amino acids in PSD-95/SAP90 and named after three proteins containing such repeats, PSD-95/SAP90, Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor protein (Dlg-A), and a tight junction protein, ZO-1 (3Cho K.-O.

The first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95/SAP90 interact with NMDA receptors and Shaker type potassium channels (5Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 6Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). PSD-95/SAP90 is multimerized through the NH2-terminal disulfide linkage and clusters these receptors and channels (20Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The third PDZ domain of PSD-95/SAP90 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of neuronal cell adhesion molecules, called neuroligins (21Irie M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ichtchenko K. Toyoda A. Hirao K. Takai Y. Rosahl T.W. Sudhof T.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). PSD-95/SAP90 has one SH3 domain and one guanylate kinase (GK) domain in addition to the PDZ domains. The SH3 domain was defined as a signaling module in Src tyrosine kinase and was later identified in many other proteins (for review, see Ref. 22Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The function of the SH3 domain of PSD-95/SAP90 is unknown. The GK domain is homologous to yeast guanylate kinase and is present in various membrane-associated proteins. These proteins are thought to maintain specialized submembranous structures and are named membrane-associated guanylate kinases (for review, see Refs. 23Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Mech.

Molecules interacting with the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 have been identified by three groups and named GKAP/SAPAP/DAP (25Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.-P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J.

Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). If this observation reflects the event that precedes the formation of PSDsin vivo, SAPAP may be a core molecule of PSDs. The identification of other molecules interacting with SAPAP will yield clues to the roles of SAPAP in the formation of PSDs. We have searched for such molecules and have identified a novel protein that we named S-SCAM (synaptic scaffolding molecule). Various constructs were prepared using pBTM116, pVP16-3, pCMV5, pGex5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pGexKG, and pClneo Myc. pClneo Myc was constructed by ligating the oligonucleotides ctagaccccccaacatggagcagaagcttatcagcgaggaggacctgctcgagg/aattcctcgagcaggtcctcctcgctgataagcttctgctccatgttggggggt into NheI/EcoRI sites of pClneo (Promega). pBTM116 SAPAP1–2 contains residues 397–568 of SAPAP1. The following constructs of S-SCAM contain the following residues: pBTM116 S-SCAM-13, 413–1114; pBTM116 S-SCAM-14, 413–1277; pClneo Myc S-SCAM, 1–1277; pClneo Myc S-SCAM-2, 1–301; pClneo Myc S-SCAM-3, 295–578; pClneo Myc S-SCAM-4, 573–1277; pVP16-3 S-SCAM PDZ1, 423–508; pVP16-3 S-SCAM PDZ2, 603–689; pVP16-3 S-SCAM PDZ3, 772–861; pVP16-3 S-SCAM PDZ4, 906–1023; pVP16-3 S-SCAM PDZ5, 1134–1221; pGex S-SCAM-2, 303–584; and pGex S-SCAM-7, 1–422. pCMV NMDAR2A, pCMV neuroligin 1, pGex PSD-95-2, pGex PSD-95-4, pBTM116 NR2A, pBTM116 NL 1-1, and pBTM116 Shaker were described previously (21Irie M.

Science. 1997; 277: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). pBTM116 NR2C encodes amino acid residues 1228–1237 of NMDAR2C. Rat brain yeast two-hybrid libraries were screened using the bait constructs pBTM116 SAPAP1-2 or pBTM116 S-SCAM-13 and -14 (29Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brain λZAPII cDNA libraries (Stratagene) were screened using an uniformly labeled DNA probe from the prey clone to obtain a full-length clone of S-SCAM (29Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The [35S]methionine-labeled probes of S-SCAM were prepared using the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) with various pClneo Myc constructs as templates and quantitated by Fuji image analyzing system to adjust the amounts used for each assay. The extracts of COS cells were transferred on the nitrocellulose membrane, and the overlay assay was performed (30Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (26Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M.

After a 48-h culture, the cells from each 10-cm dish were sonicated in 0.2 ml of 50 mm Hepes/NaOH at pH 8.0 containing 100 mm NaCl and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min to collect the supernatant.

Monoclonal mouse anti-myc (Myc 1-9E10.2) and polyclonal rabbit anti-NMDAR2A antibodies were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and Chemicon, respectively. A monoclonal mouse anti-NMDAR1 antibody was a generous gift of Dr. Nils Brose (Max Planck Institute). One rat brain was homogenized in 8 ml of 0.32 m sucrose containing 4 mm Hepes/NaOH at pH 7.4 and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 9,200 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C to collect the pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of 0.32 m sucrose containing 4 mmHepes/NaOH at pH 7.4 and centrifuged 10,200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended with 4 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, with 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, and 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 2 ml of the supernatant was diluted with 4 ml of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, and incubated with 12.5 ml of protein G-Sepharose beads with either the anti-S-SCAM antibody or the preimmune serum for 5 h at 4 °C. Buffer A was diluted with 2 volumes of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, and used to wash the beads three times. The proteins on the beads were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-NMDAR1 antibody. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and transfected using the mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene). Rat hippocampal neurons were cultured as described previously (26Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Cells were stained with various antibodies and visualized using a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope. Northern and Western blottings were performed as described previously (26Takeuchi M. Hata Y.

Surface plasmon resonance was performed using BIAcore2000 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (21Irie M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ichtchenko K. Toyoda A. Hirao K. Takai Y. Rosahl T.W. Sudhof T.C.

We screened a rat brain cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid method using the residues 397–568 of SAPAP1 as a bait. This region contains the potential PSD-95/SAP90-interacting domain and a proline-rich region (Fig.1) (26Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Nine positive clones were obtained. Among them, two clones were PSD-95/SAP90, and one clone was PSD93/chapsyn (7Kim E. Cho K.-O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 32Brenman J.E. Chao D. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F.

The remaining six clones had the same novel sequence containing a GK-like domain and a WW domain. The full-length sequence of S-SCAM obtained from a rat brain cDNA library predicted synthesis of a novel protein composed of 1,277 amino acids (Fig.2). This protein had a GK-like domain at the NH2 terminus followed by two WW and five PDZ domains (Fig. 2). The GK-like domain of S-SCAM is composed of about 50 amino acids and has only a small part of the consensus amino acids of the GK domain. The first WW domain of S-SCAM is the most similar to those of YAP and Nedd-4 (33Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K. Druck T. Negrini M. Huebner K. Lehman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14733-14741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 34Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The second WW domain is incomplete and lacks the second tryptophan. The PDZ domains are distributed almost evenly from the middle to the COOH-terminal region of S-SCAM. Two sets of amino acid repeats are inserted between the fourth and fifth PDZ domains. One set is composed of four copies of a seven-amino acid sequence, SPXAQXX (underlined in Fig.2). The second set is composed of eight copies of an eight-amino acid sequence, RQPPXXDY (double-underlined in Fig. 2). The significance of these repeats is unknown. S-SCAM showed high homology to the product of K01A.6 clone of Caenorhabditis elegans, which may be a homolog of S-SCAM. During this study, MAGI-1 with a structure similar to that of S-SCAM was reported (35Dobrosotskaya I. Guy R.K. James G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31589-31597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). MAGI-1 was identified as a K-RasB-interacting protein, and three splice variants were reported. Among them, MAGI-1b is the most similar to S-SCAM and has 48% homology to S-SCAM at the amino acid level. MAGI-1 has a polyglutamine domain containing seven glutamines between the second WW domain and the first PDZ domain, whereas S-SCAM does not. WWP3, a recently identified human WW domain-containing gene (36Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), also has a sequence highly homologous to that of S-SCAM. The partial sequence of WWP3 was first reported with the accession number U96115, and later the longer sequence was reported with the accession numberU80754. U80754 was identified as a gene encoding a protein with WW domains that interacted with atrophin-1 (37Margolis R.L. Li S.-H. Young W.S. Wagster M.V. Stine O.C. Kidwai A.S. Ashworth R.G. Ross C.A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Margolis R.L. Abraham M.R. Gatchell S.B. Li S.-H. Kidwai A.S. Breschel T.S. Stine O.C. Callahan C. McInnis M.G. Ross C.A. Hum. Genet. 1997; 100: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Atrophin-1 is the product of the gene responsible for dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and has a polyglutamine repeat. The sequence of U80754also has a polyglutamine domain, and more than 80% of the amino acids are the same as those of MAGI-1, although the polyglutamine domain of WWP3 is larger than that of MAGI-1. Therefore, WWP3 is considered to be a human MAGI-1, and S-SCAM is an isoform of WWP3/MAGI-1.Figure 2Amino acid sequence of S-SCAM. S-SCAM has a GK-like domain (red), two WW domains (pink), and five PDZ domains (blue). Two sets of the repeats of amino acid residues between the fourth and fifth PDZ domains are underlined and double-underlined, respectively. Amino acid residues are shown in single-letter codes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern blot analysis showed prominent 7.5- and 6.8-kilobase messages only in brain (Fig.3 A). Proteins with molecular masses of 180, 155, and 140 kDa were detected only in brain in Western blots using polyclonal antibodies against the WW domain or NH2-terminal region of S-SCAM (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). Three proteins of 180, 155, and 140 kDa were also detected in the extracts of COS cells transfected with pCMV S-SCAM (Fig.3 B), suggesting that the proteins with smaller sizes may be the proteolytic degradation products of S-SCAM or smaller transcripts using other methionines as initiation codons. To obtain independent evidence for the interaction between SAPAP and S-SCAM, we overlaid blots of extracts of COS cells expressing various SAPAP isoforms with [35S]methionine-labeled S-SCAM. S-SCAM interacted with all of the SAPAP isoforms but not with a control protein, neurabin-l (39Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Satoh A. Wada M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). To determine the interacting domain of S-SCAM with SAPAP, probes encoding various regions of S-SCAM were prepared and used in the overlay assay with SAPAP1 (Fig. 4 B). Proteins containing the full-length or NH2-terminal region of S-SCAM (pClneo Myc S-SCAM and -2) interacted with SAPAP1, whereas proteins containing the middle or COOH-terminal region of S-SCAM (pClneo Myc S-SCAM-3 and -4) did not (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, the NH2-terminal region containing the GK-like domain is required for the interaction with SAPAP. Because PSD-95/SAP90 interacts with SAPAP through the GK domain, S-SCAM and PSD-95/SAP90 may bind to the same region of SAPAP. To test this, SAPAP1 was overlaid with [35S]methionine-labeled S-SCAM in the presence of GST-PSD-95-2 containing the PDZ domains or GST-PSD-95-4 containing the GK domain. GST-PSD-95-4 inhibited the interaction, whereas GST-PSD-95-2 did not (Fig. 4 D). Thus, S-SCAM and PSD-95/SAP90 compete for the same binding site on SAPAP, and the GK-like domain of S-SCAM may interact with SAPAP like the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90. The PDZ domains of S-SCAM showed the highest homology to those of PSD-95/SAP90 and its isoforms among the PDZ domains of various proteins. Because the PDZ domains of PSD-95/SAP90 interact with NMDA receptors, Shaker type potassium channels, and neuroligins (5Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H.

Science. 1997; 277: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), the PDZ domains of S-SCAM may also interact with these molecules. Actually, two prey clones containing amino acid residues 962–1237 and 1038–1237 of NMDAR2C were obtained in yeast two-hybrid screenings with a bait containing the PDZ domains of S-SCAM. As a next step, we tested the interactions of S-SCAM with NMDA receptors and other molecules using the yeast two-hybrid method. The β-galactosidase assays were performed using the COOH termini of NMDAR2A, -2C, neuroligin 1, and Shaker type Kv1.4 potassium channel as baits with various PDZ domains of S-SCAM as preys. The first PDZ domain interacted with neuroligin 1, whereas the fifth PDZ domain interacted with NMDA receptors and weakly with Shaker type Kv1.4 potassium channel (Table I). Therefore, S-SCAM interacts with NMDA receptors and neuroligin 1 via the distinct PDZ domains.Table IInteractions of the PDZ domains of S-SCAM with NMDA receptors, neuroligin 1, and Shaker type potassium channel in the yeast two-hybrid methodBait vector (in pBTM116)Prey vector (in pVP16–3)PDZ1PDZ2PDZ3PDZ4PDZ5NR2ANDNDNDND800 ± 20NR2CNDNDNDND640 ± 30NL1–1250 ± 35NDNDNDNDShakerNDNDNDND25 ± 1Data list β-galactosidase activities of yeast strain harboring the respective bait and prey plasmids. pVP16–3 S-SCAM PDZ1, PDZ2, PDZ3, PDZ4, and PDZ5 encode each PDZ domain of S-SCAM. pBTM116 NR2A, NR2C, NL1–1, and Shaker encode the COOH termini of NMDAR2A, −2C, neuroligin 1, and rabbit Kvl.4 potassium channel.

Data shown are nmol of substrate hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein ± S.D. after background subtraction. ND, no detectable activity. To obtain insight into their relative affinities, we studied the interactions of S-SCAM with the COOH termini of NMDAR2A and neuroligin 1 by the BIAcore biosensor technology. Synthetic peptides containing the COOH-terminal 15 amino acids of NMDAR2A or neuroligin 1 were fixed on a sensor chip. GST constructs containing various PDZ domains of S-SCAM were superfused on the chip. The first PDZ domain of S-SCAM interacted with the COOH terminus of neuroligin 1 (KD = 5.2 ± 0.5 × 10−7m), and the fifth PDZ domain of S-SCAM interacted with the COOH terminus of NMDAR2A (KD = 5.7 ± 0.3 × 10−7m). Other PDZ domains interacted with neither NMDAR2A nor neuroligin 1 in this assay (data not shown). The affinities thus determined were similar to those we measured previously for the PDZ domains of PSD-95/SAP90 with the COOH termini of NMDAR2A and neuroligin 1 (21Irie M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ichtchenko K. Toyoda A. Hirao K. Takai Y. Rosahl T.W. Sudhof T.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). To test the interactions of S-SCAM with NMDAR2A and neuroligin 1 in intact cells, we transfected HEK293 cells with various combinations of pCMV Myc S-SCAM, pCMV NMDAR2A, and pCMV neuroligin 1. S-SCAM was distributed in the cytosol, when expressed alone (Fig.5 A). NMDAR2A and neuroligin 1 were localized on the membrane, although some signals were also detected in the cytosol (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). When S-SCAM was coexpressed with NMDAR2A, S-SCAM was colocalized with NMDAR2A on the membrane (Fig. 5 C). When S-SCAM was coexpressed with neuroligin 1, S-SCAM was also colocalized with neuroligin 1 on the membrane (data not shown). These results suggest that S-SCAM is recruited to the plasma membrane by the interaction with NMDA receptors and neuroligin 1 in vivo. To determine whether S-SCAM interacts with NMDA receptors in the native environment in neurons, we performed the immunoprecipitation of S-SCAM from the detergent extract of the crude rat brain synaptosomes. Because the monoclonal antibody against NMDAR2A was not available, we used the monoclonal antibody against NMDAR1 and checked whether NMDA receptors were coimmunoprecipitated. The anti-S-SCAM antibody coimmunoprecipitated NMDAR1, whereas the preimmune serum did not (Fig.6). This result indicates that S-SCAM interacts with NMDA receptors in vivo. To examine the distribution of S-SCAM in neurons, we double-stained primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons on day 14 in the combination of anti-S-SCAM antibody with either anti-NMDAR1 or anti-PSD-95/SAP90 antibody. The staining pattern of S-SCAM was similar to that of PSD-95/SAP90, which was detected in the cell body as well as at the dendrites (Fig.7 A). S-SCAM showed distributions similar to those of NMDAR1 at dendrites (Fig.7 B). Because SAPAP was distributed in a manner similar to that of PSD-95/SAP90 (Fig. 7 C), S-SCAM was considered to be distributed in a manner similar to SAPAP. We also determined the distribution of S-SCAM in the subcellular fractions of rat brain by the immunoblotting with the anti-S-SCAM antibody. The signals detected with the antibody were distributed in both the cytosolic synaptosomal (S2) and crude synaptosomal pellet (P2) fractions (Fig. 8). In the subfractionations of synaptosomes, the signals were the most remarkable in the synaptosomal membrane fraction (SPM). The signals were also detected in the PSD fraction, although S-SCAM was not as enriched as SAPAP (Fig. 8). Synaptic junctions are asymmetric interneuronal junctions that transmit signals from a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic neuron. The pre- and postsynaptic membranes contain characteristic submembranous structures, active zones, and PSDs. It is thought that the adhesion between the pre- and postsynaptic membranes and the assembly of the components of active zones and PSDs on each membrane lead the formation of synaptic junctions. However, the molecular mechanisms of this process are unclear. Recent studies have revealed that PSD-95/SAP90 and its isoforms interact with receptors and channels through the PDZ domains and assemble them at synaptic junctions (3Cho K.-O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B.

PSD-95/SAP90 also interacts through the GK domain with proteins, which are named GKAP/SAPAP/DAP (25Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.-P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 26Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Akiyama T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although the functions of GKAP/SAPAP/DAP are not yet clear, they are tightly associated with PSDs and recruit PSD-95/SAP90 to the membranes in transfected cells. Therefore, GKAP/SAPAP/DAP may be a core protein of PSDs, and various components of PSDs may be assembled around GKAP/SAPAP/DAP. In this study, we have obtained a novel protein interacting with SAPAP and named it S-SCAM. S-SCAM is similar to the recently reported protein, WWP3/MAGI-1. In contrast to WWP3/MAGI-1, S-SCAM is expressed only in brain and considered to be a neuronal isoform of WWP3/MAGI-1. S-SCAM is distributed both in the cytosol and membrane fractions in rat brain. In the further subfractionation, S-SCAM is recovered in the SPM fraction. Even after Triton X-100 extractions, a significant amount of S-SCAM is insoluble and detected in the PSD fraction. The amount of S-SCAM recovered in the PSD fraction is less than that in the SPM fraction, suggesting that S-SCAM is not as tightly attached to PSDs as SAPAP is. Consistently, in rat hippocampal neurons, S-SCAM is also detected in the cell body. The distribution of S-SCAM is reminiscent of that of PSD-95/SAP90. PSD-95/SAP90 is localized in the cytosol and membrane fractions in rat brain and detected in the cell body as well as at the synaptic junctions in rat hippocampal neurons. The reason why some S-SCAM and PSD-95/SAP90 are soluble and others are insoluble is currently unclear. S-SCAM and PSD-95/SAP90 may be peripheral components of PSDs and recruited from the cytosol to PSDs. The domain structure of S-SCAM at the same time is similar to that of PSD-95/SAP90 and differs from it. Both proteins contain GK-like or GK domains, but these are localized at different ends of the proteins. In both proteins, these domains bind SAPAP. Both S-SCAM and PSD-95/SAP90 have protein modules specialized for binding proline-rich sequences, but in S-SCAM this module is a WW domain and in PSD-95/SAP90 an SH3 domain. The WW domain is reported to bind to a peptide containingXPPXY (40Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). SAPAP does not have this motif, and the ligand for the WW domain of S-SCAM remains to be identified. Atrophin-1, the product of DRPLA gene, was reported to interact with the WW domains of WWP3/MAGI-1 (37Margolis R.L. Li S.-H. Young W.S. Wagster M.V. Stine O.C. Kidwai A.S. Ashworth R.G. Ross C.A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Margolis R.L. Abraham M.R. Gatchell S.B. Li S.-H. Kidwai A.S. Breschel T.S. Stine O.C. Callahan C. McInnis M.G. Ross C.A. Hum. Genet. 1997; 100: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because the WW domains are highly conserved between S-SCAM and WWP3/MAGI-1, atrophin-1 is likely to bind to S-SCAM. Another similarity between S-SCAM and PSD-95/SAP90 is that both of the proteins have PDZ domains that bind to NMDA receptors and neuroligins. However, S-SCAM has five PDZ domains, whereas PSD-95/SAP90 has three. The first PDZ domain of S-SCAM interacts with the COOH termini of neuroligins, and the fifth PDZ domain binds to the COOH termini of NMDA receptors. These findings suggest that each PDZ domain has a distinct partner and that the second, third, and fourth PDZ domains may interact with other proteins besides NMDA receptors and neuroligins. Thereby, S-SCAM may function as a novel scaffolding molecule to assemble various components at synaptic junctions and may cooperate with PSD-95/SAP90 to maintain the structure of synaptic junctions. Several neurodegenerative diseases, including spinobulbular muscular atrophy, Huntington disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, Machado-Joseph disease, and DRPLA, arise from expansion of a CAG repeat-encoding glutamine (41La Spada A.R.

Atrophin-1 with a polyglutamine repeat composed of 14 glutamines was identified to be the gene responsible for DRPLA and reported to interact with the WW domains of WWP3/MAGI-1 (37Margolis R.L.

Interestingly, WWP3/MAGI-1 also has a polyglutamine repeat, and the expansion mutation in WWP3/MAGI-1 might cause the phenotype similar to DRPLA. As discussed above, S-SCAM is likely to interact with atrophin-1 via the WW domains and may be involved in the pathogenesis of DRPLA.

We report that either oncostatin M (OSM) or IL-6 plus soluble IL-6 receptor increased the levels of p21 mRNA and protein in the osteoblast-like human osteosarcoma cell line MG63 and stimulated the activity of a 2.4-kilobase pair segment of the human p21 gene promoter. Further, nuclear extracts from cytokine-stimulated MG63 cells formed protein-DNA complexes with a 19-base pair nucleotide fragment of the p21 promoter containing a single STAT response element. The identity of the binding proteins as Stat3 and Stat1 was demonstrated with specific antibodies. In addition, and in support of a mediating role of STATs in the activation of the p21 promoter, overexpression of Stat3 potentiated the cytokine effect on the p21 promoter; whereas a dominant negative Stat3, or a mutation of the STAT response element on the promoter, significantly reduced the cytokine effect. Finally, antisense oligonucleotides complementary to p21 mRNA inhibited OSM-induced stimulation of alkaline phosphatase expression and antagonized the protective effect of OSM on anti-Fas-induced apoptosis.

To date, p21 has been implicated in three different processes: DNA damage repair, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the former, p21 gene expression is stimulated by the tumor suppressor gene p53, and the protein arrests cells in the G1 phase in order to allow the DNA damage repair process to be performed before cells reenter the S phase (7Sheikh M.S.

It is now established that cytokines such as IL-6 can influence bone resorption and formation by regulating the production of osteoclasts and osteoblasts (reviewed in Ref. 18Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L.

Indeed, IL-6, IL-11, LIF, and OSM are produced by cells of the stromal/osteoblastic lineage in response to local factors and systemic hormones, and they stimulate osteoclast differentiation from hematopoietic precursors. In addition, they modulate the rate of proliferation and promote the differentiation of osteoblast progenitors and committed osteoblastic cells from rodent and human origin (18Manolagas S.C.

Moreover, IL-6 type cytokines suppress osteoblastic cell apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal, glucocorticoids, tumor necrosis factor, or the Fas pathway (22Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T.

Res. 1997; 12 (abstr.): S455Google Scholar). The receptors for all these cytokines share a common signal-transducing component known as gp130 (24Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced dimerization of gp130 initiates intracellular signaling by activating members of the Janus kinase family of tyrosine kinases (25Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1993; 74: 587-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This step induces the recruitment, tyrosine phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of STATs, which activate transcription of cytokine-responsive genes (26Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 27Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Because of evidence that p21WAF1,CIP1,SDI1 is induced during cell differentiation and confers resistance to apoptosis in some cell types, we have investigated whether this gene is regulated by IL-6 type cytokines and whether it plays a role in their actions on osteoblasts. For these studies, we utilized an established human osteosarcoma cell line, MG63, which exhibits many features of normal osteoblastic cells and has been used extensively as a model of this cell type (28Majeska R.L. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 1229-1237Google Scholar). MG63 cells express high levels of the OSM receptor β and low levels of the ligand binding (α) subunit of the IL-6 receptor (29Bellido T. Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Borba V. Yancopoulos G.D. Manolagas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); hence, the gp130 signal pathway can be activated by OSM or by the combination of IL-6 with sIL-6R. We have previously reported that such activation leads to cell cycle arrest and a simultaneous increase in the expression of the phenotypic marker AP (19Bellido T. Borba V.Z.C. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3666-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and prevents Fas-induced apoptosis (22Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C.

Here, we present evidence that activation of the gp130/STAT signal transduction pathway by IL-6 type cytokines leads to the transcriptional activation of the p21WAF1,CIP1,SDI1 gene, and that p21 is a critical mediator of the differentiation-promoting and anti-apoptotic actions of these cytokines on osteoblastic cells.

Cassiman J.J. Mulier J.C. Desomer P. Oncology. 1978; 35: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were cultured in phenol red-free MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were kept in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.14 unit/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. Insoluble material was pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein lysates were dissolved in buffer for protein electrophoresis, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk, and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with an antibody to either p21, p53, or β-actin, followed by incubation for 1 h with the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated with HRP. Blots were developed by ECL, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Quantification of the intensity of the bands in the autoradiograms was performed by laser densitometry. Total cellular RNA was isolated from semiconfluent control or cytokine-treated cultures, and polyadenylated RNA was selected as described previously (29Bellido T. Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Borba V. Yancopoulos G.D. Manolagas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Messenger RNA was separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and fixed by heating at 80 °C under vacuum for 2 h. Blots were probed with radiolabeled cDNAs for p21 or for actin, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described elsewhere (19Bellido T. Borba V.Z.C. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3666-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Eighty to 90% confluent cultures of MG63 cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 2 h and stimulated with 50 ng/ml OSM for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed once with PBS, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Cells (4–7 × 107) were washed with hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and were lysed for 10 min on ice in 30 μl/107 cells of the same buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 30 μl/107 cells of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol) and were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. Lysed nuclei were dispersed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were collected, snap frozen, and stored at −70 °C. A synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the most proximal Stat binding element (p21-SIE1: -640 nucleotides from the TATA promoter site) present in the p21 promoter (5′-GATCTCCTTCCCGGAAGCA-3′) (3el-Deiry W.S.

The probe (1 ng) was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 10 μg of nuclear proteins in a solution containing 50 μg/ml double-stranded salmon sperm DNA, 6% glycerol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA, in the absence or presence of 100 × molar excess unlabeled SIE1 wild type oligonucleotide or unlabeled mutated SIE1 (SIE1M: 5′-GATCTCCAAGCTTGAAGCA-3′). Supershift experiments were performed by incubating the nuclear proteins with either non-immune IgG, anti-Stat1α antibody, or anti-Stat3 antibody, for 10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the labeled probe. Transient transfections of MG63 cells were carried out in 12-well culture plates using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) and the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Cells were transfected with 2.5–3 μg of a p21-luc reporter construct containing a 2.4-kb segment of the human p21 gene promoter (or an identical segment in which the putative STAT binding segment was mutated as described below) inserted into the firefly luciferase reporter gene, pGL2-basic (3el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Volgestein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar, 11Liu M.

Reporter plasmids were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of the expression plasmid for Stat3 or the empty vector (30Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.-W.J. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13221-13227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with OSM (20 ng/ml) for the indicated times, and dual luciferase activity was analyzed in cell lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions. Light intensity was measured with a Turner luminometer, and firefly luciferase activity was normalized versus Renilla luciferase activity. For oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, a 30-base oligonucleotide was synthesized as the reverse complement of the p21 sense strand containing a mutation in the SIE1 sequence (−660 nucleotides from the TATA promoter site: 5′-GTCACATGCTTCAAGCTTGGAGGGAATTGG-3′). This was used to anneal and extend the wild type single-stranded template generated from p21-luc, a plasmid containing a 2.4-kbHindIII segment of the human p21 gene promoter inserted into the firefly luciferase reporter gene, pGL2-basic (11Liu M. Lee M.-H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The mutation incorporated a HindIII restriction site that was used for the selection of mutated plasmids, and it was confirmed by sequencing (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar). Phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (15.7 μm) and Lipofectin (3 × 10−4 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The mixture was diluted with serum-containing medium to a final concentration of 1 μm oligonucleotides, and added to the cells. Antisense oligonucleotides were based on the p21WAF1,CIP1,SDI1 coding sequence. AS-IC is complementary to the region around the initiation codon (5′-TCC CCA GCC GGT TCT GAC AT-3′), AS-MID is complementary to the middle of the coding region (5′-CCT CCA GTG GTG TCT CGG TG-3′), AS-3′ is complementary to the 3′ end (5′-TGT CAT GCT GGT CTG CCG CC-3′), and the control sense oligonucleotide S-IC is complementary to the AS-IC (5′-ATG TCA GAA CCG GCT GGG GA-3′). AP activity was determined as previously reported (19Bellido T. Borba V.Z.C. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3666-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). MG63 cells were suspended in medium containing 10% FBS and cultured in 96-well plates to 85–90% confluence. Medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 5% FBS, and cells were cultured with or without 20 ng/ml OSM in the absence or presence of 1 μm phosphorothioate oligonucleotides for 3 days (8 replicas per condition). Media were removed and cells were fixed in 10% formalin PBS buffer. The amount of cells per well was estimated using an assay based on the reduction of the tetrazolium derivative, MTS, coupled to LDH, using a microtiter plate reader. Monolayers were washed once with distilled water and three times with 0.2 mTris, pH 8.2. 75 μl of 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.2, was then added to each well. Subsequently, 75 μl of 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.2, containing 1.3 × 10−3m NAD, 5.4 × 10−2ml-(+)-lactic acid, 6 mg/ml MTS, and 2.572 units/ml diaphorase, was added to each well, and readings at 490 nm and at 750 nm were taken at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min, in a plate reader using Time Management Software (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA). After MTS/LDH detection, cells were washed three times with 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. Subsequently, 75 μl of AP buffer and 75 μl of AP substrate were added to each well, and readings at 410 and 750 nm were taken at the same time points. Results are expressed as ratios of AP rate (OD/min) to MTS/LDH rate (OD/min). Apoptosis of human osteoblast-like MG63 cells was induced as described previously (22Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 24 h in MEM containing 10% FBS in the absence or presence of 0.1 nm γ-IFN, alone or in combination with 20 ng/ml OSM. The medium was then replaced with 10% FBS-MEM containing 10 μg/ml anti-Fas antibody with or without OSM. Cells were cultured for an additional 16 h, and apoptotic cells were quantified by trypan blue staining. Nonadherent cells were combined with adherent cells released from the culture dish using trypsin-EDTA, and resuspended in PBS. Subsequently, 0.4% trypan blue was added, and the percentage of cells exhibiting both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was determined using a hemocytometer. At least 200 cells per condition were counted. We have previously demonstrated that the percentage of cells exhibiting trypan blue staining correlates with the percentage of TUNEL-labeled cells, indicating that apoptotic osteoblasts could be reliably quantified by either method (22Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). For the statistical analysis of the data of Fig. 7, standardized means and standard errors were calculated using the variance for the ratio of two random variables (35Stuart A. Ord K. Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics:. Distribution Theory. Oxford University Press, New York1987Google Scholar). Approximate ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the standardized means of the OSM-treated groups were calculated as the standardized mean ± 2 standard errors. Confidence bounds with a lower limit greater than 1 were considered to denote a significant (p < 0.05) increase over the corresponding control group. For the analysis of the data regarding the effects of OSM on AP in the presence of oligonucleotides (Fig. 8 B), standardized OSM AP/MTS values were calculated by dividing each replica of the OSM-treated group by the mean of the corresponding basal group. These values were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, and, subsequently, each oligonucleotide group was compared with the group without oligonucleotide using the Dunnet's test and an experiment-wise significance level of 0.05. In addition, an analysis using Dunnet's test to compare all antisense oligonucleotide groups to the group treated with sense oligonucleotide was also conducted. Data of Fig.8 C were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, and Dunnet's test was utilized to estimate the level of significance of differences between means.Figure 8Increases in p21 protein are required for the pro-differentiating and anti-apoptotic effects of OSM on osteoblasts. A, cells were incubated with the indicated oligonucleotides for 30 min before the addition of 20 ng/ml OSM. After 6 h, cells were lysed, and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed sequentially with anti-p21 and anti-β-actin antibodies, as in Fig. 1. B, cells were cultured with or without 20 ng/ml OSM, and in the presence or absence of the indicated oligonucleotides for 3 days (8 replicas/condition). The standardized OSM AP/MTS were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and compared with the group without oligonucleotide or with the group with sense oligonucleotide using Dunnet's test. Each antisense oligonucleotide reduced OSM response compared with that of the no oligonucleotide group, or with that of the sense oligonucleotide group (*, p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments. C, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 0.1 nm γ-IFN, alone or in combination with 20 ng/ml OSM. Apoptosis was induced by addition of anti-Fas antibody, and the percentage of dead cells was determined as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are the averages of triplicate wells, in which more than 200 cells per condition were counted. Bars represent means ± S.D. Differences between means were analyzed by ANOVA. * indicates differences statistically significant (p < 0.05) versuscells treated with γ-IFN+αFas, by Dunnet's test. Two additional experiments showed similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MG63 cells cultured in the presence of OSM exhibited an increase in the levels of p21 protein, as detected by Western blot analysis (Fig.1 A). This effect was evident as early as 2 h of treatment and remained present for at least 24 h. By 48 h, p21 levels had returned to base-line levels. Similar increases in p21 protein expression were found when IL-6 in combination with sIL-6R was used in these experiments instead of OSM (Fig. 1 B). However, there was no change in the levels of p53 protein in cells treated with OSM (Fig. 1 A). Consistent with the results of the Western blot analysis, p21 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry in MG63 cells maintained under basal conditions and OSM increased the staining (Fig. 2,upper panels). Nuclear staining was abolished when preparations were incubated with the anti-p21 antibody together with the peptide to which the antibody was raised (lower panels).Figure 2gp130 activation increases p21 protein expression. MG63 cells plated on two-well chamber slides were cultured in the absence (Control) or presence (OSM) of 20 ng/ml OSM for 6 h. Cells were fixed with cold 100% methanol and stained with anti-p21 antibody (upper panels) or with anti-p21 antibody plus a 10-fold excess of the peptide to which the antibody was generated (lower panels).

Both pathways involve the activation of a family of cysteine proteinases, the caspases, that cleave substrates at aspartic acid and are themselves activated by cleavage at internal aspartate residues. Fas recruits caspase 8, which initiates the death program through the subsequent activation of caspase 3. Granzyme B can process both caspase 8 and 3 in vitro, suggesting that both Fas and granzyme B access the apoptotic program in the same way. Here we demonstrate that although the two mechanisms are similar, the events that lead to activation of caspase 3 can be distinguished in vivo on the basis of their sensitivities to both pharmacological and virus-encoded caspase inhibitors. In cytotoxic T lymphocytes-mediated death the initial cleavage event on caspase 3 is insensitive to benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) inhibition in both mouse and human systems. During Fas-mediated death, however, activation of caspase 3 is completely inhibited to zVAD-fmk. In addition, the viral serpin SPI-2, a homologue of cytokine response modifier A (crmA), is an effective inhibitor of the Fas but not the granzyme pathway. Our results demonstrate that whereas Fas-mediated activation of caspase 3 requires an upstream caspase activity that is zVAD-fmk-sensitive, the initial cleavage of caspase 3 during granule-mediated cell death is insensitive to zVAD-fmk, suggesting that caspase 3 is cleaved directly by granzyme Bin vivo.

Both the calcium-dependent, perforin/granzyme-mediated, and the calcium-independent Fas ligand/Fas (Apo-1/CD95)-mediated CTL lytic pathways cause target cell destruction by activating members of the caspase family and initiating an apoptotic protease cascade. Fas ligand engagement of Fas on the target cell results in the direct recruitment of caspase 8 (FLICE/MACH/Mch5) to the activated Fas complex and results in the proteolytic activation of this enzyme (3Muzio M.

Since caspase 3 was the first identified substrate for granzyme B, it was initially proposed that direct cleavage and activation of this caspase explained its mode of action. However, with the numbers of granzyme B caspase substrates increasing steadily, it is possible that both direct and indirect (that is, via other granzyme B-activated caspases) activation of caspase 3 is involved in granzyme B-initiated apoptosis. Specifically, since the apoptotic pathways initiated by both granzyme B and Fas converge at caspase 3, it is of great interest to determine whether they share a common pathway proximal to this point. In fact, it is conceivable that since caspase 8, the caspase that is recruited to an activated Fas complex, activates caspase 3 (23Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrilli J. Robertson N.

To investigate the similarities between Fas- and granzyme B-mediated apoptosis of susceptible target cells, we examined the effects of two different peptide-based inhibitors of caspases and a virus-encoded caspase inhibitor on DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 cleavage. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) is a general pan-specific caspase inhibitor and benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (zDEVD-fmk) is a specific inhibitor of caspase 3-like enzymes. Granzyme B activity is not affected by either of these peptide inhibitors (19Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.-T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

SPI-2, like crmA, has previously been shown to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis in a similar fashion to crmA (25Macen J.L. Garner R.S. Musy P.-Y. Brooks M.A. Turner P.C. Moyer R.W. McFadden G.

We found that the two lytic pathways were clearly distinguishable based upon the patterns of inhibition of caspase 3 activation by the peptide inhibitors and also by SPI-2 inhibition. Jurkat and L1210 target cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with antibiotics, sodium pyruvate, β-mercaptoethanol, HEPES, and 5% fetal calf serum (RHFM). Jurkats were stably transfected with BMGneo-SPI-2 and BMGneo via electroporation (250 V, 250 microfarads) (28Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Stably transfected Jurkats were selected in 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and cloned by limiting dilution. Once selected, the resulting cells were routinely grown in RHFM containing 0.8 mg/ml G418. Human lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood by centrifugation through Ficoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The harvested lymphocytes were incubate at 4 × 105 cells/ml with irradiated Epstein-Barr virus-transformed RPMI-8666 cells (5000 rad) at a 5:1 ratio (lymphocytes:RPMI-8666). After 3 days in culture, the human CTL (hCTL) were separated from the dead RMPI-8666 cells by centrifugation through Ficoll. The hCTL were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 90 units/ml recombinant interleukin 2 (Chiron). hCTL were restimulated on a weekly basis with irradiated RPMI-8666 cells at a ratio of 1:2 (lymphocytes:RPMI-8666). CTL cell lines from wild type, granzyme A knockout, and granzyme B knockout mice were initially generated in a mixed lymphocyte culture by obtaining splenocytes from the responder mice (all H-2b) and stimulating them with an equal number of H-2dγ-irradiated splenocytes from Balb/c mice. Cultures were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 90 units/ml interleukin 2. The effector cells lines were restimulated with irradiated Balb/c splenocytes on a weekly basis. One day before use in the DNA fragmentation assays, the CTL lines were stimulated with anti-CD3ε antibody 145–2C11 to ensure potent up-regulation of the granule-dependent lytic pathway. Murine anti-human Fas antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. and routinely used at 100 ng/ml. Rabbit anti-caspase 3, which specifically recognizes the p17 subunit of caspase 3, was the kind gift of Dr. Donald Nicholson (Merck Frosst Center for Therapeutic Research, Quebec, Canada) and used at a dilution of 1:10,000 for Western blots. Donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from Amersham and used at a dilution of 1:6,000. The peptide inhibitors zVAD-fmk and zDEVD-fmk (Kamiya Biomedical) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and used at varying concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 100 μm as indicated. 51Chromium and [3H]thymidine were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Cytolytic activity was assessed by measuring 51chromium release, and DNA fragmentation was assessed by measuring [3H]thymidine release as described previously (29Garner R. Helgason C.D. Atkinson E.A. Pinkoski M.J. Ostergaard H.L. Sorensen O. Fu A. Lapchak P.H. Rabinovitch A. McElhaney J.E. Berke G. Bleackley R.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5413-5421PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, target cells were labeled with 100 μCi of 51Cr for 60 min, or target cell DNA was labeled by overnight incubation with 1.5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine in RHFM. After labeling, cells were washed twice in label-free RHFM and incubated in fresh media for at least 1 h, after which they were washed two more times and counted. When necessary the target cells were pretreated with the peptide inhibitors zVAD-fmk or zDEVD-fmk at double the concentrations indicated for 1 h at 37°C. They were then incubated with an equal volume of CTL effectors (1 × 105 targets, effector:target (E:T) = 2:1) for either 2 or 4 h or anti-human Fas IgM antibody (100 ng/ml) for 7 h in the presence or absence of the peptide inhibitors at 37°C. The extent of [3H]DNA fragmentation was assessed by lysing the cells in an equal volume of 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. The tubes were vortexed well and centrifuged at 14000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4° C for 10 min. Half the supernatant from each tube was removed and counted in a Beckman scintillation counter in 3 ml of ACS scintillant (Amersham). Percent DNA fragmentation and percent cell lysis was calculated using the formula % specific fragmentation = 100 × (experimental released DNA − spontaneous released DNA)/(total labeled DNA − spontaneous released DNA). Total labeled DNA was obtained by lysing target cells in 1% SDS instead of 0.5% Triton X-100, and spontaneous release was determined by incubation of targets in the absence of CTL or anti-human Fas. All experiments were done in triplicate. 1 × 106unlabeled target cells were pretreated with the caspase inhibitors or Me2SO control at 37 °C for 1 h. They were either incubated with anti-Fas antibody (100 ng/ml) for 7 h, granzyme A knockout CTL (E:T = 2:1), or hCTL (E:T = 2:1) for up to 2 h at 37° C. Postnuclear supernatants of cell lysates were harvested at the indicated times and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using an anti-caspase 3 primary antibody (1:10,000). Western blots were visualized using a donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:6,000) followed by Amersham ECL detection as described previously (30Darmon A.J. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21699-21702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Initially, we assessed the effects of the caspase inhibitors zVAD-fmk and zDEVD-fmk on DNA fragmentation resulting from granzyme B or Fas. In our experiments the Fas pathway was engaged by treating cells with anti-Fas IgM antibody. The granzyme B pathway was specifically accessed using granule-dependent allo-specific CTLs generated from granzyme A knockout mice (31Ebnet K. Hausmann M. Lehmann-Grube F. Mullbacher A. Kopf M. Lamers M. Simon M.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4230-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) with allo-specific CTLs from granzyme B knockouts (32Shresta S. MacIvor D.M. Heusel J.W. Russell J.H.

The use of the two different knockout mice allowed us to be confident that the effects we observed were indeed due to granzyme B. As shown in Fig.1, both zVAD-fmk and zDEVD-fmk were extremely potent inhibitors of DNA fragmentation induced by the granule-exocytosis pathway and by Fas ligation, confirming the importance of caspases in both these lytic mechanisms. Fas-based DNA fragmentation appeared to be more sensitive to both zVAD-fmk and zDEVD-fmk inhibition, with essentially total inhibition occurring at an inhibitor concentration of 12.5–25 μm. DNA fragmentation induced by allo-specific granzyme A−/− CTL was less sensitive to both inhibitors and required 100 μmzDEVD-fmk for total inhibition. Granzyme B-deficient CTL caused no detectable DNA fragmentation, confirming that the DNA fragmentation seen with wild type and granzyme A knockout CTL was due to granzyme B activity and once more underscoring the importance of this enzyme in causing the rapid apoptotic nuclear events mediated by degranulation-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (6Shi L.

Allo-specific CTL generated from wild type mice gave results that were essentially identical to that of the granzyme A−/− CTL (data not shown). Thus, both the Fas- and granzyme B-mediated lytic pathways involve caspase activation and can be inhibited by zVAD-fmk and zDEVD-fmk. Processing of caspase 3 into its fully active form is a two-step process, with initial activation occurring via caspase or granzyme B cleavage at aspartate 175, located between the large and small subunit domains (14Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H. Casiano C.A. O'Brien G.A. Fitzgerald P. Tan E.M. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg A.H. Green D.R.

Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). This results in the creation of a ∼12-kDa (p12) small subunit and a ∼20-kDa (p20) fragment that is composed of the large subunit and the prodomain. Autocatalytic removal of the N-terminal prodomain at aspartate 9 then generates a ∼19-kDa (p19) large subunit (Fig. 2). Since caspase 3 is a common target for both Fas and granzyme B-initiated apoptosis, and since it is clearly a key regulatory caspase for DNA fragmentation, we were interested in defining the effects of the zVAD-fmk and zDEVD-fmk inhibitors on the processing and molecular activation of this enzyme. As seen in Fig.3, when Fas-sensitive Jurkat cells were treated with the general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk and then exposed to anti-Fas antibody, there was no detectable occurrence of caspase 3 cleavage, even at the relatively low inhibitor concentration of 25 μm. Under these conditions, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was not detected (data not shown). This indicated that a zVAD-fmk-sensitive caspase was required for the initial caspase 3 activation upon Fas ligation. In contrast, when the cells were first treated with the zDEVD-fmk, caspase 3 was cleaved to its intermediate ∼20-kDa band by a relatively zDEVD-fmk-insensitive protease, but the processing was then arrested, and the enzyme would not autoprocess itself to the mature ∼19 k-a large subunit (the antibody used does not recognize the ∼12-kDa small subunit). This pattern was seen at both low (25 μm) and high (100 μm) concentrations of the inhibitor. A moderate inhibition on the generation of the ∼20-kDa band was observed at 25 μmzDEVD-fmk, and a more pronounced inhibition was observed at 100 μm. This observation may reflect, at least in part, the ability of caspase 8, the most proximal caspase in the Fas system, to be inhibited by zDEVD-fmk (23Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrilli J. Robertson N. Armstrong R.C. Wang L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27099-27106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Thus, Fas ligation results in the activation of caspases that lead to caspase 3 processing, which are exquisitely sensitive to zVAD-fmk and inhibited to some degree by zDEVD-fmk. We conclude that the inhibition of DNA fragmentation seen in Fig. 1 was due to complete abrogation of caspase 3 processing with zVAD-fmk and a combination of inhibition of both the activity and processing of caspase 3 by zDEVD-fmk. We next evaluated the effects of these same inhibitors on caspase 3 activation by the granzyme B-mediated lytic pathway. These experiments were conducted at a low effector to target ratio (2:1) to more closely duplicate CTL attack in vivo. The results are depicted in Fig. 4. In direct contrast to the effects of zVAD-fmk on Fas-initiated caspase 3 activation, the ∼20 kDa fragment was generated in the presence of both low and high concentrations of zVAD-fmk, indicating that this inhibitor did not block the initial processing of caspase 3 in the granzyme B-initiated pathway as it did in the Fas system. There did, however, appear to be a slight inhibition of the production of the ∼20-kDa band, which we estimate by densitometric scanning of the combined ∼20- and ∼19-kDa bands to be approximately 30% in the 25 μm zVAD-fmk sample (Fig. 4 and data not shown). When the target cells were treated with 25 μm zDEVD-fmk inhibitor, generation of the ∼20 kDa caspase 3 fragment was entirely unaffected, but the caspase 3 autoprocessing step that generates the ∼19-kDa fragment was inhibited. At 100 μm zDEVD-fmk, there was evidence of some inhibition of the initial processing of caspase 3 to generate the ∼20-kDa fragment, and the autoprocessing step that forms the ∼ 19-kDa subunit was entirely blocked. Earlier experiments using wild type CTL gave identical results to those with the granzyme A−/− CTL (data not shown). Therefore, the initial activation of caspase 3 is performed by a protease that is largely resistant to both zVAD-fmk and zDEVD-fmk. The most likely candidate is granzyme B itself. It was interesting to note that the degree of inhibition of the production of the ∼19-kDa mature subunit by the two concentrations of both zVAD-fmk and zDEVD-fmk reflects the degree of inhibition these peptides displayed in the DNA fragmentation experiments. That is, there was significant but incomplete inhibition at 25 μm and complete inhibition at 100 μm (see Figs. 1 and 4). This further illustrates the direct association between caspase 3 activity and DNA fragmentation. It should be noted that the clone of L1210 used was selected as the target for the granule effectors because of its low level of Fas expression (30Darmon A.J. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21699-21702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate that caspase 3 can be processed to the p20 subunit by a zVAD-fmk-insensitive protease. However, to establish that this first processing event is indeed due to the direct action of granzyme B, we analyzed the timing of the activation of caspase 3 in Jurkat cells in the presence of hCTL, which kills predominantly via the calcium-dependent granule-mediated pathway. The experiment was performed in both the presence and absence of the zVAD-fmk (Fig.5, A and B). The earliest point at which the cleavage of caspase 3 was observed in either cells, treated or untreated with the peptide inhibitor, was 15 min. In the absence of zVAD-fmk, we saw the appearance of the p20 and p19, whereas in the presence of the inhibitor only p20 was seen at this early time. As noted earlier (Fig. 4), the appearance of p19 occurred only in the absence of inhibitor. We conclude that there is no difference in the kinetics of caspase 3 activation in the presence or absence of zVAD-fmk. Our results differ slightly from those of Talanianet al. (36Talanian R.V. Yang X.H. Turbov J. Seth P. Ghayur T. Casiano C.A. Orth K. Froelich C.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), who reported some retardation in caspase 3 activation in the presence of caspase inhibitors. However, it should be noted that these investigators were using an in vitro system to induce lysis, whereas we have performed our experiments with both human and mouse CTL. Thus with both human and mouse CTL, the initial cleavage of caspase 3 appears to be insensitive to the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. Indeed a recently reported study demonstrates that caspase 3 cleavage to the p20 subunit is insensitive to zVAD-fmk as well as zDEVD-fmk and benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (zIETD-fmk), results that are entirely compatible with our own (35Medema J.P. Toes R.E. M Scaffidi C. Zheng T.S. Flavell R.A. Melief C.J.M. Peter M.E. Offringa R. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3492-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In fact in the presence of zVAD-fmk, zDEVD-fmk, or zIETD-fmk, the level of the cleaved p20 subunit was found to increase, an observation that was also made in this study (Fig. 5), yet surprisingly the authors conclude that activation of caspase 3 is granzyme B-independent. To test whether or not activation of caspase 3 is relevant to the granzyme B pathway, target cells were transfected with the rabbitpox virus serpin SPI-2, the rabbitpox virus equivalent to cowpox virus crmA, which is a potent inhibitor of caspase 1 and caspase 8 (3Muzio M.

Two independent, stably transfected clones were analyzed for sensitivity to Fas- and granzyme-induced killing. Both SPI-2-transfected clones (Fig. 6,A and B) demonstrated a significant resistance to DNA fragmentation (∼75% inhibition) and membrane damage (∼50% inhibition) when treated with anti-Fas antibody. Our results are in agreement with previous studies, which demonstrate that both crmA and SPI-2 are potent inhibitors of Fas-mediated cell death (25Macen J.L. Garner R.S. Musy P.-Y.

In contrast, the same cells demonstrated no protection from granule-mediated cell death induced by the presence of hCTL (Fig. 6,C and D). The involvement of the granzyme pathway in hCTL-induced killing was confirmed by sensitivity to calcium chelation. Thus, although SPI-2 is an effective inhibitor of the Fas pathway, it does not appear to impinge upon granzyme-mediated killing. This result is consistent with published data indicating that the SPI-2-related cowpox virus crmA gene product is a potent Fas inhibitor but has no effect on granule-mediated cell death (42Tewari M.

Thus, our experiments suggest that the activation of caspase 8 is not necessary for granule-mediated cell death since the presence of SPI-2 is unable to provide adequate protection. These results rule out the involvement of caspases 1 and 8, which previously have been shown to be involved in Fas killing and are inhibited by crmA (3Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C.

Telford W.G. Miller R.A. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22705-22708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), is unable to inhibit granzyme-mediated cell death. Previous studies from our laboratory have also indicated that the deletion of SPI-2 from the genome of rabbitpox virus has no effect on the ability of CTL to induce granule-mediated cell death on mutant rabbitpox virus-infected cells, a result that is consistent with the data presented in this study (25Macen J.L. Garner R.S. Musy P.-Y. Brooks M.A. Turner P.C. Moyer R.W. McFadden G. Bleackley R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9108-9113Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). An inhibition of granule-mediated cell death was only observed when both SPI-1 and SPI-2 were deleted from the genome, indicating that SPI-1 and SPI-2 may act in synergy to inhibit granule-mediated cell death (25Macen J.L. Garner R.S. Musy P.-Y. Brooks M.A. Turner P.C. Moyer R.W. McFadden G. Bleackley R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9108-9113Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results indicate that the production of mature, activated caspase 3 occurs by distinct pathways in apoptosis initiated by Fas and granzyme B. In Fas-mediated apoptosis, activation of caspase 3 occurs via an upstream caspase that is exquisitely sensitive to the peptide inhibitor zVAD-fmk and the presence of the serine proteinase inhibitor SPI-2. zVAD-fmk totally shuts down the initial processing of caspase 3 and consequently caspase 3-mediated DNA fragmentation. The inhibitor zDEVD-fmk also inhibits DNA fragmentation in the Fas system but does so by blocking the ability of caspase 3 to autoprocess itself after the initial activation and production of the ∼20-kDa intermediate fragment has occurred. In granzyme B-mediated apoptosis, on the other hand, zVAD-fmk inhibition also inhibits DNA fragmentation but for a different reason. In the presence of zVAD-fmk, the initial processing of caspase 3 and the generation of the ∼20-kDa intermediate is largely unaffected, similar to the effects of zDEVD-fmk. However, zVAD-fmk, like zDEVD-fmk, substantially interferes with the ability of caspase 3 to complete its own processing, and the generation of the ∼19-kDa mature large subunit of the enzyme is blocked. Additionally, SPI-2 is unable to protect cells from granule-mediated cell death, ruling out an essential role for caspase 8 in the perforin and granzyme B pathway of cell death. Therefore, it is very unlikely that the granzyme B and Fas mechanisms of target cell destruction share a common pathway before caspase 3 activation. Our results support the model in which Fas activates caspase 8, which then acts directly or indirectly to activate caspase 3, whereas granzyme B mainly acts directly on caspase 3. The results described here suggest that granzyme B activates caspase 3 directly during CTL-mediated killing. We cannot officially rule out the possibility that caspase 3 is activated by a zVAD-fmk-insensitive caspase. However, since zVAD-fmk is believed to be a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, it seems unlikely that any of the currently identified caspases are involved. This places the site of action of granzyme B at the effector end of the caspase cascade and thus offers fewer intermediate steps for potential inhibition. However, our data indicate that upstream caspase(s) are likely also involved, since the further processing of caspase 3 from p20 to p19 is zVAD-fmk-sensitive. Again this is advantageous in that it provides an alternate route to destruction if the caspase 3 pathway is compromised. Caspase 3-deficient mice demonstrate no defect in thymocyte apoptosis, suggesting that redundancy within the cell death cascade is crucial (39Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C-S. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Overall the activation of multiple caspases makes biological sense for an immune system that protects against a variety of pathogens. Numerous viral and oncogene products have been described that inhibit steps in the apoptotic program (25Macen J.L. Garner R.S. Musy P.-Y. Brooks M.A. Turner P.C. Moyer R.W. McFadden G. Bleackley R.C.

Chem. 1996; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (603) Google Scholar), allowing viruses, for example, to delay cell death so that viral replication can proceed unabated. By the activation of the caspase cascade at multiple levels, the granzyme B-dependent killing mechanism can overcome the inhibition mediated by viral proteins. The inherent plasticity in the granzyme death pathway is therefore vitally important for the survival of the host organism as a whole. The model must also be considered in the design of potential immunosuppressive drugs. It is unlikely that inhibitors of individual caspases or compounds that block activation of specific members by granzyme B would be useful. Rather, molecules that block the action of granzyme B on multiple substrates are much more likely to be effective. We are most grateful to Tracy Sawchuk for technical assistance, Vicki Luxton and Mae Wylie for their help in the preparation of the manuscript, M. Simon and T. Ley for providing granzyme A and B knockout mice, respectively, and D. Nicholson for his anti-caspase 3 antibody."

IKK proteins in the immune complexes were detected by immunoblotting. Endogenous IKK activity in Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-infected T cells was determined by a similar strategy but using anti-IKKα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in the immune precipitation. To determine whether the recently cloned IKKs are required for activation of NF-κB by Tax, we examined the effects of catalytically inactive forms of IKKα (IKKα(K44M)) and IKKβ (IKKβ(K44A)) (20DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 21Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar) on Tax-mediated transactivation of a κB-driven luciferase reporter gene (κB-TATA-luc). The κB-TATA-luc reporter gene was transfected into Jurkat T cells either alone or together with a Tax expression vector along with increasing amounts of IKKα(K44M) or IKKβ(K44A). As expected, Tax potently activated the κB enhancer, resulting in marked induction of luciferase activity (Fig. 1 A, column 2). More importantly, expression of increasing amounts of catalytically inactive IKKα or IKKβ led to a dose-dependent inhibition of reporter induction (columns 3–6). At the concentrations used, the inactive IKKs only modestly affected RelA-mediated κB-TATA-luc transactivation (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the IKKs appeared to be required for Tax-mediated NF-κB activation but not the nuclear function of NF-κB. Parallel experiments performed with the WT forms of IKKα and IKKβ revealed that IKKα potentiated Tax-mediated induction of κB-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C,columns 2–4). At low concentrations, IKKβ also significantly enhanced Tax-mediated transactivation (columns 5 and 6), although expression of higher amounts of IKKβ caused a reduction in reporter gene expression (column 7). At the amounts transfected, neither IKKα nor IKKβ significantly affected reporter expression in Tax's absence (columns 8 and 9). These results further suggested that these IκB kinases participate in Tax-mediated NF-κB activation. The different dose requirement for IKKα and IKKβ to potentiate Tax activity may be due to differential expression of the endogenous IKKs in Jurkat cells. However, it may also be due to their different properties (19Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 21Zandi E.

Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbose M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effect of the transdominant IKK mutants on Tax-mediated NF-κB activation was due to the inhibition of IκB phosphorylation, immunoblotting was used to examine phosphorylation of IκBα in transiently transfected cells. When coexpressed with IκBα, Tax induced the appearance of a slower migrating form of IκBα (Fig. 2,lane 2), which upon incubation with alkaline phosphatase regained faster electrophoretic mobility (data not shown). As demonstrated (29Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), this electrophoretic mobility change of IκBα resulted from its phosphorylation at serines 32 and 36, since mutation of these two serines within IκBα abolished this change (data not shown). We then examined the effect of the inactive IKKs on Tax-induced IκBα phosphorylation. Expression of either IKKα(K44M) or IKKβ(K44A) led to a dose-dependent inhibition of the Tax-induced appearance of the phosphorylated form of IκBα, IκBα-P (Fig. 2, lanes 3–9, middle panel). Under these conditions, the level of Tax expression was not significantly influenced (lower panel), suggesting that the dominant negative effect of the inactive IKKs was specifically on Tax-induced signal transductions. These findings strongly suggest that IKKα and IKKβ are key components of Tax-mediated induction of both IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent NF-κB activation. To examine whether Tax causes IKK activation, we transfected Jurkat T cells with cDNA expression vectors encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged IKKα or IKKβ in the presence or absence of the Tax expression vector. The transiently expressed IKKα and IKKβ were immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody, and their kinase activity was measured by an in vitro kinase assay (20DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 21Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar) using a substrate containing the N-terminal portion of IκBα fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-IκBα-(1–54)). When expressed alone, IKKα exhibited low basal kinase activity (Fig.3 A, lane 1, top). However, Tax coexpression led to marked enhancement in IKKα catalytic activity (lane 2,top). Additionally, Tax enhanced autophosphorylation of IKKα (lane 2, top). We similarly examined whether IKKβ also serves as a target of Tax. As previously reported (21Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar, 22Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbose M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar), IKKβ exhibited higher levels of basal kinase activity than IKKα (Fig. 3 A, lane 3,top). However, this isoform of IKK appeared to be less responsive to Tax than IKKα. Nevertheless, expression of Tax in the cells did result in significant enhancement of IKKβ catalytic activity (lane 4). To assess the physiologic relevance of our findings with transfected cells, we next examined whether IKKs are also activated in HTLV-I-infected human T cells. For these studies, we used cell lines from different stages of HTLV-I-induced transformation, including E55, N1185, N1186, HUT102, SLB-1, C8166, and MT-2. The E55, N1185, and N1186 cells are infected with HTLV-I but have not progressed to the IL-2-independent stage, and the growth of these cells requires IL-2 (40Cereseto A. Diella F. Mulloy J.C. Cara A. Michieli P. Grassmann R. Franchini G. Klotman M.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HUT102, SLB-1, C8166, and MT-2 cells are IL-2-independent HTLV-I-transformed T cells (36Salahuddin S.Z. Markham P. Wong-Staal F. Franchini G. Kalyanaraman V.S. Gallo R.C. Virology. 1983; 129: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 37Gazdar A.F. Carney D.N. Bunn P.A. Russell E.K. Jaffe G.P. Blood. 1980; 55: 409-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Miyoshi I.

Both the IL-2-dependent and IL-2-independent HTLV-I-infected cell lines express high levels of Tax, which is associated with constitutive NF-κB activation (26Sun S.-C. Elwood J. Béraud C. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7377-7384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lacoste J. Petropoulos L. Pépin N. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 564-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,33McKinsey T.A. Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. Al-Murrani S.W. Green P.L. Ballard W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2E. W. Harhaj and S. C. Sun, unpublished data. The C8166 cells are particularly interesting, since these cells carry a defective HTLV-I that selectively expresses Tax but not other viral proteins (36Salahuddin S.Z. Markham P. Wong-Staal F. Franchini G. Kalyanaraman V.S. Gallo R.C. Virology. 1983; 129: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To examine whether IKK was activated in these Tax-expressing cells, endogenous IKKα was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of protein extracts of either control Jurkat cells or the C8166 cells. In vitro KA revealed that while IKKα from Jurkat cells had no detectable kinase activity, IKKα isolated from C8166 cells exhibited substantial kinase activity (Fig. 3 B, middle) as well as autophosphorylation activity (top). The presence of constitutive IKKα kinase activity in C8166 cells was not due to an elevated IKKα expression. In fact, the C8166 IKKα immune complex contained significantly less IKKα than the Jurkat IKKα immune complex (Fig. 3 B, bottom). Interestingly, when C8166 cells were incubated with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, an alkylating agent that inhibits Tax-induced IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation (26Sun S.-C. Elwood J. Béraud C. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7377-7384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IKKα activity was largely abolished (lane 3, middle). Similar KA demonstrated that IKK was also constitutively activated in all of the other HTLV-I-infected cell lines (Fig. 3 C) and a T-cell clone expressing Tax in the context of a herpes saimiri vector (Fig.3 C, lane 2, Tax1; Ref. 6Grassmann R. Berchtold S. Radant I. Alt M. Fleckenstein B. Sodroski J.G. Gaseltine W.A. Ramstedt U. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4570-4575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting revealed that all of these Tax-expressing cell lines had a lower IKK protein level than the Jurkat cells (data not shown), suggesting that the IKK activity induction associated with Tax expression was due to activation of the kinase. To further confirm that constitutive IKK activation resulted from HTLV-I infection, we infected human peripheral blood T cells with HTLV-I in vitro and compared the IKKα activity between the uninfected and the bulk HTLV-I-infected T cells. As expected, the uninfected human T cells exhibited undetectable levels of IKKα activity, which was activated upon mitogen stimulation (Fig. 3 D, lanes 1 and 2). Remarkably, upon HTLV-I infection, the IKKα kinase activity was dramatically induced (lane 3). Together, these results demonstrate that Tax activates the IKKs in both Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-infected T cells. Prior studies led to identification of Tax mutants that are either defective or effective in NF-κB activation (49Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To correlate Tax-mediated activation of IKKα with induction of NF-κB, we examined the effect of two well characterized Tax mutants, M22 and M47, on IKKα activity. Consistent with its deficiency in NF-κB activation (49Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), M22 did not activate IKKα (Fig.4, lane 3). In contrast, M47, which is fully effective in NF-κB activation (49Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), significantly stimulated IKKα activity and autophosphorylation (lane 4). Of note, neither the autophosphorylation nor phosphorylation of IκBα-(1–54) was detected with a catalytically inactive IKKα mutant, IKKα(K44M), even when it was coexpressed with the wild type Tax (lane 5), suggesting the requirement of IKKα catalytic activity in these phosphorylation events. Furthermore, Tax-induced IKKα activity was specific for serine 32 and serine 36 of IκBα, since substitution of these two serines with alanines in the substrate abolished 32P incorporation (Fig. 4, lane 6, middle). Similar results were obtained with IKKβ, whose catalytic activity was enhanced by both WT Tax and TaxM47 but not influenced by TaxM22 (lanes 8–10). We noticed that TaxM47 consistently induced stronger IKK activity than WT Tax (compare the middle part of lanes 2 and 8 and lanes 4 and10). While the underlying mechanism remains to be further investigated, this result is consistent with the finding that M47 is a stronger NF-κB activator compared with WT Tax (49Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Parallel immunoblotting assays revealed that the kinase activity of IKKs was well correlated with phosphorylation of IκBα in intact cells, indicated by its retarded electrophoretic mobility (data not shown). Recent studies suggested that a MAP3K-related kinase, NIK, participates in NF-κB activation induced by cytokines (34Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). NIK was suggested to physically interact and activate the IKKs (18Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 19Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of NIK in Tax-mediated NF-κB signaling, we examined the effect of a catalytically inactive form of NIK (NIK(K429A/K430A)) (34Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar) on Tax-induced IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A). At moderate doses (0.2–0.5 μg), NIK(K429A/K430A) significantly inhibited Tax-induced generation of the slower migrating phosphorylated IκBα (IκBα-P) (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4). Reporter gene assays demonstrated that NIK(K429A/K430A) also inhibited Tax-mediated κB-TATA-luc activation (Fig. 5 B). Thus, NIK appears to play an important role in Tax-induced NF-κB activation. To further investigate the role of NIK in Tax-mediated NF-κB signaling, we analyzed the effect of WT NIK on Tax-induced IκBα phosphorylation. In 293 cells, Tax induced only a modest increase in IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 5 C, lane 2). As previously reported (19Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar), overexpression of IKKβ or IKKβ plus NIK produced certain levels of IκBα phosphorylation activity (data not shown). However, at lower levels, neither IKKβ alone nor IKKβ plus NIK induced IκBα phosphorylation (Fig.5 C, lanes 5 and 6). Furthermore, when coexpressed with Tax, IKKβ induced only weak IκBα phosphorylation (lane 4), suggesting the lack of additional factors. Interestingly, when Tax was cotransfected with both IKKβ and NIK, a markedly higher level of IκBα phosphorylation was detected (lane 8). Similar results were obtained with IKKα (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that Tax-induced IκBα phosphorylation involves both IKKs and NIK. We have shown that Tax activation of NF-κB is mediated by an indirect mechanism, which requires cellular signaling machinery. This mechanism differs from the one that mediates Tax activation of the CREB/ATF factors, which involves direct interaction between Tax and these basic leucine zipper-containing cellular DNA binding proteins (13Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 14Baranger A.M. Palmer R.C. Hamm M.K. Giebler H.A. Brauweller A. Nyborg J.K. Schepartz A. Nature. 1995; 376: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 15Perini G. Wagner S. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that the recently cloned IκB kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, are among the cellular signaling molecules participating in Tax-induced NF-κB activation. Catalytically inactive IKKs interfere with both the phosphorylation of IκBα and subsequent NF-κB activation induced by Tax (Figs. 1 and 2). Consistently, Tax triggers the activation of both IKKα and IKKβ, and this is tightly associated with the site-specific phosphorylation of IκBα in intact cells. The importance of IKK for Tax-mediated NF-κB induction is further supported by experiments performed with Tax mutants. A mutant form of Tax (M22), defective in NF-κB activation, is unable to trigger IKK activation. On the other hand, M47, which harbors a mutation selectively affecting the CREB/ATF pathway, is fully active upon IKK activation (Fig. 4). Thus, Tax-mediated IKK activation is well correlated with its ability to activate NF-κB. Notably, IKK activation occurs not only in Tax-transfected cells but also in various HTLV-I-infected human T-cell lines as well as in human peripheral blood T cells freshly infected with HTLV-I (Fig. 3), thus confirming the physiological relevance of our findings. Our findings support the previous reports that Tax may induce the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBs (26Sun S.-C. Elwood J. Béraud C. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7377-7384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kanno T. Brown K. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6443-6451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lacoste J. Petropoulos L.

We believe that this is a major pathway by which Tax activates NF-κB. Tax has also been suggested to directly bind to NF-κB proteins and enhance their transactivation function in the nucleus (50Suzuki T. Hirai H. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3099-3105PubMed Google Scholar). Although this proposal does not explain how Tax induces the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, such a mechanism may exist to amplify the cytoplasmic action of Tax, i.e. activation of IKKs and induction of NF-κB nuclear expression. We have noticed that the catalytically inactive IKKs and NIK have more dramatic inhibitory effects on Tax-induced IκBα phosphorylation (Figs. 2 and5 A) than on Tax-mediated κB reporter activation (Figs.1 A and 5 B). Although this difference could be due to the higher sensitivity of the luciferase assay compared with immunoblotting, it may also suggest that Tax has a direct transactivation function in the nucleus. Nevertheless, our results indicate that activation of IKKs plays a central and critical role in Tax-induced nuclear expression of NF-κB in both Tax-transfected and HTLV-I-infected T cells. The mechanism by which Tax affects IKK activity remains to be further investigated. However, it appears that IKKs are not the sole target for Tax. The dominant-negative inhibition assays suggest that NIK is involved in Tax-induced IKK signaling functions. Recent studies suggest that NIK serves as an upstream kinase involved in IKK activation (18Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar,19Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V.

A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). NIK physically interacts with IKKs and stimulates their kinase activity when these proteins are overexpressed together in 293 cells (19Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). It remains to be tested whether Tax enhances or stabilizes the interaction between NIK and IKKs. Nevertheless, the ability of Tax to induce sustained IKK activation clearly explains the basis for constitutive IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation in Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-infected T cells. Given the critical role of NF-κB in cell growth and survival (53Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 54Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), the activation of these IκB kinases may be an important mechanism by which HTLV-I transforms host cells. As such, Tax provides a useful model for how a retroviral regulatory protein transforms host cells by targeting cellular signal transduction pathways. During the revision of this paper, similar findings were reported by Yin et al. (58Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbose M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, unlike our study, this report suggests that IKKβ, but not IKKα, is required for Tax activation of NF-κB. This discrepancy is likely due to the different experimental strategies and conditions used in these two studies. For example, Yinet al. used HIV-1 LTR, instead of the κB enhancer, as an NF-κB reporter. Since the HIV-1 LTR also contains other enhancers, such as NF-AT, which may respond to Tax (59Good L Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the result obtained with this reporter may not exactly reflect the activity of NF-κB. Nevertheless, we have performed both reporter gene assays (using the κB reporter, Fig. 1) and in vivo and in vitroIκBα phosphorylation assays (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4), which clearly demonstrate that both IKKα and IKKβ are involved in Tax activation of NF-κB. We thank W. C. Greene and D. Wallach for cDNA expression vectors, R.

Common features in this family include the presence of N-terminal G1 and C-terminal G3 domains, and a large chondroitin sulfate side chain-bearing sequence localized in the middle region.

As a result of alternative splicing, the protein has many isoforms, which may express different functions.

It has been reported that versican interferes with the attachment of cells to various extracellular matrix components such as collagen I, fibronectin, and laminin (11Yamagata M. Suzuki S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8012-8018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits cell adhesion (12Yamagata M. Saga S. Kato M. Bernfield M. Kimata K. J.

It may also be involved in the formation of tissues that act as barriers to migratory neural crest cells and outgrowing axons during embryonic development (14Landolt R.M. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H.

Since versican is highly expressed in fast growing tissues and cells, it has been suggested that versican plays a role in cell proliferation. Using molecular biological techniques, we show in this report that the expression of a truncated versican gene, or exogenous addition of a truncated versican gene product, promotes cell proliferation. Expression of the versican G3 domain alone achieves the same effect, but deletion of the EGF-like motifs greatly reduces the ability of versican to stimulate growth. Antisense oligonucleotides to EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibited cell proliferation, and the effect was greater in the recombinant versican-transfected cell line than in the vector-transfected cell line. These results suggest that the EGF-like motifs in versican G3 domain may promote cell proliferation through a direct or indirect interaction with EGFR.

All other chemicals were from Sigma. Four-day old chicken embryos (products of Hamburger and Hamilton strains and purchased from Brampton Chick Hatchery Co. Ltd., Brampton, Ontario, Canada) were used to isolate mesenchymal cells from limb buds. To construct a recombinant versican gene, the G1 domain, 15% of the CS domain, and the G3 domain were individually cloned into pUC19. Briefly, a HindIII site and an MluI site were added at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the G1 domain using G1NHindIII (AAA AAG CTT GCC GCC ACC ATG TTG TTA AAC ATA AAA AGC) and G1CMluI (AAA ACG CGT TTC GTA GCA GTA GGC ATC AAA) as primers in a reverse transcription-PCR reaction. These primers were used to amplify nucleotides 145–1182 in the versican cDNA sequence published by Shinomura et al. (1Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from the sterna of 14-day-old-chicken embryos and used as template for reverse transcription-PCR. The PCR product was purified from agarose gel following electrophoresis using the Prep-A-Gene kit. This generated a cDNA of 1038 base pairs corresponding to the G1 domain of the published sequence (nucleotides 145–1182) (1Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G3 fragment was prepared in a similar manner: the restriction sites for XhoI and SphI were created using primers G3NXhoI (5′-AAA CTC GAG GGA CAG GAT CCA TGC AAA AGT) and G3CSphI (5′-AAA GCA TGC GCG CCT TGA GTC CTG CCA CGT). These primers are located in the nucleotide sequences 9904–9924 and 10810–10830 and amplify a 927-base pair cDNA corresponding to the G3 domain of versican (1Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To clone a section of the CS sequence, chicken genomic DNA was used as template since the CS sequence is in a large exon. CSNMluI (5′-AAA ACG CGT C1183 GT AAA AAA ATT GTA TCA GAG) and CNCXhoI (5′-AAA CTC GAG A2424CT CAT TTC TGG CTC CTT TGT) were used as primers to create MluI andXhoI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the CS sequence. These primers generate a cDNA of 1242 base pairs, containing nucleotides 1183–2424 of versican. This represents the portion of the CS sequence immediately 3′ of the G1 domain, and contains a high proportion of potential sites for glycosaminoglycan chain attachment. We chose not to clone the whole 8-kilobase pair CS sequence because we are primarily interested in studying the functions of the G1 and G3 domains. All constructs obtained by PCR in the study were sequenced to confirm their identity. Finally, the three DNA fragments prepared above were ligated together, as shown in Fig. 1 A, into pcDNA1 (Invitrogen). The recombinant versican gene (G1CSG3) was 3.2 kilobase pairs, and was expected to yield a core protein of 150 kDa. With the attachment of glycosaminoglycan chains, we expected that the recombinant proteoglycan would migrate on SDS-PAGE gel as a smear, at around 200 kDa or higher. In generating the G3 construct, the leading peptide of link protein (nucleotides 1–180) (23Deák F. Kiss I. Sparks K.J. Argraves W.S. Hampikian G. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3766-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was joined with the versican G3 domain in order to allow secretion of the G3 gene product. The leading peptide of link protein was amplified with the primers 5′-AAA GAA TTC GCC GCC ACC ATG GCA AGT CTA CTC TTT CTG and 5′-AAA CTC GAG AGG CAG TGT GAC GTT GCC in a PCR reaction. The PCR product was purified and digested withEcoRI and XhoI. The G3 domain was derived from the G1CSG3 construct using the restriction enzymes XhoI andSphI. The G3 fragment and link protein leading peptide were ligated into the pcDNA1 vector digested with EcoRI andSphI. As well, a MRGS⋅His (Qiagen) epitope (MRGSHHHHHH) was generated at the C terminus of the G3 construct for staining and purification with the monoclonal antibodyMRGS⋅His. This was obtained using a primer (AAA TCT AGA GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG AGA TCC TCT CAT TGA GTC CTG CCA CGT CCT) (1Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is complementary to the 3′ end of the G3 domain and contains a sequence encoding the MRGS⋅His epitope, and a second primer located in the 5′ terminus of the G3 domain, in a PCR reaction. The reaction generated the G3 construct containing theMRGS⋅His epitope. The G1CS construct shown in Fig. 1 A was generated by insertion of the link protein leading peptide and G1CS sequence between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA1. The leading peptide contains an EcoRI site at its 5′ end and aBamHI site at its 3′ end, while the G1CS sequence contains aBamHI site at its 5′ end (nucleotides 244–249) (1Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and aXhoI site at its 3′ end created as described above. To delete the EGF-like motifs from the G3 domain of versican, a site for the restriction enzyme XhoI was engineered at the 5′ end of the CRD. This was performed by using CRDNXhoI (AAA CTC GAG C10129AA GAC ACA GAG ACT) and G3CSphI (5′-AAA GCA TGC G10830CG CCT TGA GTC CTG CCA CGT) as primers in a PCR reaction. The product, a G3 fragment lacking the EGF-like motifs (G3ΔEGF), was digested with XhoI andSphI and ligated into the recombinant mini-versican from which the full-length G3 domain had been removed by digestion withXhoI and SphI. The pcDNA1-G1CSG3 construct (mini-versican) was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as originally described by Felgneret al. (24Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4388) Google Scholar). Growth medium and cells were harvested separately after 3 days of transfection. Expression of genes was analyzed by Western blot, using anti-G3 antibody, as described below. We confirmed that glycosaminoglycan chains were attached to the expressed core protein, resulting in a characteristic proteoglycan smear on SDS-PAGE and Western blot, and also that gene products were secreted and present in the growth medium. Once we had verified that the transiently-expressed products were properly processed and secreted, the mini-versican construct was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and stable transfection of NIH3T3 cells was performed. Three days after transfection, Geneticin was added to the growth medium at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the cells were maintained in this medium until individual colonies were large enough for cloning. Chemically selected cell lines were maintained in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin or stored in liquid nitrogen. PCR technique was used to confirm that the selected cell lines had incorporated the genes of interest. Briefly, genomic DNA was prepared from cell lysate (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 14.1-14.30Google Scholar) and used as template in a PCR reaction with primers (5′-GAG CAA GAC ACA GAG ACT and 5′-GCG CCT TGA GTC CTG CCA) which amplify nucleotides 10125–10830 of chicken versican (1Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of recombinant proteoglycans was performed in SDS-PAGE-Western blot assay. Cell lysate and growth medium that contained recombinant gene products were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The stacking gel contained 4% polyacrylamide. A 5% separating gel was used for the mini-versican product and a 12% separating gel for the G3 domain. The buffer system is 1x TG (Tris-glycine buffer, Amresco product) containing 1% SDS. Proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) in 1x TG buffer containing 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10% non-fat dry milk powder (TBSTM) for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-G3 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) in TBSTM. The membranes were washed with TBST (three times for 30 min each) and then incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in TBSTM. After washing as above, the bound antibody was visualized with an ECL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham). Electrophoresis of endogenous versican was performed in agarose gel (agarose-Western blot assay). The agarose gel (4-cm height containing 1.5% agarose in a barbital buffer containing 0.124 mTris-Cl, 27 mm barbituric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.7) was made on top of a 1-cm conventional 10% polyacrylamide gel. The polyacrylamide gel was used only to seal the bottom of the casting stand and acted as a base for the agarose separating gel. The barbital buffer was also used as a running buffer and the electrophoresis took place at 40 V for 5 h at room temperature. Molecules, up to 2 million Da in size (blue dextran 2000), are able to enter the agarose gel. Growth media from chicken mesenchymal culture and NIH3T3 fibroblast culture of equal protein concentrations were analyzed in the gel. To allow transfer of such large molecules onto the nitrocellulose membrane, the blotting took place in TG buffer at 20 V overnight at 4 °C. The rest of the procedure was similar to the Western blot protocol described above. The conditioned medium collected from the mini-versican-transfected cells was dialyzed overnight against 10 volumes of reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm sodium acetate). After a buffer change, the mixture was further dialyzed for 1 h. Meanwhile, chondroitinase ABC (Sigma, catalog no. C2905) was dissolved in the reaction buffer at a concentration of 1.33 units/ml. This enzyme was added to the dialyzed versican solution (1:1), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight to digest the glycosaminoglycan chains. In some samples, chondroitinase ABC was replaced by hyaluronidase, which was used as a control. The enzyme-digested products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed on Western blot. Strategy for insertion of the G3 domain into pQE30 (Qiagen Inc., catalog no. 32149) is shown in Fig. 1 A. pQE30, a bacterial expression vector, contains an epitope (MRGSHHHHHH) at its amino terminus recognized by the monoclonal antibody anti-MRGS⋅His. The six histidines in this epitope bind nickel and allow purification of fusion proteins on a Ni-NTA affinity column. The epitope is followed by multiple cloning sites. The G3 domain of the recombinant versican was ligated into the first cloning site, BamHI, producing an epitope-tagged G3 gene product. The G3 domain was generated using two primers G3NBamHI (AAA GGA TCC GGA CAG GAT CCA TGC AAA) and G3CSphI (as above) in a PCR reaction, as above, and ligated into the bacterial expression vector pQE30. The resulting construct contained an N-terminal MRGS⋅His tag and was expressed in Escherichia coli strain M15. Gene products produced by bacteria were purified on a Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen, catalog no. 30230) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To eliminate trace amounts of contamination that may occur during column purification, the column-purified product was subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE. To produce polyclonal anti-G3 antibody, adult New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with the SDS-PAGE purified G3 domain peptide, according to methods previously described (26Yang B. LéJohn H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4506-4512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antiserum obtained was used to monitor the expression of the recombinant genes on Western blot. 1 × 104 fibroblasts were seeded into each well of 24-well plates and cultured with standard medium (DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum). Cell numbers were determined at day 1, 2, and 3 using a cytometer. In the chicken fibroblast proliferation assay, the fibroblasts were isolated from 14-day-old chicken embryos. Chicken skin was removed and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. The skin was then cut into pieces and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in dissociation medium containing 0.1% trypsin and 0.3% collagenase (Sigma, catalog no. C-6885) dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution. The dissociation medium was changed, and the tissue was incubated for a further 2 h. An equal volume of growth medium was added to stop the enzyme reaction. Cells were collected by passing the mixture through a filter (70-μm nylon) and centrifuging the filtrate at 1100 rpm. The cells were then resuspended in growth medium and plated in tissue culture dishes. The cells could be used for assay after 1 week of culture. Proliferation of chicken fibroblasts was assayed by counting as above. Flow cytometry of labeled DNA was used to analyze cell cycles. The mini-versican-transfected and vector-transfected stable cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum for 1–3 days. Cells were harvested with 10 mm EDTA dissolved in DMEM and collected by centrifugation at 200 × g. The cell pellets were resuspended gently in 1 ml of hypotonic propidium iodide (Sigma) solution (50 μg/ml) prepared in 0.1% sodium citrate plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for DNA staining. The samples were analyzed with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) as described previously (27Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). To study the effect of G3 gene products on cell proliferation, G3 was purified from the G3-transfected COS-7 cells and G3-expressing bacteria. Briefly, conditioned medium from COS-7 cells that had been transfected with G3 construct, and cell lysate from G3-transformed bacteria, were dialyzed against equilibration buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole). This buffer was also used to equilibrate a Ni-NTA column. The dialyzed samples were incubated with the Ni-NTA column and washed extensively with washing buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). G3 peptide was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). The volume of elution buffer used in each sample was the same as the volume of the original cultures. The purified products were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and then analyzed on SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue dye or silver staining. Purification of the mini-versican products obtained from mini-versican-transfected COS-7 cells was performed as above. Lysate from vector-transfected COS-7 cells was subjected to the same purification procedure to serve as a control in order to estimate the effect of any contaminants that were bound to the column and eluted by the elution buffer. The elution buffer containing purified mini-versican and the control elution buffer were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline overnight with two changes of phosphate-buffered saline. To evaluate the concentration of gene product in the growth media, both Western blot and ELISA were used. Purified link protein was used as a standard in Western blots. Link protein contains an epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody (4B6) (28Binette F. Cravens J. Kahoussi B. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19116-19122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in its leading peptide, and we added this leading peptide to the G3 construct. This served a dual purpose; it allowed secretion of the G3 gene product and allowed detection by the 4B6 antibody. We transiently transfected COS-7 cells with the G3 construct and the control vector alone in order to produce the G3 gene product. Expression of the G3 construct was demonstrated with Western blot assay, using cell growth medium. Briefly, 10 μl of G3-containing growth medium were run on SDS-PAGE alongside a series of link protein dilutions (1–20 ng), electrotransferred, and probed with the 4B6 antibody. Since the antibody recognizes both link protein and the G3 construct product with the same affinity, and since both link protein and G3 proteins are approximately the same size, similar protein concentrations would produce similar band intensities after ECL development. This technique provides a reasonable estimate of gene product concentration. For evaluation of the concentration of versican in growth medium, Western blot was not appropriate because versican migrates as a smear in SDS-PAGE, making determination of band density difficult. The ELISA assay provided a useful means of evaluating versican's concentration. In ELISA, growth medium (100 μl) from vector- and recombinant versican-transfected chicken fibroblasts was coated onto each well of a 96-well plate and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The medium was then removed and the plate was blocked with TBSTM (200 μl/well) at room temperature for 1 h. Washes and incubation with primary and secondary antibody were similar to Western blot assay. The primary antibody was rabbit anti-G3 antibody, and the secondary antibody was peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. TMB (Amersham, code RPN 2718) was used for color development. Optical density was determined using an ELISA reader set to 570 nm according to the manufacturer's instructions. The optical density value in the medium from the vector-transfected cells was assigned a value of 100%. To test the possible role of the EGFR in versican's effects on cell proliferation, 200 μl of NIH3T3 fibroblast suspension at a concentration of 3 × 104cells/ml were inoculated into each well of 96-well tissue culture plates followed by addition of 50 μl of purified mini-versican solution at an estimated concentration of approximately 0.4 ng/μl. The control solution obtained from the purification was used as a negative control. Human EGF (Sigma, catalog no. E-9644) at a final concentration of 15 ng/well was used as a positive control. As well, 15 μl of sense (ATG CGA CCC TCA GGG ACC GCG, located in the 5′ end of the coding sequence of EGFR) (29Luetteke N.C. Phillips H.K. Qiu T.H. Copeland N.G. Earp H.S. Jenkins N.A. Lee D.C. Genes Devel. 1994; 8: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) or antisense (antisense 1, CGC GGT CCC TGA GGG TCG CAT, 5′ end of EGFR; and antisense 2, TGC TCC AAT AAA CTC ACT GCT, 3′ end of EGFR) oligonucleotides were added to the cultures at a final concentration of 3.2 μm. Cells without oligonucleotide treatment served as controls. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator. After 3 days, the fibroblasts were harvested by incubating the cells with 10 mm EDTA for 10 min. Cell number was determined by cell counting as described above. Each treatment was done in quadruplicate and analyzed statistically. The mini-versican gene, containing the G1 domain, a portion of the central sequence, and the G3 domain, was constructed (Fig. 1 A) in pcDNA1"
https://openalex.org/W1972864808,"Previous studies in parathyroid cells, which express the G protein-coupled, extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), showed that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) blunts high extracellular calcium (Ca2+o)-evoked stimulation of phospholipase C and the associated increases in cytosolic calcium (Ca2+i), suggesting that PKC may directly modulate the coupling of the CaR to intracellular signaling systems. In this study, we examined the role of PKC in regulating the coupling of the CaR to Ca2+i dynamics in fura-2-loaded human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cells) transiently transfected with the human parathyroid CaR. We demonstrate that several PKC activators exert inhibitory effects on CaR-mediated increases in Ca2+i due to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Consistent with the effect being mediated by activation of PKC, the inhibitory effect of PKC activators on Ca2+ release can be blocked by a PKC inhibitor. The use of site-directed mutagenesis reveals that threonine at amino acid position 888 is the major PKC site that mediates the inhibitory effect of PKC activators on Ca2+ mobilization. The effect of PKC activation can be maximally blocked by mutating three PKC sites (Thr888, Ser895, and Ser915) or all five PKC sites. In vitro phosphorylation shows that Thr888 is readily phosphorylated by PKC. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of the CaR is the molecular basis for the previously described effect of PKC activation on Ca2+o-evoked changes in Ca2+idynamics in parathyroid cells. Previous studies in parathyroid cells, which express the G protein-coupled, extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), showed that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) blunts high extracellular calcium (Ca2+o)-evoked stimulation of phospholipase C and the associated increases in cytosolic calcium (Ca2+i), suggesting that PKC may directly modulate the coupling of the CaR to intracellular signaling systems.

The extracellular calcium concentration (Ca2+o) is tightly regulated by the interactions of several hormones (e.g. parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1The abbreviations used are: PTHparathyroid hormoneCaRextracellular calcium-sensing receptorPKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol myristate acetatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidbpbase pairsCa2+ oextracellular calcium. vitamin D, and calcitonin) and organ systems (i.e. parathyroid gland, kidney, bone, and intestine) (1Brown E.M.

The CaR was first isolated from bovine parathyroid cells using expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes and shows pharmacological properties nearly identical to those of the native receptor in its responses to agonists such as extracellular divalent cations (e.g. Ca2+o and Mg2+o), trivalent cations (e.g.Gd3+o) and polyamines (e.g. neomycin) (2Brown E.M.

In response to increases in Ca2+o, the CaR stimulates accumulation of inositol phosphates and produces transient followed by sustained increases in Ca2+i. Subsequently, cDNAs encoding the human homologue of the same receptor have been cloned from parathyroid (3Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C.P. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F.

Akerstrom G. Gylfe E. Acta Endocrinol. 1992; 126: 505-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although there is also reduced expression of the CaR in these glands (16Gogusev J. Duchambon P. Hory B.

Kifor I. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, PKC may contribute to age-related changes in the regulation of PTH secretion by Ca2+o in rats (18Wongsurawat N. Armbrecht H.J. Exp. Gerontol. 1987; 22: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, stimulus-secretion coupling in parathyroid cells can be modulated by PKC, perhaps at an early step in the process of Ca2+o sensing. The human homologue of the CaR is predicted to have five PKC sites in its intracellular domains. We hypothesized that PKC modulates the sensitivity of parathyroid cells to changes in Ca2+o by covalently modifying these sites. To test this hypothesis, we have transiently transfected a human parathyroid CaR cDNA (18Wongsurawat N. Armbrecht H.J. Exp. Gerontol. 1987; 22: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in HEK293 cells and mutated each of the five putative PKC sites individually or in varying combinations in the CaR. We studied Ca2+i responses of the wild type and mutant CaRs to elevations in Ca2+o and the polycationic CaR agonist, neomycin, in the presence or absence of various PKC activators (e.g. phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), Mezerein, and (−)-Indolactam V) and/or the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine. Our results show that phosphorylation by PKC at one of the five predicted PKC phosphorylation sites (Thr888) substantially reduces CaR-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Therefore, it is possible that PKC phosphorylation of the CaR regulates PTH secretion by inhibiting Ca2+ mobilization or perhaps generation of some other intracellular mediator(s) along the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the approach described by Kunkel (19Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) to produce mutated receptors in which one or more serine or threonine residues present in the five predicted PKC phosphorylation sites within intracellular domains of the human CaR were mutated to alanine or valine, respectively. The dut-1 ung-1 strain of Escherichia coli, CJ236, was transformed separately with mutagenesis cassette 5 or 6, as described previously (20Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). For two receptors with two mutations each (T888V/S895A and T888V/S915A) and one with three mutations (T888V/S895A/S915A), CJ236 cells were separately transformed with a mutated cassette 6 carrying a single mutation (S895A or T888V) or two mutations (T888V/S915A). Uracil-containing, single-stranded DNA was produced by infecting the cells with the helper phage, VCSM13 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The single-stranded DNA was then annealed to a mutagenesis primer that contained the desired nucleotide change encoding a single point mutation flanked on both sides by wild type sequences. The primer was subsequently extended around the entire single-stranded DNA and ligated to generate closed circular heteroduplex DNA. DH5α competent cells were transformed with these DNA heteroduplexes, and incorporation of the desired mutations was confirmed by sequencing the entire cassettes. The resultant mutated cassette 5 was doubly digested with HpaI and XhoI and cloned into the reconstructed receptor in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), as described previously (20Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Likewise, mutated versions of cassette 6 containing the desired mutations were doubly digested withXhoI and XbaI and cloned into the reconstructed receptor in pcDNA3. Cassette 6 was doubly digested with XhoI and HhaI, and the same cassette carrying three mutated PKC sites was doubly digested with HhaI and XbaI. Two small fragments (404 and 568 bp) obtained from the above digestions were ligated to the large fragment resulting from digestion of the parent reconstructed CaR clone with XhoI andXbaI. The resultant clone was confirmed by sequencing. The mutant receptor carrying T646V was doubly digested with HpaI and XhoI, and the mutant receptor carrying S794A was doubly digested with XhoI andXbaI. The two fragments (420 and 975 bp) obtained form the above digestions were ligated to the large fragment resulting from digestion of the wild type CaR in pcDNA3 with HpaI andXbaI. The resultant clone was confirmed by sequencing to carry these two mutations. Cassette 6 carrying S794A was doubly digested withXhoI and SphI, and the same cassette carrying three mutations was doubly digested with SphI andXbaI. Two fragments (168 and 795 bp) obtained from the above digestions were ligated to the large fragment resulting from digestion of the CaR carrying the single mutation, T646V, with XhoI and XbaI. The resultant clone was confirmed by sequencing to carry all five mutations. The receptors carrying five mutated PKC sites and two mutated sites (S895A/S915A) was doubly digested with KpnI andXbaI to obtain the full-length CaR inserts, which were further digested with SphI. One fragment (2434 bp) containing T646V/S794A and another fragment (803 bp) containing S895A/S915A, obtained from the above digestions, were ligated to pcDNA3 generated by KpnI and XbaI. The resultant clone was confirmed by sequencing to carry four mutations. The Flag, an epitope tag, was introduced into the third cassette of the wild type CaR as described previously (21Bai M. Janicic N. Trivedi S. Quinn S.J. Cole D.E.C. Brown E.M. Hendy G.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The third cassette containing Flag was digested with AflII and NheI and ligated to the large fragments resulting from digestion of the CaRs containing PKC site mutations. CaR cDNAs were prepared using the Midi Plasmid Kit (Qiagen). LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was employed as a DNA carrier for transfection (22Hawley-Nelson P. Ciccarone V. Gebeyehu G. Jessee J. Felgner P.L. Focus. 1993; 15: 73-79Google Scholar). The HEK293 cells used for transient transfection were provided by NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT) and were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The DNA-liposome complex was prepared by mixing DNA and LipofectAMINE in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubating the mixture at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-LipofectAMINE mixture was then diluted with Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium and added to 90% confluent HEK293 cells plated on 13.5 × 20.1-mm glass coverslips using 0.625 μg of DNA (for measurement of Ca2+i) or in 100 mm Petri dishes using 3.75 μg of DNA (for obtaining protein for Western analysis). After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, equivalent amounts of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium with 20% fetal bovine serum were added to the medium overlying the transfected cells, and the latter was replaced with fresh DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 24 h after transfection. The expressed Ca2+o-sensing receptor protein was assayed 48 h after the start of transfection. HEK293 cells, which were plated on coverslips and transfected with CaR cDNAs, were loaded for 2 h at room temperature with fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mmKCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% dextrose and washed once at 37 °C for 20–30 min with a buffer solution (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mm NaCl, 4 mmKCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% dextrose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The coverslips were then placed diagonally in a thermostatted quartz cuvette containing the buffer solution, using a modification of the technique employed previously in this laboratory (23Fajtova V.T. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E151-E158PubMed Google Scholar). The CaR was activated by multiple additions of an agonist in incremental doses to reach the desired concentrations. Excitation monochrometers were centered at 340 and 380 nm with emission light collected at 510 ± 40 nm through a wide-band emission filter. The ratio of emitted light (340/380 excitation) was used as readout for Ca2+ias described previously (23Fajtova V.T. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E151-E158PubMed Google Scholar). For PKC activation, the cells were preincubated with the PKC activators (PMA, mezerein, or (−)-indolactam V) for 1–2 min. For PKC inhibition, the cells were preincubated with staurosporine for 30 min. To measure transient Ca2+i responses elicited by neomycin, the buffer solution was devoid of MgCl2, CaCl2, and bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EGTA was added at the beginning of the experiment. To evaluate the activities of the wild type and mutant receptors, the cumulative Ca2+i response at a given concentration of the agonist was determined using the following method. If the peak increases in Ca2+i are P1,P2, P3 … Pn at concentrations of the agonist in the bath solution corresponding to C1,C2, C3 … Cn, which were achieved by incremental additions of the agonist, the cumulative Ca2+i response (Rn) at any given agonist concentration (Cn) is defined as the sum, P1 +P2 + P3+ … +Pn. The responsiveness of the wild type and mutant receptors to agonists were compared by determining both EC50 values and the maximal responses of the respective CaRs. EC50 has been defined as the effective concentration of an agonist giving half of the maximal Ca2+i response and was determined by plotting the concentration-response curve. The cumulative maximal Ca2+i response has been defined as the cumulative Ca2+i response at the highest agonist concentration achieved by the last addition. The mean EC50 for the wild type or each mutant receptor in response to increasing concentrations of Ca2+o or other CaR agonists was calculated from the EC50 values for all of the individual experiments and is expressed with the S.E. as the index of dispersion. Comparisons of the EC50 values were performed using analysis of variance or Duncan's multiple comparison test (24Duncan D.B. Biometrics. 1955; 11: 1-42Crossref Google Scholar). A p value of ≤0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Crude plasma membranes were isolated from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the wild type or mutant receptors by differential speed centrifugation as described by Sun et al. (25Sun G.Y. Huang H.-M. Kelleher J.A. Stubbs E.B.J. Sun A.Y. Neurochem. Int. 1988; 12: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Confluent cultured cells in 100-mm culture plates were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 5 min. The detached cells were pelleted and suspended in 300 μl of homogenization buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.32 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (83 μg/ml aprotinin, 30 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc, 50 μg/ml calpain inhibitor, 50 μg/ml bestatin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin (Boehringer Mannheim)). Then the cells were homogenized with 15 strokes of a motor-driven Teflon pestle in a tightly fitting glass tube. The homogenate was sedimented at 18,800 × g for 20 min to remove nuclei and mitochondria. The supernatant was subsequently sedimented at 43,500 × g for 20 min to pellet the plasma membranes, and the resultant pellet was solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. After determination of protein concentrations in the crude plasma membrane preparations using the Pierce BCA protein assay, an appropriate amount of membrane protein (4 μg) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227(259): 680-685Crossref Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The proteins on the gel were subsequently electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After being blocked with 5% milk, the blot was incubated with a previously characterized primary anti-CaR antibody (4641) (20Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and then with a secondary, goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, diluted 1:500). The Ca2+o-sensing receptor protein was detected with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK293 cells transiently transfected with receptors were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors, including 83 μg/ml aprotinin, 30 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc, 50 μg/ml calpain inhibitor, 50 μg/ml bestatin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin (1× immunoprecipitation buffer), at room temperature. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifuging the cell lysates at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as total cell lysates. The protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay. To a microcentrifuge tube, 5 μg of monoclonal anti-Flag M2 antibody (VWR Scientific), 400 μl of H2O, 500 μl of 2× immunoprecipitation buffer, and 100 μl of total lysate containing 500 μg of protein were added. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. To the mixture was added 5 μl of an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, anti-mouse IgG. The incubation was continued for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. To the mixture was then added 50 μl of 10% protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) for an additional 3-h incubation at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1× immunoprecipitation buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors as described above. After one additional wash with 50 μl of PKC assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmCaCl2) purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, the samples were ready for in vitro phosphorylation. The samples were phosphorylated with 80 ng of PKC (Upstate Biotechnology) in 50 μl of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, containing 25 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 μm (20 μCi) [γ-32P]ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.01 mg/ml diglyceride, 0.4 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 4 μm compound R24571 (an inhibitor for calmodulin-dependent kinases). The samples were incubated for 10 min at 32 °C and washed three times with a washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100). The pellet was extracted with 45 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer at 65 °C for 30 min. One-third of the eluted sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylated protein bands were visualized by autoradiography. The CaR immunoreactivities in the samples were determined by Western analysis. To examine the effects of PKC activators on the CaR, transiently transfected HEK293 cells were treated for 1–3 min with the vehicle (Me2SO), PKC activators (PMA, mezerein, or (−)-indolactam V), or an inactive phorbol analogue (4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, used as a negative control) prior to activation of the CaR by elevating Ca2+o. The activity of the receptor was evaluated by measuring EC50 and maximal cumulative response (see under “Experimental Procedures” for definition). Cells treated with Me2SO or 1 μm inactive phorbol derivative responded to increasing concentrations of Ca2+o in a manner similar to untreated cells, with EC50[Ca2+o] values of 4.1 ± 0.1 (n = 7), 4.0 ± 0.1 (n = 8), and 4.0 ± 0.1 (n = 34) mm, respectively, without significant differences (p ≤ 0.05). A representative tracing of the control Ca2+iresponses is shown in Fig. 1 A. In cells treated with 100 nm PMA, the Ca2+i responses at low Ca2+oconcentrations (1.5–4.5 mm) were markedly attenuated (Fig.1 B). At higher concentrations of Ca2+o(5.5 mm and above), however, the Ca2+o-elicited increases in Ca2+i were similar to those of control cells. As a result, the cumulative maximal Ca2+i response to elevated Ca2+o was reduced to 41% of the control by PMA, with a significant increase in EC50[Ca2+o] to 5.0 ± 0.1 mm (n = 25) (p ≤ 0.05). Additional, structurally unrelated PKC activators, such as 1 μm mezerein and 500 nm (−)-indolactam V had essentially identical inhibitory effects on CaR-elicited Ca2+i responses (Fig.2).Figure 2Inhibitory effects of structurally unrelated PKC activators on Ca2+o-elicited Ca2+i responses of the CaR. HEK293 cells were transfected with the CaR and loaded with fura-2. Changes in the emission ratio (340/380 excitation) were measured to assess Ca2+o-evoked Ca2+i responses. Prior to additions of Ca2+o, the cells were treated or not treated with one of the PKC activators, PMA, Mezerein, or (−)-Indolactam V. Responses are normalized to the maximal cumulative Ca2+i responses of nontreated cells. Eachpoint is the mean value of the number of measurements indicated in parentheses.

The CaR was activated by neomycin in the absence of Ca2+o and Mg2+o, as well as in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. Therefore, the neomycin-elicited Ca2+i responses in cells transfected with the CaR (Fig. 1 C) were solely the result of release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and these responses were not present in cells mock-transfected with vector alone (data not shown). Neomycin-elicited Ca2+i responses were substantially attenuated by pretreatment with PMA (1 μm) (Fig. 1 D) at all concentrations of neomycin tested, and the maximal cumulative Ca2+iresponse was reduced to 25% of the control. PMA treatment increased the EC50[neomycin] of the CaR from 298 ± 9 μm (n = 8) to 405 ± 22 μm (n = 8). The marked difference in the maximal cumulative responses in PMA-treated cells stimulated with Ca2+o versus neomycin in the absence of Ca2+o (64 and 25%, respectively) suggested that calcium influx stimulated by CaR agonists might be less affected by PMA than calcium mobilization from intracellular stores. To evaluate the effect of PMA on high Ca2+o-evoked sustained increases in Ca2+i as an indirect assessment of Ca2+ influx, Ca2+o-elicited transient increases in Ca2+i were permitted to fall for a longer period of time (100 s in Fig. 3 versus25 s in Fig. 1) after each addition of Ca2+o. The sustained responses observed in this experiment were defined as the increased levels of Ca2+i that remained at 100 s after each incremental addition of agonist, and these responses reflect the new steady states, in which influx and efflux of Ca2+ are nearly equal. As shown in Fig. 3, PMA markedly reduced the transient Ca2+i responses at low Ca2+o concentrations (1.5–3.5 mm), similar to the earlier observations made in Fig. 1, A andB. Thus the cumulative transient Ca2+iresponses were markedly affected by PMA (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the sustained Ca2+i responses were similar in control and PMA-treated cells (Fig. 4 B). In cells mock-transfected with vector alone, there was also a gradual Ca2+iincrease. However, at least 60% of this increase resulted from leakage of fura-2 over the ∼20-min time course of these experiments, which was marginally affected by PMA (Fig. 3, C and D, and Fig. 4). Although the transfection efficiency was less than 25%, the sustained Ca2+i responses in the receptor-transfected cells were significantly higher than those in vector-transfected cells.Figure 4Concentration dependence for the Ca2+o-evoked transient and sustained Ca2+i responses in the presence or absence of PMA. In this figure, the transient and sustained Ca2+i responses in Fig. 3 were plotted against the concentrations of Ca2+o added (see under “Experimental Procedures”). HEK293 cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector (circles), or the CaR (squares) were mock-treated (open symbols) or treated (filled symbols) with PMA. A, all of the transient responses (i.e. the cumulative peak responses) are normalized to the maximal cumulative response of the CaR at 20 mmCa2+o in the absence of PMA. B, all of the sustained responses (i.e. the increased level of Ca2+i that persisted at 100 s after each addition of Ca2+o) are normalized to the maximal sustained response of the CaR at 20 mmCa2+o in the absence of PMA.

Some error bars are smaller than the symbol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to demonstrate further that the effect of PKC activators on the function of the CaR was mediated by PKC, we examined the effect of a PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, on CaR-evoked Ca2+iresponses (Fig. 5). Pretreatment of CaR-transfected HEK293 cells with 1 μm staurosporine for 30 min significantly reduced the EC50[Ca2+o] from 4.0 ± 0.1 mm (n = 34; TableI) to 2.9 ± 0.1 mm(n = 22; Table I) (p ≤ 0.05). In addition, the pretreatment prevented the inhibitory effects of PMA (Fig. 5) and other PKC activators (data not shown) on the Ca2+i responses to the same extent, further supporting the conclusion that the effect of PKC activators on CaR-dependent changes in"

A lysine-specific cysteine proteinase (Lys-gingipain, KGP), as well as an arginine-specific cysteine proteinase (Arg-gingipain), is a major trypsin-like proteinase of the organism. Recent studies indicate that the secreted KGP is implicated in the destruction of periodontal tissue and the disruption of host defense mechanisms. In this study, we have constructed a KGP-deficient mutant to determine whether the cell-associated KGP is important for pathophysiology of the organism. Although the mutant retained the strong ability to disrupt the bactericidal activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, its hemagglutination activity was reduced to about one-half that observed with the wild-type strain. More important, the mutant did not form black-pigmented colonies on blood agar plates, indicating the defect of hemoglobin adsorption and heme accumulation. Immunoblot analysis showed that the expression of a 19-kDa hemoglobin receptor protein, which is thought to be responsible for hemoglobin binding by the organism, was greatly retarded in this mutant. The mutant also showed a marked decrease in the ability to degrade fibrinogen. These results suggest the possible involvement of KGP in the hemoglobin binding and heme accumulation of the organism and in the bleeding tendency in periodontal pockets.

Previous studies of RGP-deficient mutants constructed by use of suicide plasmid systems revealed that RGP plays a major role in the disruption of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) functions and the hemagglutination and fimbriation by the organism (20Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 21Nakayama K. Yoshimura F. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2818-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little information is available about to what extent KGP contributes to the entire virulence of P. gingivalis. To gain some insight into this question, it is necessary to undertake the molecular genetic approach. So far, three genes encoding Lys-X-specific cysteine proteinases have been cloned and sequenced, but all of the genes seem to be essentially equivalent to one another (24Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Barkocy-Gallagher G.A. Han N. Patti J.M. Whitlock J. Progulski-Fox A. Lantz M.S. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1595-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Southern hybridization analyses have also suggested that a single KGP-encoding gene exists on the chromosome of P. gingivalis (24Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the kgp gene of P. gingivalis strain and the deduced amino acid sequence have suggested that the precursor of KGP comprises at least four domains: the signal peptide, the amino-terminal propeptide, the catalytic proteinase domain, and the carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin domain. In the present study, we have constructed a KGP-deficient mutant via disruption of the kgp gene by use of suicide plasmid systems to analyze the function of KGP in the organism. The results provide evidence suggesting that KGP is associated with hemagglutination, hemoglobin binding and heme accumulation by the organism, and the bleeding tendency in periodontal pockets and that it is not directly implicated in the production of virulence factors responsible for suppression of the bactericidal activity of PMNs. P. gingivalis cells were grown anaerobically (10% CO2, 10% H2, 80% N2) in enriched BHI broth (containing, per liter, 37 g of brain heart infusion (Difco), 5 g of yeast extract (Difco), 1 g of cysteine, 5 mg of hemin, and 1 mg of vitamin K1) and on enriched BHI agar (containing, per liter, 15 g of agar (Nakarai, Tokyo, Japan), 37 g of brain heat infusion, 5 g of yeast extract, 1 g of cysteine, 5 mg of hemin, and 1 mg of vitamin K1). L broth (containing, per liter, 10 g of tryptone (Difco), 5 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of sodium chloride) was used for growingEscherichia coli cells. For selection or maintenance of the antibiotic-resistant strains, antibiotics were added to the medium at the following concentrations: ampicilin, 200 μg/ml; erythromycin, 10 μg/ml. Chromosomal DNA was isolated from P. gingivalis cells by the guanidine isothiocyanate method (27Lippke J.A. Strzempko M.N. Raia F.F. Simon S.L. Frech C.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 2588-2589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the IsoQuick DNA extraction kit (MicroProbe, Garden Grove, CA) for Southern blot analyses. Suicide plasmids constructed in this study are depicted in Fig. 1. An ∼3.5-kbp BamHI fragment of plasmid pNKV (24Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), containing the gene of whole KGP proteinase domain, was ligated to pUC118, which was digested with EcoRI, filled in by the Klenow enzyme, digested with BamHI, and treated with alkaline phosphatase. The resulting plasmid was then digested with EcoRI and self-ligated to make a deletion within the kgp gene, giving rise to plasmid pNKV-2. A BamHI chromosomal fragment (3.3 kbp) of pNKV-2 was then ligated to pKD283 DNA (28Nakayama K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that had been linearized with BamHI and treated with alkaline phosphatase, resulting in plasmid pNKD. Two synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-GCTAGTGCTGCTCCGGTCTTCTTGG-3′ (Probe I) and 5′-GCGAGGACTACTATTGGAGTGTCGG-3′ (probe II), were obtained from Greiner Japan (Tokyo, Japan) and Kurabo (Osaka, Japan), respectively, and were labeled with fluorescein-dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). Chromosomal DNA of wild-type and KGP-deficient strains was digested with HindIII and subjected to a 0.8% agarose gel for Southern blot analysis. Digested genome DNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) essentially according to Southern (29Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21353) Google Scholar). Hybridization with probes I and II and detection of signals were done by using the ECL 3′-oligolabeling (Amersham) and the SuperSignalTM Nucleic Acid (Pierce), respectively. P. gingivalis cells were anaerobically grown to 6 × 108/ml at 37 °C in enriched BHI broth. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed with the electroporation solution (300 mm sucrose), and resuspended in 0.1 volume of the same solution. 10 μl of pNKD plasmid DNA solution (300 μg of DNA/ml in TE buffer) were added to 0.4 ml of the cell suspension. The whole volume of the DNA-containing cell suspension was poured into a cuvette for electroporation (PulserTMcuvette with 0.2-cm electrode gap, Bio-Rad). Electroporation was performed at 2.0 kV with an electroporation apparatus (Gene PulserTM, Bio-Rad). These procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cell suspension was immediately mixed with 10 ml of prewarmed enriched BHI broth and incubated anaerobically at 37 °C for 15 h. Cells of the culture were spread on enriched tryptic soy agar containing erythromycin and incubated anaerobically at 37 °C for 7 days. 24-hour cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Ammonium sulfate was added to the culture supernatant to a final concentration of 75% saturation. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and suspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.05% Brij 35. After overnight dialysis against the same buffer at 4 °C, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was used as a culture supernatant in this study. On the other hand, bacterial cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.05% Brij 35. Cell extracts were prepared by ultrasonication followed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The proteinase inhibitor leupeptin was added to a solubilizing buffer to avoid proteolysis by endogenous proteinases. For immunoblotting, proteins on SDS gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to the method of Towbin et al. (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The blotted membranes were immunostained with the antibodies immunoreacting both RGP and KGP (20Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) or the antibodies specific for the 19-kDa hemoglobin receptor protein purified essentially according to the procedure described previously (32Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Lys-X- and Arg-X-specific cysteine proteinase activities were determined by use of the synthetic substrates t-butyloxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-Lys-MCA and carbobenzoxy-Phe-Arg-MCA, respectively, as described previously (7Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Okamoto K. Maeda K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21371-21378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Abe N. Kadowaki-Tsukuba T. Nakayama K. Okamoto K. Ohishi M. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture (1 ml) contained various amounts of the cell extracts or the culture supernatants, 10 μm each synthetic substrate, and 5 mm cysteine in 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). After incubation at 40 °C for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of 10 mmiosoacetic acid (pH 5.0), and the released 7-amino-4-metylcoumarin was measured at 460 nm (excitation at 380 nm) on a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The cell-free culture supernatants of the P. gingivalis strains were obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Ammonium sulfate was added to the culture supernatant to give 75% saturation. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and resuspend in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.05% Brij 35. After dialysis against the same buffer at 4 °C overnight, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 30 min. 20 μg of human fibrinogen were incubated with the respective dialysates (1 μg) for 4 h at 37 °C, and then electrophoresis was performed on SDS gels. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Five points of each band were measured and averaged by Microcomputer Imaging Device. Hemoglobin adsorption was determined essentially according to Fujimura et al. (34Fujimura S. Shibata Y. Hirai K. Nakamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, P. gingivaliscells were grown anaerobically in enriched BHI broth overnight. The cells were harvested from 1 ml of the culture, washed with 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 6.0), and resuspended in the original volume of the same buffer. Cell density of the suspension was then adjusted to an optical density (650 nm) of 0.73. The cell suspension (730 μl) was mixed with 270 μl of human hemoglobin (1 mg/ml in the same buffer). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 or 60 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The absorbance of the supernatant was then measured at 410 nm. Adsorbed hemoglobin was evaluated by decrease of absorbance of the supernatant. CL response of PMNs was measured according to the method described previously (7Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Okamoto K. Maeda K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21371-21378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of P. gingivalis strains were centrifuged, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in PBS at an optimal density at 660 nm of 0.44. The bacterial suspensions were then diluted in a 2-fold series with PBS. A 100-μl aliquot each of the dilutions was mixed with an equal volume of sheep erythrocyte suspension (2.5% in PBS) and incubated in a round-bottom microtiter plate at room temperature for 3 h. A KGP-deficient mutant was constructed via gene disruption by use of a suicide plasmid containing a part of thekgp gene. The suicide plasmid pNKD contained an amino-terminal region of the kgp gene lacking a 132-bpEcoRI region within the gene. Emr transformants were obtained after introduction of pNKD plasmid DNA into P. gingivalis ATCC33277 by electroporation (Fig.2 A). Four possible chromosomal structures may arise from integration of the plasmid DNA: single cross-over types (a and b) and apparent gene conversion types (c and d) (Fig. 2 A). Types a and b could be accounted for by reciprocal recombination between homologous DNA regions of the chromosome and the plasmid, whereas types c and d would be generated by multiple reciprocal recombination or nonreciprocal recombination (gene conversion) (35Lindegren C.C. Science. 1955; 121: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36Orr-Weaver T. Szostak J.W. Rothstein R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6354-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Southern analyses revealed that we only obtained two types of Emr transformants: one (type c) with the intact kgp gene (KDM16) and the other (type d) with a deletion in kgp (KDM35), whereas Emrtransformants of types a and b could not be obtained. Thus, Southern hybridization analysis of their chromosomes was carried out with two synthetic oligonucleotides to determine which types of transformants were produced. Probe I was a 25-bp oligonucleotide hybridizing to one region of the KGP proteinase domain, whereas probe II was a 25-bp oligonucleotide hybridizing a region within the 132-bp EcoRI region. The chromosomal DNA of the Emr transformants of types a and b has two HindIII DNA fragments (1.2 and 1 kbp) hybridizing to probe I and II. The chromosomal DNA of c-type transformants has one HindIII fragment (1.2 kbp) hybridizing to probe I and II, whereas that of d-type transformants has oneHindIII fragment (1 kbp) hybridizing to probe I and no DNA fragment hybridizing to probe II. The chromosomal DNA of the wild-type parent has one HindIII fragment (1.2 kbp) hybridizing to probes I and II. Southern analysis using probes I and II revealed that KDM16 and KDM35 were of types c and d, respectively (Fig.2 B). To determine whether the transformant KDM35 was devoid of KGP protein, immunoblot analysis of the mutant was performed by use of antibodies reacting with both KGP and RGP (Fig.3). The culture supernatant of ATCC33277 (wild-type parent) showed four clear protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 51, 44, 40 and 32 kDa and a smearing band of 70–100 kDa. There was no significant difference in electrophoretic profiles between KDM16 and ATCC33277, although the 40- and 32-kDa proteins were markedly decreased in KDM16. The 32-kDa protein was also detected in KDM35. However, both the cell extract and culture supernatant of KDM35 was devoid of the 51-kDa band. The 40-kDa protein could be detected by immunoblotting of a large amount of the supernatant proteins of KDM35, whereas the 51-kDa protein was not observed under the same conditions (data not shown). Therefore, the 51-kDa protein appeared to be KGP. On the other hand, the proteins of 44, 40, 32, and 70–100 kDa seemed to be derived from thergp gene products, although its expression level was slightly different between the wild-type parent and its mutants, which was consistent with a previous study (20Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). KGP can specifically cleave the Lys-X peptide bond. The proteolytic activity on the synthetic substratet-butyloxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-Lys-MCA was scarcely detectable in either the cell extract or the culture supernatant of KDM35, whereas KDM16 showed the same activity in these fractions as the parent ATCC33277 (Fig. 4 A). On the other hand, the hydrolyzing activity on the synthetic substrate carbobenzoxy-Phe-Arg-MCA, which represents the RGP activity, was not significantly changed in either fraction of KDM35, as well as KDM16 (Fig. 4 B). Thus, KDM35 was found to be devoid of KGP at the protein and activity levels, indicating that KDM35 is a KGP-deficient mutant that possesses a deletion within the proteinase domain region of the kgp gene. The culture supernatant of the wild-type strain contained potent virulence factors, which disrupt the bactericidal function of PMNs (37Yoneda M. Maeda K. Aono M. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 406-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both RGP and KGP purified from the culture supernatant of P. gingivalis exhibited the potent suppressive activity against the CL response of PMNs stimulated by serum-activated zymosan (7Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Okamoto K. Maeda K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21371-21378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Abe N. Kadowaki-Tsukuba T. Nakayama K. Okamoto K. Ohishi M. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Further, in agreement with the previous results (20Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), the culture supernatant of the RGP-null mutant (the rgpA rgpB double mutant, KDP112) was shown to almost completely lose the inhibitory effect on the CL response of PMNs, confirming that RGP is responsible for suppression of the bactericidal function of PMNs (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the culture supernatant of the KGP-deficient mutant (KDM35), like the wild-type strain and KDM16, resulted in the intense inhibition of the CL response of PMNs, suggesting that contribution of KGP to the inhibition of the bactericidal activity of PMNs by the culture supernatant of P. gingivalis is not as much as that of RGP and that KGP is not directly involved in the production of P. gingivalis factors responsible for the inhibition. In our previous study (20Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), we found that the RGP-null mutant showed a greater decrease in the hemagglutinating activity observed with the wild-type strain. Because the initial translation product of KGP appeared to contain the hemagglutinin domain in the carboxyl-terminal region (24Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which is significantly homologous to that of the RGP gene product (38Okamoto K. Misumi Y. Kadowaki T. Yoneda M. Yamamoto K. Ikehara Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 316: 917-925Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it is of special importance to determine whether KGP is related to hemagglutination of P. gingivalis. The RGP-null mutant almost completely lost the intense hemagglutinating activity observed with the wild-type strain. Although KDM16 had the same hemagglutinating activity as the wild-type strain, KDM35 reduced the extent of hemagglutination to one-half those of the wild-type strain and KDM16 (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate a significant contribution of the cell-associated KGP to the hemagglutination of P. gingivalis. As shown in Fig.6, P. gingivalis strains produce black-pigmented colonies on laked blood agar plates. It is generally accepted that the black pigments are heme, which is an absolute requirement for growth of P. gingivalis (39Gibbons R.J. MacDonald J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1960; 80: 164-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Shah H.N. Bonnett R. Mateen B. Williams R.A.D. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and that it is probably derived from erythrocytes in the natural niche for the organism. Therefore, it is particularly important for the organism to aggregate and lyse erythrocytes to survive in vivo (41Chu L. Bramanti T.E. Ebersole J.L. Holt S.C. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1932-1940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Shah H.N. Gharbia S.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 61: 213-218Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine whether KGP is involved in the formation of black-pigmented colonies, KDM35 was grown on laked sheep blood agar. Although KDM16, like the wild-type strain, developed black-pigmented colonies, KDM35 formed less pigmented colonies (Fig.6). Further, it is questionable whether KDM35, the RGP-null mutant, and the wild-type strain can form black-pigmented colonies when grown on enriched tryptic soy agar plates with or without 2% hemoglobin (data not shown). On the plate without hemoglobin, neither of them showed both cell growth and black pigmentation. However, in the presence of hemin in enriched tryptic soy agar plates each strain resulted in the cell growth but not black pigmentation. In the presence of hemoglobin, only KDM35 did not form black-pigmented colonies, but it retained the cell growth activity. These findings indicate that KGP seems to be involved in the hemoglobin adsorption and the heme accumulation by the organism. More recent work in our laboratory has resulted in the identification and purification of a prominent 19-kDa protein that was significantly expressed in P. gingivalis when grown on blood agar plate (32Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This protein was found to be the hemoglobin receptor (HbR) protein (34Fujimura S. Shibata Y. Hirai K. Nakamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was intragenically encoded by thergp1, kgp, and hagA genes of P. gingivalis (24Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 43Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 44Han N. Whitlock J. Progulski-Fox A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4000-4007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, it was interesting to note that HbR protein was not expressed in nonpigmented mutants (BE1 and BR1) that were isolated from the W50 strain of P. gingivalis (45Mckee A.S. McDermid A.S. Wait R. Baskerville A. Marsh P.D. J. Med. Microbiol. 1988; 27: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and that the ability of these mutants to bind hemoglobin was markedly decreased (34Fujimura S. Shibata Y. Hirai K. Nakamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether the decreased pigmentation of KDM35 is attributable to a defect of hemoglobin adsorption, we examined the mutant for the ability to bind hemoglobin. The results indicate that KDM35 binds hemoglobin to a lesser extent than the kgp + sibling strain KDM16 (Fig.7 A). Immunoblot analysis with anti-HbR antiserum revealed that the cell extract of KDM35 grown on the laked blood agar for 3 days produced no HbR protein, whereas that of KDM16 produced a single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa (Fig. 7 B). However, after 7 days of incubation KDM35 produced a small amount of the HbR protein, and after 17 days it produced as much as that of KDM16. Fibrinogen is a 300-kDa protein that consists of three pairs of polypeptide chains (designated Aα, Bβ, and γ) covalently linked by disulfide bonds. Thrombin is known to convert fibrinogen to fibrin monomers, leading to forming of a fibrin gel. Because of the bleeding tendency in periodontal pockets and the observation that P. gingivalis gingipains cleave fibrinogen (46Scott C.F. Whitaker E.J. Hammond B.F. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7935-7942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Ciborowski P. Nishikata M. Allen R.D. Lantz M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4549-4557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Imamura T. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Moore J.N. Barton M.H. Travis J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether KGP contributes to blocking blood coagulation in the periodontal pockets. For this, the culture supernatants freshly harvested from KDM35, KDP112, and the wild-type strain were incubated with human fibrinogen at 37 °C for 4 h (Fig. 8 A). All of the chains were extensively degraded by the culture supernatants of the wild-type strain and the RGP-null mutant, although the former was more effective than the latter. However, the culture supernatant of the KGP-deficient mutant KDM35 was less effective in proteolysis of these chains, especially Bβ and γ chains. Densitometric scanning revealed that the degradation by the culture supernatant of KDM35 was reduced to about one-half that of the wild-type strain for the Aα and Bβ chains and one-fourth that of the wild-type strain for the γ chain (Fig. 8 B). In our previous study (20Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), we constructed RGP-deficient mutants from P. gingivalis ATCC33277 and provided evidence suggesting that RGP plays critical roles in inhibition of the bactericidal activity of PMNs and the hemagglutination by the organism. In this study, we have constructed the KGP-deficient mutant, designated KDM35, from P. gingivalis ATCC33277 by integration of the Emr suicide plasmid pNKD containing a DNA fragment of the gene to clarify the KGP function in the organism. The cell extract and culture medium of KDM35 showed no Lys-X-specific cysteine proteinase activity but still retained the same Arg-X-specific cysteine proteinase activity as that of the wild-type strain in both fractions, indicating that only the KGP proteinase gene is disrupted. We have previously shown that the initial translation product of KGP, like RGP, contains the hemagglutinin-related sequence in the carboxyl-terminal domain (24Okamoto K. Kadowaki T. Nakayama K. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and that the RGP-null mutant KDP112 is almost devoid of the hemagglutinating activity and loses the inhibitory effect on the bactericidal activity of PMNs (20Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). More recently, we have also found that the purified KGP significantly inhibits the bactericidal activity of PMNs (37Yoneda M. Maeda K. Aono M. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 406-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study we determined to what extent KGP contributes to the disruption of host defense mechanisms and the hemagglutinating activity by P. gingivalis by biochemical analysis of the KGP-deficient mutant KDM35. Morphologically, KDM35 possessed a similar number of characteristic kinky fimbriae on the cell surface of the wild-type strain. Taken together, the precursors of fimbrilin, a major component of fimbriae, and a 75-kDa cell surface protein have been shown to undergo normal processing in KDM35. 2T. Kadowaki, K. Nakayama, F. Yoshimura, K. Okamoto, and K. Yamamoto, submitted for publication. These results suggest that KGP is not significantly involved in processing and translocation of the cell surface proteins. The culture supernatant of this mutant also had the same suppressive activity on the CL response of PMNs as that of the wild-type strain, indicating that KGP has little contribution to production of virulence factor(s) responsible for disruption of the bactericidal activity of PMNs. This is consistent with the observation that the culture supernatant of RGP-null mutant almost completely lost the inhibitory effect of the culture supernatant of P. gingivalis on the CL response of PMNs (Fig. 5) (20Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In contrast, KDM35 showed a significant decrease in the hemagglutinating activity, suggesting that KGP significantly contributes to the generation of hemagglutinins from the initial translation products of hemagglutinin-related genes, such asrgp1, kgp, and hagA, B, C (49Lee S.-W. Hillman J.D. Progulski-Fox A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4802-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inP. gingivalis strains. However, because the RGP-null mutant is almost devoid of the hemagglutinating activity, KGP seems likely to make a relatively small contribution to the production of hemagglutinins, as compared with RGP. A noteworthy and unforeseen property of KDM35 was the reduced black pigmentation. The characteristic black colonies of P. gingivalis on blood agar is thought to be caused by accumulation of heme. The ability to utilize heme and heme-containing compounds has also been found in several pathogenic microorganisms (50Genco C.A. Desai P.J. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 179-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Black pigmentation of colonies by heme accumulation, however, is known in limited bacterial species in the genera Porphyromonas andPrevotella. Although this property is thought to be related to virulence of P. gingivalis (51Shah H.N. Seddon S.V. Gharbia S.E. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 4: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it is not yet clear howP. gingivalis cells acquire heme from erythrocytes and other host components. Recently, Fujimura et al. (34Fujimura S. Shibata Y. Hirai K. Nakamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) isolated the 19-kDa hemoglobin-binding protein from the envelope of P. gingivalis by affinity chromatography. Then we found that the 19-kDa hemoglobin-binding protein was encoded by internal domain regions (e.g. HGP15 in rgp1) of multiple genes:rgp1, kgp, and hagA (32Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We proposed renaming the hemoglobin-binding protein the hemoglobin receptor (HbR) domain protein. In addition, we found that nonpigmented mutants (BE1 and BR1) isolated from P. gingivalis W50 did not express the HbR domain protein and showed deficiency in hemoglobin adsorption, which indicated a close relationship among HbR production, hemoglobin adsorption, and pigmentation of P. gingivalis. P. gingivalisW50 BE1 also showed reduced virulence in mouse infection model, a decrease in trypsin-like proteinase production, and loss of hemagglutination (45Mckee A.S. McDermid A.S. Wait R. Baskerville A. Marsh P.D. J. Med. Microbiol. 1988; 27: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 51Shah H.N. Seddon S.V. Gharbia S.E. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 4: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The HbR domain protein is likely to be generated by proteolytic processing of the polyproteins fromrgp1, kgp, and hagA. The HbR protein has a Lys residue at the carboxyl terminus, indicating involvement of KGP in this cleavage. Immunoblot analysis with anti-HbR antiserum revealed that KDM35 growing on the laked blood agar for 3 days had no proteins immunoreacted with the antiserum, whereas thekgp + sibling strain KDM16 showed an immunoreactive 19-kDa protein band. The results suggest the contribution of KGP to the production of the HbR domain protein. However, the HbR protein was produced in the cells of the KGP-deficient mutant after prolonged incubation. This slow expression of the HbR domain protein of KDM35 might account for its reduced pigmentation. Why was the 19-kDa HbR domain protein detected in KDM35 after prolonged incubation? It could be explained by the fact that the carboxyl-terminal processing of the HbR domain protein in the KDM35 might be done in a much slower mode by an unknown proteinase. The proteinase should not be specific for Lys-X, because the KGP-deficient mutant showed no lysine-specific proteinase activity. Molecular mass of the HbR protein expressed in the KGP-deficient mutant was almost the same as those of the wild-type strain and KDM16. Therefore, the cleavage site by the unknown proteinase should be very close to the carboxyl-terminal Lys residue. Another possibility is that some of the HbR domains in the rgp1 and hagA genes of strain ATCC33277 may possess a different residue such as Arg at the carboxyl terminus because the nucleotide sequences of these genes of the strain have not been determined. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility of the presence of another anti-HbR cross-reactive protein with a molecular mass of 19-kDa that might be expressed after prolonged incubation on blood agar plates. The final characterization of the KGP-deficient mutant KDM35 was the association of KGP with the fibrinogenolytic activity. Fibrinogen is a major component of the coagulation cascade. Upon cleavage by thrombin, fibrin monomers polymerize and form a meshwork that traps platelets and blood cells. Although the culture supernatants of the wild-type strain and the RGP-null mutant extensively degraded all of the chains of fibrinogen, that of the KGP-deficient mutant showed a marked decrease in their degradation (especially the γ chain). It has been demonstrated that the fibrinogen Aα chain is rapidly degraded by both Arg-X- and Lys-X-specific cysteine proteinases from P. gingivalis and that Lys-X-specific cysteine proteinase(s) is a much more potent fibrinogenolytic enzyme than Arg-specific cysteine proteinase(s) (46Scott C.F. Whitaker E.J. Hammond B.F. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7935-7942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Ciborowski P. Nishikata M. Allen R.D. Lantz M.S. J.

Our data in this report are also consistent with these observations. The intense fibrinogenolytic activity of KGP appears to render fibrinogen unclottable and may contribute to a propensity for bleeding in periodontal pockets of periodontitis patients. This may therefore represent another virulence that facilitates the bacterial survival and invasion of host tissues."

Unlike the SecD subunit of the pre-protein translocase ofEscherichia coli, SecDF of B. subtilis was not required for the release of a mature secretory protein from the membrane, indicating that SecDF is involved in earlier translocation steps. Strains lacking intact SecDF showed a cold-sensitive phenotype, which was exacerbated by high level production of secretory proteins, indicating that protein translocation in B. subtilis is intrinsically cold-sensitive. Comparison with SecD and SecF proteins from other organisms revealed the presence of 10 conserved regions in SecDF, some of which appear to be important for SecDF function. Interestingly, the SecDF protein of B. subtilis has 12 putative transmembrane domains. Thus, SecDF does not only show sequence similarity but also structural similarity to secondary solute transporters.

Our data suggest that SecDF of B. subtilisrepresents a novel type of the SecD and SecF proteins, which seems to be present in at least two other organisms. The translocation of proteins across biological membranes involves the action of complex machineries, consisting of at least two functional units as follows: a force generator (motor) and a translocation channel (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli is the best characterized of the eubacterial protein translocation machineries. The so-called pre-protein translocase of E. coli consists of at least seven proteins as follows: SecA, SecD, SecE, SecF, SecG, SecY, and YajC. SecA is a peripheral membrane protein, which generates the driving force for the initiation of precursor transport through the translocation channel, of which SecY, SecE, and SecG are the most important components. Recent studies suggest that SecY, SecE, and SecG form a heterotrimeric subcomplex (SecYEG) of a large “holoenzyme,” which also contains a heterotrimeric subcomplex of SecD, SecF, and YajC (SecDFyajC; see Refs. 2Driessen A.J.M.

Once protein translocation is initiated by SecA, further translocation is driven both by SecA and the proton motive force (PMF 1The abbreviations used are: PMFproton motive forceIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosidePCRpolymerase chain reactionTYtryptone/yeast extractPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: PMFproton motive forceIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosidePCRpolymerase chain reactionTYtryptone/yeast extractPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ; Refs.4Geller B.L.

Current models suggest that SecA drives protein transport through cycles of pre-protein binding, membrane insertion, pre-protein release, and deinsertion from the membrane (7Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 8Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The cycling of SecA is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis, which causes major conformational changes in this protein (9den Blaauwen T. Fekkes P. de Wit J.G. Kuiper W. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11194-12004Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The role of SecDFyajC in protein translocation in E. coli is not completely clear, in particular because it is not essential for protein translocation in vitro (11Wickner W. Driessen A.J. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 101-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and because SecD and SecF are required to maintain a stable PMF (12Arkowitz R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, SecDFyajC seems to be involved in at least three aspects of the translocation process: first, the cycling of SecA is modulated by SecDFyajC, which stabilizes the membrane-inserted state of SecA (8Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 13Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); second, SecDFyajC seems to stimulate PMF-driven protein translocation (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); and third, SecD appears to be required for the release of mature proteins from the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane (16Matsuyama S. Fujita Y. Mizushima S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, SecDFyajC may have an indirect role in protein translocation in E. coli, for example in the assembly of the protein translocase complex, the gating of the translocation channel (17Pohlschröder M. Prinz W.A. Hartmann E. Beckwith J. Cell. 1997; 91: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), or the stimulation of PMF-driven protein translocation (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Although homologues of SecD and SecF of E. coli have been identified in several eubacteria and archaea (17Pohlschröder M. Prinz W.A. Hartmann E. Beckwith J. Cell. 1997; 91: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), their role in protein translocation has not been addressed experimentally. In the present studies, we have investigated the role of the SecD and SecF equivalents in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which is a particularly suitable organism for this purpose: first, B. subtilis secretes proteins into the growth medium directly after translocation across the membrane (see Ref. 18Simonen M. Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); second, the capacity for protein secretion can be probed under conditions of hypersecretion (19Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2333-2344PubMed Google Scholar); third, important components of the protein translocation machinery of B. subtilis, such as SecA, SecY, and SecE, have been identified (20Nakamura K. Nakamura A. Takamatsu H. Yoshikawa H. Yamane K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 107: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Suh J-. W. Boylan S.A. Thomas S.M. Dolan K.M. Oliver D.B.

Microbiol. 1993; 10: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); and fourth, the gene for a SecF-like protein was recently identified by genome sequencing (24Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike the secF genes fromE. coli and other well characterized microorganisms, thesecF-like gene of B. subtilis seemed to represent a natural gene fusion between the equivalents of secD andsecF. The results of our studies show that the SecD and SecF equivalents of B. subtilis are indeed jointly present in one polypeptide, which is required for efficient translocation of secretory pre-proteins under conditions of hypersecretion.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we demonstrate that the SecDF protein ofB. subtilis is required for efficient translocation and processing of the secretory precursor pre-AmyQ and the secretion of mature AmyQ into the growth medium. The reduced secretion of AmyQ by cells lacking intact SecDF was paralleled by the accumulation of pre-AmyQ. These findings show that SecDF (B. subtilis), like SecD and SecF of E. coli, is required for protein translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane and that the function of SecDF in protein translocation is most likely conserved among eubacteria. Notably, the SecDF-depleted cells did not accumulate mature AmyQ. Thus, it seems that SecDF (B. subtilis), unlike SecD of E. coli (16Matsuyama S. Fujita Y. Mizushima S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34Gardel C. Johnson K. Jacq A. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), is not required for the release of mature proteins from the membrane.The observation that secDF mutants grow at reduced rates at low temperature indicates that protein translocation in B. subtilis is intrinsically cold-sensitive, as previously suggested for protein translocation in E. coli (42Pogliano K.J. Beckwith J. Genetics. 1993; 133: 763-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to E. coli mutants with disrupted secDand/or secF genes, which are cold-sensitive for growth and barely viable at 37 °C (43Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), B. subtilis strains, which contain a disrupted secDF gene (this paper) or which completely lack the secDF gene (not shown), show normal growth and cell viability at 37 °C and do not stop growing at low temperature. SecDF was only essential for growth at 15 °C when AmyQ was overproduced. These findings indicate that SecDF is not strictly required for protein translocation in B. subtilis and that the degree in which SecDF is required depends on the level of synthesis of secretory proteins. The latter view is supported by the observation that the secretion of NprE, which was produced at about 30–50-fold lower levels than AmyQ, was not affected in strains lacking SecDF, even at low temperature (not shown). In addition, even when AmyQ was overproduced, SecDF-depleted cells did not stop to grow instantaneously after a shift from 37 to 15 °C, as growth defects were only observed after cells had entered the mid-exponential growth phase. The latter observation suggests that SecDF is not required for early exponential growth, which is consistent with the fact that exponentially growing cells of B. subtilis secrete only few proteins (see Ref.44Ferrari E. Jarnagin A.S. Schmidt B.F. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 917-937Google Scholar). Although SecDF is involved in protein secretion, which is a post-exponential growth phase-specific phenomenon in B. subtilis, this protein is neither required for the development of competence for DNA binding and uptake nor sporulation (not shown), two post-exponential processes that require the activity of SecA (22Sadaie Y. Takamatsu M. Nakamura K. Yamane K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 98: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that the transcription of two signal peptidase-encoding genes, sipS and sipT, is concerted with that of the genes for most secretory proteins, which is temporally controlled, being high in the post-exponential growth phase (30Bolhuis A. Sorokin A. Azevedo V. Ehrlich S.D. Braun P.G. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 41Tjalsma H. Noback M.A. Bron S. Venema G. Yamane K. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25983-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our present data show that the transcription ofsecDF is regulated differently as follows: 1) when cells were grown in minimal medium, secDF was transcribed constitutively, whereas the transcription of sipS andsipT was temporally controlled; 2) when cells were grown in TY medium, secDF transcription was maximal in the early post-exponential growth phase, whereas the levels of sipSand sipT transcription that were low in the exponential growth phase started to increase in the transition phase and remained high in the post-exponential growth phase; and 3) when cells were grown in TY medium with 1% glucose, secDF transcription was highly stimulated in the post-exponential growth phase, whereassipS transcription was not stimulated. 2A. Bolhuis, C. P. Broekhuizen, A. Sorokin, M. L. van Roosmalen, G. Venema, S. Bron, W. J. Quax, and J. Maarten van Dijl, unpublished observations. The effect of glucose on the transcription of secDF is remarkable, because the transcription of most genes for secretory proteins is repressed by glucose (45Chambliss G.H. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 213-219Google Scholar) and because glucose did not significantly stimulate the transcription of genes for other components of the secretion machinery, such as SecA and the type II signal peptidase.2 Presently, it is difficult to explain why the patterns of secDFtranscription do not correlate with those of genes specifying secretory proteins, or the signal peptidases SipS and SipT. One possible explanation is that the turnover rates of SecDF depend on the growth conditions and that B. subtilis can maintain a sufficient level of the SecDF protein through controlled transcription of thesecDF gene.In contrast to most other organisms, the SecD and SecF equivalents ofB. subtilis 168 are jointly present in one polypeptide, which can thus be considered as a “molecular siamese twin.” This observation suggests that, in general, SecD and SecF proteins have a head-to-tail orientation in the translocase complex. The presence of one SecDF protein instead of separate SecD and SecF proteins is probably not a peculiarity of B. subtilis 168. Preliminary sequence data suggest that at least two other organisms,Chlamydia trachomatis and Deinococcus radiodurans, also contain genes specifying SecDF-like proteins. 3Accessible throughchlamydia-www.berkeley.edu:4231 andwww.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/mdb.html. As a consequence of the fusion between the SecD and SecF domains, SecDF (B. subtilis) seems to have 12 transmembrane regions, the amino- and carboxyl termini being localized in the cytoplasm. Thus, SecDF (B. subtilis) shows structural similarity to a large group of secondary solute transporters for which the presence of 12 membrane-spanning domains is characteristic (46Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 5-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As SecDF (B. subtilis) also shows sequence similarity to certain solute transporters (i.e. AcrF and ActII-3), our findings suggest that SecDF (B. subtilis) represents a novel type of the SecD and SecF proteins, with structural resemblance to secondary solute transporters.Comparison of SecDF (B. subtilis) with SecD and SecF proteins from various organisms revealed 10 patterns of conserved residues. Our results show that at least one of the three conserved regions, F2, F3, and F4, is critical for SecDF function, as F2 is disrupted and F3 and F4 are absent from the truncated SecDF protein ofB. subtilis MIF. It is presently not known to what extent the other conserved regions are required for SecDF function.Finally, our observation that secretion defects in B. subtilis strains lacking SecDF are only evident under conditions of hypersecretion shows that SecDF is required to maintain a high capacity for protein secretion. Thus, at least three mechanisms for SecDF function in B. subtilis are conceivable as follows: first, SecDF might stimulate the assembly of active pre-protein translocase complexes; second, SecDF might stimulate PMF-driven protein translocation; and third, SecDF activity might be required to clear the translocation channels from prematurely folded pre-proteins or signal peptides, which might jam the channel or inhibit SecA under conditions of high level production of secretory proteins. The latter concept would be consistent with the observation that SecDF shows structural similarity to secondary solute transporters. The translocation of proteins across biological membranes involves the action of complex machineries, consisting of at least two functional units as follows: a force generator (motor) and a translocation channel (1Schatz G.

The so-called pre-protein translocase of E. coli consists of at least seven proteins as follows: SecA, SecD, SecE, SecF, SecG, SecY, and YajC. SecA is a peripheral membrane protein, which generates the driving force for the initiation of precursor transport through the translocation channel, of which SecY, SecE, and SecG are the most important components. Recent studies suggest that SecY, SecE, and SecG form a heterotrimeric subcomplex (SecYEG) of a large “holoenzyme,” which also contains a heterotrimeric subcomplex of SecD, SecF, and YajC (SecDFyajC; see Refs. 2Driessen A.J.M.

Once protein translocation is initiated by SecA, further translocation is driven both by SecA and the proton motive force (PMF 1The abbreviations used are: PMFproton motive forceIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosidePCRpolymerase chain reactionTYtryptone/yeast extractPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: PMFproton motive forceIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosidePCRpolymerase chain reactionTYtryptone/yeast extractPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ; Refs.4Geller B.L.

Current models suggest that SecA drives protein transport through cycles of pre-protein binding, membrane insertion, pre-protein release, and deinsertion from the membrane (7Economou A. Wickner W.

The cycling of SecA is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis, which causes major conformational changes in this protein (9den Blaauwen T. Fekkes P. de Wit J.G. Kuiper W. Driessen A.J.M.

The role of SecDFyajC in protein translocation in E. coli is not completely clear, in particular because it is not essential for protein translocation in vitro (11Wickner W. Driessen A.J. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 101-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and because SecD and SecF are required to maintain a stable PMF (12Arkowitz R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, SecDFyajC seems to be involved in at least three aspects of the translocation process: first, the cycling of SecA is modulated by SecDFyajC, which stabilizes the membrane-inserted state of SecA (8Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 13Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); second, SecDFyajC seems to stimulate PMF-driven protein translocation (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); and third, SecD appears to be required for the release of mature proteins from the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane (16Matsuyama S. Fujita Y. Mizushima S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, SecDFyajC may have an indirect role in protein translocation in E. coli, for example in the assembly of the protein translocase complex, the gating of the translocation channel (17Pohlschröder M. Prinz W.A. Hartmann E. Beckwith J. Cell. 1997; 91: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), or the stimulation of PMF-driven protein translocation (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although homologues of SecD and SecF of E. coli have been identified in several eubacteria and archaea (17Pohlschröder M. Prinz W.A. Hartmann E. Beckwith J. Cell. 1997; 91: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), their role in protein translocation has not been addressed experimentally. In the present studies, we have investigated the role of the SecD and SecF equivalents in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which is a particularly suitable organism for this purpose: first, B. subtilis secretes proteins into the growth medium directly after translocation across the membrane (see Ref. 18Simonen M. Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); second, the capacity for protein secretion can be probed under conditions of hypersecretion (19Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2333-2344PubMed Google Scholar); third, important components of the protein translocation machinery of B. subtilis, such as SecA, SecY, and SecE, have been identified (20Nakamura K. Nakamura A. Takamatsu H. Yoshikawa H. Yamane K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 107: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Suh J-. W. Boylan S.A. Thomas S.M. Dolan K.M. Oliver D.B.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 98: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Jeong S.M. Yoshikawa H. Takahashi H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); and fourth, the gene for a SecF-like protein was recently identified by genome sequencing (24Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike the secF genes fromE. coli and other well characterized microorganisms, thesecF-like gene of B. subtilis seemed to represent a natural gene fusion between the equivalents of secD andsecF. The results of our studies show that the SecD and SecF equivalents of B. subtilis are indeed jointly present in one polypeptide, which is required for efficient translocation of secretory pre-proteins under conditions of hypersecretion. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we demonstrate that the SecDF protein ofB. subtilis is required for efficient translocation and processing of the secretory precursor pre-AmyQ and the secretion of mature AmyQ into the growth medium. The reduced secretion of AmyQ by cells lacking intact SecDF was paralleled by the accumulation of pre-AmyQ. These findings show that SecDF (B. subtilis), like SecD and SecF of E. coli, is required for protein translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane and that the function of SecDF in protein translocation is most likely conserved among eubacteria. Notably, the SecDF-depleted cells did not accumulate mature AmyQ. Thus, it seems that SecDF (B. subtilis), unlike SecD of E. coli (16Matsuyama S. Fujita Y. Mizushima S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34Gardel C. Johnson K. Jacq A. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), is not required for the release of mature proteins from the membrane.The observation that secDF mutants grow at reduced rates at low temperature indicates that protein translocation in B. subtilis is intrinsically cold-sensitive, as previously suggested for protein translocation in E. coli (42Pogliano K.J. Beckwith J. Genetics. 1993; 133: 763-773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to E. coli mutants with disrupted secDand/or secF genes, which are cold-sensitive for growth and barely viable at 37 °C (43Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), B. subtilis strains, which contain a disrupted secDF gene (this paper) or which completely lack the secDF gene (not shown), show normal growth and cell viability at 37 °C and do not stop growing at low temperature. SecDF was only essential for growth at 15 °C when AmyQ was overproduced. These findings indicate that SecDF is not strictly required for protein translocation in B. subtilis and that the degree in which SecDF is required depends on the level of synthesis of secretory proteins. The latter view is supported by the observation that the secretion of NprE, which was produced at about 30–50-fold lower levels than AmyQ, was not affected in strains lacking SecDF, even at low temperature (not shown). In addition, even when AmyQ was overproduced, SecDF-depleted cells did not stop to grow instantaneously after a shift from 37 to 15 °C, as growth defects were only observed after cells had entered the mid-exponential growth phase. The latter observation suggests that SecDF is not required for early exponential growth, which is consistent with the fact that exponentially growing cells of B. subtilis secrete only few proteins (see Ref.44Ferrari E. Jarnagin A.S. Schmidt B.F. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 917-937Google Scholar). Although SecDF is involved in protein secretion, which is a post-exponential growth phase-specific phenomenon in B. subtilis, this protein is neither required for the development of competence for DNA binding and uptake nor sporulation (not shown), two post-exponential processes that require the activity of SecA (22Sadaie Y. Takamatsu M. Nakamura K. Yamane K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 98: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that the transcription of two signal peptidase-encoding genes, sipS and sipT, is concerted with that of the genes for most secretory proteins, which is temporally controlled, being high in the post-exponential growth phase (30Bolhuis A. Sorokin A. Azevedo V. Ehrlich S.D. Braun P.G. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 41Tjalsma H. Noback M.A. Bron S. Venema G. Yamane K. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25983-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our present data show that the transcription ofsecDF is regulated differently as follows: 1) when cells were grown in minimal medium, secDF was transcribed constitutively, whereas the transcription of sipS andsipT was temporally controlled; 2) when cells were grown in TY medium, secDF transcription was maximal in the early post-exponential growth phase, whereas the levels of sipSand sipT transcription that were low in the exponential growth phase started to increase in the transition phase and remained high in the post-exponential growth phase; and 3) when cells were grown in TY medium with 1% glucose, secDF transcription was highly stimulated in the post-exponential growth phase, whereassipS transcription was not stimulated. 2A. Bolhuis, C. P. Broekhuizen, A. Sorokin, M. L. van Roosmalen, G. Venema, S. Bron, W. J. Quax, and J. Maarten van Dijl, unpublished observations. The effect of glucose on the transcription of secDF is remarkable, because the transcription of most genes for secretory proteins is repressed by glucose (45Chambliss G.H. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 213-219Google Scholar) and because glucose did not significantly stimulate the transcription of genes for other components of the secretion machinery, such as SecA and the type II signal peptidase.2 Presently, it is difficult to explain why the patterns of secDFtranscription do not correlate with those of genes specifying secretory proteins, or the signal peptidases SipS and SipT. One possible explanation is that the turnover rates of SecDF depend on the growth conditions and that B. subtilis can maintain a sufficient level of the SecDF protein through controlled transcription of thesecDF gene.In contrast to most other organisms, the SecD and SecF equivalents ofB. subtilis 168 are jointly present in one polypeptide, which can thus be considered as a “molecular siamese twin.” This observation suggests that, in general, SecD and SecF proteins have a head-to-tail orientation in the translocase complex. The presence of one SecDF protein instead of separate SecD and SecF proteins is probably not a peculiarity of B. subtilis 168. Preliminary sequence data suggest that at least two other organisms,Chlamydia trachomatis and Deinococcus radiodurans, also contain genes specifying SecDF-like proteins. 3Accessible throughchlamydia-www.berkeley.edu:4231 andwww.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/mdb.html. As a consequence of the fusion between the SecD and SecF domains, SecDF (B. subtilis) seems to have 12 transmembrane regions, the amino- and carboxyl termini being localized in the cytoplasm. Thus, SecDF (B. subtilis) shows structural similarity to a large group of secondary solute transporters for which the presence of 12 membrane-spanning domains is characteristic (46Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 5-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As SecDF (B. subtilis) also shows sequence similarity to certain solute transporters (i.e. AcrF and ActII-3), our findings suggest that SecDF (B. subtilis) represents a novel type of the SecD and SecF proteins, with structural resemblance to secondary solute transporters.Comparison of SecDF (B. subtilis) with SecD and SecF proteins from various organisms revealed 10 patterns of conserved residues. Our results show that at least one of the three conserved regions, F2, F3, and F4, is critical for SecDF function, as F2 is disrupted and F3 and F4 are absent from the truncated SecDF protein ofB. subtilis MIF. It is presently not known to what extent the other conserved regions are required for SecDF function.Finally, our observation that secretion defects in B. subtilis strains lacking SecDF are only evident under conditions of hypersecretion shows that SecDF is required to maintain a high capacity for protein secretion. Thus, at least three mechanisms for SecDF function in B. subtilis are conceivable as follows: first, SecDF might stimulate the assembly of active pre-protein translocase complexes; second, SecDF might stimulate PMF-driven protein translocation; and third, SecDF activity might be required to clear the translocation channels from prematurely folded pre-proteins or signal peptides, which might jam the channel or inhibit SecA under conditions of high level production of secretory proteins. The latter concept would be consistent with the observation that SecDF shows structural similarity to secondary solute transporters. In the present study, we demonstrate that the SecDF protein ofB. subtilis is required for efficient translocation and processing of the secretory precursor pre-AmyQ and the secretion of mature AmyQ into the growth medium.

This area was identified as being of potential importance for lipopolysaccharide-inducible TNF expression in the human monocyte cell line Mono Mac 6, based on reporter gene analysis of point mutations at a number of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-like motifs within the human TNF promoter region. The area contains two NF-κB sites, which are here shown by DNase I and methylation interference footprinting to flank a novel binding site. UV cross-linking studies reveal that the novel site can also bind NF-κB as well as an unknown protein(s) of approximately 40 kDa. We show that these three adjacent κB-binding sites differ markedly in their relative affinities for p50/p50, p65/p65, and p65/p50, yet this 39-nucleotide segment of DNA appears capable of binding up to three NF-κB heterodimers simultaneously. Reporter gene studies indicate that each element of the cluster contributes to lipopolysaccharide-induced transcriptional activation in Mono Mac 6 cells.

A fundamental problem in infectious disease is to understand the mechanisms by which microbial stimuli such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharideTNFtumor necrosis factor-αNF-κBnuclear factor κBntnucleotide(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. regulate the expression of human inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF). Production of TNF by macrophages and monocytes occurs early in infection and orchestrates much of the subsequent inflammatory response (1Beutler B. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 625-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Because excessive production of TNF is responsible for many of the pathological consequences of severe infection, its regulation is critical. This occurs at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (2Beutler B. Han J. Kruys V. Giroir B.P. Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors: The Molecules and Their Emerging Role in Medicine.

However, we still have a poor understanding of the precise regulatory events that are responsible for the rapid induction of high level TNF expression in human monocytes and macrophages during acute bacterial infection. lipopolysaccharide tumor necrosis factor-α nuclear factor κB nucleotide(s) polymerase chain reaction electrophoretic mobility shift assay polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. Much debate has centered on the role of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in transcriptional activation of the human TNF gene in monocytes. Although there is strong evidence that murine TNF expression is influenced by a number of NF-κB binding sites (14Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shakhov A. Collart M. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S. Jongeneel C. J. Exp.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 97-106PubMed Google Scholar), the situation in humans is less clear. Several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest that NF-κB could play an important role. A number of NF-κB-like binding motifs are located between the start of transcription of the TNF gene and the 3′ terminus of the lymphotoxin-α gene: they are here denoted κB1 (−873 to −864 nt), κB2 (−627 to −618 nt), κB2a (−598 to −589 nt), CK-1 (−213 to −204 nt (17Shannon M.F. Pell L.M. Lenardo M.J. Kuczek E.S. Occhiodoro F.S. Dunn S.M. Vadas M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2950-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), and κB3 (−98 to −89 nt). It is worth noting that site κB2 is 100% conserved between mouse, rabbit, and human TNF promoters (18Shakhov A.N. Kuprash D.V. Azizov M.M. Jongeneel C.V. Nedospasov S.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 95: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, LPS induces nuclear translocation of NF-κB in human monocytes, and LPS-inducible TNF expression is suppressed by specific inhibitors of NF-κB mobilization (19Haas J.G. Baeuerle P.A.

Weber C. Wedel A. Schreck R. Baeuerle P. Strobel M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6986-6993PubMed Google Scholar). However, studies of the role of NF-κB in the transcriptional activation of the human TNF gene have yielded a conflicting picture. Initial gene reporter studies suggested that NF-κB binding in the human TNF promoter region is of little functional importance when tested in the murine macrophage cell line P388D1 (5Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) or when analyzed in other contexts such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation of U937 (myeloblastoid) cells (4Economou J.S. Rhoades K. Essner R. McBride W.H. Gasson J.C. Morton D.L. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and K562 (erythroblastoid) cells (21Hensel G. Meichle A. Pfizenmaier K. Kronke M. Lymphokine Res. 1989; 8: 347-351PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies indicate that site κB3 contributes to transcriptional activation of the TNF gene by superantigen (6Trede N.S. Tsytsykova A.V. Chatila T. Goldfeld A.E. Geha R.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar) and cooperates with an adjacent cAMP-responsive element site to provide an enhancement of TNF transcription in LPS-stimulated human monocyte cell line THP-1 (13Yao J. Mackman N. Edington T.S. Fan S.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The present investigation focuses on the role of the other NF-κB binding sites, in particular the conserved site κB2 and its adjacent site κB2a. Several studies have shown that NF-κB-specific complexes are formed when site κB2a is tested against nuclear extracts from stimulated monocytes and macrophages (13Yao J. Mackman N. Edington T.S. Fan S.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 20Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Sternsdorf T. Liese J. Belohradsky B. Weber C. Wedel A.

Sci.). 1995; 342: 413-417PubMed Google Scholar), but there has been doubt about their functional importance. For example, reporter gene studies in human THP-1 cells concluded that the region containing κB2 and κB2a does not contribute to LPS inducibility, even though NF-κB-specific complexes were formed at the site κB2a with greater affinity than at the apparently functional site κB3 (13Yao J. Mackman N. Edington T.S. Fan S.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, a different picture emerged when reporter constructs containing the human TNF promoter region were transiently expressed in the murine macrophage line ANA-1. In this cell line, which resembles mature bone marrow macrophages, LPS inducibility was found to fall 5–10-fold as a result of deleting the region from −656 to −442 nt (22Udalova I.A. Turetskaya R.L. Kuprash D.V. Nedospasov S.A. Dokl. Acad. Nauk. (Proc. Russ. Acad. Sci.). 1995; 342: 413-417PubMed Google Scholar, 23Stuber F. Udalova I.A. Book M. Drutskaya L.N. Kuprash D.V. Turetskaya R.L. Schade F.U. Nedospasov S.A. J. Inflamm. 1996; 46: 42-50Google Scholar). These discrepant observations raise the intriguing possibility that the functional activity of the region around κB2 and κB2a has complex determinants that are specific not only for stimulus and cell type but for the stage of cell differentiation as discussed in Ref. 6Trede N.S. Tsytsykova A.V. Chatila T. Goldfeld A.E. Geha R.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar. Because the primary concern of the present study is the mechanism of LPS-induced TNF expression in human monocytes, here we have used Mono Mac 6, the human cell line whose surface markers and functional properties most closely resemble those of a mature monocyte (24Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Thiel E. Futterer A. Herzog V. Wirtz A. Riethmuller G. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In this cell line, we find that mutations in sites κB2 and κB2a sites have a more profound effect on LPS-inducible reporter gene expression than mutations at other NF-κB sites in the TNF promoter region. We further show that sites κB2 and κB2a flank a novel binding site, such that this 39-nt segment of DNA is capable of binding up to three NF-κB heterodimers plus an unknown constitutive factor(s). Each element of this cluster appears to contribute to transcriptional activation of the TNF gene. Human TNF promoter sequence (−1173 to +130 nt) derived from −1173-CAT construct (19Haas J.G. Baeuerle P.A. Riethmuller G. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9563-9567Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was used to generate the wild type TNF promoter construct wt (−1173)-pXP1 in eukaryotic expression vector pXP-1 (ATCC), and corresponding fragments with point mutations at sites κB2, κB2a and κB3 2D. Kuprash, I. Udalova, and S. A. Nedospasov, manuscript in preparation. were used to generate the mutant TNF promoter constructs κB2-mt-pXP1, κB2a-mt-pXP1, and κB3-mt-pXP1. A set of site-directed mutations at the ξ site, a mutation at site κB1, and +6 and +10 insertions between the sites κB2 and ξ were generated by PCR using −1173-CAT construct as a template and oligonucleotides bearing nucleotide substitutions: ξ-mt1 (F:agctCCGGGGaTccTTTCACTCCCCG; R:agctCGGGGAGTGAAAggAtCCCCGG); ξ-mt2 (F:agctCCGGGGGTGATTTggaTCCCCG; R:agctCGGGGAtccAAACACCCCCGG); ξ-mt3 (F:agctCCGGGGGGTGgaTcCACTCCCCG; R:agctCGGGGAGTGgAtcCACCCCCGG); 1-mt (F:agctGAGgATccGGACCCCCCCTTAA; R:agctTTAAGGGGGGGTCCggATcCTC); +6 (F:atggatccTCCCCGGGGCTGTCC; R:atggatccGTGAAATCACCCCCGGG); +10 (F:atggatccatTCCCCGGGGCTGTCC; R:atggatccatGTGAAATCACCCCCGGG) along with vector-specific primers HindIII (CTCGCCAAGCTTGGAAGAG) for F primer or KpnI (CACACCGGGTACCGTGCAC) for R primer. PCR products were cloned at HindIII/KpnI of pXP-1 vector. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Oligonucleotide probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): 1 (F: agctGAGTATGGGGACCCCCCCTTAA; R: agctTTAAGGGGGGGTCCCCATACTC); 2 (F: agctGGGTCTGTGAATTCCCGGGGGT; R: agctACCCCCGGGAATTCACAGACCC); 2a (F: agctTCCCCGGGGCTGTCCCAGGCTT; R: agctAAGCCTGGGACAGCCCCGGGGA); 3 (F: agctGCTCATGGGTTTCTCCACCAAG; R: agctCTTGGTGGAGAAACCCATGAGC); ξ (F: agctCCGGGGGTGATTTCACTCCCCG; R: agctCGGGGAGTGAAATCACCCCCGG); CK-1 (F: agctGTGTGAGGGGTATCCTTGATGC; R: agctGCATCAAGGATACCCCTCACAC); 2 mt (F: agctGGGTCTtTGAATTCCCGGGGGT; R: agctACCCCCGGGAATTCAaAGACCC); 2a mt (F: agctTCCCCGtaGCTGTCCCAGGCTT; R: agctAAGCCTGGGACAGCtaCGGGGA); 3 mt (F: agctGCTCATtaGTTTCTCCACCAAG; R: agctCTTGGTGGAGAAACtaATGAGC); and ξ-mt1, ξ-mt2, ξ-mt3, and 1-mt (as described above). Mono Mac 6 cells (10 × 106 to 20 × 106) were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 1 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (25Schreiber E. Matthias P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). The binding reaction contained 12 mmHEPES, pH 7.8, 80–100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 12% glycerol, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear extracts (1–4 μg) or recombinant proteins (10–50 ng) were mixed in an 8-μl reaction with 0.2–0.5 ng of labeled probe (1–5 × 104 cpm) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis in a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE buffer. For supershift analysis, the reaction mixture was preincubated with appropriate antiserum (Santa Cruz) at room temperature for 5–10 min prior to addition of the labeled probe. Indicated gels were quantified using the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The binding reaction was performed with radiolabeled oligoduplex corresponding to the site ξ in which three central dT nucleotides were substituted with bromodeoxyuridine. The EMSA gel was UV illuminated at 302 nm for 30 min at 4 °C and exposed to autoradiography for 2–4 h at the same temperature. The region corresponding to the DNA-protein complex was excised, and the proteins were eluted in 2× SDS buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol) at 37 °C overnight. They were further processed either for SDS-PAGE or for immunoprecipitation as described (26Hansen S.K. Nerlov C. Zabel U. Verde P. Johnsen M. Baeuerle P. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide 2-F (or 2a-R) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) and used as primer in a PCR along with 2a-R (or 2-F). The PCR fragment obtained (5 × 105 cpm) was gel purified and partially methylated in 200 μl of buffer containing 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA by adding 1 μl of dimethyl sulfate at room temperature for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 40 μl of stop solution (1.5 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 1m β-mercaptoethanol). DNA was precipitated and washed several times. The conditions of recombinant protein-DNA binding reactions were the same as for EMSA but scaled up 5–10 times. Bound and free DNAs were eluted overnight at 37 °C in 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA. The DNA was purified and dissolved in 90 μl of H2O, 10 μl of piperidine was added, and the sample was incubated at 90 °C for 30 min and cooled on dry ice. Traces of piperidine were removed by three cycles of evaporation. Cleaved DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis using a 13% sequencing gel. Solid phase DNase I footprinting was carried out using the methodology described previously (27Sandaltzopoulos R. Becker P.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). DNA probes were generated by PCR amplification using biotinylated primer TNF-480 (TTGAGTCCTGAGGCCTGTGT) along with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled primer TNF-680 (GCATTATGAGTCTCCGGGTC) or vice versa. Following gel purification, radiolabeled DNA probe was adsorbed onto magnetic Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2–4 × 104 cpm of bead-DNA probe was incubated with 5–20 μg of nuclear extracts in 160 μl of binding buffer at room temperature for 20 min. Following addition of 160 μl of salt mixture (10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmCaCl2) 0.06–0.25 units DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 30 s. An equal volume of STOP solution was added (0.5 m NaCl, 40 mm EDTA, 1% SDS), and digested DNA was recovered using the Magnetic Particle Concentrator (Dynal). DNA was washed with 200 μl of solution I (2 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA) followed by 200 μl of solution II (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) twice. The reaction was analyzed on 7% sequencing gel. Where indicated autoradiograms were recorded digitally using the UVP Image Store 5000 system (UVP Life Sciences, Cambridge, UK) and analyzed with NIH Image 1.6 software (public domain). The protein sequences corresponding to amino acids 2–400 of human p50 and amino acids 2–306 of human p65 were recovered by PCR using the appropriate primers. p50 and p65Δ cDNAs were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET32a (Novagen) and used to transform BL21(DE3)LysS bacterial strain. Cultures were grown toA600 = 0.4–0.6, induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma), and then grown for an additional 3 h before harvesting. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 70 mm NaCl and lysed by three sonication cycles. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and cleared lysate was absorbed to biotin-labeled oligoduplex corresponding to consensus NF-κB binding sequence bound to streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) for 30–60 min at room temperature. The agarose beads were washed twice with buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl, and the bound protein was eluted with buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl. To form p65Δ/p50 heterodimer, cleared lysates containing equal amounts of recombinant p50 and p65Δ were mixed and denatured by adding urea to 8 m, followed by step dialysis against buffer A containing 70 mm NaCl and 6, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, or 0 m urea. The heterodimer was purified from total extract as described above. The purity and concentration of recombinant proteins were assessed on SDS-PAGE gel. Mono Mac 6 cells were maintained as described previously (24Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Thiel E. Futterer A. Herzog V. Wirtz A. Riethmuller G. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed on Mono Mac 6 cells by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (15Shakhov A. Collart M. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S. Jongeneel C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in fresh medium at 5 × 105/ml 24 h prior to transfection. The concentration of DEAE-dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) used was 100 μg/ml. After transfection cells were incubated for 24 h prior to LPS activation (1 μg/ml) and for a further 6–12 h before harvesting. Luciferase assay was performed using the Luciferase assay system and Turner Luminometer model 20 (Promega) according to the protocol supplied. To examine whether LPS-inducible specific DNA-protein complexes can be formed at NF-κB-like sites within the human TNF promoter region in human monocytes, oligonucleotide duplexes spanning these sites were tested in EMSA with nuclear extracts from unstimulated and LPS-stimulated Mono Mac 6 cells. LPS stimulation resulted in formation of NF-κB/Rel-specific complexes at sites κB1, κB2, κB2a, and κB3, although they differed considerably in intensity (Fig.1). Because no NF-κB/Rel-specific complexes were formed at site CK-1 (data not shown), this site was excluded from further analysis. The strongest binding was observed at site κB1, which formed two NF-κB-specific complexes corresponding to p50/p50 homodimer (I) and p65/p50 heterodimer (II), respectively, as defined by using NF-κB/Rel-specific antibodies (data not shown). The binding at the sites κB2 and κB2a was about three times weaker, and the complex formed at site κB3 was at the limit of detection (>10 times weaker than that at site κB1). To examine the role of each site in LPS-inducible transcriptional activation, we generated a set of reporter constructs with 1.2 kilobase pairs of TNF promoter sequence placed in front of a luciferase reporter gene. Point mutations were created at each of the NF-κB binding sites, using specific mutations that disrupted the formation of NF-κB/Rel-specific complexes when tested by EMSA as above (data not shown). When these constructs were expressed in Mono Mac 6 cells, mutation at site κB1 had little effect on LPS-inducible luciferase activity, whereas mutation at site κB2 or site κB2a resulted in a significant decrease of luciferase activity (approximately 50% reduction of the wild type construct), and mutation at site κB3 had a lesser effect (15–20%) (Fig. 2). Thus, despite the fact that κB1 site appears to have a higher affinity to NF-κB/Rel proteins, sites κB2 and κB2a appear to have a greater effect on transcriptional activation of the TNF gene in Mono Mac 6 cells. To explore DNA-protein interactions around the κB2 and κB2a sites, we performed DNase I footprinting analysis of a segment spanning −680 to −480 nt using nuclear extracts prepared from Mono Mac 6 cells before or after LPS stimulation. Nuclear extracts made after LPS stimulation gave protection from DNase I cleavage at sites κB2 and κB2a and also in the intervening region spanning −616 to −599 nt (Fig.3 A). Nuclear extracts made before LPS stimulation also gave protection in this region when tested at high concentrations. A similar pattern of protection was observed using the noncoding strand (Fig. 3 B). This observation raised the possibility of a novel binding site between κB2 and κB2a, but it was also possible that the area of protection in between κB2 and κB2a might be because of conformational changes brought about by occupancy of the κB2 and κB2a sites. To examine this question, the above experiments were repeated with DNA bearing specific mutations in κB2, κB2a, or the intervening sequence. Each mutation was found to cause a site-specific alteration in the DNase I footprint (Fig. 3 C). That is, mutation of site κB2 abolished the protection of site κB2 (but not of κB2a or the intervening sequence), whereas mutation of κB2a abolished the protection of κB2a (but not of κB2 or the intervening sequence), and mutation of the intervening sequence abolished the protection of the intervening sequence (but not of κB2 or κB2a) (Fig.3 D). We therefore proceeded to characterize the putative novel binding site, here termed ξ, situated in the 19-nt gap between sites κB2 and κB2a. To examine the binding properties of ξ we used an oligonucleotide duplex matching the sequences from −619 to −597 nt as a probe for EMSA. Nuclear extracts were obtained from Mono Mac 6 cells that had been stimulated with LPS (Fig. 4 A). For comparison, the binding complexes observed with probes specific for sites κB2 and κB2a are shown. Unstimulated nuclear extracts gave a single major complex with the probe for site ξ. After stimulation this constitutive complex increased in intensity, and on close inspection, a separate sharp band appeared at its lower margin. The latter inducible complex was at maximal intensity between 15 and 120 min after stimulation (data not shown). These data raised the question of whether the novel site might bind two different factors, one constitutively present and the other rapidly inducible in Mono Mac 6 cells. A further EMSA investigated the specificity of these complexes by competition with various unlabeled oligonucleotide duplexes. The constitutive complex was abolished by competition with 100× itself but not by 100× excess of oligoduplexes corresponding to site κB2 or κB2a (data not shown). In contrast the sharp band of the inducible complex appeared to be inhibited by competition with κB2 or κB2a at least as effectively as by itself. Competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide duplex corresponding to an EGR-1 binding site had little effect on constitutive or inducible complex formation. These results suggested that constitutive and inducible factors interacting with site ξ are of different origin and that the latter might be related to the NF-κB/Rel family. The distinction between constitutive and inducible binding was also illustrated by the different effects of specific alterations to the ξ sequence (Fig. 4 B). A substitution of GTGA → ATCC at −611 to −608 nt disrupted both constitutive and inducible binding. Interestingly, an ATTT → GATC substitution at −608 to −605 nt had no effect on inducible binding but abolished constitutive binding. Conversely, these data suggest that a CAC → GGA substitution at −604 to −602 nt might reduce constitutive binding less completely than inducible binding. The rapid kinetics of the inducible complex suggested the involvement of transcription factor(s) that do not need to be synthesized de novo. Because NF-κB provides a classical example of this and because ξ includes a sequence (GTGATTTCAC) that has two mismatches with the consensus NF-κB site (GGGPuNNPyCCC, where Pu is purine and Py is pyrimidine), we considered the possibility of an inducible complex being formed by NF-κB proteins. Two items of circumstantial evidence are given above. First, the LPS-inducible complex at ξ had similar mobility to the complexes at κB2 and κB2a, which are known to bind p65/p50 (Fig. 4 A). Second, the LPS-inducible complex at ξ was inhibited by competition with the p65/p50 binding sequences of sites κB2 and κB2a (data not shown). As a more formal test of this question, we performed an EMSA using specific antibodies against two members of the NF-κB/Rel family, p65 and p50. Both antibodies markedly diminished the inducible complex, whereas the antibodies against another member of the family, c-Rel, and against transcription factor EGR-1 had no effect on this complex (Fig.5). Taken together, these results identify a major inducible complex formed at site ξ as p65/p50 NF-κB heterodimer. Because the various members of the NF-κB/Rel family possess different functional properties, we used recombinant forms of p50 and p65 to examine the possibility that each part of the κB2/ξ/κB2a cluster might preferentially recruit a specific type of NF-κB complex. The recombinant p65 was truncated at amino acid 306 to facilitate bacterial expression and is denoted p65Δ; this truncation does not affect the DNA-binding domain. The results of methylation interference are shown in Fig.6. It can be seen that p50 homodimers protect site κB2a much more strongly than site κB2, whereas the opposite is true for p65Δ homodimers. Site ξ is weakly protected by p50 homodimers but poorly protected by p65Δ homodimers. All three sites are protected by p65Δ/p50 heterodimers. To provide an indication of relative binding affinity, radiolabeled oligoduplexes corresponding to sites κB2, κB2a, or ξ were titrated against a standard amount of p50/p50, p65Δ/p65Δ, or p65Δ/p50. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by EMSA and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Fig.7 A). These data confirm that p50 homodimers bind much more strongly to κB2a than to κB2 or ξ, whereas p65Δ homodimers bind much more strongly to κB2 than to κB2a or ξ. However the binding of p65Δ/p50 heterodimers showed less variation between the three sites, being strongest for κB2a and weakest for site ξ. In view of the similar affinity of p65Δ/p50 for each of the three adjacent binding sites, the question arises whether the heterodimer can bind at all three sites simultaneously. When recombinant p65Δ/p50 heterodimer was incubated with an oligoduplex corresponding to the full κB2/ξ/κB2a cluster, EMSA revealed a ladder of three complexes (Fig. 7 B) in contrast to the single complexes seen for the individual binding sites. This appearance is consistent with the hypothesis that the cluster is capable of binding one, two, or three heterodimers simultaneously. To"
https://openalex.org/W2117022734,"Protein kinase CK2 is an ubiquitous and pleiotropic Ser/Thr protein kinase composed of two catalytic (α and/or α′) and two noncatalytic (β) subunits forming a heterotetrameric holoenzyme involved in cell growth and differentiation. Here we report the identification, cloning, and oncogenic activity of the murine CK2α′ subunit. Serum treatment of quiescent mouse fibroblasts induces CK2α′ mRNA expression, which peaks at 4 h. The kinetics ofCK2α′ expression correlate with increased kinase activity toward a specific CK2 holoenzyme peptide substrate. The ectopic expression of CK2α′ (or CK2α) cooperates with Ha-ras in foci formation of rat primary embryo fibroblasts. Moreover, we observed that BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts transformed with Ha-ras and CK2α′ show a faster growth rate than cells transformed with Ha-rasalone. In these cells the higher growth rate correlates with an increase in calmodulin phosphorylation, a protein substrate specifically affected by isolated CK2 catalytic subunits but not by CK2 holoenzyme, suggesting that unbalanced expression of a CK2 catalytic subunit synergizes with Ha-ras in cell transformation. Protein kinase CK2 is an ubiquitous and pleiotropic Ser/Thr protein kinase composed of two catalytic (α and/or α′) and two noncatalytic (β) subunits forming a heterotetrameric holoenzyme involved in cell growth and differentiation. Here we report the identification, cloning, and oncogenic activity of the murine CK2α′ subunit. Serum treatment of quiescent mouse fibroblasts induces CK2α′ mRNA expression, which peaks at 4 h. The kinetics ofCK2α′ expression correlate with increased kinase activity toward a specific CK2 holoenzyme peptide substrate. The ectopic expression of CK2α′ (or CK2α) cooperates with Ha-ras in foci formation of rat primary embryo fibroblasts. Moreover, we observed that BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts transformed with Ha-ras and CK2α′ show a faster growth rate than cells transformed with Ha-rasalone. In these cells the higher growth rate correlates with an increase in calmodulin phosphorylation, a protein substrate specifically affected by isolated CK2 catalytic subunits but not by CK2 holoenzyme, suggesting that unbalanced expression of a CK2 catalytic subunit synergizes with Ha-ras in cell transformation. Protein kinase CK2 (previously known as casein kinase II) is an ubiquitous Ser/Thr kinase present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (for review, see Refs. 1Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 2Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv.

CK2 holoenzyme consists of two catalytic (α and/or α′) and two regulatory (β) subunits assembled as stable heterotetramers, which in vitro do not dissociate unless under denaturing conditions. CK2 is unique among Ser/Thr protein kinases for its ability to use GTP, besides ATP, as phosphate donor and for its unusual site specificity, which is determined by multiple acidic and/or previously phosphorylated residues downstream (n+3) from the phosphoacceptor amino acid, determining the minimum consensus (S/T-X-X-E/D/Yp/Sp) (6Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar). More than 160 cellular proteins have been reported to be phosphorylated by CK2, and several are implicated in signal transduction, transcriptional activation, cell cycle progression, and cell differentiation. The nuclear proteins that are CK2 substrates includes: c-Myc (7Luscher B. Kuenzel E.A. Krebs E.G. Eisenman R.N.

In mammalian cells phosphorylation of nuclear factors dependent on CK2 could be relevant for cell growth regulation and the progression into the cell cycle. A direct role of CK2 activity in cell cycle progression has been demonstrated by antibody-mediated CK2 depletion and by gene inactivation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (14Pepperkok R. Lorenz P. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6986-6991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although hundreds of papers have been published on the subject, it is still unknown how the enzyme is regulated in vivo (4Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 5Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar,16Litchfield D.W. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 373-381PubMed Google Scholar). CK2β undergoes stoichiometric autophosphorylation and both CK2β and CK2α (but not CK2α′) are phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by p34Cdc2 kinase (17Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these phosphorylations do not correlate with any regulation of activity. Moreover, it is not clear whether the holoenzyme represents an up- or a down-regulated form of the kinase, because some substrates are preferentially phosphorylated by the tetramer, but others, like calmodulin, are phosphorylated only by the free catalytic subunits (6Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar). In transgenic mice it was possible to demonstrate that in T cells the overexpression of the catalytic CK2α subunit enhanced the onset of lymphomas induced by either c-myc ortal-1 (18Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 19Kelliher M.A. Seldin D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5160-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These results shed new light on the previous observations that cattle infected by the parasite Theileria parva developed T cell lymphomas, because parasite-infected cells show increased CK2 activity (20ole-MoiYoi O.K. Sugimoto C. Conrad P.A. Macklin M.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6193-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21ole-MoiYoi O.K. Brown W.C. Iams K.P. Nayar A. Tsukamoto T.

Opposite results were obtained by the overexpression of CK2α in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. In these cells CK2α overexpression resulted in deactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and suppression of ras-dependent cell transformation (23Hériché J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To identify genes potentially involved in cell growth, we performed a differential screening for the isolation of transcripts induced by mitogenic stimuli within the G1 phase. Here we report the identification and cloning of the murine lower molecular weight catalytic subunit, CK2α′. We observed that in mouse fibroblasts CK2α′ is induced by serum treatment as a slow-early gene. Together with CK2α′ alsoCK2α and CK2β are induced. Cotransfection of an expression vector containing CK2α′ together with a vector expressing Ha-ras induced foci formation in rat primary embryo fibroblasts. Moreover, ras-transformed BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing CK2α′ showed a faster growth rate than cells transformed with Ha-ras alone. ras-Transformed fibroblasts overexpressingCK2α′ also exibited increased phosphorylating activity toward calmodulin, which is a specific substrate of CK2 catalytic subunits. These findings suggest that unbalanced expression of eitherCK2α′ or CK2α plays a role in fibroblast cell transformation. NIH 3T3 and BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts were grown at 37 °C in DMEM 1The abbreviations used are: DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumPCRpolymerase chain reactionPBSphosphate-buffered saline. supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, penicillin-streptomycin, and glutamine. The cells were expanded by trypsin-EDTA treatment and subcultured at a ratio of 1:3 every 2–3 days. Rat embryo fibroblasts were isolated as described previously (24Oliviero S. Robinson G. Struhl K. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, 14-day CDF(F344) rat embryos were sacrificed, rinsed, and trypsinized for 30 min at 37 °C. DMEM containing 10% FCS was added, and the cells were centrifuged, dispersed, counted, and plated on 100-mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 2 × 106/dish. After 48 h the cells were trypsinized, and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline. To induce a relatively quiescent cell population, subconfluent NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated for 48 h in DMEM plus 0.5% FCS. Cells were then treated for 2 and 4 h with DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the guanidinium thiocyanate method (25Chomzyski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar) from quiescent and serum-treated fibroblasts and subjected to the differential display technique as described previously (26Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4689) Google Scholar, 27Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The amplified cDNA fragments were compared in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. A serum-induced cDNA fragment, named L-0401, was excised, recovered by boiling, reamplified, and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). The L-0401 cDNA fragment (230 bp), whose corresponding mRNA was homologous to humanCK2α′, was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random primer labeling and used to screen a mouse fibroblast cDNA library (27Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The positive clones, inserted into the pBluescript SK vector, were sequenced on both strands either automatically using a Perkin-Elmer model 373 DNA sequencer or manually using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp). A positive clone, named pBS38α′ (FS304), contained the full-length mouse CK2α′ cDNA. Total RNA (10 μg) was run on denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide to verify that each lane contained similar amounts of undegraded rRNA. RNA was transferred onto nylon membranes and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Filters were hybridized with 32P-labeled probes and washed as described (27Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The mouse CK2α′ probe was obtained from the full-length cDNA (pBS38α′). The cDNA fragments of murine CK2α (base pairs 421–841) andCK2β (base pairs 912–1321) were obtained by cDNA amplification of a mouse fibroblast cDNA library (27Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used for amplification (5′-GCTTCGATATGACCGTCACG-3′ and 5′-GACTCAACTACTAAATCCG-3′ forCK2α and 5′-GTACCAGCAGGGAGACTTTGGCTAC-3′ and 5′-CATAGACTTCCTGAAAGGGTGGCAG-3′ for CK2β), were obtained from EBI Nucleotide Sequence Data Base under accession numberU17112 for CK2α and X56502 for CK2β. The amplified cDNA fragments were sequenced, labeled with [32P]dCTP, and used in Northern blot. CK2α′ open reading frame (from P-2 to R-350) was amplified by PCR from pBS38α′ with a 5′ primer containing a BamHI restriction site (5′-CGCGGATCCCGGCCCGGCCGCG-3′) and a 3′ primer containing aKpnI restriction site (5′-CGGGGTACCTCATCGTGCTGCGGT-3′). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and KpnI and cloned into the BamHI/KpnI site of a bacterial expression vector (FS310) made by subcloning theXbaI/XhoI fragment of pQE-31 (Qiagen) into theXbaI/XhoI site of pBluescript SK to give pQEBSα′ (FS311). The construct expressing murine CK2α′ under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, pcDNAα′, was made by subcloning a StuI/partialXhoI-digested fragment from pBS38α′ into theEcoRV/XhoI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). To obtain murine CK2α under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, the 5′ end of CK2α was amplified by PCR from pT7–7CKIIα (28Bodenbach L. Fauss J. Robitzki A. Krehan A. Lorenz P. Lozeman F.J. Pyerin W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with a 5′ primer containing aHindIII restriction site and an optimal Kozak sequence (29Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar) (5′-GAGAAAGCTTCCACCGCCATGTCGGGACCCGTGCC-3′) and a 3′ primer downstream from an XhoI restriction site (5′-CTTGATTTCCCCATTCCACC-3′). The PCR product was digested with HindIII andXhoI and cloned into the HindIII/XhoI site of pcDNA3 to give pcDNAα5′ (MO339). AXhoI/blunt-ended HindIII fragment, corresponding to the 3′ end of CK2α, was released from pT7–7CKIIα and subcloned into the XhoI/blunt-ended ApaI site of pcDNAα5′ to give pcDNAα (MO346). All constructs were sequenced on both strands. Subconfluent cells were fed with culture medium 1–2 h before transfection. Cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of activated Ha-ras and 10 μg of each construct for 8 h by standard CaPO4 precipitation procedures (24Oliviero S. Robinson G. Struhl K. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Where necessary vector plasmid (pcDNA3) was added to reach the total amount of 15 μg of DNA per transfected plate. At least two different cesium chloride DNA preparations of each construct were independently transfected. The cells were rinsed with PBS and re-fed with culture medium 15 h posttransfection. The cells were trypsinized 24 h after transfection and split 1:3. When the cells reached confluence they were re-fed with DMEM containing 2% FCS, and the medium was changed every 2 days. Stable cell transformants were visible after 7–10 days. Individual foci from BALB/c 3T3 cells transformed by Ha-ras or by Ha-ras plusCK2α′ were picked and examined for their growth properties. For growth rate analysis cells were plated in duplicate at 1 × 105 cells on 60-mm Petri dishes in DMEM plus 2% FCS. Cells were counted every day using a hemacytometer and the medium was changed every 3 days. For tumor growth assays, 106cells in midlog-phase growth were harvested, washed with PBS, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and injected subcutaneously into the scapular region of BALB/c nude mice. After 2 weeks of growth, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were surgically removed and weighed. Whole-cell extracts were prepared by rinsing cultures grown on Petri dishes with PBS followed by harvesting with a rubber policeman. Cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.05% Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used in phosphorylation assays. Phosphorylation experiments were performed by incubating the substrate (200 μm peptide RRRADDSDDDDD or 10 μmcalmodulin) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 μm [γ-32P]dATP for 10 min at 37 °C. NaCl was omitted when calmodulin was used as substrate. The reaction was stopped by cooling in ice followed, in the case of calmodulin, by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, staining with Coomassie Blue and either autoradiographed or directly scanned on Instant Imager Apparatus (Canberra-Packard). 32P incorporated into the peptide substrate was evaluated by the phosphocellulose paper procedure (30Glass D.B. Masaracchia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In cultured mouse fibroblasts growth factor depletion leads the cell to exit from the cell cycle and become quiescent. Serum treatment induces re-entry into the cell cycle, which is likely because of the induction of early genes. To identify new serum-induced genes, we used the mRNA differential display technique (26Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4689) Google Scholar, 27Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were serum-starved for 48 h and the RNAs were collected either from starved cells or from cells treated with serum at different time points. Several cDNAs, obtained only from serum-induced cells, were amplified and sequenced. Comparison of the cDNA fragments with the EBI Nucleotide Sequence Data Base revealed that a cDNA induced at 4 h after serum treatment was highly similar to the human protein kinase CK2α′. To clone the full-length cDNA coding for CK2α′, a mouse fibroblast cDNA library (27Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11675-11680Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) was screened. The few positive clones were sequenced using internal sequencing primers, and the nucleotide sequence of one clone of 1877 base pairs in length revealed a single open reading frame coding for a putative protein of 350 amino acid residues. The mouse and human predicted protein products shared 98.9% amino acid identity. The strong similarity of the murine CK2α′ deduced protein sequence with its corresponding human homologue suggests a highly conserved function of CK2α′. Murine CK2α′ protein shows a lower degree of identity with CK2α. The two proteins share 82.4% identity over 347 amino acids overlap (Fig.1). The greatest difference is in the C-terminal domains, because the deduced CK2α′ protein sequence is 41 amino acids shorter and thus lacks the p34Cdc2 sites phosphorylated during the cell cycle (17Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CK2α′ also lacks the HEHRKL amino acid residues (166–171 of CK2α) that have been implicated in the interaction with protein phosphatase 2A (23Hériché J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To confirm that the cDNA encoded a biologically active CK2α′ enzyme we expressed the cDNA in Escherichia coli.Recombinant CK2α′ showed a molecular mass of about 41 kDa consistent with the predicted size of the protein, and the nondenatured soluble bacterial extract containing the immunoreactive CK2α′ was able to phosphorylate the CK2 peptide substrate RRRADDSDDDDD in vitro (not shown). CK2 is an ubiquitously expressed protein kinase essential for cell growth. Northern blot analysis with a CK2α′ probe revealed two hybridizing transcripts of 2.2 and 4.2 kilobases, respectively. The expression of CK2α′ mRNA is relatively constant in all tissues with the exception of testis where a much stronger CK2α′ signal was detected (Fig.2). These results contrast with CK2α expression, which is abundant in brain and barely expressed in testis (31Meisner H. Heller-Harrison R. Buxton J. Czech M.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4072-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, CK2α andCK2α′ are differentially regulated in these tissues. The identification of CK2α′ in a screening for mRNAs induced by serum treatment of quiescent fibroblasts suggested that this gene is induced by mitogenic stimuli. To measure the induction of the CK2α′ transcript, we performed Northern blot analysis on CK2α′ mRNA in fibroblasts before and after serum treatment. As can be observed in Fig. 3 A the CK2α′ mRNA was low in quiescent fibroblasts and increased about 50% in serum-induced fibroblasts, with a peak induction at 4 h. The quantitative analysis of the transcripts normalized to the glyceraldheyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels is reported in Fig. 3 B. The serum-induced increase in CK2α′ transcripts was not blocked by the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, as shown by the superinduction ofCK2α′ mRNA (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, in mouse fibroblasts CK2α′ is induced with slow kinetics by serum treatment, and this induction is independent of protein synthesis. Because protein kinase CK2 is a tetramer containing two catalytic and two regulatory subunits, we also tested whether the mRNA corresponding to CK2α and CK2β were induced by serum treatment of quiescent cells. Northern blot analysis of CK2α revealed three hybridizing transcripts of 1.6, 3.1, and 4.6 kilobases, respectively. The CK2α mRNA showed a less pronounced but detectable increase at 2 h after serum treatment. Similar to CK2α′ the CK2αmRNA increase was not blocked by the inhibition of protein synthesis. Northern blot analysis with the probe for CK2βrevealed a single transcript of 1.2 kilobases that increased with the same kinetic of CK2α′, and cycloheximide treatment did not influence its induction. The mRNA analysis showed a moderate but measurable induction of the CK2 subunits. To confirm the functional significance of this induction, we determined whether the increased mRNA levels corresponded to an increase of CK2 by testing the kinase activity of the whole-cell extracts from quiescent and serum-induced cells, using the phosphorylation assay with the CK2 peptide substrate. The time course of the serum-induced CK2 activity showed a maximal increase of about 1.8-fold at 4 h compared with quiescent cells (Fig.3 C). To confirm that the activity monitored with the peptide substrate is because of CK2, the effect of heparin, a specific CK2 inhibitor, was examined. The phosphorylation of the peptide was entirely suppressed by 1 μg/ml heparin as expected for CK2-catalyzed phosphorylation (not shown). The above results showed that mouse fibroblasts respond to mitogenic stimuli with an increase of CK2 transcripts and kinase activity at the G0/G1 phase transition. Although the induction observed is not dramatic, we measured a reproducible increase of CK2 activity of about 80%. Previous experiments showed that as little as a 10% increase inCK2α expression in lymphoid organs of transgenic mice accelerated the onset of lymphomas induced by either c-mycor tal-1 oncogenes (18Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 19Kelliher M.A. Seldin D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5160-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To test whetherCK2α′ or CK2α play a direct role in tumor induction, we performed standard focus formation assay transfecting primary rat embryo fibroblasts with Ha-ras,CK2α′, or CK2α alone; the combination of Ha-ras with each catalytic subunit. Neither Ha-ras alone nor the CK2 catalytic subunits transfected independently induced foci formation in primary cells (Table I). However, transformed foci were visible within 10 days in the plates cotransfected with Ha-ras and either CK2α′ or CK2α. We therefore conclude that either CK2α′ orCK2α cooperate with oncogenic ras in primary cell transformation.Table ITransformation of primary rat embryo fibroblastsTransfected constructNumber of foci/100-mm dishHa-ras0CK2α′0CK2α0c-fos0Ha-ras +CK2α′68 ± 9Ha-ras + CK2α75 ± 10Ha-ras + c-fos95 ± 10A standard focus assay was used to assess the ability of various constructs to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts.

Open table in a new tab A standard focus assay was used to assess the ability of various constructs to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts. The number of foci were counted after crystal violet staining. The experiments were repeated four times, and the average foci number with their S.E. are listed. To study further the effect ofCK2α′ expression on the growth rate ofras-transformed cells, we compared the growth behavior of mouse fibroblasts transformed either with Ha-ras alone or with Ha-ras and CK2α′. For this experiment we chose immortalized mouse fibroblasts, because these cells can be transformed with Ha-ras alone, and therefore it is possible to obtain transformed clones either expressing or not ectopicCK2α′. BALB/c 3T3 were used for this set of experiments, because the efficiency of NIH 3T3 transformation with Ha-rasalone was too high, making it difficult to quantitate the effects ofCK2α′. As shown in Fig.4 A in BALB/c 3T3 cells the cotransfection of CK2α′ and Ha-ras resulted in approximately a 3-fold higher number of foci compared with the number of foci induced by Ha-ras alone. Moreover, we observed that foci generated with Ha-ras alone were smaller than those from clones transformed with Ha-ras and CK2α′, suggesting that overexpression of CK2α′ contributed to the cell growth of transformed cells (Fig. 4 B). In parallel sets of experiments we observed a similar effect following cotransfection of Ha-ras with the CK2α catalytic subunit. The transfection of CK2α′, or CK2α, alone did not induce foci formation (not shown). To analyze in more detail the growth rate of the transformed clones, four ras-transformed clones (R-1 to R-4) and fourras-CK2α′-transformed clones (Rα′-1 to Rα′-4) were chosen for further analysis. Fig.5 A shows the growth curves obtained by counting cells over a period of 5 days. The clones obtained by cotransfection of Ha-ras and CK2α′ showed a marked increase in their growth rates compared withras-transformed clones. Eight other clones obtained from different transfections were analyzed, and those cotransfected withCK2α′ and Ha-ras also exhibited increased growth rates (not shown). To examine whether the growth differences correlated with the increased expression of CK2α′ in the transformed clones, we tested the kinase activity mediated by CK2α′ by measuring the phosphorylation of calmodulin. Calmodulin is an ideal substrate for examining the contributions of the CK2 catalytic subunits, because in reconstitution experiments with recombinant subunits its phosphorylation is suppressed completely by adding CK2β (5Pinna L.A.

Clones, transformed with both Ha-ras and CK2α′, showed higher levels of calmodulin phosphorylation when compared withras-transformed clones (Fig. 5 B). This growth-related phosphorylation of calmodulin was inhibited (>90%) by addition of either a molar excess (0.5 mm) of the specific peptide substrate, or 1 μg/ml heparin (not shown). These findings, in conjunction with the alkalilability of the phosphate incorporated into calmodulin, which rules out the possibility of tyrosine phosphorylation, show that calmodulin phosphorylation is entirely because of CK2 rather than to any other protein kinase(s). Thus, although we observed clonal variability, the enhanced growth correlated with increased CK2α′-dependent calmodulin phosphorylation (Fig. 5 C). Finally, in mice we tested the growth of Ha-ras versus Ha-ras plusCK2α′-transformed clones. Exponentially growing transformed clones were collected and injected subcutaneously into the scapular region of nude mice, and the resultant tumors were removed surgically after 2 weeks of growth and weighed. Consistent with the results from the cell growth in vitro, CK2α′ was found to produce a significant enhancement of tumor growth (Fig.5 D). Here we report the cloning of the murine CK2α′ subunit and show that its mRNA and kinase activity are induced in response to serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts. Furthermore, we show that expression of CK2α′ under the control of a constitutive promoter cooperates with Ha-ras in transformation of rat primary fibroblasts and increases cell growth of transformed cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our study originated from a screening for serum-induced messages in quiescent mouse fibroblasts, which allowed us to identify theCK2α′ as an induced gene. We therefore cloned the murine full-length CK2α′ cDNA, analyzed its expression pattern in vivo, in vitro, and activity in cultured cells. Northern blot analysis showed a CK2α′ peak of induction at 4 h after serum treatment and that this induction does not require new protein synthesis. Therefore CK2α′, like c-myc and MCP-1 (Refs. 36Kelly K. Cochran B.H. Stiles C.D. Leder P. Cell. 1983; 35: 603-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 37Muller R. Bravo R.

The analysis of induction revealed a lower but still measurable increase of both CK2α and CK2β at the same time points, suggesting that newly assembled CK2 tetramers can be formed following serum induction. In accordance with this prediction we observed an increased CK2-dependent phosphorylation activity in protein extracts from serum-induced cells. An active role of CK2 in cell cycle progression has already been suggested both in mammalian cells and yeast (14Pepperkok R. Lorenz P. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6986-6991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol.

Our data show, for the first time, that CK2 activity is indeed increased at the boundary between G0 and G1, suggesting that new CK2 synthesis is required at this stage of the cell cycle. Its specific induction could be necessary for several reasons. It is possible that the kinase already present in the cells is in a form which is not able to phosphorylate some critical substrates. Alternatively, because we observed a higher CK2α′ induction compared with the other catalytic subunit, a higher proportion of α′2β2 or α′αβ2 tetramers could be formed. The formation of these two types of tetramer may lead to different substrate specificity. Despite the fact that the catalytic properties of isolated recombinant CK2α and CK2α′ are very similar (28Bodenbach L. Fauss J. Robitzki A. Krehan A. Lorenz P. Lozeman F.J. Pyerin W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Antonelli M. Daniotti J.L. Rojo D. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which is consistent with their high sequence homology in their catalytic domains, significant structural differences suggest divergent functional commitments. Thus, the C-terminal segment of vertebrate CK2α, which lies outside the catalytic core and includes several phosphorylation sites affected both in vitro andin vivo by cyclin-dependent kinases, is absent in CK2α′ (17Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise a motif (HEHRKL) responsible for association of CK2α with protein phosphatase 2A (23Hériché J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) is substantially altered in CK2α′ (HQQKKL). This difference is especially remarkable as it occurs inside a region that is otherwise highly conserved between CK2α and CK2α′. Suggestive of specific function(s) of CK2α′ in higher organisms is the observation that CK2α′ could not be detected inDrosophila, Xenopus, andSchizosaccharomyces pombe. In S. cerevisiae,however, a somewhat atypical CK2α′ subunit is found that exhibits functional differences from CK2α (39Rethinaswamy A. Birnbaum M.J. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5869-5877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 40Glover C.V.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 95-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). CK2α′ cooperates with oncogenic ras in the transformation of primary fibroblasts. Our data show that neither CK2 catalytic subunits nor Ha-ras alone induce foci formation when transfected in primary cells, whereas transformed foci become evident upon cotransfection with Ha-ras and eitherCK2α′ or CK2α. Therefore, we can conclude that although the structural differences between CK2α and CK2α′ may reflect distinct functional roles, at least with respect to the cooperation with ras in cell transformation, these differences are not critical. Recently, it was observed that exogenous expression ofCK2α suppressed cell growth and inhibited foci formation induced by activated ras (23Hériché J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Our results diverge from this observation. The reasons for such a discrepancy are presently unclear. It is possible that the inhibitory effect of CK2αpreviously observed (23Hériché J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) was dependent on the genetic background of the NIH 3T3 cells used in those experiments. Alternatively, the reduction of foci observed by Hériché and collaborators (23Hériché J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) may have resulted from a CK2α poisoning effect because of a too high expression of CK2α. In a standard focus formation assay we observed cooperation between CK2 catalytic subunits and oncogenic ras both in primary and immortalized fibroblasts, suggesting we are observing a general phenomenon. Moreover, our results are in agreement with experiments in transgenic mice where the constitutive expression of CK2α accelerated the formation of lymphomas induced by c-myc ortal-1 (18Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 19Kelliher M.A. Seldin D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5160-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Comparison of the growth curves of fibroblasts transformed with Ha-ras alone versusfibroblasts transformed with Ha-ras and CK2α′ demonstrated that transformed clones, expressing constitutivelyCK2α′, grew faster. The enhanced growth of Ha-ras and CK2α′-transformed clones correlates with increased catalytic activity when monitored using calmodulin as a phosphoacceptor substrate, symptomatic of the presence of free catalytic subunit (33Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4336-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 34Antonelli M. Daniotti J.L. Rojo D. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, these data suggest that unbalanced expression of CK2α′ or CK2α leads to phosphorylation of some critical target(s) necessary to accelerate the cell cycle progression of ras-transformed cells. Therefore, it seems likely that the transforming potential of CK2 in each experimental model is because of a fraction of catalytic subunits not combined with CK2β to form the canonical holoenzyme. This hypothesis is supported by the phosphorylation of calmodulin, because this protein is unaffected by the CK2 holoenzyme. In contrast the hypothesis that following serum treatment CK2α and CK2α′ not combined with CK2β could be transiently present in untransformed dividing cells is not consistent with available experimental data. Indeed, we observed that after serum treatment of fibroblast, CK2β was induced with the same kinetics of the catalytic subunits. In addition, by using the specific substrate calmodulin or by titrating in with recombinant CK2β, we did not detect free catalytic subunits in cell extracts (not shown). Therefore, it is likely that during the G0/G1 progression of the cell cycle the newly synthesized CK2α′ and CK2α are rapidly assembled into tetrameric CK2. Thus, the assembly of newly synthesized CK2 subunits into a tetrameric enzyme could represent a mechanism for the modulation of the too reactive free catalytic subunits necessary to reprogram the CK2 kinase activity during the progression of the cell cycle. Future studies aimed at the identification of specific target(s) of the CK2 catalytic subunits may unveil some target(s) critical for cell transformation.

Uracil, O6-methylguanine (O6-meG), and 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) were placed at specific sites downstream from the transcriptional start site on the transcribed strand of a duplex template under the control of the strong tac promoter. In vitro, single-round transcription experiments carried out with purified E. coli RNA polymerase revealed efficient bypass at the three lesions examined and subsequent generation of full-length runoff transcripts. Transcript sequence analysis revealed that E. coli RNA polymerase inserted primarily adenine into the transcript opposite to uracil, uracil opposite to O6-meG, and either adenine or cytosine opposite to 8-oxoG. Thus, a uracil in the DNA template resulted in a G-to-A transition mutation in the lesion bypass product whereas O6-meG produced a C-to-U transition mutation and 8-oxoG generated either the correct transcriptional product or a C-to-A transversion mutation. When 8-oxoG was placed within close proximity to the transcriptional start site (within the region required for effective promoter clearance), a reduced of full-length, runoff transcript was observed, indicative of lower promoter clearance. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the DNA base damages studied here may exert significant in vivo effects on gene expression and DNA repair with respect to the production of mutant proteins (transcriptional mutagenesis), or decreased levels of expressed proteins.

There are three major steps for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseO6-meGO6-methylguanine8-oxoG7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanineFpgformamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylasePCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)ntnucleotide(s)ITSinitial transcribed sequence.1The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseO6-meGO6-methylguanine8-oxoG7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanineFpgformamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylasePCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)ntnucleotide(s)ITSinitial transcribed sequence. to properly effect DNA template-dependent transcription: promoter binding and initiation, RNA chain elongation, and chain termination (1Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1995; 88: 1-21Google Scholar). Any of these steps could potentially be perturbed by DNA base damage occurring on the template strands of transcribed gene sequences, leading to various deleterious consequences for a cell. For example, certain bulky lesions such as UV light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and psoralen adducts if located on the transcribed strand of DNA have the ability to permanently arrest RNA polymerase at the site of damage during elongation (2Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 3Shi Y. Gamper H. Hearst J.E. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 8502-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). If left unrepaired, these lesions block gene expression. In E. coli, it is has been demonstrated that RNAP arrested at a DNA lesion is recognized by factors that may displace the arrested polymerase and recruit the appropriate repair machinery components to the damaged site in order to facilitate nucleotide excision repair (2Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 5Mellon I. Rajpal D.K. Koi M. Boland C.R. Champe G.N.

It has also been shown that damages such as UV light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, when located on the template strands of actively transcribed genes, are repaired preferentially compared with the nontemplate strand as well as nonexpressed regions of the genome (7Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 8Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C.

Thus, transcription-coupled repair is dependent on the ability of a specific DNA lesion to arrest an elongating RNAP. However, there exist several examples of DNA lesions such as abasic sites, uracil, dihydrouracil, and certain types of strand breaks that are efficiently bypassed by the E. coli transcription elongation complex, and thus presumably not subject to transcription-coupled repair (10Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Liu J.Z. Doetsch P.W. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1707-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these damages have been shown to be miscoding lesions for RNAP in vitro, causing base substitutions in the resulting transcripts.In addition to effects on RNAP elongation, it can be envisioned that certain base damages could also affect transcriptional initiation by altering the efficiency of the transition of the RNAP from the initiation state to an elongation complex (promoter clearance). Several reports have shown that ability of RNAP to clear the promoter may be dependent on the nucleotide sequence of the initially transcribed region of DNA (14Jacques J.-P. Susskind M.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11659-11667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Damaged bases within this initial region could affect promoter clearance and subsequently production of a full-length transcript. The effects of DNA lesions on this process are unknown.The goal of this work was to extend our previous studies concerning the effects of nonbulky DNA base lesions on elongation of various phage RNA polymerases by both expanding the range of lesions studied, and also by examining these effects on the more complex, multi-subunit E. coli RNAP. Uracil, 8-oxoG, and O6-meG are important DNA base damage products formed cytosine deamination, oxygen radical attack of guanine, and alkylating agent-induced methylation of guanine, respectively (17Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar). Each of the lesions studied are repaired by distinct base excision repair enzymes (uracil and 8-oxoG) or direct reversal proteins (O6-meG) with specificity for that base damage (17Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar). We examined whether these lesions allowed bypass of RNAP and, if so, whether these lesions were mutagenic at the level of transcription. In addition to further generalizing our previous elongation studies, we wished to study the effects of these damages on promoter clearance. From these experiments, we find that (i) uracil, 8-oxoG, and O6-meG are lesions that do not block E. coliRNAP during elongation, (ii) these lesions cause mutagenic base insertion RNAP during transcription, and (iii) when placed near the transcriptional start site, 8-oxoG decreases promoter clearance. These findings have broad implications for the effects of DNA damage on gene expression, transcription-coupled repair, and transcriptional mutagenesis.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study demonstrate that various types of DNA damage can have different effects on transcription by E. coli RNAP when such damages are located on the template strand of the transcribed DNA segment. First, we have shown that several nonbulky lesions affect the quality of the transcription products (i.e. mutation-containing) by allowing for efficient bypass and mutagenic base insertion during elongation. We have also demonstrated that when certain base damages such as 8-oxoG are located close to the transcriptional start site, there is a significant negative effect on promoter clearance by RNAP and a corresponding decrease in the level of transcript produced. It is conceivable that these lesions, which are efficiently bypassed by RNAP, may negatively influence their own repair if situated on the template strand of a transcribed segment of DNA. Therefore, if lesions that do not block RNAP accumulate and/or remain unrepaired, they could alter gene expression in several ways. As each of the lesions studied in this work are recognized by different repair enzymes, it is possible that a defect in any one of these enzymes could lead to the generation of significant levels of mutant protein or reduced gene expression.Uracil, 8-oxoG, and O6-meG are all efficiently bypassed byE. coli RNAP during elongation in vitro. Transcriptional bypass is accompanied by mutagenic base insertion events opposite to these lesions. Specifically, uracil inserts an adenine (assuming cytosine to be in the undamaged template), whereas 8-oxoguanine also frequently miscodes for adenine, and O6-methylguanine allows for the insertion of uracil. All of these events are equivalent to a base substitution mutation at the level of RNA synthesis (transcriptional mutagenesis). These findings have several important implications for DNA repair and mutagenesis in general. More bulky lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cause the permanent arrest of RNAP at the damage site, thus signaling the cellular proteins which direct various components of the DNA repair machinery to the damage site in order to carry out repair (2Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). It is the arrest of an elongating RNAP that is thought to be an important signal for initiating transcription-coupled repair of DNA damages located on the template strands of actively transcribed genes (7Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 8Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 9Bohr V.A. Hanawalt P.C. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the nonbulky base damages studied in this work as well as other lesions previously studied in our laboratory (10Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Liu J.Z. Doetsch P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6729-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) do not arrest an elongating RNAP, but rather allow for efficient bypass. This leads to the prediction that these lesions may not be subject to the transcription-coupled repair system involved in removing other DNA lesions that cause permanent RNAP arrest.With regard to transcriptional mutagenesis, it is evident that if these lesions remain unrepaired, a population of mutant RNA transcripts will be generated, subsequently leading to translation and production of mutant protein that could have toxic or other types of effects on cellular physiology. For example, transcriptional mutagenesis could lead to the production of a mutant protein that could cause the aberrant initiation of replication and cell division in a previously quiescent, non-dividing cell. As these lesions also cause mutagenic insertions for DNA polymerases, a mutagenic lesion for RNAP that leads to mutant protein through transcription could force a cell to divide, which subsequently, through the miscoding of DNA polymerase, could fix the mutation permanently into the cellular genome (10Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 23Bridges B.A. Nature. 1995; 375: 741Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).We have also shown that 8-oxoG, if located near the promoter of an actively transcribed DNA segment, causes decreased promoter clearance and hence lower amounts of expressed full-length transcript. Promoter clearance is a target of gene regulation, as several recent studies have shown (24Altmann C.R. Solow-Cordero D.E. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Qi F. Turnbough C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Qi F. Liu C. Heath L.S.

It has also been demonstrated recently that changes in the ITS in E. coli can markedly affect the ability of the polymerase to escape from the promoter (27Ellinger T. Behnke D. Bujard H. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our results provide further insight gained from these previous studies by showing that DNA damage can also have a “regulatory” effect on transcriptional initiation. There are several implications for decreased promoter clearance due to DNA damage. DNA damage could lower gene expression, which could potentially lead to toxic effects or a myriad of other effects due to inadequate amounts of an essential cellular protein. These results highlight the fact that ways in which specific DNA base damages are able to affect gene expression will depend on their exact location on the template strand of a transcribed gene. The extent to which transcriptional mutagenesis may affect gene expression in living cells is currently unknown and will be an important avenue of pursuit for future studies. There are three major steps for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseO6-meGO6-methylguanine8-oxoG7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanineFpgformamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylasePCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)ntnucleotide(s)ITSinitial transcribed sequence.1The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseO6-meGO6-methylguanine8-oxoG7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanineFpgformamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylasePCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)ntnucleotide(s)ITSinitial transcribed sequence. to properly effect DNA template-dependent transcription: promoter binding and initiation, RNA chain elongation, and chain termination (1Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1995; 88: 1-21Google Scholar). Any of these steps could potentially be perturbed by DNA base damage occurring on the template strands of transcribed gene sequences, leading to various deleterious consequences for a cell. For example, certain bulky lesions such as UV light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and psoralen adducts if located on the transcribed strand of DNA have the ability to permanently arrest RNA polymerase at the site of damage during elongation (2Selby C.P.

Thus, transcription-coupled repair is dependent on the ability of a specific DNA lesion to arrest an elongating RNAP. However, there exist several examples of DNA lesions such as abasic sites, uracil, dihydrouracil, and certain types of strand breaks that are efficiently bypassed by the E. coli transcription elongation complex, and thus presumably not subject to transcription-coupled repair (10Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Liu J.Z. Doetsch P.W. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1707-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these damages have been shown to be miscoding lesions for RNAP in vitro, causing base substitutions in the resulting transcripts.

RNA polymerase O6-methylguanine 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) nucleotide(s) initial transcribed sequence. In addition to effects on RNAP elongation, it can be envisioned that certain base damages could also affect transcriptional initiation by altering the efficiency of the transition of the RNAP from the initiation state to an elongation complex (promoter clearance). Several reports have shown that ability of RNAP to clear the promoter may be dependent on the nucleotide sequence of the initially transcribed region of DNA (14Jacques J.-P. Susskind M.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11659-11667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Damaged bases within this initial region could affect promoter clearance and subsequently production of a full-length transcript. The effects of DNA lesions on this process are unknown. The goal of this work was to extend our previous studies concerning the effects of nonbulky DNA base lesions on elongation of various phage RNA polymerases by both expanding the range of lesions studied, and also by examining these effects on the more complex, multi-subunit E. coli RNAP. Uracil, 8-oxoG, and O6-meG are important DNA base damage products formed cytosine deamination, oxygen radical attack of guanine, and alkylating agent-induced methylation of guanine, respectively (17Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar). Each of the lesions studied are repaired by distinct base excision repair enzymes (uracil and 8-oxoG) or direct reversal proteins (O6-meG) with specificity for that base damage (17Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar). We examined whether these lesions allowed bypass of RNAP and, if so, whether these lesions were mutagenic at the level of transcription. In addition to further generalizing our previous elongation studies, we wished to study the effects of these damages on promoter clearance. From these experiments, we find that (i) uracil, 8-oxoG, and O6-meG are lesions that do not block E. coliRNAP during elongation, (ii) these lesions cause mutagenic base insertion RNAP during transcription, and (iii) when placed near the transcriptional start site, 8-oxoG decreases promoter clearance. These findings have broad implications for the effects of DNA damage on gene expression, transcription-coupled repair, and transcriptional mutagenesis. DISCUSSIONThe results of this study demonstrate that various types of DNA damage can have different effects on transcription by E. coli RNAP when such damages are located on the template strand of the transcribed DNA segment. First, we have shown that several nonbulky lesions affect the quality of the transcription products (i.e. mutation-containing) by allowing for efficient bypass and mutagenic base insertion during elongation. We have also demonstrated that when certain base damages such as 8-oxoG are located close to the transcriptional start site, there is a significant negative effect on promoter clearance by RNAP and a corresponding decrease in the level of transcript produced. It is conceivable that these lesions, which are efficiently bypassed by RNAP, may negatively influence their own repair if situated on the template strand of a transcribed segment of DNA. Therefore, if lesions that do not block RNAP accumulate and/or remain unrepaired, they could alter gene expression in several ways. As each of the lesions studied in this work are recognized by different repair enzymes, it is possible that a defect in any one of these enzymes could lead to the generation of significant levels of mutant protein or reduced gene expression.Uracil, 8-oxoG, and O6-meG are all efficiently bypassed byE. coli RNAP during elongation in vitro. Transcriptional bypass is accompanied by mutagenic base insertion events opposite to these lesions. Specifically, uracil inserts an adenine (assuming cytosine to be in the undamaged template), whereas 8-oxoguanine also frequently miscodes for adenine, and O6-methylguanine allows for the insertion of uracil. All of these events are equivalent to a base substitution mutation at the level of RNA synthesis (transcriptional mutagenesis). These findings have several important implications for DNA repair and mutagenesis in general. More bulky lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cause the permanent arrest of RNAP at the damage site, thus signaling the cellular proteins which direct various components of the DNA repair machinery to the damage site in order to carry out repair (2Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). It is the arrest of an elongating RNAP that is thought to be an important signal for initiating transcription-coupled repair of DNA damages located on the template strands of actively transcribed genes (7Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 8Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C.

However, the nonbulky base damages studied in this work as well as other lesions previously studied in our laboratory (10Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Liu J.Z. Doetsch P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6729-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) do not arrest an elongating RNAP, but rather allow for efficient bypass. This leads to the prediction that these lesions may not be subject to the transcription-coupled repair system involved in removing other DNA lesions that cause permanent RNAP arrest.With regard to transcriptional mutagenesis, it is evident that if these lesions remain unrepaired, a population of mutant RNA transcripts will be generated, subsequently leading to translation and production of mutant protein that could have toxic or other types of effects on cellular physiology. For example, transcriptional mutagenesis could lead to the production of a mutant protein that could cause the aberrant initiation of replication and cell division in a previously quiescent, non-dividing cell. As these lesions also cause mutagenic insertions for DNA polymerases, a mutagenic lesion for RNAP that leads to mutant protein through transcription could force a cell to divide, which subsequently, through the miscoding of DNA polymerase, could fix the mutation permanently into the cellular genome (10Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Promoter clearance is a target of gene regulation, as several recent studies have shown (24Altmann C.R. Solow-Cordero D.E. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has also been demonstrated recently that changes in the ITS in E. coli can markedly affect the ability of the polymerase to escape from the promoter (27Ellinger T. Behnke D. Bujard H. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our results provide further insight gained from these previous studies by showing that DNA damage can also have a “regulatory” effect on transcriptional initiation. There are several implications for decreased promoter clearance due to DNA damage. DNA damage could lower gene expression, which could potentially lead to toxic effects or a myriad of other effects due to inadequate amounts of an essential cellular protein. These results highlight the fact that ways in which specific DNA base damages are able to affect gene expression will depend on their exact location on the template strand of a transcribed gene. The extent to which transcriptional mutagenesis may affect gene expression in living cells is currently unknown and will be an important avenue of pursuit for future studies.

Its C-terminal portion displays significant similarity with calmodulin and contains two EF-hand motifs. The corresponding mRNA is highly expressed in rat brain, primarily in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum; its expression appears to be restricted to neurons. Transcript levels increase during postnatal development. A recombinant C-terminal protein fragment binds Ca2+ as indicated by a Ca2+-induced mobility shift in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Antisera generated against the bacterial fusion protein recognize a brain-specific protein doublet with apparent molecular masses of 33 and 36 kDa. These data are confirmed by in vitro translation, which generates a single 36-kDa polypeptide, and by the heterologous expression in 293 cells, which yields a 33/36-kDa doublet comparable to that found in brain. On two-dimensional gels, the 33-kDa band separates into a chain of spots plausibly due to differential phosphorylation. This view is supported by in situ phosphorylation studies in hippocampal slices. Most of the immunoreactivity is detectable in cytoskeletal preparations with a further enrichment in the synapse-associated cytomatrix. These biochemical data, together with the ultra-structural localization in dendrites and the postsynaptic density, strongly suggest an association with the somato-dendritic cytoskeleton.

Therefore, this novel Ca2+-binding protein was named caldendrin. Neurons are structurally and functionally highly polarized cells consisting of an axonal sending and a somato-dendritc receptive compartment. Communication between neurons occurs at synapses, which are asymmetric cell-cell contact sites that typically consist of specialized membrane structures and the underlying cytoskeleton. These cellular specializations derive from the axon of the presynaptic neuron and a dendrite of the postsynaptic neuron. Normal synaptic transmission as well as synaptic plasticity, i.e.use-dependent modulation of synaptic strength, critically depend on intracellular signaling processes on either side of the synapse. Although many of these signaling pathways are mediated by few common messengers, including Ca2+ or cAMP, local specificity is achieved by clustering protein components involved in these pathways at distinct subcellular sites. One such site is the postsynaptic density (PSD), 1The abbreviations used are: PSDpostsynaptic densityCaBPcalcium-binding proteinDABdiaminobenzidineHEKhuman embryonic kidneyNCSneuronal calcium sensorORFopen reading framePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisChaps3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid an electron-dense proteinaceous structure of the postsynaptic cytoskeleton at excitatory synapses, which is thought to cluster together neurotransmitter receptors with components of signaling pathways (1Burns M.E.

Moreover, calmodulin in its Ca2+-bound state is able to bind and activate calmodulin kinase II, a multifunctional kinase highly enriched in the PSD, which is engaged in several processes of neuronal plasticity including the induction of long term potentiation (15Fukunaga K.

Calcineurin has been shown to dephosphorylate the NMDA receptor in a Ca2+-dependent manner, thereby shortening the channel openings (17Lieberman D.N. Mody I.

For isolation of the synaptic junction proteins (PSD fraction), the synaptosomal fraction of the first gradient was diluted with 320 mm sucrose (60 ml/10 g of wet tissue) and an equal volume of 1% Triton X-100, 320 mm sucrose, and 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. The suspension was kept on ice for 15 min and centrifuged for 30 min at 32,800 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 320 mm sucrose, 1 mmNaHCO3 (2.5 ml/10 g pf wet tissue) and fractionated in a second sucrose step gradient as described (25Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Synaptic junction proteins (PSD fraction) were diluted with 320 mm sucrose, 1 mm NaHCO3 and an equal volume of 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm KCl solution, and pelleted for 20 min at 201,800 × g. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Extraction experiments of P2 pellets with various agents were performed as follows. P2 pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer, aliquoted into six samples (200 mg of protein each) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. Each pellet was then resuspended in 0.5 ml of one of the extraction buffers, incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking, and centrifuged again for 15 min at 100,000 × g. The resulting pellets were washed in homogenization buffer and dissolved in 80 μl of gel loading buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). The supernatants were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the resulting pellets were dissolved in 80 μl of loading buffer. Separation of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 5–20% gels under fully reducing conditions and transfer onto nitrocellulose were performed as described previously (21Kistner U. Wenzel B.M. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Garner A.M. Appeltauer U. Voss B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4580-4583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar was applied using the Hoefer SE 250 two-dimensional system. Western blots were immunodeveloped by overnight incubation with primary antiserum (29Seidenbecher C.I. Richter K. Rauch U. Fassler R. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27206-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and immunoreactivity visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig, Germany). A caldendrin cDNA fragment that comprises nucleotides 1–1025 containing the entire open reading frame (ORF, see Fig. 1) was subcloned into the pRC/CMV vector (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were transiently transfected using the DAC-30 transfection reagent (Eurogentech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunocytochemical staining was carried out using 7-μm microtome sections from rat brains, which were fixed by immersion in Bouin's fluid for 48 h, dehydrated, and embedded in paraplast. Caldendrin was detected with a purified Ig fraction of the rabbit anti caldendrin polyclonal antibody diluted 1:3,000 using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Antibody binding was visualized by incubating sections first with porcine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany) and subsequently with rabbit peroxidase-antiperoxidase complex (DAKO). Subsequently, the detection reagent, 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma, Munich, Germany), was applied. Some sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for morphological orientation. Controls were performed as follows: (i) preabsorption of the antibody with the antigen and (ii) omitting the first or secondary antibody. Electron microscopy was carried out using vibratome sections (50 μm) from rat brains fixed by perfusion with 3% acrolein, 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.35. Floating sections were stained with the Vectastain ABC staining kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After color reaction with diaminobenzidine, the sections were extensively washed in 0.05 m Tris/HCl buffer (pH,7.4) (twice) and 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) (twice) before being fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h (4 °C). Subsequently sections were further washed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) (twice) and doubly distilled water (ddH2O) (four times). Silver enhancement of the DAB product was performed as follows: Solution A consisted of 3% hexamethylenetetramine in ddH2O; solution B consisted of 5% silver nitrate (AgNO3) in ddH2O; solution C consisted 2.5% disodium tetraborate in ddH2O; solution D consisted of 0.05% tetrachloroauric(III) acid in ddH2O; solution E consisted of 2.5% sodium thiosulfate in ddH2O. First, sections were incubated for 10 min at 60 °C in a premade mixed solution (5 ml (A) + 250 μl (B) + 500 μl (C)) and afterward washed in distilled water (dH2O) (3 × 3 min). After these washing steps, sections were incubated in solution D at room temperature for 3 min, washed with dH2O (3 × 3 min), incubated in solution E for 3 min, and washed again for 3 × 3 min in dH2O. Subsequently, the sections were postfixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in epon. Parallel semithin sections were stained with toluidine blue for morphological orientation; ultrathin sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate/lead citrate prior to analysis with a Philips electron microscope. For in situ phosphorylation studies, hippocampal slices were prepared and incubated in 100 μCi of33P (final concentration in the incubation medium 50 μCi/ml) as described previously (30Staak S. Behnisch T. Angenstein F. Brain Res. 1995; 682: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After 90 min of labeling time, slices were rinsed with homogenization buffer A (10 mmTris/HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), homogenized, and spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of polyclonal rabbit antiserum preabsorbed to GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The remaining pellet was extracted with 1% SDS. For immunoprecipitation of caldendrin, the resulting supernatant was diluted with 10 mm Tris/HCl to give a final SDS concentration of 0.2%. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (23Langnaese K. Beesley P.W. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 821-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Non-binding proteins and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose (0.45 μm pore size). Western blots were dried, and 33P incorporation was visualized using a Fujix BAS1000 Bioimager. Detection of the immunoprecipitate on Western blots was performed with a polyclonal mouse caldendrin antiserum. From a collection of cDNA clones isolated by expression screening with antisera against a rat brain synaptic protein preparation (22Langnaese K. Seidenbecher C. Wex H. Seidel B. Hartung K. Appeltauer U. Garner A. Voss B. Mueller B. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), one cDNA clone, termed sap8i, encoded a protein fragment that displayed distinct sequence similarity to rat calmodulin. The clone was used to isolate a set of seven overlapping cDNAs ranging in size from 1 to 1.4 kilobases. They harbor an open reading frame of 298 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). The translation initiation site was assigned to nucleotides 86–88 encoding the first in-frame methionine. This region fits well with the consensus pattern for eukaryotic translation initiation ((A/G)CC AUG (G/A); Ref. 31Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar), including a 5′ GC-rich region with only one mismatch at the −1 position (G instead of C). In vitro translation and heterologous expression studies confirmed the use of this initiation site (see below). A putative polyadenylation signal is formed by nucleotides 1385–1390 (bold in Fig. 1A). The deduced protein caldendrin has a calculated Mrof 33,071 and a theoretical isoelectric point of 7.42. Whereas primary structure analysis revealed no identifiable structural features in the N-terminal half of the protein, the C-terminal part displays a high degree of similarity to the entire reading frame of rat calmodulin. As shown in an alignment of both proteins (Fig. 1 B), two of the four Ca2+-binding EF-hand structures found in calmodulin are conserved in the novel protein. However, the remaining two miss several essential residues in the consensus pattern. Within the aligned region sequence, identity and similarity between caldendrin and calmodulin are 42% and 57%, respectively. The N-terminal half of caldendrin contains seven putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (arrows in Fig. 1 A) and an unusually high proline content (13%). Several human expressed sequence tags (GenBank accession nos. N48250,H93147, AA363865, AA364517, H92751, AA349351, and AA364942) have a high degree of nucleotide identity (81–89%) with corresponding stretches in the caldendrin cDNA, strongly suggesting that they encode human caldendrin. Northern blot analysis revealed a single hybridizing band of 1.8 kilobases that is detectable in various brain regions with strongest expression in the cerebral cortex. No hybridization is detected in heart, muscle, liver, and C6 glioma cells (Fig.2 A). During brain development, hybridization signals were first observed in the second postnatal week,i.e. during period of synapse formation and terminal differentiation of the brain. After the initial period of increase caldendrin, mRNA levels remain essentially unchanged throughout later ontogenetic stages (Fig. 2 B). To examine the transcript distribution at the cellular level, we performed in situ hybridization studies in horizontal brain sections (Fig. 2, C and D). With this more sensitive method the transcript can be clearly localized first at day P10 to distinct brain regions including cerebral cortex, developing cerebellar cortex, and hippocampal formation (Fig. 2 C). In adult rats, the hybridization pattern is qualitatively the same, while the labeling intensity has increased (Fig. 2 D). Silver grains were mainly found in cortically organized parts of the brain. Interestingly, the hippocampal subfields are not uniformly labeled. In contrast to a very prominent hybridization in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer, labeling of the CA1 region and the dentate gyrus is much less intense (Fig. 2 E). Thus, caldendrin expression is restricted to certain brain regions and the transcript seems to be differentially expressed, at least in the hippocampus, in different subsets of cells. In control experiments, the use of a sense oligonucleotide, competition with 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide as well as washing steps above the calculated melting temperature of the hybrid yielded no significant labeling. Specificity of the hybridization was further confirmed by use of two independent oligonucleotide probes that produced virtually identical results (data not shown). A caldendrin cDNA fragment comprising nucleotides 500–979 (see Fig. 1) was generated via polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the pQE30 vector to generate a bacterially expressed fusion protein including amino acids 139–298 and six histidine residues at the N terminus. This fusion protein has a calculatedMr of 19.386 kDa. In the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, a clear mobility shift in the PAGE gel can be observed, indicating the ability of the caldendrin C terminus to bind Ca2+ (Fig. 3). This shift is most plausibly based on conformational changes that occur in caldendrin upon Ca2+ binding as has been shown for other CaBP, e.g. calmodulin (32Garrigos M. Deschamps S. Viel A. Lund S. Champeil P. Moller J.V. le Maire M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Geiser J.R. van Tuinen D. Brockerhoff S.E. Neff M.M. Davis T.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 949-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) or VILIP (34Lenz S.E. Braunewell K.H. Weise C. Nedlina-Chittka A. Gundelfinger E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was used to raise polyclonal caldendrin antisera in mice and rabbits. Three independent antisera specifically detect a protein doublet of 33/36 kDa in brain protein preparations (Fig. 4). This doublet is not recognized by either of the pre-immune sera (data not shown). To get a first clue to the biochemical nature of the two polypeptides, we tested their solubility in low salt buffer and detergent. The 33-kDa protein isoform is partly found in soluble protein fractions (SP in Fig. 4). The Triton X-100 extract of the remaining pellet does not contain significant amounts of either of the immunoreactive bands. The 36-kDa caldendrin polypeptide is almost exclusively found in the aqueous and detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal pellet (CP in Fig. 4). During postnatal brain development, the amounts of caldendrin immunoreactivity increase from the second to the eighth postnatal week both in soluble and cytoskeletal protein fractions. Heart and kidney protein preparations obtained from 8-week-old rats are devoid of caldendrin immunoreactivity (H and K in Fig. 4). To verify the proposed ORF, a coupled cell-free transcription/translation system was used to generate the primary caldendrin translation product in vitro. Translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. A single immunoreactive product with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa was observed that co-migrates with the upper caldendrin band detected on brain protein blots (Fig. 5 A). Control reactions without added caldendrin cDNA do not synthesize this polypeptide (lane 1 in Fig. 5 A). In order to elucidate the nature of the protein doublet found in brain protein compared with the single in vitro translation product, the caldendrin cDNA was transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). Whereas untransfected HEK cells do not express any caldendrin immunoreactivity (Fig. 5 B, lane 1), transfected cells produce two caldendrin isoforms of 36 and 33 kDa comparable to that detected in brain (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, in both cases, only the 33-kDa isoform appears in the soluble fraction. These findings clearly indicate that both isoforms originate from a single transcript and that the difference in migration behavior should result from posttranslational modification, which occurs both in brain and in the heterologous 293 cell expression system, but not in the in vitro reticulocyte system. Subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation of brain proteins demonstrated that caldendrin immunoreactivity is associated with nearly all particulate fractions including light and heavy membrane fractions and several synaptic fractions, like synaptosomes, synaptic membranes and the PSD fraction (Fig.6 A). The immunoreactivity in particular of the 36-kDa band is clearly enriched in the PSD fraction after the second washing step with Triton X-100 (T2 in Fig.6 A), indicating a tight association with the synaptic cytomatrix. However, caldendrin appears not to be an exclusively synaptic protein. To investigate the association of caldendrin with the cytoskeleton, several attempts were made to solubilize the 36-kDa isoform from the crude membrane fraction (14,000 × g pellet P2) as shown in Fig. 6 B. A complete extraction was successful with a combination of high salt and detergent (1 m NaCl, 2.5% Chaps), with chaotropic agents (3 m KSCN) and under fully denaturing conditions (8 m urea). Treatment with 1m Tris, even in combination with 1% Triton X-100 as well as alkaline conditions (pH 11.5), did not lead to a release of substantial amounts of 36-kDa caldendrin. Interestingly, alkaline treatment results in a complete extraction of 33-kDa caldendrin, thereby fully separating both isoforms. These solubilization characteristics of the protein indicate an association, particularly of the larger caldendrin isoform, with the neuronal cytomatrix. This assumption is supported by light and electron microscopic localization of caldendrin immunoreactivity in the brain. A representative light micrograph (Fig.7 A) shows several immunopositive neurons of the cerebral cortex. Within the neurons, caldendrin is found only in the somato-dendritic compartment. No immunostaining is found associated with axonal processes of neurons or in glial cells. Staining is most intense underneath the membranes of the neuronal cell bodies as well as within the dendrites as depicted at higher magnification in Fig. 7 B. In the CA3 region of the hippocampal formation, the pyramidal neurons as well as some hilus neurons are intensely stained (Fig. 7 C). The picture also reveals immunoreactivity in pyramidal cell primary dendrites. Ultrastructural localization studies in the hippocampal CA3 region confirm the dendritic and postsynaptic localization (Fig. 7,D and E). Interestingly, accumulation of the reaction product is not evenly distributed inside the dendrites but concentrates along intracellular membranes and cytoskeletal structures like tubular bundles as depicted in Fig. 7 D. This is in good agreement with the biochemical data. We never observed any immunolabeling of glial cells, axons or axon terminals at the ultrastructural level (AT in Fig. 7 E). Consistent with the subcellular fractionation studies caldendrin appears highly enriched at PSDs (Fig. 7 E). The primary structure of caldendrin contains seven putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (see Fig. 1). Therefore, w"

Both HepG2 cells, normally secreting full-length apoB (apoB-100), and C127 cells transfected to secrete truncated forms of apoB, apoB-41, apoB-29, and apoB-17, respectively, were employed. C127 cells were used to determine whether chaperone binding is dependent on apoB lipidation as they secrete both unlipidated and lipidated apoB forms despite their lack of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which mediates lipidation of apoB in HepG2 cells. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident molecular chaperones GRP94, calreticulin, and ERp72 were co-immunoprecipitated with apoB-100 from HepG2 cell lysates following cross-linking of proteins in living cells. The same chaperones including BiP/GRP78 were also associated with all truncated forms of apoB. Sequential immunoprecipitation with antibodies to MTP and apoB revealed the presence of ternary complexes containing apoB-100, MTP, and ERp72. However, MTP is not obligatory for the binding of ERp72 as it was associated with all truncated forms of apoB in C127 cells that lack MTP. The interactions between apoB-100 and ERp72 or GRP94 persisted for at least 2 h following a 30-min pulse. Thus, BiP/GRP78, calreticulin, ERp72, and GRP94 may participate in critical steps in the folding of apoB before any substantial lipidation occurs. ERp72 and GRP94 may also mediate the folding of more advanced folding intermediates and/or target the misfolded underlipidated pool of apoB for degradation.

Its folding into a mature, secretion-competent form necessitates assembly with triacylglycerols (TAG) and phospholipids to produce TAG-rich lipoproteins such as very low density lipoproteins and chylomicrons (1Kane J.P.

It was proposed that distinct amphipathic elements in the secondary structure of apoB may initiate the binding of lipids to apoB co-translationally (5Small D.M. Atkinson D. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3PubMed Google Scholar). Further, growing evidence suggests that the process of apoB maturation in the cell is mediated by molecular chaperones (3Ginsberg H.N. Clin. Exp.

Indeed, the recruitment of lipids to the nascent lipoprotein is significantly aided by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) localized to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (reviewed in Ref. 8Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). MTP is a heterodimer composed of a 97-kDa subunit (MTPL) and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). The latter belongs to the family of the abundant thioredoxin-like proteins in the ER lumen, which catalyze the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds. PDI also functions as a molecular chaperone, and this function is independent of its enzymatic activity (reviewed in Ref. 9Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. EXS. 1996; 77: 97-117PubMed Google Scholar).

In this report, we investigate whether other highly abundant ER-resident proteins known to function as molecular chaperones participate in the folding of apoB, and whether the chaperone-apoB interactions are dependent on the state of apoB lipidation. To identify chaperones that interact with apoB, we used human hepatic-derived HepG2 cells normally secreting the full-length apoB-100, as well as stably transfected C127 cells derived from murine mammary gland secreting truncated forms of apoB corresponding to the N-terminal 41, 29, and 17% of apoB-100, designated apoB-41, apoB-29, and apoB-17, respectively. The transfected C127 cells were chosen as a model to study the dependence of the interactions on the lipidation state of apoB for two reasons: 1) these cells are devoid of endogenous apoB and MTP, and 2) apoB-41 is secreted by these cells exclusively on high density lipoprotein-like particles (22Herscovitz H.

Here, we report that three other ER-resident molecular chaperones interact with apoB: calreticulin, ERp72, and GRP94. Calreticulin, a major calcium-binding protein, has been well documented to function as a molecular chaperone which can substitute for calnexin (reviewed in Ref. 24Krause K.-H. Michalak M. Cell. 1997; 88: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, the roles of ERp72, a member of the thioredoxin family (25Mazzarella R. Srinivasan M. Haugejorden S.H. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1094-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GRP94, a stress protein homologous to the cytosolic Hsp90 (26Mazzarella R.A. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in protein folding are poorly understood. Both proteins exhibit specific binding to various denatured proteins in vitro (27Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rhode M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They have also been found to associate intracellularly with nascent polypeptides such as thyroglobulin (28Kuznetzov G. Chen L.

Our results indicate that GRP94 and ERp72 interact with both early and more advanced folding intermediates of apoB and presumably mediate its folding into a secretion-competent from. All tested chaperones were found to interact with apoB whether it is lipidated or not. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

HepG2 cells and murine mammary-derived C127 cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding truncated forms of apoB were grown to 70–90% confluence as described (22Herscovitz H. Kritis A. Talianidis I.

Prior to the metabolic labeling cells were washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (DPBS), and pre-incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (labeling medium) for 1 h. Cells were then washed in DPBS and pulse-labeled with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine in labeling medium for 30 min, washed in chase medium (DMEM containing 10 μmcycloheximide and 2 mm each methionine and cysteine) and incubated in the same medium for 2 h (chase). At the conclusion of pulse or chase, cells were harvested by scraping, washed in ice-cold DPBS and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 2% CHAPS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mmAEBSF, and 10 μg/ml ALLN). After a 30-min pulse labeling as described above, cells were harvested by scraping, combined and washed in cold DPBS. Cells were lysed on ice by addition of lysis buffer which in some cases was supplemented with either 5 mm EDTA and 5 mmEGTA, or 50 units/ml apyrase, or 2.5 mm ATP and 2.5 mm MgCl2. When cross-linking was performed, two different protocols were used. 1) For cross-linking during lysis, cells were incubated for 30 min on ice in lysis buffer containing 1 mm AEBSF and 0.2 mm DSP freshly prepared from a 2,000-fold frozen stock in dimethyl sulfoxide (34Degen E. Williams D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1099-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Unreacted cross-linking reagent was blocked for 10 min by adjusting the lysates to 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Lysates were then supplemented with protease inhibitors as stated above. 2) For in situcross-linking of proteins in living cells, cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with 0.2 mm DSP in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS), adjusted to 50 mm Tris/HCl, and incubated for 10 min. Cells were then scraped, washed, and solubilized in lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors as described above. Prior to immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were pre-cleared by incubating with protein G-Sepharose for 45 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight with various antibodies or corresponding non-immune sera in control samples. Samples were then adjusted to 2% Carnation nonfat dry milk (to reduce nonspecific binding to protein G-Sepharose) (34Degen E. Williams D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1099-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C to capture immunocomplexes. The beads were washed sequentially in the following buffers: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% CHAPS; same buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl, and finally, PBS. When sequential immunoprecipitation was carried out, washed beads were heated to a 100 °C for 5 min in 1% SDS in PBS, diluted 5-fold with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, incubated with a second antibody overnight, and recaptured on protein G-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl in PBS, and then heated at 100 °C for 5 min in sample buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and 8 m urea and analyzed by 4–7% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis modified from Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) followed by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For Western blot analysis, proteins were electrotransferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane, probed with respective antibodies, and visualized by the ECL technique (according to the manufacturer's instructions). Molecular chaperones bind to nascent polypeptides and mediate their folding into their mature native forms. Because these interactions are transient in nature, it is necessary to solubilize cells under conditions that preserve chaperone-substrate complexes. Indeed, some chaperones (e.g. BiP, calnexin, and Hsp70) have been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with their substrates following non-denaturing solubilization of cells in buffers containing such detergents as CHAPS, sodium cholate, Triton X-100, or Nonidet P-40 (11Ou W-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar,28Kuznetzov G. Chen L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

However, some weak interactions between chaperones and their substrates were still disrupted by these detergents (28Kuznetzov G. Chen L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Degen E. Williams D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1099-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional manipulations were required to prevent the release of chaperones from their substrates. One such manipulation is based on the property of some chaperones to release their substrates upon binding of ATP (6Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar, 7Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 38Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) in the presence of divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, etc.). Thus, reducing the level of ATP and/or divalent cations during lysis of cells may prevent the release of these chaperones and thereby enhance their detection (28Kuznetzov G. Chen L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L.-S Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, for chaperones that are ATP-independent, or when chaperone-substrate interactions are still disrupted, cross-linking of proteins could be required to preserve the integrity of chaperone-substrate complexes (28Kuznetzov G. Chen L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Degen E. Williams D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1099-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 39Melnick J. Dul J. Argon Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Since little is known about chaperone-assisted folding of apoB, it was important to establish optimal lysis conditions that would allow us to detect as many apoB-associated chaperones as possible. To that end, HepG2 cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min and then subjected to various lysis conditions followed by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies to apoB (Fig. 1). The following buffers were used: lysis buffer (2% CHAPS in HEPES-buffered saline) (lanes 1 and 7), lysis buffer containing: (a) EDTA and EGTA to chelate divalent cations (lanes 2 and8), (b) an ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme, apyrase (lanes 3 and 9), or (c) ATP and MgCl2 (lanes 4 and 10). The membrane-permeable homobifunctional cleavable cross-linking reagent DSP was utilized in two methodologically distinct approaches: 1) during the first 30 min of lysis (lanes 5 and 11); and 2) prior to lysis, i.e. in situ cross-linking in living cells, to probe for in vivo associations of chaperones with apoB before lysis of cells that could potentially disrupt apoB-chaperone complexes (lanes 6 and12). Fig. 1 shows that the ER-resident chaperones: GRP94, the human homologue of murine ERp72 and calreticulin, and the cytosolic chaperone Hsc70, were co-immunoprecipitated with apoB (lanes 1–6). The control samples that were incubated in non-immune serum showed either no bands or bands with lower intensities of the corresponding chaperones (lanes 7–12). The levels of chaperones that co-immunoprecipitated with apoB varied substantially under different lysis conditions (Fig. 1), despite a relatively small variability (about 30%) in the efficiency of immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled apoB. The highest levels of GRP94 and ERp72 co-immunoprecipitated with apoB-100 were detected upon in situ cross-linking of proteins (lane 6). The lysis buffer seemed to promote the dissociation of a significant fraction of these apoB-bound chaperones even before the cross-linking reaction could take place (compare lane 5 to lane 6). Because these chaperones were cross-linked to apoB in living cells, we conclude that they interact with apoB in vivo. Kuznetzovet al. (28Kuznetzov G. Chen L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kuznetzov G. Chen L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3057-3063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) also observed that the interactions between GRP94 or ERp72 and thyroglobulin and thrombospondin in thyrocytes were disrupted by lysis buffer, and cross-linking of proteins in situ enhanced their detection. Similarly, detection of GRP94 associated with immunoglobulin L chain in myeloma cells also required cross-linking of cellular proteins (39Melnick J. Dul J. Argon Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). GRP94 was found to require ATP for its release from apoB-100, as higher amounts of GRP94 were co-immunoprecipitated with apoB upon a reduction of the ATP levels by the ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase (Fig. 1,lane 3). Lower levels of GRP94 were co-immunoprecipitated with apoB from the unsupplemented lysates or from the lysates supplemented with ATP (lanes 1 and 4, respectively). Thus, the unsupplemented lysates had sufficient levels of ATP should release of GRP94 occur. In contrast to our study, Melnicket al. (39Melnick J. Dul J. Argon Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) reported that a reduction of the intracellular levels of ATP in myeloma cells led to the release of GRP94 from immunoglobulin L chains. Despite this discrepancy, both our study and that of Melnick et al. suggest that GRP94 may be an ATP-binding protein. However, the binding of ATP to GRP94 also purported in other studies (40Li Z. Srivastava P.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 41Clairmont C.A. De Maio A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5152-5156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), who suggested that the binding and hydrolysis of ATP is not an inherent property of GRP94. However, ATP-binding sites were predicted by sequence analysis of GRP94 (40Li Z. Srivastava P.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 42Csermely P. Miyata Y. Schnaider T. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6381-6388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and inferred from the crystal structure of its cytosolic homologue Hsp90 (44Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). In light of this controversy, it remains undetermined whether the release of GRP94 from apoB occurs upon binding of ATP to GRP94 itself or to other proteins that may be present in the complexes. This idea is consistent with the proposal that chaperones in the ER form large heterocomplexes with their substrate polypeptides (45Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Further, modulation of the “chaperone machinery” by accessory proteins has been documented for cytosolic chaperones (46Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 47Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, the opposite effects observed following reduction of ATP levels on the interaction between GRP94 and apoB-100 or immunoglobulin L chains may be attributed to differences in the composition of chaperones present in GRP94-apoB-100- and GRP94-immunoglobulin L chain-containing complexes. Unlike GRP94 and ERp72, the ER-lumenal chaperone calreticulin and the cytosolic chaperone Hsc70 (the constitutively expressed form of Hsp70) could not be detected after cross-linking (Fig. 1, lanes 5and 6); however, they were observed under other conditions. Calreticulin was found to be elevated in the presence of the chelating agents EDTA and EGTA (lane 2), suggesting that the release of calreticulin from apoB was restricted when divalent cations in the lysates were sequestered. In contrast, the membrane-bound homologue of calreticulin, calnexin, appeared to require divalent cations (presumably Ca2+) for its association with a secretion-incompetent variant of α1-antitrypsin (49Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Zn2+, on the other hand, was shown to cause dissociation of calreticulin-PDI complexes in vitro (50Bercovitch B. Stancovski I. Mayer A. Blumenfeld N. Laszlo A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Further proof for the interaction between calreticulin and apoB-100 in HepG2 cells was obtained in a separate experiment where nascent apoB was co-precipitated by antibodies to calreticulin following in situcross-linking (data not shown). This implies that calreticulin interacts with apoB in vivo, and that the amount of calreticulin cross-linked to apoB on the presented blot was below a detectable level (lane 6). The cytosolic Hsc70 was detected only when the concentration of ATP in the lysate was reduced by apyrase (lane 3). The ATP-dependent release of Hsp70 from its substrates has been demonstrated in other systems (38Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The association of Hsc70 with apoB was further corroborated in a separate experiment, in which a 4-fold greater number of cells were pooled, subjected to in situcross-linking, lysed, and then immunoprecipitated with antibodies to apoB. Hsc70 was detected by immunoblotting. 3J. Zhang and H. Herscovitz, unpublished observations. Fisheret al. (21Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J.

In this report, we describe a novel, supercoiling-dependent, DNA structural transmission mechanism for this activation. We provide theoretical evidence for a supercoiling-induced DNA duplex destabilized (SIDD) structure in the A + T-rich, ilvPG regulatory region between base pair positions +1 and −160. We show that the region of this SIDD sequence immediately upstream of an IHF binding site centered at base pair position −92 is, in fact, destabilized by superhelical stress and that this duplex destabilization is inhibited by IHF binding. Thus, in the presence of IHF, the negative superhelical twist normally absorbed by this DNA structure in the promoter distal half of the SIDD sequence is transferred to the downstream portion of the SIDD sequence containing the ilvPG promoter site. This IHF-mediated translocation of superhelical energy facilitates duplex destabilization in the −10 region of the downstream ilvPG promoter and activates transcription by increasing the rate of open complex formation.

Negative superhelicity imposed on a DNA domain can drive local transitions to several types of alternate DNA conformations. These include cruciform extrusion at inverted repeat sequences, Z-DNA at alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences, and denaturation (also called local melting) that concentrates at A + T-rich sites (1Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Aboul-ela F. Bowater R.P. Lilley D.M. J. Biol.

A. 1988; 85: 9464-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Each of these transitions requires free energy, and each releases free energy because the change of local helicity that occurs upon formation partially relaxes the imposed superhelicity. In a domain containing a single susceptible site, the transition will occur when the energy released exceeds the energy required to perform the transition (4Benham C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In domains that contain multiple sites that are susceptible to transition, a complex competition among them will occur (1Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Whether a specific transition occurs depends not just on its local sequence but also on how well that transition competes with all others elsewhere in the domain. For example, David Lilley and colleagues (2Aboul-ela F. Bowater R.P. Lilley D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1776-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the melting transition of an A + T-rich region contained within a supercoiled DNA plasmid required a significantly higher level of negative supercoiling when a (TG)12 region able to form left-handed Z-DNA under superhelical tension was inserted into the plasmid. This shows that the presence of a more susceptible site can inhibit less favorable transitions at other positions. In other words, superhelix-induced structures compete with one another for the negative superhelical energy required for their formation. The transition behavior of superhelical domains also may be influenced by proteins that bind at or near these transition sites. For example, if a DNA region that is favored to form a superhelix-induced alternate structure is trapped in the B-form by the binding of a protein, the transition may be transferred to another region in the domain. If this second site is the −10 region of a promoter, this translocation of destabilization of the B-form can be used to activate transcription initiation by facilitating open promoter complex formation. In this report, we present evidence for this type of a DNA structural transmission mechanism for the regulation of gene expression inEscherichia coli.

This activation occurs in the absence of specific protein interactions between IHF and RNA polymerase, is not the consequence of a DNA looping mechanism, and requires a superhelical DNA template (6Pagel J.M.

IHF binding in the UAS1 region of a superhelical DNA template results in duplex destabilization in the −10 region of the downstream ilvPGpromoter site. This DNA structural change at the downstream promoter site is correlated with an increase in the rate of open complex formation and a concomitant increase in the rate of transcription initiation (7Parekh B.S.

In this report, (i) we provide theoretical evidence for a supercoiling-induced DNA duplex destabilized (SIDD) structure in the A + T-rich, ilvPG regulatory promoter region between bp positions +1 and −162; (ii) we present experimental evidence to show that the local B-form DNA structure in the UAS1 region immediately upstream of the IHF binding site is destabilized by superhelical stress; (iii) we show that IHF binding prevents this duplex destabilization; (iv) we show that the threshold superhelical densities required for IHF activation and for the destabilization of this upstream portion of the SIDD region in UAS1 are similar; and (v) we demonstrate that the presence of this upstream destabilized structure is required for IHF activation and IHF-mediated duplex destabilization in the −10 region of the downstream promoter. These observations suggest a novel, superhelically dependent DNA structural transmission mechanism of the type described above; i.e.binding of IHF prevents the superhelical destabilization of the upstream region but promotes duplex destabilization in the −10 region of the ilvPG promoter at the other end of the SIDD structure. This IHF-mediated duplex destabilization in the −10 region of the ilvPG promoter lowers the energy of activation for open complex formation and increases the rate of transcription initiation (7Parekh B.S. Hatfield G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This mechanism accounts for the facts that IHF activation of transcription from theilvPG promoter is DNA supercoiling-dependent and occurs in the absence of specific interactions with RNA polymerase. integration host factor upstream activating sequence supercoiling-induced duplex destabilization base pair(s) linking number difference superhelical density. integration host factor upstream activating sequence supercoiling-induced duplex destabilization base pair(s) linking number difference superhelical density.

The radiolabeled DNA (1 × 10−11m final concentration) was preincubated with purified IHF in a 20-μl assay mixture (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mm MgCl2, 70 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol). The free IHF concentration in each sample was assumed to be the same as the total IHF concentration, since the DNA template concentration was significantly lower than the Kdfor IHF binding. DNA fragments and IHF were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min, and the free and IHF-bound DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (4.83% acrylamide, 0.17%N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA) (29Sambrook J.

DNase I footprinting assays were performed to determine the location of IHF binding in theilvPG promoter-regulatory region of various constructs contained on a negatively supercoiled DNA template. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (1 × 10−9mfinal concentration; ς = −0.06) was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C in the absence or presence of purified IHF (30 nm final concentration) in the same assay mixture used for the gel mobility shift assays.

The reaction was quenched by two extractions with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol followed by a single extraction with chloroform. The DNA was collected by precipitation with 2-propanol and resuspended in distilled water. The sites of mung bean nuclease sensitivity were resolved using primer extension mapping as described below with single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide primers that anneal to ilv DNA sequences 5′ (ilv bp positions −207 to −187) (9Lawther R.P.

After 5 min, the reaction was stopped by precipitation with isopropyl alcohol, and the DNA pellet was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was dried, resuspended in distilled water, and reprecipitated with isopropyl alcohol. The collected pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, collected, and dried. The final pellet was resuspended in distilled water. The sites of OsO4 modification were resolved using primer extension mapping as described below with the single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide primers described above. 1.0 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA was treated with 3 mm potassium permanganate in a 50-μl reaction (45 mm Tris borate (pH 7.6) and 1 mm EDTA) at 37 °C. After exactly 4 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. The modified DNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and dried. The final pellet was resuspended in distilled water. The sites of KMnO4 modification were resolved using primer extension mapping as described below with the single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide primers described above. The sites of chemical modification and nuclease cleavage described above were mapped by primer extension using T7 DNA polymerase and ilv-specific oligonucleotides. After nuclease or chemical treatment, the DNA plasmid template was denatured in the presence of 200 mm NaOH for 10 min at 37 °C. 100 ng of an oligonucleotide primer was added, and the DNA was renatured with 300 mm NaOAc (pH 5.2). The reannealed DNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, washed once with 70% EtOH, collected, and dried. The DNA pellet was resuspended in reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 20 mmMgCl2; 50 mm NaCl; 300 nm each dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP; 1 mm dithiothreitol; and 10 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3,000 Ci/mmol)). 1 unit of T7 DNA polymerase was preincubated in this reaction mixture for 5 min. The polymerization reaction was initiated with the addition 2.5 μl of buffer containing a 100 μm concentration of each dNTP in distilled water. The reaction was allowed to continue for 5 min at 25 °C until it was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of stop buffer (95% formamide, 5 mm EDTA, 0.025% each bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). In order to determine the base pair location of modified and cleaved sites, primer extension for dideoxy sequencing was performed as described above with 1.0 μg of untreated plasmid DNA and the sameilv-specific oligonucleotide primers except for the addition of the appropriate ddNTP (10 μm) to the initiation buffer. The primer extension products were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (7.6% acrylamide, 0.4%N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) containing 8 m urea in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate (pH 8.0), 1 mmEDTA) and visualized by autoradiography following exposure of the gels to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70 °C in the presence of a Cronex Quanta III intensifying screen (DuPont). The closed circular supercoiled plasmids pDHΔwt and pSSΔ98 (Table I) were used as DNA templates forin vitro transcription assays performed in the absence and presence of purified IHF protein. RNA polymerase-plasmid DNA complexes were formed by preincubating 0.5 units (1.2 pmol) of RNA polymerase and 250 ng of plasmid DNA (0.1 pmol) in a 45-μl reaction mixture (0.04m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m KCl, 0.01m MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 200 μm CTP, 20 μm UTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 40 units of RNasin) for 10 min at 25 °C. Transcription reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of a 2 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP solution. Reactions were terminated after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min by removing a 10-μl sample into 10 μl of stop solution (95% formamide, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol). The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (7.6% acrylamide, 0.4% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) containing 8m urea in TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography following exposure of the gels to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70 °C in the presence of a Cronex Quanta III intensifying screen (DuPont). 10 μg of each plasmid was treated with 20 units of Drosophila melanogastertopoisomerase II in a 40-μl reaction mixture (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and ethidium bromide (0–20 μm)) for 5 h. Each plasmid DNA sample was extracted three times with phenol to remove the ethidium bromide, precipitated with 2 volumes of isopropyl alcohol, and resuspended in 100 μl of TE (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA). The plasmid DNA topoisomers were resolved by electrophoresis on four 1.4% agarose gels in TAE buffer containing 0.006, 0.02, 0.04, or 0.08 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The average linking number difference of the DNA plasmid in each sample (ΔLk) was determined by the band counting methods of Keller (31Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4876-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and Singleton and Wells (32Singleton C.K. Wells R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 122: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The average superhelical density (−ς) was calculated using the equation ς = −10.5(ΔLk/N), where N is the number of base pairs in the plasmid (pDHΔwt and pSSΔ98 contain 4203 and 3860 bp, respectively). A 20-μl sample containing a mixture of 0.2 μg of each topoisomer set created above was mixed with 2 μl of a stock loading buffer containing 50% glycerol and 10 mg/ml xylene cyanol. This topoisomer mixture typically contained plasmid DNAs with superhelical densities ranging from ς = 0.00 to approximately ς = −0.10. The sample was loaded into a single circular well (radius = 2 mm) of 24 × 24-cm 1.4% agarose gels prepared with 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA). Electrophoresis of each gel in the first dimension was performed in 0.5× TBE buffer at 2.5 V/cm at 37 °C for 28 h with constant buffer recirculation at a rate of at least 1 liter/h. Each gel was removed and soaked in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1.0 mm EDTA) containing different amounts of interchelating dye (0.02–0.08 μg/ml ethidium bromide) for 6–8 h. Each gel was electrophoresed in a direction 90° to the first dimension in the running buffer used to soak the gel. DNA supercoil-dependent structures were evaluated as described by Bowater et al. (12Bowater R. Aboul-ela F. Lilley D.M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The transition properties of superhelical DNA molecules were calculated using a statistical mechanical analysis that evaluates the equilibrium properties of a population of identical, superhelically stressed DNA molecules in which every base pair is regarded as being susceptible to denaturation (1Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Benham C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Benham C.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1990; 92: 6294-6305Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All states are examined individually, and the cumulative influence of the high energy states is estimated by a density of states calculation. In each state, the superhelical constraint is divided among three deformations, the change of helicity consequent to denaturing the collection of base pairs that are open in that state, helical interwinding of the two strands comprising the resulting denatured region(s), and the residual superhelicity that remains to stress the molecule. The free energies associated with these deformations have been determined by experimental observation. Copolymeric denaturation energetics are assumed, in which the free energy of opening a base pair depends only on whether it is AT or GC. The other energy parameters are given the values that have been found to pertain under experimental conditions in which T = 37 °C, pH = 7.0, and the DNA is placed in a low ionic strength buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mmNa2EDTA. Under these experimental conditions, comparison with experimental observations has shown the results of these calculations to be quantitatively accurate. We note that the pH and ionic conditions of the OsO4 and nuclease digestion experiments reported here are somewhat different that those assumed in the calculations. Here the results of calculations are depicted as destabilization profiles. The free energy G(x) that is required to assure opening of the base pair at position x is calculated for each position in the DNA sequence. Low values ofG(x) occur at positions where the base pair is substantially destabilized, whereas high values are found when the base pair is not destabilized by the imposed superhelical stresses. Destabilization profiles provide more information than plots of opening probability versus position, because they also show sites where the duplex is substantially destabilized but not sufficiently to cause denaturation with high probability. Such sites can be biologically important if another process or molecule can provide only an incremental amount of free energy to the opening reaction. The base pair composition of theilvPG promoter-regulatory region is exceptionally A + T-rich (Fig. 1). The 80-bp segment from bp positions −67 to −153 is approximately 88% A + T (9Lawther R.P. Wek R.C. Lopes J.M. Pereira R. Taillon B.E. Hatfield G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2137-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In order to predict the stability of this region under superhelical stress, DNA SIDD profiles (1Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Benham C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were calculated for plasmid pDHΔwt. This plasmid contains theilvPG promoter region from bp position −248 to +6 (9Lawther R.P. Wek R.C. Lopes J.M. Pereira R. Taillon B.E. Hatfield G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2137-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in a pBR322-based vector containing transcriptional terminators located downstream of the ilvPG start site (Table I). Calculations were performed using the energy parameters appropriate for the nuclease digestion procedure of Kowalski (1Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Kowalski D. Natale D.A. Eddy M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9464-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The results of these calculations are presented in Fig. 2, A andB. These are destabilization profiles, plots of the incremental free energy, G(x), required to guarantee denaturation of the base pair at position x. The smaller the value of G(x), the greater the destabilization experienced by that base pair. Values near 0 occur at sites where the B-form DNA base pair interactions are almost completely destabilized. The calculation profiles show that the DNA duplex in the UAS1 region is predicted to be destabilized in this plasmid at a physiological superhelical density of ς = −0.05. In fact, the predicted DNA destabilization of the UAS1 region in this plasmid context is even more pronounced than the well characterized melting transition of the A + T-rich sequence around bp position 3100 in the 3′-region of the β-lactamase gene (3Kowalski D. Natale D.A. Eddy M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9464-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A close up view of the UAS1-ilvPG promoter region of this SIDD profile is shown in Fig. 2 C. These data show that the DNA duplex in the promoter region is predicted to be more stable than it is in the upstream UAS1 region.Figure 2SIDD profile of plasmid pDHΔwt at ΔLk = −20 turns (ς = −0.05).

DEAD box proteins are a family of putative RNA helicases that are characterized by eight conserved amino acid motifs, one of which is the ATP hydrolysis motif containing the core amino acid sequence DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) (1Linder P.

Many of the DEAD box proteins found in higher eukaryotes are tissue- or stage-specific.

The longest DDX1 cDNA insert isolated from this library was 2.4 kb with an open reading frame from position 1 to 2201. All eight conserved motifs characteristic of DEAD box proteins are found in the predicted amino acid sequence of DDX1 as well as a region with homology to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, a protein believed to participate in the processing of heterogeneous nuclear RNA to mRNA (22Kiledjian M.

The proto-oncogene MYCN encodes a member of the MYC family of transcription factors that bind to an E box element (CACGTG) when dimerized with the MAX protein (24Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N.

Nature. 1992; 359: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The MYCN gene is amplified and overexpressed in approximately one-third of all NB tumors (26Brodeur G.M. Seeger R.C. Schwab M.

MYCN overexpression is usually achieved by increasing gene copy number rather than by up-regulating basal expression of MYCN (27Seeger R.C. Brodeur G.M. Sather H. Dalton A. Siegel S.E. Wong K.Y.

Genet. 1982; 16: 21-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 30Zehnbauer B.A. Small D. Brodeur G.M. Seeger R. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell.

TheDDX1 gene maps to the same chromosomal band asMYCN, 2p24, and is located ∼400 kb telomeric to theMYCN gene (33Amler L.C. Schürmann J. Schwab M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), 2R. Godbout, unpublished results. while approximately two-thirds of NB cell lines and 38–68% of NB tumors are co-amplified for both genes (37Manohar C.F. Salwen H.R. Brodeur G.M. Cohn S.L.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1583-1587PubMed Google Scholar) found a significant decrease in the mean disease-free survival of patients withDDX1/MYCN-amplified NB tumors compared withMYCN-amplified tumors. Similarly, Squire et al. (38Squire J.A. Thorner P.S. Weitzman S. Maggi J.D. Dirks P. Doyle J. Hale M. Godbout R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1417-1422PubMed Google Scholar) observed a trend toward a worse clinical prognosis when both genes were amplified in the tumors of NB patients. To date, there have been no reports of a tumor amplified only for DDX1, and the role that this gene plays in cancer formation and progression is not known. Because of the high rate of rearrangements in amplified DNA (31Akiyama K. Nishi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6887-6894Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 40Reiter J.L. Brodeur G.M. Genomics. 1996; 32: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that a gene located ∼400 kb from the MYCNgene will be consistently amplified as an intact unit unless its product provides a growth advantage to the cell. Based on Southern blot analysis, the DDX1 gene extends over more than 30 kb, and there are no gross rearrangements of this gene inDDX1-amplified tumors (21Godbout R. Squire J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 38Squire J.A. Thorner P.S. Weitzman S. Maggi J.D. Dirks P. Doyle J. Hale M. Godbout R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1417-1422PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is a good correlation between DDX1 transcript levels and gene copy number in the tumors analyzed to date. However, we need to show that DDX1 protein is overexpressed in DDX1-amplified tumors if we are to entertain the possibility that this protein plays a role in the tumorigenic process. Here, we isolate and characterize the 5′-end ofDDX1 mRNA and extend the DDX1 cDNA sequence by ∼300 nt. We identify the predicted initiation codon of DDX1 and generate antisera that specifically recognize DDX1 protein. We analyze levels of DDX1 protein in both DDX1-amplified and nonamplified RB and NB tumors and study the subcellular location of this protein in the cell. A human fetal brain cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened using a 320-bp DNA fragment from the 5′-end of the 2.4-kb DDX1 cDNA previously described (23Godbout R. Hale M. Bisgrove D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 138: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Phagemids containing positive inserts were excised from λ ZAP II following the supplier's directions. The ends of the cDNA inserts were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A human placenta genomic library (CLONTECH) was screened with the 5′-end of DDX1 cDNA. Positive plaques were purified, and the genomic DNA was analyzed using restriction enzymes and Southern blotting. EcoRI-digested DNA fragments from these clones were subcloned into pBluescript and digested with exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease to obtain sequentially deleted clones. The exon/intron map of the 5′ portion of the DDX1gene was obtained by comparing the sequence of DDX1 cDNA with that of the genomic DNA. We used the AmpliFINDER RACE kit (CLONTECH) to extend the 5′-end of DDX1 cDNA. Briefly, two μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from RB522A was reverse transcribed at 52 °C using either primer P1 or P3 (Fig. 1 A). The RNA template was hydrolyzed, and excess primer was removed. A single-stranded AmpliFINDER anchor containing an EcoRI site was ligated to the 3′-end of the cDNA using T4 RNA ligase. The cDNA was amplified using either primer P2 or P4 (Fig.1 A) and AmpliFINDER anchor primer. RACE products were cloned into pBluescript. Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from RB and NB cell lines as described previously (21Godbout R. Squire J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 38Squire J.A. Thorner P.S. Weitzman S. Maggi J.D. Dirks P. Doyle J. Hale M. Godbout R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1417-1422PubMed Google Scholar). The 21-nt primers 5′-TTCGTTCTGGGCACCATGTGT-3′ (primer P4 in Fig. 1 A) and 5′-TGGGACCTAGGGCTTCTGGAC-3′ (primer P3 in Fig. 1 A) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Mandel Scientific) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Each of the labeled primers was annealed to 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA at 45 °C for 90 min, and the cDNA was extended at 42 °C for 60 min using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The primer extension products were heat-denatured and run on a 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 1× TBE buffer. A G + A sequencing ladder served as the size standard. The S1 nuclease protection assay to map the transcription initiation site of DDX1 was performed as described by Favaloro et al. (41Favaloro J. Treisman R. Kamen R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 718-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). The DNA probe was prepared by digesting genomic DNA spanning the upstream region of DDX1 and exon 1 with AvaI, labeling the ends with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and polynucleotide kinase, and removing the label from one of the ends by digesting the DNA with SphI (Fig. 4). The RNA samples were resuspended in a hybridization mixture containing 80% formamide, 40 mmPIPES, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and the heat-denatured SphI–AvaI probe labeled at theAvaI site. The samples were incubated at 45 °C for 16 h and digested with 3000 units/ml S1 nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) for 60 min at 37 °C. The samples were precipitated with ethanol; resuspended in 80% formaldehyde, TBE buffer, 0.1% bromphenol blue, xylene cyanol; denatured at 90 °C for 2 min; and electrophoresed in a 7 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer. Poly(A)+RNAs were isolated from RB and NB cell lines as described previously (21Godbout R. Squire J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 38Squire J.A. Thorner P.S. Weitzman S. Maggi J.D. Dirks P. Doyle J. Hale M. Godbout R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1417-1422PubMed Google Scholar). Two μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane were electrophoresed in a 6% formaldehyde, 1.5% agarose gel in MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) and transferred to nitrocellulose filter in 3 m sodium chloride, 0.3 m sodium citrate. The filters were hybridized to the following DNA probes,32P-labeled by nick translation: (i) a 1.6-kbEcoRI insert from DDX1 cDNA clone 1042 (21Godbout R. Squire J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), (ii) a 260-bp cDNA fragment spanning the 3′-end of DDX1exon 1 as well as exons 2 and 3, (iii) a 160-bp fragment derived from the 5′-end of DDX1 exon 1, and (iv) α-actin cDNA to control for lane to lane variation in RNA levels. Filters were hybridized and washed under high stringency. Southern blot analysis was as described previously (21Godbout R. Squire J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To prepare antiserum to the C terminus of the DDX1 protein, we inserted a 1.8-kbEcoRI fragment from bp 848 to 2668 ofDDX1 cDNA (Fig. 1 B) intoEcoRI-digested pMAL-c2 expression vector (New England Biolabs). DH5α cells transformed with this vector were grown to mid-log phase and induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-thiogalactoside. The cells were harvested 3–4 h postinduction and lysed by sonication. Soluble maltose binding protein-DDX1 fusion protein was affinity-purified using amylose resin, and the maltose-binding protein was cleaved with factor Xa. The DDX1 protein was purified on a SDS-PAGE gel, electroeluted, and concentrated. Approximately 100 μg of protein was injected into rabbits at 4–6-week intervals. For the initial injection, the protein was dispersed in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma), while subsequent injections were prepared in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Blood was collected from each rabbit 10 days after injection, and the specificity of the antiserum was tested using cell extracts from RB522A. To prepare antiserum to the N terminus of DDX1 protein, a DDX1 cDNA fragment from bp 268 to 851 (Fig. 1 B) was inserted into pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant protein produced from this construct contains the first 186 amino acids of the predicted DDX1 sequence. Soluble glutathione S-transferase-DDX1 fusion protein was purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The glutathione S-transferase component of the fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin. We used two different procedures for subcellular fractionations. First, we isolated nuclear and S100 (soluble cytoplasmic) fractions from RB522A, IMR-32, Y79, RB(E)-2, HeLa, and HL60 using the procedure of Dignam (42Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). On average, we obtained 5–6 times more protein in the cytosolic fractions than in the nuclear fractions. Second, 108 RB522A cells were lysed and fractionated into S4 (soluble cytoplasmic components), P2 (heavy mitochondria, plasma membrane fragments), P3 (mitochondria, lysozymes, peroxisomes, and Golgi membranes), and P4 fractions (membrane vesicles from rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and plasma membrane) by differential centrifugation (43Graham J. Rickwood D. Centrifugation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press, Oxford1984: 161-182Google Scholar). We obtained 8 mg of protein in the S4 fraction, 1 mg in P2, 0.5 mg in P3, and 2 mg in P4 fraction. The procedures related to the immunoelectron microscopy have been previously described (44Godbout R. Marusyk H. Bisgrove D. Dabbagh L. Poppema S. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, proteins were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide-SDS gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose using the standard protocol for protein transfer described by Schleicher and Schuell. The filters were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of DDX1 antiserum, a 1:200 dilution of anti-MYCN monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim), or a 1:200 dilution of anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). For the colorimetric analysis, antigen-antibody interactions were visualized using either alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (for DDX1) or goat anti-mouse IgG (for MYCN) at a 1:3000 dilution. For the ECL Western blotting analysis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), we used a 1:100,000 dilution of peroxidase-linked secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody (for DDX1) or secondary anti-goat IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). We have previously reported the sequence of DDX1 cDNA isolated from an RB cDNA library (21Godbout R. Squire J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Godbout R. Hale M. Bisgrove D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 138: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This 2.4-kb DDX1cDNA contains an open reading frame spanning positions 1–2201 with a methionine encoded by the first three nucleotides (Fig.1 A). There is a polyadenylation signal and poly(A) tail in the 3′-untranslated region, indicating that the sequence is complete at the 3′-end. Manoharet al. (37Manohar C.F. Salwen H.R. Brodeur G.M. Cohn S.L. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1995; 14: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have also isolated DDX1 cDNA from the NB cell line LA-N-5. Their cDNA extended the 5′-end of our sequence by 42 bp and included an additional in frame methionine (double underlined in Fig. 1 A). The possibility of additional in frame methionines located further upstream could not be excluded, because there were no predicted stop codons in the upstream region of the cDNA. Northern blot analysis indicated a DDX1 transcript size of ∼2800 nt, suggesting that the DDX1 cDNAs isolated to date were lacking ∼300–350 bp of 5′ sequence. We have used different approaches to identify the transcription start site of DDX1. First, we exhaustively screened a commercial fetal brain cDNA library with the 5′-end of DDX1 cDNA. Although numerous clones were analyzed, only one extended the sequence (by 35 bp) beyond that published by Manohar et al. (37Manohar C.F. Salwen H.R. Brodeur G.M. Cohn S.L. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1995; 14: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). We next used the RACE procedure in an attempt to isolate additional 5′ sequence. The nested primers used to amplify the 5′-end of theDDX1 transcript are labeled as primers P1 and P2 in Fig.1 A and are located downstream of the three in frame methionines (double underlined in Fig. 1 A). Poly(A)+ RNA from RB522A was reverse transcribed at 52 °C using primer P1, and the reverse transcribed cDNA was amplified using the nested primer P2 and the 5′-RACE primer. Using this approach, we generated a product that was 230 bp longer than any of the cDNAs obtained by screening libraries (Fig. 1 A). Sequencing of this 230-bp cDNA revealed an in frame stop codon (boldface double underline in Fig. 1 A) located 123 bp upstream of the predicted translation initiation site. We then prepared primers P3 and P4, located near the 5′-end of the RACE cDNA (Fig. 1 A) and repeated the RACE procedure to see if additional 5′ sequences could be obtained. The resulting RACE products did not extend the DDX1 cDNA sequence further. The location of the DDX1 transcription initiation site was verified by primer extension. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from the following two cell lines: DDX1-amplified RB cell line RB522A and a nonamplified RB cell line RB(E)-2. RB522A has elevated levels of DDX1 mRNA, while RB(E)-2 has at least 20-fold lower levels of this transcript. Three products of 40, 43, and 46 nt (with a weak signal at 45 nt) were detected in RB522A using primer P4 (Figs. 1 A and 2). The 40-nt product corresponded exactly with the 5′-end of the RACE-derived cDNA while the 43- and 46-nt products extended the predicted size of the DDX1 transcript by 3 and 6 nt, respectively. None of these products were observed in RB(E)-2. Bands of identical sizes to those obtained with RB522A mRNA were also observed in the DDX1-amplified NB cell line BE(2)-C but not in the DDX1-amplified NB cell line IMR-32 (data not shown). The same predicted DDX1 transcription initiation site was identified with primer P3 except that the bands were of weaker intensity (data not shown). We have designated the transcription start site identified by primer extension as +1 (Fig. 1 A). The sequence of the 6 nt extending beyond the RACE cDNA was obtained by comparison of the cDNA sequence with that ofDDX1 genomic DNA. Bacteriophages containing DDX1genomic DNA were isolated by screening a human placenta library with 5′DDX1 cDNA. Eighteen kb of DNA were sequenced from two bacteriophages with overlapping DDX1 genomic DNA. Thirteen exons were identified within this 18-kb region (Fig.3) corresponding to cDNA sequences from position 1 to 1249. The 310-bp exon 1 was by far the longest of the 13 exons sequenced, corresponding to the entire 5′-untranslated region of DDX1 as well as the first in frame methionine. The sequences transcribed from exons 1, 2, and 3 are indicated in Fig.1 A. Knowledge of the genomic structure of DDX1 allowed us to use the S1 protection assay, a technique that is independent of reverse transcriptase, to further define the 5′-end of the DDX1transcript. Poly(A)+ RNAs from sixDDX1-amplified lines (RB lines: Y79 and RB522A; NB lines: BE(2)-C, IMR-32, LA-N-1, and LA-N-5) and six nonamplified lines (RB lines: RB(E)-2 and RB412; NB lines, GOTO, NB-1, NUB-7, and SK-N-MC) were hybridized to a DNA probe that extended from position −745 in the 5′-flanking DDX1 DNA to position +164 in exon 1. This DNA probe was labeled at position +164 as indicated in Fig.4. Nonhybridized DNA was digested with S1 nuclease, and the sizes of the protected fragments were analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Bands of 150–153 nt were observed inlane 2 (RB522A), lane 5(BE(2)-C), and lane 8 (LA-N-1) with bands of much weaker intensity in lane 7 (IMR-32) (Fig. 4). Specific bands were not detected in either DDX1-amplified Y79 and LA-N-5 or the nonamplified lines. Although the sizes of the S1 protected bands in RB522A, BE(2)-C, and LA-N-1 were 5 and 11 nt shorter than predicted based on RACE and primer extensions, respectively, there was general agreement with all three techniques regarding the location of the DDX1 transcription initiation site (Fig.1 A). The smaller S1 nuclease protected products could have arisen as the result of S1 digestion of the 5′-end of the RNA:DNA heteroduplex because of its relatively high rU:dA content (45Miller K.G. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1981; 27: 165-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Identification of the same transcription initiation site in threeDDX1-amplified lines suggests that this represents the bona fide start site of DDX1 transcription. However, it was not clear why this start site was either very weak or not detected in three other amplified lines. To determine whether the 5′-end of exon 1 is transcribed in all DDX1-amplified lines, we carried out a direct analysis of the 5′-end of the DDX1 transcript by Northern blotting. Two probes were used for this analysis: the 5′ probe contained a 160-bp fragment from bp 1 to 160 (5′-half of exon 1), and the 3′ probe contained a 260-bp fragment from bp 160 to 420 (3′-half of exon 1 as well exons 2 and 3) (Fig. 1 A). With the 3′ probe, we obtained bands of similar size and intensity in fourDDX1-amplified lines (RB522A, BE(2)-C, IMR-32, and LA-N-5). Band intensity was somewhat weaker in Y79 and stronger in LA-N-1 in comparison with the other lines (Fig. 5). No signal was detected in the non-DDX1-amplified line RB412. With the 5′ probe, a relatively strong signal was observed in RB522A, BE(2)-C, and LA-N-1, while a considerably weaker but readily apparent signal was detected in Y79, IMR-32, and LA-N-5. The signal obtained with actin indicates that, with the exception of LA-N-1,"
https://openalex.org/W1987909719,"We have investigated the role of the cytoplasmic tail (C-tail) of the human somatostatin receptor type 5 (hSSTR5) in regulating receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase (AC) and in mediating agonist-dependent desensitization and internalization responses. Mutant receptors with progressive C-tail truncation (Δ347, Δ338, Δ328, Δ318), Cys320→ Ala substitution (to block palmitoylation), or Tyr304→ Ala substitution of a putative NPXXY internalization motif were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells. Except for the Tyr304 → Ala mutant, which showed no binding, all other mutant receptors exhibited binding characteristics (Kd and Bmax) and G protein coupling comparable with wild type (wt) hSSTR5. The C-tail truncation mutants displayed progressive reduction in coupling to AC, with the Δ318 mutant showing complete loss of effector coupling. Agonist pretreatment of wt hSSTR5 led to uncoupling of AC inhibition, whereas the desensitization response of the C-tail deletion mutants was variably impaired. Compared with internalization (66% at 60 min) of wt hSSTR5, truncation of the C-tail to 318, 328, and 338 residues reduced receptor internalization to 46, 46, and 23%, respectively, whereas truncation to 347 residues slightly improved internalization (72%). Mutation of Cys320 → Ala induced a reduction in AC coupling, desensitization, and internalization. These studies show that the C-tail of hSSTR5 serves a multifunctional role in mediating effector coupling, desensitization, and internalization. Whereas coupling to AC is dependent on the length of the C-tail, desensitization and internalization require specific structural domains. Furthermore, internalization is regulated through both positive and negative molecular signals in the C-tail and can be dissociated from the signaling and acute desensitization responses of the receptor.

These actions are mediated by a family of five G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with seven α helical transmembrane segments termed SSTR1–5 (2Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 398-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). All five SSTRs inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Some of the receptor isotypes also modulate other effectors such as phosphotyrosine phosphatase, K+ and Ca2+ ion channels, a Na +/H + exchanger, phospholipase C, phospholipase A2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (2Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 398-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The five SSTRs display an overlapping pattern of expression throughout the brain and in peripheral organs (2Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Trends Endocrinol.

An important property of many GPCRs is their ability to regulate their responsiveness in the presence of continued agonist exposure (6Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Such agonist-specific regulation by GPCRs involves a series of discrete cellular steps that include loss of binding affinity and signaling capability due to receptor uncoupling from G proteins (desensitization), receptor internalization, and receptor degradation. Like other GPCRs, SSTRs also appear to be dynamically regulated at the membrane by agonist treatment (2Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 398-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For instance, during pharmacotherapy with SST analogs in man, the acute effects on pituitary islet and gastric functions subside with continued exposure to the peptide due to the development of tolerance (7Lamberts S.W.J. Van Der Lely A.J. de Herder W.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Agonist-dependent internalization of SSTRs occurs in rat pituitary and islet cells and in AtT-20 cells (8Morel G. Leroux P. Pelletier G. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Amherdt M. Patel Y.C. Orci L. J. Clin.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3698-3706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In GH4C1 and Rin m5f cells, however, prolonged agonist treatment up-regulates SSTRs (11Sullivan S.J. Schonbrunn A. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,12Presky D.H. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 714-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences may be explained by differential expression of SSTR subtypes since AtT-20 cells express predominantly the SSTR5 subtype, whereas GH4C1 cells are rich in the SSTR1 isotype (13Patel Y.C.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5070-5075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, because pituitary and islet cells or their tumor cell derivatives express multiple SSTR subtypes, it is difficult to determine subtype-selective responses in these systems (4Day R. Dong W. Panetta R. Kraicer J. Greenwood M.T. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5232-5235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Kumar U. Laird D. Srikant C.B. Escher E. Patel Y.C.

To circumvent these problems, several recent studies have characterized agonist regulation of individual SSTRs using subtype-selective SST analogs or cell lines stably transfected with SSTR cDNAs (10Hofland L.J.

Very little is currently known about the molecular determinants of the desensitization and internalization responses of the SSTR family. For other GPCRs, the presence in the C-tail of Ser and Thr phosphorylation sites as well as Tyr internalization signals is critically important in these processes (6Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 19Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have characterized by mutagenesis the structural domains in the C-tail of hSSTR5 necessary for agonist-dependent desensitization and internalization. We show that the C-tail of hSSTR5 is critical for internalization, receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase, and acute desensitization responses. Although internalization and signaling both require the C-tail, they are independent functions of the receptor, which appear to be residue-specific in the case of internalization, or dependent on the length of the C-tail for coupling to adenylyl cyclase. SST-28 and Leu8-d-Trp22-Tyr25SST-28 (LTT SST-28) were from Bachem (Marina Del Rey, CA). The fluorescent SST ligand, α-fluoresceinyl-[d-Trp8] SST-14 (fluo-SST) was from Advanced Bioconcept, Montreal, Quebec. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, bacitracin, and GTPγS were from Sigma. Pertussis toxin was from List Biological Laboratories. Ham's F-12 medium, fetal bovine serum, and G418 were from Life Technologies, Inc.. Carrier-free Na125I was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rhodamine-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG was from Jackson Immunoresearch Labs (West Grove, PA). Cyclic AMP radioimmunoassay kits were obtained from Diagnostic Products Corp. (Los Angeles, CA). All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from various suppliers. A hSSTR5 cassette gene consisting of five cDNA fragments corresponding to consecutive segments of hSSTR5 was created as described previously by introducing silent mutations to generate unique restriction sites to facilitate the manipulation of the sequence as discrete restriction fragments (20Greenwood M.T. Hukovic N. Kumar U. Panetta R. Hjorth S.A. Srikant C.B. Patel Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using this construct, a series of point mutations in the C-tail of hSSTR5 were created to investigate the role of the length and of specific residues in the signaling, desensitization, and internalization properties of the receptor (Fig. 1). The wt hSSTR5 cytoplasmic tail (C-tail) contains 55 amino acid residues with 7 serine and threonine residues that could serve as putative phosphorylation sites. Stop codons were introduced at positions 318, 328, 338, and 347 to produce truncated receptors with variable length C-tail. The Δ318 truncation contains only 10 amino acid residues, with one serine residue at position 314. The Δ328 contains 20 amino acid residues in the C-tail and incorporates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site at Ser325. The Δ338 truncation contains 30 amino acid residues in the C-tail. The Δ347 mutant contains 39 amino acid residues and includes the342QQQEAT347 motif, a putative G protein receptor kinase phosphorylation site. A palmitoylation site on a conserved Cys residue present in the C-tail of many GPCRs has been shown to be important for receptor sequestration. Such a site is present on Cys320 of hSSTR5 and was mutated to Ala. The Tyr residue in the NPXnY motif located at the junction of the VIIth transmembrane (TM) helix and the C-tail acts as an internalization signal for a number of G protein-coupled receptors. This motif exists in hSSTR5 as NPVLY and was mutated at the Tyr304 position to Ala. Desired mutations were introduced into the MluI-EcoRI fragment of the cassette construct (20Greenwood M.T. Hukovic N. Kumar U. Panetta R. Hjorth S.A. Srikant C.B. Patel Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Point mutations were created using the PCR overlap extension technique; for the C-tail-truncated mutants, oligonucleotide primers were used that contain an appropriately placed stop codon (20Greenwood M.T. Hukovic N. Kumar U. Panetta R. Hjorth S.A. Srikant C.B. Patel Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mutated DNA fragments were used to replace the corresponding wild type restriction fragment in the cassette construct in the expression vector pTEJ8. The structure of the cassette construct and the mutated cDNAs was confirmed by sequence analysis (University Core DNA Service, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). CHO-K1 cells were transfected with cDNAs for wild type or mutant receptors by the Lipofectin method, and stable G418- resistant nonclonally selected cells were prepared for study. CHO-K1 cells expressing wild type and mutant hSSTR5 were cultured to ∼70% confluency in D-75 flasks in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 700 μg/ml G418. The cells were washed and pelleted by centrifugation, and membranes were prepared by homogenization. Binding studies were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C with 20–40 μg of membrane protein and125I-LTT SST-28 radioligand as described previously (13Patel Y.C. Panetta R. Escher E. Greenwood M.T. Srikant C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1506-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Greenwood M.T. Hukovic N. Kumar U. Panetta R. Hjorth S.A. Srikant C.B. Patel Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine G protein coupling of the expressed receptors, the effect of treatment with 10−4m GTPγS for 30 min on 125I-LTT SST-28 binding to membranes from cells expressing wild type and mutant SSTRs was evaluated. In addition, binding was analyzed after pretreatment of membranes with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C to determine pertussis toxin sensitivity of the receptor-bound G proteins. Transfected cells were plated in Falcon 6-well dishes (2 × 105cells/well) and used two days later at ∼70% confluency. Receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase was investigated by measuring the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of SST-28 on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Cells were exposed to 1 μm forskolin with or without SST-28 (10−6–10−10m) for 30 min at 37 °C, scraped in 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1 n HCl, and assayed for cAMP by radioimmunoassay. To study agonist-dependent desensitization of adenylyl cyclase response, cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in binding buffer with or without 100 nm SST-28. The cells were then washed twice with cold binding buffer to remove unbound SST-28. Receptor-bound SST-28 was then stripped by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C in Hanks' buffered saline acidified to pH 5.0 with 20 mm sodium acetate (acid wash). The cells were washed twice and analyzed along with control cells for receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase. Cultured CHO-K1 cells expressing wild type and mutant SSTRs were incubated overnight at 4 °C in binding buffer with 125I-LTT SST-28 (200,000 cpm) with or without 100 nm SST-28 (15Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4046-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold HEPES binding buffer containing 5% Ficoll to remove unbound ligand and then warmed to 37 °C for different times (0, 15, 30, and 60 min) to initiate internalization. Surface-bound radioligand was removed by treatment for 10 min with acid wash solution. Internalized radioligand was measured as acid-resistant counts in 0.1 n NaOH extracts of acid-washed cells. Internalization of receptor-bound ligand was also assessed using fluo-SST. This peptide binds with high affinity (IC50 4.9 nm) to SSTRs in rat cortical homogenate and has been reported to undergo agonist-dependent internalization in COS-7 cells transfected with SSTR2A (16Nouel D. Gaudriault G. Houle M. Reisine T. Vincent J-P Mazella J. Beaudet A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells expressing wild type and mutant hSSTR5 receptors were grown to ∼70% confluency. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed and incubated in 1 ml of binding buffer containing 10 nm fluo-SST at 4 °C for 1–2 h. To examine internalization, sister cultures were incubated with fluo-SST under identical conditions for 45 min at 37 °C. At the end of each incubation, media were removed, and the cells were washed, mounted in immunofluor, and viewed under a Zeiss LSM 410 inverted confocal microscope (5Kumar U. Laird D. Srikant C.B. Escher E. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4473-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Greenwood M.T. Hukovic N. Kumar U. Panetta R. Hjorth S.A. Srikant C.B. Patel Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All images were archived on a Bernoulli multidisc and printed on Kodak XLS8300 high resolution printer. Confocal immunofluorescence studies were performed to confirm cell surface expression of the Tyr304 → Ala mutant in live unfixed transfected cells using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the amino-terminal 4–11 peptide sequence of hSSTR5 as described previously (5Kumar U. Laird D. Srikant C.B. Escher E. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4473-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Greenwood M.T. Hukovic N. Kumar U. Panetta R. Hjorth S.A. Srikant C.B.

Table I shows the results of membrane binding analyses of CHO-K1 cells transfected with wt hSSTR5 cassette cDNA and the hSSTR5 C-tail mutant cDNAs. By saturation analysis, wt hSSTR5 displayed high affinity binding with a Kd of 0.31 nm and aBmax of 162 ± 42 fmol/mg of protein. The Δ328, Δ338, and the Δ347 C-tail truncation mutants as well as the Cys320 → Ala mutants displayed binding affinities of 0.21–0.47 nm, comparable with that of wt hSSTR5. The Δ318 truncation mutant also displayed high affinity ligand binding (Kd 0.89 nm), which, however, was 3-fold lower than that of the wild type receptor. Bmaxof the four C-tail deletion mutants ranged between 247 and 352 fmol/mg of protein, 1.5–2-fold higher than that of wt hSSTR5; theBmax of the Cys320 → Ala mutant (179 ± 51 fmol/mg of protein) was comparable with that of the wild type receptor. No specific binding was observed in membranes prepared from cells transfected with the Tyr304 → Ala mutant. The mutant protein, however, was expressed on the cell membrane as determined by immunocytochemistry using live unfixed cells. Using the hSSTR5 primary antibody, nonpermeabilized CHO-K1 cells expressing wt hSSTR5 showed rhodamine immunofluorescence localized to the cell surface (not shown). Cells transfected with the Tyr304 → Ala mutant also exhibited surface immunofluorescence with this antibody, indicating that the mutant receptor was properly targeted to the plasma membrane. No specific immunofluorescence was detected in nontransfected CHO-K1 cells or in transfected cells probed with preimmune serum or antigen-absorbed primary antibody. To exclude any breach of the plasma membrane and labeling of cytosolic structures beneath the plasmalemna during incubation with primary antibody, parallel immunocytochemistry was performed with antibody to vimentin, an intracellular protein. Under these conditions, vimentin immunoreactivity was detected only in cells permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 but not in intact CHO-K1 cells. These findings suggest that the loss of binding of the Tyr304 → Ala mutant is not due to a failure of the mutant receptor to be localized to the plasma membrane but rather reflects an important structural requirement of the Tyr residue in maintaining a high affinity ligand binding conformation. Loss of agonist binding by this mutant precluded further analysis of the role of the Tyr304 residue as an internalization signal.Table IBinding characteristics of wild type and mutant hSSTR5ReceptorKdBmaxnmfmol/mg of proteinwt hSSTR50.31 ± 0.01162 ± 42Δ318 hSSTR50.89 ± 0.07262 ± 71Δ328 hSSTR50.47 ± 0.16298 ± 99Δ338 hSSTR50.41 ± 0.18247 ± 40Δ347 hSSTR50.21 ± 0.07352 ± 96ΔCys320 → Ala hSSTR50.40 ± 0.12179 ± 51 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the hSSTR5 C-tail mutants were coupled to G proteins, the effect of 10−4m GTPγS on membrane binding was assessed in cells expressing wild type and mutant hSSTR5 receptors (Fig.2). Pretreatment with GTPγS reduced125I-LTT SST-28 binding of wt hSSTR5 to 67 ± 2% that of control. The four C-tail truncation mutants as well as the Cys320 → Ala mutant also displayed significant loss of radioligand binding of 50–70% that of control, comparable with that of the wild type receptor. This suggests that the mutant receptors are capable of associating with G proteins. Pretreatment of membranes with pertussis toxin also led to a significant 40–50% reduction of125I-LTT SST-28 binding to the wild type and the C-tail mutant SSTRs, suggesting that the mutant receptors associate with pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Fig. 3 depicts the results of coupling of the C-tail mutants to adenylyl cyclase. Basal cAMP level in cells expressing the mutant receptors was comparable with that in cells transfected with wt hSSTR5. Compared with the wild type receptor, which showed a maximum of 70 ± 6% inhibition by SST-28 of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, the C-tail deletion mutants displayed a progressive loss of the ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP from 69.8 ± 2% for the Δ347 mutant to 63 ± 3.8% for the Δ338 mutant to 60 ± 3.1% for the Δ328 mutant. The Cys320 → Ala mutant showed only 57 ± 3.4% maximum inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP; the Δ318 showed complete loss of coupling to adenylyl cyclase. To study agonist-dependent desensitization of adenylyl cyclase responses, parallel studies were carried out in sister cultures preincubated with 100 nm SST-28 for 1 h at 37 °C. Surface-bound SST-28 was then removed, and the cells were tested with different concentrations of SST-28 for their ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP. Such agonist pretreatment induced a marked loss of the ability of wt hSSTR5 to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP from 70 ± 6% in control nontreated cells to 21 ± 5% in treated cells (Fig. 4). The mutant receptors that displayed partial loss of efficiency for adenylyl cyclase coupling also showed variable impairment of their uncoupling responses. The Δ328 and Δ347 mutants both retained some ability to uncouple from adenylyl cyclase, although the range of responses for maximum forskolin-stimulated cAMP inhibition before and after agonist pretreatment (60 ± 3.1% and 40 ± 1.2% for Δ328 mutant; 69.8 ± 2% and 45.4 ± 3.3% for Δ 347 mutant) was markedly attenuated compared with the native receptor. The Δ338 mutant displayed virtually complete loss of the ability to uncouple from adenylyl cyclase with agonist preexposure (63 ± 4% and 53 ± 2.3% maximum forskolin-stimulated cAMP inhibition). Like the Δ328 and Δ347 mutants, the Cys320 → Ala mutant retained some ability to uncouple from adenylyl cyclase inhibition with SST-28 pretreatment but with a blunted response (57 ± 3.4% and 43 ± 2.4% maximum forskolin-stimulated cAMP inhibition) compared with the wild type receptor. Internalization of 125I-LTT SST-28 ligand was studied in stably transfected CHO-K1 cells initially treated with ligand for 12 h at 4 °C to allow for equilibrium binding but to limit internalization (Fig. 5). Switching from 4 to 37 °C led to a rapid time-dependent internalization of radioligand that, in the case of wt hSSTR5, reached a maximum of 66 ± 2% at 60 min (Fig. 5). Truncation of the C-tail to 318 and 328 residues produced moderate decreases in receptor internalization to 46% at 60 min. Truncation to 338 residues led to a dramatic loss of radioligand internalization of only 23 ± 3% at 60 min. In contrast, truncation to 347 residues improved the efficiency of internalization even more than that of the wild type receptor (72 ± 3% compared with 66%). This suggests the presence of a positive internalization signal between residues 338 and 347 and a negative signal between 347 and 364 residues and 328 and 338 residues. Mutation of the Cys320 palmitoylation site reduced ligand internalization to 42 ± 3% at 1 h. The extent of the loss of internalization of this mutant was comparable with that of the Δ318 mutant, which also lacked the Cys320 residue and suggests an important function of the palmitoylation anchor in producing the impaired internalization of both these mutant receptors. The pattern of internalization obtained by radioligand binding was confirmed directly with fluo-SST-14 ligand, whose surface binding and endocytosis in transfected CHO-K1 cells was traced by confocal microscopy. Fig. 6 shows confocal fluorescent images of cells incubated with fluo-SST at either 4 °C (left hand panels) to inhibit internalization or at 37 °C (right hand panels) to promote internalization. CHO-K1 cells expressing either the wild type or mutant hSSTRs displayed specific fluorescent labeling at 4 °C that was localized almost exclusively to the cell surface (panel A). Incubation of wt hSSTR5 with fluo-SST at 37 °C resulted in the transfer of the fluorescent ligand to intracellular vesicular structures (panel B). Temperature-dependent internalization of the fluorescent ligand was also observed for the Δ320 (panels C andD) and Δ328 (panels E and F) mutants, although the amount of intracellular labeling was reduced compared with the wild type receptor. In the case of the Δ338 mutant, there was minimal fluorescent labeling of a few intracellular vesicles directly beneath the plasma membrane. Overall, however, this mutant displayed marked inhibition of the ability to endocytose the surface-bound fluorescent ligand (panels G andH). In contrast, the Δ347 mutant exhibited pronounced internalization of fluo-SST-28 at 37 °C, with labeling distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm (panel J). Finally, the Cys320 → Ala mutant displayed the ability to internalize fluo-SST, but the overall efficiency of internalization was impaired compared with the wild type receptor (panel L). Progressive deletion of the C-tail of hSSTR5 had no effect on high affinity ligand binding, indicating that the C-tail, like that of other GPCRs, does not infl"

To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms whereby mutant PS induces overproduction of Aβ42, we constructed cDNAs encoding mutant and/or truncated forms of PS2 and examined the secretion of Aβ42 from COS or neuro2a cells transfected with these genes. Cells expressing full-length PS2 harboring both N141I and M239V mutations in the same polypeptide induced overproduction of Aβ42, although the levels of Aβ42 were comparable with those in cells engineered to express PS2 with one or the other of these PS2 mutations. In contrast, cells engineered to express partially truncated PS2 (eliminating the COOH-terminal third of PS2 while retaining the endoproteolytic NH2-terminal fragment) and harboring a N141I mutation, as well as cells expressing COOH-terminal fragments of PS2, did not overproduce Aβ42, and the levels of Aβ42 were comparable with those in cells that expressed full-length, wild-type PS2 or fragments thereof. These data indicate that: (i) the Aβ42-promoting effects of mutant PS2 proteins reach the maximum level with a given single amino acid substitution (i.e. N141I or M239V); and (ii) the expression of full-length mutant PS2 is required for the overproduction of Aβ42.

Recent findings that the secretion of Aβ from primary neurons cultured from brains of mice that lack PS1 is decreased, despite the normal level of full-length β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) or the amyloidogenic COOH-terminal fragment thereof, argue for the notion that PS is an important co-factor for the proteolytic processing of βAPP at the COOH terminus of Aβ termed γ-cleavage (22De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms whereby mutant PS proteins affect γ-cleavage and lead to the increased production of Aβ42 is unknown. Some investigators have shown the direct association of PS and βAPP in cultured cells (23Weidemann A. Paliga K. Durrwang U. Czech C. Evin G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,24Xia W. Zhang J. Perez R. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, one may speculate a direct or indirect “chaperone”-like effect of mutant PS or effects on intracellular vesicular trafficking to increase the susceptibility of βAPP to be cleaved at position 42. Several questions arise from these observations. The mechanistic effects of a given single amino acid substitution in mutant PS protein leading to AD are not yet understood. Previous data showing that either of the two known PS2 mutations, i.e. the Volga German mutation that substitutes Asn-141 for Ile (N141I) or the Italian mutation causing a Met-239 to Val (M239V) mutation, considerably increase the percentage of secreted Aβ42 (17Citron M.

To gain insights into the nature of pathogenic effects caused by PS2 mutations, we first examined whether a mutant PS2 molecule harboring both the N141I and M239V mutations would increase the overproduction of Aβ42, compared with singly mutated PS2 with one or the other of these mutations. PS1 and PS2 have been shown to undergo endoproteolytic cleavage that yields a long NH2-terminal fragment (NTF) and a short COOH-terminal fragment (CTF) spanning the membrane 6 and 2 times, respectively (18Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Haass C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between cleavage and function of PS is not well understood. Next we sought to examine if the NTF or CTF forms of mutant PS2 alone are capable of promoting the secretion of Aβ42. To this end, we expressed partially truncated forms of PS2 (eliminating the COOH-terminal third of PS2 while retaining the endoproteolytic NTF) harboring a N141I mutation, as well as CTFs of PS2 in cultured cells and examined the COOH-terminal properties of Aβ secreted from these cells. A full-length cDNA encoding wild-type (WT) human PS2 was obtained by PCR from a normal human cDNA library, and the N141I or M239V PS2 mutations were introduced by the dU-template method as described previously (18Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Haass C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2025-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). WT as well as mutant (mt) PS2 cDNAs were subcloned into pBluescript, and the coding region was then subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. The N141I/M239V double mutation was introduced by digesting the N141I mt PS2 cDNA in pBluescript withBamHI and BstXI and then inserting the resultant ∼0.5-kilobase pair product between theBamHI-BstXI sites of M239V mt PS2 in pcDNA3. cDNAs encoding COOH-terminally truncated WT or N141I mt PS2 (i.e. PS2/270stop, PS2/303stop, and PS2/388stop) were generated by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), and the following oligonucleotides were used as PCR primers: 5′-CCGGGATCCAGACCTCTCTGCGGCCCCAAGT-3′ as a sense primer, 5′-CATTCTCTCGAGCTATTTGGGACACAG-3′ for PS2/270stop, 5′-AGCTCGAGCTAGCCAACCGTCCACAC-3′ for PS2/303stop, and 5′-GGCTCGAGCTACGTGGTATTCCAGTC-3′ for PS2/388stop as antisense primers, respectively. These primers were incubated with WT or N141I mt PS2 cDNAs in pcDNA3, and the PCR products were digested withBamHI and XhoI. Purified fragments were ligated into pcDNA3. cDNAs encoding varying lengths of PS2 COOH-terminal fragments (i.e. PS2/270ctf, PS2/304ctf, and PS2/344ctf) were similarly generated by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GGCACTCGAGTGTAAAACTATACAACTGC-3′ as an antisense primer and 5′-CCGGATCCACCATGGGGCCTCTGAGA-3′ for PS2/270ctf, 5′-CCGGATCCACCATGGCGAAGCTGGAC-3′ for PS2/304ctf, and 5′-ACGGATCCATGAGTTTTGGGGAGCCT-3′ for PS2/344ctf as sense primers. These primers were incubated with WT PS2 cDNA in pcDNA3, digested, and ligated into pcDNA3. Schematic depictions of truncated and/or mutated PS2 derivatives are shown in Fig. 1. To express derivative polypeptides of PS2 fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST), cDNAs encoding the NH2-terminal (2–84) or the loop (301–361) portions of PS2 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into an Escherichia coliexpression vector (pGEX-6P-1, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These ligations resulted in the fusion of PS2 sequences COOH-terminal and in-frame with GST. All constructs were sequenced using Thermosequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on an automated sequencer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) as described (18Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K.

Transient expression in COS-1 cells was performed by the DEAE-dextran method, and stable N2a cell lines were generated by transfecting the cDNAs in pcDNA3 vector using a mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene) or LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and selection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 400 or 500 μg/ml. Double transfection of COS-1 cells with cDNAs encoding PS2 or its derivatives in pcDNA3 and those encoding the COOH-terminal 100 amino acids (C100) of βAPP in p91023(E) was performed as described previously (18Tomita T.

Thinakaran. The locations of immunogen peptides/protein fragments within PS2 are shown in Fig. 1. Cells were lysed in 2% SDS sample buffer and briefly sonicated. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE without prior heating, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with each of the anti-PS antibodies as described (18Tomita T.

Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were cultured on glass coverslips. Cells were fixed by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, permeabilized, and blocked with PBS-TB (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then incubated with primary antibodies against PS2 for 2 h and fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies in PBS-TB for 1 h, mounted in PermaFlour Aqueous Mounting Medium (IMMUNON), and viewed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview, Olympus, Tokyo) as described (30Baba M.

Two-site ELISAs that specifically detect the COOH terminus of Aβ were used. BNT77 raised against human Aβ11–28, which recognizes full-length as well as NH2-terminally truncated Aβ, was used as a capture antibody; BNT77 binds human as well as rodent-type Aβ but does not react with the 3-kDa fragment (p3) beginning at the Leu-17 residue of Aβ. BA27 and BC05, monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize the COOH termini of Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively, were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and used as detector antibodies. The specificity and sensitivity of these ELISAs have been characterized previously (18Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Haass C.

Culture media were collected after appropriate incubation periods (60 h in COS-1 and 12 or 24 h in N2a cells) and subjected to BNT77/BA27 or BC05 ELISAs as described (18Tomita T. Maruyama K.

We transfected cDNAs encoding WT or N141I, M239V single mt as well as N141I/M239V double mt PS2 cDNAs transiently into COS-1 cells or stably into N2a cells and analyzed the cell lysates by Western blots using anti-PS2 antibodies. As we have previously observed (18Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Haass C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pettingell W.H. Jung Y.K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) because its generation was inhibited by a caspase-3 inhibitor, DEVD-CHO. 2T. Tomita and T. Iwatsubo, unpublished observation. In addition, a small amount of a ∼23-kDa CTF was detected. In N2a cells, 50–55-kDa fl PS2 (Fig. 2,arrow), 35-kDa NTF (Fig. 2,closed arrowhead), as well as a 23-kDa CTF (Fig. 2,open arrowhead) were detected. However, the amounts or ratios of NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments were similar in M239V or N141I/M239V double mt PS2 compared with N141I mt or WT PS2 both in COS-1 and N2a cells (Fig. 2).Figure 2Expression and metabolism of PS2 in N2a cells stably transfected with single or double mutant PS2 genes.

Cell lysates (20 μg of protein) from N2a cells transfected with an empty pcDNA3 vector or with wild-type, N141I mt, M239V mt, or N141I/M239V double mt PS2 cDNAs were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-G2N2 or anti-PS2loop antibodies.

The percentages of Aβ42 secreted from COS-1 cells doubly transfected with βAPP C100 and N141I or M239V mt PS2 were elevated to almost similar levels (∼30%) by 2.2-fold compared with those from cells with WT PS2 and βAPP C100 (average of Aβ42, 13.8%), and the absolute levels of secreted Aβ42 were increased by 2.3 (N141I) and 1.7 (M239V) times, respectively, compared with WT PS2. When COS-1 cells were transfected with N141I/M239V double mutated PS2 and βAPP C100, the Aβ42 was 31.4%, and the Aβ42 level also was similar to those in cells with singly mutated PS2 (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained in COS-1 cells doubly transfected with full-length WT or Swedish-type mutant (i.e. 595/596 KM-NL) βAPP together with mt PS2 (data not shown). We then examined the secretion of Aβ from stably transfected N2a cell lines expressing WT, N141I, M239V, or N141I/M239V mt PS2. As described previously (18Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S. Capell A. Walter J. Grünberg J. Haass C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2025-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), N2a cells expressing N141I mt PS2 secreted considerably increased amounts or percentages of Aβ42 (71.6% of total Aβ and 4.2 times compared with those with WT PS2: 17.0%). N2a cells expressing M239V mt PS2 also secreted significantly increased levels (3.4 times compared with those with WT PS2) or percentage (mean, 58.3%) of Aβ42. However, the secretion of Aβ42 from cells expressing N141I/M239V double mutant PS2 were again similar to those with either of the single PS2 mutations in terms of the absolute levels (4.1 times compared with those with WT PS2) or percentages (mean, 59.3%) (Fig. 3 B). The expression of endogenous βAPP was at similar levels between different N2a cell lines (data not shown). To gain insights into the biological significance of endoproteolytic processing of PS2 and especially to examine whether the NTF or CTF of PS2 is biologically active, we then expressed truncated forms of WT or N141I mt PS2 in cultured cells and characterized their metabolism and subcellular localization. Two categories of cDNAs encoding truncated PS2 were used (see Fig. 1): (i) NTF constructs (WT or N141I mt) ending at residues 270, 303, or 388 (designated PS2/270stop, PS2/303stop, and PS2/388stop), retaining the NH2-terminal 6 (or 7) transmembrane (TM) domains and shorter than, close to, or longer than the predicted size of PS2 NTF, respectively (33Podlisny M.B.

PS2/344ctf is close to the size of the “ALG-3” fragment, which was found to inhibit cellular apoptosis (35Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Cros"

Previous work has demonstrated SREBP-mediated transcriptional activation of genes encoding enzymes of sterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. Because synthesis of both sterols and C18 fatty acids are required for cell growth, in the absence of exogenous supplements of these lipids, we examined the hypothesis that fatty acid can also be regulatory in SREBP maturation. Our data indicate that C18 fatty acids can potentiate the biological activities of a typical, regulatory sterol: 25-hydroxycholesterol. Inhibition of C18 fatty acid synthesis in cells cultured in serum-free medium renders them resistant to killing by 25-hydroxycholesterol. Repression of expression of reporter constructs driven by promoters bearing SRE-1 element(s) by 25-hydroxycholesterol is increased by C18 fatty acid supplementation. C18 fatty acids also increase the inhibitory effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol on proteolytic maturation and nuclear localization of SREBPs. Furthermore, we also show that C18 fatty acid supplementation can enhance the inhibitory effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol on sterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. These results demonstrate that maximal down-regulation of SREBP maturation and the consequent repression of SRE-1 promoters occurs in response to both a regulatory sterol and fatty acid.

Oxygenated sterols, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol, are down-regulators of cholesterol biosynthesis (1Kandutsch A.A. Chen H.W. Heininger H.J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3027) Google Scholar) of transcription factors called SREBPs, which are synthesized as proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. SREBP proteolysis to the soluble, mature transcription factors is inhibited by 25-hydroxycholesterol at the first cleavage. Genes that are transcriptionally activated by SREBPs possess specific recognition elements for these proteins, called SREs (2Rudney H. Panini S.R. Curr. Opin.

However, these observations create something of a metabolic paradox because they suggest that fatty acid biosynthesis can be inhibited by sterols, a regulatory mechanism that would lead to inhibition of cell growth when exogenous sources of sterols were high but fatty acids were poor. Somatic cell mutants of CHO cells, resistant to killing by 25-hydroxycholesterol in the absence of lipoprotein cholesterol, have been extremely useful in further defining the role of SREBPs in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis (10Leonard S. Sinensky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Chang T.Y. Hasan M.T. Chin J. Chang C.C.Y. Spillane D.M. Chen J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mutants characterized to date, fall into two classes (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3027) Google Scholar): class 1 mutants are sterol-resistant because they produce a truncated SREBP-2 that serves as a constitutive, mature transcription factor, and class 2 mutants are defective in a protein called SCAP (SREBP-cleavage activatingprotein), which appears to transduce the oxysterol-mediated inhibition of SREBP proteolysis. Class 2 mutants carry out the normally oxysterol-regulated first proteolytic cleavage constitutively. Many oxysterol-resistant mutants were isolated long before the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, particularly the role of the SREs and SREBPs, was understood. Early somatic cell genetic characterization indicated that there was genetic diversity in such mutants and that some were recessive (13Sinensky M. Armagast S. Mueller G. Torget R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6621-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Sinensky M. Logel J. Torget R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 113: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The class 1 and 2 mutants, whose defects are now known, are dominant (or co-dominant) mutations. Our laboratory reported (15Panini S.R. Lutz R.J. Wenger L. Miyake J. Leonard S. Andalibi A. Lusis A.J. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14118-14126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a novel, recessive 25-hydroxycholesterol-resistant mutant (crB). This mutant had a genetic defect in fatty acid elongation that was required for both resistance to killing and down-regulation of mRNA levels transcribed from cholesterol biosynthetic genes. Lack of regulation of the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, HMG-CoA reductase, as well as its mRNA, was observed. Supplementation of these cells with a mix of stearate and oleate restored cell growth to normal, but most of the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase by 25-hydroxycholesterol and partial restoration of cell growth could be produced by oleate supplementation alone. These results suggest a solution to the metabolic paradox outlined above, which is that oxysterols can lose activity as regulators of SRE promoters when cells are starved for C18 fatty acids, particularly oleate. In this report we further explore the molecular basis for these observations and test the hypothesis that oleate can modulate the transcriptional regulatory activity of 25-hydroxycholesterol. The crB mutant turned out to be difficult to analyze for such initial studies because, as will be described elsewhere, its genotype appears to be complex. Instead, we have made use of a potent inhibitor of fatty acid elongation, hexadecynoic acid, in the current study. IgG-2A4 and IgG-7D4 cells, which produce monoclonal antibodies SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, respectively, were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (catalog numbers CRL-2121 and CRL-2198). All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (FAF-BSA, catalog number A6003) was from Sigma. Stearate and oleate were obtained from NuChek Prep (Elysian, MN), and 25-hydroxycholesterol was from Steraloids Inc.

Lowenstein (Brandeis University, Waltham, MA). CHO-K1 cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (F12FC5) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Stably transfected cells were produced by co-transfecting cells with 2 μg of pWLneo and 20 μg of either pLDLRCAT-6500 or pTK-Kx3-CAT by the CaPO4 precipitation method using a mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The neomycin-resistant cells were selected using 600 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) in F12FC5. Resistant colonies were isolated and assayed for CAT activity as described below. Colonies possessing CAT activity were expanded and maintained in F12FC5 containing 300 μg/ml G418. For 25-hydroxycholesterol cytotoxicity assays, CHO-K1cells were seeded at a density of 5,000 cells/60-mm dish in F12FC5 on day 0. On day 1, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice and then fed either Nutridoma-SP (1% in Ham's F12) or Nutridoma-SP containing fatty acids and sterols as described in the figure legends. Following a 48-h incubation, the Nutridoma-SP was removed, and the cells were fed F12FC5 for 5 days. The surviving colonies were then fixed and stained with crystal violet as described (13Sinensky M. Armagast S. Mueller G. Torget R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6621-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For assay of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), cells were seeded in F12FC5 at 1.5 × 105cells/well in multiwell (35 mm) tissue culture plates (Falcon, catalog number 3846). Following a 16-h incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with PBS. The cells were then cultured for 16 h in F12 medium containing 5% twice-delipidized (15Panini S.R.

The cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and once with cold 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 (buffer K) (16Chang T.-Y. Limanek J.S. Chang C.C. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) before being incubated for 2 min in room temperature buffer K. The buffer K was aspirated, and cell lysate was collected by scraping the cells in 200 μl of buffer K. The cell lysate was adjusted to a concentration of 0.25m Tris by the addition of an appropriate amount of 2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. 75 μl of 4 mm acetyl Co-A in 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.5, was added to 50 μl of cell lysate, and the reactions were initiated with 25 μl of 600 μm chloramphenicol containing 2 μCi/ml [14C]chloramphenicol in 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.5. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 0.25 to 2 h before extraction of the chloramphenicol and reaction products with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. After dessication, the residue was resuspended in 50 μl of ethyl acetate and applied to LK5D silica TLC plates (Whatman). The plates were developed in chloroform/methanol (95:5). After drying, the TLC plates were subjected to autoradiography using Kodak XAR5 film. The amount of acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol produced was quantified by scintillation counting. On day 0, cells were seeded at 2 × 106/100-mm culture dish in F12FC5. On day 1, the medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with PBS. The cells were then incubated for 20 h in F12DIPE5 containing 50 μm compactin and 50 μm sodium mevalonate in the presence or absence of sterols and fatty acids as described in the legends. Nuclear extracts and 105 × g membrane fractions were prepared essentially as described by Hua et al. (17Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using a μBCA kit (Pierce). Samples of the nuclear extracts and membrane fractions were mixed with 2× SDS loading buffer (18Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% gels. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Milipore). The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) followed by a 1-h incubation with either protein A-purified IgG-7D4 or IgG-2A4 at 5 μg/ml in TBS-T. The blots were then rinsed five times with TBS-T and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:50,000 in TBS-T. The blots were rinsed five times with TBS-T, and ECL was performed using SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). CHO-K1 cells were seeded at 1 × 106/100-mm culture dish in F12FC5 for 16 h. The cells were rinsed with PBS twice and incubated for 24 h in F12DIPE5 supplemented with 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and 50 μm oleate-BSA as indicated. [3H]Acetate (10 μCi/ml) was added to each dish, and the incubation continued for another 24 h. Total cellular lipids were extracted with hexane:isopropyl alcohol (60:40) essentially as described previously (15Panini S.R. Lutz R.J. Wenger L. Miyake J. Leonard S. Andalibi A. Lusis A.J. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14118-14126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were saponified in 10% methanolic KOH at 65 °C for 1 h, and nonsaponifiable lipids were extracted into hexane. The aqueous phase was acidified with concentrated HCl, and the fatty acids were extracted into petroleum ether followed by diethyl ether. Pooled extracts were dried under N2, and the fatty acids were redissolved in hexane. Incorporation of [3H]acetate into nonsaponifiable lipids and fatty acids was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The protein concentration of each dish was determined by solublizing the lipid extracted cells with 0.1n NaOH and performing a BCA protein assay (Pierce) using BSA as standard. We have previously shown that CHO-K1 cells treated with HDA, an inhibitor of endogenous fatty acid elongation, synthesize very little stearate and no detectable oleate compared with untreated controls (15Panini S.R. Lutz R.J. Wenger L. Miyake J. Leonard S. Andalibi A. Lusis A.J. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14118-14126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also previously shown that a somatic cell mutant defective in elongation of palmitate is resistant to the cytotoxic effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol in lipid-free medium (15Panini S.R. Lutz R.J. Wenger L. Miyake J. Leonard S. Andalibi A. Lusis A.J. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14118-14126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Therefore, we reasoned that if C18 fatty acid synthesis was necessary for 25-hydroxycholesterol cytotoxicity, HDA treatment might render cells resistant to 25-hydroxycholesterol. Indeed, when CHO-K1 cells were incubated with HDA, the cytotoxicity of 25-hydroxycholesterol was diminished compared with cells not treated with HDA (Fig. 1). HDA supplementation by itself was without effect on the growth rate of the cells. These results confirm our prior observations that C18 fatty acid synthesis has a synergistic role in 25-hydroxycholesterol cytotoxicity. Because inhibition of C18 fatty acid synthesis with HDA renders CHO-K1 cells resistant to killing by 25-hydroxycholesterol in lipoprotein poor medium, it seemed plausible that HDA treatment might also produce resistance of genes containing SREs to down-regulation by 25-hydroxycholesterol, as well. This has been the general pattern observed with 25-hydroxycholesterol-resistant somatic cell mutants. To determine whether cellular C18 fatty acid levels affect sterol regulation, we examined the effects of HDA treatment and fatty acid supplementation on transcription. For this, we utilized an LDL receptor promoter construct, pLDLRCAT-6500, which contains the entire LDL receptor promoter and has been demonstrated to be regulated by sterols (19Sudhoff T.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10773-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When stably transfected into CHO-K1 cells, transcription of this construct is up-regulated when incubated in delipidized medium and down-regulated when the cells are treated with 25-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 2). Supplementation of the delipidized medium with fatty acids (stearate and oleate) complexed to FAF-BSA or with FAF-BSA alone had little or no effect on the expression of the reporter gene. However, when the delipidized medium was supplemented with 25-hydroxycholesterol and fatty acids, expression of the reporter gene was reduced by approximately 2-fold compared with cells incubated in the same medium without fatty acids (Fig. 2). On the other hand, treatment of CHO-K1 cells with HDA partially inhibited the down-regulation of the LDL receptor promoter by 25-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 2). HDA treatment caused a decrease in the down-regulation produced by 25-hydroxycholesterol from 7.2-fold to 2.5-fold. Furthermore, the effect of HDA on the response to 25-hydroxycholesterol could be nearly abolished by supplementing the delipidized medium with 10 μm stearate and oleate. Supplementation of HDA-treated cells with these fatty acids resulted in an ∼11-fold decrease in the amount of CAT activity upon addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol, which is similar to the amount of down-regulation produced by 25-hydroxycholesterol in the absence of HDA. Thus, inhibition of fatty acid chain elongation causes a diminuition in transcriptional regulation of the LDL receptor promoter by 25-hydroxycholesterol. We next examined whether the SRE-1 alone was sufficient to confer fatty acid augmentation of sterol down-regulation or if additional sequences outside of the SRE-1 were necessary for this effect. For this we utilized an artificial promoter construct, pTK-Kx3-CAT, which contains three tandemly repeated LDL receptor SRE-1 sequences within the thymidine kinase promoter and has been shown to be regulated by sterols (20Dawson P.A. Hofmann S.L. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Sudhoff T.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3372-3379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with pTK-Kx3-CAT showed a response to 25-hydroxycholesterol similar to that of cells transfected with the full-length LDL receptor promoter construct (Fig.3). The sterol-mediated down-regulation of CAT activity was further enhanced by C18 fatty acids. CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with a control construct lacking a SRE showed no down-regulation when incubated in delipidized medium supplemented with 25-hydroxycholesterol alone or C18 fatty acids and 25-hydroxycholesterol (data not shown; also see Ref. 20Dawson P.A.

These results indicate that the SRE-1 element is the region of the LDL receptor promoter that is responsible for the observed effect of C18 fatty acids on the down-regulation of transcription by 25-hydroxycholesterol. We also noted that most, if not all, of the effect of the fatty acids on enhancing the down-regulatory effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol on the LDL receptor promoter could be observed with oleate supplementation alone (Fig. 4).Figure 4Oleate is sufficient for increasing sterol regulation of the LDL receptor promoter in CHO-K1 cells. CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with pLDLRCAT-6500 were incubated for 16 h in F12DIPE5 supplemented with and without sterols and either 10 μm stearate, 10 μm oleate, or 10 μm stearate plus 10 μm oleate as described for the upper panel of Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because regulation of LDL receptor transcription by oxysterols via SRE-1 has been demonstrated to be mediated by SREBPs, it seemed plausible that fatty acid supplementation would enhance the lowering of nuclear SREBP levels produced by 25-hydroxycholesterol. To test this hypothesis, nuclear extracts were prepared from CHO-K1 cells incubated in delipidized media supplemented with or without fatty acids in the presence or absence of oxysterols. Aliquots of nuclear extract were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibodies to SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. As expected, the nuclei of cells cultured in the absence of sterols contained the mature form of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, whereas the nuclei of cells incubated in medium supplemented with sterols contained significantly less of the mature form of either SREBP (Fig. 5). Supplementation with fatty acids alone did not obviously alter the nuclear levels of the mature SREBP-1 or BP-2. Consistent with the results from the reporter constructs, incubation of CHO-K1 cells with C18 fatty acids significantly enhanced the activity of 25-hydroxycholesterol in lowering the levels of SREBP-1 and BP-2 found in nuclear extracts. Because the major reported mechanism regulating nuclear SREBP levels is through sterol-mediated inhibition of their proteolytic maturation, these data are consistent with C18 fatty acids or a metabolite thereof, having a co-regulatory role in the proteolytic processing of SREBPs in response to sterols. We found that the effects of fatty acid supplementation on proteolytic processing of SREBPs was most readily demonstrated in cultures in which fatty acid elongation had been inhibited with HDA, where the proteolytic processing is expected to be very efficient. The results of such an experiment (Fig.6), confirms that C18 fatty acid supplementation enhances the activity of 25-hydroxycholesterol in lowering nuclear SREBP levels. Furthermore, the large decrease in the nuclear levels of the mature SREBPs in cells treated with the combination of fatty acids and 25-hydroxycholesterol is accounted for by a large increase in the accumulation of SREBP precursors in the membrane fractions. This result is consistent with a co-regulatory effect of fatty acid supplementation and 25-hydroxycholesterol on SREBP proteolytic maturation. Examination of stearate and oleate for specificity of regulation of nuclear SREBP levels indicates that the regulatory response is specific for oleate (Fig.7).Figure 6C18 fatty acids enhance sterol inhibition of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 proteolytic maturation. Nuclear and membrane proteins were isolated from CHO-K1 cells cultured for 24 h in F12DIPE5 containing 20 μm HDA and supplemented with and without sterols and C18 fatty acids as described for Fig. 5. 100-μg samples of membrane proteins (upper panels) and 50-μg samples of nuclear proteins (lower panels) were analyzed by immunoblotting as described in the legend to Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Oleate supplementation potentiates the reduction of nuclear SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 levels in response to sterols.

Differential regulation, presumably based on differential activity of residual mature SREBP in fatty acid starved cells, would permit fatty acid synthesis to proceed under conditions where exogenous sources of sterol, but not fatty acids, were present in sufficient quantity to permit cell growth. When both lipids are present, it would be expected that both pathways would be significantly down-regulated. To test these hypotheses, we examined the effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol treatment on incorporation of labeled acetate into sterols (as nonsaponifiable lipid) and fatty acids (as saponifiable lipid) in CHO-K1 cells in the presence or absence of exogenous oleate. The results (Table I) indicate that treatment with 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol, a condition that partially suppresses SREBP processing (Fig. 5) and suppresses transcription from the LDL receptor promoter approximately 5-fold (Fig. 2), inhibits sterol synthesis approximately 3-fold, whereas fatty acid synthesis is inhibited only 15%. Oleate supplementation enhances the inhibition of both sterol and fatty acid synthesis by 25-hydroxycholesterol.Table IIncorporation of [3 H]acetate into lipids of CHO-K1Lipid classControl25OHOleate25OH + Oleatedpm/h/mg proteinNonsaponifiable lipids120826 ± 98334619 ± 129493273 ± 510511740 ± 647Fatty acids120866 ± 213583612 ± 589958721 ± 645232746 ± 1866Cells were seeded at 1 × 106/100-mm culture dish and incubated in F12FC5 for 24 h.

Following a 24-h incubation, the incorporation into cellular lipids was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the average of triplicate determination ± S.D. Because fatty acids are precursors to membrane phospholipids, they constitute, along with cholesterol, the major structural constituents of the plasma membrane. It is therefore plausible that the biosynthetic pathways for these membrane components should be coordinately regulated. Several studies have appeared (4Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) demonstrating that sterols can be regulatory for fatty acid synthesis through transcriptional control mediated by SREBP-1. A role for SREBP-1 in whole animal fatty biosynthesis is also consistent with reduction in fatty acid synthesis in liver of SREBP-1 knockout mice (21Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). These studies are good evidence for coordination of the cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways by sterols. The opposite side of the cross-talk between fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol synthesis would be regulation of cholesterologenesis by fatty acids. Some suggestion that this can occur was indicated in a prior study from our laboratory (15Panini S.R. Lutz R.J. Wenger L. Miyake J. Leonard S. Andalibi A. Lusis A.J. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14118-14126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of a somatic cell mutant blocked in elongation of palmitate to stearate, which was defective in down-regulation of mRNAs encoding enzymes of sterol biosynthesis. We found that this mutant required both stearate and oleate for optimal growth, suggesting that cells could be sensitive to supplementation with both fatty acids. In the course of these studies, we also found that the regulatory responses to fatty acids could only be observed in a basal medium that is scrupulously free of C18 fatty acids. The organic solvent delipidized serum supplements or serum-free medium described above must be used to see these effects. Many of the previously published studies on regulation of SREBP processing by oxysterols have been performed in a basal medium with a lipopoprotein-deficient serum supplement (see, for example, Ref. 17Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Such medium still contains large amounts of fatty acids bound to serum albumin, which would mask the fatty acid component of the response of SREBP processing or LDL receptor promoter regulation to oxysterol treatment that we describe in the current report. In the current study, we demonstrate that oxysterol inhibition of proteolytic cleavage of SREBPs 1 and 2 is enhanced by fatty acid supplementation. As expected, this co-regulation of SREBP processing by 25-hydroxycholesterol and fatty acids also manifests itself as co-regulation of SRE-1 driven transcription, sterol synthesis, and even 25-hydroxycholesterol cytoxicity. Consistent with such co-regulation, inhibition of endogenous fatty acid elongation with hexadecynoate has the opposite effect of fatty acid supplementation on transcriptional repression by 25-hydroxycholesterol. The results with the individual fatty acid supplements (Fig. 4), indicate that most, if not all, of the co-regulatory effect on transcription is mediated by oleate. This observation is consistent with a comparison of the effects of stearate and oleate on SREBP processing (Fig. 7). We have also previously noted that oleate supplementation can restore most of the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase by 25-hydroxycholesterol in the crB mutant (15Panini S.R. Lutz R.J. Wenger L. Miyake J. Leonard S. Andalibi A. Lusis A.J. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14118-14126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this restoration of regulation did not occur either with saturated fatty acids (palmitate or stearate) or with polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleate or arachidonate). Co-regulation of SREBP processing by sterol plus oleate is mechanistically plausible in the light of our understanding of the transcriptional control of the synthesis of these two lipids by SREBPs. A class of regulatory somatic cell mutants, exemplified by M19, is defective in the second, oxysterol-insensitive, proteolytic step of SREBP maturation (22Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Significantly, these mutants, which cannot form mature SREBPs, are auxotropic for both cholesterol and oleate (23Limanek J.S. Chin J. Chang T.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5452-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Chin J. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6304-6310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is because of the role of SREBPs in transcriptional activation, not only of genes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, but also the gene that encodes the enzyme that converts stearate to oleate: stearoyl-CoA desaturase (9Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). A CHO-K1 mutant defective in stearoyl-CoA desaturase is an oleate auxotroph (25Chang T.-Y. Vagelos P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), demonstrating that expression of this enzyme is required for oleate synthesis and cell growth in the absence of exogenous oleate. Interestingly, the growth requirements for the mutants defective in SREBP maturation, like M19, does not include stearate, despite the reported regulation of saturated fatty acid synthesis by SREBPs, as well (4Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It therefore would appear that cholesterol and oleate constitute the two main metabolic products required for cell growth whose biosynthesis is regulated by SREBPs. We hypothesize that this dual requirement for these SREBP-regulated metabolites is responsible for presence of feedback regulation of SREBP maturation by both of these lipid metabolic end products. This mechanism ensures that synthesis of oleate will proceed in the presence of exogenous sterol, which in the absence of such bivalent control could down-regulate oleate synthesis producing a cellular growth arrest. We have demonstrated such a sparing effect on fatty acid synthesis in response to 25-hydroxycholesterol treatment in Table I. Interestingly, we also observe a statistically significant difference in the extents of inhibition of fatty acid and sterol synthesis (t test: 0.02 < p < 0.01) in response to oleate treatment. This observation is consistent with a specific feedback regulation of fatty acid synthesis, by fatty acids, in addition to the oxysterol/SREBP-mediated regulation. It has also been suggested that regulation of fatty acid synthesis in whole animals by ADD1/SREBP1, particularly in adipose tissue, is mediated primarily by insulin (8Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). It is entirely possible that a metabolite of oleate rather than oleate itself is the second regulator. One possibility is the intracellular form of cholesteryl ester, which is cholesterol oleate (27Goldstein J.L. Dana S.E. Faust J.R. Beaudet A.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8487-8495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it does not seem likely that this compound is the regulator because acyl CoA:cholesteryl acyl transferase inhibitors have been reported to enhance rather than inhibit down-regulation of LDL receptors (28Tabas I. Weiland D.A. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3147-3155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels (28Tabas I. Weiland D.A. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3147-3155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tam S.P. Ramharack R. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 95: 137-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) by exogenous sterol. There are, of course, numerous other possibilities. For example, after activation of oleate to oleyl CoA, an important possible next step in its metabolism is incorporation into the 2 position of lysophosphatidate to form phosphatidic acid. This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme, monoacylglycerol phosphate acyltransferase, which is found on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (30Brindley D.N. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 171-203Google Scholar). This is the same localization as SCAP, which is believed to be involved in sensing cellular sterols (31Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20213-20221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) through its membrane attachment domain. Perhaps, the membrane attachment domain of SCAP can sense such acyl-lipids as well as sterols. The differential response of SREBP maturation to saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids is somewhat reminiscint of nutritional studies on the effect of oleate-enriched diets on serum cholesterol levels. Studies in both human subjects (32Grundy S.M. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and monkeys (26Rudel L.L. Haines J.L. Sawyer J.K. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1873-1882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate when oleate is the major source of dietary fat LDL, cholesterol levels are lowered and HDL cholesterol levels are raised. It has been observed (12Griffen M.E. Dimitriadis E. Lenehan K. Owens D. Collins P. Johnson A. Tomkin G.H. Q. J. Med. 1996; 89: 211-216Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that human subjects on oleate enriched-diets produce an oleate enriched LDL that is more active than control LDL in lowering endogenous cholesterol synthesis. It is intriguing to speculate that these physiological effects of dietary oleate might be correlated with its down-regulatory effects on SREBP processing and endogenous cholesterol synthesis."

The signal transduction pathways necessary for CD28-mediated costimulation are presently unknown. Engagement of CD28 leads to its tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent binding to Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing proteins including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K); however, the contribution of PI3K to CD28-dependent costimulation remains controversial. Here we show that CD28 is capable of binding the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of several proteins, including Grb2. The interaction between Grb2 and CD28 is mediated by the binding of Grb2-SH3 domains to the C-terminal diproline motif present in the cytoplasmic domain of CD28. While the affinity of the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 for CD28 is greater than that of the N-terminal SH3 domain, optimal binding requires both SH3 domains. Ligation of CD28, but not tyrosine-phosphorylation, is required for the SH3-mediated binding of Grb2 to CD28. We propose a model whereby the association of Grb2 with CD28 occurs via an inducible SH3-mediated interaction and leads to the recruitment of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins such as p52shc bound to the SH2 domain of Grb2. The inducible interaction of Grb2 to the C-terminal region of CD28 may form the basis for PI3K-independent signaling through CD28.

The identity of the signal transduction pathways that are required for CD28-mediated costimulation are presently unknown.The cytoplasmic domain of CD28 contains no recognized intrinsic enzymatic activity; however, CD28 has been reported to associate with signaling proteins following ligation. Phosphorylation of CD28 on tyrosine 173 within the motif YMNM present in the cytoplasmic domain provides a binding site for the SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of PI3K (17Pages F. Ragueneau M.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3392-3402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, conflicting results regarding the requirement for PI3K in CD28-dependent costimulation have been published. Mutant forms of CD28 that are unable to bind to PI3K demonstrate an absolute requirement for PI3K in mediating CD28 signals in mouse T cell hybridoma cell lines (17Pages F. Ragueneau M. Rottapel R. Truneh A. Nunes J. Imbert J. Olive D. Nature. 1994; 369: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Further, wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI3K, inhibits costimulation through CD28 in human peripheral T cells (21Lahesmaa R. Allsup A. Soderberg C. Jackman J. Findell P. Peltz G. J.

In contrast to these studies, CD28 can provide costimulatory signals in the absence of PI3K activation in Jurkat cells and purified mouse T cells (23Crooks M.E.C. Littman D.R. Carter R.H. Fearon D.T.

Moreover, activation of PI3K by ectopically expressed CD19, a potent activator of PI3K in B cells, in conjunction with TCR ligation is insufficient to induce IL-2 transcription in Jurkat cells (23Crooks M.E.C. Littman D.R. Carter R.H. Fearon D.T. Weiss A. Stein P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6820-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that PI3K activation is neither necessary nor sufficient for CD28-mediated costimulation in certain cellular systems and suggest that alternative signaling pathways are involved in costimulation. In support of this view, deletion of 10 amino acids in the C-terminal portion of CD28, remote from the PI3K binding site, attenuates costimulation (26Truitt K.E. Nagel T. Suen L.F. Imboden J.B. J.

Until now, no signaling proteins that bind to this site have been identified.More recently, Grb2 has been implicated in CD28 signaling (28Cai Y.C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Nabavi N. Rudd C.E.

Grb2 is a linker protein that utilizes both SH2- and SH3- dependent interactions to bind to a diverse repertoire of signaling proteins. The canonical function of Grb2 is to stabilize an intermolecular complex between receptor tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptor, Met, and Flt3, and the positive regulator of the Ras pathway, Sos. Grb2 binds constitutively to Sos through its SH3 domains and inducibly binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors via its SH2 domain (30Buday L. Downward J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4549-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In TCR-stimulated cells, there is a rapid formation of a complex between Sos/Grb2 and a 36-kDa membrane protein, LAT, that is a substrate for the TCR-induced tyrosine kinases (38Buday L. Egan S.E. Rodriguez Viciana P. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell.

Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Grb2 has been shown to bind to CD28 following ligation of CD28 (28Cai Y.C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Nabavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Schneider H. Cai Y.-C. Prasad K.V.S. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, the Grb2-CD28 association was in part mediated by the Grb2-SH2 domain binding to the CD28 PI3K binding site, Tyr173 (28Cai Y.C. Cefai D. Schneider H. Raab M. Nabavi N. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Schneider H. Cai Y.-C. Prasad K.V.S. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J.

Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The SH3 domains of Grb2 also bind the product of the protooncogene c-cbl in T cells; however, the role of this interaction during T cell activation is not known (42Donovan J.A. Wange R.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26369-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).CD28 contains two potential SH3-binding diproline motifs, one of which is contained in part by the C-terminal region required for costimulation. SH3 domains bind to short peptide sequences rich in proline residues, which adopt a left-handed type II polyproline helix conformation. Two proline residues are presented as a bidentate hydrophobic contact surface that binds to a shallow hydrophobic groove common to SH3 domains (46Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that in addition to binding SH2-containing signaling molecules, CD28 is an SH3-binding protein. Following ligation, CD28 binds to the SH3 domains of Grb2 and Itk as well as to the WW domain of YAP.The association between Grb2 and CD28 occurs via an SH3-proline interaction involving the diproline motif embedded in the C-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic domain of CD28. The interaction between CD28 and Grb2-SH3 domains is phosphotyrosine-independent and does not require a functional SH2 domain. The SH3-mediated interaction between CD28 and Grb2 allows the SH2 domain of Grb2 to bind to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins such as p52shc . We propose a model in which Grb2 functions in a heretofore uncharacterized manner to couple CD28 to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins involved in CD28-mediated costimulation.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that CD28 is a binding target for a limited number of SH3-containing proteins. The isolated SH3 domains from Itk and Grb2 as well as the WW domain of YAP coprecipitated CD28 from cellular lysates. We have recently shown that the association of Itk with CD28 through the Itk-SH3 domain and the N-terminal diproline motif of CD28 results in the partial activation of the Itk kinase (60Marengere L.E. Okkenhaug K. Clavreul A. Couez D. Gibson S. Mills G.B. Mak T.W. Rottapel R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3220-3229PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have presented data that demonstrate that Grb2 forms an inducible complex with CD28 via its SH3 domains binding to the C-terminal diproline motif of CD28. The preferred binding sites of Itk and Grb2 are therefore distinct and correspond to the two respective diproline motifs present in the cytoplasmic domain of CD28. Binding of Grb2 to CD28 does not require tyrosine phosphorylation; nor does tyrosine phosphorylation preclude Grb2-SH3-mediated interactions with CD28. We have shown that the nonphosphorylated CD28 cytoplasmic domain expressed as a recombinant fusion protein in prokaryotic cells bound Grb2 from cellular lysates in an SH3-specific manner and was independent of the Grb2-SH2 domain. Tyrosine 173 in the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 is imbedded in a motif that has been shown to be the common binding site for both the Grb2 and the C-terminal p85-SH2 domains, although the C-terminal p85-SH2 domain binds to this site with 100-fold greater affinity than does the Grb2-SH2 domain (29Schneider H. Cai Y.-C. Prasad K.V.S. Shoelson S.E. Rudd C.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We observed that when GST-CD28 was quantitatively phosphorylated, the isolated Grb2-SH2 domain could bind to CD28 presumably through this site. However, even under these conditions the SH2 domain was not required for binding as evidenced by the capacity of Grb3–3, an isoform of Grb2 lacking a functional SH2 domain, to bind to both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of CD28. Furthermore, we observed that mAb-mediated ligation of CD28 that was insufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation necessary for p85 binding was nonetheless sufficient to induce Grb2 binding. These data suggest that Grb2 can bind to CD28 in two distinct configurations depending on the degree of receptor clustering and the state of CD28-tyrosine phosphorylation. Initial receptor aggregation induces a CD28-Grb2 complex, which is mediated by proline-SH3 interactions. Under conditions where tyrosine 173 is phosphorylated, a second Grb2 binding site that requires the SH2 domain is created. However, CD28 can generate signals to induce IL-2 transcription in the absence of P85-SH2 association to tyrosine 173 (13Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23Crooks M.E.C. Littman D.R. Carter R.H. Fearon D.T. Weiss A. Stein P.H. Mol. Cell.

It is therefore of considerable interest to identify other regions of the CD28 cytoplasmic domain involved in protein interactions. We have demonstrated that CD28 utilizes proline-rich motifs to recruit SH3-containing proteins, providing an alternate mechanism for the initiation of signaling through CD28.The Inducibility of Grb2-SH3 Binding to CD28 Correlates with Decreased Binding of Grb2 to CblThe factors that regulate the inducible interaction between Grb2 and CD28 described in this paper are presently unknown. SH3-diproline interactions are generally considered to be constitutive. For example, cytosolic Grb2 is bound to Sos in a preformed heteromeric complex (61Olivier J.P. Raabe T. Henkemeyer M. Dickson B. Mbamalu G. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Hafen E. Pawson T. Cell. 1993; 73: 179-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The interaction of Grb2 with Sos can be modulated, however, since serine/threonine phosphorylation of Sos diminishes Grb2 binding (62Corbalan-Garcia S. Yang S. Degenhardt K.R. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas engagement of the Grb2-SH2 domain by a phosphopeptide can enhance the association between Grb2 and Sos (63Ravichandran K.S. Lorenz U. Shoelson S.E. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 593-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The enhanced binding of CD28 to SH3-containing proteins such as Grb2 following ligation of the receptor could be a result of phosphorylation, allosteric changes in the cytoplasmic domain, or the release of another protein that blocks the interaction between CD28 and Grb2. We observed that tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-CD28 did not enhance the binding of Grb3–3 to the cytoplasmic tail of CD28, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation does not alter this association. Threonine phosphorylation of CD28 following phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment (64Hutchcroft J.E. Tsai B. Bierer B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13362-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) also did not affect the binding of Grb2 to CD28 (data not shown). There is currently no evidence for a constitutive interaction between CD28 and another molecule that could block the binding of CD28 to Grb2. We therefore support the possibility that an allosteric modification of the intracellular domain of CD28 exposes the diproline motif to SH3 domains following ligation of the receptor.We provide evidence that CD28 ligation results in the redistribution of Grb2 within intracellular protein pools. The inducible interaction between Grb2 and CD28 corresponds to a concomitant decline in the amount of Cbl coimmunoprecipitated with Grb2. Cbl has previously been shown to bind to Grb2 through SH3-dependent interaction (43Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S. Panchamoorthy G. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19141-19150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that CD28 and Cbl compete for limited access to SH3 domains of Grb2 and that these two proteins bind Grb2 in a mutually exclusive manner. Cbl functions as a suppressor of FcεRI signaling (65Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and may regulate the anergic state in T cells (66Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). One positive effector function of CD28 may be to alter the amount of Grb2 present in the Cbl protein complex.In a manner similar to the interaction of Grb2 with CD28, Grb2 has recently been reported to form a complex with the transmembrane receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase α via the Grb2 C-terminal SH3 domain and an 18-amino acid stretch localized close to the catalytic cleft of the N-terminal protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain (67den H.J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In vitro binding experiments indicated that the binding of Grb2 to receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase α and Sos/dynamin are mutually exclusive, reminiscent of our findings regarding the interaction of Grb2 with CD28 and Cbl.Potential SH2 Binding Targets of the CD28-associated Grb2The structural requirements for CD28-mediated costimulation are controversial. In some cellular systems, mutation of the PI3K binding site at 173 abrogates CD28-dependent IL-2 production, while in other systems it does not. The cytoplasmic tail of CD28 contains four conserved tyrosine residues, which, when all are mutated to phenylalanine (ALL F mutant), impairs signaling. Reconstitution of PI3K binding by a single add-back mutation at Tyr173 in the ALL F mutant is insufficient to reconstitute costimulation (26Truitt K.E. Nagel T. Suen L.F. Imboden J.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4539-4541PubMed Google Scholar). Add-back of tyrosine 191 within the motif PY191APPR that mediates binding of the SH3 domains of Grb2 to CD28 is sufficient to completely reconstitute CD28-dependent IL-2 production. Furthermore, deletion of the C-terminal 10 or 17 amino acids of CD28, which disrupts or deletes this diproline motif, profoundly impairs IL-2 production, whereas a seven-amino acid deletion, which leaves this motif intact, leads to enhanced costimulation (26Truitt K.E. Nagel T. Suen L.F. Imboden J.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4539-4541PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pages F. Ragueneau M. Klasen S. Battifora M. Couez D. Sweet R. Truneh A. Ward S.G. Olive D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9403-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This region has more recently been shown to be required for the CD28-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the GTPase-activating protein-associated p62 protein (p62DOK ) (68Klasen S. Pages F. Peyron J.-F. Cantrell D.A. Olive D. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that a 10-amino acid C-terminal truncation mutant of CD28 no longer binds to Grb2 (Fig. 3 D). Thus, a limited peptide sequence, which includes the proposed Grb2-SH3 binding site, is required for costimulation.We have shown that the unphosphorylated form of bacterially expressed CD28 can bind to both Grb2 and to the phosphorylated form of Shc derived from activated T cell lysates. We propose that CD28-bound Grb2 links phosphorylated Shc to the CD28 cytoplasmic domain. The role of Shc remains elusive in T cell receptor signaling. Grb2-Sos binds to phosphorylated Shc at tyrosine 317 and thereby stimulates Ras activation in response to growth factor stimulation (69Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W.

Cross-linking of TCR and CD4 was observed to induce phosphorylation of both the 48- and 52-kDa isoforms of Shc (57Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Burn P. Burakoff S.J. Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Grb2 has been detected in the phosphorylated Shc complexes in T cells. Shc has also been observed to bind to phosphorylated ζ-chain of the TCR complex (57Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Burn P. Burakoff S.J. Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), while others have shown that this interaction is relatively inefficient (71Osman N. Lucas S.C. Turner H. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13981-13986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently, phosphopeptide mapping has identified a second site of Shc phosphorylation involving two adjacent tyrosines at positions 239 and 240 (72van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis shows that these sites are not required for Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in response to IL-3 but rather may couple to pathways that regulate c-myctranscription (73Gotoh N. Toyoda M. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The Grb2-Shc complex may therefore link CD28 to the induction of c-myc message or to other phosphoproteins through the SH2 and PTB domains of Shc.Creation of the Signaling Patch: Recruitment of CD28 into the TCR-CD3 ComplexThe Grb2-SH2 domain can bind to the doubly phosphorylated ζ-immunereceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, although this interaction is of lower affinity than that between Zap-70 and the ζ-chain (71Osman N.

No Sos was detected in ζ-immunereceptor tyrosine-based activation motif precipitates, suggesting that the stoichiometry of this interaction is low or that Grb2 may be bound to a protein distinct from Sos (71Osman N.

https://openalex.org/W1979520752,"Many integral membrane proteins contain leucine-based motifs within their cytoplasmic domains that mediate internalization and intracellular sorting. Two types of leucine-based motifs have been identified. One type is dependent on phosphorylation, whereas the other type, which includes an acidic amino acid, is constitutively active. In this study, we have investigated how the spacing relative to the plasma membrane affects the function of both types of leucine-based motifs. For phosphorylation-dependent leucine-based motifs, a minimal spacing of 7 residues between the plasma membrane and the phospho-acceptor was required for phosphorylation and thereby activation of the motifs. For constitutively active leucine-based motifs, a minimal spacing of 6 residues between the plasma membrane and the acidic residue was required for optimal activity of the motifs. In addition, we found that the acidic residue of leucine-based motifs must be located amino-terminal to the dileucine sequence for proper function of the motifs and that residues surrounding the motifs affect the activity of the motifs. Thus, our observations suggest that the position, the exact sequence, and surrounding residues are major determinants of the function of leucine-based receptor sorting motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2019030530,"We recently identified SH2-Bβ as a JAK2-binding protein and substrate involved in the signaling of receptors for growth hormone and interferon-γ. In this work, we report that SH2-Bβ also functions as a signaling molecule for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). SH2-Bβ fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) bound PDGF receptor (PDGFR) from PDGF-treated but not control cells. GST fusion protein containing only the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ also bound PDGFR from PDGF-treated cells.

The N-terminal truncated SH2-Bβ containing the entire SH2 domain interacted directly with tyrosyl-phosphorylated PDGFR from PDGF-treated cells but not unphosphorylated PDGFR from control cells in a Far Western assay. These results suggest that the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ is necessary and sufficient to mediate the interaction between SH2-Bβ and PDGFR. PDGF stimulated coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous SH2-Bβ with endogenous PDGFR in both 3T3-F442A and NIH3T3 cells. PDGF stimulated the rapid and transient phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ on tyrosines and most likely on serines and/or threonines.

Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptors for GH and interferon-γ are members of the cytokine receptor family and are known to bind JAK tyrosine kinases (JAK2 for GH and both JAK1 and JAK2 for interferon-γ). After GH binding, JAK2 is activated and tyrosyl-phosphorylates its associated GH receptor as well as JAK2 itself (2Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). As a consequence of JAK2 autophosphorylation, SH2-Bβ is recruited into receptor/JAK2 complexes at least in part via the direct interaction of the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ with phosphotyrosine containing motif(s) in JAK2 (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GH promotes not only the association of SH2-Bβ with tyrosyl-phosphorylated JAK2, but also the tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SH2-Bβ also appears to be phosphorylated on serine(s) and/or threonine(s), even in the absence of ligand stimulation (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggested that SH2-Bβ, which contains multiple potential sites for protein-protein interaction in addition to its SH2 domain (9 tyrosines, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and multiple proline-rich motifs) (Fig. 1 A), serves as an adapter protein and recruits additional signaling molecules into cytokine receptor-JAK2 complexes (1Rui L.

In support of SH2-Bβ serving as a signaling molecule for receptor tyrosine kinase(s), SH2-Bβ was found to interact with receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (1Rui L. Mathews L.S.

In this work, we demonstrate that PDGF stimulates association of SH2-Bβ with PDGF receptor (PDGFR), and phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ. We also show that SH2-Bβ associates, not via the PDGFR, with a tyrosyl-phosphorylated, 84-kDa protein. These results provide strong evidence that SH2-Bβ is a previously unknown signaling molecule for PDGF. The stock of 3T3-F442A fibroblasts was kindly provided by H.

Anti-JAK2 antiserum (αJAK2) was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 758–776 of murine JAK2 (9Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B. Quelle F.W. Cleveland J.L. Yi T.

Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (αPY) and polyclonal antibody against human PDGF receptor (αPDGFR, recognizing both α and β subunits) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and used at a dilution of 1:7500 and 1:1000 for immunoblotting, respectively. αPDGFR was used at a dilution of 1:100 for immunoprecipitation. 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were treated for 10 min with 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB, vehicle, or other ligands as indicated. For GST fusion protein pull-down assays, whole cell lysates were precipitated with GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and subsequently immunoblotted with αPDGFR or αPY as described previously (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins containing SH2-Bβ or mutant SH2-Bβ were prepared as described previously (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arg within the FLVRQS motif in the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ was mutated to Glu using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant SH2-Bβ (SH2-Bβ(R-E)) was subcloned into pGEX-KG to generate a GST fusion protein. For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibody on ice for 2 h. The immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose (50 μl) during a 1-h incubation at 4 °C. In some experiments, αSH2-B immunoprecipitates were dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase or PP2A as described previously (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibody. Some membranes were stripped by incubation at 55 °C for 30–60 min in stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and reprobed with a different antibody. For Far Western blotting, PDGFR was immunoprecipitated with αPDGFR from solubilized 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose was incubated with GST-SH2-Bβc (1.5 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing, the membrane was immunoblotted with αSH2-B. The blot was stripped and reprobed with αPDGFR and αPY sequentially. To determine whether SH2-Bβ serves as a signaling molecule for PDGF, we first tested whether SH2-Bβ binds to PDGFR. 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, which express endogenous PDGFR (10Campbell G.S. Christian L.J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7427-7434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were deprived of serum overnight and treated with 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB or vehicle for 10 min. Cell lysates were incubated with immobilized GST or GST fusion protein containing full-length SH2-Bβ, N-terminally truncated SH2-Bβ (SH2-Bβc), or the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ (Fig.1 A), and immunoblotted with αPDGFR. GST-SH2-Bβ bound to PDGFR in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2). GST-SH2-Bβc (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4) and GST-SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ (Fig. 1 B,lanes 5 and 6) also bound PDGFR from PDGF- but not vehicle-treated cells. Reprobing with αPY showed that PDGFR that is associated with SH2-Bβ or truncated SH2-Bβ is tyrosyl-phosphorylated (data not shown). In contrast, GST alone did not bind PDGFR (Fig. 1 B, lane 7). These results suggest that SH2-Bβ interacts with activated, tyrosyl-phosphorylated PDGFR, and that the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ may mediate the interaction between SH2-Bβ and PDGFR. To investigate whether SH2-Bβ binds PDGFR directly or indirectly through some intermediate molecule, the ability of GST-SH2-Bβc to bind PDGFR was determined by Far Western blotting. 3T3-F442A cells were treated with 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB or vehicle. PDGFR was immunoprecipitated with αPDGFR, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose was incubated first with GST-SH2-Bβc, and then with αSH2-B. GST-SH2-Bβc bound directly to PDGFR from PDGF-treated (Fig.2 A, lane 2) but not vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 2 A,lane 1), although an equal amount of PDGFR was present (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). Reprobing the same blot with αPY confirmed the PDGF-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of PDGFR (Fig.2 A, lanes 5 and 6). These results indicate that SH2-Bβc binds directly to tyrosyl-phosphorylated, activated PDGFR. To demonstrate the crucial role of the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ in mediating the interaction of SH2-Bβ with PDGFR, we examined the ability of PDGFR to bind to GST fusion protein containing a mutant SH2-Bβ in which Glu replaced the Arg (amino acid 555) within the FLVRQS motif in the SH2 domain. This positively charged Arg within the highly conserved FLVRQS motif in SH2 domains has been shown to interact with the negatively charged phosphate on the phosphotyrosine of its binding partner (11Waksman G.

Kay L.E. Forman-Kay J.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Mutation of this critical Arg has been shown to abolish the binding ability of the SH2 domain to its corresponding phosphotyrosine motif for several molecules (14Mayer B.J. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 15Zhu G. Decker S.J. Mayer B.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1775-1779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion protein containing this mutant SH2-Bβ ((GST-SH2-Bβ(R-E)) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with cell lysates of either 3T3-F442A or NIH3T3 cells. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with αPY. GST-SH2-Bβ bound to tyrosyl-phosphorylated PDGFR from PDGF-treated NIH3T3 cells (Fig.2 B, lane 5) as well as 3T3-F442A cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), indicating that the interaction of SH2-Bβ with PDGFR is not cell-type-specific. Mutation of Arg to Glu within the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ inhibited binding of SH2-Bβ to tyrosyl-phosphorylated PDGFR from either 3T3-F442A (Fig.2 B, lane 3) or NIH3T3 (Fig. 2 B,lane 6) cells. These results suggest that the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ mediates the interaction between SH2-Bβ and PDGFR. To examine whether endogenous SH2-Bβ associates with endogenous PDGFR in mammalian cells, 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, shown previously to express endogenous SH2-Bβ (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were treated with PDGF-BB or vehicle. Solubilized proteins were immunoprecipitated with αSH2-B and immunoblotted with αPDGFR. SH2-Bβ was observed to coimmunoprecipitate with PDGFR in PDGF-stimulated (Fig.3, lane 2) but not control cells (Fig. 3, lane 1), consistent with the findings (shown in Figs. 1 B and 2) that SH2-Bβ binds only to tyrosyl-phosphorylated, activated PDGFR. Pre-immune serum was unable to precipitate PDGFR from PDGF-treated cells (Fig. 3, lanes 3and 6). Reprobing the same blot with αPY confirmed that PDGFR associated with SH2-Bβ is tyrosyl-phosphorylated (Fig. 3,lane 5). Similarly, SH2-Bβ was detected in αPDGFR immunoprecipitates only when cells were stimulated with PDGF (data not shown). SH2-Bβ also coimmunoprecipitated with PDGFR in NIH3T3 cells in response to PDGF-BB (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8), further demonstrating that the association of SH2-Bβ with PDGFR is not cell-type-specific. Taken together, the results of Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3suggest that PDGF stimulates the recruitment of SH2-Bβ to PDGFR presumably via a direct interaction of the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ with phosphotyrosine-containing motif(s) in the activated PDGFR. SH2-Bβ was previously shown to be tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to GH and interferon-γ (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether PDGF is able to stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ, 3T3-F442A cells were treated with PDGF-BB, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αSH2-B and immunoblotted with αPY. PDGF-BB stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ (Fig. 4, upper panel; Fig. 5 B,lane 4; Fig. 6,lane 4; Fig. 7,lane 3). Based upon the migration of proteins immunoblotted with αSH2-B (Fig. 4, lower panel; Fig. 5 B, lane 9; Fig. 7,lane 8), SH2-Bβ migrates as a diffuse band indicated by the bracket. For reasons discussed below, the tight band, designated p84 in Figs. 4, 5 B, 6, and7, is believed to be a tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein that coimmunoprecipitates with SH2-Bβ, and not a form of SH2-Bβ. As predicted from Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, tyrosyl-phosphorylated PDGFR coimmunoprecipitated with SH2-Bβ from PDGF-BB-treated cells (Fig. 4,lanes 2–7, upper panel; Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and 5; Fig. 6, lane 4; Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 3) but not from control (Fig. 4, lane 1; Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–3; Fig. 6, lane 3; Fig. 7, lane 1) or GH- or EGF-treated cells (Fig. 7,lanes 4 and 5). When the blots were reprobed with αSH2-B, PDGF-BB was observed to cause a significant upward shift in the mobility of SH2-Bβ (Fig. 4, lower panel; Fig.5 A, lane 2; Fig. 5 B, lane 9; Fig. 7, lane 8), consistent with SH2-Bβ being phosphorylated in response to PDGF. The PDGF-BB-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation and shift in mobility of SH2-Bβ were rapid (within 1 min), transient (Fig. 4), and dose-dependent (data not shown), indicating that phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ is a tightly regulated process. Interestingly, the greatest shift in SH2-Bβ mobility was observed after 5 min of 25 ng/ml PDGF (Fig. 4, lower panel), while the tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ was not maximal until 15 min (Fig. 4, upper panel). Similarly, the mobility shift of SH2-Bβ was the greatest at a dose of 5 ng/ml for 15 min, but the tyrosyl phosphorylation was not maximal until 25 ng/ml (data not shown). Because the multiple SH2-Bβ bands in control and GH-treated 3T3-F442A cells have been shown to be differentially phosphorylated forms of SH2-Bβ, this discrepancy between mobility shift and αPY signal suggests that in addition to stimulating tyrosyl phosphorylation, PDGF-BB also promotes the phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ on serine(s) and/or threonine(s). Curiously, the degree of tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ measured using αPY Western blotting is less than that of the PDGFR, which coimmunoprecipitates with SH2-Bβ (Figs. 4 and 5 B). Although the reason for the lower signal is not known, it may reflect: 1) fewer phosphorylated tyrosines in SH2-Bβ compared with PDGFR (reported to be phosphorylated on at least 10 tyrosines (5Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ruusala A. Sundberg C. Arvidsson A.K. Rupp-Thuresson E. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J.

As discussed above, PDGF-BB treatment decreased the migration of SH2-Bβ (Fig. 5 A,lane 2). Alkaline phosphatase treatment reduced the multiple forms of SH2-Bβ observed in PDGF-BB-treated cells (Fig.5 A, lane 2) to a faster migrating form (Fig.5 A, lane 3). Simultaneously, the intensity of the faster migrating form of SH2-Bβ increased significantly (Fig.5 A, lane 3), indicating a shift of SH2-Bβ from slower to faster migrating forms. Sodium vanadate significantly reduced the effect of alkaline phosphatase on the PDGF-BB-induced mobility shift of SH2-Bβ (Fig. 5 A, lane 4), indicating that the change of migration of SH2-Bβ by alkaline phosphatase is due to dephosphorylation. To provide evidence for the multiple bands in the presence of PDGF being due at least in part to serine and/or threonine phosphorylation, cell lysates from PDGF-BB-treated 3T3-F442A cells were incubated with αSH2-B. αSH2-B immunoprecipitates were treated with PP2A (a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase) and immunoblotted with αPY (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–5) and subsequently with αSH2-B (Fig. 5 B, lanes 6–12). Consistent with our previous report (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PP2A treatment of proteins from control cells reduced the multiple forms of SH2-Bβ to a single faster migrating form (Fig. 5 B, lanes 6–8). Interestingly, in PDGF-BB-stimulated cells, PP2A treatment reduced the broad, diffuse bands of SH2-Bβ (Fig. 5 B, lane 9) to two distinct, faster migrating protein bands (Fig. 5 B,lanes 10 and 11). This condensation of bands is consistent with SH2-Bβ being phosphorylated on multiple serines/threonines in the presence of PDGF. The two bands observed with PP2A treatment aligned exactly with the two major tyrosyl-phosphorylated SH2-Bβ bands observed in the corresponding αPY blot (Fig. 5 B, lane 5), suggesting that PDGF stimulates the phosphorylation of at least 2 tyrosines within SH2-Bβ. Okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of PP2A, completely abrogated the effect of PP2A on the PDGF-induced mobility shift of SH2-Bβ (Fig. 5 B, lane 12). Although PP2A increased substantially the migration of tyrosyl-phosphorylated SH2-Bβ (Fig. 5 B, lane 5), it did not affect the degree of tyrosyl phosphorylation of either SH2-Bβ or SH2-Bβ-associated PDGFR (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and5), indicating that it is specific for serines/threonines as expected. A tight, tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein band designated p84 coimmunoprecipitated with SH2-Bβ (Figs. 4,5 B, 6, and 7). Interestingly, p84 aligns with neither of the two forms of SH2-Bβ after dephosphorylation by PP2A (Fig.5 B, lanes 5, 10, and 11), suggesting that p84 is an SH2-Bβ-interacting protein and not a form of SH2-Bβ itself. PDGF stimulation increased the amount of tyrosyl-phosphorylated p84 associated with SH2-Bβ (Fig. 4,upper panel; Fig. 6, lane 4). p84 does not appear to associate with SH2-Bβ via PDGFR because αPDGFR did not immunoprecipitate p84 (Fig. 6, lane 2). Furthermore, when αSH2-B immunoprecipitates were first dissociated by boiling in SDS-containing buffer, and then re-immunoprecipitated with αSH2-B, p84, like PDGFR, did not coimmunoprecipitate with SH2-Bβ (Fig. 6,lane 5). These data indicate that αSH2-B does not cross-react with either PDGFR or p84, and that both PDGFR and p84 associate with SH2-Bβ in cells stimulated with PDGF. In addition to PDGFR, SH2-Bβ, and p84, multiple other tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins were present in αSH2-B immunoprecipitates when cells were treated with PDGF-BB (Fig. 4, lanes 2–6, upper panel; Fig. 6, lane 4). Because tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins of similar size are also precipitated by αPDGFR and PDGFR coimmunoprecipitates with SH2-Bβ, it is not clear whether these other phosphoproteins associate with SH2-Bβ directly or indirectly through their interaction with SH2-Bβ-bound PDGFR. It is also unclear whether PDGF stimulates the association of p84 and/or these other phosphoproteins with SH2-Bβ or SH2-Bβ constitutively associates with these proteins and PDGF stimulates their tyrosyl phosphorylation. As PDGF-BB is able to activate both α and β subunits of PDGFR, it is not clear which subunits in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts recruit and phosphorylate SH2-Bβ in response to PDGF-BB. To begin to dissect which subunit of PDGFR utilizes SH2-Bβ, 3T3-F442A cells were treated with PDGF-AA (which activates only the α subunit of PDGFR; Ref. 17Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and solubilized proteins were immunoprecipitated with αSH2-B and immunoblotted with αPY. The extent of ligand-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ and the multiple other proteins including PDGFR that coimmunoprecipitate with SH2-Bβ was similar between cells stimulated with PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 3), with PDGF-AA being a little less effective than PDGF-BB at the same dosage. PDGF-AA, like PDGF-BB, caused a decrease in SH2-Bβ mobility (Fig. 7, lanes 7 and 8). These data suggest that the α subunit of PDGFR recruits SH2-Bβ as a signaling protein in 3T3-F442A cells. Whether SH2-Bβ also associates with PDGFRβ remains to be determined. To investigate whether other receptor tyrosine kinases regulate SH2-Bβ, 3T3-F442A cells, which are also responsive to EGF (10Campbell G.S. Christian L.J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7427-7434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 10 min, and αSH2-B immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with αPY. A tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein of a size appropriate for EGF receptor coimmunoprecipitated with SH2-Bβ from EGF-treated (Fig. 7, lane 5) but not control (Fig. 7, lane 1) cells, suggesting that SH2-Bβ is present in a complex with EGF receptor. Surprisingly, tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ was not detectable using αPY (Fig. 7, lane 5), although a significantly reduced migration rate of SH2-Bβ was observed in EGF-treated cells (Fig. 7, lane 10). Similarly, EGF stimulated a large shift in mobility of SH2-B in PC12 cells without detectable tyrosyl phosphorylation (data not shown). Incubation of αSH2-B immunoprecipitates with alkaline phosphatase completely abolished the EGF-induced mobility shift (data not shown). These data suggest that the EGF-induced mobility shift is most likely due to phosphorylation, and that the phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ elicited by EGF occurs mainly on serines and/or threonines. The proposal that EGF, as well as PDGF-BB, stimulates phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ on serines/threonines is further suggested by the finding that EGF and PDGF-BB stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ to a much lesser extent than GH (Fig. 7, lanes 3–5) but cause a greater (PDGF-BB) or similar (EGF) shift in mobility of SH2-Bβ (Fig.7, lanes 8–10). In the current study, we show that SH2-Bβ binds directly to tyrosyl-phosphorylated, but not unphosphorylated, PDGFR in both GST fusion protein pull-down and Far Western blotting assays. The SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ is sufficient for binding to PDGFR in the GST fusion protein pull-down assay. Furthermore, when the conserved Arg was mutated to Glu within the FLVRQS motif in the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ, the ability of mutant SH2-Bβ to bind PDGFR was dramatically inhibited. These results suggest that the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ is both necessary and sufficient for binding to tyrosyl-phosphorylated, activated PDGFR. The ligand-dependent interaction of SH2-Bβ with PDGFR was further confirmed by the coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous SH2-Bβ with endogenous PDGFR in both 3T3-F442A and NIH3T3 cells. The finding that there is an upward shift in mobility of SH2-Bβ upon PDGF-BB treatment that is abolished by alkaline phosphatase provides clear evidence that PDGF promotes phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ. Similarly, blotting with αPY provides strong evidence that PDGF promotes tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ. The fact that PP2A condenses the broad SH2-Bβ band to two faster migrating bands suggests that at least two tyrosines are phosphorylated. Because SH2-Bβ binds directly to activated PDGFR, it is logical to hypothesize that SH2-Bβ is phosphorylated directly by PDGFR. In support of this, when coexpressed in COS cells, SH2-Bβ is tyrosyl-phosphorylated by PDGFR β subunit. 2L. Rui, A. Kazlauskas, and C. Carter-Su, unpublished data. The fact that PP2A increases the migration of SH2-Bβ in control and PDGF-treated cells suggests that SH2-Bβ is phosphorylated on serines and/or threonines. In support of PDGF and/or EGF stimulating the serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ, there is a discrepancy between changes in SH2-Bβ mobility and amount of αPY binding to SH2-Bβ. A maximal decrease in mobility of SH2-Bβ occurs at shorter times and at lower PDGF-BB concentrations than the maximal increase in tyrosyl phosphorylation as detected by αPY. In the extreme case of EGF, no signal is detectable by αPY but a significant decrease in SH2-Bβ mobility is observed. In addition, PDGF-BB stimulates a greater decrease in SH2-Bβ mobility than GH, but is much less effective than GH at stimulating tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ. Although we favor the hypothesis that PDGF and EGF stimulate the serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ, our data do not exclude the possibility that SH2-Bβ is constitutively phosphorylated on serines/threonines and that EGF, PDGF, and GH stimulate the phosphorylation of different tyrosines on SH2-Bβ. However, one would have to hypothesize that those tyrosines phosphorylated by EGF receptor are not recognized by the αPY used in this study, that those phosphorylated by PDGFR include some that are recognized by αPY and some that are not, and that those phosphorylated in response to GH bind αPY with high affinity. It would not be surprising for SH2-Bβ to be phosphorylated on multiple serines/threonines because sequence analysis reveals that SH2-Bβ has 82 serines and 26 threonines, including multiple potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and a potential site (PLSP) for mitogen-activated protein kinases (e.g. ERK1/2). Protein kinase Cs and/or ERKs are potential candidates for PDGF-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ, because PDGF is reported to activate multiple isoforms of protein kinase C (18Li W.

We observed a tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein withMr ∼ 84,000 (p84) coimmunoprecipitating with SH2-Bβ in PDGF-stimulated cells. When the αSH2-B immunocomplex was dissociated by boiling in SDS-containing buffer, p84 was no longer immunoprecipitated by αSH2-B, suggesting that αSH2-B interacts with p84 indirectly through SH2-Bβ rather than directly binding to p84. p84 does not coimmunoprecipitate with PDGFR, suggesting that the interaction of SH2-Bβ with p84 is not mediated by PDGFR. The identity of p84 is not known. It is unlikely that p84 is the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase because p84 is not recognized by anti-p85 in immunoblots (data not shown). Interestingly, when αSH2-B raised from a different rabbit (rabbit 2) was used to immunoprecipitate SH2-Bβ, another tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein withMr ∼ 145,000 (p145) was observed in αSH2-B immunoprecipitates only from PDGF-stimulated cells (data not shown). We therefore believe that SH2-Bβ interacts with multiple proteins besides PDGFR, as expected for an adapter protein involved in PDGFR signaling. SH2-Bβ thereby may actively regulate PDGFR signaling by initiating some as yet unidentified pathways. PDGF-induced phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ may play a significant role in PDGFR signaling. The phosphorylated tyrosines in SH2-Bβ may form docking sites for other signaling molecules which contain SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains, which may include p84 and p145 as discussed above. The significance of serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ is unclear. Phosphoserine(s)/threonines in SH2-Bβ could serve as a binding site for other signaling molecules such as 14-3-3 (24Ichimura T. Uchiyama J. Kunihiro O. Ito M. Horigome T. Omata S. Shinkai F. Kaji H.

Two isoforms of SH2-B, designated SH2-Bα and SH2-Bβ, have been described to date (1Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Osborne M.A. Dalton S. Kochan J.P. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). SH2-B, along with Lnk and APS, are proposed to form a new adapter family (35Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Masuhara M. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lnk, with an SH2 domain 68% identical to SH2-B, is expressed preferentially in lymphoid tissues and has been shown to bind to phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, Grb2, and phospholipase Cγ (36Huang X. Li Y. Tanaka K. Moore K.G. Hayashi J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11618-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). APS, with a PH domain 58% identical to that of SH2-B and an SH2 domain 80% identical to that of SH2-B, was cloned as a binding protein for the kinase domain of c-Kit receptor and is predicted to play a role in B cell antigen receptor activation (35Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Masuhara M. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ, which is highly conserved among SH2-Bβ, Lnk and APS, mediates the interaction between SH2-Bβ and PDGFR, we predict that Lnk, APS, SH2-Bα, or their homologues also bind to activated PDGFR and serve as signaling molecules for PDGFR in those cells that express both PDGFR and the SH2-B-related proteins. In summary, we have shown that in response to PDGF, SH2-Bβ is recruited onto PDGFR complexes via direct interaction with PDGFR, and is tyrosyl-phosphorylated. SH2-Bβ is also phosphorylated on serines/threonines. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ appears to be increased by PDGF and EGF stimulation. The SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ is required and sufficient for the interaction of SH2-Bβ with tyrosyl-phosphorylated PDGFR. As a consequence of association of SH2-Bβ with PDGFR, signaling molecules bound to SH2-Bβ such as p84 are also recruited by PDGFR. We conclude that SH2-Bβ is a previously unknown signaling molecule for PDGF signaling. It will be interesting to determine whether SH2-Bβ mediates some of the actions of PDGF that cannot be accounted for by previously identified PDGF signaling molecules. We thank M. R. Stofega and Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2028336700,"A closely related family of enzymes fromMycobacterium tuberculosis has been shown by heterologous expression to catalyze the modification of mycolic acids through the addition of a methyl (or methylene) group derived fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). Overproduction of all six of these enzymes in Escherichia coli and subsequent in vitro reactions with heat-inactivated acceptor fractions derived from Mycobacterium smegmatis in the presence of [methyl-3H]SAM demonstrated that the immediate substrate to which methyl group addition occurs was a family of very long-chain fatty acids. Inhibitors of methyl transfer, such as S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and sinefungin, were shown to inhibit this reaction but had no effect on whole cells of either M. smegmatis or M. tuberculosis. Purified mycolic acids from M. tuberculosis were pyrolyzed, and the resulting meroaldehyde was oxidized and methylated to produce full-length methyl meromycolates. These esters were shown to comigrate with a fraction of the acceptor from the in vitro reactions, suggesting that methyl group addition occurs up to the level of the meromycolate. Protease and other treatments destroyed the activity of the acceptor fraction, which was also found to be extremely sensitive to basic pH. Antibody to the acyl carrier protein AcpM, which has recently been shown to be the carrier of full-length meromycolate produced by a unique type II fatty acid synthase system, inhibited the cell-free methyl(en)ation of these acids. These results suggest that mycolate modification reactions occur parallel with the synthesis of the AcpM-bound meromycolate chain.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis replicates within the hostile environment of the mammalian macrophage whose microbicidal products are generally insufficient to kill this highly resistant bacillus. This intrinsic resistance to antibacterial substances is due, in large part, to the impermeable nature of the mycobacterial cell wall (1Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 2Liu J. Barry III, C.E. Nikaido H. Ratledge C. Dale J.W. Mycobacteria: Molecular Biology and Virulence.

The mycobacterial cell wall consists of three covalently attached polymers: the peptidoglycan, the arabinogalactan, and the mycolic acids. The very low fluidity of the hydrophobic domain of this structure significantly reduces the rate at which hydrophobic substances are taken in and thereby potentiates the toxicity of such substances. This low fluidity is directly attributable to the structure of the mycolic acids, which comprise a large proportion of the cell wall mass (4Liu J. Barry III, C.E. Besra G.S. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29545-29551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Because of the essential nature of this structure to the intracellular life of M. tuberculosis, its biosynthesis and assembly offer critical potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. Mycolic acids are α-alkyl-β-hydroxy fatty acids of exceptional length and complexity, which range up to 80 carbons in total chain length and include various functional groups such as cis ortrans cyclopropanes or olefins, α-methyl methyl ethers, or α-methyl ketones. Because of their structural complexity and issues of overlap with enzymes responsible for synthesizing short-chain fatty acids, in vitro systems for studying their biosynthesis have been difficult to develop. We have identified a family of six homologous enzymes by heterologous expression in the saprophytic mycobacterial species Mycobacterium smegmatis that are involved in generating structural diversity among these molecules by the apparent addition of a methyl group fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) 1The abbreviations used are: SAMS-adenosyl-l-methioninePCRpolymerase chain reactionHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyFAB-MSfast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy.1The abbreviations used are: SAMS-adenosyl-l-methioninePCRpolymerase chain reactionHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyFAB-MSfast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy.

The mechanism of methylation by these enzymes has been proposed to involve the formation of an intermediate carbocation, which can then react to form a variety of different chemical structures depending upon the active site configuration of the particular enzyme resulting in the observed structural diversity of mycolic acids.

Although heterologous expression studies have proven useful for identifying the genes encoding the enzymes involved in mycolic acid modification, they have not resolved critical issues regarding the substrate for methyl(ene) group transfer, including lipid chain length during SAM addition and the head group or acyl carrier moiety during methyl addition. Previous reports of radiomethyl group addition from SAM to very long-chain (∼48–56 carbons) mycolate precursors by cell-free supernatants of M. tuberculosis H37Ra suggested that development of a cell-free system based upon combining recombinant enzyme produced in Escherichia coli with soluble acceptor fractions from various mycobacterial species would prove successful (9Qureshi N. Sathyamoorthy N. Takayama K. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 46-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently demonstrated that the long meromycolic acid chain is synthesized on an acyl carrier protein designated AcpM by a novel type II fatty acid synthase system (10Mdluli K.

To understand the biosynthetic details of meromycolate modification and the relationship of this system to the AcpM-utilizing type II fatty acid synthase system, we developed cell-free systems for studying the transfer of a methyl group by the meromycolate methyl transferase enzyme family.

Jacobs, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York) and the various recombinants were grown at 37 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 medium with albumin/dextrose/catalase supplement (ADC) containing, where appropriated, kanamycin (25 μg/ml) (Sigma) or hygromycin 50 μg/ml) (Calbiochem). E. coli strain DH5α and JM109 (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used for routine DNA manipulations and grown in LB broth with, when appropriate, kanamycin or hygromycin (200 μg/ml) or ampicillin (Sigma) (50 μg/ml). The electroporation-competent cells of E. coli strain K38 (ATCC 35049) transformed with T7 DNA polymerase-containing plasmid pGP1–2 (11Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar) were prepared by growing at 30 °C in LB with kanamycin toA600 nm 0.4–0.6. After 1 h in ice, the 500-ml culture was centrifuged and washed twice by prechilled distilled water and once in 10% cold glycerol. Cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of 10% glycerol, and its aliquots were frozen in dry ice-ethanol and kept at −80 °C. In addition to the antisera cross-reacting with CMAS-1, MMAS-2, MMAS-3, and MMAS-4 (7Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), several monospecific affinity-purified antibodies were produced from rabbit serum against the following peptides: CMAS-1, QLVANSENLRSKRV; CMAS-2, YSSNAGWKVERYHRI; MMAS-1, RNHYERSKDRLAAC; MMAS-4, CAEKPISPTKTRTRFED; AcpM, CPDAVANVQARLEAESK (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA). PCR primers mma4.1 (5′-gcgcgccatATGACGAGAATGGCCGAGAAACCG) and mma4.2 (5′-ccgcgggctcttccgcaGGCCGCGGCACCCGGCTTGAGG) were used to amplify themma4 open reading frame (primer sequence shared bymma4 is shown in uppercase). These primers introduce anNdeI site at the start of the open reading frame and aSapI site after the last codon. The 929-base pair PCR product was cloned in pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). TheNdeI-SapI fragment was then removed from this plasmid and inserted into the same sites of pTYB1 (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) to create the expression plasmid pBGS25. TheE. coli strain ER2566 transformed with pBGS25 was grown at 37 °C in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an OD650 nm of 1.2, then induced with 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. The predicted molecular mass of the MMAS-4-intein-chitin binding domain fusion protein produced by pBGS25 is 92 kDa. The open reading frames of genes coding for the methyltransferases CMAS-1, CMAS-2, MMAS-1, MMAS-2, and MMAS-3 were amplified from the corresponding cosmids by PCR with Pwo DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) using the following pairs of primers:cma1, 5′-GCGGTACCATGCCCGACGAGCTGAAG-3′, 5′-GGAAGCTTGGTGTGCATTGGTAGTCA-3′; cma2,5′-AGAGAATTCATGCCGATGCAACGGTGG-3′, 5′-CGCAGGCTTTTATTTGACCAGAGTG-3′; mma1, 5′-AGAGGTACCATGGCCAAGCTGAGACC-3′, 5′-CGCGAATTCGAGCTACTTGGTCATGG-3′; mma2, 5′-AGAGGTACCATGCCTCGAGCATGCG-3′, 5′-CGCGAATTCCTACTTCGCCAGCGTG-3′; mma3, 5′-AGAGGTACCATGTCTGATAACTCAACG-3′, 5′-GCGGAATTCGTCTACTTGGCCAGCGTG-3′. The PCR products were digested with the proper restriction endonucleases (KpnI andHindIII for cma1, EcoRI andHindIII for cma2, KpnI andEcoRI for mmas) and ligated with pRSET-B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) also cut with those enzymes. After transformation in either DH5α or JM109, plasmids with correct inserts were selected and sequenced. They were then used to transform strain K38(pGP1–2) (11Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar) for expressions as His6 tag fusion proteins using thermal induction. For expression in M. smegmatis, pMH29-cma1, pMH29-cam2, pMV206-mma1, pMV206-mma2, pMV206-mma3, and pMV206-mma4 were constructed as described previously (6George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,7Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases, DNA-modifying enzymes, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Plasmids or DNA fragments were purified and isolated with Qiagen plasmid kit, QIAquick nucleotide removal kit, QIAquick PCR purification kit, or gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Crude cell lysates were prepared from 1 liter of M. smegmatis cells grown to an OD650 nm of 0.5–1.0. The cell pellets were washed with 100 ml of cold Buffer 1 (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The cells were resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer 1 and removed to a bead beater chamber with 10 g of glass beads (0.1 mm in diameter) (Biospec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK). The cells were lysed by beadbeating twice for 1 min with an intervening 3-min cooling on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged twice at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and then (where indicated) the lysate was heat-inactivated at 90 °C for 10 min. In most assays, the substrate-containing lysate was used on the same day. In some cases frozen heat-treated substrate was used. Activity from frozen substrate was comparable with that of fresh lysates over 1–2 weeks. Overproduction of recombinant methyltransferases in K38(pGP1-2) was induced by growing cells (1:40 dilution from an overnight grown culture) in 500 ml of LB broth at 30 °C to anA590 of 0.4. The culture was then incubated with shaking at 42 °C for 30 min followed by 37 °C for 90 min with shaking. E. coli cells were washed and lysed as described for mycobacterial cells. Equal volumes of substrate (mycobacterial supernatant) and enzyme (E. coli supernatant) were mixed in a glass vial and incubated with [3H]SAM (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO) (275 μCi of 72.4 Ci/mmol per 10-ml reaction) at 37 °C for 1 h. The lipids were saponified in 10% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide at 100 °C overnight. Methylation with iodomethane was as described previously (6George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The methyl esters were separated by an acetonitrile to dioxane gradient by C18 reverse phase HPLC, and radioactivity was monitored by a β-RAM inline scintillation detector (In/Us System Inc., Fairfield, NJ) (12Qureshi N. Takayama K. Schnoes H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 182-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Takayama K. Qureshi N. Jordi H.C. Schnoes H.K. Hawk G.L. Biological/Biomedical Applications of Liquid Chromatography. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1979: 375-394Google Scholar). Columns were calibrated using methyl esters prepared from commercially available saturated fatty acids (Aldrich). For the cell-free assays the following gradient was used: 0–2 min 100% acetonitrile; 2–52 min linear gradient to 100% dioxane, 52–62 min hold at 100% dioxane. The extended gradient shown in Fig. 7 was 0–2 min 75/25 acetonitrile/dioxane, 2–62 min linear gradient to 25/75 acetonitrile/dioxane, 62–65 min to 100% dioxane. In inhibition experiments, the substrates were incubated with 1 mg/mlS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (Sigma) or sinefungin (from Bill Baker, PathoGenesis Corp., Seattle, WA) (17Krembel J. Etamadi A.-H. Tetrahedron. 1966; 22: 1113-1119Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or rabbit anti-AcpM polyclonal antisera at 37 °C for 30 min before the addition of methyltransferase and [methyl-3H]SAM. Ammonium sulfate was added to 20% saturation to the mycobacterial lysate, and the precipitates were resuspended and dialyzed against distilled water at 4 °C overnight. The substrate was further purified by Resource Q anion exchange using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. The sensitivity of the substrates (or products) to proteinase treatment and alkaline conditions was tested by incubating the reaction solution with trypsin at 37 °C followed by the addition of an excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor or by dialysis against 0.01 n NaOH for 2 h, followed by Folch extraction (2:1 chloroform:methanol and aqueous partition) to produce an organic and an aqueous phase. The radioactivity of methylated lipids of each phase was measured by HPLC. A procedure described previously (10Mdluli K. Slayden R.A. Zhu Y. Ramaswamy S. Pan X. Mead D. Crane D.D. Musser J.M. Barry III, C.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) was modified and used to detect whether AcpM is the carrier of the substrate for methyltransferase. The aqueous phase from the cell-free reaction was lyophilized and then resuspended with 10:10:3 (chloroform:methanol:water). The soluble materials were loaded on a silica gel TLC plate that was developed with butanol:water:acetic acid (5:3:2). Pools of materials with different RF value were scraped from the plate and hydrolyzed with 20% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. The Km value of MMAS-2 was measured by the competitive inhibition of the incorporation of [methyl-3H]SAM with increasing concentrations of cold SAM. The corrected rates for the reactions were used to generate a Lineweaver-Burk plot for estimation of the kinetic constants (14Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985Google Scholar). Optimal reaction pH and the affect of pH on the distribution of radioactivity in organic and aqueous phases were determined by making the crude lysate in Buffer 1 with different pH values. For all of these quantitative assays, the peaks corresponding to all long-chain products were integrated and converted to total counts per 1-h reaction. Immunogold staining of ultrathin sections was performed with anti-CMAS1 sera as described previously (15Barry III, C.E. Hayes S.F. Hackstadt T. Science. 1992; 256: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosisstrain H37Rv was grown at 37 °C to an OD of 1.0 at 650 nm in 7H9 broth with Tween 80 and ADC. The organisms were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting cell pellet was suspended in an equal volume of 40% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and incubated at 100 °C overnight. The suspension was then cooled to room temperature, and an equal volume of 5% iodomethane in dichloromethane was added. This suspension was mixed on a rotator for 5 h at room temperature and then allowed to sit until phase separation was complete. The resulting upper phase was discarded. The lower organic phase was washed with an equal volume of water, then 0.1n hydrochloric acid, then water again and transferred to a 30-ml Corex centrifuge tube and dried under nitrogen at 70 °C. The resulting material was solubilized in 10 ml of toluene and 5 ml of acetonitrile, and the full-length mycolic acids were precipitated by the further addition of 10 ml of acetonitrile (16Hamid M.E. Minnikin D.E. Goodfellow M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 25-ml toluene/acetonitrile solution was chilled to −20 °C for 2 h and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was discarded, and the toluene/acetonitrile precipitation of the mycolic acids was repeated. The precipitated mycolic acids were then subjected to class separation by preparative silica gel TLC with a mobile phase of hexane:ethyl acetate (95:5). 1H NMR and mass spectral analysis of the isolated classes of mycolic acids were in accord with that reported previously (7Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The meroaldehyde of the various isolated classes was prepared largely as described previously (17Krembel J. Etamadi A.-H. Tetrahedron. 1966; 22: 1113-1119Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified methylmethoxy mycolic acid was placed in a reaction vessel under a vacuum of 26 inches of mercury and heated to 300 °C for 30 min. The resulting meroaldehyde was HPLC-purified on a Beckman ODS reversed phase column using an acetonitrile to dioxane gradient. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 0.33 (m, 1H), 0.57(m, 1H), 0.64(m, 2H), 0.84(d, 3H), 0.88(t, 3H), 1.25 (br s, >20H), 1.60(br s, 2H), 2.40(t, 2H), 2.93(br s, 1H), 3.30(s, 3H), 9.70(s, 1H). FAB-MS (+) (relative abundance, M + 89 (dioxane adduct)): 919 (35), 947 (100), 975 (65), 1003 (30Lopez-Marin L.M. Quemard A. Laneelle G. Lacave C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The purified meroaldehyde was oxidized by the addition of silver(II) nitrate in a solution of 10% sodium hydroxide, 2.5% tetrahydrofuran, 2.5% toluene, and 50% ethanol at room temperature for 1 h. The resulting solution was acidified with hydrochloric acid and extracted three times with diethyl ether. The ether extract was dried under nitrogen at 50 °C. The resulting material containing the mero acid was solubilized in dichloromethane and methyl-esterified as described previously (5Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The methyl meromethoxy mycolate was purified by reversed phase HPLC. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 0.33 (m, 1H), 0.57 (m, 1H), 0.64 (m, 2H), 0.84 (d, 3H), 0.88 (t, 3H), 1.25 (br s, >20H), 1.60 (br s, 2H), 2.30 (t, 2H), 2.93 (br s, 1H), 3.33 (s, 3H), 3.70 (s, 3H). The ester was then dried under nitrogen at 70 °C, hydrolyzed in a solution of 7.5% potassium hydroxide in 25% methanol at room temperature for 1 h. The solution was then acidified with hydrochloric acid and extracted with diethylether three times. The ether extract was dried and subjected to FAB-MS(−) (relative abundance): 816 (15Barry III, C.E. Hayes S.F. Hackstadt T. Science. 1992; 256: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), 844 (60), 872 (100), 900 (45). We had previously implicated six different enzymes involved in modification reactions of mycolic acids by heterologous expression in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. CMAS-1 introduces the distalcis-cyclopropane (5Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), CMAS-2 introduces the proximalcis-cyclopropane (6George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), MMAS-1 converts a cis- to atrans-olefin with the introduction of an allylic methyl branch (8Yuan Y. Crane D.C. Musser J.M. Sreevatsan S. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10041-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and MMAS-2, MMAS-3, and MMAS-4 together produce thecis-cyclopropyl methoxymycolic acids (7Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To assess the functions of these enzymes in vitro, we cloned each gene into one of two E. coli expression vectors, which included either a hexahistidine fusion (His6 tag) at the N terminus or a chitin-binding domain and intein-containing cleavage sequence at the C terminus (Fig. 1). Robust expression of each of these genes was evident with the production of a fusion protein of the appropriate molecular weight as shown. The identity of the fusion proteins of CMAS-1, MMAS-1, MMAS-2, MMAS-3, and MMAS-4 was confirmed by Western blotting using polyclonal antisera directed to affinity-purified peptide-elicited antisera to a CMAS-1 sequence common to several members of this family of enzymes (data not shown). Expression of cma1 containing an N-terminal His6 tag in M. smegmatis and analysis of the mycolic acids produced by this strain revealed the presence of the distally cyclopropanated, proximally α-methylatedtrans-olefinic mycolic acid characterized previously (5Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the presence of the fusion peptide did not adversely affect enzyme activity (data not shown). We also overproduced each of these enzymes in M. smegmatisusing an efficient expression system based on the plasmids pMH29 and pMV206 (6George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In M. smegmatis, overproduction of each enzyme was less robust, and the phenotype of isolated mycolic acids from these strains was as described previously. To evaluate various in vitro assay conditions, we first reproduced the transfer of tritium from [methyl-3H]SAM to long-chain fatty acids in lysates of M. tuberculosis, which had been previously reported by Takayama and co-workers (9Qureshi N. Sathyamoorthy N. Takayama K. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 46-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using similar conditions we then labeled clarified wild type M. smegmatis lysates and discovered that, following saponification and methyl ester formation, no long-chain components contained radiolabel. Instead, we observed by reversed phase radio-HPLC an intense peak centering at about 22 min (Fig. 2 A). Presumably this product corresponds to tuberculostearic acid, the product of methylation of oleic acid (18Ratledge C. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. 1. Academic Press Ltd., San Diego, CA1982: 53-93Google Scholar). This activity could be completely eliminated by heating the M. smegmatis extract to 90 °C for 10 min (Fig. 2 B). Soluble E. coli extracts containing any of the methyltransferase enzymes showed no specific labeling of lipid-containing materials (Fig. 2 C), but when combined with heat-treated (Fig. 2 D) or non-heat-treated (Fig. 2 E) lysates from M. smegmatis the recombinant proteins catalyzed the incorporation of a tritium label from SAM into very long-chain lipid components with HPLC retention times between 35 and 45 min. The temperature and duration of the heat treatment were critical to maintaining substrate activity; treatment of the M. smegmatis lysate at 100 °C for 20 min prior to addition of the recombinant methyltransferase completed eliminated activity (data not shown). Using heat-inactivated acceptor (90 °C for 10 min) from M. smegmatis and recombinant fusion proteins produced in E. coli, we were able to observe cell-free activity from CMAS-1, CMAS-2, MMAS-2, MMAS-4, and MMAS-3 + MMAS-4 (Fig.3, A–F). CMAS-1, CMAS-2, and MMAS-2 produced similar product distributions (Fig. 3,B–D), whereas MMAS-4 produced mycolate precursors that eluted substantially earlier by HPLC (Fig. 3 E). The elution characteristics of this product are consistent with the predicted introduction of a secondary hydroxy group, rendering the meromycolate more polar and faster eluting. Interestingly, the presence of the large intein-chitin binding domain C-terminal sequence did not affect the ability of this protein to perform its catalytic function. MMAS-1 alone did not result in incorporation of label (not shown), consistent with the lack of an observable phenotype on heterologous expression of this enzyme in M. smegmatis (8Yuan Y. Crane D.C. Musser J.M. Sreevatsan S. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10041-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Heat-inactivated lysates ofM. tuberculosis did show the incorporation of label into long-chain precursors when incubated with the recombinant MMAS-1 fusion protein, again consistent with the phenotypic data (data not shown). MMAS-3 alone also failed to show in vitro activity, consistent with the hypothesis that this enzyme requires the hydroxymethyl meromycolyl precursor produced by MMAS-4. Mixing MMAS-3 and MMAS-4 with M. smegmatis acceptor (Fig. 3 F) produced two series of long-chain products, one coeluting with the MMAS-4 product and the other significantly less polar (presumably the corresponding methyl ether). Examination of these assays by evaporative light-scattering detection showed that the amount of lipid material being radiolabeled was exceedingly small, suggesting relatively limited pools of such precursors are available in growing cells. We could also observe cell-free methyl(en)ation of mycolate precursors in crude lysates of recombinant M. smegmatis strains overproducing various enzymes (data not shown). In general this activity was more robust than that observed by producing the enzyme and substrate separately. This system was less useful for further study, however, because 1) chain length identification was difficult because of the potential for elongation of precursor molecules by the endogenous fatty acid synthase II system, and 2) characterization of the substrate was complicated by the presence of both enzyme and substrate in the same crude mixture. In vitro methyl(ene) transfer could be entirely inhibited by low micromolar concentrations ofS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, the demethylated analog of SAM (Fig. 2 F). This level of inhibition was similar to that seen with other methyltransferases (19Pugh C.S.G. Borchardt R.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and was also observe"

Accordingly, DAHP has been widely employed to distinguish whether de novo BH4 synthesis is required in a given biological system. Although it has been assumed that DAHP inhibits GTPCH by direct competition with substrate GTP, this has never been formally demonstrated. In view of apparent structural homology between DAHP and BH4, we questioned whether DAHP may mimic BH4 in its inhibition of GTPCH by an indirect mechanism, involving interaction with a recently cloned 9.5-kDa protein termed GTPCH FeedbackRegulatory Protein (GFRP). We show by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction that GFRP mRNA is constitutively expressed in rat aortic smooth muscle cells and further induced by treatment with immunostimulants. Moreover, functional GFRP is expressed and immunostimulant-induced BH4 accumulates in sufficient quantity to trigger feedback inhibition of GTPCH. Studies with DAHP reveal that GFRP is also essential to achieve potent inhibition of GTPCH. Indeed, DAHP inhibits GTPCH by dual mechanisms. At a relatively low concentration, DAHP emulates BH4 and engages the GFRP-dependent feedback inhibitory system; at higher concentrations, DAHP competes directly for binding with GTP substrate. This knowledge predicts that DAHP would preferably target GTPCH in tissues with abundant GFRP. 2,4-Diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) is considered to be a selective and direct-acting inhibitor of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway for synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).

Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because BH4 availability appears to limit the activity of these enzymes, BH4 levels may dictate the rate of production of key cell-signaling molecules, NO, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin. In mammalian cells,de novo synthesis of BH4 originates from GTP via the sequential action of three enzymes; the first and rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway is GTP cyclohydrolase (GTPCH) (2Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of understanding GTPCH regulation is highlighted by the knowledge that intracellular BH4 levels are determined by GTPCH activity, and mutations in the GTPCH gene are responsible for severe diseases including 3,4-dehydroxyphenylalanine-responsive dystonia (3Ozelius L.J. Breakefield X.O. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and cases of atypical phenylketonuria (4Niederwieser A. Shintaku H. Hasler T. Curtius H.C. Lehmann H.

The crystal structure of the enzyme from Escherichia coli (>70% amino acid homology to mouse, rat, and human GTPCH) reveals that GTPCH is a homodecamer, comprised of two pentameric toroids assembled face-to-face (5Nar H.

Interestingly, the mammalian GTPCHs, but not those from bacteria, are subject to feedback inhibition by BH4. Feedback inhibition by BH4 is mediated by a decrease in Vmax and is noncompetitive with GTP (6Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Pterins other than BH4, particularly dihydro- and tetrahydro- species, also attenuate GTPCH activity via this inhibitory mechanism (7Shen R.S. Alam A. Zhang Y.X. Biochim. Biophys.

Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) whose cDNA has recently been cloned and found to encode a 9.5-kDa protein, “GFRP” (GTPCH feedback regulatory protein) (8Milstien S.

Northern blot analysis revealed that GFRP mRNA is abundant in liver and kidney, but detectable in all other tissues examined (heart, brain, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, and testis) (8Milstien S.

Based on the finding that GFRP is a homopentamer, it has been speculated that one GFRP pentamer binds to each of GTPCH's pentameric surfaces (9Yoneyama T. Brewer J.M. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of GFRP-dependent feedback inhibition is its reversal by elevated levels of Phe (6Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K.

In the absence of BH4, it is notable that Phe induces complex formation between GTPCH and GFRP, resulting in a reduced Km for GTP and change in kinetic behavior from sigmoidal to hyperbolic (6Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus a Phe-rich meal can elicit enhanced levels of BH4. Because BH4 is the rate-limiting cofactor of Phe hydroxylase, this mode of GTPCH regulation protects against toxic accumulation of Phe and may thus serve an important cytoprotective function.Immunostimulant-induced NO synthesis has been shown to be prevented when BH4 synthesis is inhibited in smooth muscle cells (10Gross S.S.

In reports such as the above, investigators have tested for a role of de novo BH4 synthesis in biological systems by taking advantage of the only agent which is generally considered to be a direct-acting and specific inhibitor of GTPCH, 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP). Although DAHP is theprototypic GTPCH inhibitor, we questioned whether its mode of action is indeed direct. As an analog of GTP (Fig.1), DAHP has been assumed to compete for the binding of substrate to GTPCH and therefore be a direct-acting competitive inhibitor. However, based on apparent structural homology with BH4 (Fig. 1) and other pterins, we considered that DAHP might also inhibit GTPCH indirectly by a mechanism involving GFRP. Herein we provide evidence that indirect inhibition of GTPCH, mediated via GFRP, occurs at significantly lower concentrations of DAHP than those needed for direct-acting competitive inhibition. This predominant mode of inhibition predicts that the potency of DAHP for inhibiting GTPCH would increase with intracellular GFRP content, explaining disparities in the relative ability of DAHP to block BH4 synthesis in different tissues.

Because BH4 availability appears to limit the activity of these enzymes, BH4 levels may dictate the rate of production of key cell-signaling molecules, NO, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin.

Heavy metals play an important role in the metabolism of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Zinc, copper, cobalt, and nickel are essential for functional activity and/or structural stability of a large variety of proteins (1Feinberg H. Greenblatt H.M. Shoham G. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1993; 33: 501-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Nies D.H. Plasmid. 1992; 27: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Underwood E.J. J. Hum. Nutr. 1981; 35: 37-48PubMed Google Scholar), while other metals, such as mercury and lead, are toxic, and their accumulation in the cell has inhibitory effects on various cell functions (4Goyer R.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 5Chang L.W. J. Toxicol. Sci. Suppl. 1990; 4: 125-151Crossref Google Scholar). High concentrations of essential heavy metals could also be deleterious; consequently, cells must precisely regulate their availability (6Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Two basic mechanisms of heavy metal resistance have been identified: intracellular sequestration through formation of complexes with metal-specific proteins (such as phytochelatins in plants and yeast, or metallothioneins in animals, plants, yeast, and cyanobacteria), and reduced accumulation based on an active efflux of the cation (found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes) (7Silver S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 753-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Some of the heavy metal binding and transporting proteins, including metallothioneins and copper-transporting P-type ATPases of mammals, bacteria, and yeast were remarkably preserved during evolution, suggesting that certain ways of regulation of essential microelements are very similar for eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (8Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 897-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar).Zinc plays a particularly important role in cell homeostasis. More than 300 known enzymes require zinc for their catalytic functions. The essential role of zinc in protein structure stabilization and folding has been illustrated by the discovery and characterization of the eukaryotic zinc finger transcription factors and the large family of hormone receptor proteins (8Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 897-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Appreciation of the importance of zinc for cell metabolism has stimulated genetic studies aimed at the identification of zinc-binding and zinc-transporting proteins in various cells and organisms. During the last 5 years, a number of novel genes encoding zinc-transporting and zinc-binding proteins have been identified (9Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 10Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 11Hogstrand C. Gassman N.J. Popova B. Wood C.M. Walsh P.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 2453-2554Google Scholar), but still very little is known as to how the corresponding proteins work and how their expression is regulated.Recently, transposon mutagenesis was used to show that ZntA, a novel member of the heavy metal transporting subfamily of P-type ATPases, is essential for zinc and cadmium resistance in Escherichia coli (12Beard S. Hashim R. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Hughes M.N. Polle R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In everted vesicles, ZntA transports both cadmium and zinc with efficiency that is 4 times higher for zinc than for cadmium (6Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Whether this dual specificity is encoded in the ZntA structure or whether other protein(s) modulate ZntA specificity toward transported metals is still unknown. Thus, it remains unclear how ZntA removes excess of cadmium from the cytosol without depleting the cell of zinc. It seems very likely that fine-tune regulation of cellular zinc concentration requires participation of zinc-specific proteins, which would bind to rather nonselective transporters and modulate their cation specificity.Gene disruption followed by zinc sensitivity assay was proven to be a very useful approach for identification of the genes essential for zinc and cadmium efflux (6Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 12Beard S. Hashim R. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Hughes M.N. Polle R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, genes encoding regulatory or signaling molecules important for fine-tune balancing of zinc that do not belong to the same operon as a transporter could easily be missed in such a screen, since it is unlikely that disruption of these genes would completely eliminate zinc resistance. Consequently, for the identification of proteins that are not primary transporters but otherwise are intimately involved in zinc metabolism, certain biochemical criteria may be used. These criteria include specific regulation of protein expression by zinc, ability of proteins to bind zinc selectively, correlation between the expression of protein of interest and cells' ability to maintain optimal zinc concentration, etc.In this paper, we provide biochemical evidence that YJAI, a protein with previously unknown function, could be an important component of zinc-balancing machinery in E. coli. The identification of this protein was a result of cloning, heterologous expression and characterization of PMTR (Proteus mirabilis transcription regulator), a novel MerR-like transcription regulator from P. mirabilis that specifically increases endogenous zinc resistance in E. coli.DISCUSSIONE. coli has an endogenous mechanism of regulation of zinc availability, the first important component of which, ZntA, a zinc/cadmium-transporting P1-type ATPase, had been recently identified (6Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although ZntA was shown to be a key enzyme providing ATP-dependent zinc efflux, it was also demonstrated to lack the unique selectivity to zinc. Other proteins that could be involved in specific zinc-signaling events, selective uptake of zinc, zinc-dependent regulation of transcription, or transport activity remain uncharacterized. In this study we report identification and characterization of two proteins, expression of which in E. coli is associated with specific increase in cell resistance to zinc.The endogenous regulation of zinc availability in E. coliseems rather effective since cell growth is essentially unaffected when concentration of zinc in the medium is increased up to 0.5 mm. Further increase of zinc concentration (>0.6 mm) leads to inhibition of growth, indicating that the regulatory capacity of the system has been saturated. However, E. coli cells can grow normally even at 1 mm zinc if transformed with the PROT2 plasmid. We demonstrate that this effect is due to the presence of a small gene in PROT2, which encodes a 135-amino acid protein that we named PMTR.PMTR specifically enhances the cell's ability to grow in zinc and has no effect on resistance to nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, or iron, suggesting that it mimics the effect of endogenous protein(s) involved in zinc-balancing in E. coli. Strong sequence homology of PMTR to YBBI and YHDM suggests that these two putative E. coli proteins could be the functional analogs of PMTR. In fact, the possible role of YHDM in zinc-dependent regulation of transcription was recently predicted based on the in vitroexperiments with YHDM/MerR chimeric molecules (24Brocklehurst K. Morby A. ASBMB Fall Symposia: Copper and Zinc in Signalling, Trafficking and Disease, Tahoe City, CA, October 24–27, 1997. 1997; (abstr.)Google Scholar). Our study offers some clues for the possible function of these products in vivo.Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that PMTR is a new member of a large family of MerR-like transcription activators (Fig.2). MerR represses transcription by binding tightly to the “mer” operator region in the absence of mercury. When mercury is present, the dimeric MerR complex binds a single ion and becomes a potent transcriptional activator. In Streptomyces lividans, transcriptional MerR-like activator TipA regulates transcription upon specific binding of antibiotic thiostrepton at concentrations of thiostrepton as low as 10−10 to 10−9m (27Holmes D.J. Caso J.L. Thompson C.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3183-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, the other member of MerR family, BmrR, activates transcription from the multidrug transporter gene, bmr, after binding either rhodamine or tetraphenylphosphonium (28Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these various members of the MerR family are highly homologous in their N-terminal portion, which includes the characteristic “helix-turn-helix” DNA-binding motif. The variable C-terminal portions of these proteins are involved in specific binding of the stimulating ligand and are structurally dissimilar.The N-terminal half of the PMTR protein sequence has high homology to the DNA-binding region of MerR-like proteins (Fig. 2), which strongly points to the role of PMTR in DNA-binding and transcription regulation. The C-terminal ligand-binding region does not have strong homology with the ligand-binding sites of MerR or other biochemically characterized members of the family, suggesting that PMTR is regulated by its own specific ligand.Our data suggest that PMTR could be a zinc-dependent transcription activator involved in zinc homeostasis in bacterial cells. The transformation with PMTR plasmid specifically confers resistance to zinc and not to any other heavy metals tested. In addition, PMTR stimulates expression of the 12-kDa protein only in the presence of zinc, the amount of which correlates with the cell's ability to tolerate high concentrations of this metal (Fig. 4). Future studies on characterization of the DNA-binding and metal-binding properties of recombinant PMTR will precisely determine the DNA and ligand specificity of this transcription regulator.It is quite possible that PMTR or its functional E. colianalogs regulate a number of genes, the coexpression and cooperation of which lead to the observed increase in zinc tolerance. The experiments are currently under way to identify all genes that are expressed due to the simultaneous presence of transcription regulator and zinc. Our current results suggest that one of such genes is yjai, and offer some clues to the possible function of the corresponding protein.It is evident that the expression of YJAI protein in both control and PMTR-containing cells is specifically induced by increasing concentration of zinc in the medium (Fig. 5 A), and that the amount of C-terminal fragment of the YJAI released to the periplasm correlates with the ability of cells to grow at elevated concentrations of zinc (Fig. 4). Zinc-dependent expression of the full-length YJAI has not been demonstrated directly; however, zinc-dependent accumulation of the 12-kDa fragment and the absence of the corresponding amounts of the full-length precursor in the zinc-free media strongly suggests that the expression of the YJAI, and not just cleavage, are stimulated by zinc. To the best of our knowledge, such a highly selective effect of zinc on protein expression, as we see for YJAI, has not been demonstrated for any otherE. coli protein including ZntA, pointing to the unique role of YJAI for zinc homeostasis.We demonstrated that the 12-kDa C-terminal fragment of YJAI is released to the periplasm and can bind zinc with significant selectivity (zinc > cobalt ≫ cadmium) (Fig. 8). The 20-kDa periplasmic spy protein, which was produced at 1 mm ZnCl2and which contains comparable amounts of His residues, does not show any binding to metal-equilibrated resin, confirming that the observed metal binding of the 12-kDa protein is specific. The dramatic difference in binding of the 12-kDa protein to zinc- and cadmium-equilibrated columns is particularly important. Chemical properties of zinc and cadmium are similar, and cadmium is known to be able to substitute for zinc in many enzymes (29Zhang F.L. Fu H.W. Casey P.J. Bishop W.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8166-8171Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, cadmium is bigger than zinc, whereas zinc, nickel, and cobalt are similar in size. Consequently, the preferential binding of the 12-kDa protein to one column and not to the other indicates that specific protein structure rather than mere presence of histidine residues governs the observed protein-metal interactions. The 65Zn-binding and competition studies with various metals further confirmed the ability of the C terminus of YJAI to bind zinc specifically (Fig. 9,A and B).Some properties of YJAI, such as its specific induction in the presence of zinc, the localization of the C-terminal domain of this protein in the periplasm, and the ability of the 12-kDa fragment to bind zinc much strongly than cadmium, make the YJAI protein an excellent candidate for the role of the modulator of cation selectivity of metal transporters, such as ZntA. Alternatively, zinc complex of the 12-kDa protein can serve as an inhibitor of low affinity metal uptake proteins, such as the manganese transporter, which has broad specificity for various divalent cations including zinc (30Bartsevich V.V.

Future studies of the protein-protein interactions and characterization of the mutant strain lacking YJAI would verify which of these hypothesis is correct.Currently, the data demonstrate that cell response to the increasing zinc concentration may include zinc-dependent expression of YJAI, followed by relocation of this protein to the membrane, binding of zinc by the C-terminal fragment of YJAI, accompanied by selective proteolytic cleavage and release of the protein-zinc complex into the periplasm. It is interesting that cleavage of YJAI occurs at the HGGHGM site. It is possible that binding of zinc at this region induces a conformational change and exposes this segment for the proteolytic (autolytic) attack. Alternatively, cleavage of YJAI may not require zinc, and the 12-kDa C-terminal fragment is released to periplasm in a metal-free form and binds zinc later.The name “YJAI” is an abbreviation that was initially used to describe this putative E. coli protein, and does not reflect functional properties of the protein. It is also very difficult to pronounce; thus, in future we would like to refer to YJAI as “zinc resistance-associated protein” or “ZRAP.”In conclusion, we have identified a novel transcription regulator, PMTR, responsible for the increased zinc resistance in E. coli and found that PMTR has significant sequence homology to two endogenous E. coli proteins, YHDM and YBBI. We demonstrate that in the presence of zinc, PMTR induces accumulation of the previously uncharacterized protein YJAI (ZRAP). Characterization of YJAI revealed that it can selectively bind zinc in the periplasm, and that the expression of this protein is precisely stimulated by zinc in a concentration-dependent manner. All data together indicate that YJAI could be an important component of zinc-balancing mechanism in E. coli. Heavy metals play an important role in the metabolism of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Zinc, copper, cobalt, and nickel are essential for functional activity and/or structural stability of a large variety of proteins (1Feinberg H. Greenblatt H.M. Shoham G. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1993; 33: 501-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Nies D.H. Plasmid. 1992; 27: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Underwood E.J. J. Hum. Nutr. 1981; 35: 37-48PubMed Google Scholar), while other metals, such as mercury and lead, are toxic, and their accumulation in the cell has inhibitory effects on various cell functions (4Goyer R.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 5Chang L.W. J. Toxicol. Sci. Suppl. 1990; 4: 125-151Crossref Google Scholar). High concentrations of essential heavy metals could also be deleterious; consequently, cells must precisely regulate their availability (6Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Two basic mechanisms of heavy metal resistance have been identified: intracellular sequestration through formation of complexes with metal-specific proteins (such as phytochelatins in plants and yeast, or metallothioneins in animals, plants, yeast, and cyanobacteria), and reduced accumulation based on an active efflux of the cation (found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes) (7Silver S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 753-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Some of the heavy metal binding and transporting proteins, including metallothioneins and copper-transporting P-type ATPases of mammals, bacteria, and yeast were remarkably preserved during evolution, suggesting that certain ways of regulation of essential microelements are very similar for eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (8Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 897-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Zinc plays a particularly important role in cell homeostasis. More than 300 known enzymes require zinc for their catalytic functions. The essential role of zinc in protein structure stabilization and folding has been illustrated by the discovery and characterization of the eukaryotic zinc finger transcription factors and the large family of hormone receptor proteins (8Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 897-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Appreciation of the importance of zinc for cell metabolism has stimulated genetic studies aimed at the identification of zinc-binding and zinc-transporting proteins in various cells and organisms. During the last 5 years, a number of novel genes encoding zinc-transporting and zinc-binding proteins have been identified (9Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 10Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 11Hogstrand C. Gassman N.J. Popova B. Wood C.M. Walsh P.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 2453-2554Google Scholar), but still very little is known as to how the corresponding proteins work and how their expression is regulated. Recently, transposon mutagenesis was used to show that ZntA, a novel member of the heavy metal transporting subfamily of P-type ATPases, is essential for zinc and cadmium resistance in Escherichia coli (12Beard S. Hashim R. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Hughes M.N. Polle R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In everted vesicles, ZntA transports both cadmium and zinc with efficiency that is 4 times higher for zinc than for cadmium (6Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Whether this dual specificity is encoded in the ZntA structure or whether other protein(s) modulate ZntA specificity toward transported metals is still unknown. Thus, it remains unclear how ZntA removes excess of cadmium from the cytosol without depleting the cell of zinc. It seems very likely that fine-tune regulation of cellular zinc concentration requires participation of zinc-specific proteins, which would bind to rather nonselective transporters and modulate their cation specificity. Gene disruption followed by zinc sensitivity assay was proven to be a very useful approach for identification of the genes essential for zinc and cadmium efflux (6Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 12Beard S. Hashim R. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Hughes M.N. Polle R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, genes encoding regulatory or signaling molecules important for fine-tune balancing of zinc that do not belong to the same operon as a transporter could easily be missed in such a screen, since it is unlikely that disruption of these genes would completely eliminate zinc resistance. Consequently, for the identification of proteins that are not primary transporters but otherwise are intimately involved in zinc metabolism, certain biochemical criteria may be used. These criteria include specific regulation of protein expression by zinc, ability of proteins to bind zinc selectively, correlation between the expression of protein of interest and cells' ability to maintain optimal zinc concentration, etc. In this paper, we provide biochemical evidence that YJAI, a protein with previously unknown function, could be an important component of zinc-balancing machinery in E. coli. The identification of this protein was a result of cloning, heterologous expression and characterization of PMTR (Proteus mirabilis transcription regulator), a novel MerR-like transcription regulator from P. mirabilis that specifically increases endogenous zinc resistance in E. coli. DISCUSSIONE. coli has an endogenous mechanism of regulation of zinc availability, the first important component of which, ZntA, a zinc/cadmium-transporting P1-type ATPase, had been recently identified (6Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although ZntA was shown to be a key enzyme providing ATP-dependent zinc efflux, it was also demonstrated to lack the unique selectivity to zinc. Other proteins that could be involved in specific zinc-signaling events, selective uptake of zinc, zinc-dependent regulation of transcription, or transport activity remain uncharacterized. In this study we report identification and characterization of two proteins, expression of which in E. coli is associated with specific increase in cell resistance to zinc.The endogenous regulation of zinc availability in E. coliseems rather effective since cell growth is essentially unaffected when concentration of zinc in the medium is increased up to 0.5 mm. Further increase of zinc concentration (>0.6 mm) leads to inhibition of growth, indicating that the regulatory capacity of the system has been saturated. However, E. coli cells can grow normally even at 1 mm zinc if transformed with the PROT2 plasmid. We demonstrate that this effect is due to the presence of a small gene in PROT2, which encodes a 135-amino acid protein that we named PMTR.PMTR specifically enhances the cell's ability to grow in zinc and has no effect on resistance to nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, or iron, suggesting that it mimics the effect of endogenous protein(s) involved in zinc-balancing in E. coli. Strong sequence homology of PMTR to YBBI and YHDM suggests that these two putative E. coli proteins could be the functional analogs of PMTR. In fact, the possible role of YHDM in zinc-dependent regulation of transcription was recently predicted based on the in vitroexperiments with YHDM/MerR chimeric molecules (24Brocklehurst K. Morby A. ASBMB Fall Symposia: Copper and Zinc in Signalling, Trafficking and Disease, Tahoe City, CA, October 24–27, 1997. 1997; (abstr.)Google Scholar). Our study offers some clues for the possible function of these products in vivo.Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that PMTR is a new member of a large family of MerR-like transcription activators (Fig.2). MerR represses transcription by binding tightly to the “mer” operator region in the absence of mercury. When mercury is present, the dimeric MerR complex binds a single ion and becomes a potent transcriptional activator. In Streptomyces lividans, transcriptional MerR-like activator TipA regulates transcription upon specific binding of antibiotic thiostrepton at concentrations of thiostrepton as low as 10−10 to 10−9m (27Holmes D.J. Caso J.L. Thompson C.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3183-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, the other member of MerR family, BmrR, activates transcription from the multidrug transporter gene, bmr, after binding either rhodamine or tetraphenylphosphonium (28Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these various members of the MerR family are highly homologous in their N-terminal portion, which includes the characteristic “helix-turn-helix” DNA-binding motif. The variable C-terminal portions of these proteins are involved in specific binding of the stimulating ligand and are structurally dissimilar.The N-terminal half of the PMTR protein sequence has high homology to the DNA-binding region of MerR-like proteins (Fig. 2), which strongly points to the role of PMTR in DNA-binding and transcription regulation. The C-terminal ligand-binding region does not have strong homology with the ligand-binding sites of MerR or other biochemically characterized members of the family, suggesting that PMTR is regulated by its own specific ligand.Our data suggest that PMTR could be a zinc-dependent transcription activator involved in zinc homeostasis in bacterial cells. The transformation with PMTR plasmid specifically confers resistance to zinc and not to any other heavy metals tested. In addition, PMTR stimulates expression of the 12-kDa protein only in the presence of zinc, the amount of which correlates with the cell's ability to tolerate high concentrations of this metal (Fig. 4). Future studies on characterization of the DNA-binding and metal-binding properties of recombinant PMTR will precisely determine the DNA and ligand specificity of this transcription regulator.It is quite possible that PMTR or its functional E. colianalogs regulate a number of genes, the coexpression and cooperation of which lead to the observed increase in zinc tolerance. The experiments are currently under way to identify all genes that are expressed due to the simultaneous presence of transcription regulator and zinc. Our current results suggest that one of such genes is yjai, and offer some clues to the possible function of the corresponding protein.It is evident that the expression of YJAI protein in both control and PMTR-containing cells is specifically induced by increasing concentration of zinc in the medium (Fig. 5 A), and that the amount of C-terminal fragment of the YJAI released to the periplasm correlates with the ability of cells to grow at elevated concentrations of zinc (Fig. 4). Zinc-dependent expression of the full-length YJAI has not been demonstrated directly; however, zinc-dependent accumulation of the 12-kDa fragment and the absence of the corresponding amounts of the full-length precursor in the zinc-free media strongly suggests that the expression of the YJAI, and not just cleavage, are stimulated by zinc. To the best of our knowledge, such a highly selective effect of zinc on protein expression, as we see for YJAI, has not been demonstrated for any otherE. coli protein including ZntA, pointing to the unique role of YJAI for zinc homeostasis.We demonstrated that the 12-kDa C-terminal fragment of YJAI is released to the periplasm and can bind zinc with significant selectivity (zinc > cobalt ≫ cadmium) (Fig. 8). The 20-kDa periplasmic spy protein, which was produced at 1 mm ZnCl2and which contains comparable amounts of His residues, does not show any binding to metal-equilibrated resin, confirming that the observed metal binding of the 12-kDa protein is specific. The dramatic difference in binding of the 12-kDa protein to zinc- and cadmium-equilibrated columns is particularly important. Chemical properties of zinc and cadmium are similar, and cadmium is known to be able to substitute for zinc in many enzymes (29Zhang F.L. Fu H.W. Casey P.J. Bishop W.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8166-8171Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, cadmium is bigger than zinc, whereas zinc, nickel, and cobalt are similar in size. Consequently, the preferential binding of the 12-kDa protein to one column and not to the other indicates that specific protein structure rather than mere presence of histidine residues governs the observed protein-metal interactions. The 65Zn-binding and competition studies with various metals further confirmed the ability of the C terminus of YJAI to bind zinc specifically (Fig. 9,A and B).Some properties of YJAI, such as its specific induction in the presence of zinc, the localization of the C-terminal domain of this protein in the periplasm, and the ability of the 12-kDa fragment to bind zinc much strongly than cadmium, make the YJAI protein an excellent candidate for the role of the modulator of cation selectivity of metal transporters, such as ZntA. Alternatively, zinc complex of the 12-kDa protein can serve as an inhibitor of low affinity metal uptake proteins, such as the manganese transporter, which has broad specificity for various divalent cations including zinc (30Bartsevich V.V.

Antibodies to EAST recognize a 68-kDa protein that is present in most chicken tissues. An epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent association between the EGF receptor (EGFR) and EAST was shown by reciprocal immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting studies with specific antibodies. Activated EGFR catalyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of EAST, as judged by an in vitro kinase assay with both immunoprecipitated and purified EGFR. Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experiments also demonstrated an association between EAST and eps15, an EGFR substrate associated with clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, which is essential in the endocytotic pathway. The association between EAST and eps15 was not affected by EGF treatment. In immunofluorescence microscopy, EAST was shown to partially colocalize with clathrin. The sequence of the NH2-terminal portion of EAST shows a high degree of similarity with a group of proteins involved in endocytosis or vesicle trafficking.

In the case of receptor tyrosine kinases and receptor tyrosine kinase-induced intracellular signaling, such protein interactions are mediated by distinct protein domains. Among these, the Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2Src homology 2SH3Src homology 3EGFepidermal growth factorEGFREGF receptorTAMtyrosine-based activation motifaaamino acid(s)CEHFchicken embryo heart fibroblastPCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHAhemagglutininPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidSTAMsignal transducing adaptor molecule. domain, which binds Tyr(P) residues in a specific context, and the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which binds sequences characterized by polyproline tracts, are the best known (2Ren R.

Today. 1992; 13: 63-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). TAM-containing receptors lack an intrinsic kinase activity and use TAM motifs to recruit and activate nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, such as members of the Src and Syk families (6Songyuan Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Rafnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell.

Many of the known signaling pathways are still only partially characterized, and their regulation is poorly understood, rendering the search for new interacting proteins a topic of high priority. For instance, elimination of critical SH2-binding sites of the platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors does not abrogate mitogenic signaling, suggesting that as yet unidentified proteins interact with these receptors (7Yu J.C.

The identification of novel receptor-associated components is also required to fill the gaps in our knowledge of the internalization of receptor tyrosine kinases (9Riezman H. Woodman P.G. van Meer G. Marsh M. Cell. 1997; 91: 731-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The internalization of these receptors contributes to their down-regulation and thus is an important part of signal transduction (10Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Eps15 is phosphorylated by EGFR in response to the activation of the latter by EGF. The unique domain structure of eps15 makes this protein a novel type of EGFR substrate. However, no direct interaction between the EGFR and eps15 could be shown. More recently, a specific interaction between the SH3 domain of Crk and the conserved proline-rich motif of eps15 was demonstrated, suggesting that Crk could mediate the binding of eps15 to the EGFR (13Schumacher C.

Intriguingly, eps15 binds to proteins operating in endocytosis, such as α-adaptin (14Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Begue B. Megarbane B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J.

In this paper, we describe the cloning, the primary structure and functional properties of a new signal transduction protein that associates with the EGFR and eps15. Because of its binding properties and domain structure, we have named it EGF receptor-associated protein with SH3- andTAM domains (EAST). We suggest that EAST, together with eps15, is involved in EGFR-mediated signaling and in the regulation of the endocytotic machinery. Standard solutions, buffers, and procedures for the purification and precipitation of DNA, restriction enzyme digestion, and ligation reactions were as described in Sambrooket al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing was done by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar), using the T7 Sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or using an automated ABI PRISM 377XL DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from the Oligonucleotide Core Facility of Biocenter Oulu or from Pharmacia. For sequence analysis and alignments, the GCG, CLUSTAL W, and COILS programs were used. Fragments of mRNAs encoding for SH3 domain-containing proteins expressed in chicken brain were amplified by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using degenerate oligonucleotide primers (20Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The original clone of EAST was extended by PCR cloning from different chicken libraries and from RNA and by library screening with cDNA probes. The libraries used included a chicken brain cDNA library (5′Stretch) cloned in λgt10 and λgt11 vectors (CLONTECH) and a chicken genomic library in the EMBL SP6/T7 vector (CLONTECH). RNAs were prepared as described earlier (20Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was done using the 5′AmpliFINDER rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (CLONTECH). Library screening was performed as follows. Filters containing ∼1 × 104 plaques/filter were incubated overnight with an EAST probe in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SET-buffer, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 50 μg of yeast tRNA). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using an Oligolabeling Kit (Pharmacia). After washing several times with 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 1% SDS at 42 °C, autoradiography was performed overnight on x-ray film (Kodak). Positive plaques were then collected, plated, and rescreened. The cDNA corresponding to the nucleotides 60–231 of the coding region of EAST was amplified by PCR and used as a probe. Preparation of total RNAs and mRNAs were as described previously (20Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the hybridization was performed as above. Cultures of chicken embryo heart fibroblasts (CEHF) were established, and the cells were grown as described previously (20Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HER-14 cells (a gift from Dr. J. Schlessinger, New York University Medical Center), expressing ∼1 × 104 EGFR/cell (21Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H.M. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B). Cells were serum-starved for 12–16 h in 0.2% fetal bovine serum and then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml). HeLa cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics (see above). The anti-EAST antibody was prepared as follows. A GST-EAST fusion protein was produced by cloning the cDNA corresponding to the amino acids 4–188 of the EAST coding region into the pGEX-2-TK vector (Pharmacia) and having it expressed inEscherichia coli (DH5α). The fusion protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia) and was used as an antigen to immunize rabbits. The antisera were collected and affinity-purified on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) coated with the corresponding fusion protein. Anti-GST activity was preadsorbed by incubating the affinity-purified antibodies with a recombinant GST coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-EGFR antibodies were generous gifts from Dr. J. Schlessinger. Monoclonal anti-eps15 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Pier Paolo Di Fiore (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy). Polyclonal anti-eps15 (sc-534) and anti-HA (sc-805) antibodies and the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) was from Boehringer Mannheim. Monoclonal anti-clathrin antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG-agaroses were from Sigma. Immunoblotting of tissues and cells was carried out essentially as described previously (20Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells, grown to 70–90% confluency, were washed with ice-cold PBS and then scraped in a lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 μmZnCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 ×g, and the supernatants were collected and used in the assays. For immunoprecipitations, 1–4 mg of proteins were used. Antibodies were added to the cleared lysates and incubated on a nutator for 2 h at 4 °C. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads were then added, and the incubation was continued for another 2 h at 4 °C. In some cases, cells were pretreated by incubating them with a secondary conjugate for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 3–5 times with the lysis buffer and then boiled in 2× Laemmli's sample buffer for 5 min. The solubilized immunoprecipitates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Semi-Dry blotter (KemTech), and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The blots were developed by the ECL method. For repetitive probing, the filters were stripped for 40 min at 62 °C in a stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), washed extensively, and reprobed. The in vitro immunocomplex kinase assay was performed as follows. HER-14 cells were lysed (as above), and the lysates were used for immunoprecipitation using a monoconal anti-EGFR antibody and anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). They were then resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing unlabeled ATP at a final concentration of 50 μm. Incubation was carried out for 20 min at 4 °C. The complexes were then washed twice with kinase buffer to remove the excess ATP. 5 μg of normal or mutated recombinant EAST protein and 6 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP were added, and the mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. EAST was then collected by incubating with either glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads or anti-EAST antibody-conjugated IgG-agarose. The beads were then washed twice with kinase buffer, boiled in 2× Laemmli's sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (as above) and autoradiography. The direct phosphorylation assay using a purified EGFR kinase domain (Stratagene) was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs used for transfection experiments were produced by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The HA epitope tag was added to the COOH terminus of the constructs by primer design. The authenticity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The NH2-terminal (aa 1–205) and COOH-terminal (aa 260–469) constructs were subcloned into theEcoRI/HindIII cloning site of the pRK5 transfection vector (a gift from Dr. J. Schlessinger). Transient transfections were done using FUGENE 6-reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutations were produced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For immunofluorescence microscopy, the cells were grown on glass coverslips. Cells were washed in Hanks' salt solution and then fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PEM buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Triton X-100). After washing in PBS, the cells were incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS-glycine for 30 min. They were then overlaid with primary antibody for 30 min, washed, and incubated with either Texas Red-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Caltag Laboratories) for another 30 min. Double-staining experiments were performed as described previously (20Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cells were viewed under an Olympus BH2 fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters. The full-length, NH2-terminal (aa 1–205) and COOH-terminal (aa 260–469) sequences were amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The products were subcloned into theBamHI/EcoRI cloning site of the pGEX-2-TK expression vector (Pharmacia). Mutations were introduced as described above, and the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1–0.5 mm) at room temperature for 4–8 h. Cells were spun down, resuspended in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia). The beads were washed several times in PBS, and the fusion protein was eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0. The amino acid sequence of EAST, deduced from the full-length cDNA isolated, and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures,” is shown in Fig.1 A. The protein consists of 468 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 52,406 Da. The methionine start codon is in partial agreement with the Kozak consensus sequence. The open reading frame ends with two sequential in-frame stop codons, followed by a putative polyadenylation signal about 300 nucleotides downstream (not shown). An SH3 domain is located in the middle of the sequence (aa 206–259). A sequence similar to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif or TAM domains of several immunoreceptors, integrin β4, and STAM, is present in the COOH-terminal half of the sequence (aa 356–375) (Fig.2 A). Together with the high degree of overall similarity, the presence of the canonical pair of closely spaced tyrosines, followed by a leucine three residues downstream, suggests that this region is a genuine TAM. Secondary structure prediction analysis of EAST using the COILS program predicts a high propensity for α-helicity in the NH2 terminus (aa 160–225) and in the region partially overlapping the TAM (aa 330–365). A schematic representation of the structural features of EAST is given in Fig. 1 B.Figure 2Sequence alignments. A, sequence alignment of the TAM of EAST with a representative set of TAMs. B, alignment of the amino acid sequence of EAST with STAM, VPS27, Hrs, and Tom-1b.

The residues are shadedaccording to the following scheme: white letter on ablack background and black letter on a gray background when an identical residue or similarity, respectively, has an occurrence of more than 60% in a position. The accession numbers of the sequences are as follows: EAST, AJ224514; STAM, U43900; Tom-1b, Y08741; Hrs, D84064; VPS27, P40343.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A sequence homology search of the protein data banks revealed a high degree of overall similarity of EAST with the STAM (22Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the NH2-terminal half, the proteins are 68% identical (74% homologous). The SH3 domains are 84% identical (84% homologous). Lower degrees of identity (52%) and homology (59%) were seen in the COOH-terminal portion including the TAM. The COOH termini of EAST and STAM appear to be unique. Partial similarities were also found with some other proteins, including VPS27, a yeast protein involved in endocytotic trafficking (23Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), Hrs, a receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (24Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and Tom-1, a v-Myb target gene product (25Burk O. Worpenberg S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.-H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). The homologies were found within the first 200 amino acids of these proteins and were found not to reflect the presence of any known protein motif. Northern blot analysis of chicken tissues revealed a major RNA transcript of ∼1.9 kilobases that was present in about equal amounts in chicken brain, heart, liver, lung, gizzard, gut, skin, eye, skeletal muscle, and kidney (Fig.3 A). A weaker signal of 5 kilobases was also detected (data not shown), suggesting the possible existence of two closely related genes or of differential splicing events giving rise to two isoforms of EAST. The widespread expression of EAST was verified by immunoblot analysis using an affinity-purified anti-EAST antibody raised against the NH2 terminus of EAST (see “Experimental Procedures”). A single polypeptide band of ∼68 kDa was detected in almost all of the tissues and cells (Fig.3 B). The high relative electrophoretic mobility of EAST deviates considerably from its calculated molecular mass, suggesting a secondary structure that resists denaturation by boiling in 2-mercaptoethanol and SDS. The presence of a TAM domain in EAST prompted us to study the phosphorylation state of EAST in response to treatment with growth factors. HER-14 cells, stably transfected with EGFR cDNA (21Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H.M. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), were stimulated with EGF after overnight serum starvation. EAST was then immunoprecipitated with anti-EAST antibodies, and the precipitate was analyzed for phosphorylation by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As seen in Fig. 4, EAST was tyrosine-phosphorylated within 1 min of the EGF treatment and maintained a high level of phosphorylation for over 30 min. To investigate whether the phosphorylation of EAST was specific to EGF, we also tested the effect of platelet-derived growth factor, lysophosphatidic acid, phorbol myristic acid, and bradykinin. A low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of EAST could be detected after platelet-derived growth factor treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells but not after treatment with lysophosphatidic acid, phorbol myristic acid, or bradykinin (data not shown). Thus, the phosphorylation of EAST seems to be primarily associated with receptor tyrosine kinases and, in particular, with the EGFR. Several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, representing putative EAST-interacting proteins, co-precipitated with EAST (data not shown). The most prominent of these had a molecular mass of about 180 kDa, suggestive of EGFR. This was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-EGFR antibody (Fig.5 A). The co-immunoprecipitation of EGFR with EAST, seen even in serum-starved, nonstimulated cells, was clearly enhanced after EGF treatment (Fig.5 A). Immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFR antibodies and blotting with anti-EAST antibodies again demonstrated a distinct co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins, the extent of which was significantly increased upon EGF treatment (Fig. 5 B). The results demonstrate an EGF-dependent association between EGFR and EAST. To determine whether the EGF-induced phosphorylation of EAST is because of a direct action of EGFR or is mediated by some other proteins, we performed an in vitro immunocomplex kinase assay utilizing specific anti-EGFR antibodies to immunoprecipitate EGFR and bacterially produced EAST as a substrate; EAST was phosphorylated under these conditions (Fig. 6 A). Although suggestive of a direct effect of EGFR on EAST, it does not rule out the possibility that the phosphorylation is because of some other kinase(s) present in the immunocomplex. Therefore, the experiment was repeated by using purified, recombinant EGFR kinase domain and bacterially produced EAST. Fig. 6 B shows that EAST was also phosphorylated under these conditions. Then we repeated the experiment by digesting the fusion protein with thrombin, which leads to a cleavage of EAST from its fusion partner GST. A distinct phosphorylation of EAST was seen, verifying that EAST is the target of the kinase activity (Fig.6 B). We also made a preliminary attempt to characterize the sites of phosphorylation in EAST. For that purpose, NH2- and COOH-terminal parts of EAST were expressed as fusion proteins and subjected to phosphorylation assay as above. Phosphorylation of both fusion proteins was seen with a slightly stronger intensity in the NH2-terminal half (Fig. 6 B). These results strongly suggest that EAST is a direct substrate of EGFR. However, there are no typical motifs, such as SH2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains, that could serve as EGFR-binding sites in EAST. On the other hand, there are two tyrosine residues, Tyr359and Tyr372, in the TAM domain. By analogy with other TAM-containing proteins, these residues are potential phosphorylation sites. To investigate the possibility that they are the targets of the EGF-induced phosphorylation, both residues were mutated to phenylalanines, and the phosphorylation assay was repeated using the mutated EAST as a substrate. The results indicate that the wild-type and mutated EAST are phosphorylated to similar extents (Fig.6 B), suggesting that tyrosines other than Tyr359and Tyr372 of the TAM are the phosphorylation targets of the EGFR. Eps15 is an EGFR substrate (12Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) with a molecular mass of about 150 kDa. A band of about that size was present on the Tyr(P) immunoblot of the anti-EAST immunoprecipitate (data not shown). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experiments using anti-eps15 and anti-EAST antibodies revealed that eps15 and EAST co-immunoprecipitated. This association was independent of EGF treatment, because equal amounts of coprecipitated proteins were present in the immunocomplexes before and after treatment of HER-14 cells with EGF (Fig. 7). In vitro studies with synthetic peptides have shown that eps15 homology domains of eps15 recognize a short core motif, NPF, in interacting proteins (26Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A.

These data show that Rpg1p is an authentic eIF3 subunit and plays an important role in the initiation step of translation. Initiation of protein synthesis is a complex process requiring the participation of several factors promoting (a) the association of initiator tRNA with the 40 S ribosomal subunit in order to form the 43 S preinitiation complex; (b) the melting of secondary mRNA structures; (c) binding of the mRNA to the 43 S preinitiation complex; and (d) the addition of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to assemble an 80 S ribosome at the initiation codon (reviewed in Ref. 1Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). At this point, the initiation step of translation is accomplished, and the ribosome is committed to the elongation process. Up to now at least 10 proteins called initiation factors have been implicated in the initiation of protein synthesis (2Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W. B Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N.

Furthermore, eIF3 prevents dissociation of the Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex caused by the addition of RNA (9Gupta N.K. Roy A.L. Nag M.K. Kinzy T.G. MacMillan S. Hileman R.E. Dever T.E. Wu S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and probably also interacts with eIF4A (12Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. Shatkin A.J. Rose J.K. Leong K. Bergman J.E. Gordon J.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 15Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pain V.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 235: 625-637Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This indicates that eIF3 may be the major factor orchestrating the accurate positioning of mRNA for binding to the 40 S subunit and subsequent recognition of the initiation AUG codon (6Johnston K.J. Merrick W.C. Zoll W.L. Zhu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7106-7113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the timing of all translation initiation events as well as their coordination are only poorly understood. Thus, a characterization of not yet described proteins involved in that process can bring more light to our understanding of the mechanism of the initiation step of protein synthesis. Mammalian initiation factor 3 is composed of at least 10 nonidentical subunits (17Asano K. Vornlocher H.-P. Richter-Cook J.N. Merrick W.C. Hinnebush A.G. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27042-27052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that mammalian eIF3 directly interacts with the eIF4G subunit of eIF4F (10Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and that the largest subunit of eIF3, p180, interacts with eIF4B (11Methot N. Song M.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that p180 is necessary for binding and stabilization of the ternary complex (9Gupta N.K. Roy A.L. Nag M.K. Kinzy T.G. MacMillan S. Hileman R.E. Dever T.E. Wu S. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. McCarthy J.E.G. Tuite M.F. Post-transcriptional Control of Gene Expression. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 521-526Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that p180 plays a key role in all functions promoted by mammalian eIF3, resulting in formation of the 43 S mRNA complex. Only recently, mammalian p180 has been cloned and characterized (6Johnston K.J. Merrick W.C. Zoll W.L. Zhu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7106-7113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It shares significant sequence similarity withSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, andNicotiana tabacum proteins, which were suggested to probably represent the corresponding subunits of eIF3 in these organisms. Yeast eIF3 comprises eight subunits with apparent molecular masses ranging from 16 to 135 kDa (18Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Up to now, only four yeast homologues of mammalian eIF3 subunits have been identified. These are Prt1p, which exhibits a defect in Met-tRNAi binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunit in a corresponding conditional lethal mutant (19Moldave K. McLaughlin C.S. Tuite M.F. Picard F. Bolotin- Fukuhura M. Genetics of Translation. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988: 271-281Crossref Google Scholar); Nip1p, originally identified as a protein required for efficient nuclear transport in yeast (20Gu Z. Moerschell R.P. Sherman F. Goldfarb D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10355-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); Tif34p, a protein required for the assembly and maintenance of the eIF3 complex (21Naranda T. Kainuma M. MacMillan S. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Verlhac M-H. Chen R-H. Hanachi P. Hershey J.W.B. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6812-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); and Tif35p, a putative RNA-binding protein (22Verlhac M-H. Chen R-H. Hanachi P. Hershey J.W.B. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6812-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These proteins are homologous to the human eIF3 subunits p110, p116, p36, and p44, respectively. TheS. cerevisiae genome encodes one additional protein, p110, homologous to the human eIF3 subunit p180, which has not yet been identified and characterized. Yeast eIF3 also contains two previously described proteins, Gcd10p (23Garcia-Barrio M.T. Naranda T. Vasquez de Aldana C.R. Cuesta R. Hinnebush A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Tamane M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1718-1796Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and Sui1p (24Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Donahue F. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2307-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but corresponding homologues are not found in mammalian eIF3 (17Asano K. Vornlocher H.-P. Richter-Cook J.N. Merrick W.C. Hinnebush A.G. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27042-27052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the fact that the yeast factor can replace mammalian eIF3 in the methionyl-puromycin synthesis assay indicates strong conservation of function (18Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the accurate definition of the subunit composition of yeast eIF3 and the description of subunit functions should also help to improve our understanding of mammalian eIF3 functions in the initiation of translation. The essential S. cerevisiae gene RPG1 encoding a polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa has been described as being required for passage through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Elutriated cells of the temperature-sensitive rpg1–1 mutant arrested in the early G1 phase of the first cell cycle and ceased cell growth when shifted to restrictive conditions (25Kovarik P. Hašek J. Valášek L. Ruis H. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Rpg1p amino acid sequence is 29% identical to that of p180. Here we report thatS. cerevisiae Rpg1p is the functional homologue of the mammalian p180 protein, i.e. a subunit of yeast eIF3. The following strains were used in the work reported here: W303, MATa, ade2–1, trp1–1, can1–100, leu2–3,112, his3–11,15, ura3; YLV314U, MATa, ura3::URA3::rpg1–1, rpg1-Δ2::TRP1, ade2–1, can1–100, leu2–3,112, his3–11,15 (25Kovarik P.

Strains were grown and subjected to genetic manipulations as described by Sherman et al. (27Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. A Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). To construct strain YLV314L, a SacI–PstI fragment from YCpLV14 carrying the temperature-sensitive allele rpg1–1 (25Kovarik P. Hašek J. Valášek L. Ruis H. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was inserted into the multiple cloning site of YIplac128 (28Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar) to construct plasmid YIpLV314L. This plasmid was digested with BstEII and introduced into the diploid strain YLV03 (25Kovarik P. Hašek J. Valášek L. Ruis H. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to produce the haploid strain YLV314L after sporulation and dissection of tetrads. Integration of the rpg1–1 allele into the LEU2 locus was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. To regain the ura3 selection marker, cells of strain YLV04 (25Kovarik P. Hašek J. Valášek L. Ruis H. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were grown on SC medium lacking methionine and supplemented with 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid. Following sequential streaking on four plates, a strain was obtained that retained the MET3-RPG1fusion gene, but was auxotrophic for uracil (YLV041). pRSLVPRT1-Myc is a CEN6, HIS3 plasmid that contains thePRT1-Myc gene under its endogenous promoter. This plasmid was constructed in two steps. First, a PRT1 fragment generated by (PCR) using S. cerevisiae DNA as a template was digested using SalI–SacI PCR-incorporated artificial sites (a 5′ SalI site at position −700 and a 3′SacI site immediately following the stop codon) and ligated into SalI–SacI of pRS313 (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), producing pRSLVPRT1-N, which also contained a NotI restriction site inserted by PCR immediately in front of the stop codon ofPRT1. The second step of plasmid construction consisted of an in frame insertion of a NotI-digested Myc tag into theNotI site of pRSLVPRT1-N. The resulting pRSLVPRT1-Myc was used for transformation of the haploid yeast strain W303 to generate strain YLVP10 expressing the Prt1-Myc protein. Strain P501–1C was constructed in order to test the function of the Myc-tagged PRT1 gene. A SacI–SalI fragment containing the corresponding construct derived from pRSLVPRT1-Myc was inserted into SacI–SalI restriction sites of YCplac33 (28Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar), resulting in YCpLVPRT1-Myc. The plasmid was transformed into recipient strain P501–1, producing strain P501–1C. To assemble the full-length sequence of p180, i.e. the cDNA encoding the human homologue of RPG1, a 4.75-kbMluI fragment containing the 3′ coding region ofp180 (nucleotides 564–4148) extended by 250 nucleotides of the flanking sequence was isolated from pUC19–3. The fragment was inserted into the MluI restriction site (at position 564 of the p180 nucleotide sequence) of pUC19–1 containing the 5′-end of the p180 sequence (nucleotides 1–574). The resulting plasmid carrying the full-length sequence of p180was named pUCLVp180. Both pUC19–1 and -3 plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Keith R. Johnson (University of Toledo, Toledo, OH). For the construction of YCpLV018, a 4.6-kbCelII--SnaBI fragment containing the full-lengthp180 from pUCLVp180 was blunt-ended and inserted into a blunt-ended BamHI restriction site of YCpLV00 (25Kovarik P. Hašek J. Valášek L. Ruis H. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) producing the plasmid expressing p180 under control of theRPG1 promoter. A SacI–SalI fragment of YCpLV018 was ligated into SacI–SalI restriction sites of YCplac33 (28Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar), resulting in YCpLV0318, which differs from the former plasmid merely in the selective markerURA3 instead of TRP1. YCpLV0318 was introduced into the YLV314L and YLV041 strains, resulting in strains YLV3148 and YLV418, respectively. For the construction of YCpLV718, a PCR-generated 5′-coding region ofp180 (nucleotides 1–600) using YCpLV018 as a DNA template was digested with BamHI (PCR-incorporated artificial site immediately in front of the p180 ATG) and NcoI (endogenous restriction site at position +441 of the p180nucleotide sequence). Then both a 4.2-kbNcoI–SalI fragment containing the 3′-coding region of p180 (nucleotides 441–4148) extended by 455 nucleotides of the flanking sequence and the former PCR-generated fragment were ligated into BamHI–SalI restriction sites of the 6.8-kb plasmid K2082 (provided by Dr. K. Nasmyth), yielding YCpLV718, which expresses p180 under control of the GAL1 promoter. The plasmid was introduced into strains YLV314L and YLV041 yielding strains YLV3148g and YLV418g, respectively. Quantitative mating assays were performed as follows. The cells were grown overnight at room temperature to mid-log phase, washed once with sterile water, and resuspended in YPD medium (pH 4.7). Cells (107) of both wild-type and rpg1–1 mutant strains were mixed with an equal number of cells of mating tester strains JJ-1A or JJ-1C; and mixtures were brought to a final volume of 1 ml; and cells were gently propagated for 4 h at either permissive or restrictive temperature. Cells (104) from mating samples were then plated onto minimal media without amino acids to select for diploids and were incubated for 2 days. Subsequently, the plates were scored for single colonies. To determine the ability of the rpg1–1 mutant to respond to α-factor at the restrictive temperature, cultures of wild-type andrpg1–1 mutant cells were grown to anA600 of 0.4 at room temperature and resuspended in prewarmed 25 or 37 °C medium supplemented with α-pheromone (60 μg/ml). After 2 h, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and scored for shmoo formation by microscopic observation. These were performed as described previously (30Koller H.T. Klade T. Ellinger A. Breitenbach M. Yeast. 1996; 12: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, mutant cells of strain YLV314U were pregrown to mid-log phase in SC medium containing a reduced amount (25 mg/liter) of leucine (SC+ rLEU). The prewarmed (37 °C) and room temperature (25 °C) SC+ rLEU media were inoculated to a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml and incubated at the permissive or restrictive temperature for 24 h. Then cells from both incubations were split into two parts. Cells from one part were resuspended at a density of 5 × 107cells/ml in 5 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) SC+ rLEU plus 10 μCi of [3H]leucine medium (hereafter called SC+[3H]LEU) and assayed for incorporation of the labeled amino acid at 37 °C. The second sample was manipulated similarly but resuspended in 25 °C SC+[3H]LEU medium and assayed at 25 °C. In the other set of experiments, YLV314U cells were propagated overnight in SC+ rLEU medium at room temperature, resuspended in SC+[3H]LEU medium, and, after 2 h of incubation at 25 °C, shifted to restrictive temperature and assayed. After incubation, samples were processed as follows. 10 μg/ml of cycloheximide was added to each sample; then cells were isolated by centrifugation, washed once with TE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), mixed with 600 μl of glass beads (0.45–0.50-mm diameter), brought to a final volume of 1 ml of TE buffer, and homogenized in a Braun homogenizer. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g, aliquots of clear supernatant were counted in a Packard scintillation counter. Radioactivity incorporated into protein was determined after applying equal aliquots onto Whatman DE81 filters, drying, incubating for 5 min in 20% trichloroacetic acid, and boiling for 5 min. Samples were counted in a scintillation counter using Ecolume (ICN) scintillation mixture after washing them twice with 20% trichloroacetic acid, washing once with 95% EtOH, washing once with pure acetone, and drying. eIF3 was prepared fromS. cerevisiae strain ABYS essentially as described previously (26Danaie P. Wittmer B. Altmann M. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4288-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Samples containing eIF3, crude cell extracts, or immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar) using the Mini Protean system (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted to nitrocellulose (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 80: 4350-4354Crossref Scopus (44935) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of proteins was carried out using either polyclonal (25Kovarik P. Hašek J. Valášek L. Ruis H. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or monoclonal (33Jiřincová J. Vavřičková P. Paleček J. Hašek J. Folia Biologica. 1998; 44: 73PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies directed against Rpg1p and either polyclonal rat anti-Prt1p antibody (26Danaie P. Wittmer B. Altmann M. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4288-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or anti-Myc hybridoma supernatant antibody. As a secondary antibody, anti-rabbit, anti-rat, or anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase or with horseradish peroxidase, respectively, were used. Proteins were visualized either by using alkaline phosphatase substrates (nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate) in AP buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5) or as described in the ECL manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The preparation of crude cell extracts used is described below. For maximum sensitivity, the gels were stained using a silver staining protocol (34Merril C.R. Nature. 1990; 227: 1779-1780Google Scholar). The extract from human cells was prepared as follows. U937 promonocytes were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal serum and lysed in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.05), 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaPPi, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 3 μg/ml aprotinin. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 4,000 × g at 4 °C for 8 min. The following yeast strains were used for the preparation of cell-free translation systems: P501–1, YLV314L, and W303. Preparation of the extracts, cell-free translation, and the preparation of total yeast RNA were performed as described previously (35Altmann M. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6085-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Altmann M. Trachsel H. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 11: 343-352Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To analyze polysome profiles, strains W303 and YLV314L were cultured overnight in YPD at room temperature to an A600 of 0.8. Samples of 20 ml were centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min and resuspended in an equal volume of YPD either kept at room temperature or prewarmed to 37 °C, after which the samples were incubated for 1 h at the temperatures indicated. Just 5 min before harvesting, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to the cultures, followed by quick cooling. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and homogenized by shaking with a Vortex mixer using glass beads. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4000 ×g for 2 min at 4 °C. Samples of 2A260 units of whole extracts were fractionated on linear 5–40% sucrose gradients for 40 min at 260,000 ×g. Fractionation of polysomes was done by upward displacement while scanning at 260 nm with an ISCO detector. Crude extracts were prepared as described previously (25Kovarik P. Hašek J. Valášek L.

Antibodies were preincubated for 2 h with 50 μl of GammaBind-G Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer A, except in the case of the monoclonal anti-Rpg1p antibody, which was directly incubated with samples. Samples containing 5 mg of total protein in a final volume of 100 μl were incubated for 1 h with 30 μl of 1:1 slurry of GammaBind-G Sepharose beads in buffer A. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation and discarded to remove antigens that bound nonspecifically to G-protein-Sepharose. The remaining supernatants were mixed either with 50 μl of beads already preincubated with anti-Myc antibody or with monoclonal anti-Rpg1p antibody for 2 h. Subsequently, 50 μl of fresh beads in buffer A were added. All samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating mixer. Samples were centrifuged briefly, and the supernatants were removed. The beads were washed five times with 400 μl of buffer A and were then mixed with 50 μl of SDS buffer, heated for 2 min at 95 °C, and spun down. The supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. Equivalent portions of the supernatants and the pellet fractions were analyzed to estimate the fraction of the proteins bound in immune complexes. We demonstrated recently that the S. cerevisiae essential gene RPG1 is required for the passage through the G1 phase (25Kovarik P. Hašek J. Valášek L. Ruis H. Curr.

There are three points in the yeast cell cycle where the further progression depends on active protein synthesis, of which the G1 phase is the most important (37Burke D.J. Church D. Mol. Cell.

When it appeared to us that the RPG1 gene product could be a homologue of the mammalian p180 (6Johnston K.J. Merrick W.C. Zoll W.L. Zhu Y. J. Biol.

As shown in TableI, the mating efficiency of therpg1–1 ts mutant is strikingly diminished (5-fold) even at the permissive temperature compared with wild-type cells.

Here, we show that the type II receptor (TβR-II) gene is activated at the transcriptional level when EC cells differentiate. We show that the differentiated cells, but not the parental EC cells, express transcripts for TβR-II. In addition, the expression of TβR-II promoter/reporter gene constructs are elevated dramatically when EC cells differentiate and we identify at least two positive and two negative regulatory regions in the 5′ flanking region of the TβR-II gene. Moreover, we identify a cAMP response element/activating transcription factor site that acts as a positive cis-regulatory element in the TβR-IIpromoter, and we demonstrate that the transcription factor ATF-1 binds to this site and strongly stimulates the expression of theTβR-II promoter/reporter gene constructs when ATF-1 is overexpressed in EC-derived differentiated cells. Equally important, we identify a negative regulatory element in a 53-base pair region that had previously been shown to inhibit strongly the expression ofTβR-II promoter/reporter gene constructs. Specifically, we demonstrate that this region, which contains an inverted CCAAT box motif, binds the transcription factor complex NF-Y (also referred to as CBF) in vitro. Furthermore, expression of a dominant-negative NF-YA mutant protein, which prevents DNA binding by NF-Y, enhances TβR-II promoter expression. Together, these studies suggest that the transcription factors ATF-1 and NF-Y play important roles in the regulation of the TβR-IIgene.

Based on these activities and the defined spatial and temporal pattern of expression of the three mammalian isoforms of TGF-β (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3) during mouse embryogenesis, it has been argued that the TGF-βs play important roles in the generation and modification of extracellular signals that direct critical processes during mammalian development (5Rizzino A.

TGF-βs primarily exert their biological effects through interactions with three distinct high affinity TGF-β cell surface receptors (designated types I, II, and III). All three receptors have been cloned and characterized (28Wang X. Lin H. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H. Weinberg R.

Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Both the type I (TβR-I) and type II (TβR-II) receptors are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases that act in concert to mediate intracellular signaling. The type III (TβR-III) receptor (also referred to as betaglycan) is a transmembrane proteoglycan devoid of intrinsic signaling ability, but which may act to present ligand to other signaling receptors (34Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The most commonly held model for the activation of the TGF-β signal transduction cascade proposes the selective binding of TGF-β to the type II receptor, a constitutively active kinase (35Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to TβR-II induces recruitment of TβR-I into a stable complex. Once this complex is formed, TβR-II transphosphorylates TβR-I at serine and threonine residues, resulting in signal transduction to downstream substrates. Thus, loss of responsiveness to TGF-β could result from changes in the expression of functional TGF-β receptors rather than defects in the expression or activation of TGF-β ligand. Efforts to define the roles of TGF-β and their receptors have involved the study of embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, as they are a model system used frequently for studying early mammalian development (36Rizzino A. Growth Factors in Mammalian Development. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989Google Scholar). EC cells resemble cells of the early mouse embryo morphologically and biochemically. Moreover, they can be induced to differentiate into many of the cell types formed during mammalian embryogenesis (37Martin G.R. Science. 1980; 209: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), making them particularly well suited for the investigation of the signal transduction events involved in cellular differentiation. Furthermore, they provide a useful tool for the identification of mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis, as EC cells are tumorigenic whereas their differentiated cells are largely non-tumorigenic. Using this model system, we demonstrated that EC cells do not express detectable cell surface receptors for TGF-β until after they are induced to differentiate (38Rizzino A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4386-4390PubMed Google Scholar). Equally important, the up-regulation in the expression of TGF-β receptors by the EC-derived differentiated cells coincides with the ability of exogenous TGF-β to inhibit their proliferation as well as to their loss of tumorigenic potential (38Rizzino A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4386-4390PubMed Google Scholar,39Kelly D. Rizzino A. Differentiation. 1989; 41: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the expression of theTβR-II gene both in F9 EC cells and their differentiated counterparts. Our findings demonstrate that few, if any,TβR-II transcripts are expressed by F9 EC cells, whereas there is a dramatic increase in the expression of TβR-IImRNA when F9 EC cells are induced to differentiate. This observation is supported by the differences in expression of variousTβR-II promoter/reporter gene constructs in EC cells and their differentiated counterparts, arguing strongly that the large increase in the steady-state levels of TβR-II mRNA that accompany differentiation is due, at least in part, to an increase in the transcription of the TβR-II gene promoter. In addition, our results identify both positive and negative regulatory regions in the TβR-II promoter that appear to contribute significantly to the transcriptional activity of theTβR-II gene in both EC and EC-derived differentiated cells. In this regard, mutation of a CRE/ATF motif (−196 to −185) within one of the positive regulatory regions reduces substantiallyTβR-II promoter activity in the EC-derived differentiated cells. Gel mobility shift analyses demonstrates that the transcription factor ATF-1 is able to bind to this CRE/ATF motif in vitro. We demonstrate further that expression of ATF-1 in vivoup-regulates TβR-II promoter activity in the differentiated cells, most likely through the CRE/ATF motif. Conversely, we have identified an inverted CCAAT box motif (−83 to −74) that appears to negatively influence the transcriptional activity of the TβR-II promoter in both EC cells and their differentiated counterparts. The TβR-II CCAAT box motif is bound in vitro by the transcription factor complex, NF-Y (also referred to as CBF) in both cell types. Importantly, we demonstrate that expression of a dominant-negative NF-YA mutant protein, which prevents DNA binding of the NF-Y transcription factor complex, specifically enhances the expression of TβR-IIpromoter/reporter gene constructs in both F9 EC cells and their differentiated cells. Together, these studies suggest that ATF-1 and NF-Y play important roles in the regulation of the TβR-IIgene. Stock cultures of mouse F9 EC, mouse PYS-2 and mouse PSA-5E cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen Company, Purchase, NY) as reported previously (40Rizzino A. Crowley C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 41Rizzino A. Orme L.S. DeLarco J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 143: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Differentiation of F9 EC cells was induced by treatment with 5 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (RA, Eastman Kodak Co.). Stock cultures and all experimental cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a moist atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from nearly confluent cultures of F9 EC cells and F9-differentiated cells by the Invitrogen FastTrack 2.0 Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). F9-differentiated cells were derived from F9 EC cells treated with 5 μm RA for 5 days. For Northern blotting, 3 μg mRNA samples from each cell type were denatured in 1× MOPS running buffer (40 mm MOPS, pH 7, 10 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA), 2.2 m formaldehyde, and 50% formamide at 65 °C for 15 min and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 1× MOPS running buffer in 0.22 mformaldehyde. After electrophoresis, the fractionated mRNA was transferred to an MSI nylon membrane (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) in 10× SSPE (1.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Following transfer, the membrane was baked at 80 °C for 2 h. Filters were prehybridized for 3 h at 42 °C in a solution consisting of 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% deionized formamide, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon testis DNA. Hybridization was performed in the same buffer with 2 × 106 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled probe for 16–18 h at 42 °C. The 32P-labeled probe was obtained bySacI digestion of the human TβR-II cDNA clone, H2–3FF (30Lin H.Y. Wang X.F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). The approximately 1.5-kilobase pair fragment was radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]dCTP using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) to a specific activity of 1–2 × 109 cpm/μg. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed twice in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature followed by a single wash in 0.5× SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 50 °C. Filters were autoradiographed at −80 °C with Kodak X-Omat AR film. All prehybridization, hybridization and wash conditions were the same for hybridizations with the hGAPDH normalization probe. The 780-base pair probe was obtained by PstI and XbaI digestion of the plasmid clone, HcGAP (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and radioactively labeled as described above. TβR-IIpromoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene expression plasmids were generated and amplified by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA containing the 5′-untranslated region of the human TβR-II gene as a template and cloned into pGEM4-SVOCAT (42Bae H.W.

All plasmids were verified by sequencing, and purified by Qiagen tip-500 columns. F9 EC cells, F9-differentiated cells (day 3), PYS-2 cells, and PSA-5E cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (49Ma Y-G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P. Tiesman J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Develop. Biol. 1992; 154: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Typically, 20 μg of each TβR-II promoter/CATplasmid was co-transfected with 2 μg of the internal standard, pCMV-β. After an overnight incubation with the DNA-CaPO4 precipitate, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CAT activities were determined 48 h after transfection by the method of Seed and Sheen (50Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene. 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity by the method of Rosenthal (51Rosenthal N.

In some experiments, 10 μg of pTβRII-n constructs were co-transfected with optimal concentrations of the expression plasmids containing human ATF-1 or ATF-2cDNAs or the dominant negative mutant, NFYA29. Nuclear extracts from F9 EC and F9-differentiated (day 5) cells were prepared as described previously (53Kelly D. Scholtz B. Orten D. Hinrichs S.H. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod.

Nuclear extracts were prepared in the presence of the following protease inhibitors: pepstatin A, antipain, chymostatin, and leupeptin (all at 1 μg/ml), PMSF (1 mm), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 μg/ml), benzamidine (2.5 mm), and aprotinin (2.5 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml). Nuclear extracts also contained protein phosphatase inhibitors: (NH4)2MoO4 (1 mm) and NaF (5 mm). Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce Micro BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce).

For gel mobility supershift analyses with the wild-typeTβR-II −210 to −185 probe, the binding reactions were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of the antibodies indicated, prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The ATF-1 specific monoclonal antibody was generated against recombinant ATF-1 and reacts only with complexes containing ATF-1. This antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Steven Hinrichs (University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha NE).

To identify possible mechanisms for the significant increase in TGF-β ligand binding and growth responsiveness that is observed when EC cells are induced to differentiate (38Rizzino A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4386-4390PubMed Google Scholar), we initially examined mRNA expression of the TβR-II gene in F9 EC cells and their differentiated counterparts. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from undifferentiated F9 EC cells detected little or no transcript of approximately 5.2 kilobases that corresponds to the size predicted for the TβR-II gene (Fig.1)(30). However, the intensity of this transcript increased substantially (>15-fold) after F9 EC cells were induced to differentiate with RA (Fig. 1). Thus, it appears that there is a strong correlation between the expression of TβR-IImRNA in F9 EC cells and F9-differentiated cells and the ability of each cell type to bind and respond to TGF-β. Due to the large increase in the steady-state levels of TβR-IImRNA when F9 EC cells are induced to differentiate, we examined the transcriptional activity of the TβR-II gene promoter in F9 EC cells and their differentiated counterparts. These studies employed chimeric gene constructs in which various amounts of the 5′-flanking region of the human TβR-II gene were inserted upstream of the CAT reporter gene in the plasmid pGEM-SVOCAT (42Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of HepG2 cells with these constructs had previously identified several distinct regulatory regions in theTβR-II promoter including: two positive regulatory regions (−219 to −172 and +1 to +35), two negative regulatory regions (−1240 to −504 and −100 to −67), and the core promoter region (−47 to −1)(42).

While a cytosolic GrpE-like protein has recently been identified, the demonstration of both a microsomal and a second mitochondrial GrpE-like member represents the first in any biological system. Investigation of the microsomal and two mitochondrial GrpE-like proteins revealed that they bound specifically to Escherichia coli DnaK, and the complexes formed were not disrupted in the presence of 0.5m salt but were readily dissociated in the presence of 5 mm ATP. The functional integrity of mt-GrpE#1 and #2 was verified by their ability to specifically interact with and stimulate the ATPase activity of mammalian mitochondrial Hsp70 (mt-Hsp70). Analysis of the cDNA sequences encoding the two mammalian mitochondrial GrpE-like proteins revealed ∼47% positional identity at the amino acid level, the presence of a highly conserved mitochondrial leader sequence, and putative destabilization elements within the 3′-untranslated region of the mt-GrpE#2 transcript which are not present in the mt-GrpE#1 transcript. A constitutive expression of both mitochondrial GrpE-like transcripts in 22 distinct mouse tissues was observed but possible different post-transcriptional regulation of the mt-GrpE#1 and #2 transcripts may confer a different expression pattern of the encoded proteins.

Cytol. 1997; 174: 127-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the Hsp70 family have been found in all organisms examined, and representatives from distantly related organisms often display a high degree of sequence similarity. For example, at the amino acid level the prokaryotic Escherichia coli Hsp70 member (DnaK) exhibits ∼51% positional identity with its higher eukaryotic mitochondrial homologue (mt-Hsp70) (7Webster T.J. Naylor D.J. Hartman D.J. Høj P.B. Hoogenraad N.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Central to the function of Hsp70 members as molecular chaperones is a weak ATPase activity which, at least in the case of E. coli DnaK, is synergistically stimulated up to 50-fold by the heat shock proteins DnaJ and GrpE (8Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). DnaJ and GrpE appear to regulate the ability of DnaK to bind and stabilize unfolded proteins before their release in a reaction requiring ATP hydrolysis (9Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). It has been shown that DnaJ stimulates the hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP which allows DnaK (in the ADP-bound state) to interact more strongly with unfolded proteins. GrpE then acts as a “nucleotide exchange factor” to recycle DnaK into an ATP-bound state, thereby permitting the efficient release of substrate. Recently, the crystal structure of E. coli GrpE bound to the ATPase domain of DnaK was determined (10Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This confirmed earlier studies that a dimer of GrpE binds asymmetrically to a single DnaK molecule in the absence of ATP (11Osipiuk J. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4821-4827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4806-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GrpE is proposed to facilitate release of DnaK-bound ADP by essentially wedging apart the DnaK ATPase domain, thus weakening the grasp of DnaK on ADP. Furthermore, a long α-helical region of GrpE is believed to extend to the C-terminal substrate binding domain of DnaK where it could possibly mediate an interdomain communication necessary for substrate release. Thus, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE appear to function in a mechanistic fashion as a molecular “chaperone team” which, in one form or an other, may operate in all compartments of eukaryotic cells. 70 kDa heat shock protein equilibration buffer endoplasmic reticulum Hsp70/Hsc70-associating protein the constitutive isoform of Hsp70 immobilized metal affinity chromatography mitochondrial expressed sequence tag polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine base pair(s). Homologues of DnaK and DnaJ have been identified in several major compartments of the eukaryotic cell, including the cytosol, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and chloroplasts, and in many cases these chaperones exist in multiple isoforms (reviewed in Refs.1Gething M.-J.

Biol. 1997; 33: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but in no case have isoforms been detected. While a chloroplast GrpE-like protein has been inferred through cross-reactivity with antibodies to E. coli GrpE (19Schlicher T. Soll J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), mitochondrial GrpE homologues fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (Mge1p, Yge1p, GrpEp, and mGrpE),Drosophila melanogaster (Droe1p), and mammals (mt-GrpE#1) were identified by their abilities to bind specifically to Hsp70 members, and the complexes formed are not disrupted in the presence of 1 m salt but readily dissociate in the presence of 5 mm ATP (15Bolliger L. Deloche O. Glick B.S. Georgopoulos C. Jenö P. Kronidou N. Horst M. Morishima N. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1998-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Naylor D.J. Ryan M.T. Condron R.

Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein-Folding Catalysts. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 141-142Google Scholar). Such a specific interaction was first observed between the E. coli members of GrpE and DnaK (20Zylicz M. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is somewhat surprising then that the role of a GrpE-like protein may not be required for the proper functioning of Hsp70 homologues outside mitochondria and chloroplasts while DnaJ homologues exist in all additional compartments that contain Hsp70 members. Indeed, it is perhaps more likely that the three-component chaperone team of Hsp70, DnaJ, and GrpE is conserved in numerous compartments of eukaryotic cells, but that sequence similarities have been too low to allow facile identification through comprehensive searches of data bases (21Naylor D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Høj P.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, as opposed to members of the Hsp70 (DnaK), Hsp60 (GroEL), and Hsp10 (GroES) families from rat mitochondria and E. coli which exhibit 51, 49, and 45% positional identity at the amino acid level, respectively, the GrpE family exhibits only 21% positional identity, and comparison of 20 GrpE sequences identified only six invariant residues (21Naylor D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Høj P.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Another likely reason for the paucity of identified GrpE-like proteins is their very low abundance in most systems (i.e. Mge1p and mt-GrpE#1 comprise ∼0.03% of the total soluble mitochondrial proteins) (21Naylor D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Høj P.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Nakai M. Kato Y. Ikeda E. Toh-e A. Endo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Taken together, the low degree of sequence similarities and the low abundance of at least some GrpE members calls for both a sequence based and a functional approach to search for new GrpE-like chaperones. Indeed, very recently a cytosolic/nuclear located Hsp70/Hsc70-associating protein (Hap) (alternatively named BAG-1 or RAP46) with GrpE-like activity but a seemingly unrelated primary structure has been reported (23Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 25Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Alternative translation initiation from a single Hap transcript in both human and mouse cells is believed to generate either a cytosolic ∼36- and ∼32-kDa Hap protein, respectively, or a ∼50-kDa Hap protein with an N-terminal extension thought to be important in nuclear targeting (26Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The finding of a cytosolic/nuclear-located protein with GrpE-like activity lends further support to the supposition that Hsp70 members operate as components of DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE-like chaperone teams irrespective of the organism or cellular location. Given the presence in the endoplasmic reticulum of both DnaJ-like members (Sec63 and Scj1p) and Hsp70-like homologues (BiP and Lhs1p), it is therefore not unlikely that microsomal proteins with GrpE-like activity exist (reviewed in Refs. 1Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 2Martinus R.D. Ryan M.T. Naylor D.J. Herd S.M. Hoogenraad N.J. Høj P.B.

Cytol. 1997; 174: 127-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have now further explored the complexity of the mammalian GrpE complement. We provide evidence that mammalian cells, in addition to their previously identified mt-GrpE#1 and cytosolic/nuclear located Hap members, contain a second distinct mitochondrial GrpE member (mt-GrpE#2) which functions as a co-chaperone for mt-Hsp70, plus a microsomal ∼50-kDa protein which may serve as a partner for ER BiP or an as yet unidentified Hsp70 member. Preparation of a DnaK-affinity column and subsequent chromatography was described previously (17Naylor D.J. Ryan M.T. Condron R. Hoogenraad N.J. Høj P.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Isolation of bovine liver organelles was performed on sucrose density gradients by removing a broad region of the gradient where mitochondria predominantly reside with significant amounts of endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes being present. 2D. J. Naylor, N. J. Hoogenraad, and P. B. Høj, manuscript in preparation. Soluble protein extracts were then prepared from the purified organelles. Following DnaK affinity chromatography, 100 μg of the 5 mm ATP eluate (predominantly comprised of bovine mt-GrpE#1) was mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Life Technologies, Inc.) and injected subcutaneously into a 7-month-old New Zealand White rabbit. The rabbit was boosted, three times at 6-week intervals, with approximately 50 μg of bovine mt-GrpE#1 excised from SDS-PAGE gels, developed into a slurry, and mixed with an equal volume of Freund's incomplete adjuvant as described by Harlow and Lane (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Ear bleeds were performed 10 days after the third boost, and serum containing polyclonal antibodies to mt-GrpE#1 was collected and processed (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The serum was supplemented with 0.02% (v/v) sodium azide and stored at −70 °C. Dilutions of 1 in 10,000 were used in immunostaining analysis. For Western blotting, cellular protein fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 16% (w/v) Tris-Tricine gel (29Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose using a semidry transfer unit (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

The blot was probed with the rabbit antiserum and HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, followed by incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subsequent exposure to Hyperfilm™-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mitochondria (bovine liver) were prepared according to Hartman et al. (30Hartman D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Condron R. Høj P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The growth of rat hepatoma (H4) cells in the presence of the amino acid analoguel-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, the conditions for heat shock, and the isolation of 35S-labeled cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins were as described previously (21Naylor D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Høj P.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A crude cellular lysate was prepared by hypotonic lysis and Dounce homogenization. Cellular membranes and nuclei were removed as a pellet following a 754 × g centrifugation, and a crude mitochondrial pellet was obtained by recentrifugation of the supernatant at 10,000 × g. The remaining supernatant represented the cytosolic and microsomal fraction. Mitochondria were purified further on sucrose gradients and following incubation with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 reduced (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h, a soluble mitochondrial lysate was obtained after centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 1 h. The verified nucleotide sequence encoding mouse mt-GrpE#2 was obtained by sequence analysis of two independently isolated expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the I.M.A.G.E.

AA060861and AA049605, respectively; see “Results” and “Discussion”) (31Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Both strands of the two clones were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure of Sanger et al. (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar). Rat genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme (40 units at 37 °C for 8 h) and electrophoresed in a Tris acetate-EDTA (TAE)-buffered 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel. The digested DNA was transferred onto a Hybond™-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the blot was prehybridized for 6 h at 65 °C in 5× SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1%(w/v) Ficoll™ 400, 0.1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). The membrane was probed with a32P-labeled mouse mt-GrpE#2 cDNA fragment (nucleotides 65–690, Fig. 1), then stripped by incubation in 0.5% (w/v) SDS at ∼90 °C for 10 min and reprobed with a 32P-labeled rat mt-GrpE#1 cDNA fragment (GenBankTM accession no.U62940, nucleotides 96–733). The denatured probes were added to the prehybridization solution and hybridizations were carried out for 12 h at 65 °C. Final washes were performed for 10 min at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and the blots were analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager and Image QuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). The cDNA coding regions specifying the mature translation products of mouse mt-GrpE#2 (579 bp), rat mt-GrpE#1 (570 bp), and rat mt-Hsp70 (1899 bp, GenBankTM accession no.S75280) were amplified with VentR®DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) utilizing specific primer pairs in a 30-cycle polymerase chain reaction protocol (94 °C for 60 s, 55 °C for 90 s, and 72 °C for 90 s). The primer pairs used were: for mouse mt-GrpE#2 (5′-GTTAACATATGAGCACTGCCACCCAAAGAACT-3′ + 5′-AGCCGGATCCTTAGAGTCTTCTCTGAGACTCTAC-3′), for rat mt-GrpE#1 (5′-CCATTGGGATCCTAAGGAGGTTAACATATGTGCACAGCTACAAAACAAAAG-3′ + 5′-CGGAATTCAAGCTTGGATCCTTAAGCGTCCTTCACCACCCCCAC-3′), and for rat mt-Hsp70 (5′-ATGGATCCATATGGCGTCAGAAGCAATCAAGGGTGC-3′ + 5′-TTGGATCCTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGAGAACCCCGCGGAACTAA-3′). PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI, then ligated individually into the same predigested sites of the pET-14b vector (for mt-GrpE#1 + #2) or pET-3a vector (for mt-Hsp70) as specified in the manufacturer's manual (4th Ed., Novagen). Note that the mt-Hsp70 construct was designed to remove a preexisting N-terminal T7-Tag™ and introduce a C-terminal hexahistidine tag preceded by a thrombin cleavage site. Constructs under the selection of ampicillin were then separately transformed into BL21(DE3) cells co-harboring the pLysS plasmid under the selection of chloramphenicol (Novagen). The authenticity of each construct was verified by sequence analysis of ∼300 bp from either end of each cDNA insert within the pET-14b or pET-3a vectors. For expression of the recombinant mt-GrpE#1 and #2 proteins bearing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (removable with thrombin), typically 1.5 liters of Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 40 μg/ml chloramphenicol were inoculated with the transformants and shaken at 30 °C until the A600 nm was equal to 0.5. Synthesis of the recombinant protein was initiated by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and incubation was continued at 30 °C for 3 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed by the lysozyme method according to Sambrook et al. (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 17.38Google Scholar). After centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min) the supernatant was applied at 4 °C to a 2-ml Talon™ metal affinity column (CLONTECH) equilibrated in 25 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 10 mmβ-mecaptoethanol. Following extensive washing with equilibration buffer (EB), the column was washed successively with 0.3 mNaCl in EB (i.e. 0.5 m NaCl final concentration), 10 mm imidazole in EB, 5 mmATP, 10 mm MgCl, and 50 mm KCl in EB, 2.5 mm CaCl2 in EB. Finally an essentially pure preparation of recombinant protein (∼40 mg for mt-GrpE#1 and ∼14 mg for mt-GrpE#2) was recovered by recirculating through the column a 20-ml solution of EB fortified with 2.5 mmCaCl2 and 10 units of human thrombin (Boehringer Mannheim) for 5 h. Uncleaved recombinant protein retained on the IMAC columns was eluted with 100 mm imidazole in EB (∼20 mg for mt-GrpE#1 and ∼7 mg for mt-GrpE#2) and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex-200 (26/60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in 0.1 m NaPi (pH 7.3) and 100 mm NaCl at 4 °C. The masses of hexahistidine-tagged recombinant mt-GrpE#1 + #2 were determined on an electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE SCIEX API300) essentially as described by Hartman et al. (30Hartman D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Condron R. Høj P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3394-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A proteolytic fragment of recombinant mouse mt-GrpE#2 was subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 12.5% Tris-glycine gel (34Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), recovered with a gel-spin protein recovery kit (ScimaR), then taken for direct N-terminal protein sequencing as described previously (30Hartman D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Condron R. Høj P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3394-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Expression and subsequent purification of the recombinant mt-Hsp70 protein was carried out as described for mt-GrpE#1 and #2 except expression was performed for 16 h at 16 °C (instead of 30 °C). Typically ∼10 mg of soluble mt-Hsp70 were purified from 1 liter of culture. Nondenaturing PAGE was performed in 6% Tris-glycine gels by omitting SDS from the PAGE system (34Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The protein samples were prepared in 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl,10 mm MgCl, 10 mm β-mecaptoethanol, and 50 units/ml apyrase and incubated at 4 °C for 6 h prior to electrophoresis at 30 mA for 12 h at 4 °C. Rat liver mt-Hsp70, mouse RIF-1 cell Hsc70, and pig liver BiP were purified by ATP-agarose chromatography (C-8 attachment, Sigma), from mitochondrial, cytosolic and microsomal soluble protein extracts (21Naylor D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Høj P.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), essentially as described by Webster et al. (7Webster T.J. Naylor D.J. Hartman D.J. Høj P.B. Hoogenraad N.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of recombinant rat mt-Hsp70 was measured by the conversion of [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi; 4000 Ci/mmol, Bresatec) to γ-32Piessentially as described previously (8Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 40 μm ATP, and the appropriate proteins. Reactions were terminated by spotting 2-μl samples onto Polygram CEL 300 polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Macherey-Nagel) where [γ-32P]ATP was separated from γ-32Pi by one-dimensional chromatography using a solution of 1 m formic acid and 1 mLiCl. Hydrolyzed ATP was then quantified by Storm PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). The E. coli DnaJ protein was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. while the recombinant rat mt-Hsp70, rat mt-GrpE#1 and mouse mt-GrpE#2 proteins were prepared without their hexahistine tags as described earlier. For identification of the tissue distribution of the mt-GrpE transcripts, an RNA dot blot with mRNA from 22 different mouse tissues (100–500 ng each) was purchased fromCLONTECH (catalog no. 7771–1) and prehybridized, hybridized, and analyzed as described for the Southern blot analysis above. It has previously been established thatE. coli GrpE binds strongly to immobilized DnaK in the absence of ATP (20Zylicz M. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing this specific interaction we previously reported the DnaK-affinity purification of a single mitochondrial GrpE homologue (mt-GrpE#1) from rat, porcine, and bovine liver mitochondrial extracts (17Naylor D.J. Ryan M.T. Condron R. Hoogenraad N.J. Høj P.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the present work we again employed DnaK-affinity chromatography, combined with an antiserum to mt-GrpE#1, to identify additional GrpE-like members from a bovine liver organellar extract. Although SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein constituents, that were specifically retained on immobilized DnaK in presence of 1m KCl but were readily dissociated from DnaK in the presence of 5 mm ATP, revealed only the mt-GrpE#1 protein following staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, at least one other related protein appears to be contained in this eluate. Fig.1 A shows the Western blotting pattern observed when the mt-GrpE#1 antiserum was used to probe the protein constituents from the 5 mm ATP eluate (of the DnaK column) and several purified organellar preparations. As suspected, the antiserum detected predominantly mt-GrpE#1 in the 5 mm ATP eluate (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) which co-migrated with a single species in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 1 A,lane 1). The detection of a small amount of a slightly lower molecular weight species was previously determined to be a proteolytic breakdown product of the mt-GrpE#1 protein (Fig. 1 A,lane 2) (17Naylor D.J. Ryan M.T. Condron R. Hoogenraad N.J. Høj P.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The antiserum which was prepared by initial immunization with greater than 95% pure mt-GrpE#1 and three subsequent boosts with gel-purified mt-GrpE#1 also detected a minor amount of a ∼50-kDa protein in the 5 mm eluate of the DnaK column (Fig. 1 A,lane 2) which co-migrated with a single species in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). This observation represents the first evidence for a GrpE-like protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Although there is a formal possibility that the antibodies which recognize the ∼50-kDa protein were in fact produced against it and therefore do not identify mt-GrpE#1, it should be noted that the ∼50-kDa protein forms a stable interaction with immobilized DnaK that cannot be disrupted in the"
https://openalex.org/W1975825980,"We have investigated the role of sequences that surround the primer binding site (PBS) in the reverse transcriptase-mediated initiation of (−) strand DNA synthesis in human immunodeficiency virus type 1. In comparisons of reverse transcription initiated from either the cognate primer tRNALys.3 or a DNA primerd-Lys.3, bound to PBS sequences, we observed that a +3 pausing site occurred in both circumstances. However, the initiation reaction with tRNALys.3 was also characterized by a pausing event after incorporation of the first nucleotide. Alteration of sequences at the 5′-end instead of the 3′-end of the PBS resulted in elimination of the +3 pausing site, suggesting that this site was template sequence-dependent. In contrast, the pausing event at the +1 nucleotide position was still present in experiments that employed either of these mutated RNA templates. The mutations at the 5′-end of the PBS also caused a severely diminished rate of initiation and the strong arrest of reactions at the +1 stage when tRNALys.3 was used as primer. Therefore, we propose that the +1 pausing event is an initiation-specific event in regard to reactions primed by tRNALys.3 and that sequences at the 5′-end of the PBS may facilitate the release of reverse transcription from initiation to elongation.

In HIV-1, this includes a stretch of four nucleotides,i.e. 622AAAA625 (the A-rich loop) that interacts directly with positions 33USUU36of the anticodon loop of primer tRNALys.3. This A-rich loop is important for initiation of (−) strand DNA synthesis and generation of progeny virus (17Liang C. Li X.G. Rong L.W. Inouye P. Quan Y.D. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. J.

In HIV-1, the initiation stage of synthesis of (−) strand DNA, primed by tRNALys.3, can be distinguished from subsequent strand elongation in regard to both the binding and kinetic properties of reverse transcriptase (RT) (18Isel C.

These reports showed that initiation was characterized by both early short (−) strand DNA products, resulting from pausing at the +3 or +5 nt positions, and rapid dissociation of RT from the initiation complex. The secondary structure formed between tRNALys.3 and the viral RNA template may play an important role in initiation of reverse transcription. To pursue this subject, we developed an in vitro reverse transcription system in which low concentrations of dNTPs (i.e. 160 nm) were used to enhance our ability to detect very early pause sites, e.g. +1 and +3, in reactions primed with the tRNALys.3 cognate primer. To study the roles of sequences flanking the PBS, we generated a series of mutated HIV-1 RNA templates that contained mutations at both the 5′- and 3′-ends of the PBS that may potentially disrupt the secondary structure of complexes of tRNALys.3 and viral RNA template. Our data provide the first evidence for a +1 pausing event in reverse transcription initiated from primer tRNALys.3. We have also demonstrated on the basis of mutagenesis studies that the +3 pausing site depends on the nature of sequences at the 5′-end of the PBS and that deletion of an A-rich loop in this region or of substitutions at the 5′-end of the PBS may make it difficult for primer tRNALys.3 to be extended beyond the +1 pausing site. DNA sequences at nt positions 473–1417 of HIV-1 (HxB2D) were cloned into the RNA expression vector pSP72 (Promega, Madison, WI) through use of BglII (473) andPstI (1412). The deletion of the A-rich loop (HIV/del-A) and the construction of mutation HIV/A2 have been described previously (17Liang C. Li X.G. Rong L.W. Inouye P. Quan Y.D. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. J.

We also engineered a substitutional mutation (HIV/HUA) by replacing the sequence 624AATCTCTAGCAG635 with 5′-GAACACCCAACATT-3′; this was done by PCR using an antisense primer 5′-CCTGTTCGGGCGCCAAATGTTGGGTGTTCTTCCACA CTGACTAAAGG-3′ (positions 650–606), containing the above substitutions (underlined) and a NarI restriction site (GGCGCC), together with a sense primer, 5′-AGACCAGATC TGAGAATGG-3′ (positions 468–486), that contained aBglII restriction site (AGATCT) (see Fig. 3 A) (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Partial deletions of sequences downstream of the PBS,i.e. HIV/LD1, HIV/LD2, and HIV/LD3, were generated as described (23Li X.G. Liang C. Quan Y.D. Chandok R. Laughrea M. Parniak M.A. Kleiman L.

These reactions were performed as described using RNA template that was generated through use of an Ambion Mega-scripts kit (Austin, TX) (see Fig. 1 A) (17Liang C. Li X.G. Rong L.W. Inouye P.

Reverse transcription reactions were performed in a volume of 20 μl containing 1 pmol of primer:RNA template complex, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, dNTPs, 20 units of RNA guard ribonuclease inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and reverse transcriptase at 37 °C for various times, after which reactions were terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. In some experiments, reverse transcription reactions were performed in the presence of HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NC) protein (30 pmol for each reaction) as described (21Li X.G. Quan Y.D. Arts E.J. Li Z.

The cDNA products were fractionated on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. The RT preparations used included wild-type HIV-1 enzyme (p66/51) prepared as described (25Wohrl N.M.

Initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription is a distinct step from that of elongation (18Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Lanchy J.-M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R.

Biochimie. 1996; 78: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To further investigate this subject, we developed an in vitro reaction system that employed a PBS that contained only G, A, and C among the 5 nt at its 5′-end (Fig.1 A). Therefore, when dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP were included in these reactions, only early products of reverse transcription were generated. Reactions were also performed with only dCTP (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) or both dCTP and dTTP (Fig.1 A, lane 2) to provide information on the positions of the first and second bands seen on gels. The results of Fig. 1 Ashow that reaction products were observed at both the +1 and +3 positions in addition to a final expected product at the +5 site (lane 3). These reactions did not pause at either the +2 or +4 positions, indicating that they were rate-limiting only after the first and third nt were added. To prove that the above-mentioned pause sites (i.e. +1 and +3) were not due to an absence of dATP in the reactions, experiments performed with all four dNTPs were terminated at different times (5, 15, or 45 min), with the result that the +1 and +3 pause sites were still present (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4, 5, and 6). We next observed that the +1 and +3 pause sites were also present when increased concentrations of dNTPs, i.e. 80 nm, 160 nm, 320 nm, 640 nm, 1.28 μm, and 2.56 μm were employed in reactions that yielded higher levels of (−) strand DNA products (Fig.1 B). However, the +1 nt pausing site became increasingly faint with addition of higher concentrations of dNTP, whereas the +3 nt pause site did not diminish in intensity; this suggests that both pause sites are integral features of HIV-1 reverse transcription reactions and are seen most clearly in reactions performed at dNTP concentrations of 160 nm (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). To study the role of sequences at the 5′-end of the PBS, we generated a mutated RNA template termed HIV/del-A that contained a deletion of the A-rich loop (622AAAA625) and a mutated RNA template HIV/HUA described above (Fig. 2 A). The latter construct contained only T, A, and C within the 13 nt at the 5′-end of the PBS; hence, when only dATP, dTTP, and dGTP are included in reactions with the HIV/HUA template, extension should only proceed to the +13 stage. In reactions performed with 45 ng of HIV-1 RT, tRNALys.3 as primer, and wt RNA genome, i.e. HIV/WT, three bands at positions +1, +3, and +5 were clearly observed (Fig.2 A, lane 9). However, when either HIV/del-A or HIV/HUA served as RNA template, only one band at position +1 was seen, even when three different dNTPs were included (lanes 1–6); furthermore, this band was weaker than that seen at the same position with the wt RNA template HIV/WT. Considering the (−) strand DNA products at the +3 and +5 positions in the case of wt RNA template HIV/WT, deletion of the A-rich loop or substitutions within the region nt 624–635 led to both greatly diminished efficiency of initiation, as well as an arrest of extension at the +1 nt position. To investigate the effects of HIV/del-A and HIV/HUA on the +3 pausing event, higher quantities of RT, i.e. 405 ng, were used to extend reactions beyond the +1 stage. In this circumstance, extended products (both +3 and +5) were observed in reactions performed with the HIV/del-A mutated RNA template (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–3). However, when HIV/HUA was used, we detected extended products at the +5 and +13 sites and no pausing at the +3 site (lanes 4–6). Therefore, the presence of the A-rich loop (622–625) and maintenance of sequences at positions 624–635 are necessary for a release from the +1 nt pause site to occur; in addition, the strong pausing at the +3 position is dependent on nt sequences 624–635 at the 5′-end of the PBS. We also investigated the 3′-end of the PBS in the initiation of (−) strand DNA synthesis through use of appropriate deleted RNA templates,i.e. HIV/LD1, HIV/LD2, and HIV/LD3, containing deletions at wt positions 654–671, 672–691, and 692–707, respectively (Fig.3). When tRNALys.3 was used as primer, similar band patterns were observed in reactions that used either wt RNA template (HIV/WT) or the mutated RNA templates (HIV/LD1, HIV/LD2, and HIV/LD3), although reactions proceeded less efficiently with the latter constructs (Fig. 3). As shown above, reverse transcription initiated from tRNALys.3 still paused at the +1 position, even when sequences at both the 5′- and 3′-ends of the PBS were changed. When the first nt at the 5′-end of the PBS was changed from G to T (i.e. template HIV/HUA), the addition of the first dATP still represented a rate-limiting step (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4–6). To study whether this was unique to RNA primers, reactions were also performed with an 18nt DNA primer, i.e. d-Lys.3, bound to the PBS. When only dCTP was included in the reaction mixture, only one band was seen at position +1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). When both dCTP and dTTP were present, a band corresponding to nt position +2 was observed, and that at the +1 position had disappeared (lane 2). When dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP were included, two bands corresponding to the +3 and +5 nt pause sites were observed (lane 3). When all four dNTPs were present, extension occurred to beyond the +5 position, although a strong pause site at nt position +3 was still present, regardless whether reactions were run for 5, 15, or 45 min (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4, 5, and6). Thus, when a DNA oligomer was utilized as primer, reactions did not pause at the +1 site, but they did pause at position +3. Wild-type HIV-1 RT (p66/51) possesses RNase H activity. Because the latter might interfere in assays that used a DNA primer, experiments were performed with a mutant RT (i.e. E478Q RT), defective in RNase H activity. The results of Fig. 4 B show that reactions performed with this enzyme (i.e. RNase H-) did not pause at the +1 site, although pausing still occurred at the +3 position (lane 3). When all four dNTPs were included, further extension of (−) strand DNA was observed. However, reactions were still partially arrested at the +3 position, even over periods as long as 45 min (lanes 4–6). Therefore, RNase H activity was not responsible for reaction release after addition of the first nt when a DNA primer was used. As a control for our experiments with the 18 nt DNA primer, we also employed an 18 nt RNA primer complementary to the PBS. Consistent with results obtained with tRNALys.3 as primer, we found that these reactions also paused at the +1 nt position (data not shown). Hence, the +1 nt pausing event is associated with use of RNA primers during initiation of synthesis of (−) strand DNA. As stated, the +3 pause site was dependent on the nature of the template but not the primer (i.e. DNA or RNA) used in these reactions. To further verify such template dependence, experiments were performed with the DNA primer d-Lys.3 and the mutated viral RNA templates HIV/del-A and HIV/HUA. The results of Fig.5 show that extension from the DNA primer occurred normally in reactions performed with either wt (HIV/WT) or the mutated (HIV/del-A, HIV/HUA) RNA templates. However, when HIV/HUA was used, no strong pausing was observed at the +3 position (lane 6), consistent with results obtained with the cognate primer, tRNALys.3 (Fig. 2 B). To study whether NC protein could affect the +1 and +3 pausing events in reverse transcription reactions primed with tRNALys.3, 30 pmol of NC protein was added to our 20-μl reaction system, and reactions were terminated at various times (1, 4, 16, 32, and 64 min) (Fig. 6, lanes 1–5). A similar time-course without NC protein was also performed as a control (Fig. 6, lanes 6–10). The data show that inclusion of NC resulted in significantly less pausing at the +1 nt position and did not affect the +3 nt pause site. Furthermore, more +5 nt product was generated in the presence of NC protein, suggesting that NC had contributed to more efficient elongation of reverse transcription. When a still higher dNTP concentration was used,i.e. 2.56 μm, four additional pause sites were observed at positions +11, +12, +13, and +14, corresponding to the four As found within the A-rich-loop (622AAAA625). These four bands diminished in intensity when reactions were incubated for longer times, e.g. 45 min (Fig.7, lanes 4- 6). To confirm that these four bands were due to the presence of the A-rich loop in wt genomic RNA, the mutated template, HIV/del-A, deleted of these As, was studied. The results of Fig. 7 show this resulted in elimination of these bands (Fig. 7, lanes 7–9). When a different RNA template was used, i.e. HIV/A2 (deleted of the four As at positions 622–625 but containing As instead of Gs at positions 620 and 621, thus partially reconstituting a A-rich region), the result was reappearance of the pause sites at positions +11, +12, and +13 (lane 10), although the pause site at the +11 site gradually disappeared as reactions were incubated for longer times (e.g. 45 min) (lanes 10–12). Therefore, the A-rich loop is apparently responsible for specific pause sites during synthesis of (−) strand DNA. Biochemical analysis has shown that the initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription can be distinguished from subsequent elongation (18Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Lanchy J.-M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R.

Biochimie. 1996; 78: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The biological relevance of this observation is suggested by the fact that RT can lose its ability to discriminate against a nonself tRNA primer when the latter was extended by two nt (27Oude Essink B.B. Das A.T. Berkhout B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Second,in vitro labeling revealed that primer tRNALys.3 was extended by two nt within virus particles that had engaged in synthesis of (−) strand DNA (28Huang Y. Wang J. Shalom A. Li Z. Khorchid A. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 726-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our system, initiation has been characterized on the basis of several early pause sites (e.g. +1 and +3) that add substantially to our understanding of early events in reverse transcription. This is the first demonstration that pausing at the +1 nt site represents a rate-limiting step in reverse transcription reactions performed with an HIV-1 RNA template and the cognate primer tRNALys.3. This is not an unexpected finding because HIV-1 RT possesses both RNA-dependent DNA polymerization and DNA-dependent DNA polymerization activities. During reverse transcription, the enzyme is bound to either RNA-DNA or DNA-DNA hybrids during RNA-dependent DNA polymerization and DNA-dependent DNA polymerization, respectively, except at the initiation of synthesis of (−) strand strong-stop DNA ((−) ssDNA), when the enzyme is bound to a RNA-RNA hybrid and employs tRNALys.3 as primer for production of cDNA. After initiation takes place, the role of primer is effectively replaced by the newly made DNA, from which further extension will occur (5Skalka A.M. Goff S. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Therefore, the initiation of (−) ssDNA synthesis is a distinct stage of reverse transcription, especially in regard to incorporation of the first dNTP. When the first C deoxyribonucleotide from the dNTP pool is added to the 3′-OH of the A ribonucleotide at the 3′-end of tRNALys.3, displacement of a ribonucleotide-ribonucleotide pair (A-U) must occur in favor of a newly formed deoxyribonucleotide-ribonucleotide pair (dC-G) at the RT polymerization active site. Due to the absence of a 2′-OH residue in dC, the two nucleotide pairs (A-U and dC-G) may assume different conformations. Therefore, a structural rearrangement of the polymerization active site is required for the RT enzyme to adapt to the new dC-G pair and to add the next deoxyribonucleotide (dT) to the one-base extended primer. It is generally believed that a conformational change of RT must precede the chemical step, resulting in a rate-limiting event (29Hsie H.J.C. Zinnen S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24607-24613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8743-8751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rittinger K. Divita G. Goody R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8046-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Our results show that this rate-limiting step results in the pause site at the +1 position. Because the RT enzyme was originally bound to a RNA-RNA helix, it may require a conformational rearrangement to switch its binding mode from a RNA-RNA duplex to a DNA-RNA hybrid during synthesis of (−) ssDNA. Our results demonstrate that this conformational rearrangement may begin to occur as soon as the first dC has been added. In contrast, the use of the DNA primer, d-Lys.3, necessitates that the duplex to which RT is bound will always be a DNA-RNA hybrid, thus permitting the enzyme to catalyze the extension reaction without a change in conformation. Consequently, reactions primed by the DNA primer, d-Lys.3, do not need to pause after addition of the first dC. Other studies have also indicated that a conformational rearrangement might be required for RT to proceed after addition of the first nt. Direct evidence for this comes from studies of the relationship between the RNase H cleavage site and the polymerization active site (26Gotte M. Fackler S. Herman T. Perola E. Cellai L. Gross H.J. Le Grice S.F.G. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Generally, a constant distance of 18 nt must exist between the RNase H cleavage site and the nascent primer 3′ terminus. However, a distance of 19 nt instead of 18 nt was observed between these sites after incorporation of the first dC at the 3′-end of primer tRNALys.3 (26Gotte M. Fackler S. Herman T. Perola E. Cellai L. Gross H.J. Le Grice S.F.G. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because the spatial relationship between the functional RNase H cleavage site and the polymerization active site serves as an indication of RT conformation, the 19-nt distance suggests a novel conformation for RT after incorporation of the first nt. Other evidence for this has been provided by studies of the binding and kinetic properties of HIV-1 RT during initiation and elongation that showed that RT dissociated approximately 200 times faster from the initiation (RNA template/tRNALys.3) than from the elongation complex (19Lanchy J.-M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Further supporting this notion, mutagenesis studies of the HIV-1 RT palm subdomain have shown that RNA and DNA primers may be differentially recognized by RT, i.e. RT may be associated with RNAversus DNA primers in different conformations (33Ghosh M. Williams I. Powell M.D. Levin J.G. LeGrice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5758-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This also helps to account for the importance of the +1 pause site demonstrated in this paper. We have also noted that synthesis of (−) strand DNA paused at the +3 nt position, regardless whether tRNALys.3 or a DNA primer was employed. This suggests that the secondary structure of the complex formed between the viral RNA template and the primer must play a role in the specification of this pause site. The PBS and its flanking sequences constitute a highly ordered secondary structure. The binding of the tRNALys.3 primer to the PBS results in a complex with altered secondary structure in the region of the PBS, in which the three nt (GAC) at the 5′-end of the PBS are looped out and the eight nt just at the 5′-end of the PBS bind to other complementary sequences to form a stable stem structure (8Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 9Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25269-25272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, when extension from the primer reaches the +3 stage (dG), the stem structure has to be disrupted before the fourth nucleotide (dC) can be added, resulting in pausing at the +3 nt position (Fig. 8 A). A similar secondary structure is probably formed when the DNA primer,d-Lys.3, is bound to the PBS, such that pausing at the +3 stage also occurs in this circumstance. This hypothesis is supported by our experiments in which a mutated RNA template, HIV/HUA, containing substitutional changes at the 5′-end of the PBS (624–635) was employed (Fig. 2 B). In this situation, the stem structure shown in the wt RNA template (Fig.8 A) was disrupted (Fig. 8 B). As a consequence, we found that pausing no longer occurred at the +3 position. In addition, reactions that employed the mutated RNA template HIV/del-A (Fig.2 B) paused less frequently at the +3 nt site than did those performed with wild-type RNA template (HIV/WT). This result might also be attributable to a destabilization of the stem-loop caused by deletion of the A-rich loop, because mutations in this region can cause disturbances in secondary structure of complexes between tRNALys.3 and viral genomic RNA (34Isel C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, template structure may be responsible for the type of pausing seen at the +3 position during initiation of synthesis of (−) strand DNA. Our data add significantly to the notion that the initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription represents a distinct phase in RT reactions (18Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Lanchy J.-M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Lanchy J.M. Isel C. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). First, we have documented that a pause site at the +1 position is rate-limiting. The failure of other groups to have previously detected this site might be due to their use of higher concentrations of dNTPs (e.g. 50 μm). Also, the tRNALys.3 employed in our experiments is from human placenta rather than from other animal species. Because all retroviruses use tRNAs as primers, the +1 pausing site may be common to all RTs. Second, the transition from initiation to elongation probably occurs at the +1 site as well as at the previously observed +3 and +5 positions. On the basis of our studies, the +3 pause site strongly depends on the secondary structure of the viral RNA template. Conceivably, the +1 position may represent the actual point of transition from initiation to elongation, and the +3 pause site may be involved in the arrest of reactions at other early stages. Finally, the A-rich loop, as well as other sequences at the 5′-end of the PBS, may be involved in both the efficiency of initiation as well as release from the +1 pause site. The +1 and +3 pausing events in viral reverse transcription may play a regulatory role similar to that observed in the case of E. coli RNA polymerase, for which initiation of gene transcription begins in an abortive mode and pauses near the start site, and for which a regulatory subunit, ς, is required for transcription to proceed to elongation (35McClure W.R. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 36von Hippel P.H. Bear D.G. Morgan W.D. McJwiggen J.A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 389-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In HIV-1, the NC protein may play a role analogous to that of the ς factor, because NC can help to overcome the +1 pausing event (Fig. 6). NC protein is also able to unwind the secondary structure of template RNA, facilitating the synthesis of long products of reverse transcription (37Wu W. Henderson L.E. Copeland T.D. Gorelick R.J. Boche W.J. Rein A. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7132-7142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and can stimulate the annealing of complementary RNA and/or DNA sequences to stabilize hybrids (38Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. De Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We believe that NC helps to form and stabilize complexes between primer tRNALys.3 and viral genomic RNA and that the +3 nt pause site is a consequence of the secondary structure of the complex thus formed. In this context, the +3 nt pause site should be observed both when NC protein is present or absent, as observed in the results of Fig. 6. The role of the A-rich loop in HIV-1 reverse transcription and viral replication is controversial (39Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4013-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutations in the A-rich loop resulted in both severely diminished initiation efficiency of HIV-1 reverse transcription and defective transition from initiation to elongation (Refs. 17Liang C. Li X.G. Rong L.W. Inouye P. Quan Y.D. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5750-5757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 18Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar and this report). However, our use of viral RNA template deleted of the A-rich loop, HIV/del-A, resulted in only a modest decrease in amount of final (−) strand DNA product (171 nt) (Fig. 7). Consistently, viruses containing a deletion of the A-rich loop were only moderately impaired in replicative capacity (17Liang C. Li X.G. Rong L.W. Inouye P. Quan Y.D. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5750-5757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies show that the A-rich loop is responsible for four strong pause sites, +11 through +14, that limit processivity and that deletion of these four As eliminated these pause sites and yielded longer (−) strand DNA products. Thus, the initial deficit in viral replication caused by deletion of the A-rich loop may have been partially compensated by elimination of the pause sites at positions +11 through +14."
https://openalex.org/W2076349553,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) belongs to the family of the “four-helix bundle” cytokines. The extracellular parts of their receptors consist of several Ig- and fibronectin type III-like domains. Characteristic of these receptors is a cytokine-binding module consisting of two such fibronectin domains defined by a set of four conserved cysteines and a tryptophan-serine-X-tryptophan-serine (WSXWS) sequence motif. On target cells, IL-6 binds to a specific IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and the complex of IL-6·IL-6R associates with the signal transducing protein gp130. The IL-6R consists of three extracellular domains. The NH2-terminal Ig-like domain is not needed for ligand binding and signal initiation. Here we have investigated the properties and functional role of the third membrane proximal domain. The protein can be efficiently expressed in bacteria, and the refolded domain is shown to be sufficient for IL-6 binding. When complexed with IL-6, however, it fails to associate with the gp130 protein. Since the second and the third domain together with IL-6 can bind to gp130 and induce signaling, our data demonstrate the ligand binding function of the third domain and point to an important role of the second domain in complex formation with gp130 and signaling.

All these cytokines act via receptor complexes, which contain at least one molecule of gp130, the common signal transducing protein of the IL-6 family of cytokines (2Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). IL-6 and IL-11 act via a homodimer of gp130, whereas CT-1, CNTF, LIF, and OSM require a heterodimer of gp130 and the related protein LIF-receptor (LIF-R) (2Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that in the human system OSM additionally binds and acts via a receptor complex consisting of gp130 and the OSM receptor, a protein related to gp130 and LIF-R (3Mosley B.

In the murine system, the gp130 and OSM receptor complex seems to be the only complex that is bound and activated by OSM (4Ichihara M. Hara T. Kim H. Murate T. Miyajima A.

Interestingly, the cytokines IL-6, IL-11, CT-1, and CNTF first bind to their specific receptor proteins and induce intracellular signaling by subsequent association of this complex with a gp130/gp130 homodimer or a gp130/LIF-R heterodimer. In contrast, LIF and OSM bind directly to LIF-R and gp130, respectively, leading to the formation of heterodimeric gp130-LIF-R or gp130/OSM-R complexes (2Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Thus, LIF and OSM do not require specific cytokine receptor subunits as do IL-6, IL-11, CT-1, and CNTF. The three-dimensional structures of IL-6 (5Somers W. Stahl M. Seehra J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), CNTF (6McDonald N.Q. Panayotatos N. Hendrickson W.A.

The specific ligand binding receptors for IL-6, IL-11, and CNTF are membrane proteins, the extracellular parts of which consist of three domains. Cytokine binding occurs via the cytokine-binding module (CBM), which consists of the second (D2) and the third (D3) domains. The three-dimensional structure of the CBM domain of gp130 has recently been solved (8Bravo J. Staunton D. Heath J.K. Jones E.Y.

In contrast to most soluble receptors for cytokines and growth factors, the soluble receptors of the IL-6 family complexed with their ligands can elicit a biological signal on cells that only express the signaling subunits gp130 and LIF-R. This process has recently been called transsignaling (14Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Whereas virtually all cells of the body express gp130, the proteins LIF-R, IL-6R, CNTF-R, and IL-11R are only expressed on some cell types (2Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that cell types that respond exclusively to IL-6/sIL-6R, but not to IL-6 alone, include hematopoietic progenitor cells (15Peters M. Schirmacher P. Goldschmitt J.

So far, the contribution of the single D2 and D3 domains to ligand binding and gp130 activation has not been analyzed. Here we show that the D3 domain alone is sufficient for IL-6 binding but cannot associate with gp130. Restriction enzymes were obtained from AGS (Heidelberg, Germany). Vent polymerase was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was purchased from GERBU (Gaisheim, Germany). Guanidine hydrochloride was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). The preparation of the polyclonal monospecific antisera against IL-6R (6.2) was described previously (21Stoyan T. Michaelis U.

PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl of PCR buffer (10 mmKCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm of each dNTP) containing 0.25 ng of template DNA, 0.5 unit of Vent DNA-polymerase, and 1 μm D3 sense and antisense primer pairs, respectively. Amplification of D3 DNA by PCR was performed with 35 cycles of denaturation (45 s, 94 °C), primer annealing (45 s, 60 °C), and elongation (45 s, 72 °C). PCR products were purified, subsequently digested with NdeI and HindIII, and ligated into the pRSET 5b vector opened with NdeI andHindIII. The D3 cDNA construct was verified by restriction analysis and automated DNA sequencing. E. coliBL21 (DE3) cells (23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W.

Enfors S.-O. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1995; 47: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml), glucose (5 g/liter), and trace elements (25Neubauer P. Häggström L. Enfors S.-O. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1995; 47: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), inoculated with a 2-ml culture of a single clone, and cultured overnight at 37 °C. A biofermentor (BIOFLO 3000, New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) was charged with 3 liters of minimal medium, inoculated with the total overnight culture, and incubated at 37 °C and a minimum oxygen saturation of 30%. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration: 0.4 mm) at an A600 of about 3 when a specific growth rate of μ = 0.7 was reached, and the fermentation process was maintained for a further 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Complete lysis of bacteria was achieved by three freeze/thaw steps followed by two cycles of sonification (3 min) and several cycles of washing and centrifugation resulting in a preparation of purified inclusion bodies. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6m guanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol. A Superdex200 (16/60) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated with refolding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA), loaded with 1.5 ml of solubilized inclusion bodies (200 μg of protein), and run with a constant flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Fractions of 2 ml were collected, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and significant fractions were pooled and concentrated. By this method 30 mg of purified protein were obtained from a single fermentation process (3 liters of bacterial culture). CD measurements were carried out on an Aviv (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) 62DS CD spectrometer equipped with a temperature control unit and a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter, both calibrated according to Chen and Yang (26Chen G.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Lett. 1977; 10: 1195-1207Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The spectral bandwidth was 1.5 nm. The time constant ranged between 1 and 4 s and the cell path length between 0.1 and 10 mm. For detection of D3, purified protein or inclusion bodies from different purification steps were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nylon filters (GeneScreen Plus, NEN Life Science Products). Filters were blocked and incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibody to IL-6R 1:2000 followed by anti-rabbit IgG POD conjugate 1:2000. Peroxidase activity was detected using precipitating BM blue POD substrate. Binding of D3 to IL-6 was analyzed by sandwich ELISA at 22 °C. Purified recombinant IL-6 was coated on ELISA plate wells (Microtest III, Falcon, Oxnard, CA) at 10 μg/ml. After blocking of unspecific binding with PBS containing 5% skimmed milk powder, D3 was applied at 10 μg/ml. After washing, bound protein was detected with polyclonal rabbit antibody to IL-6R 1:2000 followed by anti-rabbit IgG POD conjugate 1:2000. Peroxidase activity was detected with soluble BM blue POD. In every ELISA, recombinant soluble IL-6R (consisting of D2 and D3), expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified as described previously (20Vollmer P. Peters M. Ehlers M. Yagame H. Matsuba T. Kondo M. Yasukawa K. Büschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 199: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was applied in paralell at 10 μg/ml. For negative control the equivalent experiment was performed with the ELISA plate wells coated with PBS containing 5% skimmed milk. 100 ng of purified D3 protein or sIL-6R were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with a 20-fold excess of human IL-6-Fc or a 10-fold excess of human gp130-Fc (alone or in combination with 300 ng of recombinant human IL-6) or a human IL6-sIL-6R fusion construct called H-IL-6-Fc (27Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Kallen K.J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). 2T. Jostock, S. Rose-John, and J. Müllberg, manuscript in preparation. All Fc proteins were obtained from supernatants of transiently transfected COS-7 cells and purified via protein A affinity chromatography. Concentrations were checked using standard protein assays. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose, separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted as described above. Both precipitated D3 protein and sIL-6R again were detected using polyclonal rabbit antibody to IL-6R. IL-6 was covalently immobilized to a carboxymethyl dextran matrix (Fisons, Loughborough, UK) at 2.25 μg/ml for 2 min in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, as recommended by the manufacturer (28Krebs B. Griffin H. Winter G. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2858-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Binding experiments were performed at controlled temperature (25 °C) with 10 different concentrations of purified D3 protein using the IASYSTM(Fisons) optical biosensor. Association was monitored for at least 2 min, the sample was replaced by PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and dissociation was monitored accordingly before the cuvette was regenerated with 5 mm HCl and equilibrated again in PBST. Association and dissociation affinograms were analyzed by nonlinear regression with the FASTfit (Fisons) software, which uses the Marquardt-Levenburg algorithm for iterative data fitting. For expression of D3 of IL-6R in E. coli, the respective cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression vector pRSET 5b (23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar, 24van Dam M. Müllberg J. Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Brakenhoff J.P. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15285-15290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expressed protein consisted of D3 together with the epitope recognized by the antibody 6.2 (Fig.1 A) (21Stoyan T. Michaelis U. Schooltink H. Van Dam M. Rudolph R. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After expression in a biofermenter and lysis of cells, the protein was exclusively found in inclusion bodies (IB). No recombinant protein was found in the supernatant of the inclusion bodies (SN IB). The expressed protein was visualized as a 17-kDa band by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 B) and Western blotting (Fig. 1 C). Refolding and purification of the highly enriched protein was achieved by solubilization of the inclusion bodies in guanidine hydrochloride and subsequent gel filtration on a Superdex200 column equilibrated with sodium phosphate buffer (29Müller-Newen G. Pflanz S. Hassiepen U. Stahl J. Wollmer A. Heinrich P.C. Grötzinger J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Upon rechromatography of the refolded protein, a single peak was observed indicating that no dimers or higher aggregates were formed during the recovery process of D3 (data not shown). The folding state of the protein was characterized by CD spectroscopy. Fig.2 A shows the far-UV CD spectrum of D3. The spectrum was indicative of a protein in a folded state. The prominent band at 232 nm is the positive lobe of a couplet, which can be attributed to interacting tryptophan side chains (30Grishina I.B. Woody R.W. Faraday Discuss. 1994; 1994: 245-262Crossref Google Scholar). It had also been observed in the far-UV CD spectrum of the corresponding domain of the granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor receptor (31Anaguchi H. Hiraoka O. Yamasaki K. Naito S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27845-27851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and the third extracellular domain of gp130 (29Müller-Newen G. Pflanz S. Hassiepen U. Stahl J. Wollmer A. Heinrich P.C. Grötzinger J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This band seems to be characteristic of the WSXWS motif present in the COOH-terminal domain of the CBM in all class I cytokine receptors. Secondary structure analysis of the CD spectrum showed that the protein mainly consisted of β-sheet (D3: β-sheet = 56%; α-helix = 0%), confirming the secondary structure prediction (32Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). The folded state of the protein was also evident from the near-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 3 B), which showed several distinct bands attributable to tyrosine and tryptophan side chains (30Grishina I.B. Woody R.W. Faraday Discuss. 1994; 1994: 245-262Crossref Google Scholar). These data demonstrated that purification and refolding of D3 from solubilized inclusion bodies could be achieved in a one-step procedure using size-exclusion chromatography.Figure 3Thermal unfolding of D3. Thermal unfolding of D3 was monitored by recording a series of far-UV CD spectra with increasing temperature. A, far-UV CD spectra of D3 at different temperatures (trace 1, 25 °C; trace 2, 28 °C; trace 3, 31 °C; trace 4, 34 °C; trace 5, 37 °C; trace 6, 40 °C; trace 7, 43 °C). B, normalized 232 nm ellipticities of D3 plotted versus temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The thermal stability of the molecule at pH 6.8 was also studied by CD spectroscopy. Fig. 3 A shows a series of far-UV CD spectra recorded at different temperatures. With increasing temperature the prominent positive band at 232 nm decreases. The ellipticity at 232 nm was plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 3 B. The transition midpoint for D3 at pH 6.8 is 35 °C, indicating a remarkable thermal instability of this domain. We next asked whether D3 was able to bind human IL-6. IL-6 was immobilized to a 96-well ELISA dish, and binding was assayed by indirect ELISA as described under “Materials and Methods.” D3 was recognized by the antibody 6.2 as efficiently as sIL-6R, as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 1 C). In Fig. 4, measurements of D3 and of sIL-6R binding to IL-6 are shown. Binding of IL-6 by D3 and by sIL-6R (consisting of domains D2 + D3) (20Vollmer P. Peters M. Ehlers M. Yagame H. Matsuba T. Kondo M. Yasukawa K. Büschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 199: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were comparable. When human IL-6 was immobilized to an IAsysTM cuvette (see “Materials and Methods”) real-time interaction between IL-6 and D3 could be analyzed. In Fig. 5 Aassociation curves recorded for 10 concentrations of D3 are shown. For clarity, dissociation, although measured for all concentrations, is shown only for the highest concentration. The obtained data were used to calculate an association rate, ka = 2.72 × 104 ± 1467.61 m−1s−1, and a dissociation rate, kd = 1.04 × 10−2 ± 0.0009 s−1, between IL-6 and D3. From these values an affinity of KD = 385 nm can be derived (Fig. 5 B). For comparison, reported affinities for the interaction of immobilized IL-6 and entire soluble IL-6R (33Weiergräber O. Hemmann U. Kuster A. Müller-Newen G. Schneider J. Rose-John S. Kurschat P. Brakenhoff J.P. Hart M.H. Stabel S. Heinrich P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or the immobilized entire sIL-6R and IL-6 (34Toniatti C. Cabibbo A. Sporena E. Salvati A.L. Cerretani M. Serafini S. Lahm A. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2726-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which also were mesured at controlled temperature (25 °C) (33Weiergräber O. Hemmann U. Kuster A. Müller-Newen G. Schneider J. Rose-John S. Kurschat P. Brakenhoff J.P. Hart M.H. Stabel S. Heinrich P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Toniatti C. Cabibbo A. Sporena E. Salvati A.L. Cerretani M. Serafini S. Lahm A. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2726-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), were about 10-fold higher. We next asked whether binding of D3 to IL-6 could be detected in solution and whether a D3/IL-6-complex was able to associate with the signal transducing protein gp130. To answer these questions we incubated purified D3 protein with Fc fusion proteins of IL-6 and gp130 in the presence or absence of IL-6. We have recently constructed a fusion protein consisting of human IL-6 and human soluble IL-6R in which both proteins were covalently linked by a flexible polypeptide linker (27Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Kallen K.J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). This fusion protein was called Hyper-IL-6 (H-IL-6). This IL-6/sIL-6R fusion protein was expressed as an Fc fusion protein (H-IL-6-Fc). Since we have shown that in the H-IL-6 fusion protein, the IL-6R binding site of IL-6 is not accessible for free IL-6R (27Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Kallen K.J. Brakenhoff J.P.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), this H-IL-6-Fc protein was used as a negative control. Bound protein was immunoprecipitated and detected by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.6 A, D3 could be precipitated with IL-6-Fc (left lane), but not with the combination of IL-6 and gp130-Fc. There was no binding of D3 to gp130-Fc alone or to H-IL-6-Fc. In Fig. 6 B the identical experiment is shown using the sIL-6R consisting of D2 and D3, which could be precipitated with both, IL-6-Fc, and the combination of IL-6 and gp130-Fc. Interestingly, the sIL-6R was almost quantitatively precipitated by IL-6-Fc, whereas only 5–10% of the D3 protein was captured by IL-6-Fc, possibly reflecting the lower affinity of D3 for IL-6 (see above). These results clearly show that D3 of sIL-6R, although being able to bind IL-6, could not mediate an association of the complex with gp130. Four conclusions can be drawn from our study: (i) the third domain of the human IL-6R can be expressed on its own and correctly refoldsin vitro. (ii) The protein is remarkably unstable to thermal perturbation. (iii) D3 on its own binds the ligand IL-6, albeit with a lower affinity than the complete human IL-6R. (iv) Although D3 is sufficient for IL-6 binding, the complex of D3 and IL-6 fails to associate with gp130. Receptors for the four-helix cytokines have been shown to be composed of Ig and fibronectin type III-like domains (35Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Specific ligand recognition has been ascribed to the CBM, which consists of two of such fibronectin type III-like domains defined by a set of four conserved cysteines and a tryptophan-serine-X-tryptophan-serine (WSXWS) sequence motif (32Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). In the case of the growth hormone-growth hormone receptor complex, it has been demonstrated that both domains of the CBM are involved in ligand binding (9De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar). The extracellular portion of human IL-6R consists altogether of three domains (22Yamasaki K. Taga T. Hirata Y. Yawata H. Kawanishi Y. Seed B. Taniguchi T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1988; 241: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain has been shown to be dispensable for ligand recognition and signal initiation (19Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M. Yamasaki K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Vollmer P. Peters M. Ehlers M. Yagame H. Matsuba T. Kondo M. Yasukawa K. Büschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 199: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recent experiments might point to a role of the NH2-terminal domain of the IL-6R for intracellular processing and protein stability. 3P. Vollmer, B. Oppmann, N. Voltz, and S. Rose-John, submitted for publication. Ligand recognition by the CBM of human IL-6R is believed to occur via the loops which connect the β-strands within the two fibronectin type III-like domains (36Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rose-John S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In analogy to the growth hormone-growth hormone receptor complex, the third domain of IL-6R is predicted to establish a contact with the respective domain of the CBM of gp130 (36Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rose-John S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In fact, mutations in a membrane proximal loop region of the IL-6R, which was predicted to be involved in such a contact, turned out to prevent association of the IL-6·IL-6R complex with gp130 (37Salvati A.L. Lahm A. Paonessa G. Ciliberto G. Toniatti C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12242-12249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Such IL-6R muteins turned out to be weak antagonists of IL-6 (37Salvati A.L. Lahm A. Paonessa G. Ciliberto G. Toniatti C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12242-12249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that D3 of human IL-6R on its own is sufficient for ligand binding. The affinity we measured is about 1 order of magnitude lower than the one determined for the entire sIL-6R (33Weiergräber O. Hemmann U. Kuster A. Müller-Newen G. Schneider J. Rose-John S. Kurschat P. Brakenhoff J.P. Hart M.H. Stabel S. Heinrich P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Toniatti C. Cabibbo A. Sporena E. Salvati A.L. Cerretani M. Serafini S. Lahm A. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2726-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As suggested by our model of the IL-6·IL-6R complex (36Grötzinger J.

The D2 portion of IL-6R is in contact with the 2c region (loop between the helix A and the helix B) (38Ehlers M. Grötzinger J. deHon F.D. Müllberg J. Brakenhoff J.P. Liu J. Wollmer A. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1744-1753PubMed Google Scholar). The D3 portion of the IL-6R touches the COOH-terminal part of helix D, which also has been implicated in receptor binding (39Krüttgen A.

Schwabe M. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14832-14838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the low affinity between D3 and IL-6, which we observed in this study, is that loop residues of D2 contribute to ligand binding and thereby to the affinity of the IL-6R (36Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rose-John S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As discussed above, D3 was shown to be essential for the contact between IL-6R and gp130. Our data demonstrate that this contact is not sufficient for association of the D3·IL-6 complex with gp130. This implies that D2 is needed for the formation of the complex between IL-6, IL-6R, and gp130. We have shown that D3 of the human IL-6R has a remarkably low thermal stability. Unfolding starts already at 28 °C. For comparison, the analogous domain of gp130 is stable up to 34 °C. One consequence of this instability of D3 is that this protein does not exhibit antagonistic activity on cells stimulated with human IL-6 (data not shown). Such assays have to be performed at 37 °C a temperature at which D3 is already unfolded. Since a recombinant version of sIL-6R consisting of D2 and D3 is stable at 37 °C (20Vollmer P. Peters M.

Methods. 1996; 199: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it can be concluded that in this complex D2 and D3 must stabilize each other. It has been suggested recently that the complex of IL-6, IL-6R, and gp130 has a stochiometry of two molecules each of IL-6, IL-6R, and gp130 (41Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G. Yasukawa K.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Steric considerations led us to suggest a tetrameric model of the receptor complex containing one molecule each of IL-6 and IL-6R associated with two molecules of gp130 (36Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rose-John S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Of note, our tetrameric model would predict a close contact of D2 of IL-6R with one gp130 protein (36Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rose-John S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this respect it is worth mentioning that mutation of valine 190 in the human IL-6R resulted in loss of complex formation between IL-6·IL-6R and gp130 (19Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M. Yamasaki K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whereas IL-6 binding to IL-6R was unchanged (19Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M. Yamasaki K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Valine 190 resides within D2 (22Yamasaki K. Taga T. Hirata Y. Yawata H. Kawanishi Y. Seed B. Taniguchi T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1988; 241: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to a part of D3 in the human IL-6R was shown to inhibit the biological activity of IL-6 without disturbing binding of IL-6 to IL-6R (44Grube B.J. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20791-20797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these data it can be concluded that both D2 and D3 seem to be involved in complex formation between IL-6·IL-6R and gp130. Our data add to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the association of the components IL-6, IL-6R, and gp130 in the receptor complex. Futhermore no experimental structural information is available on human IL-6R, the reported strategy of bacterial expression and refolding of the IL-6R domain, which is important for ligand binding, might be the basis for experiments aiming at structure elucidation by NMR spectroscopy or x-ray crystallography."

Different glycosylation levels may be responsible for its heterogeneity. It contains four putative asparagine-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr). Systematic site-directed mutagenesis (Asn replaced with Gln) of these four sites was undertaken, and 11 (single, double, triple, and quadruple (N-4)) mutants were produced in COS-7 and/or CHO-K1 cells and characterized. All of the sites were N-glycosylated with preferential glycosylation of the Asn14 and the Asn271. The suppression of the Asn14 glycosylation site led to 5 times lower Km and a 10 times lowerkcat. Angiotensinogen heterogeneity was much lower for the N-4 mutant protein, which produced a single form at 48 kDa. Pulse-chase experiments showed slight intracellular retention (15%) of the deglycosylated protein after 24 h. Interestingly, the N-4 mutant had a higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 5.0versus 1.6 μm−1 · s−1) than the wild-type protein. The thermal stability of the N-4 protein was unaffected by deglycosylation, suggesting that it was correctly folded.

This reaction is the first step of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure, salt homeostasis, and vascular tone. In humans, renin cleaves angiotensinogen at its N terminus, generating the inactive decapeptide, angiotensin I (Ang I), 1The abbreviations used are: Ang Iangiotensin IAGTangiotensinogenPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresishAGThuman AGTCHOChinese hamster ovaryELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. which is further hydrolyzed by Ang I-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) to give active angiotensin II. The generation of Ang I in plasma, and probably also in tissue, is a first-order kinetic reaction and is the rate-limiting step of the renin-angiotensin enzymatic cascade (1Gould A.B. Green D.

Interest in the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene was renewed when it was implicated in blood pressure regulation in animals (2Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R. Hodgin J.B. Best C.F.

Rev. 1997; 18: 662-677PubMed Google Scholar). The M235T polymorphism was rapidly identified as the most interesting of several genetic variants due to its association with plasma angiotensinogen concentration and essential hypertension (4Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y. Lifton R.P. Williams C.S. Charru A. Hunt S.C. Hopkins P.N. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.M. Corvol P. Cell. 1992; 71: 169-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). This association probably results from the strong linkage disequilibrium between the M235T polymorphism and the G−6A substitution in the promoter (5Inoue I. Nakajima T. Williams C.S. Quackenbush J.

However, rare missense mutations within the coding region may also affect function. One such mutation at the renin cleavage site, L10F, was first identified in a preeclamptic woman and caused a doubling in the catalytic efficiency of the renin angiotensinogen reaction (6Inoue I. Rohrwasser A. Helin C. Jeunemaitre X. Crain P. Bohlender J. Lifton R.P. Corvol P. Ward K. Lalouel J.M. J. Biol.

We have studied a family with another rare missense mutation, Y248C, which generates an extraN-glycosylation site leading to the production of an additional 61-kDa form when the cDNA is expressed in CHO cells (7Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Leconte I. Cohen P. Simon D. Guyene T.T. Célérier J. Pau B. Corvol P. Clauser P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol.

The parallelism between the intracellular retention observed in vitro and the decrease in plasma angiotensinogen concentration in affected heterozygous individuals highlighted the involvement of glycosylation in the intracellular processing of angiotensinogen. Plasma human angiotensinogen is a heterogeneous glycoprotein mainly produced by hepatocytes. Pure human angiotensinogen usually gives at least two major bands at about 60 kDa, separated by 3 or 4 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (for a review, see Ref. 8Tewksbury D.A. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and Management. Raven Press, New York1990: 1197-1216Google Scholar). A similar level of heterogeneity has been reported for other mammalian species (9Skeggs L.T. Lentz K.E. Hochstrasser H. Kahn J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1963; 118: 73-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Campbell D.J. Bouhnik J. Coezy E. Pinet F. Clauser E. Ménard J. Corvol P.

Treatment of pure human plasma angiotensinogen with trifluoromethane sulfonic acid or glycopeptidase F reduces its apparent molecular weight by 10 kDa, but angiotensinogen still displays two or three bands in SDS-PAGE (15Campbell D.J. Charlton P.A. Grinham C.J. Mooney C.J. Pendlebury J.E. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These data suggest that glycosylation plays a predominant role in angiotensinogen heterogeneity. However, the effect of human angiotensinogen glycosylation on protein secretion, stability, and reaction with renin is not fully understood. Hilgenfeldt et al. (16Hilgenfeldt U. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 56: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reported differences in the half-lives of the two major glycoforms in rats; the highly glycosylated form was secreted faster by the liver and eliminated more slowly by the kidney than the less glycosylated form. Human angiotensinogen has four potential sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser/Thr): Asn14-Lys15-Ser16, Asn137-Cys138-Thr139, Asn271-Ser272-Thr273, and Asn295-Phe296-Ser297. The first site (Asn14-Lys15-Ser16) is closest to the renin cleavage site (Leu10-Val11) and may play a key role in the recognition of human angiotensinogen by human renin (17Cumin F. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Ménard J. Corvol P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 913: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if all four Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequences are actually glycosylated. We describe herein the site-directed mutagenesis of singleN-glycosylation sites and combinations of them in 11 mutants of human AGT (hAGT). Analysis of these mutant proteins, synthesized in eukaryotic cells, indicates that oligosaccharide residues are linked to each site, accounting for the heterogeneity of the protein in vitro. We found that Asn14 and Asn271 were preferentially glycosylated and that glycosylation of Asn14has a large effect on the kinetics of the reaction of human angiotensinogen with human recombinant renin. We also showed that a fully deglycosylated angiotensinogen is produced efficiently by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is a good renin substrate. A specific angiotensinogen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (18Cohen P. Badouaille G. Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Mani J.C. Guyene T-T. Jeunemaitre X. Ménard J. Corvol P. Pau B. Simon D. J. Clin.

Neuraminidase and O-glycosidase, cell culture reagents and fetal calf serum were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Meylan, France). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, pepstatin A, antipain, leupeptin, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma. Molecular masses were estimated by comparison with14C-methylated proteins from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and prestained SDS-PAGE molecular mass markers from Bio-Rad. The cDNA encoding the entire polypeptidique sequence of hAGT has been described elsewhere (19Gaillard I. Clauser E. Corvol P. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1989; 8: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The corresponding protein has a Met in position 235, the most frequent variant in Caucasian populations. The cDNA was inserted (7Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Leconte I. Cohen P. Simon D. Guyene T.T. Célérier J. Pau B. Corvol P. Clauser P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol.

The human AGT cDNA contains four N-linked potential glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) at amino acid positions 14, 137, 271, and 295. For single-stranded mutagenesis, the 1.7-kilobase pair insert was inserted between the XbaI and HindIII sites of M13mp19 to produce single-stranded DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis to convert each Asn into a Gln was performed using Kunkel's method (21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) with the Mutagene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad), recombinant single-stranded M13 DNA as template and an antisense mutagenesis oligonucleotide (Asn14 → Gln, 5′-ACA GGT ACT CTC TTG GTG GAT GAC GAG-3′; Asn137 → Gln, 5′-CCG GGA GGT GCA CTG CTT GTC CTT CCA-3′; Asn271 → Gln, 5′-CAC TGA GGT GCT CTG GTC CAC CCA GAA-3′; or Asn295 → Gln, 5′-AGT CAC CGA GAA CTG GTC CTG GAT GTC-3′) to produce the four mutant proteins with single residue changes: N14Q, N137Q, N271Q, and N295Q. Each mutated M13mp19 clone was sequenced (Sequenase II kit, U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and used for a second, third, and fourth round of mutagenesis to obtain double mutants (N14Q/N137Q and N271Q/N295Q) triple mutants (N14Q/N137Q/N271Q, N137Q/N271Q/N295Q, N14Q/N271Q/N295Q, and N137Q/N271Q/N295Q) and a quadruple mutant, in which all four Asn thought to be involved in N-glycosylation were mutated (N14Q/N137Q/N271Q/N295Q). This mutant was called N-4 (see Fig.1). Each hAGT mutant was sequenced and inserted into pECE. The 11 mutant hAGT cDNAs and the wild-type hAGT cDNA were used to transiently transfect COS-7 cells using the DEAE-dextran method (22Thibonnier M. Auzan C. Madhun Z. Wilkins P. Berti-Mattera L. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3304-3310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Cell lines producing wild-type angiotensinogen, the four separate single mutant proteins, and the N-4 mutant protein were established so that large amounts (10–40 mg) of proteins could be produced. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with a neomycin-resistant plasmid (pSV2 neo) by the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (23Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-340PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant cells were selected using 500 μg/ml Geneticin® (Life Technologies, Inc.). Pure cell lines overproducing wild-type angiotensinogen or mutant proteins were obtained by the limiting dilution method, as described previously (7Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Leconte I. Cohen P. Simon D.

CHO-K1 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Mutant and wild-type angiotensinogen proteins were metabolically labeled 48 h after transfection. Cells were incubated in 35 × 10-mm dishes in methionine- and cysteine-free Ham's F-12 medium (Eurobio) for 1 h. A pulse of 50 μCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was given for 10 min in methionine- and cysteine-free Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Various chase times were used in serum-free medium at 37 °C. The cells were solubilized at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) were added. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated overnight with 1 μl of normal rabbit serum (Nordic Immunological Laboratories) and 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Protein-A Sepharose CL-4B; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The protein A-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation to eliminate nonspecific complexes. The resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated by incubating overnight at 4 °C with 5 mg protein A-Sepharose and a polyclonal human angiotensinogen antibody (dilution 1:1000). The human angiotensinogen antibody, HCL, has been described elsewhere (7Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Leconte I. Cohen P. Simon D. Guyene T.T. Célérier J. Pau B. Corvol P. Clauser P. Jeunemaitre X. J.

Metab. 1984; 59: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The protein A-Sepharose was washed four times with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA buffer and then with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8. The antigen-antibody complex was dissociated by heating (4 min at 95 °C) in Laemmli buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). The [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled mutant proteins were resolved by 9% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was subjected to autoradiography. The absence of [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled intracellular proteins in nontransfected COS-7 was checked by the same procedure. The integrated optical density of each band on the autoradiographs was determined and analyzed using NIH Image, version 1.57 software with a set of 35S radiography standards. The standards were used to produce a calibration curve to convert the optical density values of each pixel of the digitized image into dpm of35S-labeled protein/mm2. The percentage of intracellular retention was calculated by dividing the densities at 6, 24, and 48 h by the densities immediately after the 10-min pulse (t0) for the wild-type and N-4 mutant protein. A COS cell supernatant containing the N-4 mutant protein was denatured by heating at 95 °C for 4 min in the presence of 0.1% (v/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. It was then incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at 37 °C with (i) no addition (mock treatment), (ii) 5 milliunits of neuraminidase (for 18 h), (iii) 5 milliunits of neuraminidase (for 1 h) followed by 2.5 milliunits ofO-glycosidase (for 18 h). Enzymatic deglycosylation was stopped by freezing. The samples were resolved by 9% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) by semidry transfer in 25 mm Tris/glycine buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% (v/v) SDS and 20% (v/v) methanol. Human angiotensinogen was detected with HCL antibody (dilution 1:6000). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by their alkaline phosphatase activity after biotin-streptavidin enhancement. Enzymatic parameters of the renin angiotensinogen reaction were determined using different concentrations of various glycosylated angiotensinogen mutant proteins and a fixed amount (20 pm) of recombinant human renin, which was provided by Hoffmann La Roche (Basel, Switzerland). Renin was produced as prorenin in CHO cells, purified, and activated to mature renin by Arg-C protease treatment as described by Mathews et al. (26Mathews S. Döbeli H. Pruschy M. Bosser R. D'Arcy A. Oefner C. Zulauf M. Gentz R. Breu V. Matile H. Schlaeger J. Fischli W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The active renin concentration used in this study was 150 μg/ml, as determined by a commercially available renin immunoradiometric assay (Diagnostics Pasteur, Marnes La Coquette, France). The same renin preparation was used in each experiment and diluted at 20 pm in a 100 mm citric acid/Na2HPO4, 3 mm EDTA buffer, pH 5.7. For the calculation of kinetic parameters, it was assumed that 100% of the mature renin was catalytically active. CHO cells producing wild-type and N14Q, N137Q, N271Q, N295Q, and N-4 mutant proteins were cultured in several 225-cm2 culture flasks for large scale (10–40 mg) production. Cells at 90–95% confluence were transferred to serum-free medium (UltraCHO, BioWhittaker), and supernatants were harvested every 3 or 4 days, filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane, and stored at −80 °C. For kinetic experiments, the supernatant was concentrated at 4 °C by ultrafiltration through a 10-kDa cut-off membrane (YM 10. Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) followed by centrifugation through a 30-kDa cut-off membrane (Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter; Millipore). Angiotensinogen concentration was determined in three ways: (i) direct radioimmunoassay of human angiotensinogen as described previously (24Genain C. Bouhnik J. Tewksbury D. Corvol P. Ménard J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); (ii) a two-monoclonal antibody (7B2/4G3) sandwich ELISA test, as described by Cohen et al. (18Cohen P.

We checked that each enzymatic assay was performed with a saturating renin concentration by increasing the renin concentration and the incubation time. These changes did not lead to an increase in the amount of Ang I peptide produced. We also checked that the angiotensinogen concentrations measured by direct radioimmunoassay and ELISA were not significantly different (±30%, according to the mutant) from those obtained with the enzymatic assay for each mutant. Various concentrations (0.05–10 μm) of each angiotensinogen substrate were incubated in 100 mm citric acid/Na2HPO4, 3 mm EDTA buffer, pH 5.7, with 20 pm purified recombinant human renin for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by raising the pH from 5.7 to 9.2 by adding 20 μl of 4 m Tris-base to each tube and chilling. The rate of Ang I production was determined in triplicate for each reaction mixture by a specific Ang I radioimmunoassay (27Ménard J. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1972; 90: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameter determinations were performed simultaneously for mutant and wild-type human angiotensinogen protein. Less than 10% of the substrate was consumed in each experiment. Various controls were performed. Each concentration of substrate was incubated in the same conditions but without renin to check that no Ang I was produced. Nontransfected CHO cells were transferred to serum-free medium. The supernatant was harvested, concentrated, and incubated with renin to check that no angiotensinogen or Ang I was produced by untransfected CHO cells. Supernatants containing either the wild-type human angiotensinogen or the N-4 mutant protein were incubated for 1 h at various temperatures between 4 and 80 °C. The incubation was stopped by chilling. The angiotensinogen concentration was determined before and after incubation by ELISA and enzymatic assay as described above. The wild-type hAGT cDNA and 11N-glycosylation mutant cDNAs were used to transfect COS-7 cells. The intracellular production of the human angiotensinogen proteins was studied by immunoprecipitation after metabolic labeling (Fig. 2 A), and extracellular secreted angiotensinogen was studied by Western blotting (Fig.2 B). The wild-type angiotensinogen protein had a complex and reproducible pattern in SDS-PAGE. Intracellular angiotensinogen gave five bands of 58, 55.5, 52, 50, and 48 kDa, the upper band (58 kDa) being the fully N-glycosylated protein. Angiotensinogen secreted into the medium gave a fuzzy band between 50 and 70 kDa. All of the single mutants lacked the upper intracellular band (58 kDa), and the heterogeneity (2–3 kDa) of secreted angiotensinogen was slightly less, suggesting that each potentialN-glycosylation site was actually glycosylated. The secreted N137Q single mutant had a different pattern in SDS-PAGE, because the polyclonal antibody did not detect the weakly glycosylated forms of this mutant. The heterogeneity of both intracellular and secreted angiotensinogens was significantly lower when at least three potentialN-glycosylation sites were mutated. Deglycosylation of one site gave a 55.5-kDa band, deglycosylation of two sites gave a 52-kDa band, and deglycosylation of three N-glycosylation sites a 50-kDa band in cells. In the medium, the size heterogeneity of secreted angiotensinogen progressively decreased as the number ofN-deglycosylated sites increased, although accurate molecular mass determination was difficult due to the fuzziness of the bands. The single 48-kDa band observed with the N-4 mutant protein was a fully N-deglycosylated form. Thus, there was a stepwise decrease in the heterogeneity of angiotensinogen, directly related to the number of deglycosylated sites. Analysis of triple mutants, in which only oneN-glycosylation site was conserved, showed that this site was N-glycosylated in each case. The metabolic labeling of each triple mutant detected two bands, the upper band (50 kDa) demonstrating N-glycosylation of the conserved site and the lower band (48 kDa) corresponding to the N-deglycosylated form of angiotensinogen. The intensity of the two bands was compared for each mutant to estimate the number of different oligosaccharide structures at each site. The Asn14-Lys15-Ser16 (137/271/295 mutant) and Asn271-Ser272-Thr273(14/137/295 mutant) sites were more glycosylated than the sites of the two other triple mutants, because the 50-kDa form was predominant. The Asn137-Cys138-Thr139 site was less glycosylated, because the two intracellular bands for triple mutant 14/271/295 were of similar intensity. The Asn295-Phe296-Ser297 C-terminal site was also less glycosylated because the deglycosylated form was predominant for the 14/137/271 mutant. The fully deglycosylated hAGT form (N-4) was correctly synthesized and secreted by COS-7 cells. Metabolic labeling detected a single intracellular band (48 kDa), and Western blot analysis detected two secreted bands: a major product of 48 kDa, in size identical to the intracellular band, and a minor 50-kDa band. Similar data were obtained with pure line CHO cells (data not shown). Western blot analysis showed that there was an extra N-4 mutant protein (50 kDa) secreted, which was not present in cells. Treatment with endoglycosidase F did not affect this pattern (data not shown), so we treated this form with neuraminidase alone or with neuraminidase followed by O-glycosidase. Neuraminidase treatment resolved recombinant N-deglycosylated angiotensinogen into a single 48-kDa band, which was not further affected by O-glycosidase treatment (Fig.3), demonstrating that the 50-kDa form contained only sialic acid residues. The 48-kDa form of the N-4 mutant protein produced in the medium was an entirely unglycosylated angiotensinogen with no O-glycosylation. The effect of N-glycosylation on cellular trafficking and secretion in the culture medium was studied by pulse-chase experiments in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Fig.4 A). All the mutant proteins were efficiently labeled within 10 min of the pulse (t= 0), giving the pattern shown in Fig. 2 A. The wild-type angiotensinogen and the four single mutant proteins were not detectable within cells after 6 h of chase (t = 6). Thus, the mutation of a single N-glycosylation site was not sufficient to affect cellular trafficking. However, a significant amount of the triple and quadruple mutant proteins was retained within the cells. After 24 h of chase (t = 24), it was still possible to immunoprecipitate radiolabeled triple mutant 14/137/271 protein from cells (the Asn295-Phe296-Ser297 N-glycosylation site was weakly glycosylated), whereas the other three triple mutant proteins were entirely secreted into the medium. A significant amount of the unglycosylated angiotensinogen (N-4 mutant) protein was retained in the cells after 6, 24 (Fig.4 A), and 48 h (data not shown) of chase. The amounts of wild-type and N-4 mutant proteins immunoprecipitated from cells are reported in Fig. 4 B. Pulse-chase experiments with a CHO cell line producing the N-4 mutant protein revealed a similar level of retention (15% retained within cells after 24 h of chase) (data not shown). The overall amount of the N-4 mutant protein produced was similar to the amount of the wild-type protein produced (15versus 18 μg/ml, respectively, corresponding to the 72-h production in serum-free medium for 30 × 106cells). The effect of the glycosylation of human angiotensinogen on its hydrolysis by renin was studied using the wild-type and several deglycosylated mutant proteins. The recombinant angiotensinogens were produced in milligram amounts by CHO cells, and the cell supernatants were incubated with 20 pm of pure recombinant human renin, at pH 5.7 for 1 h at 37 °C. The Michaelis-Menten representation for the N14Q, N137Q, N271Q, N295Q, N-4, and wild-type substrates is shown in Fig. 5. The Michaelis constant (Km), maximum velocity (Vmax), catalytic activity (kcat), and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) with renin of these proteins are reported in Table I.Table IKinetic constants for the hydrolysis of wild type and N-glycosylation mutants of human angiotensinogen by purified recombinant human reninSubstrateKmVmkcatkcat/Kmμmnmol Ang I · ml−1 · s−1s−1μm−1 · s−1Wild-type (a)1.7 ± 0.255 ± 3.52.8 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.1N14Q mutant (a)0.3 ± 0.016.2 ± 2.80.3 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.4N137Q mutant1.4542.71.9N271Q mutant1.34021.5N295Q mutant0.8281.41.7N-4 mutant (b)0.7 ± 0.162 ± 203.1 ± 15.0 ± 2Data are the means ± S.D. of two (a) or three (b) independent determinations.

Km andVm were determined using Lineweaver-Burk representation, and kcat values were obtained by multiplying Vm with renin concentration. The maximum velocity of the reaction with N14Q was 10 times lower than that observed with wild-type and other mutated substrates. However, its affinity for renin was 5 times higher than that of the wild-type, resulting in a catalytic efficiency similar to the wild-type kcat/Km. Thus, the asparagine residue at position 14 plays a key role in the kinetics of the renin-angiotensinogen reaction. In contrast, the kinetic parameters of the N137Q, N271Q, and N295Q hAGT substrates were quite similar to those of the wild-type protein, suggesting that the asparagine residues in positions 137, 271, and 295 had no significant effect on"
https://openalex.org/W2088228617,"The nuclear transcription factor c-Myb, which is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, has been shown to be functional in NIH 3T3 cells: cells that do not possess detectable levels of c-Myb. To identify endogenous target genes of c-Myb in fibroblasts, RNA isolated from NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with a full-length or a dominant negative c-<i>myb</i> construct (GREMyb and GREMEn, respectively) was subjected to differential display analysis. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends of a selected band, sequencing, and a nucleotide homology search led to the identification of thrombospondin 2 (TSP 2) as the gene product repressed in GREMyb and induced in GREMEn cells. The pattern of TSP 2 expression during the cell cycle was consistent with c-<i>myb</i>-dependent regulation. The possibility that the identified transcript was TSP 1, a homologous product known to be repressed by v-Src, c-Jun, and v-Myc, was ruled out by using a TSP 2-specific DNA probe and by showing a distinct pattern of regulation of TSP 1 and TSP 2 expression. Nuclear run-on and TSP 2 promoter-reporter (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) assays showed similar transcriptional levels in GREMyb and NIH 3T3 cells. However, mRNA stability studies showed a much shorter TSP 2 mRNA half-life in GREMyb compared with wild type NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that c-<i>myb</i> affects TSP 2 expression via a post-transcriptional mechanism. The implications of a protooncogene-mediated suppression of TSP expression are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2080245011,"Two forms of DNA polymerase II (epsilon) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pol II* and Pol II, were purified to near homogeneity from yeast cells. Pol II* is a four-subunit complex containing a 256-kDa catalytic polypeptide, whereas Pol II consists solely of a 145-kDa polypeptide derived from the N-terminal half of the 256-kDa polypeptide of Pol II*. We show that Pol II* and Pol II are indistinguishable with respect to the processivity and rate of DNA-chain elongation. The equilibrium dissociation constants of the complexes of Pol II* and Pol II with the DNA template showed that the stability of these complexes is almost the same. However, when the rates of dissociation of the Pol II* and Pol II from the DNA template were measured using single-stranded DNA as a trap for the dissociated polymerase, Pol II* dissociated 75-fold faster than Pol II. Furthermore, the rate of dissociation of Pol II* from the DNA template became faster as the concentration of the single-stranded DNA was increased. These results indicate that the rapid dissociation of Pol II* from the DNA template is actively promoted by single-stranded DNA. The dissociation of Pol II from the DNA template was also shown to be promoted by single-stranded DNA, although at a much slower rate. These results suggest that the site for sensing single-stranded DNA resides within the 145-kDa N-terminal portion of the catalytic subunit and that the efficiency for sensing single-stranded DNA by this site is positively modulated by either the C-terminal half of the catalytic subunit and/or the other subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2001818765,"Previous studies demonstrated that SFT (Stimulator of Fe Transport) facilitates both transferrin and nontransferrin-bound iron uptake in HeLa cells (Yu, J., and Wessling-Resnick, M.

Kyte-Doolittle analysis suggests that SFT has six transmembrane-spanning segments. This transport protein also displays an REXXE motif resembling domains involved in iron binding by ferritin and in iron uptake mediated by the yeast transporter Ftr1. Using N- and C-terminal epitope tags, we have identified that modification of either protein terminus does not interfere with SFT function in nontransferrin-bound iron uptake. The N- and C-terminal domains are intracellularly disposed since antibodies against these epitopes fail to recognize expressed proteins unless BHK cells are solubilized with detergents. To define the topology of two large extramembranous loop domains, anti-peptide antibodies were employed; anti-loop 4 antibodies show no immunoreactivity unless cells are permeabilized but anti-loop 5 antibodies recognize and bind surface SFT. Thus, loop 4 must be intracellular while loop 5 is extracellular. These topological studies situate the putative iron-binding REXXE domain on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. However, 55Fe-binding studies reveal that the ability of SFT to bind and mediate transport of extracellular iron is defective in mutants with Glu → Ala conversions in this motif. Curiously, we also find that depletion of intracellular iron by desferrioxamine impairs SFT transport and iron-binding functions.

Kyte-Doolittle analysis suggests that SFT is an intrinsic membrane protein with six bilayer-spanning domains (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J.

Using BHK cells stably expressing this transport protein with epitope tags, the topological disposition of the N and C termini of SFT, as well as the orientation of two large extramembranous loop domains, were defined in this investigation. The membrane topology of SFT predicts that the putative iron-binding REXXE domain resides within the cytoplasm. However, while SFT presents specific iron-binding sites on the BHK cell surface, mutants with Glu → Ala conversions in the REXXE domain lack extracellular iron-binding activity. The unexpected observation that depletion of cellular iron blocks SFT-mediated transport suggests that Glu83/Glu86 may bindintracellular iron to regulate SFT function and further indicates that membrane transport of iron mediated by SFT is itself an iron-dependent process. BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For transport assays, cells were grown to near confluence in 6-well (35-mm) plates. For Scatchard analysis and membrane topology studies, cells were cultured in 24-well (16-mm) plates. BHK cells were transfected using LipofectAMINETM as the DNA carrier (Life Technologies, Inc.); generation of stable cells with pGL2 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), pGL2-SFT (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), pGL2-SFT(Glu → Ala), or pEFtag-SFT was the same as described previously (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected BHK cells grown on coverslips were fixed and incubated with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml BSA, and either antibody against GFP (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:400 dilution or anti-HA antibody (Babco, Richmond, CA) at 1:600 dilution. After rinsing, cells were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of either anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate or anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (both from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). After copious washing, coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL) containing 2.5 mg/ml N-propyl gallate. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using an Axioskop epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) at a nominal magnification of × 100. PCR was performed using pBSK-SFT (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J.

The PCR product was digested withBamHI and XbaI and subcloned into pEFtag, a generous gift of Dr. A. Rao (7Luo C. Burgeon E. Carew J.A. McCaffrey P.G. Badalian T.M. Lane W.S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol.

Point mutagenesis to introduce alanines in place of Glu83 and Glu86 of SFT was as follows. Two complementary primers (5′-GTGCAGAGCATCCATCATGCGTTAAAAAAT and 5′-ATTTTTTAACGCATGGATTGCTCTGCAC) to introduce the alanine substitutions were employed in a PCR step with pGL2-SFT (1Gutierrez J.A.

The isolated fragments were then used as templates in a second PCR reaction with only the last two primers amplifying SFT ORF (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After digestion with EcoRI and NotI, the 1.1 kilobase pair product was subcloned into pGL2 vector. 55FeCl3was purchased from NEN Life Science Products (>3 mCi/mg) and [55Fe]nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) was prepared essentially as described by Teichmann and Stremmel (8Teichmann R.

Uptake assays were carried out by incubating cells with specified concentrations of55FeNTA in serum-free medium for the indicated time periods. Cells were lifted using PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, and cell-associated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting and normalized to protein content (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). BHK(GFP-SFT) and BHK(HA-SFT) grown in 24-well plates were washed with PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies or preimmune sera at desired dilutions in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. Specifically, BHK(GFP-SFT) cells were incubated with anti-GFP antibodies (1:500) (Molecular Probes), and BHK(HA-SFT) cells were incubated with anti-HA antibodies (1:500) (Babco), anti-L4 (1:250), anti-L5 (1:250), or preimmune sera (1:250). Generation of antisera against the two extramembranous loops of SFT, L4 and L5, was described previously (4Yu J. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6909-6915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After extensive washes with PBS, antibody binding was detected using 0.5 nm125I-labeled Protein A (NEN Life Sciences Products, specific activity >80 mCi/mg of protein); incubation was on ice for 60 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were lifted off the plates in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined in duplicate 200-μl samples by γ-counting. For some experiments, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 to detect intracellular immunoreactivity. Assay conditions to detect iron binding were as described previously (9Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. BHK cells were incubated with 55FeNTA in the presence or absence of 1000-fold excess unlabeled FeNTA for 1 h at 4 °C, washed once with PBS, then lifted with PBS containing 1 mmEDTA. Cell-associated radioactivity measured in the presence of unlabeled FeNTA was subtracted from equivalent samples incubated with55FeNTA alone to determine specific 55Fe binding. Binding affinity (Kd) and the number of iron-binding sites (Bmax) were determined by Scatchard analysis (11Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17805) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that a C-terminal chimera of SFT with GFP is localized to the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To identify potential alterations in the intracellular trafficking and targeting of N-terminally tagged SFT, immunofluorescence experiments were performed. Fig. 1 a shows that HA-SFT predominantly localizes to the juxtanuclear recycling endosomal compartment with rather diffuse distribution at cell surface. A similar pattern was observed for BHK cells expressing GFP-SFT (panel b), indicating that modification of the N or C termini of SFT does not interfere with its biosynthesis, membrane transport, and intracellular localization. While the epitope availability in RIA experiments described below suggests that SFT molecules are evenly divided between cell surface and intracellular compartments, its distribution within plasma membrane does not appear to provide a sufficiently intense signal for prominent staining. Similarly, Tf receptor staining is rather conspicuous in punctate vesicular compartments wherein protein is concentrated but not on the cell surface where it is known to reside (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To characterize the function of human SFT as an exogenously expressed protein and to compare the transport activities of N- and C-terminal chimeras of SFT, BHK cells stably expressing the GFP-SFT fusion protein, BHK(GFP-SFT), or SFT with two N-terminal HA tags, BHK(HA-SFT), were established. Fig. 2 shows the time course of non-Tf-bound Fe uptake for BHK(HA-SFT), BHK(GFP-SFT), and non-transfected control BHK cells. Time- and temperature-dependent uptake of 55Fe is observed; at 4 °C, less than 5% of radioactivity is found associated with cells compared with 55Fe internalized at 37 °C. GFP-SFT and HA-SFT stimulate 55Fe uptake 1.7-fold and 2.1-fold, respectively. The observation that BHK(HA-SFT) cells display ∼40% higher iron uptake activity is due to greater expression of HA-SFT (see below). To compare the kinetic determinants of non-Tf-bound Fe uptake by BHK(HA-SFT), BHK(GFP-SFT), and control BHK cells, initial rates of uptake were measured as a function of iron concentration. Double-reciprocal plots of these data are shown in Fig.3. Control BHK cells have an apparentKm for non-Tf-bound iron transport of 14.8 ± 3.4 μm (n = 3); this value is ∼2- to 3-fold greater than that determined for HeLa cells (4Yu J. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6909-6915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Sturrock A. Alexander J. Lamb J. Craven C.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3139-3145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, BHK cells expressing GFP-SFT or HA-SFT display lowerKm values of 5.2 ± 0.2 μm and 4.8 ± 0.3 μm, respectively (n = 3), consistent with the measured value of SFT-mediated uptake for HeLa cells (4Yu J. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6909-6915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). While control cells exhibit a Vmaxfor non-Tf-bound iron uptake of 7.5 ± 0.8 pmol/min/mg of protein, expression of SFT increases this kinetic parameter to 9.5 ± 0.8 and 13.6 ± 2.0 pmol/min/mg protein for BHK(GFP-SFT) and BHK(HA-SFT) cells, respectively. Again, these observations are consistent with the idea that more iron transporters are expressed in the latter cell line.Figure 3Kinetic analysis of iron uptake mediated by SFT. BHK(HA-SFT) (circles), BHK(GFP-SFT) (triangles), and control BHK cells (squares) were incubated with different concentrations of 55FeNTA for 10 min. Iron uptake measurements were carried out as detailed for Fig. 1. The difference between values obtained at 37 and 4 °C was taken as specific 55Fe transport. Shown is the double-reciprocal plot of data from a single experiment (±S.E.) representative of four independent experiments. Initial rate of uptake,V0 (pmol of 55Fe/min/mg of protein), is shown as a function of [Fe] (μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kyte-Doolittle analysis predicts that SFT is an integral membrane protein with six transmembranous segments (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A hypothetical model for SFT topology is presented in Fig. 4 A. To confirm this topological arrangement, antibodies were raised against SFT-GST fusion peptides containing residues Glu149-Met224 and His246-Leu296, representing the integral membrane protein's extramembranous loops L4 and L5, respectively. Previous work has shown that anti-L4 antibody recognizes SFT and SFT-GFP by Western blot analysis (4Yu J. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6909-6915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); similar results were obtained for anti-L5 antibody (not shown). As shown in Fig. 4 B, preimmune antisera showed little reactivity against BHK(HA-SFT) cells. Anti-HA and anti-L4 recognize and bind to these cells, but only upon permeabilization (solid bars). In contrast, anti-L5 binds to the surface of nonpermeabilized cells (open bars), and more immunoreactivity is observed upon addition of detergents (solid bars) due to solubilization of endosomal compartments and detection of intracellular SFT. Thus, the L5 domain appears to be extracellularly situated, while L4 and the N terminus of SFT are occluded from antibody in the absence of detergent, indicating their cytoplasmic orientation. The enhancement in L5 antibody binding upon the addition of detergent further supports the endosomal localization of SFT (Fig. 1) and suggests that the protein is roughly distributed in equal amounts between the cell surface and the intracellular compartments. To examine the orientation of the C-terminal domain, experiments were performed with BHK(GFP-SFT) cells, and anti-GFP immunoreactivity was assessed. 125I-Labeled Protein A binding is detected only upon permeabilization, placing the C terminus within the cell cytoplasm. Notably, the total amount of SFT is lower in these cells. BHK(GFP-SFT) cells have 32% lower cell surface immunoreactivity than BHK(HA-SFT) as detected by anti-L5 (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that more transporters are expressed at plasma membrane in the BHK(HA-SFT) cells (see Figs. 2 and 3). Anti-peptide antisera had negligible immunoreactivity in control BHK cells or cells stably expressing cytosolic GFP alone (see Fig.5 B), indicating that endogenous rodent SFT, if expressed, cannot be recognized by these antibodies. Thus, these data confirm the predicted topology of SFT (Fig. 4 A). Although direct evidence to support the intracellular placement of the REXXE domain is lacking, the overall hydrophobicity of the M1 to M3 region (∼64%), the number of charged residues within this motif (4 of 5 amino acids), and the observation that the protein is inserted into membranes cotranslationally (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) support the conclusion that this putative iron-binding domain is situated on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. Crystal structure analysis has implicated a role for REXXE motifs in iron binding by ferritin (6Trikha J. Theil E.C. Allwell N.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 949-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, the REXXE motif of the yeast Ftr1 iron transporter has been shown to play an important functional role (5Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that mutation of the two glutamic acid residues within the SFT domain eliminates its ability to mediate iron uptake in Xenopus oocytes (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To study how this motif may affect SFT-mediated transport in mammalian cells, stable BHK cells were established expressing Glu → Ala point mutations in the GFP-SFT chimera. As shown in Fig. 5 A, antibody-binding experiments demonstrate that nearly equal numbers of SFT molecules are expressed on the surface of BHK(GFP-SFT) and BHK(GFP-SFTGlu → Ala) cells as detected by anti-L5 binding. As a control, anti-L5 binding BHK(GL2) cells was measured and found to be negligible (<25 cpm/μg of protein). These results indicate that the biosynthesis, membrane trafficking, and cell surface expression of the mutant is unaffected. This idea is confirmed by the immunofluorescence data presented in Fig.1 demonstrating that the cellular distribution of GFP-SFTGlu → Ala is identical to wild-type (compare panel c to panels a and b). Fig.5 B compares the time course of non-Tf-iron uptake by BHK(GFP-SFT) and BHK(GFP-SFTGlu → Ala) and demonstrates that although GFP-SFT (circles) stimulates Fe uptake, Glu → Ala mutations within the REXXE domain impair this transport activity. The transport activity of BHK(GFP-SFTGlu → Ala) cells is nearly the same as that measured for the control. The failure of the mutant to stimulate iron transport is consistent with results observed when its expression was studied inXenopus oocytes (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and further identifies that Glu83 and/or Glu86 are critical residues for SFT transport function rather than its biosynthesis and trafficking. To examine the ability of SFT to bind iron and to determine whether the two glutamic acid residues are involved in this activity, the association of 55Fe with the membrane surface of BHK(GL2), BHK(GFP-SFT), and BHK(GFP-SFTGlu → Ala) cells was measured. As shown in Fig. 6, saturable55Fe binding is observed for control BHK(GL2) cells. Similar activity is detected for BHK(GFP-SFTGlu → Ala) cells, but BHK(GFP-SFT) cells show enhanced surface 55Fe binding. Scatchard analysis (Fig. 7) reveals a single class of binding sites (1.1 × 107/cell) with a Kd of 5.9 ± 1.0 μm determined for BHK(GFP-SFT) cells (n = 3). This value is quite comparable to the apparentKm of transport associated with SFT function which is ∼5 μm (Fig. 3). In contrast, BHK(GFP-SFTGlu → Ala) and BHK(GL2) cells have limited binding sites (∼7 × 106/cell), with a Kd of 12.3 ± 2.1 μm and 15.7 ± 3.1 μm, respectively (n = 3). The latter results suggest that Glu83 and Glu86 are critical not only for iron transport, but also for the apparent iron-binding activity of SFT. Given that the topological data described above contradict the idea that the REXXE domain would be extracellularly disposed and thus capable of binding 55Fe, a simple explanation for the failure of the mutant to bind iron is that protein folding might be perturbed. To examine whether Glu → Ala mutations impair SFT function by disrupting its membrane topology, experiments were performed to determine the orientations of L4, L5, and the C-terminal domain. Fig.8 shows that anti-GFP and anti-L4 only bind to the BHK cells stably expressing GFP-SFTGlu → Alaupon solubilization, while anti-L5 binding is detected for both intact and permeabilized cells, consistent with wild type membrane topology.Figure 7Scatchard analysis of iron binding by SFT.

Modified RIA experiments were performed essentially as described for Fig. 4. BHK(GFP-SFTGlu → Ala) cells were incubated with anti-GFP, anti-HA, anti-L4, anti-L5, or preimmune serum in PBS and cell-associated antibody was measured by125I-labeled protein A binding. Solid bars are data for cells permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further explore the role of the intracellular REXXE motif, the iron content of BHK cells was depleted by overnight incubation with 50 μm desferrioxamine. 55Fe uptake assays were then performed to compare the activities of control and iron-depleted BHK(GFP-SFT), BHK(GFP-SFTGlu → Ala), and BHK(GL2) cells. As shown in Fig.9 A, 55Fe uptake was unaffected in control BHK(GL2) and BHK(GFP-SFTGlu → Ala) cells upon iron depletion, consistent with observations made for fibroblasts (14Kaplan J. Jordan I. Sturrock A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Although expression of wild type SFT stimulates iron import nearly 2-fold over control, treatment with desferrioxamine (solid bars) blocks SFT-mediated transport activity, suggesting that the transport function of SFT is iron-dependent. Incubation of BHK(GFP-SFT) cells with 65 μm FeNTA for 2 h after desferrioxamine treatment completely restored SFT activity (not shown). Moreover, Fig.9 B shows that iron depletion does not result in lower cell surface 125I-labeled protein A binding as detected by anti-L5, although surface 55Fe binding is reduced ∼50%. Thus, effects of iron depletion are reversible and are not accounted for by an iron-dependent decrease of cell surface SFT. When exogenously expressed in BHK cells, SFT stimulates non-Tf-bound iron uptake with properties essentially the same as described for HeLa cells (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The previously reportedKm (∼5 μm) is nearly identical to values determined for BHK(GFP-SFT) and BHK(HA-SFT) cells by our initial rate analysis. However, unlike HeLa cells which have an endogenous pool of SFT (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), BHK cells appear to have an uptake system with different properties (Km ∼15 μm). Complex kinetics of iron uptake suggesting the presence of two transport mechanisms in BHK(GFP-SFT) or BHK(HA-SFT) cells are not observed in our study. Although one interpretation is that Lineweaver-Burk analysis may not be powerful enough to reveal the existence of multiple uptake mechanisms under our experimental conditions, it should be noted that the possibility that SFT modulates the activity of endogenous BHK cell transporters cannot be excluded. However, the findings that the biosynthesis, membrane trafficking, and transport characteristics of this protein are identical whether expressed in rodent or human cells lend support to the idea that SFT function does not require other protein cofactors. These observations are in contrast to theSaccharomyces cerevisiae transporter Ftr1, which requires Fet3 for proper function (12Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); moreover, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog (Fip1) of Ftr1 cannot complementftr1 − cells unless the S. pombehomolog of Fet3 (Fio1) is co-expressed (12Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, we might tentatively conclude that SFT acts as a direct transport facilitator for iron, although rigorous reconstitution experiments will be necessary to confirm its activity. Previous primary structure analysis predicted SFT to be a hydrophobic protein with six transmembranous domains (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the N and C terminally tagged SFT constructs and anti-peptide antibodies, we have confirmed the topology suggested by Kyte-Doolittle analysis (Fig.4 A). This model situates the putative iron-binding REXXE motif on an intracellular domain. However, Glu → Ala mutations in this domain block SFT-mediated iron binding and translocation at the cell surface. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicates that these mutations do not interfere with biosynthesis and targeting of SFT (Fig. 1), and loss of function for mutant SFT is not due to lower amounts of expressed protein at the cell surface (Fig.5 A). In addition, Glu → Ala mutations do not alter the topological arrangements of L4, L5, and the C terminus (Fig. 8), such that incorrect membrane folding is unlikely to account for failure of SFT mutant to bind and take up iron. An unexpected and interesting observation in our study is that SFT-mediated transport activity is dependent on intracellular iron status. Based on this finding and features of the Glu → Ala mutant, we speculate that the L2 domain of SFT acts as a “sensor” to monitor cellular iron status. The dependence of SFT function on iron must occur at a post-translational level, because the activity of exogenously expressed protein appears to be exclusively affected. Moreover, the fact that this effect is fully reversed by brief incubation of cells with iron suggests that SFT may directly bind the cation. Thus, the REXXE motif domain may act to bind cytosolic “free” iron to maintain SFT in a conformation competent for binding and transport of extracellular iron. Since loss of the ability to sense intracellular levels of iron could result in excessive iron accumulation due to unchecked SFT activity, the failure of the Glu → Ala mutant to bind iron may provide a feedback signal that blocks iron uptake. Thus, we propose that the glutamic acids of the L2 region of SFT not only bind iron but serve as a sensory domain to regulate SFT activity. The envisioned sensor mechanism predicts that when the intracellular free iron level rises, SFT-mediated transport is diminished due to interaction at the REXXE site. It is known, for example, that increased cellular iron content decreases Tf receptor number to limit iron import under these conditions. However, unlike the effects observed for SFT function, iron chelation up-regulates Tf receptor expression. Although SFT can stimulate Tf-mediated iron uptake (1Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Revira S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we have yet to determine whether intracellular iron status influences SFT function in this pathway. Because iron depletion appears to enhance Tf receptor number, our results may suggest that SFT function in Tf-mediated uptake is differentially regulated from that of Nramp2, which has also been implicated recently to play a role in endosomal transport (16Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick M.L. Garrick M.D. Andrews N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) and which appears to be up-regulated in response to diminished iron levels (2Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 338: 482-487Crossref Scopus (2667) Google Scholar). Post-translational effects of iron on non-Tf-mediated uptake have been reported previously (14Kaplan J. Jordan I. Sturrock A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 15Basset P. Quesneau Y. Zwiller J. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1644-1647PubMed Google Scholar). In the studies of fibroblasts, HeLa, CHO, Hep-G2, and L-cells, increased levels of extracellular iron were found to increase iron assimilation (14Kaplan J. Jordan I. Sturrock A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 15Basset P. Quesneau Y. Zwiller J. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1644-1647PubMed Google Scholar). Kaplan and co-workers hypothesized that this enhanced uptake was due to the recruitment of cryptic intracellular iron transporters to the cell surface, an idea supported by the enhanced Vmax observed under these conditions. In our study, cell surface SFT numbers do not change upon iron depletion, but further experiments are required to study the influence of high levels of cytosolic iron on the function and distribution of SFT. Our investigation, however, raises critical questions regarding the regulation of SFT function by cellular iron status and provides the basis for future analysis of regulatory domains. A key to understanding SFT structure-function relationships will be the ultimate identification of the extracellular iron-binding and transport site that appears to be influenced by the intracellular REXXE domain."

An obvious function of chromatin structure is to bring about the ordered compaction of DNA within the nucleus.

Promoter mapping experiments have shown that in many instances cognate DNA elements of critical transcription factors are located precisely in the linker region between positioned nucleosomes (5Hayes J.J.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 96-104Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Some DNA binding factors such as the glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone receptors can make DNA contacts apparently compatible with core histone-DNA interactions and are thus able to bind to DNA on the surface of the nucleosome (15Li Q. Wrange O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 96-104Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell.

However, in general the affinities of such trans-acting factors such as TFIIIA, TBP, or Gal4 for their cognate DNA sequences are reduced by several orders of magnitude when the target sequences are associated with the core histone octamer (5Hayes J.J.

Biol. 1996; 258: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that this restrictive influence is modeled by a set of linked equilibria in which histones and DNA binding factors compete for binding to the same DNA. Their quantitative analysis shows that histone competition is most severe near the center of the particle and decreases as one moves toward the “edge” of the nucleosome core region. However, the full extent of the repressive influence of a single nucleosome core has not been accurately determined. The reach of restrictive histone-DNA interactions is generally considered to be equivalent to ∼146 base pairs, the amount of DNA within the nucleosome core region. However, the nucleosome core particle DNA is defined by protection from the endo- and exo-nucleolytic activities of micrococcal nuclease digestion, not DNA binding of trans-acting factors. In the present paper, we examined the extent of influence of core histone-DNA interactions within a single nucleosome core on the binding of the transcription factor, TFIIIA. We show that the entire cognate element for TFIIIA must be moved well beyond the edge of the nucleosome core region to recover high affinity binding by this factor. The results suggest that histone-DNA interactions 15–20 base pairs beyond the edge of the nucleosome core region have significant consequences that may be relevant for the activation of 5 S RNA genes in vivo. TheHpaII–XbaI fragment flanked by asymmetricBstXI linkers from pJHXI-BstXI, which contains the Xenopus borealis somatic 5 S RNA gene (22Hayes J.J. Lee K.-M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was prepared and modified by standard three- and four-primer polymerase chain reaction methods. The primers were designed to modify the 5 S DNA fragment to obtain inserts of 5–35 base pairs in increments of 5 bp between positions +50 and +51 (with respect to the transcription start nucleotide of 5 S RNA gene, +1). Inserts were designed as tandem repeats of the wt sequence such that the +5 insertion resulted in uninterrupted 5 S sequence from −102 to +55 appended to sequences +51 to +132; the +10 construct has uninterrupted 5 S DNA from −102 to +60 appended to sequences +51 to +132, and so on. A fragment containing a 20-base pair insert was not obtained because of the inability to be propagated in bacterial cells. The modified fragments were then restricted with BstXI and cloned into pBSIIsk(+) (Stratagene). The HpaII-XbaI fragments were radiolabeled at the 5′ end of either strand with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP by standard methods. Nucleosome cores were reconstituted onto radiolabeled DNA fragments either by exchange with stripped chromatin or by dialysis from high salt with purified chicken erythrocyte histones (22Hayes J.J. Lee K.-M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Under no circumstances did we detect differences in results due to the reconstitution methodology employed. In the histone exchange method, a large molar excess (∼50-fold) of stripped chromatin was mixed with radiolabeled DNA, and NaCl concentration was adjusted to 1 m. The mix was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The salt concentration was then diluted to 0.8, 0.6, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 m NaCl by adding 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For the salt dialysis method, nonspecific carrier DNA (∼10 μg), radiolabeled DNA (∼0.25 μg), and purified core histones (mass ratio histone/DNA ∼0.8) were mixed in a total volume of 200 μl in 2.0 m NaCl. The sample was dialyzed for at least 1.5 h against several buffers containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and decreasing NaCl concentrations of 1.2, 1.0, 0.8, and 0.6 m. A final dialysis was performed for 12 h against 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. After reconstitution, only naked DNA, (H3/H4)2 tetramer-DNA complexes and nucleosomes were detectable by nucleoprotein gel electrophoresis. HpaII-XbaI DNA fragments were internally labeled at the BbvI site as described (23Ura K. Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27171-27174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleosomes or (H3/H4)2 tetramer-DNA complexes were reconstituted as described and then digested for 5 min at room temperature with 0.75, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 unit of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington). Ca2+ concentration was adjusted to 0.5 mm concomitantly with addition of micrococcal nuclease. Digestion was terminated with addition of EDTA and SDS. The DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and resolved by electrophoresis in non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. DNA fragments of 147 bp were gel-extracted and restricted with EcoRV to map the termini of the micrococcal nuclease digestion products (24Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The digestion products were then resolved by electrophoresis in denaturing gels (25Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 314-330Google Scholar). DNA fragments were end-labeled either at the HpaII site or at theXbaI site. Nucleosome cores reconstituted ontoHpaII-XbaI-labeled fragments were treated with hydroxyl radicals as described, and reactions were quenched with the addition of glycerol to a final concentration of 5% (22Hayes J.J. Lee K.-M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Samples were then directly loaded onto preparative 0.7% agarose gels and electrophoresed for 1.5–2 h at 120 V. Radiolabeled bands were identified by autoradiography of the wet gel; DNA was recovered from the gel and analyzed by denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (25Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 314-330Google Scholar). Specific DNA markers were produced by Maxam-Gilbert cleavage at guanine Gases. The7 S storage particle and TFIIIA were purified as described by Smith et al. (26Smith D.R. Jackson I.J. Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, immature ovary homogenate was fractionated on glycerol gradients, bound to DEAE-cellulose, and eluted on a salt gradient. The7 S particle fractions (1–10 mg of protein) were adjusted to 0.1 m KCl in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ZnCl2, 20% glycerol (buffer A). RNase A was mixed with7 S particle (50 mg of RNase A per mg of protein starting material), incubated for 5 min, and then mixed with an equal volume of buffer A containing 0.1m KCl and 10 m urea. The mixture was loaded onto a Bio-Rex 70 column, and TFIIIA was eluted with increasing concentrations of KCl. TFIIIA was eluted between 0.8 and 1m KCl. The protein was >95% pure (26Smith D.R. Jackson I.J. Brown D.D. Cell. 1984; 37: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For mobility shift experiments, 5 μl of the reconstituted histone-DNA complexes (∼250 ng of total DNA; ∼25 fmol of total 5 S DNA) were incubated with various amounts of purified TFIIIA in 10 μl of binding buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 70 mm NH4Cl, 7 mmMgCl2,10 mm ZnCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 20 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml) for 1 h at 23 °C. Samples were loaded directly onto 0.7% agarose gels containing 0.5× TB buffer (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3) while the gel was running at 120 V. EDTA was omitted from all solutions (24Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have used hydroxyl radical footprinting to reveal the precise location of histone-DNA interactions within a well positioned nucleosome assembled on a DNA fragment containing a 5 S RNA gene fromX. borealis (Fig. 1) (27Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the assembly of this DNA fragment into a nucleosome prevents binding of the 5 S-specific transcription factor TFIIIA to the internal promoter of the 5 S gene (18Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 90: 6415-6419Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As previously reported, histone-DNA interactions can be detected well beyond the edge of the nucleosome core region located between positions −70 and +79 as defined by micrococcal nuclease digestion (18Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 90: 6415-6419Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 27Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Importantly, these contacts extend through the entire internal promoter and include the crucial +80 to +92 region necessary and sufficient for TFIIIA binding (Fig. 1) (28Sakonju S. Brown D.D. Cell. 1982; 31: 395-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Liao X. Clemens K.R. Tennant T. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 857-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To assess more accurately the significance of these histone-DNA interactions with regard to TFIIIA binding, we designed constructs to gradually move the TFIIIA-binding site away from the positioned nucleosome. To obtain the constructs needed for this study, it was first necessary to locate the DNA element that drives sequence-dependent positioning of the histone octamer. Sequence-dependent conformational variations in B-DNA structure such as variation in minor groove width are reflected in the hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns of naked DNA (30Tullius T.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 297-300Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Burkhoff A.M. Tullius T.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 935-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern of nakedXenopus 5 S DNA contains regions of strikingly periodic and uniform modulation (Fig. 1), reminiscent of the cleavage pattern obtained with stably curved DNA sequences (31Burkhoff A.M. Tullius T.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 935-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 32Hayes J.J. Bashkin J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8434-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Such DNA structures have been shown to efficiently direct nucleosome positioning (31Burkhoff A.M. Tullius T.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 935-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 33Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Importantly, quantitative densitometry clearly shows that these periodic cleavage modulations directly align with the much larger modulations within the hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern of 5 S DNA assembled into a nucleosome (Fig. 2). Thus, a discrete region within the 5 S DNA has a conformation that yields a hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern similar in nature, but not in magnitude, to the severely curved DNA found within the nucleosome. In addition, the position of this element corresponds to the approximate intranucleosomal location of positioning elements identified by mutational and deletion analysis (34FitzGerald P.C. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15318-15324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ramsay N. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our interpretation is that the hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern of naked 5 S DNA allows the identification of sequence-dependent DNA structure likely to function as the nucleosome positioning element within the 5 S DNA fragment (Fig. 2). The putative nucleosome positioning element we identified is located approximately between positions −30 to +50 within the 5 S DNA sequence. This element abuts the TFIIIA-binding site within the internal promoter region located approximately from +50 to +95 (Fig. 2) (28Sakonju S. Brown D.D. Cell. 1982; 31: 395-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, we designed constructions of the 5 S DNA fragment to gradually separate the TFIIIA and nucleosome-binding sites by placing insertions between nucleotides +50/+51 (Fig.3). Modified 5 S DNAs were obtained by standard polymerase chain reaction methods. The length of the inserts was increased in increments of 5 bp to a maximum of 35 bp, except that a plasmid bearing an insert of +20 bp could not be propagated in bacterial cells (Fig. 3). Inserts were designed as tandem repeats of the original sequence in order to provide as little disruption of the 5 S sequence as possible (see “Experimental Procedures”). We first analyzed if the insertions had any effect on the formation or positioning of nucleosomes reconstituted in vitro. Reconstitutions were carried out such that about 50% of the labeled nucleoprotein complexes were (H3/H4)2 tetramer-DNA complexes, and the other 50% were nucleosomes (Fig.4). The presence of both complexes was desired in order to provide an internal nucleoprotein control for TFIIIA binding (see below). The identity of each nucleoprotein complex was confirmed by co-migration of purified reconstituted tetramer or octamer in agarose gels (data not shown; see Ref. 22Hayes J.J. Lee K.-M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We next determined the position of the nucleosomes on our 5 S DNA constructs by mapping the limits of the 146-base pair nucleosome core DNA produced during micrococcal nuclease digestion. Micrococcal nuclease digestion was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the DNA products were resolved on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 5). In agreement with the nucleoprotein gel, all constructs were efficiently reconstituted into canonical nucleosomes as evidenced by the production of the146-bp nucleosome core particle DNA during micrococcal digestion.Figure 5Micrococcal nuclease digestion of reconstituted nucleosome cores. Nucleosomes cores were reconstituted with internally labeled 5 S DNA and were digested with micrococcal nuclease, and products of digestion were then analyzed non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, as indicated. In each setlane M is a MspI digestion of pBR322 marker, andlanes 1–4 contain products from complexes digested with 0.75, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 units of micrococcal nuclease (seetriangle above lanes). The digestion product corresponding to the nucleosome core DNA (146 bp) is indicated (arrow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The precise position of the nucleosome was determined by recovering the 146-bp DNA from the gel, cleavage with EcoRV at position +31 within 5 S DNA, and analyzing the products on a sequencing gel (Fig.6). Note that because the DNA is labeled internally at position −23, only one of the two fragments produced byEcoRV digestion of the nucleosome core DNA will be observed (see “Experimental Procedures”). The digestion products indicate that all constructs have nucleosome positioning identical to the unmodified wt fragment. Specifically, two major bands are observed of ∼100 and 130 nucleotides in length (Fig. 6 A). The ∼100-nucleotide band corresponds to the major nucleosome position mapped previously on the wt 5 S DNA fragment (23Ura K. Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27171-27174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The 130-bp band was unexpected based on earlier mapping studies of octamer-5 S DNA complexes (18Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 90: 6415-6419Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Since an octamer located at this position would be expected to bind TFIIIA even on the wt 5 S DNA construct (see below), we next determined whether this band might be due to the tetramer-DNA complexes present within the reconstitutions. We therefore carried out a reconstitution with only the (H3/H4)2 tetramer and the wt 5 S fragment. Micrococcal nuclease digestion of these complexes yields two predominant double-stranded DNA products of about 100 and 146 bp in length (data not shown). Interestingly, EcoRV digestion and analysis of the 146-bp product reveals that only bands ∼130 bp in length are produced (Fig. 6 A, lanes 8). One explanation for this result is that this 146-base pair product is an intermediate formed during micrococcal digestion of tetramer-DNA complexes in which trimming has occurred only on the downstream end of the complex. In this case, the predicted position of the downstream edge of the tetramer would be exactly coincident with the position previously mapped in footprinting experiments (24Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the data indicate that the presence of the inserts does not alter the position of the nucleosome with respect to the nucleosome positioning element among the 5 S DNA fragments (Fig. 6 B). We next carried out hydroxyl radical footprinting of the different nucleosome constructs to confirm the mapping results and to obtain a more accurate assessment of the location of histone-DNA interactions (27Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Complexes were prepared with DNAs containing a radioactive end label on either strand, cleaved with hydroxyl radicals, and the nucleosomes resolved on a preparative nucleoprotein gels. The DNA products were purified and analyzed on sequencing gels (Fig.7). As evident when the DNA was radioactively labeled at the downstream end of the 5 S fragment, the insertions had the effect of moving the nucleosome footprint progressively further away, by discrete 5-bp increments, from the TFIIIA-binding site (Fig. 7). Conversely, when the label was incorporated at the upstream end of the 5 S DNA fragments, all nucleosome footprints occurred at the same position with respect to the end of the fragment containing the nucleosome positioning element and were qualitatively identical to that observed on the wt fragment (results not shown; see Fig. 1). The above results indicate that the nucleosome is present at the same location with respect to the nucleosome positioning element in every construct, and thus histone-DNA interactions are gradually retracted from the TFIIIA-binding site in a 3′-5′ direction. To determine the effect on 5 S promoter accessibility, we performed nucleoprotein gel shift assays. Complexes reconstituted on each of the 5 S constructs were incubated with increasing amounts of purified TFIIIA in binding buffer, and the resulting products were resolved in agarose gels. As the TFIIIA concentration increased, the intensity of the free DNA band for each construct was reduced, and a new band corresponding to TFIIIA·DNA complex appeared (Fig. 8). Importantly, quantitative titrations with the naked DNA fragments alone showed that the TFIIIA binding affinity was identical for all 5 S constructs (results not shown). Thus, the mid-point in the titration for TFIIIA binding to the naked DNAs in the nucleoprotein experiments occurred when the free concentration of active TFIIIA was ∼1 × 10–9m and was used as an internal reference (36Romaniuk P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17593-17600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Del Rio S. Setzer D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By using the naked DNAs as a reference, an approximate relative dissociation constant for TFIIIA binding to all nucleoprotein complexes was determined by quantitative densitometry with corrections for residual densities of products and reactants on gels such as are shown in Fig. 8 (38Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 132-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). As expected, we observed TFIIIA binding to tetramer-DNA complexes in all cases (18Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 90: 6415-6419Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, in the case of tetramers assembled with the wt 5 S DNA fragment, the affinity of TFIIIA was reduced approximately 4-fold relative to the affinity of TFIIIA for naked 5 S DNA (Table I). Likewise, the affinity of TFIIIA for the +5, the +10, and the +15 complexes was similarly reduced compared with the naked DNA. However, we found that TFIIIA binding affinities for the +25-tetramer complex and the remaining complexes were approximately equivalent to that of the naked 5 S DNA (Table I).Table IRelative TFIIIA dissociation constantsInsert lengthNaked 5 S DNATetramer-DNAOctamer-DNAbp013–4>50–100513–4>50–1001012–3>50–1001512–3>50–1002511>50–1003011∼535113–4 Open table in a new tab A much different situation was found for TFIIIA binding to 5 S DNA assembled into a complete nucleosome. No binding was detected for reconstitutions on the wt, +5, +10, +15, and +25 templates (see nucleosome band, Fig. 8). In these cases we estimate the affinity of TFIIIA to be reduced at least 50–100-fold relative to naked 5 S DNA. However, some binding is detected for nucleosomes reconstituted on the +30 construct, and a complete shift of the nucleosome band is observed for the +35 construct (Fig. 8). Densitometric analysis indicated that the relative binding affinities of TFIIIA for the +30 and +35 nucleosomes to be approximately 5- and 3–4-fold lower than that of the naked 5 S DNA, respectively (Table I). We have tested if histone-DNA interactions outside of the classically defined nucleosome core region can significantly modulate the binding of a eukaryotic transcription factor, TFIIIA. This protein has a modular structure, with nine individually folded zinc finger domains (2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar). These nine fingers are combined into three distinct structural domains containing fingers 1–3, 4–6, and 7–9 (39Clemens K.R. Liao X. Wolf V. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10822-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 40Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Previous work with truncated forms of TFIIIA revealed that 90% of the binding free energy is contributed by interaction of the first three fingers of this protein with 5 S sequences between +80 and +92 in the 5 S gene (28Sakonju S. Brown D.D. Cell. 1982; 31: 395-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Liao X. Clemens K.R. Tennant T. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 857-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, a polypeptide containing fingers 1–3 binds DNA with an affinity only 3–4-fold less than the intact protein. About half of the remaining stability is contributed by finger 5 and half by fingers 7–9 (41Clemens K.R. Zhang P. Liao X. McBryant S.J. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 224: 23-35Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, blockage of the binding of fingers 4–9 would cause a loss in affinity of only about 3-fold. In the case of (H3/H4)2 tetramer·wt 5 S DNA complex, we observe a relative affinity of TFIIIA that is ∼3–4-fold less than that of naked 5 S DNA. Our interpretation is that H3/H4 tetramer-DNA contacts in this complex restrict the interaction of fingers 4–9 with 5 S DNA while not interfering with the binding of fingers 1–3 (Fig.9). This hypothesis is supported by hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments that show that H3/H4 tetramer-DNA contacts extend to about position +75 within the 5 S sequence. Thus these contacts completely overlap the binding sites of fingers 4–9, while leaving exposed the region +80 to +92 which is contacted by fingers 1–3 (18Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 90: 6415-6419Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Liao X. Clemens K.R. Tennant T. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 857-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 39Clemens K.R. Liao X. Wolf V. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10822-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, DNase I footprinting of tetramer·wt 5 S DNA·TFIIIA triple complexes suggests that whereas fingers 1–3 are bound to their cognate sequences, the remaining fingers may not be bound to the DNA in a manner analogous to their interaction within the naked 5 S DNA·TFIIIA complex (19Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The binding data for all 5 S constructs suggest that tetramer complexes formed on the +5, +10, and +15 5 S fragments all behave in a way qualitatively similar to the wt complex (Fig. 9). Thus, the tetramer complex must be “moved” 15–20 base pairs further away from the TFIIIA-binding site before all nine zinc fingers of the protein can freely bind DNA. The results indicate that the binding site for fingers 1–3 is blocked when the wt 5 S DNA fragment is assembled into a nucleosome (Figs. 8and 9). These histone-DNA contacts cause the affinity of TFIIIA to be reduced >50–100-fold. Interestingly, we find that the nucleosome must be moved over 30 base pairs further away from the TFIIIA-binding site before detectable high affinity binding is restored. However, in this case the relative affinity of TFIIIA for the +30 and +35 nucleosomes suggests that only fingers 1–3 are able to specifically interact with DNA within these complexes (Table I). This hypothesis will be tested in future experiments using hydroxyl radical footprinting to precisely map protein-DNA contacts in the +35 nucleosome·TFIIIA triple complex. Thus the data indicate that the crucial +80 to +92 sequences must be moved approximately 90–100 base pairs away from the dyad axis of the nucleosome before fingers 1–3 can freely bind this region (Fig. 9). Clearly, histone-DNA contacts, or at least the presence of the core histones, can moderate the binding activity of elements well beyond the edge of the enzymatically defined 146-bp nucleosome core region. The present results are in good agreement with a very recent demonstration of the dependence of TFIIIA binding on the translational position of a nucleosome on the X. laevis somatic 5 S RNA gene (42Howe L. Ausio J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this paper, most of the reconstituted 5 S constructs containing multiple translational positions were unable to bind TFIIIA. However, one construct in which the nucleosome was positioned just upstream of the internal promoter region did bind TFIIIA but only at concentrations much higher than that required to fully load the naked 5 S DNA (the data presented do not allow a more accurate assessment of the relative dissociation constants of TFIIIA for nucleosomal and naked DNA). A previous quantitative analysis of the effects of histone-DNA interactions within the nucleosome core region concluded that these interactions effectively attenuated sequence-specific binding affinities by ∼102–105-fold, from the edge to the center of nucleosome, respectively (6Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The present paper extends these results by showing that sequence-specific binding affinities in the region encompassing about 20 bases to either side of the nucleosome core region are attenuated by approximately 50–100-fold for at least some DNA binding factors. The biological significance of this observation is that if such effects are relevant in vivo, very little of the so-called “linker DNA” would be as accessible as might be indicated by nuclease digestion experiments. Nucleases in general do not need as intimate contact with the DNA as sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. In fact, many nucleases can access the phosphodiester backbone at selected sites and effect cleavage at reasonable rates even when the DNA is centrally located within the nucleosome (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New-York1989Crossref Google Scholar, 2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, London1995Google Scholar). Thus, general nuclease cleavage accessibility might not be a good general model for the “openness” of linker DNA. The data indicate that core histone-DNA interactions can have significant effects on accessibility of linker DNA. Furthermore, these results suggest that the region of linker DNA between two neighboring nucleosomes, which is as accessible as naked DNA, is effectively much smaller than previously thought for some transcription factors. Thus strategies in which cis-acting elements are places between nucleosome may require much more precise positioning than was previously evident or may require concurrent nucleosome disruption activities or histone modifications, such as are thought to be relevant for intra-core DNA binding activities. Previous experiments have shown that nucleosome positioning on the 5 S DNA fragment at least partly recapitulates the nucleosome positioning observed in vivo (43Chipev C.C. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Experiments with reconstituted templates showed that the presence of a nucleosome on the X. borealis somatic 5 S rDNA gene efficiently inhibits transcription in Xenopus oocyte extracts, whereas the template could be transcribed in presence of incomplete nucleosome core composed by H3/H4 tetramer (44Almouzni G. Mechali M. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 45Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Transcription in these experiments is correlated with the apparent ability of TFIIIA to bind to the reconstituted templates (18Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 90: 6415-6419Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that nucleosome sliding to expose the TFIIIA-binding site within a linker region between nucleosomes might not be sufficient to allow activation of 5 S genes in vivo since little unrestricted linker DNA is expected to exist between nucleosomes spaced at intervals of approximately 200 base pairs (45Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, other factors, such as histone acetylation must play an important role in activation of these genes, concomitant with displacement of histone H1 (19Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P.

https://openalex.org/W2033397985,"The GM2 gangliosidoses are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the α- (Tay-Sachs) or β- (Sandhoff) subunits of heterodimeric β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A), or the GM2 activator protein (AB variant), a substrate-specific co-factor for Hex A. Although the active site associated with the hydrolysis of GM2 ganglioside, as well as part of the binding site for the ganglioside-activator complex, is associated with the α-subunit, elements of the β-subunit are also involved. Missense mutations in these genes normally result in the mutant protein being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. The mutations associated with the B1-variant of Tay-Sachs are rare exceptions that directly affect residues in the α-active site. We have previously reported two sisters with chronic Sandhoff disease who were heterozygous for the common HEXB deletion allele. Cells from these patients had higher than expected levels of mature β-protein and residual Hex A activity, ∼20%. We now identify these patients' second mutant allele as a C1510T transition encoding a β-Pro504 → Ser substitution. Biochemical characterization of Hex A from both patient cells and cotransfected CHO cells demonstrated that this substitution (a) decreases the level of heterodimer transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum by ∼45%, (b) lowers its heat stability, (c) does not affect its Km for neutral or charged artificial substrates, and (d) lowers the ratio of units of ganglioside/units of artificial substrate hydrolyzed by a factor of 3. We concluded that the β-Pro504 → Ser mutation directly affects the ability of Hex A to hydrolyze its natural substrate but not its artificial substrates. The effect of the mutation on ganglioside hydrolysis, combined with its effect on intracellular transport, produces chronic Sandhoff disease.

Two of these, encoded by the evolutionarily related HEXA (15q23-q24 (1Nakai H. Byers M.G. Nowak N.J. Shows T.B. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1991; 56 (164): 164Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)) andHEXB (5q13 (2Bikker H. Meyer M.F. Merk A.C. de Vijlder J.J. Bolhuis P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16 (8198): 8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) genes, are the α- and β-subunits of heterodimeric β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A), respectively. The third gene product is a small heat-stable protein, the GM2activator protein (activator), encoded by the GM2A gene (5q31.3–33.1 (3Heng H.H.Q. Xie B. Shi X.-M. Tsui L.-C. Mahuran D.J. Genomics. 1993; 18: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)). Mutations in any one of these genes can result in the storage of GM2 and one of the family of human diseases known as the GM2 gangliosidoses. HEXA mutations are associated with Tay-Sachs disease, HEXB with Sandhoff disease, and GM2A with the AB variant form (reviewed in Ref.4Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K.

The GM2 gangliosidoses show extreme variability in clinical expression. Typically, the earlier the age of onset of clinical symptoms the more severe the disease. A nomenclature based on the different clinical phenotypes and recognizing the dominance of the encephalopathy (rather than only the age of onset) has been suggested (4Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. 2. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2839-2879Google Scholar): acute (the classical infantile form), subacute (late infantile and juvenile forms), and chronic (adult and chronic forms). The most common, acute form is a severe neurological disorder that usually results in death within 4 years. Mutations associated with this classical phenotype prevent the formation of any functional Hex A. It is now generally believed that the broad range of less severe phenotypes result from small variations in the levels of residual Hex A activity, on the order of 0–5% (5Leinekugel P. Michel S. Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Hum. Genet. 1992; 88: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Healthy individuals with ∼10% residual Hex A activity have been described (reviewed in Ref. 4Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. 2. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2839-2879Google Scholar). While patients with the acute form of GM2 gangliosidosis are deficient in Hex A activity, their total Hex activity, as measured by neutral artificial substrates, is significant. Tay-Sachs patients often have nearly normal levels of activity due to the presence of the homodimeric Hex B isozyme (ββ), and Sandhoff patients have 1–5% of normal levels from homodimeric Hex S (αα) (reviewed in Ref. 4Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. 2. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2839-2879Google Scholar). Since any dimeric combination of α- and/or β-subunits produces an active isozyme, each subunit must contain a potential active site. The characteristics of the two sites have been examined in the two homodimers (6Kytzia H.-J. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7568-7572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in a novel form of Hex A with an inactive β-subunit due to an Arg211 → Lys substitution (7Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the presence of the β-subunit affects the Km and Vmax of the α active site toward neutral substrates (7Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whereas both subunits of Hex A are equally capable of hydrolyzing neutral β-GlcNAc- or β-GalNAc-containing substrates, e.g.4-methylumbelliferyl-β-N-acetylglucosamine (MUG), only isozymes containing an α-subunit can efficiently hydrolyze negatively charged β-GlcNAc-6-sulfate-containing substrates, e.g.methylumbelliferyl-β-N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate (MUGS), i.e. the MUG/MUGS hydrolysis ratio for Hex B is ∼300, for Hex A ∼4, and for Hex S ∼1 (7Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The specificity of the Hex isozymes for GM2 ganglioside indicates that it should also be considered as a negatively charged substrate, presumably due to the sialic acid residue attached to the penultimate Gal residue. However, whereas Hex S as well as Hex A, but not Hex B, can hydrolyze GM2 in the presence of detergents, only Hex A is functional in vivo with the GM2 activator-GM2ganglioside complex (reviewed in Ref. 4Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. 2. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2839-2879Google Scholar). Thus, some component(s) of the β-subunit are necessary for the hydrolysis of GM2 in vivo. The exact role of the activator remains controversial (8Li S.C. Wu Y.Y. Sugiyama E. Taki T. Kasama T. Casellato R. Sonnino S. Li Y.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24246-24251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Sandhoff K. Harzer K. Fürst W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is generally agreed that it binds both the lipid and oligosaccharide portions of GM2, extracting or at least lifting the ganglioside out of the membrane, and then the complex interacts with Hex A for hydrolysis (11Meier E.M. Schwarzmann G. Fürst W. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1879-1887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hex B can hydrolyze the neutral, asialo derivative of GM2, GA2, in the presence of detergent, but it has little activity in the presence of activator. Furthermore, it has been reported that the activator, even in the absence of GM2, can slightly inhibit the hydrolysis of MUGS by both Hex A and Hex S (reviewed in Refs. 12Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar and 13Sandhoff K. Conzelmann E. Neufeld E.F. Kaback M.M. Suzuki K. Scriver C.V. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. 2. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1807-1839Google Scholar). These data indicate that at least a portion of the binding site for the complex is also located in the α-subunit. The required elements of the β-subunit may function by increasing the affinity of Hex A for the complex and/or correctly orient the complex, allowing the efficient hydrolysis of the terminal sugar from the ganglioside. Furthermore, these β-elements may act directly by interacting with the complex or indirectly by affecting the conformation of the α-subunit. Other functions associated with the β-subunit include greatly increasing the stability of the resulting dimer and facilitating the transport of the α-subunit out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (reviewed in Refs. 4Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. 2.

To date, all missense mutations except those at two codons, in either HEX gene, result in normal levels of mutant mRNA but paradoxically with a dramatic reduction in both mature β- and/or α-protein and Hex B and/or Hex A activity in patient cells. This is believed to be the result of a strict “quality control system” in the ER that prevents the transport and increases the degradation rate of missfolded proteins or unassembled subunits (unlike β-subunits, α-subunits have an apparently low affinity for each other) (reviewed in Refs. 4Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. 2.

In several cases, it has been demonstrated that subunits with missense mutations, even those associated with the most severe clinical phenotype, are not totally incapable of forming a partially functional Hex A but may be prevented from doing so by their retention and degradation in the ER (15Brown C.A. Mahuran D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 497-508PubMed Google Scholar, 16De Gasperi R. Gama Sosa M.A. Battistini S. Yeretsian J. Raghavan S. Zelnik N. Leshinsky E. Kolodny E.H. Neurology. 1996; 47: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the major detrimental effect caused by most HEX missense mutations is at the level of intracellular transport rather than structural changes specifically affecting some aspect of enzyme function. The exceptions to this conclusion are the missense mutations at α-Arg178(17Ohno K. Suzuki K. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Tanaka A. Ohno K. Sandhoff K. Maire I. Kolodny E.H. Brown A. Suzuki K. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 329-339PubMed Google Scholar) and α-Asp258 (19Fernandes M. Kaplan F. Natowicz M. Prence E. Kolodny E. Kaback M. Hechtman P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 759-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which produce the B1 biochemical phenotype. Patients with the most common Arg178→ His substitution were originally thought to have an activator defect, because they express normal levels of both Hex A and Hex B activities, as assayed with neutral (common) substrates, e.g. MUG. However, unlike the normal Hex A found in the true AB variants, Kytzia et al. (20Kytzia H.J. Hinrichs U. Maire I. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1201-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) found that B1 variant-Hex A was inactive toward an α-specific GlcNAc 6-sulfate-containing substrate (as well as GM2 ganglioside even in the presence of added activator protein), and they suggested the presence of a mutation at or near the active site of the α-subunit. This hypothesis has been demonstrated to be correct for substitutions at either residue based on mutational and expression studies of the aligned β-residues, i.e. β-analogs, β-Arg211 (21Brown C.A. Mahuran D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15855-15862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Brown C.A. Neote K. Leung A. Gravel R.A. Mahuran D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7599-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and on molecular modeling of human Hex using the structure of bacterial chitobiase (24Tews I. Perrakis A. Oppenheim A. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We described 10 years ago two sisters of French Canadian ancestry with a chronic Sandhoff phenotype (25Rubin M. Karpati G. Wolfe L.S. Carpenter S. Klavins M.H. Mahuran D.J. J. Neurol. Sci. 1988; 87: 103-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have also previously reported that these patients are heterozygous for the common 16-kb 5′HEXB deletion allele, which does not transcribe β-mRNA (26Neote K. McInnes B. Mahuran D.J. Gravel R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this report, we characterize the second mutant allele in these patients, a missense mutation in exon 13 of the HEXB gene that results in a Pro504 → Ser substitution. This mutation produces a novel biochemical phenotype that impacts directly on the ability of Hex A to hydrolyze GM2. This is the first report of a mutation in the β-subunit that affects the ability of Hex A to hydrolyze its natural but not its artificial substrates and localizes essential elements of the β-chain for natural substrate hydrolysis to its C terminus. Cultured fibroblasts were lysed by directly adding 1.0 ml of DNAZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) to the 10-cm2 culture dish. The lysate was then transferred into an Eppendorf tube, and insoluble cell debris was removed by brief centrifugation. The genomic DNA in the supernatant was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (27McInnes B. Potier M. Wakamatsu N. Melancon S.B. Klavins M.H. Tsuji S. Mahuran D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 306-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by using TRIzoI Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described by Hou et al. (28Hou Y. Vavougios G. Hinek A. Wu K.K. Hechtman P. Kaplan F. Mahuran D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 52-58PubMed Google Scholar). Two μg of total RNA were used to synthesize the single strand cDNA according to the SUPERSCRIPTTM II procedure (Life Technologies). Briefly, RNA was first denatured at 70 °C for 10 min and then incubated at 42 °C for 50 min with 200 units of SUPERSCRIPT II and 0.2 μg of random primers in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm each of four dNTPs. Two μl of this mixture were directly used for PCR to synthesize and amplify double strand cDNA. Amplification of exonic and intron/exon junctions from genomic DNA and cDNA fragments was performed by PCR as described previously (27McInnes B. Potier M. Wakamatsu N. Melancon S.B. Klavins M.H. Tsuji S. Mahuran D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 306-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in a 100-μl volume of 0.1–0.5-μg genomic DNA or 2 μl of cDNA (by reverse transcription), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 0.2 mmeach of four dNTPs, 0.5 μg of each primer, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaqTM Taq polymerase. Amplification was achieved by incubation in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer) for 30 cycles, each consisting of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 55–60 °C, and 1–3 min of extension at 72 °C. The region around exon 13, found to be heterozygous for Pro504 → Ser mutation in genomic DNA and homozygous in cDNA was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 129 (exon 10, sense; GGTTTTGGATATTATTGCAACCATAAA) and 14A (3′-untranslated region, antisense; TCAATCAATAAAAATATTTTATTC). The resulting PCR products from genomic DNA and cDNA were 799 and 716 bp, respectively. PCR products were purified by utilizing the Geneclean Kit (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA), and direct sequencing was performed with [α-35S]dATP using a modification of the SequenaseTM protocol (U.S. Biochemical Corp.), as described by McInnes et al. (27McInnes B. Potier M. Wakamatsu N. Melancon S.B. Klavins M.H. Tsuji S. Mahuran D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 306-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wide type constructs, pREP4-α and pEFNEO-β, have been reported (7Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression vectors pREP4 (Invitrogen) and pEFNEO (kindly supplied by Dr. Anson) (29Anson D.S. Taylor J.A. Bielicki J. Harper G.S. Peters C. Gibson G.J. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), have hygromycin B and neomycin (G418) resistance markers, respectively. To construct the mutant cDNA into pCD vector, a 636-bp product by reverse transcription-PCR from patient fibroblast (as described above) containing β-Pro504 → Ser was digested with PflMI at a site 5′ to the mutation and BanI at a site 3′ to the mutation. The middle fragment of 387 bp was purified and subcloned into pCDβ43 (21Brown C.A. Mahuran D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15855-15862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) treated with PfoMI/partial BanI. To generate the mutant pEFNEO-β-Pro504 → Ser, a 2.0-kb fragment, partially digested by BamHI from pCD-β-Pro504 → Ser, was isolated and subcloned into the BamHI site of the pEFNEO-β vector. The mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. A construct encoding an Asp208 → Asn substitution in the β-cDNA insert of pEFNEO has previously been reported (23Tse R. Vavougios G. Hou Y. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7599-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In permanently transfected CHO cells, this construct produces only soluble, monomeric, precursor β-subunits (23Tse R. Vavougios G. Hou Y. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7599-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We now used this transfected clonal CHO cell line as a control for the ER-retention on mutant β-protein. CHO cells were grown in minimal essential medium with 10% FCS and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using Lipofection from Life Technologies, as described previously (7Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were also grown in serum-free medium containing 10 mmNH4Cl, which diverts proteins targeted to the lysosome to the secretory pathway, for 1 and 2 days, and the Hex activity was measured using MUG. Cells were lysed in a buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5% glycerol through five sets of freeze-thaw cycles. Protein from cell lysate was quantitated by the Lowry method (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hex activity from cell lysates was determined using a α-chain-specific substrate MUGS and the common substrate MUG (15Brown C.A. Mahuran D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 497-508PubMed Google Scholar). The protein (amounts loaded are indicated in each figure) from cell lysates or DEAE fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a Bio-Rad minigel system (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose overnight at 4 °C. The filter was blocked in 5% skim milk and then incubated overnight with primary antibody, rabbit anti-human Hex A (7Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28Hou Y. Vavougios G. Hinek A. Wu K.K. Hechtman P. Kaplan F. Mahuran D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 52-58PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose was washed four times with 1% skim milk and incubated with a secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. The filter was developed and exposed to Hyperfilm using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins (3 mg) from lysates of patient or normal fibroblasts or from control or transfected CHO cells were applied to a 1.0-ml column of DEAE CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The unbound Hex B fraction was collected with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. Hex A was eluted by applying 0.15 m NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0 (7Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Three-ml fractions were collected and assayed for Hex activity. The Km value was determined by varying the concentration of the substrates from 0.125 to 4.0 mm for MUG and from 0.05 to 2.5 mm for MUGS. Also, 10 experimental points were used for eachKm determination. The normal and mutant Hex A from transfected CHO or patient cells were purified away from the other Hex isozymes by DEAE ion exchange chromatography (see above). Kinetic constants were calculated using a computerized nonlinear least squares curve fitting program for the Macintosh, KaleidaGraphTM 3.0 (7Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J.

The hydrolyzed product from GM2, i.e. [3H]GalNAc, was separated from the unreacted GM2 substrate by passage through a positively charged ion exchange minicolumn of 0.6 ml of AG3X4 (acetate form) resin. The unbound fraction containing [3H]GalNAc was determined by liquid scintillation counting, as described previously (7Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant Hex A or Hex B isozymes, which had been separated by DEAE chromatography, were added to 700 μl of preheated citrate phosphate buffer (pH 4.1) with 0.3% human serum albumin. The heat denaturation was performed at 45 °C, and aliquots (100 μl) were removed at intervals of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 min for Hex A and 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min for Hex B, placed on ice, and assayed for enzyme activity. The wild-type and mutant Hex A from transfected CHO cells were also tested for their residual MUGS activity after incubation at 37 °C for 18 h, under conditions that mimicked the natural substrate assay above. Nontransfected CHO cells or CHO cells transfected with constructs encoding (a) the wild-type β-cDNA (lysosomal localization control), (b) the Pro504 → Ser substitution, or (c) an Asp208 → Asn substitution (ER localization control) were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 on glass slide covers in a 10-cm2 culture dish. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were fixed and gently permeabilized with 100% cold methanol at −20 °C for 30 min. The fixed cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with the primary polyclonal anti-Hex B antibody (35Redonnet-Vernhet I. Mahuran D. Salvayre R. Dubas F. Levade T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), diluted 1:200 for 1 h. The secondary antibody, a green fluorescein-labeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2), diluted 1:100, was then added for 1 h, either alone or in combination with a 1:10,000 dilution of propidium iodide, which in addition to nuclear DNA also stains the cytoplasmic RNA and marks the position of the ER with the red fluorescence. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted with elvanol. In control cultures, the preimmune rabbit IgG substituted for the primary antibody. The slides were analyzed, and the proportion of β-protein present in the ER or endosome/lysosome was determined using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus Vanox-AH-3, magnification × 800) and two narrow band filters to detect the green and red fluorescence separately. An additional broad spectrum filter was also used for the simultaneous detection of the fluorescein-tagged green Hex B and the nucleic acids labeled with red propidium iodide fluorescence. In this setting, the overlapping of the red and green labels in the cytoplasm is marked by yellow fluorescence and indicates the colocalization of Hex B and ER (36Hinek A. Molossi S. Rabinovitch M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Multiple images of the same cell obtained with all of the above mentioned filters were captured with the CCD camera (Optronix), stored in a Macintosh 9500 computer, and quantitatively analyzed using the Image Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In each of the three experimental groups (wild type β, β-Pro504 → Ser, and β-Asp208 → Asn), images of 50 cells were analyzed, and results were statistically evaluated to give quantitative measurements of the percentage of each β-protein that resides in the ER and/or lysosome. Direct sequencing of the exons and exon/intron junctions of theHEXB gene revealed that the patients were heterozygous for a C1510T transition in exon 13 (+2 bp from intron 12) at the codon for Pro504, which results in its conversion to a Ser codon (Fig. 1 A).

Since hyperphosphorylation of tyrosine by oncogenic tyrosine kinases often leads to transformation of cells (3Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar), it has been originally postulated that PTPs, which reverse the phosphorylation reaction, might play a role in suppressing oncogenesis (1Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 1013-1016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Recently, however, the situation has become more complicated because a number of cDNAs that encode the PTP gene have been isolated from various organisms, mainly by sequence similarity between the conserved regions of the catalytic domains (4Krueger N.X.

In fact, recent studies have demonstrated specific functions of PTP isozymes in physiological events (see for review, Ref. 7Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). For example, even among structurally similar PTP isozymes, entirely distinct functions have been documented: SHP1 and SHP2 are both non-receptor PTPs with two tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains in their amino-terminal regions (8Adachi M.

At the pathological level, genetic failure in the shp1 locus leads to autoimmune disease with hyperproliferation of hematopoietic cells (12Tsui H.W. Siminovitch K.A. de Souza L. Tsui F.W.L. Nat.

On the other hand, SHP2 is required for mitogenic signal transduction from receptor tyrosine kinases to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (14Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S.

These observations suggest that other PTP isozymes, even if they are structurally related through entire sequences, also have distinct functions although some redundancy might exist. Meanwhile, a novel PTP isozyme PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 has been identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene (18Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L.

Previous studies, including ours, suggest a functional involvement of PTPs in terminal differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. Pharmacological differentiation of leukemia cells is often accompanied by an increase in cellular PTP activity (21Frank D.A. Sartorelli A.C.

Meanwhile, such differentiation is often inhibited by sodium orthovanadate, a PTP inhibitor (25Zhao Z. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5007-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previously, we identified 13 PTP gene fragments from the differentiated monoblastoid leukemia U937 cells by employing the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction strategy (24Seimiya H.

Blood. 1994; 84: 4186-4194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is induced during monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells (33Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Toho M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2047-2054PubMed Google Scholar). 2H. Seimiya and T. Tsuruo, unpublished results. PTP-U2 is a receptor-like PTP with a single transmembrane domain and a single intracellular catalytic domain (26Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Inazawa J. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1731-1738PubMed Google Scholar). Physiologically, thePTP-U2 gene is expressed as tissue-specific isoforms, which are probably due to alternative splicing of the transcript. The extracellular domain of the longest isoform contains 14 putativeN-glycosylation sites and eight repeats of a fibronectin-type III-like motif. Especially, in U937 cells,PTP-U2 gene expression is greatly induced by phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which arrests growth and induces monocytic differentiation of U937 cells (24Seimiya H. Tsuruo T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 1033-1039PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PTP-U2 gene expression is also induced or enhanced during various types of differentiation of myeloid and erythroid leukemia cells, including HL-60, HEL, and K562. Other myeloid leukemia THP-1 cells, which often differentiate spontaneously even without inducers, express a relatively high amount of PTP-U2transcript. On the contrary, TPA does not induce or enhancePTP-U2 gene expression in solid tumor cells that do not differentiate upon treatment with TPA (26Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Inazawa J. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1731-1738PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we supposed that PTP-U2 would be functionally involved in drug-induced differentiation of U937 cells. However, the precise role of PTP-U2 in terminal differentiation has yet to be determined. In this study, we investigated the function of the longest PTP-U2 isoform (PTP-U2L) during TPA-induced differentiation and subsequent cell death of U937 cells. We found that PTP-U2L enhances the apoptotic event that follows TPA-induced differentiation of U937 cells. The physiological importance of PTP-U2L function is also discussed. Human monoblastoid leukemia U937 cells were grown as described previously (24Seimiya H. Tsuruo T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 1033-1039PubMed Google Scholar). A phorbol ester-resistant U937 variant, UT16, was established and characterized as described (33Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Toho M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2047-2054PubMed Google Scholar). Human embryonal kidney 293T cells were kindly provided by Dr. T. Suzuki (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Cellular differentiation was induced by treatment with 5 ng/ml TPA (Sigma) and characteristic changes in cellular morphology, development of adherence to plastic substratum, and cell surface expression of CD14 or CD11b glycoproteins were monitored. Expression of CD14 or CD11b was determined by flow cytometry, as described previously (33Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Toho M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2047-2054PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer E consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2% Triton X-100 (34Pallen C.J. Tong P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6996-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Differentiated cells were harvested by scraping in buffer E after PBS washing. The lysate was incubated with occasional mixing at 4 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to obtain the solubilized fractions. The protein concentration in the extracts was determined using a Protein Assay System reagent (Bio-Rad). The samples (30 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schreicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membranes were soaked in 10% skim milk, PBS at room temperature for 1 h and further incubated for 1 h with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody raised against PTP-U2 carboxyl-terminal 15-amino acid residues (26Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Inazawa J. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1731-1738PubMed Google Scholar) or mouse anti-T cell PTP antibody (Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY). The membranes were then washed with 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% skim milk, PBS and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). After washing the membranes extensively with 0.1% Tween 20, PBS, the specific signals were detected on X-Omat AR films (Kodak, Rochester, NY) using an ECL detection system (Amersham Int.). Cellular lysates were prepared as described above. Portions of the lysates (240 μg of protein per triplicate assay) were gently stirred with rabbit anti-PTP-U2 antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunocomplex was extensively washed with the PTP assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 6, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm2,3-dihydroxybutane-1,4-dithiol). PTP activity in the immunocomplex was measured against phosphotyrosyl substrates, END(pY)INASL (PS1) (35Daum G. Solca F. Diltz C.D. Zhao Z. Cool D.E. Fischer E.H. Anal.

The full-length cDNA forPTP-U2L (26Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Inazawa J. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1731-1738PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into a mammalian expression vector pCR3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the resulting plasmid was designated as pCR3/PTP-U2L. pCR3/PTP-U2L(C → S), the expression vector for the catalytically inactive mutant of PTP-U2L (point mutated at Cys1136 to Ser1136) was constructed with pCR3/PTP-U2L as a template and a Chameleon mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the instruction manual. DNA sequences of the constructs were confirmed by an ABI PRISM Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Chiba, Japan) with a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler and an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. Twenty micrograms of pCR3, pCR3/PTP-U2L, or pCR3/PTP-U2L(C → S) were transfected into 107 U937 cells by electroporation using a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad). After the recovery culture of 48 h, transfectants were selected by treatment with 0.8 mg/ml geneticin (Sigma), and the resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution. Expression of PTP-U2L or PTP-U2L(C → S) protein was monitored by Western blot analysis, as described above, and the positive clones were used for subsequent experiments. Apoptosis was monitored through characteristic changes in cellular morphology, externalization of phosphatidylserine (37Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Kuijten G.A.M. Keehnen R.M.J.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 741-743PubMed Google Scholar). Externalization of phosphatidylserine was detected by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Kamiya Biomedical, Seattle, WA) staining, as described previously (40Naito M. Nagashima K. Mashima T. Tsuruo T. Blood. 1997; 89: 2060-2066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation was measured, as described previously (41Seimiya H. Mashima T. Toho M. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4631-4636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In brief, PBS-washed cells (1 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 20 μl of solution A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 50 °C for 90 min. Then, 10 μl of solution B (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 15 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml ribonuclease A) was added and the mixture was further incubated at 50 °C for 90 min. Finally, DNAs in the reaction were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis (2% agarose, TBE buffer). Propidium iodide staining of cellular DNA was carried out as follows: cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 70% ethanol for 30 min, and treated with 2 mg/ml ribonuclease A/PBS at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing in PBS, cells were resuspended in 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), PBS, passed through a 70-μm nylon mesh filter, and analyzed by using a FACScan system (Beckton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). When U937 cells were continuously treated with 5 ng/ml TPA, they differentiate into monocytes and macrophages (42Lotem H. Sachs L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1989; 48: 282-293PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the cell surface expression of CD11b glycoprotein, one marker for monocytic differentiation, gradually increased during the course of differentiation. Similarly, CD14 glycoprotein, another marker, was also induced (data not shown). Meanwhile, adhesion of cells to a plastic substratum was one of the most drastic changes observed in the differentiated U937 cells. While the undifferentiated U937 cells were grown in suspension, the TPA-treated cells adhered to a culture dish and the percentage of the adherent cells increased up to 70% in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). To investigate the kinetics of PTP-U2 activation, we first monitored the PTP-U2 enzyme activity in U937 cells with an anti-PTP-U2 immunocomplex PTP assay (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 2 A, PTP-U2 enzyme activity against phosphotyrosyl substrate 1 (PS1; END(pY)INASL; derived from a highly conserved region of T cell PTP) (35Daum G. Solca F. Diltz C.D. Zhao Z.

Maximal activation of the enzyme was observed at 72 h (10.5- and 4.5-fold activation against PS1 and PS2, respectively). A nonspecific PTP inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), efficiently inhibited the activity, indicating that the release of free phosphate from the phosphotyrosyl substrates was due to the catalytic activity of the PTP. The control immunocomplex precipitated without anti-PTP-U2 antibody did not exhibit any trace of PTP activity (data not shown). On the other hand, UT16 cells, TPA-resistant variant of U937 (33Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Toho M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2047-2054PubMed Google Scholar), did not respond to TPA with the PTP-U2 enzymatic activation. To determine whether enzyme activation of PTP-U2 during TPA-induced differentiation was due to enhanced expression of PTP-U2 protein, we analyzed the amounts of PTP-U2 protein using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.2 B, while expression of PTP-U2 protein was not detected after treatment with TPA for 0–6 h, the 70-kDa protein that we reported to be the shorter isoform of PTP-U2 (26Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Inazawa J. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1731-1738PubMed Google Scholar) was induced at 9–72 h. Interestingly, further incubation with TPA led to reduction of the shorter isoform expression and induction of a larger protein at 220 kDa. The size of this protein corresponded to that of the PTP-U2 larger isoform ectopically expressed in 293T and U937 cells (Fig. 2 B, right panel). In this report we refer to the 70- and 220-kDa isoforms as PTP-U2S and PTP-U2L, respectively. Employing the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we also detected gene expression of PTP-U2L in U937 cells treated with TPA for 96 h but not in the control cells (data not shown). On the other hand, the amount of T cell PTP protein, nonreceptor PTP isozyme, was down-regulated during the differentiation, indicating differential expression of PTPs in each isozyme-specific manner. In UT16 cells, neither PTP-U2S nor PTP-U2L were induced by treatment with TPA (data not shown). To elucidate the functional involvement of PTP-U2L in TPA-induced differentiation of U937 cells, we transfected the expression vector for the PTP-U2L gene (under control of a cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter) into U937 cells. Resulting transfectants named as U21L2, U21L4, and U21L6 constitutively expressed PTP-U2L protein (the representative data are shown in Fig.3 A) and displayed normal growth rates, compared with parental U937 cells and mock transfectants (data not shown). Under normal growth conditions, we did not find significant morphological differences between the cell lines (Fig.4, A-D). Upon treatment with 5 ng/ml TPA for 72 h, however, all the PTP-U2L transfectants exhibited higher induction of CD14 glycoprotein than control transfectants, such as mock4 (p < 0.01 orp < 0.025, evaluated by an unpaired Student'st test, Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, the PTP-U2L transfectants exhibited higher sensitivity to TPA than the control cells (Fig. 3 C). For example, sensitivity of the PTP-U2L transfectants to 1 ng/ml TPA was about 6-fold higher than that of mock4.Figure 4Morphological changes in TPA-treated PTP-U2L transfectants. Cells were cultured with or without 5 ng/ml TPA for 72 h.

In the case of U937 and the mock transfectants, the differentiated cells adhered to the culture dish, but still retained their round shape and looked phase-bright under phase-contrast microscopy. On the other hand, there were more drastic changes in the PTP-U2L transfectants. These cells adhered to the culture dish to such an extent that we could not distinguish them from the other kinds of adherent cells. Some of them lost the globular shape and showed a flat and polygonal morphology. The borders of the cell-cell contact were also observed. More interestingly, cellular fragments, probably due to the formation of apoptotic bodies, were often observed in the culture of TPA-treated PTP-U2L transfectants. This finding suggests that hypersensitivity to TPA of PTP-U2L transfectants (Fig. 3 C), was due to enhanced susceptibility of the cells to TPA-induced apoptosis. To determine whether TPA could induce apoptosis of PTP-U2L transfectants, we analyzed DNA content of each clone during TPA-induced differentiation. Upon treatment with 5 ng/ml TPA for 48–96 h, mock4 cells arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase (Fig.5 A). Subsequent to this growth arrest, a trace of a subdiploid (apoptotic) fraction was observed at 192 h (day 8). Under the same culture conditions, U21L4 and U21L6 cells exhibited the G0/G1 arrest at 24 h (at least 24 h earlier than the mock4 cells). Furthermore, drastic accumulation of the subdiploid fraction was observed at 96 h. Like U21L4 and U21L6 cells, U21L2, but not mock1 and U937 cells, showed rapid accumulation of the G0/G1 fraction (data not shown) and a drastic shift of the population to the subdiploid fraction (Fig. 5 B). When a cell undergoes apoptosis, chromosomal DNA is degraded into nucleosome-size fragments, that is a most characteristic property of apoptotic cell death. We observed TPA-induced fragmentation of the chromosomal DNA in the PTP-U2L transfectants but not in the mock clones (Fig. 5 C). At the early phase of apoptosis, the plasma membrane phosphatidylserine is externalized to the cell surface (37Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Kuijten G.A.M. Keehnen R.M.J. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H.J. Blood. 1994; 85: 1415-1420Crossref Google Scholar, 38Martin J.S. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C.A.A. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar). Consistent to this event, TPA-treated PTP-U2L transfectants significantly externalized phosphatidylserine but the mock4 cells did not (Fig. 5 D). This also means that TPA-induced differentiation itself does not lead to externalization of phosphatidylserine. Taken together, these data indicate that PTP-U2L enhances TPA-induced cell death of U937 cells, and the mode of cell death seems to be apoptosis. Caspase family proteases (originally known as ICE-like proteases) are downstream regulators of apoptosis (44Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 45Kumar S. Harvey N.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene (Z-Asp-CH2-DCB), an aspartate-based inhibitor of caspases, inhibited apoptosis of U937 cells induced by various stimuli (46Mashima T. Naito M. Kataoka S. Kawai H. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). So, we examined the effect of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB on TPA-induced apoptosis of PTP-U2L transfectants. As shown in Fig.6, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, drastically induced apoptosis of U937 cells, but it was completely blocked in the presence of 50 μg/ml Z-Asp-CH2-DCB. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB on TPA-induced apoptosis of PTP-U2L transfectants (U21L clones) was also detected, but it was more moderate than on the camptothecin-induced apoptosis. In the presence of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, TPA-induced apoptosis of U21L clones was only 35% inhibited. To determine whether apoptosis enhancement by PTP-U2L required catalytic activity of the enzyme, we constructed a catalytically inactive mutant PTP-U2L(C → S) gene, in which the codon for an essential cysteine residue (TGC) in the conserved active-site HCxxGxxRS(T) motif (for review, see Ref. 47Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) was point mutated to that for serine (AGC). The mutant PTP-U2L(C → S) gene was transfected into U937 cells, and the resulting U2L/CS20 and U2L/CS21 were representative clones that stably expressed the mutant PTP-U2L(C → S) protein (Fig. 7 A). Under normal growth conditions, growth rates of PTP-U2L(C → S) transfectants were comparable to those of wild-type PTP-U2L and mock transfectants (data not shown). Intracellular amounts of the ectopic PTP-U2L protein in the mutant transfectants were often higher than those in wild-type transfectants; the representative result is shown in Fig. 7 A. Upon treatment with 5 ng/ml TPA for 72 h, U2L/CS20 and U2L/CS21 cells still differentiated into monocytic lineage and adhered to the culture dish. As shown in Fig. 8, the differentiated cells adhered extensively to the dish and showed flat and polygonal morphology, which was similar to the phenotypic changes observed in the TPA-treated wild-type PTP-U2L transfectants (Fig. 4). These observations indicate that PTP-U2L(C → S), despite the loss of its catalytic activity, retained its accelerative effect on TPA-induced differentiation of U937 cells. We further examined the susceptibility of U2L/CS20 and U2L/CS21 cells to TPA-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 7 B, PTP-U2L(C → S) still enhanced apoptosis of the transfectant to some extent, as compared with mock4 cells, which differentiated and was strictly arrested at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. However, the effect of PTP-U2L(C → S) on apoptosis enhancement was considerably reduced, compared with wild-type PTP-U2L (p < 0.01, Fig. 7, B and C; see also Fig. 8, Cand D). This observation suggests that PTP-U2L catalytic activity is required for maximal enhancement of TPA-induced apoptosis by PTP-U2L. These findings were repeated with other PTP-U2L(C → S) transfectants with similar results (Fig. 7 C). PTP-U2L transfectants exhibited progressive adhesion to the culture dish (Fig. 4). PTP-U2L(C → S) transfectants also retained this ability (Fig. 8), suggesting that the extracellular domain of PTP-U2L, consisting of eight fibronectin type III-like repeats, directly functioned as an adhesion molecule in a catalytic activity-independent manner (Fig. 9). Similar to these observations, previous reports have revealed that type II receptor-like PTPs, RPTPμ and RPTPκ, which have extracellular domains consisting of four fibronectin type III-like repeats, a single Ig-like domain, and an NH2-terminal MAM domain, mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion even without the cytoplasmic domain (48Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 49Sap J. Jiang Y.-P. Friedlander D. Grumet M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Wubbolts R.W. Beijersbergen R.L. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16101-16104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the PTP-U2L transfectants were still in suspension in the absence of TPA, the extracellular domain of PTP-U2L would enhance cellular adhesion in cooperation with other molecules which expression was induced by TPA. Among other characteristics of TPA-induced differentiation, CD14 expression was enhanced and the G0/G1 arrest occurred earlier in the cell cycle of PTP-U2L transfectants than in that of mock transfectants (Figs. 3 B and 5 A). On the other hand, CD11b up-regulation by TPA was comparable with PTP-U2L and mock transfectants (data not shown). These observations indicate that there are parallel but distinct signaling pathways for TPA-induced differentiation and that PTP-U2L specifically participates in some of those pathways. While PTP-U2L enhanced TPA-induced apoptosis of U937 cells (Figs. 4 and5), it seems to be specific to terminal differentiation of leukemia cells or at least be limited to certain situations. First, there are normal tissues that constitutively express PTP-U2L (26Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Inazawa J. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1731-1738PubMed Google Scholar). Among them are kidney and brain, in which podocyte and olfactory bulb exhibit dominant expression of PTP-U2L, respectively (27Thomas P.E. Wharram B.L. Goyal M. Wiggins J.E. Holzman L.B. Wiggins R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19953-19962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Yahagi Y. Tagawa M. Tomoda T. Shirasawa T. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 211: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Second, when 293T cells were transfected with the PTP-U2L gene, TPA sensitivity of the resulting transfectants was comparable to that of the mock cells.2 Third, PTP-U2L was induced during TPA-induced differentiation (Fig. 2 B) but not during camptothecin- or etoposide-induced apoptosis of U937 cells (data not shown). Apoptosis enhancement by PTP-U2L required exposure of the cells to TPA (Figs. 4 and 5). While TPA is a potent activator of protein kinase C (52Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar) and causes activation of the further downstream ERK/MAPK cascade (53Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Emoto Y. Stone R. Rapp U. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 872-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, another protein kinase C activator, does not induce differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells (54Kreutter D. Caldwell A.B. Morin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5979-5984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol did not induce apoptosis of the PTP-U2L transfectants at all despite ERK/MAPK activation (data not shown). These data suggest that apoptosis enhancement by PTP-U2L requires a differentiation-associated factor induced by TPA but not by 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (Fig. 9). The result in Fig. 6 suggests that Z-Asp-CH2-DCB-sensitive caspases are, in part, involved in the PTP-U2L-mediated apoptosis of differentiated U937 cells. Strictly speaking, the inhibitory effect of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB was only partial, and there could be other mechanisms of PTP-U2L-mediated apoptosis that are independent of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB-sensitive caspases. In fact, caspase-3 activation was significantly observed during camptothecin-induced apoptosis of U937 cells whereas that was only marginal during PTP-U2L-mediated apoptosis of the cells.2 PTP-U2L(C → S) exhibited an intermediate effect on TPA-induced apoptosis, as compared with mock and wild-type PTP-U2L (Figs. 7,B and C, and 8). These data suggest that maximal enhancement of apoptosis by PTP-U2L requires its catalytic activity. In that sense, it is still possible that overexpression of PTP-U2L itself could elicit apoptosis in U937 cells. In fact, the wild-type PTP-U2L transfectants generally expressed lower amounts of PTP-U2L protein than the mutant types did (Fig. 7 A). One explanation for this circumstance is that high producer clones for the wild-type PTP-U2L might die by apoptosis during the cloning procedures. Consistent with this idea, transfection experiments of wild-type PTP-U2L into TPA-resistant UT16 cells have not worked so far, whereas it has been easy to obtain the PTP-U2L(C → S)-transfected UT16 clones.2 As UT16 cells have been established by prolonged exposure of U937 cells to TPA (33Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Toho M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2047-2054PubMed Google Scholar), differentiation-associated factor(s), required for the PTP-U2L-mediated and its catalytic activity dependent apoptosis (see above), seem to have irreversibly up-regulated in UT16 cells. If this were the case, introducing the wild-typePTP-U2L gene would kill the cells by apoptosis. In the presence of a caspase inhibitor (Z-Asp-CH2-DCB), only 35% of the wild PTP-U2L-mediated apoptosis was inhibited (Fig. 6), whereas 53% of the C → S mutant-mediated apoptosis was inhibited (data not shown). These observations suggest that the PTP-U2L catalytic activity dependent apoptosis, which is abolished by the C → S mutation, represents the caspase-insensitive cell death. Meanwhile, it has been also suggested that PTP(C → S) mutants in some case might exhibit a dominant positive effect by trapping their substrates (7Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and determination of specific substrate(s) for PTP-U2L is our future interest to understand the downstream pathway of PTP-U2L-mediated signaling. PTP-U2 is expressed as at least three different isoforms in a tissue-specific manner (26Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Inazawa J. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1731-1738PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, more shorter transcripts than PTP-U2S have been reported as PTPφ, the murine homolog of PTP-U2 (28Pixley F.J. Lee P.S.W. Dominguez M.G. Einstein D.B. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27339-27347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Quiescent macrophages express PTPφ, which is down-regulated when the cells are activated by colony-stimulating factor-1 (28Pixley F.J. Lee P.S.W. Dominguez M.G. Einstein D.B. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27339-27347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). During the course of TPA-induced differentiation of U937 cells, PTP-U2S was induced as an early event whereas PTP-U2L was as a late event (Fig. 2 B). Given the kinetics of PTP-U2S induction, one could speculate that the shorter isoforms, such as PTP-U2S and PTPφ, might play a role in triggering commitment to differentiation or in maintaining differentiated phenotypes of the cells (see the scheme shown in Fig. 9). Determination of PTP-U2S whole cDNA structure would afford transfection experiments to elucidate the precise role of PTP-U2S. Terminally differentiated hematopoietic cells often die by apoptosis (55Martin S.J. Bradley J.G. Cotter T.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 79: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated the first instance of PTP involvement in apoptosis subsequent to terminal differentiation of leukemia cells. The present data also suggest a functional involvement of PTP-U2L in the physiological events. For example, PTP-U2L might participate in turnover of peripheral myelocytes by eliminating them by apoptosis. If this is so and there are no functionally redundant PTP isozymes, failure in PTP-U2L function could have serious outcomes, such as hematopoietic disorders. The PTP-U2 gene is localized to chromosome 12p13.2-p13.3 (26Seimiya H. Sawabe T. Inazawa J. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1731-1738PubMed Google Scholar), a region of interest because it is a common site of chromosomal abnormalities in such malignant proliferations as eosinophilia (56Keene P. Mendelow B. Pinto M.R. Bezwoda W. MacDougall L. Falkson G. Ruff P. Bernstein R. Br. J. Haematol. 1987; 67: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, PTP-U2 is expressed as various isoforms in a tissue-specific manner. Thus, determination of the physiological role of PTP-U2 awaits the generation of PTP-U2 knock-out animals and cell lines. We are grateful to Naomi Wada for skillful assistance with experiments."

The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans.in: Lennarz W.J. Plenum Press, New York1980Google Scholar) in which uronic acid may be either glucuronic or iduronic acid and the glucosamine residue may be eitherN-acetylated (GlcNAc) or N-sulfated (GlcNSO4). Structural studies (2Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Lyon M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) indicate that blocks of GlcNSO4 containing sulfate-rich disaccharides (“heparin-like” domains) are interspersed with blocks of sulfate-poor domains containing GlcNAc disaccharides. The latter domains might also be composed of unsubstituted glucosamine-containing domains (3Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

These domains, with different structural modifications includingO-sulfation of uronic acid residues and N- andO-sulfation of glucosamine residues, impart specific properties to heparan sulfate. For example, 3-O-sulfated glucosamine and 2-O-sulfated hexuronic acid residues have been implicated in antithrombotic (1Roden L. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans.in: Lennarz W.J.

In the present study, we report the identification of a distinct oligosaccharide structure in human breast cancer cell (MCF-7) HS that exhibits strong affinity for laminin-1. heparan sulfate GluA → AManR(6-SO4) IdoA → AManR(6-SO4) IdoA(2-SO4) → AManR IdoA(2-SO4) → AManR(6-SO4) GluA(2-SO4) → AManR high performance liquid chromatography bovine fibroblast growth factor minimum essential medium. heparan sulfate GluA → AManR(6-SO4) IdoA → AManR(6-SO4) IdoA(2-SO4) → AManR IdoA(2-SO4) → AManR(6-SO4) GluA(2-SO4) → AManR high performance liquid chromatography bovine fibroblast growth factor minimum essential medium. Human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in MEM with Earle's salts containing non-essential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, bovine insulin (10 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in 225-cm2 flasks, incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Mouse laminin-1 (nidogen-free) was purchased from ICN. Laminin-1 was coupled to Reacti-Gel (6×) Support according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce), in the presence of heparin (Sigma, Grade I) (laminin:heparin ratio = 1:30, by weight). The efficiency of coupling was approximately 80%. The laminin affinity column prepared in this manner contained 0.8 mg of laminin/ml of gel. MCF-7 cells were biosynthetically radiolabeled (11Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Midura R.J. Yanagishita M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 390-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with 20 μCi/ml carrier-free [35S]Na2SO4 (∼43 Ci/mg of sulfur) (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.) for 48 h. The medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell layer was solubilized with cold 0.1 m NaOH for 15–20 min. An aliquot of the cell fraction was assayed for protein content (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the remainder was adjusted to pH 8.0 by adding 50% (v/v) acetic acid. After adjusting to 5 mmCaCl2, the material was digested with 2% w/w Pronase (Calbiochem) at 37 °C for 48 h. The digest was diluted by 5 volumes with water and subjected to purification by DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) filtration (13Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The sample was applied to the column (5 ml bed volume), which was equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.25m NaCl. After washing the column with 20 volumes of the equilibrating buffer, bound glycosaminoglycan was eluted with 10 column volumes of 2 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.5. The glycosaminoglycan material was recovered by extensive dialysis using Spectraphore Membrane (Mr cut off 3500) against water, followed by lyophilization. The purified glycosaminoglycan was digested with chondroitinase ABC lyase (Seikagaku America Inc.) (14Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The digest was fractionated on a DEAE-cellulose column (3 ml bed volume) in pyridine-formate buffers (15Parthasarathy N. Spiro R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After removal of chondroitin sulfate-derived disaccharides by washing with 0.5 mpyridine acetate, pH 5.0, [35SO4]HS peptides were eluted with 2.5 m pyridine acetate, pH 5.0. [35SO4]HS peptides were subsequently subjected to β-elimination (1 m NaBH4, 50 mm NaOH, 45 °C, 20 h) to release HS chains (16Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Excess borohydride was destroyed by addition of ice-cold 2m acetic acid, and HS chains were recovered after passage through AG-50W-X8 (200–400 mesh H+ form) (Bio-Rad).35SO4 activity was monitored during HS isolation only, whereas 3H activity was monitored during the subsequent fractionation of 3H-oligosaccharides. Hydrazinolysis of HS chains was carried out by treatment with anhydrous hydrazine, 1% hydrazine sulfate for 9 h at 100 °C as described previously (5Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17McGee M.P. Teuschler H. Parthasarathy N. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26109-26115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The deacetylated HS chains were treated with high pH (4.0) nitrous acid reagent (0.5m H2SO4, 5.5 mNaNO2, 2:5) for 30 min at room temperature (18Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH of the oligosaccharide products was adjusted to 8.5 with 1 mNa2CO3 and reduced with 0.5 mCi of [3H]NaBH4 (1.5 Ci/mmol) (ICN) at 50 °C for 30 min (5Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled oligosaccharides were recovered by passage through AG-50W-X8 (200–400 mesh, H+form), as described previously. 3H-Labeled HS oligosaccharides were loaded onto a 1-ml laminin-1 affinity column, which was equilibrated with 2 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.5, 5 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2. The flow-through was reloaded onto the column three to four times to achieve maximal binding. The column was washed with 30 ml of equilibrating buffer containing 140 mm NaCl. Bound oligosaccharides were eluted in a stepwise manner with the buffer containing 0.4 and 1.5m NaCl. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and the radioactivity in an aliquot of each fraction was determined. Gel chromatography of laminin-bound3H-labeled HS oligosaccharides was performed on a Bio-Gel P-10 (Bio-Rad) column (1.5 × 85 cm) in 0.5 m pyridine acetate, pH 5.0 (13Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); 1-ml fractions were collected. The laminin-bound oligosaccharides were converted to disaccharides by low pH (1.5) HNO2treatment (19Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1985; 11: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and reduced with [3H]NaBH4. The disaccharides were further purified by passage through Darco-Celite columns (20Shen G-Q. Kresbach G. Spiro M.J. Spiro R.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and then analyzed on a 4.6 × 250 mm Partisil 10 SAX column (Whatman) using a stepwise gradient of 12 mm, 26 mm, and 200 mm KH2PO4to elute nonsulfated, monosulfated, and disulfated disaccharides, respectively. The sulfated 3H-disaccharide mixture standard, from heparin, was purchased from Chirazyme Inc., Urbana, IL. Molecular models were built (5Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Jones C. Davies D.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 393: 849-858Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and visualized using the program Insight (MSI, San Diego, CA). Isolated MCF-7 HS chains wereN-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis and reacted with nitrous acid at high pH (4.0) (18Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to cleave the glycosidic linkages followingN-unsubstituted d-glucosamine residues. The resulting oligosaccharide mixture, terminating at 2,5-anhydromannose residues, was reduced with [3H]NaBH4 to produce 3H-oligosaccharides, which were fractionated on a laminin-1 affinity column. Approximately 97% of the oligosaccharides did not bind to the column. Bound oligosaccharides, constituting 3% of the total radioactivity loaded, were eluted from the column in the 0.4 and 1.5 m NaCl fractions (Fig.1). The size of 3H-labeled HS oligosaccharides with high (1.5m NaCl) and low (0.4 m NaCl) affinity for laminin-1 was determined by Bio-Gel P-10 chromatography. High as well as low affinity oligosaccharides were predominantly comprised of dodecasaccharides (6 disaccharides in length), as they were eluted in a position between low molecular weight heparins ofMr ∼5000 and Mr ∼3500 (Fig. 2). Low pH (1.5) nitrous acid treatment was employed to degrade high affinity oligosaccharides into disaccharides, which were further reduced with [3H]NaBH4.3H-Disaccharides were subsequently analyzed by ion-exchange HPLC on a Partisil 10 SAX column eluted with a KH2PO4 gradient. By comparison with standard disaccharides from commercial heparin (Fig.3 A) and with published data (18Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ISMS was found to be the only major disacccharide (Fig.3 B) of the laminin-1 high affinity oligosaccharide. Based on these findings, the probable structure for laminin-1 high affinity oligosaccharide is [IdoA(2-SO4) → GlcNSO4(6-SO4)]5[IdoA(2-SO4) → AManR(6-SO4)]. The low affinity dodecasaccharide gave rise to two disaccharides, ISMS and ISM at the ratio of 5:1 (data not shown). A molecular model of a heparin dodecasaccharide, corresponding with the high affinity structure described above, was obtained by using the atomic coordinates of an NMR-derived solution conformation of heparin (21Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Jones C. Davies D.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 393: 849-858Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Heparin binding activity has been localized to the G domain of recombinant laminin-1 (22Sung U. O'Rear J.J. Yurchenco P.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and a peptide sequence in this region, amino acids 3010–3031 (KQNCLSSRASFRGCVRNLRLSR), has been suggested as a heparin-binding site (23Sasaki M. Kleinman H.K. Huber H. Deutzmann R. Yamada Y J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16536-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A three-dimensional structure has not been reported for the G domain of laminin-1, and the above sequence does not show sufficiently strong similarity to any peptide segment of known structure to allow modeling on the basis of homology. However, the sequence does contain several basic residues spread along its length, and when the sequence is modeled as a right-handed α-helix all four internal arginine residues are found on one side of the helix (Fig.4 A). This configuration of the peptide would allow the flexible arginine side chains to interact with clusters of sulfate groups along the length of the high affinity oligosaccharide (Fig. 4 B). The present investigation shows that a sulfate-rich oligosaccharide fraction in MCF-7 tumor cell HS, composed of a sequence of six disaccharides, binds strongly to laminin-1. This oligosaccharide was generated by employing a hydrazinolysis/deamination procedure (18Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which causes the cleavage of deacetylatedN-acetylglucosaminic bonds at pH 4.0 and releases HS fragments rich in N-sulfated glucosamine residues. This high affinity oligosaccharide (Fig. 1) consists of six repeating disaccharide units of the structure [IdoA(2-SO4) → GlcNSO4(6-SO4)] (Figs. 2 and3 B). Therefore, the structure for laminin-bound high affinity oligosaccharide is [IdoA(2-SO4) → GlcNSO4(6-SO4)]5[IdoA(2-SO4) → AManR(6-SO4)]. A slightly less sulfated dodecasaccharide of the composition [IdoA(2-SO4) → GlcNSO4(6-SO4)]5[IdoA(2-SO4) → GlcNSO4] was also isolated. While the homogeneity of this oligosaccharide remains to be ascertained, it binds to laminin-1 with low affinity (Fig. 1) compared with the high affinity oligosaccharide, even though both of these oligosaccharides are approximately the same size (Fig. 2). The strong interaction of laminin-1 with heparin or HS has been known (9Timpl R. Brown J.C. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) for quite some time. Indeed, heparin-agarose chromatography has been routinely employed (24Arumugham R.G. Trumbore M. Thomas T. Makhlouf S. Tanzer M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1988; 18: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) to separate laminin-1 subunits. Despite reports suggesting a strong binding between laminin-1 and heparin or heparan sulfate, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a specific extended oligosaccharide sequence in HS that has high affinity for laminin-1. A number of heparin-binding proteins, comprised of different biologically important macromolecules, including bFGF (25Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hepatocyte growth factor (26Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), platelet factor 4 (8Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20508-20514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and lipoprotein lipase (5Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) interact with heparan sulfate via specific oligosaccharide sequences enriched in IdoA(2-SO4) → GlcNSO4(6-SO4). Along withN-sulfation of glucosamine residues, 2-O-sulfation of iduronic acids and/or 6-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues are the necessary structural requirements for these heparin-binding proteins to interact and elicit their biological activities. In the present study, a similar oligosaccharide sequence was also involved in the binding of HS to laminin-1. Experiments are in progress to examine the minimal sulfation requirements of HS for binding to laminin-1, through chemical modification of laminin affinity oligosaccharide. Alternatively, Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants defective in heparan sulfate biosynthesis (13Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Bame K.J. Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) could be employed to study the role of sulfation in interaction and adhesion to laminin-1. Heparan sulfate is also known to bind to a number of biologically important molecules (28Fromm J.R. Hileman R.E. Caldwell E.E.O. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) including antithrombin (1Roden L. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans.in: Lennarz W.J. Plenum Press, New York1980Google Scholar), bFGF (25Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hepatocyte growth factor (26Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and lipoprotein lipase (5Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding sites, or the percent of oligosaccharides with affinity for these proteins, constitute less than 5% of the total oligosaccharides (1Roden L. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans.in: Lennarz W.J. Plenum Press, New York1980Google Scholar,5Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the present study it is not surprising that laminin-1 bound to highly specific oligosaccharide sequences, which comprise only 3% of the total MCF-7 oligosaccharides. It is possible that even though present in low proportions, the strategic locations of these binding regions and concentration on the tumor cell surface would favor their interaction with laminin-1. Highly sulfated, iduronate-rich heparan sulfate oligosaccharide sequences such as these can be expected to adopt the characteristic heparin conformation (21Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Jones C. Davies D.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 393: 849-858Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar), in which clusters of sulfate groups are formed and are favorable to bind to basic amino acids on the protein surface. Modeled as an α-helix, the heparin-binding sequence in the G domain of laminin-1 (Fig.4 A) offers a linear array of basic residues well-placed to interact with these sulfate clusters (Fig. 4 B). Amphipathic α-helical peptides with high heparin affinity have previously been described in other proteins (29Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). This model of the heparin/laminin interaction remains tentative, and it is insufficiently detailed to explain the difference in affinity between the fully sulfated and slightly undersulfated dodecasaccharide fragments. The full heparin-binding site of laminin may also be more extensive, involving discontinuous segments of peptide sequence (30Margalit H Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A family of cell surface transmembrane HS proteoglycans, called syndecans (syndecan I through IV), have been reported to be synthesized by a variety of cells (31Rahmoune H. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 355SCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 32Salmivirta M. Jalkanen M. Experientia. 1995; 51: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In syndecans, HS chains are generally composed of a series of conserved sulfate-rich (mainlyN-sulfated) domains, containing IdoA(2-SO4) → GlcNSO4 ± (6-SO4) disaccharide units, interrupted by sulfate-poor (mainly N-acetylated) domains, with the relative proportions of these domains varying between different syndecans (33Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Laminin-1 high affinity dodecasaccharide is a sulfate-rich oligosaccharide, containing repeating disaccharide units of IdoA(2-SO4) → GlcNSO4(6-SO4), and is derived from the cell surface of MCF-7 cells. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that this oligosaccharide is part of the sulfate-rich domains of syndecan HS. Syndecan I particularly, has been shown to bind to laminin-1 via heparan sulfate chains (34Salmivirta M. Mali M. Heino J. Hermonen J. Jalkanen M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, even though MCF-7 cells synthesize heparan sulfate proteoglycans, it is unclear which of these syndecans carry the laminin-1-binding oligosaccharide in their HS chains. Aside from their central role in tumor-host adhesion in metastasis, laminin-HS interactions may have biological importance in basement membrane assembly due to the ubiquitous occurrence of HS proteoglycans and laminin in basement membranes and the fact that laminin-1 contains putative heparin-binding sites (9Timpl R. Brown J.C. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Perlecan, the predominant proteoglycan of basement membrane, is a HS proteoglycan and has been shown to bind to laminin-1 via its HS chains (35Battaglia C. Mayer U. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor heparan sulfate, most likely derived from perlecan, was shown to contain at least 80% of its sulfate residues inN-sulfated form (36Pejler G. Backstrom G. Lindahl U. Paulsson M. Dziadek M. Fujiwara S. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the disaccharide IdoA(2-SO4) → GlcNSO4(6-SO4) constitutes approximately 50% of the total disaccharide in Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor heparan sulfate. It is possible that laminin-perlecan interactions could involve the laminin high affinity dodecasaccharide, composed of IdoA(2-SO4) → GlcNSO4(6-SO4) repeating disaccharide units, and the G domain of laminin-1. Such ionic interactions could contribute to the macromolecular assembly of basement membrane (37Yurchenco P.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 195-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1979542194,"The DNA primase gene, dnaG, has been isolated from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 7942. It is not part of a macromolecular synthesis operon but is co-transcribed with pheT and located adjacent to the metallothionein divergon, smt. At the carboxyl terminus of this DnaG is a Cys2/His2 zinc-finger motif. The carboxyl-terminal 91 residues bound 65Zn and 0.95 g atom of Zn2+ mol−1 were detected with 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol.

Synechococcus PCC 7942 and its dnaG(C597S) mutant grew at equivalent rates, but the latter had a reduced number of chromosomes. Chromosome replication involves multiple, sequential, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. In Escherichia coli progress has been made in identifying what regulates the timing and duration of some of these interactions (1Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21398-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). InSynechococcus PCC 7942 there are differences in the mechanisms that regulate DNA synthesis compared with E. coli (2Binder B.J. Chisholm S.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 708-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A most obvious manifestation of modified regulation of DNA synthesis is a greater variability in DNA content with as many as 30 chromosomes in each cyanobacterial cell (3Mann N. Carr N.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1974; 83: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that in this organism a phenotype associated with modified rates of DNA replication would be modified DNA content. DNA primase, encoded by dnaG, synthesizes primer RNA required to initiate leading strand (4van der Ende A. Baker T.A. Ogawa T. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and to repeatedly reinitiate lagging strand (5Lark K. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 240: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) DNA synthesis. Each time primase is required it is recruited to the replication fork by protein-protein interaction with the DnaB helicase (6Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

It is the strength of this interaction that “sets the replication fork clock,” this being the principal regulator of the cycle of synthesis of Okazaki fragments (1Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Deletions and alanine cluster mutagenesis have established that it is the extreme carboxyl-terminal 8 amino acids of E. coli DNA primase that interact with the DnaB helicase (8Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21391-21397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations 12 and 15 residues away from the carboxyl terminus of DNA primase impair chromosome partitioning in E. coli (9Grompe M. Versalovic J. Koeuth T. Lupski J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a phenotype which Tougu and Marians (8Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21391-21397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have attributed to aberrant interaction with DnaB helicase. Purified DNA primase from E. coli contains tightly bound Zn2+ with an estimated stoichiometry close to 1:1 (10Stamford N.P.J. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Zn2+ binds to a conserved motif which is near to the amino terminus of all known bacterial and bacteriophage DNA primase sequences (11Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol.

This amino-terminal Zn2+-binding motif is implicated in DNA recognition, although it is not the sole determinant of DNA sequence recognition (14Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

The presence of a predicted zinc-finger at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the deduced DNA primase, in addition to the conserved amino-terminal Zn2+-binding motif found in other DNA primases, is of particular interest due to (i) the known roles of such structures in protein-protein (15Berg J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6513-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as protein-RNA and protein-DNA (16Shi Y. Berg J.M. Science. 1995; 268: 282-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) interactions, (ii) the importance of the protein-protein interactions mediated by the equivalent region of E. coli DNA primase (which does not contain a carboxyl-terminal zinc-finger motif), (iii) the fact that such eukaryotic style zinc-fingers have not yet been structurally characterized in prokaryotes and furthermore it has been suggested that by avoiding such structures prokaryotes may have avoided the “hidden cost” of precise Zn2+ homeostasis (17Luisi B. Nature. 1992; 356: 379-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and (iv) the close proximity of the gene to the cyanobacterial MT gene,smtA, which is known to act as a regulator of the availability of endogenous Zn2+ in SynechococcusPCC 7942 (18Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were therefore performed to test whether or not the carboxyl-terminal region of DNA primase fromSynechococcus PCC 7942 does bind Zn2+ and if Zn2+ association induces the formation of the protein structure. These two predictions have been confirmed in vitro using recombinant polypeptides. macromolecular synthesis base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) metallothionein 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol p-(hydroxymercuri)phenylsulfonate polymerase chain reaction. macromolecular synthesis base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) metallothionein 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol p-(hydroxymercuri)phenylsulfonate polymerase chain reaction. The functional significance of the zinc-finger motif was then testedin vivo. There are precedents for the analysis, bothin vitro and in vivo, of proteins containing mutant zinc-fingers with impaired Zn2+ binding (19Landro J.A. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20217-20220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Liu J. Gagnon Y. Gauthier J. Furenlid L. L'Heureux P.-J. Auger M. Nureki O. Yokoyama S. Lapointe J. J. Biol.

Substitution of a Ser residue for either the second, or fourth, Cys in a Cys4-type zinc-finger within isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, impaired (but did not abolish) Zn2+ binding in vitro and conferred Zn2+-dependent cell growth in E. coli (19Landro J.A. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20217-20220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously generated mutants deficient in smt via homologous recombination-mediated insertion of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, cat (18Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants are hypersensitive to Zn2+, and reintegration of smt into these cells has been used as a selectable marker since it restores normal Zn2+ tolerance (18Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Turner J.S. Robinson N.J. Gupta A. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1995; 14: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that a mutant 3′ end of dnaGcould be co-integrated with smt to create cells containing only a single codon substitution within the chromosomal region encoding the zinc-finger motif of DNA primase. It has indeed been possible to specifically, and exclusively, substitute a Ser codon for the second Cys codon within the part of dnaG encoding the zinc-finger motif within the chromosome of Synechococcus PCC 7942. These cells have a reduced DNA content showing that the thiol group on this residue, and hence the Cys2/His2-type zinc-finger motif, influences chromosome replication. Cyanobacterial strains used were: R2-PIM8, a small plasmid-cured derivative ofSynechococcus PCC 7942 (23van der Plas J. Hegeman H. de Vrieze G. Tuyl M. Borrias M. Weisbeek P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 95: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), referred to herein as “wild-type”; and R2-PIM8(smt), ansmt-deficient mutant (18Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strains were cultured as described previously (18Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and supplemented with 5 μg of kanamycin ml−1 as appropriate. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were supplied by New England Biolabs, [α-32P]dCTP and nylon (Hybond N+) filters were obtained from Amersham International plc., and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid pJSTNR4.1, containing smt- flanking sequences and pSU19 (24Martinez E. Bartolomé B. de la Cruz F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 68: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), was generated previously by plasmid recovery into E. coli, using DNA from R2-PIM8(smt) (18Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction fragments (∼0.5 kb) of pJSTNR4.1 were recovered from agarose gels, subcloned into appropriate sites of pSU19 or pGEM3z (Promega), and sequenced as described previously (25Huckle J.W. Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Robinson N.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) with reaction products analyzed using an Applied Biosystems 370A DNA sequence analyzer. For each insert, one strand was sequenced at least twice, and the complementary strand at least once. Plasmid pJSTNR4.1 was used as template DNA in PCR reactions with 5′ primer I (5′-CTTGGATCCGGATGTATCAAGTCGAGCG-3′; Fig.1) and an M13 forward primer. The PCR amplification product (0.71 kb), which contained the 3′ end ofdnaG, was ligated to pGEM-T (Promega) prior to subcloning into the BamHI/SmaI site of the glutathioneS-transferase gene fusion vector pGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotech Ltd) to create pGEXAB1.1, and checked by sequence analysis. Recombinant fusion protein was expressed and purified as described previously (26Tommey A.M. Shi J. Lindsay W.P. Urwin P.E. Robinson N.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 49-52Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal 91 amino acids of DNA primase and 3 residues of glutathione S-transferase (p10.5) were released from glutathione-Sepharose-bound glutathione S-transferase by incubation overnight with factor Xa (Pharmacia). A truncated version of p10.5 (p7.5), lacking the carboxyl-terminal 24 amino acids of DNA primase, was generated by converting a CGC codon (Arg592) to a UGA stop codon. Primers 5′-GGTGGAACGACTGTGATGCGAAAAACGTTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAACGTTTTTCGCATCACAGTCGTTCCACC-3′ were used for site-directed mutagenesis via “Quik-change” (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The identity and purity of all recombinant proteins was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Recombinant p10.5, in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with ∼17 kBq 65Zn before fractionation on Sephadex G-25. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and aliquots (0.1 ml) were analyzed for protein content and radioactivity. An aliquot of the protein was hydrolyzed and analyzed for amino acid composition (Alta Bioscience, University of Birmingham) to allow calibration of colorimetric estimations of p10.5. The amount of Zn2+ or Cd2+ bound to p10.5 or p7.5, purified from E. coli grown in the presence or absence of permissive concentrations of Zn2+ (200 μm) or Cd2+ (250 μm), was determined immediately upon elution from glutathione-Sepharose by addition of 0.1 mm PAR and incubation for 5 min with aliquots (5 μl) of 0.5 μm PMPS in the range of 0 to 6 equivalents. The metallochromic indicator PAR generates colored chelate compounds with Zn2+ (27Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Cd2+ (28Jezorek J.R. Freiser H. Anal. Chem. 1979; 51: 373-376Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Metal ion release was monitored by the increase (subtracting values prior to the addition of PMPS) in absorbance at 500 nm (27Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and values calibrated by reacting known amounts of Zn2+ or Cd2+ with PAR. In addition, an aliquot of p10.5, isolated from Cd2+ exposed cells, was incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of Cd2+ in vitro and unbound metal removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 prior to determining metal content. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 20 °C using a SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer operating in the ratio mode with spectral bandwidths of 8 nm for both excitation and emission. Excitation wavelength was set to 280 nm. Intensities were measured between 296 and 430 nm before and after the addition of a 40-fold molar excess of Zn2+ or EDTA to ∼50 μg ml−1 p10.5. The Raman scatter contribution was eliminated by subtraction of appropriate blanks. PCR was performed using pJSTNR4.1 as template with primers II (5′-ACTTGCATGCTTCTTGGCGGTGATC-3′) and VIII (Fig. 1), and the amplification product (2.6 kb), containing dnaG and part ofpheT, was ligated to pGEM-T. PCR was subsequently performed using primer III (5′-CTTGGATCCACGGTGACGACTTAG-3′; Fig. 1) with an M13 forward primer (which anneals within pSU19 sequences of pJSTNR4.1). This amplification product (0.7 kb), containing the 3′ end ofdnaG and downstream sequences, was ligated to pGEM-T prior to subcloning into the BamHI/SacI site of pSU19 containing neo (a kanamycin-resistance gene). A 2.2-kbSalI/SacI fragment, containing neo and the 3′ end of dnaG, was subsequently released and subcloned into pGEM-T containing the initial 2.6-kb fragment. A 0.5-kbHincII fragment containing part of dnaG was then removed to generate pABNR1.1. A 4.3-kb ApaI/SacI fragment of pABNR1.1, containing the resulting 2.1- and 0.7-kb fragments of Synechococcus PCC 7942 genomic DNA separated byneo (1.5 kb), was used to transform SynechococcusPCC 7942 to kanamycin resistance. Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (18Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Southern analyses were performed using standard protocols (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes used to confirm inactivation of dnaG were: A, a 1.5-kb fragment of DNA containing neo; B, a 0.2-kb PCR product containing a region of dnaG deleted from pABNR1.1 generated using primers IV (5′-CTTCCATGGTCAGGCTAGC-3′) and V (5′-GCTGCAAAGCCAAGGTGC-3′) (Fig. 1); C, a 0.3-kb BamHI/HindIII fragment released from pABNR1.1 containing retained sequences to the 3′ ofdnaG; and D, a 0.7-kb PstI/HindIII fragment released from pABNR1.1 containing retained 5′-flanking sequences. The DNA contents of logarithmically growing cultures were determined. Cells were subcultured at 48-h intervals, to an optical density at 595 nm of 0.03 (∼1 × 106 cells ml−1), for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to analyses. DNA was extracted based on a method described by Mann and Carr (3Mann N. Carr N.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1974; 83: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and quantified by the diphenylamine assay of Burton (30Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (10814) Google Scholar), calibrated withd-deoxyribose standards. Assays were carried out in triplicate, and the entire experiment was repeated on at least three separate occasions with independent cultures. A 1.8-kbHindIII/SalI fragment of DNA was released from plasmid pJHNR49 (a product of a size fractionatedSynechococcus PCC 7942 genomic library described in Huckleet al. (25Huckle J.W. Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Robinson N.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)), and a 3.7-kbBamHI/HindIII fragment of DNA was released from plasmid pRCNR01 (a 3.7-kb SalI/HindIII genomic fragment in the vector pGEM3z). The fragments were ligated into the vector pSK+ (Stratagene) to create pABNR2.1 (Fig. 1). A single nucleotide change (C597S) was introduced using the primers 5′-GCAAATGGCGGGAACGTTTTTCGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGCGAAAAACGTTCCCGCCATTTGC-3′ via Quik-change. However, due to the relatively large size of pABNR2.1 there is a high probability of single strand breaks and hence a low ratio of nascent:template DNA following DNA synthesis in the Quik-change protocol. This will increase the amount of hemimethylated plasmid DNA containing one strand of mutant, nascent DNA, and one strand of methylated template. Hemimethylated DNA is inefficiently digested with DpnI (17Luisi B. Nature. 1992; 356: 379-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and such plasmids will be reverted to the original sequence by the mismatch repair system inE. coli. Hence products were introduced into a mismatch repair-deficient strain of E. coli, XL mutS(Stratagene), prior to introduction into Epicurian E. coliXL1-Blue (Stratagene). Plasmids containing the single nucleotide change were selected by sequence analysis and designated pABNR2.2. A 5.5-kbSalI fragment of Synechococcus PCC 7942 genomic DNA was released from pABNR2.2 (Fig. 1) and used to transform R2-PIM8(smt) to Zn2+ tolerance. Putative mutants were selected by growth on Allens plates supplemented with 15 μm Zn2+. DNA isolated from two Zn2+-resistant clones was digested with SalI, and integration of the 5.5-kb fragment was confirmed using Southern analysis. The probes used were a 0.8-kbSacII/NcoI fragment of pSU19 containing thecat gene and a 0.2-kb smtA fragment produced using primers VI (5′-CGCGGATCCTCATGACCTCAACA-3′) and VII (5′-CCGGAATTCGGATTAGCAGGGAAACAGT-3′) (Fig. 1) with pJHNR49 as a template. To confirm co-integration of the dnaG(C597S) mutation, the carboxyl-terminal region of dnaG was amplified using primers VIII (5′-TCAATGCAAATGTTCAAAGG-3′) and IX (5′-CATGTATCAAGTCGAGCG-3′) (Fig. 1) with genomic DNA as a template, ligated to pGEM-T, and sequenced. Sequences upstream of the MT divergon, smt, have been determined (GenBankTM accession no. X94247). These contain an open reading frame encoding a protein with similarity to known bacterial DNA primases, which has therefore been designateddnaG. Immediately upstream of dnaG is an open reading frame encoding a protein with sequence similarity to PheT, a subunit of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (Fig.2). Reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed co-transcription of pheT and dnaG inSynechococcus PCC 7942 (data not shown). In E. coli, and many other bacteria (33Versalovic J. Koeuth T. Britton R. Geszvain K. Lupski J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), dnaG is located within the MMS operon (34Burton Z.F. Gross G.A. Watanabe K.K. Burgess R.R. Cell. 1983; 32: 335-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 35Lupski J.R. Godson G.N. Cell. 1984; 39: 251-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The MMS operon contains the genesrpsU-dnaG-rpoD whose products (S21, DNA primase, ς70 subunit of RNA polymerase) are required to initiate protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis. Fig. 2 A illustrates the arrangement, and transcription, of genes in the region ofdnaG in Synechococcus PCC 7942 and compares this with the more typical gene architecture exemplified by the MMS operon of E. coli (Fig. 2 C). The carboxyl-terminal region of DNA primase from SynechococcusPCC 7942 is predicted (using the “motifs” program) to form a eukaryotic type Cys2/His2 zinc-finger (Fig.2 B). Such a carboxyl-terminal zinc-finger motif is not found in other primases (Fig. 2 D) and therefore recombinant polypeptides were generated to investigate proposed metal-association with this region. Recombinant p10.5 was extracted from E. coli (JM101) cells containing the plasmid pGEXAB1.1. Purified recombinant p10.5 was incubated for 2 h with 65Zn before fractionation on Sephadex G-25. Protein and 65Zn co-eluted in the void volume (fractions 7–11) with no free65Zn detected in the total volume (fractions 12–25), the elution volume for the latter being identified by subsequent resolution of an aliquot of 65Zn (Fig.3). Upon Cys modification of p10.5 an increase inA500 (ΔA500) was observed to 2 mol equivalents of PMPS (Fig.4). By using calibration curves, reacting known amounts of Zn2+ with PAR, it was estimated that only 0.04 (± 0.01) g atom of Zn2+ was released mol−1 of p10.5 upon addition of PMPS (TableI). The analysis was repeated using p10.5 extracted from cells supplemented with 200 μmZn2+. While the p10.5 yield declined, the stoichiometry increased (Fig. 4 B), but the latter remained substantially less than 1:1. It was initially hypothesized that this could be due to relative insolubility of the metallated-, compared with apo-, p10.5 since insolubility of a Zn2+-saturated prokaryotic Zn2+-binding protein expressed in E. coli has been reported (36Pountney D.L. Tiwari R.P. Eyan J.B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In previous studies of a metal-saturated prokaryotic protein containing a Cys4-type Zn2+-binding domain, such insolubility problems were overcome by using Cd2+ as an analogue of Zn2+(36Pountney D.L. Tiwari R.P. Eyan J.B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cys2/His2 zinc-fingers can bind one equivalent of Cd2+ (37Kuwahara J. Coleman J.E.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10094-10100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and there are precedents for the metal ions being introduced either by in vitro exchange and/or following growth of E. coli cells in Cd2+supplemented medium (39Xu B. Trawick B. Krudy G.A. Phillips R.M. Zhou L. Rosevear P.R.

Means and standard deviations of the sets of triplicate estimations of metal contents of p10.5 are shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The total amount of metal displaced from p10.5, or p7.5, by saturating amounts of PMPS was determined for independent protein preparations. Means and standard deviations of the sets of triplicate estimations of metal contents of p10.5 are shown in parentheses. There was a greater than 4-fold reduction in p10.5 yield following exposure of E. coli to 250 μm Cd2+(Table I), but titration with PMPS released a greater amount of metal (Fig. 4 C). The mean estimated stoichiometry was 0.95 (±0.10), a value close to 1:1 (Table I). An aliquot of the recombinant protein purified from cells exposed to 250 μmCd2+ was also incubated in vitro with a 2-fold molar excess of Cd2+ and again titrated with PMPS (Fig.4 D) to obtain an estimated stoichiometry of 0.87 (Table I). Equivalent analyses were performed with p7.5, which is truncated and does not contain the zinc-finger motif. Only trace amounts of Cd2+, 0.03 g atom mol−1 (Table I), were displaced from p7.5 (Fig. 4 C). It was noted that an immediate color change (prior to addition of PMPS) observed when p10.5 isolated from Zn2+ exposed cells was incubated with PAR, was not apparent with p10.5 (or p7.5) from Cd2+-exposed cells. Thus an alternative explanation for the low estimated Zn2+ stoichiometry is that a proportion of the Zn2+ (but not Cd2+) associated with the purified p10.5 is accessible to PAR prior to the addition of PMPS. The amount of Zn2+ reacting with PAR prior to the addition of PMPS was therefore quantified. Two separate preparations gave 0.86 and 0.81 g atom Zn2+ mol−1 p10.5, with a further 0.10 and 0.12 g atom, respectively, detected after addition of saturating amounts of PMPS. This suggests Zn2+stoichiometries of 0.96:1 and 0.93:1 (mean value of 0.95:1). Use of radiotracer, and PMPS titrations, revealed that Zn2+ (or Cd2+) associate with p10.5, and furthermore this involves the carboxyl-terminal 24 residues and at least two of the residues (the Cys residues) predicted to form a zinc-finger. Protein fluorescence was therefore used to test whether Zn2+ association induces formation of protein structure in the region of the zinc-finger motif. The p10.5 polypeptide is amenable to fluorescence studies due to the presence of a single Trp residue at the tip of the predicted loop with none elsewhere in p10.5 (Fig. 2 B). An increase in intensity combined with a reduction in the wavelength (blue shift) of fluorescence was always observed when p10.5 was titrated with Zn2+ (Fig. 5). Subsequent addition of EDTA always resulted in a diminution in intensity and an increase in the wavelength of fluorescence. Fig. 5 shows an initial spectrum and final spectra after titration of p10.5 with saturating amounts of Zn2+ followed by saturating amounts of EDTA. Calculating the difference between the baricentric means of the corrected emission spectra gave an overall shift of 2.48 (±0.90) nm. This value represents the difference between the minimum (after titration with Zn2+) and maximum baricentric means for three preparations of p10.5, noting that in one preparation the magnitude of the Zn2+-induced blue shift exceeded the subsequent EDTA-induced red shift and for this sample the initial mean gave the maximum wavelength. It was speculated that a phenotype associated with impaired action of dnaG in this organism"
https://openalex.org/W2023603171,"A 5.4-kilobase mRNA, the expression of which is down-regulated after treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with various T cell-activating agents, was isolated using an mRNA differential display method. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified the 5′ end of this RNA as human retinoid receptor RXRα mRNA. Here, we report the nucleotide sequence of 3.6 kilobases of this RNA, which represents the 3′ end of RXRα mRNA, the sequence of which has not been previously described. Activated PBMCs also expressed lower levels of RXRα protein, and a DNA binding assay showed that the activation-induced loss of RXRα mRNA and protein expression correlated with the loss of DNA binding activity of this protein. We present evidence that the transition from G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle results in the down-regulation of RXRα expression and that cell cycle inhibitors, which block the cells in G1 phase, prevent this down-regulation. The decrease in the levels of RXRα mRNA was found to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level and involved new protein synthesis. These observations indicate that the levels of RXRα expression in T lymphocytes are coupled to cell cycle progression, and there is tight regulatory control of RXRα expression during the transition from G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. A 5.4-kilobase mRNA, the expression of which is down-regulated after treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with various T cell-activating agents, was isolated using an mRNA differential display method. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified the 5′ end of this RNA as human retinoid receptor RXRα mRNA.

During the physiological response to antigens, T cells are activated through the interaction of the processed antigen with the TCR·CD3 complex, resulting in a complex signaling pathway that culminates in cellular proliferation and a specific immune response. The activation of T cells is a highly regulated process, which involves transcriptional control of many genes (1Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev.

The activation of resting peripheral blood T cells by TCR·CD3 ligation can be mimicked by treatment with phorbol myristate and ionomycin (ION), which induce protein kinase C activation and an increase in the intracellular calcium pool (10Lindsten T. June C.H. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, lectins like phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or concanavalin A can induce T cell activation in normal peripheral blood T cells (9Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 7.10.1-7.10.10Google Scholar). Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are a group of nuclear receptors involved in retinoic acid-mediated gene activation (11Mangelsdorf D.J. Man J. Kliewer S.A. Kakizuka A. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 99-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, these receptors exert their action by binding, as homodimers or heterodimers, to specific sequences in the promoters of target genes and regulate their transcription. Retinoid receptor functions can also be mediated by a pathway that does not require receptor-DNA interaction. This mechanism involves interaction of nuclear receptors and the transcription factor AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos), which results in the inhibition of AP-1 activity (13Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that retinoic acid inhibits activation-induced apoptosis in T cell hybridomas and thymocytes, and RXRs may have a role in this protection (14Iwata M. Mukai M. Nakai Y.

To understand the molecular basis of T cell activation, the analysis of changes in gene expression after activation is of prime importance. We are interested in the identification of genes that are involved in T cell activation, proliferation, and cell death. A recently described PCR-based method called differential display PCR (18Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar, 19Welsh J. Chada K. Dalal S.S.

In this report using differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (DD-RT-PCR), we describe the isolation of an approximately 5.4-kb mRNA from human PBMCs, the expression of which is down-regulated after treatment of PBMCs or purified T lymphocytes with various T cell-activating agents. Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that the 5′ end of this mRNA (approximately 1.8 kb) is homologous to the published sequences of human RXRα, and the 3′ end (approximately 3.6 kb) does not match any sequences in the GenBank except some expressed sequence tags. We show that this 3.6-kb sequence represents the 3′ end of the human RXRα mRNA, the sequence of which has not been previously reported in the literature. We also provide evidence that the activation-induced down-regulation of expression of RXRα can be prevented by treatments that block cells in G1 phase and prevent activation and transition into the S phase of the cell cycle, indicating cell cycle regulation of RXRα expression in T cells. Human PBMCs obtained by lymphapheresis of healthy donors were purified by Histopaque (Sigma) density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs were maintained in RPMI medium (Biowhitaker, Frederick, MD) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES buffer, 2 mml-glutamine, 60 μg/ml gentamicin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were isolated using Dynal beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). The resulting cell populations were greater than 97% CD3-positive as monitored by flow cytometry. Cells (106/ml) were treated with OKT3 (Ortho-Biotech) or anti-TCR αβ (T Cell Diagnostics, Woburn, MA) antibodies immobilized on polystyrene surfaces. Antibodies (10 μg/ml in PBS) were immobilized by incubating in polystyrene tissue culture flasks at 37 °C for 3–5 h. PHA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and ionomycin (ION) were from Sigma and were used at 2.5 μg/ml, 10 ng/ml, and 350 ng/ml, respectively. rIL-2 (Boehringer Mannheim) was used at 20–30 units/ml. Cyclosporin A (CsA) and rapamycin (RAP) (Biomol, Plymouth, PA) were used at 2.5 and 1 μg/ml, respectively. Mimosine (Biomol) was used at 100 and 25 μg/ml for 24- and 72-h cultures, respectively. Actinomycin D (Act D) and cycloheximide (CHX) were from Sigma and were used at 2.5 and 10 μg/ml, respectively. After 65 h of incubation with different agents, cells were treated in duplicate with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine/ml and incubated for an additional 4–6 h; the incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined by liquid scintillation counting. DD-RT-PCR was done in duplicate with 300 and 600 ng of total RNA from untreated and OKT3-treated PBMCs using instructions and primers from a Differential Display Kit purchased from Display Systems (Los Angeles). The 5′ and 3′ ends of mRNA were isolated by using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) procedure (23Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) and a PromoterFinder DNA walking kit (CLONTECH). PCR products were cloned and sequenced using the ABI automatic DNA sequencer (model 377). The most updated nucleic acid data banks (GenBank and Entrez) were searched using GCG software (University of Wisconsin). RNase protection assay was performed using RiboQuant Multi-Probe RNase protection system kit purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego). The RXRα probe was generated from pNotA/T7 plasmid (5 Prime → 3 Prime) in which a 302-base pair PCR fragment of RXRα cDNA was cloned (the cDNA fragment was generated by RT-PCR using primers from the newly isolated sequence; see below). Control plasmids containing GAPDH and L32 cDNA sequences were purchased from Pharmingen. All three plasmids were transcribed in a single tube using T7 RNA polymerase according to the instructions in the kit. RNase protection was performed using total RNA, and the products were resolved in 8 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and scanned using a bio-imaging analyzer (Bas 1000, Fuji) and also exposed to x-ray films. The equal amount of RNA used for RT-PCR was determined from absorbance at 260 nm (A260), the intensity of the total RNA bands on an agarose gel, and bands obtained after RT-PCR of 18 S ribosomal RNA, the expression of which was not affected by any of the treatments in this study. The analysis of the PCR products was done when the reactions were in the linear range and the amount of product was directly proportional to the amount of input cDNA. This was accomplished by quantitating the product accumulation at different cycle numbers. Under the conditions described, 750–24,000 copies of RXRα DNA could be amplified in the linear range. Half a microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed in duplicate with 200 units of Superscript II RNase H−reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 2.5 μm random hexamers. PCR was performed for 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP, and the products were electrophoresed in 6% precast polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego). The gels were dried and scanned for quantitation of the PCR products using a bio-imaging analyzer (Bas 1000, Fuji). Primer pairs used for RXRα PCR were 5′-AGGGCTGGGACTGTTTCG (5000–5017), 5′-CCACGATGTTTCAGAGACAATCGTACG (5301–5275) from the newly isolated sequence, and 5′-CCATAAGGAAGGTGTCAATGG (1412–1432), 5′-AGAAGGTCTATGCGTCCTTGG (1276 -1256) from the published sequence (24Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). The primer pair for 18 S rRNA was 5′-CGAAGACGATCAGATACCGTCGTAG (1047–1071) and 5′-GGGCATCACAGACCTGTTATTGCTC (1503–1479) (25McCallum F.S. Maden B.E.H. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Primers for IL2 receptor were 5′-ATCAGCGTCCTCCTCCTGAGT (931–951) and 5′-CAAGCACAACGGATGTCTCC (1116–1097) (26Nikaido T. Shimizu A. Ishida N. Sabe H. Teshigawara K. Maeda M. Uchiyama T. Yodoi T.J. Honjo T. Nature. 1984; 311: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). 100 μg of protein were electrophoresed in a 10% NuPAGE Bis Tris gel using NuPAGE MOPS-SDS running buffer (Novex) and transferred to polyvinyldifluoride membrane using XCell blot module (Novex). The membrane was blocked with Blocker Blotto (Pierce) and treated overnight at 4 °C with 1:1000 dilution of RXRα (D-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 2–21 of human RXRα, or 1:2000 dilution of a monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma). Proteins were detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The DNA binding activity of RXRs was studied by EMSA using oligonucleotides corresponding to CRBPII RXRE (AGCTTCAGGTCAGAGGTCAGAGAGCT). AP-1 binding activity was determined using the triplet AP-1 consensus sequence TGACTCATGACTCATGACTCA and the AP-1 mutant sequence CGACTCGCGACTCGCGACTCG. Sp1 binding activity was determined using the sequence ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC. 2–5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 0.5 μg poly(dI-dC) in 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA,1 mm MgCl2, and 4% glycerol in a total volume of 10 μl followed by the addition of 1 ng of 32P end-labeled probe for 20 min at room temperature. For the competition experiment, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe was added before the addition of the 32P end-labeled probe. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved in a 6% DNA retardation gel (Novex). The gels were dried and scanned for quantitation using a bio-imaging analyzer (Bas 1000, Fuji) and also exposed to x-ray films. 108 cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40) and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted, washed once, and stored in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA at −130 °C. Transcription was performed for 45 min at 30 °C with 200 μl of nuclei in the presence of 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 0.25 mm each of ATP, GTP, UTP, and 200 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3,000 Ci/mmol). The mixture was treated with 150 units of RQ1 DNase (Promega) and incubated for another 15 min followed by treatment with 10 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 45 min. RNA was isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and heated for 10 min at 95 °C before hybridization. Equivalent amounts of radioactivity were hybridized to nylon membranes on which 10 μg of various linearized and denatured plasmids were slot blotted. Hybridizations were performed for 3 days at 42 °C in 6 × SSPE, 1 × Denhardt, 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide, 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and washed at 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 56 °C. The membranes were scanned for quantitation using a bio-imaging analyzer (Bas 1000, Fuji) and also exposed to x-ray films. For DNA content measurement, the cells were fixed in 70% ethanol on ice for 30 min, washed with PBS, and incubated with 200 units/ml DNase-free RNase for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and analyzed with a Coulter flow cytometer using an argon laser. Debris and doublets were excluded by electronic gating on a cytogram drawn from the peakversus linear PI signal. Histograms of DNA content of the gated events were drawn using the Multicycle program. Electrophoretic analysis of OKT3-treated and untreated DD-RT-PCR products revealed a complex pattern of different cDNAs. A number of differentially amplified products were cloned and sequenced. One of them (designated clone 5), which was down-regulated in OKT3-treated PBMCs (Fig.1) and was not related to any known sequence in the GenBank, was further studied. Northern blot hybridization using the clone 5 cDNA probe identified this RNA as an approximately 5.4-kb RNA that was expressed in PBMCs and also in a number of human tissues like spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, and colon (data not shown). Based on the sequence information obtained from the clone 5, 3′ and 5′ ends of this RNA were isolated using RACE. An approximately 450-base pair sequence (excluding the poly(A) tail) was identified by 3′ RACE, and 3.1 kb of cDNA sequence was obtained by 5′ RACE and 5′ genomic DNA walking, followed by RT-PCR using primers from genomic DNA sequences. Comparison of these sequences revealed that about 200 nucleotides from the 5′ end of this newly isolated cDNA were identical to human RXRα (24Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). RXRα mRNA has been characterized as a 5.4-kb mRNA, but only about 1.8 kb of the mRNA sequence has been reported (24Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). RT-PCR using primers from the newly isolated sequences and the published regions of RXRα yielded the expected size cDNA PCR products, and sequence analysis of these PCR products established that the newly isolated sequence was indeed the 3′ end of human RXRα mRNA. This was further confirmed by Northern blot hybridization using an RXRα cDNA probe prepared by PCR using the primers from the published RXRα cDNA sequences. This probe hybridized to the same 5.4-kb RNA as did the probe from the newly isolated sequence (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the newly isolated RNA (approximately 3.6 kb) showed two additional open reading frames designated ORF-2 (2125–2877) and ORF-3 (4260–4754), which can code for polypeptides of 251 and 165 amino acids, respectively (data not shown). Treatment of PBMCs with anti-CD3 antibodies resulted in the activation of T cells as shown by [3H]thymidine incorporation. RNase protection assay (Fig.2 A) and RT-PCR (using primers from the newly isolated sequence and from the published RXRα sequence) were used to estimate the relative levels of RXRα mRNA. There was an approximately 90% decrease in the levels of RXRα mRNA when PBMCs were treated with OKT3 for 72 h. Fig.2 B shows the kinetics of this down-regulation. The data show that there was a 70% decrease in the RXRα mRNA levels in first 24 h and, after 72 h of OKT3 treatment, a 90–95% reduction in the level of the RXRα mRNA. For comparison, cDNA samples were also amplified with IL2-receptor specific primers that served as an activation marker. To demonstrate that the down-regulation of RXRα mRNA was T cell-specific, purified CD4+/CD8+ T cells were treated with OKT3 or the combination of PMA + ION, known to induce T cell activation (10Lindsten T. June C.H. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The levels of RXRα mRNA were reduced in the purified T cells after both treatments (data not shown). Western blot analysis revealed that the OKT3-induced down-regulation of RXRα was also observed at the protein level (Fig. 3).Figure 3Expression of RXRα protein in PBMCs after OKT3 activation. PBMCs (106/ml) were treated with OKT3 in the presence or absence of CsA. After 72 h, cells were harvested, lysates were made, and 100 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer to a membrane, RXRα protein was detected by RXRα (D-20) antibody using ECL Western blotting detection system from Amersham. Lanes 1–3 are, respectively, untreated, OKT3 treated-, and OKT3 + CsA-treated lysates. In lane 4, 12.5 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extract-phorbol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were loaded as a positive control for the detection of RXRα protein. The membrane was also blotted with an anti-α-tubulin antibody to demonstrate that equal amount of protein was loaded in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether the decrease in the RXRα mRNA expression, seen after CD3 cross-linking of PBMCs, could also be achieved by stimulating cells with other known T cell-proliferating agents, we treated PBMCs with immobilized monoclonal anti-TCR αβ antibody, PMA +ION, PHA, concanavalin A, IL2, or PHA + IL2 (Fig. 4 A). RT-PCR data show that all of these treatments resulted in a decrease in RXRα mRNA levels when compared with untreated cells (Fig.4 B). The extent of RXRα mRNA down-regulation differed between the treatments. Results presented in Fig. 4 C show the relative effectiveness of different activating agents in inducing the down-regulation of RXRα mRNA expression. Retinoid receptors bind to specific DNA sequences called retinoic acid response elements (RAREs). The core motif of these RAREs is AGGTCA. Using natural and synthetic RAREs, it has been shown that RXRs preferentially bind and activate direct repeat elements in which core motifs are separated by 1 or 2 base pairs (28Mangelsdorf D.J.

Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). To determine if the down-regulation of RXRα levels after activation were reflected in a comparable difference in DNA binding activity of this protein, the DNA binding activity was studied by EMSA using oligonucleotides corresponding to CRBPII RXRE. As can be seen from Fig.5, there is almost complete loss of DNA binding activity after the treatment of PBMCs with OKT3. When the same nuclear extracts were analyzed for AP-1 binding by EMSA, there was 6-fold increase in the AP-1 binding activity of OKT3-treated PBMCs. The levels of a constitutively expressed transcription factor Sp1 (31Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar) showed only a moderate increase (less than 2-fold) after activation, indicating that the integrity and the amount of nuclear extracts derived from activated PBMCs were comparable with that from untreated cells. These data indicate that T cell activation, which is associated with a marked increase in AP-1 binding activity, nevertheless results in the loss of RXR binding activity. Thus, activation-induced loss of RXRα mRNA and protein expression in T cells correlates with the loss of DNA binding activity of this protein. To study the fate of RXRα mRNA expression in actively proliferating human T cells, freshly isolated PBMCs were treated with PHA and IL2 for 3–4 days. The cells were washed to remove the PHA and maintained in IL2. Flow cytometry revealed that the proliferating cells were >98% CD3+ T lymphocytes. The kinetics of alteration of RXRα mRNA expression (Fig.6) showed 75% down-regulation after 4 days of PHA + IL2 treatment (when the cells had started to divide), and by day 10 when the cells were actively proliferating, the levels of RXRα mRNA had reached 10% of the levels seen in resting cells. This low level expression of RXRα mRNA was maintained throughout T cell proliferation. These results indicate that the expression of RXRα in T lymphocytes may be cell cycle-regulated. CsA inhibits T cell activation by inhibiting calcineurin (a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase), which, in turn, inhibits the transcription of IL2. Because the binding of IL2 to its receptor is important for the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle (32Smith K.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), signaling through the IL2 receptor is inhibited in the absence of IL2, and the cells are prevented from entering into the S phase of the cell cycle. RAP does not affect the production of IL2 but does inhibit signals transmitted via the IL2 receptor at least in part by inhibiting the IL2-induced phosphorylation and activation of p70S6K(33Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1992; 70: 365-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In the presence of RAP, IL2-stimulated T cells are blocked in G1 (34Terada N. Takase K. Papst P. Nairn A.C.

Measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig.4 A) showed that both CsA and RAP inhibited cellular activation induced by TCR·CD3 cross-linking. This was accompanied by inhibition of activation-induced down-regulation of RXRα mRNA expression (Fig. 4 B). CsA was more effective than RAP in preventing the down-regulation of RXRα mRNA expression induced by OKT3. In addition, CsA inhibited the down-regulation of RXRα mRNA expression induced by anti-TCR αβ antibody (Fig.4 C). CsA inhibition of OKT3-induced RXRα down-regulation was completely prevented by the addition of IL2 (Fig.7 A), suggesting that IL2 may be necessary for the activation-induced decrease in RXRα. To study the possibility that the IL2 effect may be mediated by regulation of the cell cycle, we treated PBMCs with OKT3 in the presence of mimosine, a rare plant amino acid that blocks the cell cycle at the G1 phase by inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor 5-A (eIF5-A) (35Hanauske-Abel H.M. Park H.M. Hanauske A.R. Popowicz A.M. Lalande M. Folke J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Table I), either alone or in combination with IL2. As shown in Fig. 7 A, mimosine completely inhibited the OKT3-induced down-regulation of RXRα expression. IL2 had no effect in preventing this inhibition. Consistent with the inability of IL2 to release the G1 block induced by mimosine (Table I), the inhibition of RXRα down-regulation could not be prevented by treatment with IL2. These data indicate that the cell cycle block in the G1 phase accounted for the inhibition of activation-induced down-regulation induced by CsA, RAP, and mimosine. Moreover, the effect of IL2 in preventing the CsA-induced inhibition of RXRα down-regulation was correlated to the release of the CsA-induced G1 block (Table I). Further proof that the levels of RXRα are cell cycle-regulated came from the experiment in which actively dividing peripheral T lymphocytes, which express low levels of RXRα mRNA as compared with the resting cells, were treated with mimosine for 24 h. Treatment with mimosine blocked the cells in G1 phase and resulted in a marked up-regulation of RXRα mRNA. When the mimosine block was released to allow progression into the cell cycle, the levels of RXRα mRNA decreased progressively and, in 24 h after release, reached the levels seen in actively cycling untreated cells (Fig.7 B).Table ICell cycle analysis of CsA and mimosine-treated PBMCsPBMCsG0/G1G2S%Untreated94.73.22.1OKT374.34.721OKT3 + CsA97.80.31.9OKT3 + CsA + IL275.35.619.1OKT3 + mimosine95.72.12.2OKT3 + mimosine + IL294.35.70 Open table in a new tab To study the involvement of transcriptional or post-transcriptional factors in the regulation of RXRα mRNA expression during T cell activation and transition from G0/G1 to the S phase, we measured the transcription of RXRα mRNA in OKT3-treated PBMCs and mimosine-blocked and -released proliferating peripheral blood T cells, using nuclear run-on transcription assay. The results indicate (Fig. 8) that the levels of RXRα mRNA synthesis show only moderate (less than 2-fold) increase during G0/G1 block. Next, we analyzed the effect of actinomycin D and cycloheximide on the loss of RXRα mRNA levels during mimosine release. As shown in Fig.9, Act D had no effect on the kinetics of RXRα mRNA down-regulation during mimosine release. In contrast, when mimosine release was carried out in the presence of CHX, there was a marked inhibition of RXRα mRNA down-regulation. Together, these data suggest that the loss of RXRα mRNA expression during G0/G1 to S transition is partly due to the decrease in the gene transcription but is primarily a result of decreased mRNA stability. In addition, CHX may block the synthesis of post-transcriptional regulatory factor(s) capable of modulating the RXRα mRNA levels during G0/G1 to S transition.Figure 9Effect of Act D and CHX on the RXRα mRNA down-regulation during G1 to S switch. Peripheral blood T cells were treated with mimosine as described. Cells were washed to remove mimosine and maintained in IL2 in presence of Act D or CHX as described. Cells were harvested after the indicated time intervals, and RXRα mRNA was quantitated by RT-PCR. The values represent the mean of three independent experiments with standard error calculated for each value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although there is a growing list of genes that are known to be up-regulated after T cell activation (1Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), there are only a few that are known to be inhibited after activation (36Marth J.D. Lewis D.B. Wilson C.B. Gearn M.E. Krebs E.G.

We have utilized the DD-RT-PCR technique to identify and analyze the genes involved in T cell activation. In this paper, we chose to characterize one such gene and have identified the newly isolated sequence as the unpublished 3′ end of the 5.4-kb human RXRα mRNA. We have shown that the activation of PBMCs resulted in the down-regulation of RXRα mRNA, protein, and DNA binding activity. The extent of RXRα mRNA down-regulation differed between the activating agents; the most effective were those that induced maximum activation. These data demonstrate that down-regulation of RXRα mRNA expression is an event associated with the T cell activation induced by a variety of stimuli, and the level of down-regulation reflects the extent of cellular activation. The finding that the low levels of RXRα are maintained throughout active T cell proliferation as compared with the resting cells is consistent with the possibility of cell cycle regulation of RXRα expression. The activation-induced down-regulation of RXRα mRNA expression was inhibited by agents that blocked the cells in G1 phase, suggesting that the cell cycle block in G1 phase accounted for such inhibition. Because IL2 prevented only the CsA but not the mimosine-induced inhibition of RXRα down-regulation by OKT3, we suspect that the IL2 effect is most likely mediated by the regulation of cell cycle (through the release of the CsA-induced G1 block). Our conclusion that the RXRα mRNA levels are cell cycle regulated is further supported by the studies on the effect of mimosine on actively dividing peripheral T lymphocytes, where large populations of cells were in S phase and RXRα levels were low. Mimosine inhibited proliferation, blocked the cells in the G1 phase, and resulted in significant up-regulation of RXRα mRNA. The release of mimosine-induced G1 block was accompanied by progression into cell cycle and a progressive loss of RXRα mRNA expression. The molecular mechanism of activation-induced down-regulation of RXRα mRNA remains unknown. The data obtained on the role of transcriptional and postranscriptional mechanisms in regulating the levels of RXRα mRNA during T cell activation and G1to S switch show that the down-regulation of RXRα mRNA is primarily the result of a decrease in the mRNA stability and partly the result of a decrease in the gene transcription; new protein synthesis is required to accomplish this. The 3′-untranslated sequence of RXRα mRNA contains a single copy of AUUUA sequence. This sequence has been identified as the mRNA instability signal involved in the mRNA decay (39Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar). Whereas the role of this sequence in the stability of RXRα mRNA remains to be studied, this sequence alone may not account for the RXRα mRNA destabilization during G0/G1 to S switch. Together, our data indicate that the levels of RXRα expression in T lymphocytes are coupled to cell cycle progression, and there is tight regulatory control of RXRα expression during the transition from G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. RXRs along with RARs have the ability to silence transcription in the absence of ligand (40Tsai M.-J. O' Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). It is known that T cell activation induces expression of transcription factor AP-1 (41Makover D. Cuddy M. Yum S. Bradley K. Alpers J. Sukhatme V. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 455-460PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kvanta A. Kontny E. Jondal M. Okret S. Fredholm B.B. Cell. Signalling. 1992; 4: 257-260Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Retinoid receptors regulate transcriptional activation either through receptor-DNA interactions or by inhibiting AP-1 (13Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). It can be speculated that the levels of RXRα in resting T lymphocytes are inhibitory to AP-1 activity and prevent AP-1-induced gene transcription and proliferation. Thus, RXRα may play an important role by providing a switch that allows operation of a signaling system that controls fine tuning of regulation of T cell proliferation. Recent data suggest that RXRs may have a role in the prevention of activation-induced apoptosis in T cell hybridomas and thymocytes (14Iwata M. Mukai M. Nakai Y. Iseki R. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3302-3308PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yang Y. Vacchio M.S. Ashwell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6170-6174Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Yang Y.

It has been shown that activation-induced apoptosis can be prevented by treatment with 9-cis retinoic acid, a ligand that has very high affinity for the RXR receptor (16Yang Y. Mercep M. Ware C.F.

These findings suggest that snRNA-C protein interactions may function to recruit snRNA to, or displace C protein from, splice junctions. In this study, both equilibrium and non-equilibrium RNA binding assays reveal that purified native C protein binds U1, U2, and U6 snRNA with significant affinity (∼7.5–50 nm) although nonspecifically.

Huang M. Soltaninassab S. Rech J.E. Iyengar S. LeStourgeon W.M. Krainer A. The Packaging of Pre-mRNA; Frontiers in Molecular Biology: Eukaryotic mRNA Processing. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 68-102Google Scholar). The tetramer is highly stable in solution and, unlike the A- and B-group proteins, binds RNA in a salt-resistant manner (2Beyer A.L. Christensen M.E. Walker B.W. LeStourgeon W.M. Cell. 1977; 11: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 3Barnett S.F. Friedman D.L. LeStourgeon W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic and ultrastructural studies have shown that three C protein tetramers bind approximately 700 nt of RNA in a cooperative manner and fold the RNA into a unique 19 S triangular complex that can be recovered from intact 40 S monoparticles following their dissociation in low ionic strength buffers (4Huang M.

Biol. 1995; 114: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when all of the core particle proteins are allowed to bind long pre-mRNAs in vitro, a contiguous array of 20-nm 40 S hnRNP particles assemble such that each contains approximately 700 nt of RNA. The same experiment performed with purified native C protein alone yields one triangular complex per 700 nt of RNA. These in vitro activities are consistent with electron micrographs of native hnRNP complexes that mostly reveal contiguous arrays of 20-nm particles. Thus, C protein may function in vivo as a protein ruler that nucleates monoparticle assembly (4Huang M. Rech J.E. Northington S.J. Flicker P.F. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. LeStourgeon W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 518-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Wooley J. Chang S.Y. Wall J. LeStourgeon W.M. Biophys.

Biol. 1988; 8: 2884-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). C protein's intrinsic ability to melt RNA secondary structure further indicates that it may act as an RNA chaperonin to maintain a single-stranded state and to orient the RNA such that trans-acting factors can access their cognate sequences (9Herschlag D.

The in vitro reconstitution studies described above together with C protein's cooperative binding mode suggest that C protein may completely coat elongating transcripts in vivo. In support of this possibility, it has been reported that C protein is present in the nonspecific pre-spliceosomal H complex but that it is displaced from splice junctions during the early events of spliceosome assembly (10Bennett M. Michaud S. Kingston J. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1986-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the ontogeny of mRNA, the site-specific displacement of C protein would be a significant biochemical event. In this context, several recent reports have implicated snRNAs and their associated factors in a mechanism that could modulate C protein's affinity for RNA in a site-specific manner. Although not required for C protein-RNA interactions in vitro, previous studies have indicated that both U1 and U2 snRNPs are required for C protein binding to pre-mRNA (11Mayrand S.H. Pederson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3307-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). More recent reports have suggested that C protein interacts specifically with stem-loop I of U2 snRNA (12Temsamani J. Pederson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24922-24926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and that C protein binds U6 snRNAs that contain elongated uridylate stretches at their 3′ end (13Forne T. Rossi F. Labourier E. Antoine E. Cathala G. Brunel C. Tazi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16476-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the latter studies, it was reported that C protein disrupts U6:U4 snRNA interactions when elongated U6 snRNAs are a part of the complexes. Finally, it has been reported that U6 snRNA plays a role in the modulation of C protein phosphorylation (14Mayrand S.H. Fung P.A. Pederson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and it is now well established that hyperphosphorylated C protein lacks RNA binding activity (15Mayrand S.H. Dwen P. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7764-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Fung P.A. Labrecque R. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the displacement of C protein from branch-point/splice-junction sites might be mediated directly by snRNP binding or by an snRNP-directed C protein phosphorylation event. To explore these possibilities further, we have characterized thein vitro interactions of purified native C protein with U1, U2, and U6 snRNA. C protein contains a consensus RNA recognition motif (CS-RRM) at its amino-terminal end (residues 8–87) (17Keene J.D. Query C.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 41: 179-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Initially, the RRM was believed to be the major determinant of RNA binding. However, we have recently shown that C protein's high affinity RNA binding domain is located between residues 140 and 180 (19McAfee J.G. Shahied-Milam L. Soltaninassab S.R. LeStourgeon W.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 1139-1152PubMed Google Scholar). This 40-residue RNA binding domain is highly basic (28% Arg and Lys) and immediately precedes a 28-residue leucine zipper motif (residues 180–207). Highly basic nucleic acid binding domains preceding leucine zipper motifs have been well characterized in several DNA-binding bZIP transcription factors (i.e. GCN4, Fos, and Jun) (20Busch S.J. Sassone-Corsi P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1549-1556PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pu W.T. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6901-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that this bZIP-like motif (the bZLM) is responsible for C protein's wild type RNA binding activity. Deletion constructs of C protein lacking the CS-RRM, but retaining the bZLM, are able to bind long lengths of RNA with a slightly higher affinity than full-length C protein (19McAfee J.G. Shahied-Milam L. Soltaninassab S.R. LeStourgeon W.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 1139-1152PubMed Google Scholar). This brings into question the function of C protein's CS-RRM. Because the interactions of certain CS-RRMs with snRNA are now well characterized, we were particularly interested in the possibility that C protein may bind cooperatively to long pre-mRNAs through its bZLM and to snRNA through its CS-RRM. Using both equilibrium and non-equilibrium binding assays, we report here that C protein's CS-RRM is not responsible for binding U2 or U6 snRNA. Rather, C protein binds these RNAs in a nonspecific manner through its bZLM motif. We also show that 19 S complex formation can only be slightly attenuated by the presence of U2 snRNA. Finally, we will present evidence for the involvement of C protein's CS-RRM in the tetramer-tetramer interactions associated with formation of 19 S complexes. These studies further the ongoing search for possible functions of CS-RRMs and provide additional evidence for C protein's nonspecific affinity for RNA. Typically, nuclei from approximately 9 billion HeLa S3 cells were isolated as described previously (22Barnett S.F. LeStourgeon W.M. Friedman D.L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 16: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Huang M. LeStourgeon W.M. Celis J.E. The Rapid Preparation of the hnRNP Core Proteins and Stepwise Assembly of hnRNP Particles in Vitro: Handbook of Cell Biology. I. Academic Press, New York1994Google Scholar). The nuclei were sonicated briefly on ice and exposed to mild digestion with micrococcal nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim, 150 units/ml sonicate) for 5 min at 37 °C. Particulate material was removed by centrifugation (5856 × g for 10 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor). Pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin were added to the supernatant prior to loading on a Hi Trap Q column (anion-exchange; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a 200–460 mm NaCl gradient. Fractions containing C protein were combined, diluted 3-fold, and further purified using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Mono Q HR 5/5 column. Purified C protein was then equilibrated in 1× STE via dialysis for 12 h at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). The 709-nt transcript of the human β-globin gene was prepared by enzyme digestion (BamHI) of the pHBG709 vector, followed by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase as described previously (8Conway G. Wooley J. Bibring T. LeStourgeon W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2884-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This particular RNA possesses the coding sequence for exon 1, intron 1, and a portion of exon 2 of human β-globin. The pHU6–1 (DraI), pMRG3U2 (BamHI), and the pHU1A (SalI) vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Thoru Pederson. U2 and U6 snRNAs were transcribed using a T7-MEGA shortscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Inc.) in order to produce high yields of RNA. U1 snRNA, transcribed with S6 polymerase under previously described conditions, was used as a control substrate (8Conway G. Wooley J. Bibring T. LeStourgeon W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2884-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As an additional control, a 116-nt RNA was transcribed from a portion of antisense 18 S ribosomal DNA. In each case where RNA was radiolabeled, [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci) was added to the transcription reaction. The r(U)14, the SELEX-identified winner sequence, and the 20-nt β-globin sequence were commercially prepared by Cruachem. The sequence of the winner oligonucleotide has been previously described by Gorlach et al. (38Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23074-23078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-globin 20-mer is a sequence from IVS1 of human β-globin pre-mRNA that is not thought to function in pre-mRNA processing (see Burd and Dreyfuss (18Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar) for the nucleotide sequence). All three oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci). RNA concentrations were determined through A260measurements. The extinction coefficients of U1, U2, and U6 snRNA are similar due to their similar uridine percentages (i.e. 24%, 29%, and 27%, respectively). Observed differences in C protein's affinity for these substrates is thus not due to differences in substrate concentrations. Although differences in the extinction coefficient between the 20-nt β-globin transcript and the r(U)14 substrate could lead to lower molar concentrations of the homoribopolymer this alone can not explain the absence of observed binding to these RNAs especially inasmuch as, in separate experiments, they were used at a 10-fold higher concentration than the snRNA substrates. Optical density measurements at 280 nm were also obtained to ensure the absence of protein contamination in the RNA substrates. RNA-protein interactions were examined using gel mobility shift assays. Each 20-μl reaction consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, C protein (or a deletion construct of C protein), and 100 pm amounts of the appropriate 32P-labeled RNA. Increasing concentrations of protein were used in each sample. Each sample was allowed to incubate for 20 min at room temperature. A 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide to bisacrylamide ratio of 30:1) was pre-electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE for 30 min (Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis system). The samples were first loaded into the gel while it was running at 100 V and then electrophoresed for 30 min at 200 V. Radioactive bands were detected with the use of a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. In Figs. 1, 2, and 6, the apparent mobility retardation of the free RNA probes seen in both panels is a result of loading consecutive lanes while the gel was running and does not represent protein-RNA interactions. Control experiments using Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) and EBNA-1 DNA (provided with the bandshift kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed to confirm that binding occurs under the conditions described above. As a negative control, U2 and U6 snRNA was titrated with bovine serum albumin. Bovine serum albumin was not observed to bind either substrate under these conditions, even at high bovine serum albumin concentrations.Figure 2Gel mobility shift analysis of C protein binding to U1 snRNA and a 116-nt RNA. These RNAs were used as competitors to determine whether the binding of C protein to U2 and U6 snRNA was sequence-specific. C protein concentration ranged from 0 to 50 nm. A, identified are the migrations of free U1 snRNA and the C protein-U1 snRNA complex. The Kdvalue is estimated to be 10 nm. B, the findings here show that C protein will also bind to the 116-nt RNA; however, the approximated Kd value is slightly higher than that of the C protein-U1snRNA interaction (25 nm). As in Fig. 1, the apparent mobility retardation of the free RNA probe (especially apparent in the second and third lanes ofpanel A) is due to loading consecutive lanes while the gel was running and does not represent protein-RNA interactions. The position of the protein-RNA complex is indicated in both panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Gel mobility shift analysis of the interactions between the M1-F115 and Y119-G290 constructs and U6 snRNA. A, increasing concentrations of M1-F115 (0–11 × 102 nm) were incubated with U6 snRNA. The Kd of this interaction is estimated to be 125 nm. The migration of the free probe and the slowed migration of the complex formed are as indicated. B, increasing concentrations of Y119-G290 (0–100 nm) were incubated with U6 snRNA. Indicated on the gel are free U6 snRNA and the Y119-G290/U6snRNA complex (Kd ≈ 10 nm). The apparent mobility retardation of the free RNA probes seen in panel B (lanes 2 and 3) is a result of loading consecutive lanes while the gel was running and does not represent protein-RNA interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the case of the band shift assay, dissociation constants were determined by visually identifying the electrophoretic lane representing the protein concentration at which half of the RNA present is bound (24Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 25Revzin A. Karam J.D. Chao L. Warr G.W. Gel Retardation Assays for Nucleic Acid-Binding Proteins: Methods in Nucleic Acids Research. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 205-226Google Scholar). The Kd values listed in Table Iare therefore approximate. This qualitative method has been shown to be valid for Kd estimations providing the nucleic acid concentration is at least 10-fold lower than the protein concentration at the midpoint (24Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In this context, Kd estimates from the band shift assay were confirmed through the equilibrium binding study described below. The band shift assay was also used to identify the primary snRNA binding domain. In these studies the approximate Kd values determined for the M1-F115 construct (the RRM) and the Y119-G290 construct (the bZLM) were sufficiently dissimilar so as to render the results unambiguous.Table IApproximate Kd values (nm)M1-F115Y119-G290C proteinU2 snRNA125107.5U6 snRNA12510>50U1 snRNA627.510116 nt751025 Open table in a new tab Equilibrium binding isotherms were obtained by measuring the change in the fluorescence signal (enhancement) that occurs when C protein binds the fluorescent probe RNA, poly-r(εA). The probe substrate was approximately 3000 nt. Fluorescence measurements were performed with an SLM Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer. Excitation and emission slits were fixed at 4 and 8 nm, respectively. Titrations were conducted by exciting a fixed amount (0.5–2 μm) of the probe RNA at 310 nm, and measuring the change in its emission at 410 nm, as a function of increasing protein concentration. The fluorescent probe RNA was prepared as described previously (26Steiner R.F. Kinner W. Lunasin A. Delac J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 294: 24-37Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The concentration of the probe RNA was determined using an extinction coefficient (ε) of 5330 for optical density measurements at 260 nm (24Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were corrected for dilution due to the addition of protein sample, and for background fluorescence. In all cases, the dilution of probe RNA did not exceed 5% of the total sample volume. Inner filter corrections were not necessary as the quantities of RNA used in these titrations have negligible absorbance at 310 nm. To determine if native C protein binds the fluorescent probe through a single binding mode, the macromolecular binding density function analysis (27Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4629-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed at RNA concentrations of 0.7, 1.4, and 2.8 μm (28Soltaninassab S. Molecular Biology. Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN1996Google Scholar). The competitor RNAs were used in 2-fold molar excess (total nucleotides) depending on the strength of the competitor as a substrate for C protein binding (determined through test titrations). An expression for the apparent equilibrium constant (Kapp) for the interaction of C protein with each competitor RNA was derived considering the following equilibria (29Amrute S.B. Abdul-Manan Z. Pandey V. Williams K.R. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8282-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 30Abdul-Manan N. O'Malley S.M. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3545-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). P+ɛA→PɛA REACTION1 P+comp→[Pcomp] REACTION2P, εA, and comp are the steady state concentrations of protein, poly[r(εA)], and competitor RNA, respectively. PεA and Pcomp are the equilibrium concentrations of protein-(εA) or competitor RNA complex. The mass action expression defining theKapp for the interaction of protein with poly[r(εA)] (KεA) or competitor RNA (Kcomp) are shown in Equations 1 and 2. KɛA=PɛA[P]free[ɛA]freeEquation 1 Kcomp=Pcomp[P]free[comp]freeEquation 2 In a competition titration, the free protein concentration for both mass action expressions is the same. As a result, both expressions can be equated through [P]free. The solution forKcomp is shown in the following equation. Kcomp=Pcomp×KɛA×[ɛA]free[PɛA][comp]freeEquation 3 In the above equation, KεA was derived from a fit of data from a control titration (no competitor present) using the McGhee von-Hippel non-cooperative binding equation (31McGhee J.D. von Hipple P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2697) Google Scholar). Velocity sedimentation centrifugation in 15–30% linear glycerol gradients was used to characterize the sedimentation properties of various protein-RNA complexes and the efficiency of 19 S complex assembly in the presence of competitor RNAs. The gradients were subjected to centrifugation at 134,400 × g for 24 h at 4 °C in the Beckman SW 28 rotor. The protein and RNA present in consecutive fractions was precipitated with three volumes of cold ethanol and resolved by SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The gels were first stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to identify the fractions containing the protein peak. Following this, the gels were dried (1 h at 80 °C) and exposed to phosphor screens to visualize radiolabeled RNA. Radioactive bands were detected with the use of a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The efficiency of 19 S complex formation was calculated by densitometry using NIH Image. The area under each peak (or for each band) was determined and the values (which were directly proportional to the band's density) were summed to determine the total integrated area. The integrated area for the 19 S bands alone was also determined and divided by the total in order to calculate percent 19 S complex formed. The M1-F115 and the Y119-G290 constructs were generated as described previously (19McAfee J.G. Shahied-Milam L. Soltaninassab S.R. LeStourgeon W.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 1139-1152PubMed Google Scholar). The His-tagged 8KTD/A and 13SMNS/A constructs were generated by run-around polymerase chain reaction using the pET-28a vector, containing the full-length C1 cDNA sequence, as the template. In each case, primers were created such that the codons that were to be mutated were replaced with alanine (GCG). After kinasing and religating, the vector was then purified by gel extraction (Qiagen, Inc.). The purified plasmid was then transformed into both DH5α and BL21 DE3 pLys S Escherichia coli strains. Expression and purification of these C protein constructs was performed as described previously (19McAfee J.G. Shahied-Milam L. Soltaninassab S.R. LeStourgeon W.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 1139-1152PubMed Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed to determine if interactions between purified C protein and U1, U2, and U6 snRNA are of sufficient affinity to monitor under nonequilibrium conditions. Although the focus of this study was designed to evaluate interactions between C protein and U2 and U6 snRNA, U1 snRNA and a 116-nt transcript of ribosomal DNA were used to further examine the question of sequence-specific binding. In vitro transcribed 32P-labeled snRNAs were incubated with increasing concentrations of purified native C protein (1.0–50 nm), and the preparations were resolved in 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. As shown in Fig.1 A, C protein binds U2 snRNA with an approximate Kd of 7.5 nm. C protein also binds U6 snRNA but with lower affinity (Fig.1 B). In the latter titrations, the protein concentration yielding 50% RNA bound complexes (Kd) could not be determined due to practical limitations associated with the methodology for obtaining highly purified native C protein. It is apparent, however, that the Kd for the interaction of native C protein with U6 snRNA is not significantly above 50 nm. In Fig. 2 (A and B), it can be seen that C protein binds U1 snRNA with aKd near 10 nm. It can also be seen that C proteins binds with slightly lower affinity to a 116-nt transcript of ribosomal RNA (about 25 nm) (see TableI for summary). To determine if these differences in relative affinity occur in solution under equilibrium conditions, binding to the three snRNAs and to the 116-nt control was monitored using fluorescence spectroscopy (27Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4629-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kowalczykowski S.C. Longberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 34Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Longberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 35Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7799-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this assay, the ability of the individual snRNAs to compete as substrates with fluorescently labeled poly(A) was determined. RNA preparations containing a 2:1 μm excess (total nucleotides) of snRNA over the fluorescent probe RNA were titrated with increasing amounts of C protein (from 0.5–16.5 nm). In these experiments, C protein binding to competitor RNA is seen as an attenuation of the binding-induced enhancement of fluorescence from the probe RNA. Consistent with the order of affinity observed in the band shift assay, calculations from the data shown in Fig. 3 reveal that C protein binds U2 snRNA under equilibrium conditions with 2-fold higher affinity than U1 snRNA, a 10-fold higher affinity that U6 snRNA, and a 4-fold higher affinity than to the 116-nt control substrate. Additionally, C protein binds the 116-nt control substrate with a 2-fold higher affinity than U6 snRNA. Although the equilibrium binding assay used here can detect subtle differences in relative binding affinities, it does not yield absolute dissociation constants because the competitors are present in molar excess to the probe and because the poly(εA) probe is of sufficient length (3000 nt) to accommodate C protein's cooperative binding mode (36McAfee J.G. Soltaninassab S.R. Lindsay M.E. LeStourgeon W.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results from both assays were not unexpected, as our previous findings"
