https://openalex.org/W2750910159,"Two parallel signalling pathways, driven by Nodal and BMP, respectively integrate left- and right-handed information that drives heart looping and morphogenesis, and are conserved between zebrafish, chicken and mouse. The establishment of left–right asymmetries in vertebrate embryos is thought to depend on a signalling pathway mediated by Nodal–Pitx2 that induces left-side properties. Evidence indicated that right-side properties are specified as a default state, with the Nodal-driven pathway being repressed on the right-hand side by the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) factor Snail. Angela Nieto and colleagues analysed fish, chicken and mice and found that the normal asymmetric development of their hearts requires the activity of another signalling pathway. This BMP-driven pathway promotes the expression of EMT factors on the right-hand side of the lateral plate mesoderm, which induces cell movements that are necessary for the dextral looping of the heart. The authors conclude that left–right asymmetries in vertebrates are set up by Nodal- and BMP-driven pathways that are mutually repressed on the opposite side of the developing embryos. Most animals show external bilateral symmetry, which hinders the observation of multiple internal left–right (L/R) asymmetries that are fundamental to organ packaging and function1,2. In vertebrates, left identity is mediated by the left-specific Nodal–Pitx2 axis that is repressed on the right-hand side by the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer Snail1 (refs 3, 4). Despite some existing evidence3,5, it remains unclear whether an equivalent instructive pathway provides right-hand-specific information to the embryo. Here we show that, in zebrafish, BMP mediates the L/R asymmetric activation of another EMT inducer, Prrx1a, in the lateral plate mesoderm with higher levels on the right. Prrx1a drives L/R differential cell movements towards the midline, leading to a leftward displacement of the cardiac posterior pole through an actomyosin-dependent mechanism. Downregulation of Prrx1a prevents heart looping and leads to mesocardia. Two parallel and mutually repressed pathways, respectively driven by Nodal and BMP on the left and right lateral plate mesoderm, converge on the asymmetric activation of the transcription factors Pitx2 and Prrx1, which integrate left and right information to govern heart morphogenesis. This mechanism is conserved in the chicken embryo, and in the mouse SNAIL1 acts in a similar manner to Prrx1a in zebrafish and PRRX1 in the chick. Thus, a differential L/R EMT produces asymmetric cell movements and forces, more prominent from the right, that drive heart laterality in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2752673412,"The most intense auroral emissions from Earth's polar regions, called discrete for their sharply defined spatial configurations, are generated by a process involving coherent acceleration of electrons by slowly evolving, powerful electric fields directed along the magnetic field lines that connect Earth's space environment to its polar regions. In contrast, Earth's less intense auroras are generally caused by wave scattering of magnetically trapped populations of hot electrons (in the case of diffuse aurora) or by the turbulent or stochastic downward acceleration of electrons along magnetic field lines by waves during transitory periods (in the case of broadband or Alfvénic aurora). Jupiter's relatively steady main aurora has a power density that is so much larger than Earth's that it has been taken for granted that it must be generated primarily by the discrete auroral process. However, preliminary in situ measurements of Jupiter's auroral regions yielded no evidence of such a process. Here we report observations of distinct, high-energy, downward, discrete electron acceleration in Jupiter's auroral polar regions. We also infer upward magnetic-field-aligned electric potentials of up to 400 kiloelectronvolts, an order of magnitude larger than the largest potentials observed at Earth. Despite the magnitude of these upward electric potentials and the expectations from observations at Earth, the downward energy flux from discrete acceleration is less at Jupiter than that caused by broadband or stochastic processes, with broadband and stochastic characteristics that are substantially different from those at Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2753801662,"Head motion can be estimated at any point of fMRI image processing. Processing steps involving temporal interpolation (e.g., slice time correction or outlier replacement) often precede motion estimation in the literature. From first principles it can be anticipated that temporal interpolation will alter head motion in a scan. Here we demonstrate this effect and its consequences in five large fMRI datasets. Estimated head motion was reduced by 10–50% or more following temporal interpolation, and reductions were often visible to the naked eye. Such reductions make the data seem to be of improved quality. Such reductions also degrade the sensitivity of analyses aimed at detecting motion-related artifact and can cause a dataset with artifact to falsely appear artifact-free. These reduced motion estimates will be particularly problematic for studies needing estimates of motion in time, such as studies of dynamics. Based on these findings, it is sensible to obtain motion estimates prior to any image processing (regardless of subsequent processing steps and the actual timing of motion correction procedures, which need not be changed). We also find that outlier replacement procedures change signals almost entirely during times of motion and therefore have notable similarities to motion-targeting censoring strategies (which withhold or replace signals entirely during times of motion)."
https://openalex.org/W2751059225,"Recent studies have shown that patients with manifest non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), e.g. steatosis grade 3 or steatohepatitis with or without beginning fibrosis frequently show altered fecal microbiota composition and elevated bacterial endotoxin levels. However, if these alterations are signs of a progressing disease or are already found in initial disease stages has not yet been clarified.Twenty children with simple steatosis (grade 1) diagnosed by ultrasound and 29 normal weight healthy control children (age <10 years) were included in the study (mean age 7.6 ± 1.1 years). Metabolic parameters, markers of intestinal barrier function and inflammation were determined.Activity of alanine aminotransferase, concentrations of some markers of inflammation and insulin resistance were significantly higher in plasma of NAFLD children than in controls. When compared to controls, plasma bacterial endotoxin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) levels were significantly higher in NAFLD children (+50% and +24%, respectively), while soluble CD14 serum and D-lactate plasma levels as well as the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth did not differ between groups. Plasma endotoxin and LBP levels were positive associated with proinflammatory markers like plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, c-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and leptin while no associations with markers of insulin resistance were found.Taken together, our results indicate that even in juvenile patients with early stages of NAFLD e.g. simple steatosis grade 1, plasma endotoxin concentrations are already elevated further suggesting that intestinal barrier dysfunction might be present already in the initial phases of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2752215552,"A new methodology is proposed to couple a meteorological model with a building energy use model. The aim of such a coupling is to improve the boundary conditions of both models with no significant increase in computational time. In the present case, the Canopy Interface Model (CIM) is coupled with CitySim. CitySim provides the geometrical characteristics to CIM, which then calculates a high resolution profile of the meteorological variables. These are in turn used by CitySim to calculate the energy flows in an urban district. We have conducted a series of experiments on the EPFL campus in Lausanne, Switzerland, to show the effectiveness of the coupling strategy. First, measured data from the campus for the year 2015 are used to force CIM and to evaluate its aptitude to reproduce high resolution vertical profiles. Second, we compare the use of local climatic data and data from a meteorological station located outside the urban area, in an evaluation of energy use. In both experiments, we demonstrate the importance of using in building energy software, meteorological variables that account for the urban microclimate. Furthermore, we also show that some building and urban forms are more sensitive to the local environment."
https://openalex.org/W2750650813,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) have been highly successful in the treatment of cancer. While PD-1 expression has been widely investigated, its role in CD4+ effector T cells in the setting of health and cancer remains unclear, particularly in the setting of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive and common form of brain cancer. We examined the functional and molecular features of PD-1+CD4+CD25-CD127+Foxp3-effector cells in healthy subjects and in patients with GBM. In healthy subjects, we found that PD-1+CD4+ effector cells are dysfunctional: they do not proliferate but can secrete large quantities of IFNγ. Strikingly, blocking antibodies against PD-1 did not rescue proliferation. RNA-sequencing revealed features of exhaustion in PD-1+ CD4 effectors. In the context of GBM, tumors were enriched in PD-1+ CD4+ effectors that were similarly dysfunctional and unable to proliferate. Furthermore, we found enrichment of PD-1+TIM-3+ CD4+ effectors in tumors, suggesting that co-blockade of PD-1 and TIM-3 in GBM may be therapeutically beneficial. RNA-sequencing of blood and tumors from GBM patients revealed distinct differences between CD4+ effectors from both compartments with enrichment in multiple gene sets from tumor infiltrating PD-1-CD4+ effectors cells. Enrichment of these gene sets in tumor suggests a more metabolically active cell state with signaling through other co-receptors. PD-1 expression on CD4 cells identifies a dysfunctional subset refractory to rescue with PD-1 blocking antibodies, suggesting that the influence of immune checkpoint inhibitors may involve recovery of function in the PD-1-CD4+ T cell compartment. Additionally, co-blockade of PD-1 and TIM-3 in GBM may be therapeutically beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W2753059032,"ABO blood type is an inherited characteristic. The associations between ABO blood type and risk of all cancer and specific cancers were examined in a prospective cohort study of 18,244 Chinese men enrolled in 1986. During the 25 years of follow-up, 3,973 men developed cancer including 964 lung cancers, 624 colorectal cancers, 560 gastric cancers, 353 liver cancers, and 172 urinary bladder cancers. Hazard ratios (HR) for all cancer and specific cancers by ABO blood type were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Compared with blood type A, blood type B was associated with statistically significant reduced risk of all cancers (HR, 0.91, 95% CI:0.84, 0.99). Both blood types B and AB were associated with significantly lower risk of gastrointestinal cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively. Blood type B was also associated with significantly lower risk of stomach cancer and bladder cancer, while blood type AB was associated with significantly increased risk of liver cancer. By histological type, blood types B and AB were associated with lower risk of epidermoid carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, but were not associated with risk of sarcoma, lymphoma, leukemia or other cell types of cancer. The findings of this study support a role of genetic traits related to ABO blood type in the development of cancers in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts."
https://openalex.org/W2751210951,"We quantified trends in the 1985 to 2015 summer bottom-water temperature on the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) continental shelf for data collected at 88 stations with depths ranging from 3 to 63 m. The analysis was supplemented with monthly data collected from 1963 to 1965 in the same area. The seasonal summer peak in average bottom-water temperature varied concurrently with air temperature, but with a 2- to 5-month lag. The summer bottom-water temperature declined gradually with depth from 30 oC at stations closest to the shore, to 20 oC at the offshore edge of the study area, and increased an average 0.051 oC y-1 between1963 and 2015. The bottom-water warming in summer for all stations was 1.9 times faster compared to the rise in local summer air temperatures, and 6.4 times faster than the concurrent increase in annual global ocean sea surface temperatures. The annual rise in average summer bottom-water temperatures on the subtropical nGOM continental shelf is comparable to the few published temperature trend estimates from colder environments. These recent changes in the heat storage on the nGOM continental shelf will affect oxygen and carbon cycling, spatial distribution of fish and shrimp, and overall species diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2751068916,"Background Currently, there are many studies focusing on the influencing factors of the elderly people’s living arrangements or health status, but little is known about the relationship between living arrangements or health status and long-term care models for the old-age, especially the joint effects. Objective We aimed to assess the effects of health status and living arrangements on long-term care models (LTCM) among the elderly of Xiamen, China, especially their cumulative joint effects. Methods A total of 14,373 participants aged ≥ 60 years by multistage sampling in Xiamen of China were enrolled. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the Odds ratios (ORs) regressing LTCM on health status and living arrangements using the Anderson model as theoretical framework. Results Totally, 14,292 valid questionnaires were obtained, of which 86.37% selected home care. With the increase of disability degree, older people are more likely to choose institutional care, compared to living alone (ORs = 1.75, 2.06, 4.00, 4.01 for the “relatively independent’, “mild disability’, “moderate disability’, and “total disability’, respectively, in comparison with “completely independent’). The elderly living with children and other family members preferred to choose home care. (ORs = 0.50, 0.39, 0.40, and 0.43 for the “living with children’, “living with spouse’, “living with children and spouse’, and “living with others’, respectively, in comparison with “alone’). Additionally, residence, number of children, education level, and feelings of loneliness were the determinants of the choice of social pension. Conclusion A multitude of older people are trended to choose home care in Xiamen of China. There was an interaction and joint effect between the degree of disability and the living arrangements on LTCM. Therefore, policymakers should pay close attention to care for those living alone, childless, and disabled elders to meet their care needs, especially in home care. In addition, the social construction of facilities for elders in rural areas should be strengthened."

https://openalex.org/W2751346100,"Necroptosis is an immunogenic cell death program that is associated with a host of human diseases, including inflammation, infections, and cancer. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and its substrate mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) are required for necroptosis activation. Specifically, RIPK3-dependent MLKL phosphorylation promotes the assembly of disulfide bond-dependent MLKL polymers that drive the execution of necroptosis. However, how MLKL disulfide bond formation is regulated is not clear. In this study we discovered that the MLKL-modifying compound necrosulfonamide cross-links cysteine 86 of human MLKL to cysteine 32 of the thiol oxidoreductase thioredoxin-1 (Trx1). Recombinant Trx1 preferentially binds to monomeric MLKL and blocks MLKL disulfide bond formation and polymerization in vitro. Inhibition of MLKL polymer formation requires the reducing activity of Trx1. Importantly, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Trx1 promotes MLKL polymerization and sensitizes cells to necroptosis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Trx1 with compound PX-12 induces necroptosis in multiple cancer cell lines. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that Trx1 is a critical regulator of necroptosis that suppresses cell death by maintaining MLKL in a reduced inactive state. Our results further suggest new directions for targeted cancer therapy in which thioredoxin inhibitors like PX-12 could potentially be used to specifically target cancers expressing high levels of MLKL or MLKL short isoforms.

Overactive necroptosis is thought to occur as a result of changes in gene expression that elevate RIPK1/3 and MLKL protein levels, although the mechanism by which these changes occur is undefined. Consequently, cells become sensitized to necroptotic stimuli causing undesired cell death and irreversible tissue damage. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate necroptosis will help advance current efforts in developing therapeutic strategies for modulating necroptosis in vivo, a challenge that has persisted in the field thus far. receptor-interacting protein receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone reactive oxygen species necrosulfonamide N-terminal domain thioredoxin-1 immunoprecipitation apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis doxycycline amino acids Tet repressor dimerization domain lactate dehydrogenase.

MLKL then forms oligomers that somehow disrupt the integrity of the plasma membrane through a process that is not fully understood.

Biol. 2017; 37: e00497-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently we demonstrated that MLKL forms disulfide bond-dependent amyloid-like fibers to promote necroptosis. MLKL mutant with multiple cysteine residues changed to serine residues could not form intermolecular disulfide bonds and is greatly compromised in its ability to induce necroptosis (36Liu S. Liu H. Johnston A. Hanna-Addams S. Reynoso E. Xiang Y. Wang Z. MLKL forms disulfide bond-dependent amyloid-like polymers to induce necroptosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114: E7450-E7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results suggest that MLKL activity is tightly regulated by its redox state. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production are observed during necroptosis (37Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Inhibition of caspases increases the sensitivity of L929 cells to necrosis mediated by tumor necrosis factor.J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). In murine cells, TNF-α-induced necroptosis can be prevented by co-treating cells with ROS-scavenging molecules such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (38Shindo R. Kakehashi H. Okumura K. Kumagai Y. Nakano H. Critical contribution of oxidative stress to TNFα-induced necroptosis downstream of RIPK1 activation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 436: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that mitochondrial ROS induced RIPK1 autophosphorylation, bolstering the idea that oxidation plays an important role in the mammalian necroptotic pathway (39Zhang Y. Su S.S. Zhao S. Yang Z. Zhong C.Q. Chen X. Cai Q. Yang Z.H. Huang D. Wu R. Han J. RIP1 autophosphorylation is promoted by mitochondrial ROS and is essential for RIP3 recruitment into necrosome.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, whether similar oxidative events drive MLKL activation in human cells remains a topic of much debate. Here, we provide evidence that thioredoxin-1 (Trx1), a 12-kDa thiol oxidoreductase, suppresses necroptosis by blocking MLKL disulfide bond formation and polymerization. Trx1 functions as an anti-oxidizing enzyme that is central for regulating cellular redox balance. Trx1 protects cells from oxidative stress by catalyzing thiol disulfide exchange reactions that results in the reduction of disulfide bonds on specific protein targets, thereby modulating their activities (41Sies H. Berndt C. Jones D.P. Oxidative stress.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar, 42Lu J. Holmgren A. Thioredoxin system in cell death progression.Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2012; 17: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Proteins regulated by Trx1 include cell surface receptors, kinases, transcription factors, and other signaling molecules that are involved in a multitude of biological processes including cell death (42Lu J. Holmgren A. Thioredoxin system in cell death progression.Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2012; 17: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 43Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K.

Thioredoxin promotes ASK1 ubiquitination and degradation to inhibit ASK1-mediated apoptosis in a redox activity-independent manner.Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In this study we found that necrosulfonamide (NSA), a small molecule inhibitor of MLKL (23Sun L. Wang H. Wang Z. He S. Chen S. Liao D. Wang L. Yan J. Liu W. Lei X. Wang X. Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein mediates necrosis signaling downstream of RIP3 kinase.Cell. 2012; 148: 213-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar), cross-linked Cys-32 of Trx1 to Cys-86 of human MLKL. In vitro interaction studies revealed that Trx1 interacted with MLKL and maintained MLKL in a reduced state. Knockdown of Trx1 by shRNA enhanced MLKL tetramer and polymer formation. Moreover, Trx1 knockdown cells were more sensitive to necroptosis upon induction of RIPK3 and MLKL protein expression. These results were further corroborated with the use of a commercially available Trx1 inhibitor, PX-12, which disables the recycling of Trx1 by thioredoxin reductase. PX-12 treatment promoted RIPK1–RIPK3–MLKL necrosome formation, RIPK3-dependent MLKL phosphorylation, MLKL polymerization, and ultimately caspase-independent necrotic cell death. Overall, these findings point to Trx1 as a suppressor of necroptosis that functions at the step of MLKL polymer formation. NSA is a synthetic compound that inhibits necroptosis in human cells (23Sun L. Wang H. Wang Z. He S. Chen S. Liao D. Wang L. Yan J. Liu W. Lei X. Wang X. Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein mediates necrosis signaling downstream of RIP3 kinase.Cell. 2012; 148: 213-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). NSA contains two potential Michael acceptors that covalently conjugate cysteine residues on target proteins. Mutation of either Michael acceptor renders NSA non-functional (23Sun L. Wang H. Wang Z. He S. Chen S. Liao D. Wang L. Yan J. Liu W. Lei X. Wang X.

By irreversibly conjugating Cys-86 of human MLKL protein, NSA prevents necroptosis without affecting RIPK1–RIPK3–MLKL necrosome complex formation or RIPK3-dependent MLKL phosphorylation (23Sun L.

MLKL forms disulfide bond-dependent amyloid-like polymers to induce necroptosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114: E7450-E7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We observed that NSA cross-linked MLKL to an endogenous protein in NTD-DmrB-FLAG cells, which stably express a truncated MLKL transgene containing the N-terminal domain (NTD) fused to an interaction-inducible DmrB domain under the control of a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible promoter (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis revealed that NSA, but not NSA-D1, produced a prominent extra protein band that migrated near 55 kDa (lanes 2 and 3, Fig. 1B), which is ∼12–15 kDa larger than NTD-DmrB itself. This indicated that NSA requires two cysteine-reactive Michael acceptor moieties, one of which is lacking in NSA-D1 to successfully cross-link MLKL to a 12–15-kDa endogenous protein. As expected, NSA cross-linking required Cys-86 of MLKL, which is a known targeting site for NSA (lane 4, Fig. 1C). Next, we set out to determine the identity of the protein cross-linked to NTD-DmrB by NSA. NTD-DmrB-NSA–protein complexes were isolated from whole cell extracts by FLAG-tag affinity purification and subjected to SDS-PAGE for silver-staining (Fig. 1D). The 55-kDa gel band of interest was excised and subjected to LC/MS analysis to determine the protein composition. The list of candidate proteins was narrowed down to those with a molecular weight between 12 and 15 kDa. One of the proteins that fit this criterion was thioredoxin-1 (Trx1). Trx1 is a small cytoplasmic oxidoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of disulfide bonds on specific protein substrates. To verify that Trx1 was cross-linked to MLKL by NSA, we ectopically expressed either wild-type or a C86S mutant HA-FLAG-MLKL full-length protein in HEK293T cells and treated these cells with NSA for 16 h. Anti-Trx1 Western blotting of the FLAG-IP product confirmed that Trx1 was cross-linked by NSA to wild-type MLKL (lane 2) but not to C86S mutant (lane 4) (Fig. 1E). MLKL-NSA-Trx1 cross-linking was also confirmed through ectopic expression of HA-tagged Trx1 in HeLa:GFP-RIPK3:MLKL cells, which stably express GFP-RIPK3 and MLKL-HA-FLAG under the control of a Dox-inducible promoter (Fig. 1F). In HA-Trx1-expressing cells, NSA cross-linked MLKL to both endogenous Trx1 and HA-Trx1, producing two cross-linking products (lane 4, Fig. 1F). The ability of Trx1 to reduce disulfide bonds is attributed to two reactive cysteine residues, Cys-32 and Cys-35, located within its active site (40Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Physiological functions of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar, 41Sies H. Berndt C. Jones D.P. Oxidative stress.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). To determine which cysteine of Trx1 reacts with NSA, we mutated Cys-32 and Cys-35 to serine residues individually or in combination and tested MLKL cross-linking. FLAG-IP revealed that C32S, but not C35S, failed to conjugate MLKL, indicating that Cys-32 is necessary for NSA cross-linking (lane 4, Fig. 1G). This suggests that the catalytic domain of Trx1 mediates the interaction with MLKL. Given that NSA cross-links Trx1 to MLKL under normal conditions, we tested whether Trx1 could directly bind to MLKL in cells. However, attempts to verify their interaction by standard MLKL or Trx1 immunoprecipitation assays were not successful. To overcome this challenge, we first immobilized recombinant HA-Trx1-His6 purified from BL21 bacteria cells to nickel-agarose beads and incubated them with cell extracts prepared from HeLa:GFP-RIPK3:MLKL cells. Nickel beads containing wild-type Trx1 were able to pull down MLKL (lane 2, Fig. 2A), which was not the case with the beads containing the CS2 (C32S/C35S) mutant (lane 3, Fig. 2A). Next, immobilized Trx1 nickel beads were incubated with either control or T/S/Z-induced necroptotic cell extracts prepared from HT-29 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Both wild-type Trx1 and the C35S mutant bound MLKL (lanes 3–6, Fig. 2C). Interestingly, C35S mutant showed even higher affinity with MLKL than wild-type (compare lanes 5 and 3), similar to a previous report that C35S mutant constitutively interacted with its known substrate apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) with higher affinity (44Liu Y. Min W. Thioredoxin promotes ASK1 ubiquitination and degradation to inhibit ASK1-mediated apoptosis in a redox activity-independent manner.Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Importantly, Trx1-binding affinity with MLKL was significantly higher in control extracts than extracts prepared from T/S/Z-treated cells (lanes 3 and 4 and lane 5 and 6, Fig. 2C), suggesting that Trx1 preferentially associates with monomeric MLKL molecules under normal condition. Trx1 reduces disulfide bonds on specific target proteins, thereby maintaining the reducing environment of the cytoplasm, preventing undesired protein aggregation and regulating redox signaling pathways (40Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Physiological functions of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar, 41Sies H. Berndt C. Jones D.P.

https://openalex.org/W2753933744,"Background Daodi-herb is a part of Chinese culture, which has been naturally selected by traditional Chinese medicine clinical practice for many years. Sweet wormwood herb is a kind of Daodi-herb, and comes from Artemisia annua L. Artemisinin is a kind of effective antimalarial drug being extracted from A. annua. Because of artemisinin, Sweet wormwood herb earns a reputation. Based on the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (PPRC), Sweet wormwood herb can be used to resolve summerheat-heat, and prevent malaria. Besides, it also has other medical efficacies. A. annua, a medicinal plant that is widely distributed in the world contains many kinds of chemical composition. Research has shown that compatibility of artemisinin, scopoletin, arteannuin B and arteannuic acid has antimalarial effect. Compatibility of scopoletin, arteannuin B and arteannuic acid is conducive to resolving summerheat-heat. Chemical constituents in A. annua vary significantly according to geographical locations. So, distribution of A. annua may play a key role in the characteristics of efficacy and chemical constituents of Sweet wormwood herb. It is of great significance to study this relationship. Objectives We mainly analyzed the relationship between the chemical constituents (arteannuin B, artemisinin, artemisinic acid, and scopoletin) with special efficacy in A. annua that come from different provinces in china, and analyzed the relationship between chemical constituents and spatial distribution, in order to find out the relationship between efficacy, chemical constituents and distribution. Methods A field survey was carried out to collect A. annua plant samples. A global positioning system (GPS) was used for obtaining geographical coordinates of sampling sites. Chemical constituents in A. annua were determined by liquid chromatography tandem an atmospheric pressure ionization-electrospray mass spectrometry. Relationship between chemical constituents including proportions, correlation analysis (CoA), principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (ClA) was displayed through Excel and R software version2.3.2(R), while the one between efficacy, chemical constituents and spatial distribution was presented through ArcGIS10.0, Excel and R software. Results According to the results of CoA, arteannuin B content presented a strong positive correlation with artemisinic acid content (p = 0), and a strong negative correlation with artemisinin content (p = 0). Scopoletin content presented a strong positive correlation with artemisinin content (p = 0), and a strong negative correlation with artemisinic acid content (p = 0). According to the results of PCA, the first two principal components accounted for 81.57% of the total accumulation contribution rate. The contribution of the first principal component is about 45.12%, manly including arteannuin B and artemisinic acid. The contribution of the second principal component is 36.45% of the total, manly including artemisinin and scopoletin. According to the ClA by using the principal component scores, 19 provinces could be divided into two groups. In terms of provinces in group one, the proportions of artemisinin are all higher than 80%. Based on the results of PCA, ClA, percentages and scatter plot analysis, chemical types are defined as ""QHYS type"", ""INT type"" and ""QHS type."" Conclusion As a conclusion, this paper shows the relationship between efficacy, chemical constituents and distribution. Sweet wormwood herb with high arteannuin B and artemisinic acid content, mainly distributes in northern China. Sweet wormwood herb with high artemisinin and scopoletin content has the medical function of preventing malaria, which mainly distributes in southern China. In this paper, it is proved that Sweet wormwood Daodi herb growing in particular geographic regions, has more significant therapeutical effect and higher chemical constituents compared with other same kind of CMM. And also, it has proved the old saying in China that Sweet wormwood Daodi herb which has been used to resolve summerheat-heat and prevent malaria, which distributed in central China. But in modern time, Daodi Sweet wormwood herb mainly has been used to extract artemisinin and prevent malaria, so the Daod-region has transferred to the southern China."
https://openalex.org/W2750948946,"Nogo receptor-1 (NgR1) and its ligands inhibit neuronal plasticity and limit functional recovery after brain damage such as ischemic stroke. We have previously shown that lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS) antagonizes NgR1-mediated signaling. Here, we investigated whether LOTUS enhances neuronal plasticity and functional recovery after brain focal ischemia in adult mice. Focal ischemic infarcts were induced in wild-type and LOTUS-overexpressing transgenic mice via middle cerebral artery occlusion. Endogenous LOTUS expression was increased in brain and cervical spinal cord of the contralateral side of ischemia in the chronic phase after brain ischemia. LOTUS overexpression accelerated midline-crossing axonal sprouting from the contralateral side to the ipsilateral side of ischemia in the medullar reticular formation and gray matter of denervated cervical spinal cord. Importantly, LOTUS overexpression improved neurological score highly correlated with laterality ratio of corticoreticular fibers of the medulla oblongata, indicating that LOTUS overexpression may overcome the inhibitory environment induced by NgR1 signaling for damaged motor pathway reconstruction after ischemic stroke. Thus, our data suggest that LOTUS overexpression accelerates neuronal plasticity in the brainstem and cervical spinal cord after stroke and LOTUS administration is useful for future therapeutic strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2753470565,"The tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus Linnaeus, 1758) is a temperate, coastal hound shark found in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific oceans. In this study, the population structure of Galeorhinus galeus was determined across the entire Southern Hemisphere, where the species is heavily targeted by commercial fisheries, as well as locally, along the South African coastline. Analysis was conducted on a total of 185 samples using 19 microsatellite markers and a 671 bp fragment of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) gene. Across the Southern Hemisphere, three geographically distinct clades were recovered, including one from South America (Argentina, Chile), one from Africa (all the South African collections) and an Australia-New Zealand clade. Nuclear data revealed significant population subdivisions (FST = 0.192 to 0.376, p<0.05) indicating limited gene flow for tope sharks across ocean basins. Marked population connectivity was however evident across the Indian Ocean based on Bayesian clustering analysis. More locally in South Africa, F-statistics and multivariate analysis supported moderate to high gene flow across the Atlantic/Indian Ocean boundary (FST = 0.035 to 0.044, p<0.05), with exception of samples from Struisbaai and Port Elizabeth which differed significantly from the rest. Discriminant and Bayesian clustering analysis indicated admixture in all sampling populations, decreasing from west to east, corroborating possible restriction to gene flow across regional oceanographic barriers. Mitochondrial sequence data recovered seven haplotypes (h = 0.216, π = 0.001) for South Africa, with one major haplotype shared by 87% of the individuals and at least one private haplotype for each sampling location except Port Elizabeth. As with many other coastal shark species with cosmopolitan distribution, this study confirms the lack of both historical dispersal and inter-oceanic gene flow while also implicating contemporary factors such as oceanic currents and thermal fronts to drive local genetic structure of G. galeus on a smaller spatial scale."
https://openalex.org/W2750879615,"Introduction We explored acceptability and feasibility of safer conception methods among HIV-affected couples in Uganda. Methods We recruited HIV-positive men and women on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (‘index’) from the Uganda Antiretroviral Rural Treatment Outcomes cohort who reported an HIV-negative or unknown-serostatus partner (‘partner’), HIV-serostatus disclosure to partner, and personal or partner desire for a child within two years. We conducted in-depth interviews with 40 individuals from 20 couples, using a narrative approach with tailored images to assess acceptability of five safer conception strategies: ART for the infected partner, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the uninfected partner, condomless sex timed to peak fertility, manual insemination, and male circumcision. Translated and transcribed data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results 11/20 index participants were women, median age of 32.5 years, median of 2 living children, and 80% had HIV-RNA <400 copies/mL. Awareness of HIV prevention strategies beyond condoms and abstinence was limited and precluded opportunity to explore or validly assess acceptability or feasibility of safer conception methods. Four key partnership communication challenges emerged as primary barriers to engagement in safer conception care, including: (1) HIV-serostatus disclosure: Although disclosure was an inclusion criterion, partners commonly reported not knowing the index partner’s HIV status. Similarly, the partner’s HIV-serostatus, as reported by the index, was frequently inaccurate. (2) Childbearing intention: Many couples had divergent childbearing intentions and made incorrect assumptions about their partner’s desires. (3) HIV risk perception: Participants had disparate understandings of HIV transmission and disagreed on the acceptable level of HIV risk to meet reproductive goals. (4) Partnership commitment: Participants revealed significant discord in perceptions of partnership commitment. All four types of partnership miscommunication introduced constraints to autonomous reproductive decision-making, particularly for women. Such miscommunication was common, as only 2 of 20 partnerships in our sample were mutually-disclosed with agreement across all four communication themes. Conclusions Enthusiasm for safer conception programming is growing. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing gendered partnership communication regarding HIV disclosure, reproductive goals, acceptable HIV risk, and commitment, alongside technical safer conception advice. Failing to consider partnership dynamics across these domains risks limiting reach, uptake, adherence to, and retention in safer conception programming."
https://openalex.org/W2751444860,"Glycosylation, oxidation and other post-translational modifications of membrane and transmembrane proteins can alter lipid density, packing and interactions, and are considered an important factor that affects fluidity variation in membranes. Red blood cells (RBC) membrane physical state, showing pronounced alterations in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), could be the ideal candidate for monitoring the disease progression and the effects of therapies. On these grounds, the measurement of RBC membrane fluidity alterations can furnish a more sensitive index in T1DM diagnosis and disease progression than Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which reflects only the information related to glycosylation processes. Here, through a functional two-photon microscopy approach we retrieved fluidity maps at submicrometric scale in RBC of T1DM patients with and without complications, detecting an altered membrane equilibrium. We found that a phase separation between fluid and rigid domains occurs, triggered by systemic effects on membranes fluidity of glycation and oxidation. The phase separation patterns are different among healthy, T1DM and T1DM with complications patients. Blood cholesterol and LDL content are positively correlated with the extent of the phase separation patterns. To quantify this extent a machine learning approach is employed to develop a Decision-Support-System (DSS) able to recognize different fluidity patterns in RBC. Preliminary analysis shows significant differences(p<0.001) among healthy, T1DM and T1DM with complications patients. The development of an assay based on Phase separation of the plasma membrane of the Red Blood cells is a potential tool for diagnosis and progression monitoring of type 1 diabetes mellitus, and could allow customization and the selection of medical treatments in T1DM in clinical settings, and enable the early detection of complications."
https://openalex.org/W2752726198,"Spider venoms are rich sources of peptidic ion channel modulators with important therapeutical potential. We screened a panel of 60 spider venoms to find modulators of ion channels involved in pain transmission. We isolated, synthesized and pharmacologically characterized Cd1a, a novel peptide from the venom of the spider Ceratogyrus darlingi. Cd1a reversibly paralysed sheep blowflies (PD50 of 1318 pmol/g) and inhibited human Cav2.2 (IC50 2.6 μM) but not Cav1.3 or Cav3.1 (IC50 > 30 μM) in fluorimetric assays. In patch-clamp electrophysiological assays Cd1a inhibited rat Cav2.2 with similar potency (IC50 3 μM) without influencing the voltage dependence of Cav2.2 activation gating, suggesting that Cd1a doesn’t act on Cav2.2 as a classical gating modifier toxin. The Cd1a binding site on Cav2.2 did not overlap with that of the pore blocker ω-conotoxin GVIA, but its activity at Cav2.2-mutant indicated that Cd1a shares some molecular determinants with GVIA and MVIIA, localized near the pore region. Cd1a also inhibited human Nav1.1–1.2 and Nav1.7–1.8 (IC50 0.1–6.9 μM) but not Nav1.3–1.6 (IC50 > 30 μM) in fluorimetric assays. In patch-clamp assays, Cd1a strongly inhibited human Nav1.7 (IC50 16 nM) and produced a 29 mV depolarising shift in Nav1.7 voltage dependence of activation. Cd1a (400 pmol) fully reversed Nav1.7-evoked pain behaviours in mice without producing side effects. In conclusion, Cd1a inhibited two anti-nociceptive targets, appearing to interfere with Cav2.2 inactivation gating, associated with the Cav2.2 α-subunit pore, while altering the activation gating of Nav1.7. Cd1a was inactive at some of the Nav and Cav channels expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles and nodes of Ranvier, apparently contributing to the lack of side effects at efficacious doses, and suggesting potential as a lead for development of peripheral pain treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2751794746,"CD4+ T-cell mediated Th1 immune responses are critical for immunity to TB. The immunomodulatory protein, lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) decreases Th1-type immune responses in T-cells. LAG-3 expression is significantly induced in the lungs of macaques with active TB and correlates with increased bacterial burden. Overproduction of LAG-3 can greatly diminish responses and could lead to uncontrolled Mtb replication. To assess the effect of LAG-3 on the progression of Mtb infection, we developed a co-culture system wherein blood-derived macrophages are infected with Mtb and supplemented with macaque blood or lung derived CD4+ T-cells. Silencing LAG-3 signaling in macaque lung CD4+ T-cells enhanced killing of Mtb in co-cultures, accompanied by reduced mitochondrial electron transport and increased IFN-γ expression. Thus, LAG-3 may modulate adaptive immunity to Mtb infection by interfering with the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Better understanding this pathway could allow us to circumvent immune features that promote disease."
https://openalex.org/W2750665614,"Agricultural management methods, such as cultivation or fallowing, have led to significant changes in soil fertility and hence, crop yield. Such changes may have stemmed from changes in soil microbial communities and associated biogeochemical processes. This phenomenon is particularly true in organic-poor soil in the Loess Plateau of China. In this study, we examined three existing soil management regimes as part of a 10-year field experiment and evaluated their effects on fungal and bacterial community structures by performing high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing. These management regimes were (i) fertilized winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (FW), (ii) continuous natural fallow with weeds but without crop grown (NF), and (iii) continuous bare fallow without weeds or crop grown (BF). After 10 years, soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and available potassium (K) concentrations were highest in NF. Soil N behaved differently, with BF obtaining the highest nitrate nitrogen (N). Meanwhile, slight differences in total N (TN) were observed among FW, NF, and BF. Available phosphorus (P) was highest and available K was lowest in FW. Microbial communities were dominated by Ascomycota (59.1% of fungal sequences), and Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria (75.7% of bacterial sequences) in FW, NF and BF at the phylum level. Soil management regimes did not affect the fungal and bacterial richness and diversity but significantly modified their community compositions. Compared with FW, the abundances of Ascomycota (fungi phylum) and Alternaria, Gibberella, and Emericella (fungi genus) were increased by NF, whereas the values of Chaetomium, Humicola, and Cryptococcus (fungi genus) were decreased by BF. The abundances of Verrucomicrobia (bacteria phylum), and Steroidobacter (bacteria genus) were increased by NF, and Bacteroides (bacteria genus) was increased by BF. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that SOC, available P, and TN might be the key factors in community formation. Therefore, the decadal absence of plants (BF) affected soil fertility by increased available K and nitrate N, whileas natural fallow (NF) affected soil fertility by increased SOC, available K, and MBC, and they all changed fungal and bacterial community compositions."

https://openalex.org/W2752563317,"Aims The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence rates of type 1 diabetes in Saxony before and after the German reunification. Methods The study examined two registries: one until 1990 and one since 1999. Only patients under 15 years of age with type 1 diabetes and living in Saxony were included in the study. Standardized incidence rates were described based on direct age standardization procedures using the Standard European Population for each calendar year between the observation periods 1982–1989 and 1999–2014. Age was grouped into three classes: 0–4, 5–9 and 10–14 years of age. Incidence data were presented as age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 person-years (PY) with 95% confidence intervals [CI]. Joinpoint regression was used for trend analyses and Poisson regression was used to adjust for the effects of age and sex on the incidence. Results A total number of 2,092 incident cases of type 1 diabetes (1,109 males; 983 females) were included. The age-standardized incidence rates of type 1 diabetes per 100,000 PY was 7.9 [95%CI 6.8; 8.9] in the period from 1982–1989 and 20.1 [95%CI 14.0; 26.1] in the period from 1999–2014. The yearly increase in incidence over the entire time period (1982–2014) was 4.3% according to the average annual percent change (AAPC) method, and estimated to be 4.4% [95% CI 4.0; 4.8%] using a Poisson regression model adjusting for sex and age group. Conclusion In this study, a significantly increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes was observed after reunification. In future studies it would be interesting to follow up on the question of which environmental and lifestyle factors could be causing the increasing type 1 diabetes incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2751520322,"Background India is considering the scale-up of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for detection of tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance. We conducted an economic analysis to estimate the costs of different strategies of Xpert implementation in India. Methods Using a decision analytical model, we compared four diagnostic strategies for TB patients: (i) sputum smear microscopy (SSM) only; (ii) Xpert as a replacement for the rapid diagnostic test currently used for SSM-positive patients at risk of drug resistance (i.e. line probe assay (LPA)); (iii) Upfront Xpert testing for patients at risk of drug resistance; and (iv) Xpert as a replacement for SSM for all patients. Results The total costs associated with diagnosis for 100,000 presumptive TB cases were: (i) US$ 619,042 for SSM-only; (ii) US$ 575,377 in the LPA replacement scenario; (iii) US$ 720,523 in the SSM replacement scenario; and (iv) US$ 1,639,643 in the Xpert-for-all scenario. Total cohort costs, including treatment costs, increased by 46% from the SSM-only to the Xpert-for-all strategy, largely due to the costs associated with second-line treatment of a higher number of rifampicin-resistant patients due to increased drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) case detection. The diagnostic costs for an estimated 7.64 million presumptive TB patients would comprise (i) 19%, (ii) 17%, (iii) 22% and (iv) 50% of the annual TB control budget. Mean total costs, expressed per DR-TB case initiated on treatment, were lowest in the Xpert-for-all scenario (US$ 11,099). Conclusions The Xpert-for-all strategy would result in the greatest increase of TB and DR-TB case detection, but would also have the highest associated costs. The strategy of using Xpert only for patients at risk for DR-TB would be more affordable, but would miss DR-TB cases and the cost per true DR-TB case detected would be higher compared to the Xpert-for-all strategy. As such expanded Xpert strategy would require significant increased TB control budget to ensure that increased case detection is followed by appropriate care."

Understanding the genetic control of Se content and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping provide a basis for Se biofortification of wheat to enhance grain Se content. In the present study, a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from two Chinese winter wheat varieties (Tainong18 and Linmai6) was used to detect QTLs for Se content in hydroponic and field trials. In total, 16 QTLs for six Se content-related traits were detected on eight chromosomes, 1B, 2B, 4B, 5A, 5B, 5D, 6A, and 7D. Of these, seven QTLs were detected at the seedling stage and nine at the adult stage. The contribution of each QTL to Se content ranged from 7.37% to 20.22%. QSsece-7D.2, located between marker loci D-3033829 and D-1668160, had the highest contribution (20.22%). This study helps in understanding the genetic basis for Se contents and will provide a basis for gene mapping of Se content in wheat."

https://openalex.org/W2751147119,"BRIL (bone-restricted IFITM-like), is a short transmembrane protein expressed almost exclusively in osteoblasts. Although much is known about its bone-restricted gene expression pattern and protein biochemical and topological features, little information is available for BRIL physiological function. Two autosomal dominant forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are caused by distinct, but recurrent mutations in the BRIL gene. Yet, the underlying mechanisms by which those mutations lead to OI are still poorly understood. A previous report indicated that BRIL knockout (KO) mice had bone deformities, shortened long bones, and reproductive problems. Here we generated and systematically analyzed the skeletal phenotype of a new global Bril KO/LacZ knockin mouse model. KO mice reproduced and thrived normally up to 12 month of age. The skeletal phenotype of KO and WT littermates was assessed at embryonic (E13.5 to E18.5) and postnatal (2 days, 3 weeks, 3 months and 8 months) time-points. Embryos from E13.5 through to E18.5 showed significant X-Gal staining in all skeletal elements without any apparent patterning anomalies. Although bone deformities were never observed at any postnatal ages, minor and transient differences were noted in terms of bone length and static uCT parameters, but not systematically across all ages and genders. These changes, however, were not accompanied by significant alteration in bone material properties as assessed by a 3-point bending test. In addition, no changes were detected in circulating serum markers of bone turnover (P1NP, CTX-I, and osteocalcin). Gene expression monitoring also revealed no major impact of the loss of BRIL. Further, when mice were challenged with a surgically-induced fracture in tibia, bones repaired equally well in the KO mice as compared to WT. Finally, we showed that BRIL C-terminus is not a bona fide binding site for calcium. In conclusion, our in depth analysis suggest that skeletal patterning, bone mass accrual and remodeling in mice proceeded independent of BRIL."
https://openalex.org/W2751959040,"Mammalian orthoreovirus protein μ2 is a component of the viral core particle. Its activities include RNA binding and hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate from NTPs and RNA 5´-termini, suggesting roles as a cofactor for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, λ3, first enzyme in 5´-capping of viral plus-strand RNAs, and/or prohibitory of RNA-5´-triphosphate-activated antiviral signaling. Within infected cells, μ2 also contributes to viral factories, cytoplasmic structures in which genome replication and particle assembly occur. By associating with both microtubules (MTs) and viral factory matrix protein μNS, μ2 can anchor the factories to MTs, the full effects of which remain unknown. In this study, a protease-hypersensitive region allowed μ2 to be dissected into two large fragments corresponding to residues 1–282 and 283–736. Fusions with enhanced green fluorescent protein revealed that these amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of μ2 associate in cells with either MTs or μNS, respectively. More exhaustive deletion analysis defined μ2 residues 1–325 as the minimal contiguous region that associates with MTs in the absence of the self-associating tag. A region involved in μ2 self-association was mapped to residues 283–325, and self-association involving this region was essential for MT-association as well. Likewise, we mapped that μNS-binding site in μ2 relates to residues 290–453 which is independent of μ2 self-association. These findings suggest that μ2 monomers or oligomers can bind to MTs and μNS, but that self-association involving μ2 residues 283–325 is specifically relevant for MT-association during viral factories formation."
https://openalex.org/W2752646661,"Background Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumor in adults. A key problem is the capacity of glioma cells to inactivate the body’s immune response. The complement system acts as a functional bridge between the innate and adaptive immune response. Still, the role of the complement system has almost been forgotten in glioma research. In our present study, we hypothesize that C1 inactivator (C1-IA) is upregulated in astrocytoma grade IV, and that its inhibition of the complement system has beneficial effects upon survival. Methods and results We have explored this hypothesis both on gene and protein levels and found an upregulation of C1-IA in human glioblastoma cells using data from a publicly available database and our own mRNA material from glioblastoma patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated the presence of C1-IA by using immunohistochemistry on glioma cells from both humans and rats in vitro. Finally, we could demonstrate a significantly increased survival in vivo in animals inoculated intracerebrally with glioma cells pre-coated with C1-IA antibodies as compared to control animals. Conclusions Our findings indicate that overexpression of C1-IA is present in glioblastomas. This could be demonstrated both at the gene level from patients with glioblastoma, on mRNA level and with immunohistochemistry. Treatment with antibodies against C1-IA had beneficial effects on survival when tested in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2750681714,"Palm kernel cake (PKC) is the main byproduct from the palm oil industry in several tropical countries that contains considerable amounts of oligosaccharide. We earlier demonstrated beneficial prebiotic effects of oligosaccharides extract of PKC (OligoPKC) in starter and finisher broiler birds. This study was envisaged to elucidate the effects of in ovo and/or oral administration of the OligoPKC on prenatal and post-hatched broiler chicks. A total of 140 broiler (Cobb500) eggs were randomly divided into two groups (n = 70 each), and on day 12 of incubation, eggs in one group received in ovo injection of 0.1 mL (containing 20 mg) of OligoPKC, while those in the other group received 0.1 mL of saline (placebo) solution. Of these in ovo placebo or OligoPKC injected eggs, after hatching, six chicks from each group were sampled for day-one analysis, while 48 chicks from each group were randomly allocated to two dietary regimes involving either no feeding or feeding of OligoPKC through basal diet for a 14 days experiment forming the experimental groups as: (i) saline-injected (Control, C), (ii) OligoPKC-injected (PREBovo), (iii) saline-injected, but fed 1% OligoPKC (PREBd), and (iv) OligoPKC-injected and also 1% OligoPKC (PREBovo+d). In ovo injection of prebiotic OligoPKC had no effect on body weight and serum immunoglobulins concentrations of day old chicks, except for IgG, which was increased significantly (P<0.05). Body weight and feed conversion ratio of 14 days old chicks were neither affected by in ovo injection nor feeding of OligoPKC. However, populations of cecal total bacteria and major beneficial bacteria of the chicks were markedly enhanced by feeding of OligoPKC (PREBd and PREBovo+d > C and PREBovo), but lesser influenced by in ovo OligoPKC injection. Irrespective of its prior in ovo exposure, chicks fed OligoPKC diets had lower population of pathogenic bacteria. Overall serum immunoglobulin status of birds was improved by feeding of OligoPKC but in ovo OligoPKC injection had minor effect on that. In most cases, in ovo OligoPKC injection and feeding of OligoPKC reduced the expression of nutrient transporters in the intestine and improved antioxidant capacity of liver and serum. It is concluded that in ovo injection of OligoPKC increased IgG production and antioxidant capacity in serum and liver of prenatal chicks and had limited carrying-over effects on the post-hatched chicks comparing to the supplementary feeding of OligoPKC."
https://openalex.org/W2752571593,"Impairments in cognition, pain intolerance, and physical inactivity characterize adolescent chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), yet little is known about its neurobiology. The right dorsal anterior insular (dAI) connectivity of the salience network provides a motivational context to stimuli. In this study, we examined regional functional connectivity (FC) patterns of the right dAI in adolescent CFS patients and healthy participants. Eighteen adolescent patients with CFS and 18 aged-matched healthy adolescent control participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The right dAI region of interest was examined in a seed-to-voxel resting-state FC analysis using SPM and CONN toolbox. Relative to healthy adolescents, CFS patients demonstrated reduced FC of the right dAI to the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) node of the central executive network. The decreased FC of the right dAI-PPC might indicate impaired cognitive control development in adolescent CFS. Immature FC of the right dAI-PPC in patients also lacked associations with three known functional domains: cognition, pain and physical activity, which were observed in the healthy group. These results suggest a distinct biological signature of adolescent CFS and might represent a fundamental role of the dAI in motivated behavior."

Though there is a notable decline in new HIV infections, continued effort is still needed to develop an efficacious, accessible and affordable HIV vaccine. HIV vaccine clinical trials bear risks, hence a need to understand volunteer motivators for enrolment, retention and follow-up. Understanding the factors that motivate volunteers to participate in a clinical trial can help to strategize, refine targeting and thus increase enrolment of volunteers in future HIV vaccine clinical trials. The health belief model classifies motivators into social benefits such as 'advancing research' and collaboration with science, and personal benefits such as health benefits and financial interests.A thematic analysis was carried out on data obtained from four HIV clinical trials conducted at KAVI-Institute of Clinical Research in Nairobi Kenya from 2009 to 2015. Responses were obtained from a Questionnaire administered to the volunteers during their screening visit at the research site.Of the 281 healthy, HIV-uninfected volunteers participating in this study; 38% were motivated by personal benefits including, 31% motivated by health benefits and 7% motivated by possible financial gains. In addition, 62% of the volunteers were motivated by social benefits with 20% of who were seeking to help their family/society/world while 42% were interested in advancing research.The majority of volunteers in the HIV vaccine trials at our site were motivated by social benefits, suggesting that altruism can be a major contributor to participation in HIV vaccine studies. Personal benefits were a secondary motivator for the volunteers. The motivators to volunteer in HIV clinical trials were similar across ages, education level and gender. Education on what is needed (including volunteer participation) to develop an efficacious vaccine could be the key to greater volunteer motivation to participate in HIV vaccine clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2753933141,"Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a G-protein–coupled receptor expressed in the brain’s hypothalamus where it regulates energy homeostasis. MC4R agonists function to lower food intake and weight. In this respect, although obesity promotes hyperlipidemia and hypothalamic injury, MC4R agonists are nevertheless more effective to reduce food intake within hours of administration in overweight, rather than lean, mice. MC4R undergoes constitutive internalization and recycling to the plasma membrane with agonist binding inducing receptor retention along the intracellular route and, under prolonged exposure, desensitization. Here, we found that, in neuronal cells, lipid stress by exposure to elevated palmitate leaves unchanged the rate by which MC4R and transferrin receptor are constitutively excluded from the cell surface. However, lipid stress disrupted later steps of MC4R and transferrin receptor internalization to endosomes as well as traffic of agonist-occupied MC4R to lysosomes and MC4R desensitization. In the lipid-stressed cells, MC4R and clathrin were redistributed to the plasma membrane where they colocalized to sites that appeared by super-resolution microscopy to be modified and to have higher clathrin content than those of cells not exposed to elevated palmitate. The data suggest that lipid stress disrupts steps of endocytosis following MC4R localization to clathrin-coated sites and exclusion of the receptor from the extracellular medium. We conclude that increased effectiveness of MC4R agonists in obesity may be an unexpected outcome of neuronal injury with disrupted clathrin-dependent endocytosis and impaired receptor desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2753365911,"The neonatal Fc receptor FcRn plays a critical role in the trafficking of IgGs across tissue barriers and in retaining high circulating concentrations of both IgG and albumin. Although generally beneficial from an immunological perspective in maintaining IgG populations, FcRn can contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders when an abnormal immune response targets normal biological components. We previously described a monoclonal antibody (DX-2507) that binds to FcRn with high affinity at both neutral and acidic pH, prevents the simultaneous binding of IgG, and reduces circulating IgG levels in preclinical animal models. Here, we report a 2.5 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of an FcRn-DX-2507 Fab complex, revealing a nearly complete overlap of the IgG-Fc binding site in FcRn by complementarity-determining regions in DX-2507. This overlap explains how DX-2507 blocks IgG binding to FcRn and thereby shortens IgG half-life by preventing IgGs from recycling back into circulation. Moreover, the complex structure explains how the DX-2507 interaction is pH-insensitive unlike normal Fc interactions and how serum albumin levels are unaffected by DX-2507 binding. These structural studies could inform antibody-based therapeutic approaches for limiting the effects of IgG-mediated autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2751639769,"The metastatic activity of breast carcinomas results from complex genetic changes in epithelial tumor cells and accounts for 90% of deaths in affected patients. Although the invasion of the local lymphatic vessels and veins by malignant breast tumor cells and their subsequent metastasis to the lung, has been recognized, the mechanisms behind the metastatic activity of breast tumor cells to other distal organs and the pathogenesis of metastatic cancer are not well understood. In this study, we utilized derivatives of the well-established and highly metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) to study breast tumor metastasis in a mouse model. These MDA-231 derivatives had depleted expression of Kaiso, a POZ-ZF transcription factor that is highly expressed in malignant, triple negative breast cancers. We previously reported that Kaiso depletion attenuates the metastasis of xenografted MDA-231 cells. Herein, we describe the pathological features of the metastatic activity of parental (Kaisopositive) versus Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells. Both Kaisopositive and Kaisodepleted MDA-231 cells metastasized from the original tumor in the mammary fat pad to the lung. However, while Kaisopositive cells formed large masses in the lung parenchyma, invaded large pulmonary blood vessels and formed secondary metastases and large tumors in the distal organs, Kaisodepleted cells metastasized only to the lung where they formed small metastatic lesions. Importantly, intravascular invasion and secondary metastases in distal organs were not observed in mice xenografted with Kaisodepleted cells. It thus appears that the lung may constitute a barrier for less invasive breast tumors such as the Kaisodepleted TNBC cells; this barrier may limit tumor growth and prevents Kaisodepleted TNBC cells from invading the pulmonary blood vessels and forming secondary metastases in distal organs."
https://openalex.org/W2753785822,"The classical swine fever virus (CSFV), circulating worldwide, is a highly contagious virus. Since the emergence of CSFV, it has caused great economic loss in swine industry. The envelope glycoprotein E2 gene of the CSFV is an immunoprotective antigen that induces the immune system to produce neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, it is essential to study the codon usage of the E2 gene of the CSFV. In this study, 140 coding sequences of the E2 gene were analyzed. The value of effective number of codons (ENC) showed low codon usage bias in the E2 gene. Our study showed that codon usage could be described mainly by mutation pressure ENC plot analysis combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and translational selection-correlation analysis between the general average hydropathicity (Gravy) and aromaticity (Aroma), and nucleotides at the third position of codons (A3s, T3s, G3s, C3s and GC3s). Furthermore, the neutrality analysis, which explained the relationship between GC12s and GC3s, revealed that natural selection had a key role compared with mutational bias during the evolution of the E2 gene. These results lay a foundation for further research on the molecular evolution of CSFV."

We hypothesized, that clonidine used as an adjuvant to ropivacaine extends the duration of an adductor canal block (ACB) by a peripheral mechanism, compared to ropivacaine alone when controlling for systemic effects.We conducted a paired, blinded, randomized trial in healthy volunteers. Participants received bilateral ACBs containing 20 ml ropivacaine 0.5% + 1 ml clonidine 150μg/ml in one leg and 20 ml ropivacaine 0.5% + 1 ml saline in the other leg. The primary outcome measure was duration of sensory block assessed by temperature sensation (alcohol swab). Secondary outcome measures were duration of sensory block assessed by: pinprick, maximum pain during tonic heat stimulation, warmth detection threshold and heat pain detection threshold.We enrolled 21 volunteers and all completed the trial. There was no difference in duration of sensory block assessed with an alcohol swab: Mean duration in the leg receiving ropivacaine + clonidine was 19.4h (SD 2.7) compared to 19.3h (SD 2.4) in the leg receiving ropivacaine + placebo with a mean difference of 0.1h (95% CI: -1.0 to 1.3), P = 0.83.

https://openalex.org/W2753867490,"A cable model that includes polarization-induced capacitive current is derived for modeling the solitonic conduction of electrotonic potentials in neuronal branchlets with microstructure containing endoplasmic membranes. A solution of the nonlinear cable equation modified for fissured intracellular medium with a source term representing charge 'soakage' is used to show how intracellular capacitive effects of bound electrical charges within mitochondrial membranes can influence electrotonic signals expressed as solitary waves. The elastic collision resulting from a head-on collision of two solitary waves results in localized and non-dispersing electrical solitons created by the nonlinearity of the source term. It has been shown that solitons in neurons with mitochondrial membrane and quasi-electrostatic interactions of charges held by the microstructure (i.e., charge 'soakage') have a slower velocity of propagation compared with solitons in neurons with microstructure, but without endoplasmic membranes. When the equilibrium potential is a small deviation from rest, the nonohmic conductance acts as a leaky channel and the solitons are small compared when the equilibrium potential is large and the outer mitochondrial membrane acts as an amplifier, boosting the amplitude of the endogenously generated solitons. These findings demonstrate a functional role of quasi-electrostatic interactions of bound electrical charges held by microstructure for sustaining solitons with robust self-regulation in their amplitude through changes in the mitochondrial membrane equilibrium potential. The implication of our results indicate that a phenomenological description of ionic current can be successfully modeled with displacement current in Maxwell's equations as a conduction process involving quasi-electrostatic interactions without the inclusion of diffusive current. This is the first study in which solitonic conduction of electrotonic potentials are generated by polarization-induced capacitive current in microstructure and nonohmic mitochondrial membrane current."
https://openalex.org/W2753232253,"Hydrothermal vent organisms are adapted to their extreme and patchily distributed habitats. They are expected to have evolved mechanisms that keep them in their specific habitation. Since little is known about the recruitment or habitat selection of HV organisms such as brachyurans, we examined the properties of several hydrothermal vent-associated cues on the behavior of the hydrothermal vent (HV) crab Xenograpsus testudinatus in the laboratory that were contrasted by the offering of non-vent cues. This crab species is endemic and dominates the vent fauna of Turtle Island off the NE coast of Taiwan. HV crabs were separately and in combination offered the following vent-specific cues: (1) sulfuric sediment, (3) air-bubbling, (4) elevated temperature, (5) dead settled zooplankton, (7) other crabs, and (8) shade. The non-vent-specific cues were: (2) quarz sediment, (6) dead fish, (8) light. These cues were provided on either side of a two-choice chamber. The movement of individual crabs was monitored: as initial and final choices, and as the proportion of time the crabs spent in each compartment (resident time). Cues were offered alone and no such cue as a control in the same set-up. Sulfuric sediments and dead fish were significantly more attractive to females, and other crabs irrespective of gender were significantly more attractive to males. When compared to expected distributions, crabs, irrespective of gender, significantly avoided light and tended to select other crabs, air-bubbling, sulfuric sediment, elevated temperature, dead fish, dead zooplankton, and quarz sediments in the order of decreasing importance. Data do not support the hypothesis that dead settled zooplankton was particularly attractive nor that the other gender was selected. A combination of several vent-associated cues (sulfuric sediment, elevated temperature, air-bubbling) facilitated the strongest attraction to the crabs as reflected by all response variables. The 'first choice' responses were always consistent with the side of the choice compartment in which they spent the longest amount of time (resident time), but not with the 'final choice' of crabs, suggesting that the 'resident time' in addition to their 'first choice' is more reliable than just the 'final choice'. The present results provide the first indication that several vent-associated habitat cues function as attractors for HV crabs. Habitat choice is also reflected by crab larval distribution in the field which tend to stay near the bottom not to be carried away from their specific habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2751466336,"Cortical porosity is a key characteristic governing the structural properties and mechanical behaviour of bone, and its quantification is therefore critical for understanding and monitoring the development of various bone pathologies such as osteoporosis. Axial transmission quantitative acoustics has shown to be a promising technique for assessing bone health in a fast, non-invasive, and radiation-free manner. One major hurdle in bringing this approach to clinical application is the entanglement of the effects of individual characteristics (e.g. geometry, porosity, anisotropy etc.) on the measured wave propagation. In order to address this entanglement problem, we therefore propose a systematic bottom-up approach, in which only one bone property is varied, before addressing interaction effects. This work therefore investigated the sensitivity of low-frequency quantitative acoustics to changes in porosity as well as individual pore characteristics using specifically designed cortical bone phantoms.14 bone phantoms were designed with varying pore size, axial-, and radial pore number, resulting in porosities (bone volume fraction) between 0% and 15%, similar to porosity values found in human cortical bone. All phantoms were manufactured using laser sintering, measured using axial-transmission acoustics and analysed using a full-wave approach. Experimental results were compared to theoretical predictions based on a modified Timoshenko theory.A clear dependence of phase velocity on frequency and porosity produced by increasing pore size or radial pore number was demonstrated, with the velocity decreasing by between 2-5 m/s per percent of additional porosity, which corresponds to -0.5% to -1.0% of wave speed. While the change in phase velocity due to axial pore number was consistent with the results due to pore size and radial pore number, the relative uncertainties for the estimates were too high to draw any conclusions for this parameter.This work has shown the capability of low-frequency quantitative acoustics to reflect changes in porosity and individual pore characteristics and demonstrated that additive manufacturing is an appropriate method that allows the influence of individual bone properties on the wave propagation to be systematically assessed. The results of this work opens perspectives for the efficient development of a multi-frequency, multi-mode approach to screen, diagnose, and monitor bone pathologies in individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2753401870,"Signaling via the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel C6 plays a pivotal role in hereditary and sporadic glomerular kidney disease. Several studies have identified gain-of-function mutations of TRPC6 and report induced expression and enhanced channel activity of TRPC6 in association with glomerular diseases. Interfering with TRPC6 activity may open novel therapeutic pathways. TRPC6 channel activity is controlled by protein expression and stability as well as intracellular trafficking. Identification of regulatory phosphorylation sites in TRPC6 and corresponding protein kinases is essential to understand the regulation of TRPC6 activity and may result in future therapeutic strategies. In this study, an unbiased phosphoproteomic screen of human TRPC6 identified several novel serine phosphorylation sites. The phosphorylation site at serine 14 of TRPC6 is embedded in a basophilic kinase motif that is highly conserved across species. We confirmed serine 14 as a target of MAPKs and proline-directed kinases like cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in cell-based as well as in vitro kinase assays and quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of TRPC6. Phosphorylation of TRPC6 at serine 14 enhances channel conductance by boosting membrane expression of TRPC6, whereas protein stability and multimerization of TRPC6 are not altered, making serine 14 phosphorylation a potential drug target to interfere with TRPC6 channel activity.—Hagmann, H., Mangold, N., Rinschen, M. M., Koenig, T., Kunzelmann, K., Schermer, B., Benzing, T., Brinkkoetter, P. T.

https://openalex.org/W2751746371,"Rather than relying solely on subjective pain evaluation using means such as the visual analogue scale (VAS), in clinical situations it is possible to observe evoked responses of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) as objective indicators. Few studies, however, have reported these relationships under finely controlled sedation. 16 healthy male participants were administrated in intravenous sedation with either propofol or midazolam randomly. We initially determined, using pharmacokinetic simulation, the effect-site concentration (Ce) of anaesthetic at loss of response to verbal command and eyelash reflex (Ce-LOR). Then subsequently adjusted Ce to 75%, 50%, and 25% of Ce-LOR to achieve deep, moderate, and light sedation. At awake control state and each sedation level, a noxious electrical stimulation was applied three times at the right forearm, an average pain intensity of the three stimuli was rated on a VAS (0–10). Changes in the peripheral perfusion index measured by oximetry were used as an indicator of ANS response. We analyzed the influence of sedation level on VAS and ANS responses compared to the awake control state. While ANS responses were similar in all conditions, VAS was statistically significantly lower in moderate (5.6±0.6, p <0.005) or deep (5.3±0.6, p <0.001) sedation than in the awake state (7.2±0.4). This study revealed that even when the ANS responds similarly to the same stimulation, subjective pain perception is attenuated by sedation. A cerebral mechanism other than that of the brainstem might determine subjective pain intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2752300473,"Combinations of different antibodies have been shown to be more effective for managing certain diseases than monotherapy. Co-expression of the antibody mixture in a single cell line is key to reducing complexity during antibody development and manufacturing. However, co-transfection of multiple light and heavy chains into cells often leads to production of mismatched, heterodimeric by-products that are inactive, making the development of co-expression systems that robustly and efficiently produce highly active antibody mixtures a high priority. In this study, we modified the CH3 domain interface of the antibody fragment crystallizable (Fc) region by changing several charge pairs to create electrostatic interactions favoring Fc homodimer formation and disfavoring Fc heterodimer formation. When co-expressed, these modified antibodies with altered charge polarity across the Fc dimer interface preferentially formed homodimers that fully preserved the functions of each component, rather than inactive heterodimers whose formation was reduced because of rationally designed repulsive interactions. We designed eight different combinations and experimentally screened the best one, which enabled us to produce a binary antibody mixture against the EGF receptor with a minimal heterodimer contaminant. We further determined the crystal structure of a triple-mutated Fc variant in the best combination, and we elucidated the molecular interactions favoring Fc homodimer over heterodimer formation, which provided a structural basis for further optimization. The approach presented here demonstrates the feasibility of rational antibody modification for efficient and consistent production of monoclonal antibody mixtures in a single cell line and thus broadens our options for manufacturing more effective antibody-based therapeutic agents.

https://openalex.org/W2751696542,"Pregnancy increases the risk of morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease. We previously showed pregnant women with sickle cell disease to have a relatively low plasma renin concentration in late pregnancy, associated with a lack of the expected plasma volume expansion. We hypothesized this to be due to increased systemic vascular resistance through an imbalance between the vasodilator prostacyclin and vasoconstrictor thromboxane, associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).To compare estimated prostacyclin, thromboxane and GFR in non-pregnant and pregnant women with hemoglobin SS (HbSS) and AA (HbAA).Four groups of 20 normotensive, nulliparous women were studied in Lagos, Nigeria: pregnant HbSS or HbAA women at 36-40 weeks gestation; non-pregnant HbSS and HbAA controls. We measured stable metabolites of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GFR using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Data analysis was by independent (Student's) t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for comparisons between any two groups of continuous variables, univariate ANOVA for multiple groups and Pearson's correlation coefficient for degree of association between variables.HbSS women had lower serum 6-keto-PGF1α concentrations than HbAA, whether pregnant or non-pregnant (P<0.001; P<0.004 respectively). Conversely, pregnant HbSS women had higher serum TxB2 (P<0.001); non-pregnant HbSS women had non-significantly higher TxB2 concentrations. The 6-keto-PGF1α:TxB2 ratio was markedly increased (pro-vasodilatory) in HbAA pregnancy (P<0.001) but reduced in HbSS pregnancy (P = 0.037). GFRs (mL/min) were higher in non-pregnant HbSS than HbAA (P<0.008) but only marginally raised in HbSS women in late pregnancy (P = 0.019) while markedly raised in HbAA pregnancy (P<0.001).The lower ratio of prostacyclin-thromboxane metabolites in HbSS pregnancy may indicate endothelial damage and an increased tendency to vasoconstriction and clotting. If confirmed by subsequent longitudinal studies, interventions to increase prostacyclin and reduce thromboxane, such as low dose aspirin, may be potentially useful in their management."
https://openalex.org/W2751214759,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. Drugs acting as positive allosteric modulators of muscle-type α2βγδ nAChRs, of use in treatment of neuromuscular disorders, have been hard to identify. However, identification of nAChR allosteric modulator binding sites has been facilitated by using drugs developed as photoreactive GABAAR modulators. Recently, R-1-methyl-5-allyl-5-(m-trifluoromethyl-diazirinylphenyl) barbituric acid (R-mTFD-MPAB), an anesthetic and GABAAR potentiator, has been shown to inhibit Torpedo α2βγδ nAChRs, binding in the ion channel and to a γ+-α- subunit interface site similar to its GABAAR intersubunit binding site. In contrast, S-1-methyl-5-propyl-5-(m-trifluoromethyl-diazirinylphenyl) barbituric acid (S-mTFD-MPPB) acts as a convulsant and GABAAR inhibitor. Photolabeling studies established that S-mTFD-MPPB binds to the same GABAAR intersubunit binding site as R-mTFD-MPAB, but with negative rather than positive energetic coupling to GABA binding. We now show that S-mTFD-MPPB binds with the same state (agonist) dependence as R-mTFD-MPAB within the nAChR ion channel, but it does not bind to the intersubunit binding site. Rather, S-mTFD-MPPB binds to intrasubunit sites within the α and δ subunits, photolabeling αVal-218 (αM1), δPhe-232 (δM1), δThr-274 (δM2), and δIle-288 (δM3). Propofol, a general anesthetic that binds to GABAAR intersubunit sites, inhibited [3H]S-mTFD-MPPB photolabeling of these nAChR intrasubunit binding sites. These results demonstrate that in an nAChR, the subtle difference in structure between S-mTFD-MPPB and R-mTFD-MPAB (chirality; 5-propyl versus 5-allyl) determines selectivity for intra- versus intersubunit sites, in contrast to GABAARs, where this difference affects state dependence of binding to a common site."
