https://openalex.org/W2081335687,"The pentapeptide arginyl-lysyl-aspartyl-valyl-tyrosine, corresponding to amino acid residues 32--36 in thymopoietin, was synthesized. In vitro, this pentapeptide induced the differentiation of murine prothymocytes to thymocytes and inhibited differentiative induction of cells of the B lineage. This combination of actions is presently unique to the parent molecule thymopoietin. In vivo, the pentapeptide reduced the high numbers of autologous rosette-forming cells normally present in the spleens of athymic mice; this also is a property of thymopoietin. These results suggest that this readily synthesized pentapeptide corresponds to an active site of thymopoietin and might serve as a therapeutic substitute for thymopoietin."

https://openalex.org/W1973334712,"The kidneys are thought to be the only organs capable of 1 alpha-hydroxylation of vitamin D and its metabolites. We have examined the in vivo conversion of 3H-(25,26)-25-hydroxyvitamin D3(25OHD3) to 3H-(25,26)-1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha,25(OH)2D3] in vitamin D-deficient, pregnant and nonpregnant rats. As expected, nephrectomy of nonpregnant, vitamin D-deficient rats prevented the conversion of 25OHD3 to 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. In contrast, nephrectomy of pregnant, vitamin D-deficient rats reduced but did not abolish the formation of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 from its precursor. The identity of the radioactive metabolite formed from 3H-25OHD3 which circulated in nephrectomized, pregnant rats was established as 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 by comigration with synthetic 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 on high-pressure liquid chromatography. The simultaneous absence of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 in the fetal kidneys indicated that the site of 1 alpha-hydroxylation after nephrectomy of the pregnant rat was probably extra-renal in origin. Two sites of 1 alpha-hydroxylation of 25OHD3, one renal and the other extra-renal, either fetoplacental or maternal, may exist in the pregnant, vitamin D-deficient rat."

This model has been used to phase a reconstructed image from X-ray amplitudes, which is compatible with the electron microscope results."

https://openalex.org/W2051964261,"Swiss 3T3 cells arrested in G0 (quiescent state) by reducing serum content of the medium all contain the same amount of DNA but vary in nuclear volume over approximately a twofold range. By use of flow microfluorimetry, scatterplots of nuclear volume versus DNA content were obtained in intervals after serum stimulation. The earliest cells to enter DNA synthesis were those with the largest nuclei, whereas cells with the smallest nuclei were among the latest. Regulation of cellular transit from G0 to the S phase was therefore, at least in part, deterministic, since all G0 cells did not have equal probabilities of entry into S at a given moment. All cells having the same nuclear volume did not initiate DNA synthesis at the same moment; therefore, factors other than nuclear volume must also influence this timing. Nuclear volume correlated with the maximum rate at which cells could enter S. The kinetic model of the cell cycle postulating a probabilistic event as solely responsible for entry into S thus appears too simple."

https://openalex.org/W4230959959,Direct antibody-sensing membrane electrodes have been developed by immobilizing ion-carrier immunogen conjugates in a liquid membrane matrix. The resulting potentiometric probes measure specific antibodies with high selectivity over nonspecific antibodies in the physiological pH range. The electrode response is shown to arise from the selective interaction of the antibody with the membrane-bound immunogen.

Among 29 offspring in two stallion families there was evidence for one recombinant. Lod scores for linkage between the A and ELA loci in the two families were 3.61 and 3.33, respectively, for theta equal to 0."

https://openalex.org/W2070128253,"PATTERNS of near-parallel black-and-white lines induce an anomalous state of the visual system, in which a superimposed test field of dynamic noise (such as the ‘snowstorm’ on a detuned TV receiver) seems to stream in directions roughly perpendicular to the inducing contours1. The illusory streamers form a ‘complementary image’ (CI) which for the stimulus of Fig. 1a comprises a family of wavy circles, as sketched by J. P. Wilson2 in Fig. 1b. When two orthogonal gratings are superimposed, the streamers lie at 45° to both, as if the resulting bias obeys the rule of vector summation3. J. P. Wilson4 has observed rudimentary signs of directional bias and streaming even at a single black/white contour; and M. E. Wilson5, using only simple pairs of test spots illuminated in sequence, found that the illusory ‘phi’ motion seen between the spots was enhanced for directions orthogonal to the contours of a superimposed grating. When the inducing pattern is presented to one eye and the noise field to the other, however, little or no CI is observed1,6. It has seemed logical1 to attribute these phenomena to some form of adaptive cooperative activity among orientation-sensitive cells of the visual system, leading to a kind of ‘simultaneous contrast’ in the orientation domain, that is, a bias of the signalling system for motion and contour orientation in favour of the orientation(s) not present in the inducing stimulus."
