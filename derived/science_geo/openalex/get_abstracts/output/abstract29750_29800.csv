https://openalex.org/W2046577583,The pacemaker role of the suprachiasmatic nucleus in a mammalian circadian system was tested by neural transplantation by using a mutant strain of hamster that shows a short circadian period. Small neural grafts from the suprachiasmatic region restored circadian rhythms to arrhythmic animals whose own nucleus had been ablated. The restored rhythms always exhibited the period of the donor genotype regardless of the direction of the transplant or genotype of the host. The basic period of the overt circadian rhythm therefore is determined by cells of the suprachiasmatic region.

https://openalex.org/W2043899013,"Sulfonylurea-sensitive adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-regulated potassium (KATP) channels are present in brain cells and play a role in neurosecretion at nerve terminals. KATP channels in substantia nigra, a brain region that shows high sulfonylurea binding, are inactivated by high glucose concentrations and by antidiabetic sulfonylureas and are activated by ATP depletion and anoxia. KATP channel inhibition leads to activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release, whereas KATP channel activation leads to inhibition of GABA release. These channels may be involved in the response of the brain to hyper- and hypoglycemia (in diabetes) and ischemia or anoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2061671663,"Identification of a mutant epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor that does not undergo downregulation has provided a genetic probe to investigate the role of internalization in ligand-induced mitogenesis. Contact-inhibited cells expressing this internalization-defective receptor exhibited a normal mitogenic response at significantly lower ligand concentrations than did cells expressing wild-type receptors. A transformed phenotype and anchorage-independent growth were observed at ligand concentrations that failed to elicit these responses in cells expressing wild-type receptors. These findings imply that activation of the protein tyrosine kinase activity at the cell membrane is sufficient for the growth-enhancing effects of EGF. Thus, downregulation can serve as an attenuation mechanism, without which transformation ensues."

https://openalex.org/W1510072729,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated hydrolysis of triglycerides (TG) contained in chylomicrons requires the presence of a cofactor, apolipoprotein (apo) C-II. The physiological mechanism by which chylomicrons gain apoC-II necessary for LPL activation in whole plasma is not known. Using a gum arabic stabilized TG emulsion, activation of LPL by lipoprotein apoC-II was studied. Hydrolysis of TG by LPL was greater in the presence of serum than with addition of either high density lipoproteins (HDL) or very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). LPL activation by either VLDL or HDL increased with addition of the lipoprotein-free fraction of plasma. A similar increase in LPL activity by addition of the lipoprotein-free fraction together with HDL or VLDL was observed when another TG emulsion (Intralipid) or TG-rich lipoproteins from an apoC-II deficient subject were used as a substrate. Human apoA-IV, apoA-I, apoE, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein were assessed for their ability to increase LPL activity in the presence of VLDL. At and below physiological concentrations, only apoA-IV increased LPL activity. One hundred percent of LPL activity measured in the presence of serum was achieved using VLDL plus apoA-IV. In the absence of an apoC-II source, apoA-IV had no effect on LPL activity. Removal of greater than 80% of the apoA-IV from the nonlipoprotein-containing fraction of plasma by incubation with Intralipid markedly reduced its ability to activate LPL in the presence of VLDL or HDL. Gel filtration chromatography demonstrated that incubation of the nonlipoprotein-containing fraction of plasma with HDL and the TG emulsion caused increased transfer of apoC-II to the emulsion and association of apoA-IV with HDL. Our studies demonstrate that apoA-IV increases LPL activation in the presence of lipoproteins. We hypothesize that apoA-IV is required for efficient release of apoC-II from either HDL or VLDL, which then allows for LPL-mediated hydrolysis of TG in nascent chylomicrons."

https://openalex.org/W1514228149,"Progesterone receptor complexes were purified from crude cytosol in a rapid, gentle, one-step procedure using anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies covalently attached to an agarose resin. Five nonreceptor proteins specifically co-purified with unactivated avian progesterone receptor; these proteins had molecular masses of approximately 90, 70, 54, 50, and 23 kDa. The 90- and 70-kDa proteins have been previously identified as the 90-kDa heat shock protein and a member of the 70-kDa heat shock protein family, respectively. The 54-, 50-, and 23-kDa proteins have not been previously described as associated with avian progesterone receptor. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed charge heterogeneities for all five proteins. Except for p70, each could be dissociated from receptor by salt, a process inhibited by sodium molybdate. However, molybdate was not required for protein association with receptor in low ionic strength. Following progesterone treatment in vivo p70 still co-purified with cytosolic receptor although the other affiliated proteins were reduced, suggesting hormone-dependent dissociation in conjunction with receptor activation. One of the proteins, p54, displayed in vitro hormone-dependent dissociation which was not prevented by molybdate."
https://openalex.org/W1506088182,"A dual, digital, indo-1 fluorescence imaging system was used to obtain high-speed ratiometric images of [Ca2+]i waves in single voltage-clamped mammalian cardiac cells. The spatiotemporal origin of [Ca2+]i waves in depolarized cells was detected as the spontaneous appearance, over 100-300 ms, of domelike regions of elevated [Ca2+]i, approximately 20 microns in diameter and 300 nM at the center. Images of [Ca2+]i taken at 67-ms intervals during propagation of [Ca2+]i waves revealed that the [Ca2+]i wave front was 1) constant in shape, 2) spatially steep, typically rising from 500 to 1200 nM in about 10 microns, and 3) propagating at constant velocity, typically 100 microns/s at 22 degrees C. The observed spatial and temporal patterns of origin and propagation of [Ca2+]i waves are consistent with the hypothesis that [Ca2+]i waves arise from propagating Ca2(+)-induced release of Ca2+ mediated by diffusion of cytosolic Ca2+. The [Ca2+]i waves are smaller in peak magnitude and can occupy a larger fraction of the cell than thought previously on the basis of indirect observations."
https://openalex.org/W2071363520,"Reactive or unstable molecules are key intermediates in many important reactions, but can be difficult to prepare for experimental studies. Species with missing (:CH-OH) or extra (H3) substituents can often be formed conveniently in the gas phase by neutralizing a beam of a more stable ionic counterpart (CH = O+H, H3+). Reionization of the neutral after approximately 10(-6) seconds tests its stability, whereas its unimolecular chemistry can be probed by preparing it with different amounts of internal energy. The resulting neutral products are reionized and mass analyzed. Isomers are then characterized by ion dissociation and a third mass-analysis step. Many unusual molecules have been characterized with this technique, which can also be used to probe complex unimolecular chemistry, such as that of cyclobutadiene and ethylene oxide."
https://openalex.org/W1986311952,"CELL nuclei are capable of partitioning a wide variety of molecules from the cytosol, including macromolecules such as proteins1–11 and RNA12–14, and smaller peptides9,14–16, amino acids17, sugars18,19 and Na+and K+ ions20,21, all of which can be accumulated in or excluded from the nuclear domain. There are two mechanisms behind this compartmentalization: selective retention of freely diffusible molecules, and selective entry through the nuclear envelope. It is generally accepted that the nuclear envelope restricts only the larger molecules22–24. Here we apply the patch-clamp technique to isolated murine pronuclei25 and show that the nuclear envelope contains K+-selective channels which have multiple conductance states, the maximal conductance being 200 pS. These channels, which contribute to the nuclear membrane potential26, may be important in balancing the charge carried by the movement of macromolecules in and out of the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2023290813,"In view of the current interest in in vivo murine models for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the interaction between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-related retroviruses was investigated with a human leukemic T cell line (PF-382x) that acquired xenotropic MuLV (X-MuLV) after in vivo passage in immunosuppressed mice. Despite similar levels of membrane CD4 expression and HIV-1 125I-labeled gp120 binding, a dramatic acceleration in the time course of HIV-1 infection was observed in PF-382x compared to its X-MuLV-negative counterpart (PF-382). Moreover, PF-382 cells coinfected by X-MuLV and HIV-1 generated a progeny of phenotypically mixed viral particles, enabling HIV-1 to productively infect a panel of CD4- human cells, including B lymphoid cells and purified normal peripheral blood CD4-/CD8+ T lymphocytes. Mixed viral phenotypes were also produced by human CD4+ T cells coinfected with an amphotropic MuLV-related retrovirus (A-MuLV) and HIV-1. These data show that endogenous MuLV acquired by human cells transplanted into mice can significantly interact with HIV-1, thereby inducing important alterations of HIV-1 biological properties."
https://openalex.org/W2060384825,"Bacterial MerR proteins are dimeric DNA-binding proteins that mediate the Hg(II)-dependent induction of mercury resistance operons. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Bacillus sp. RC607 MerR protein reveals that three of four Cys residues per monomer are required for Hg(II) binding at the single high-affinity binding site. Inactive mutant homodimers can exchange subunits to form heterodimers active for Hg(II) binding. Studies of a heterodimer retaining only three of eight cysteine residues per dimer reveal that Cys79 in one subunit and Cys114 and Cys123 in the second subunit are necessary and sufficient for high-affinity Hg(II) binding in an asymmetric, subunit bridging coordination complex."
https://openalex.org/W2399311038,"Recent studies suggest that signal-dependent formation of phosphatidic acid by phospholipase D-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine is a novel trans-membrane signaling pathway in mammalian cells. We here demonstrate that sphingosine, as well as some other long chain bases, activates phospholipase D in neural-derived NG108-15 cells. Sphingosine potently stimulated phosphatidic acid and, in the presence of ethanol, phosphatidylethanol formation. (Phosphatidylethanol is a nonphysiological phospholipid which is characteristically produced by phospholipase D in the presence of ethanol.) Elevated phosphatidic acid levels were accompanied by increased phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol production and a decrease in diacylglycerol levels. Sphingosine stimulated phospholipase D activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. A long aliphatic chain and a free 2-amino group were important structural requirements for the activation of phospholipase D by sphingosine-related molecules. We propose that phospholipase D may constitute an important cellular target for sphingosine action under both physiological and pathological circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W1493730509,"Anti-human platelet p24/CD9 (p24/monoclonal antibody 7) causes the activation of platelets and in the presence of calcium induces platelet aggregation. Our studies suggest that platelet response to this antibody is mediated at least in part by the pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) that stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and inhibit adenylate cyclase. Prior exposure of saponin-treated platelets to anti-p24/CD9 inhibited the [32P] ADP-ribosylation of the alpha 41 protein by pertussis toxin. Platelet aggregation induced by this antibody is preceded by and/or accompanied by accelerated phosphatidylinositol turnover, the generation of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol (DAG), calcium mobilization, and protein phosphorylation. The production of inositol phosphate(s) was measurable within 15 s of either anti-p24/CD9 or thrombin addition. Within 10 s of antibody addition (10 micrograms/ml), the level of DAG was 200% over that of the control and similar to that observed with 2 units/ml thrombin (201% over that of the control). Therefore, as it appears to be true for thrombin, platelet response upon binding of anti-p24/CD9 is primarily mediated by the activation of phospholipase C. When platelets pretreated with aspirin (200 microM) and apyrase (1 mg/ml) were subsequently exposed to anti-p24/CD9, aggregation still occurred. This indicates that neither secreted ADP nor thromboxane generation is required for this aggregation response. Using indo-1 and ratio cytofluorometry, we observed that an increase in platelet cytosolic calcium is a relatively early event and occurs in either the presence or absence of calcium in the external media. Phosphorylation studies of platelet proteins showed that anti-p24/CD9 binding to platelets caused increased phosphorylation of four proteins with apparent molecular masses of 50,000, 47,000, 36,000, and 20,000 daltons. These studies suggest that platelet activation mediated by the surface protein p24/CD9 is mainly through the stimulation of a phospholipase C, the activation of which is responsible for the generation of second messengers inositol trisphosphate and DAG."
https://openalex.org/W2090411826,"The earliest hominid from South Africa, Australopithecus africanus, is known from only six specimens in which accurate assessment of endocranial capacity and cranial venous outflow pattern can be obtained. This places a severe limit on a number of hypotheses concerning early hominid evolution, particularly those involving brain-body size relationships and adaptations of the circulatory system to evolving upright posture. Advances in high-resolution two- and three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) now allow the inclusion of another important specimen to this list, MLD 37/38 from Makapansgat. A new computer imaging technique is described that ""reconstructs"" the missing portions of the endocranial cavity in order to determine endocranial capacity. In addition, CT evaluation allows assessment of cranial venous outflow pattern even in cases where the endocranial cavity is completely filled with stone matrix. Results show that endocranial capacity in this specimen is less than originally proposed and also support the view that gracile and robust australopithecines evolved different cranial venous outflow patterns in response to upright postures."

https://openalex.org/W1480612082,"Rat liver nuclei protein kinase C is identified as type II isozyme employing monospecific antibodies obtained against each three types of rat brain protein kinase C isozymes. (Yoshida, Y., Huang, F. L., Nakabayashi, H., and Huang, K-P. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9868-9873). A major immunoreactive protein band at 80 kDa was revealed by type II isozyme antibodies at each step of purification, nuclear extract included. The nuclear protein kinase C has been purified to apparent homogeneity as revealed by silver nitrate staining on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showing a single 80 kDa protein band. It does seem that 66 kDa protein (Masmoudi, A., Labourdette, G., Mersel, M., Huang, F. L., Huang, K.-P., Vincendon, G., and Malviya, A. N. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1172-1179) is a major contaminant devoid of any protein kinase activity. The ratio obtained between protein kinase C enzymatic activity over phorbol dibutyrate bound, at various purification steps, indicates that the nuclear enzyme is a phorbol ester receptor. When isolated nuclei were incubated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, endogenous protein kinase C activity was elevated about 8-10-fold suggesting the existence of phorbol ester signaling pathway at the level of nucleus. The role of nuclear protein kinase C is delineated in the regulation of inducible gene transcription"
https://openalex.org/W1969343737,"Polymorphic forms of acetylcholinesterase are tethered extracellularly either as dimers membrane-anchored by a glycophospholipid or as catalytic subunits disulfidelinked to a collagen tail that associates with the basal lamina. Genomic clones of acetylcholinesterase from T. californica revealed that individual enzyme forms are encoded within a single gene that yields multiple mRNAs. Each enzyme form is encoded in three exons: the first two exons, bases -22 to 1502 and 1503 to 1669, encode sequence common to both forms, while alternative third exons encode a hydrophobic C-terminal region, to which a glycophospholipid is added upon processing, and a nonprocessed C-terminus, yielding a catalytic subunit that disulfide-links with a collagen-like structural unit. The 3′ untranslated region of each alternative exon contains tandem repeat sequences that are inverted with respect to the other exon. This may either dictate alternative exon usage by formation of cis stemloops or affect the abundance of translatable mRNA by trans-hybridization between the alternative spliced mRNA species."
https://openalex.org/W2048809179,"An intriguing question regarding neuronal development is how neurons choose which neurotransmitter and/or peptide to express among over 40 candidates. We find that heart cell conditioned medium (CM) induces a number of neuropeptides and/or their precursor mRNAs, as well as acetylcholine, in cultured rat sympathetic neurons: substance P, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, enkephalin derivatives, and cholecystokinin, but not neuropeptide Y. Different patterns of peptide induction were observed for CMs from primary cultures of heart, gut, and skin. Acetylcholine and substance P were induced most effectively by serum-free heart cell CM; enkephalin derivatives were induced most effectively by skin cell CM; and somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide were induced equally well by all of the CMs. These observations suggest the possibility that many distinct, diffusible factors can influence the choice of transmitter and/or peptide phenotype in developing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1490730015,"We have studied with Mossbauer spectroscopy the metal clusters of CO dehydrogenase from Clostridium thermoaceticum. At potentials greater than -200 mV, all of the approximately 12 irons reside in diamagnetic environments and contribute a quadrupole doublet characteristic of [Fe4S4]2+ clusters. At lower potentials a variety of components are observed. About 40% of the Fe appears to belong to one [Fe4S4]1+ cluster. We have also observed the Mossbauer spectrum (approximately 18% of Fe) of the complex which yields EPR with g = 2.01, 1.81, and 1.65. Also present is a doublet (9% of Fe) with delta EQ = 2.90 mm/s and delta = 0.70 mm/s, values typical of a ferrous FeS4 complex. This component seems to interact with a nickel site to form an EPR-silent complex with half-integral electronic spin. We have also characterized the iron environments of the S = 1/2 NiFeC complex. This complex contributes approximately 20% of the total Mossbauer absorption when the EPR signal has approximately 0.35 spins/12 Fe. From isomer shift comparisons in the oxidized and CO-reacted states of this center, we speculate that the NiFeC complex may consist of a nickel site exchange-coupled to a [Fe4S4]2+ cluster. Finally, the Mossbauer and EPR data, taken together, force us to conclude that current preparations, while homogeneous according to purifications standards, are spectroscopically heterogeneous, thus rendering the development of a model of the cluster types and compositions in this enzyme premature."
https://openalex.org/W2019630675,"A founder transgenic mouse harbored two different integration patterns of a transgene at the same locus, each of which gave rise to a similar autosomal recessive mutation. Mice of the mutant phenotype were of small stature but had normal levels of growth hormone. The disrupted locus was cloned, and a genetic and molecular analysis showed that the insertional mutants were allelic to a spontaneous mutant, pygmy. The mice should be a useful model for the growth hormone-resistant human dwarf syndromes and could lead to a greater understanding of the pathways involved in growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W1556735704,"Previously, it has been shown that laminin will self-assemble by a two-step calcium-dependent process using end-domain interactions (Yurchenco, P. D., Tsi-library, E. C., Charonis, A. S., and Furthmayr, H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7636-7644). We now find that heparin, at low concentrations, modifies this polymerization by driving the equilibrium further toward aggregation, by producing a denser polymer, and by inducing aggregation in the absence of calcium. This effect on self-assembly is specific in that it is observed with heparin but not with several heparan sulfates or other glycosaminoglycans: it correlates with affinity and depends on the degree of polysaccharide sulfation. Heparin binds to laminin in a calcium-dependent manner with a single class of interaction (KD = 118 +/- 18 nM) and with a binding capacity of one heparin for two laminins. We find the long arm globule (E3) is the only laminin domain which exhibits substantial heparin binding: heparin binds E3 with an affinity (KD = 94 +/- 12 nM) and calcium dependence similar to that for intact laminin. These data strongly suggest that heparin modifies laminin assembly by binding to pairs of long arm globular domains. As a result the polymer may be stabilized at domain E3 and laminin interdomain interactions induced or modified. We further postulate that heparins may act in vivo as specific regulators of the structure and functions of basement membranes by both altering the laminin matrix and by displacing weakly binding heparan sulfates."
https://openalex.org/W1531274649,"The amine transporter from bovine chromaffin granules has been purified in a functional state. Two isoforms with different pI values have been separated and shown to be active. One with an unusually acidic pI (approximately 3.5) has been shown to be a glycoprotein with an apparent Mr of 80,000. The purified polypeptide catalyzes transport of serotonin upon reconstitution with an apparent Km of 2 microM and a Vmax of 140 nmol/mg/min, 150-200-fold higher than the one determined in the native system. Transport is inhibited by reserpine and tetrabenazine, ligands which bind to two distinct sites on the transporter. These findings suggest that the binding sites for both drugs reside on a single polypeptide. The reconstituted purified transporter binds [3H]reserpine with a biphasic kinetic behavior, KD values of 0.3 and 30 nM and Bmax of 310 and 4200 pmol/mg protein, respectively. In addition, binding of [3H]reserpine is accelerated upon imposition of a pH gradient across the proteoliposome. From these findings it is evident that a single polypeptide catalyzes the various functions of the transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1586774152,"The formation of delta-aminolevulinic acid, the first committed precursor in porphyrin biosynthesis, occurs in certain bacteria and in the chloroplasts of plants and algae in a three-step, tRNA-dependent transformation of glutamate. Glutamyl-tRNA reductase, the second enzyme of this pathway, reduces the activated carboxyl group of glutamyl-tRNA (Glu-tRNA) in the presence of NADPH and releases glutamate 1-semialdehyde (GSA). We have purified Glu-tRNA reductase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by employing six different chromatographic separations. The apparent molecular mass of the protein when analyzed under both denaturing (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and nondenaturing conditions (rate zonal sedimentation on glycerol gradients) was 130,000 Da; this indicates that the active enzyme is a monomer. In the presence of NADPH Glu-tRNA reductase catalyzed the reduction to GSA of glutamate acylated to the homologous tRNA. Thus, the reductase alone is sufficient for conversion of Glu-tRNA to GSA. In the absence of NADPH, a stable complex of Glu-tRNA reductase with Glu-tRNA can be isolated."
https://openalex.org/W1600103202,"Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in intact peroxisomes were compared with wild type cells for the presence of the nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsL-TP; sterol carrier protein 2). With the immunoblotting technique using the affinity purified antibody against rat liver nsL-TP, this protein was shown to be present in the homogenates from wild type cells, but could not be detected in mutant cells. In agreement with a previous study using livers from Zellweger patients it appears that there is a positive, as yet unknown, correlation between peroxisomes and the occurrence of nsL-TP in the cell. As a control using the affinity-purified antibody against the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein from bovine brain, levels of this protein were found to be normal in mutant cells. By use of metrizamide density gradients, nsL-TP was shown to cosediment with a membrane fraction different from peroxisomes. A protein of 58,000 daltons cross-reactive with the antibody against nsL-TP did cosediment with the peroxisomes in wild type cells and possibly with a peroxisomal remnant in the mutant cells. Incubation of wild type and mutant cells with L-[3-14C]serine showed that the biosynthesis of phosphatidylserine and the subsequent conversion into phosphatidylethanolamine was comparable in both cell types. This indicates that nsL-TP is not involved in the translocation of phosphatidylserine from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria as the site of decarboxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1575265914,"The structure of the 42-kilobase (kb) long chicken progesterone receptor (cPR) gene and of all six transcripts that are detectable on Northern blots was determined. The first of 8 exons encodes the N-terminal region A/B which is highly divergent among different species and contains a constitutive transcription activation function. The DNA (DBD)- and hormone-binding domains (HBD) are assembled from 2 and 5 exons, respectively, with the individual zinc fingers of the DBD encoded by separate exons. In addition to the previously described 4.5-kb cPR mRNA species, alternative polyadenylation, splicing variation, and lead to the generation of 5 further mRNAs. Most importantly, this 5'-truncation produces, by an as yet unidentified mechanism, an abundant transcript which encodes form A but not form B of cPR. Lack of splicing at the exon 2 splice-donor and polyadenylation due to a signal site in the second intron generates a previously undetected 3.4-kb mRNA species. The corresponding cDNA was sequenced in its entirety and shown to encode only region A/B and the N-terminal finger of the DBD. Alternative polyadenylation upstream of the signal site for the 4.5-kb mRNA is responsible for the appearance of a 3.3-kb mRNA. The longest cPR mRNA (8.2 kb) originates from a transcription termination point more than 3 kb downstream of the 4.5-kb mRNA 3'-end. Finally, the primary sequence of more than 2 kb upstream sequences of the cPR gene, containing several consensus hexamer progestin/glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites (PRE/GRE and putative Sp1 binding motifs, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1556738652,"Two cDNA clones corresponding to human microsomal dipeptidase (MDP, formerly referred to as dehydropeptidase-I or renal dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11] were isolated from human placental and renal cDNA libraries employing rapid amplification of cDNA ends strategy. The complete amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNAs contains 411 residues, beginning with a signal peptide of 16 residues. A highly hydrophobic sequence of 16 amino acids is located at the carboxyl terminus, supporting the previous observation which suggested that mature MDP is anchored to the membrane by covalently attached phosphatidylinositol. MDP has four potential N-glycosylation sites and has no apparent sequence similarity to other metallopeptidases. Expression of immunologically cross-reactive and enzymatically active MDP was attained in COS cells transfected with the cDNA.

https://openalex.org/W1607025664,"The protease inhibitor alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, which binds to chymotrypsin-like enzymes in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant manner, has been shown recently to be both a normal constituent of brain and an integral component of the neuritic plaques that form in Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. We have now identified in rat brain a Mr 25,000 alpha-1-antichymotrypsin-binding protein classified as a chymotrypsin-like protease by its inhibitor profile and substrate specificity. Release of 125I-labeled breakdown products from bands containing the protease in substrate-linked polyacrylamide gels was examined in parallel with hydrolysis of tetrapeptide chromogenic substrates in vitro to establish conditions under which the Mr 25,000 protease was the only activity being measured in vitro. The protease was completely membrane associated but was extractable using 1 M MgCl2; prior extraction of detergent- and low ionic strength-soluble proteins from membranes was used to increase its specific activity. The formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant bonds between human alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and the protease (kassoc = 2.9 X 10(6) M-1 s-1) was used to titrate the concentration of free protease solubilized from membranes. The protease cleaved both succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, and methoxy-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Met-p-nitroanilide, the latter being of interest because cleavage after a methionine residue is predicted to generate the amino terminus of the neuritic plaque component beta-amyloid from its precursor protein. In fact, the solubilized protease degraded 90% of membrane-associated beta-amyloid precursor protein detected by Western blot analysis. The protease was kinetically distinct from both chymotrypsin and cathepsin G in direct comparisons and did not match kinetic values published for the rat mast cell proteases against comparable substrates; we therefore refer to the protease with the descriptive acronym clipsin (for chymotrypsin-like protease). Proteases similar to and potentially identical to clipsin were detected by enzymography in other organs from rat (most notably spleen and adult lung). The enzyme in brain was distinguished by a narrow window of elevated activity surrounding postnatal day 5, which was 12-14-fold higher than levels in day 1 or adult brain. Because independent lines of evidence suggest that a brain chymotrypsin-like protease may be involved in the etiology of Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, clipsin is discussed as a candidate for such a role."
https://openalex.org/W1517287214,"Extension of synthetic primers by purified human polymerase alpha (Hpol alpha) with the (+)-strand of M13mp18 DNA as template encounters numerous specific pause sites on the M13 template. Some of these are regions of template secondary structure, at others the template codes for incorporation of the same base in multiple consecutive positions, but at some the responsible feature in the sequence is not obvious. 2-Chloro-dATP (CldATP) substitutes efficiently for dATP in such chain extension, with 2-chloroadenine (ClA) incorporation into many positions coding for A. However, there are more sites where extension is interrupted than with all four normal nucleotide substrates, particularly (but not exclusively) at template secondary structure and sites of multiple consecutive ClA insertion. DNA synthesis from normal substrates by Hpol beta in this system shows less frequent and less marked pauses, but with CldATP substituted for dATP chain extension is limited because of marked slowing of extension at sites of multiple consecutive ClA insertion. With either polymerase, the rate of extension is decreased even more at such regions when bromo-dATP is used as substrate. Some misincorporation of ClA instead of G or T can occur at certain sites in absence of the corresponding normal substrate, but misincorporation as C is rare. CldATP is a very weak inhibitor of chain extension by Hpol alpha, but a somewhat better inhibitor of Hpol beta. These results may account in part for the inhibition of DNA synthesis in cells exposed to 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine or 2-bromodeoxyadenosine."
https://openalex.org/W1551563170,"The temporal relationship of changes in state 3 respiration, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione (GSH) content was investigated in liver mitochondria of hypophysectomized rats after an injection of 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). Lipid peroxidation induced by ADP/Fe3+/NADPH was determined by the amount of malondialdehyde formed. Hypophysectomy decreased respiration and lipid peroxidation (from 19.88 +/- 3.04 to 14.19 +/- 1.14 nmol malondialdehyde.mg protein-1.10 min-1) but increased GSH content (from 7.06 +/- 2.08 to 12.46 +/- 3.58 nmol/mg protein). Daily injections of a low dose (5 micrograms/100 g) of T3 for 7 days restored the parameters. Time course (up to 96 h) of these changes was followed after one injection of a moderate (100 micrograms/100 g) and high (1000 micrograms/100 g) dose of the hormone. Respiration showed a significant increase at 24 h and declined slightly at 96 h. There was a slow loss of respiratory control ratio after 24 h. Lipid peroxidation remained unchanged at 24 h and showed a gradual increase, becoming significantly higher at 72-96 h depending on the hormone dosage. Changes in GSH content followed a time course similar to that of lipid peroxidation except that it showed a decrease instead of an increase. There was a high degree of inverse linear correlation between lipid peroxidation and GSH (correlation coefficient = 0.95). Because GSH is required for detoxification of hydroperoxides generated by the respiratory chain, it is suggested that lipid peroxidation may play a major role in the modulation of intramitochondrial GSH."
https://openalex.org/W116004773,"The effect of salts on the catalytic activity of the molybdenum-containing nitrogenase complex from Azotobacter vinelandii has been investigated. NaCl was found to inhibit the reduction of the substrates, protons, acetylene, and dinitrogen by a common mechanism. The pattern of inhibition is sigmoidal, indicating a highly cooperative interaction involving multiple inhibitor sites. Sixteen other salts that were investigated also exhibited this pattern of inhibition. NaCl functions as a dead-end inhibitor without altering the number of MgATP hydrolyzed/electron transferred to substrate. The level of expressed inhibition is sensitive to MgATP concentration, the molar ratio of the MoFe-protein (Av1) to the Fe-protein (Av2), and total protein concentration. In addition, NaCl is an inhibitor of the MgATP-dependent, iron chelation of Av2. Although the inhibition is exhibited over the same salt concentration range as that for inhibition of substrate reduction, the pattern of inhibition is hyperbolic. A model based upon simple equilibrium interactions among the enzyme species, nucleotides, and inhibitor has been developed which quantitatively accounts for the observed effects of salt. In this model, the formation of the active complex between Av1 and Av2 is abolished by salts. Likewise, the apparent affinity of Av2 for MgATP is reduced. An additional prediction based upon the model is that the affinity between Av2 and Av1 is independent of nucleotide binding."
https://openalex.org/W1509939418,"The effects of the acidotropic agent, NH4Cl, on the recycling and turnover of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors were analyzed in human skin fibroblasts using ligand binding assays, [35S]methionine pulse-chase experiments, and electron microscopy. NH4Cl did not prevent receptor internalization but caused a marked redistribution of LDL receptors to intracellular sites (endosomes) that was completely dependent on the presence of apolipoprotein-B- or -E-containing ligands. Maximal inhibition of recycling was observed at LDL concentrations that only partially saturated receptors, suggesting that the receptors function as oligomers. In contrast, full receptor occupancy by the multivalent, apolipoprotein-E-containing beta-very low density lipoprotein was required for the same effect. The intracellular accumulation was reversible and the majority of receptors returned to the cell surface when NH4Cl was removed after short treatments. The rate of degradation of LDL receptors was greatly accelerated in the presence of NH4Cl and ligand, with a t1/2 of about 2 h (approximately 6 times faster than receptor degradation in the absence of NH4Cl). Neither the redistribution nor the accelerated loss of immunoprecipitable LDL receptors was observed in an LDL receptor internalization-defective mutant cell line. We conclude that NH4Cl inhibited the recycling specifically of occupied receptors, thereby accelerating their degradation, probably in endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1530800973,"Three novel pteridines have been isolated from the urine of patients with a new variant of 6-(L-erythro-1',2'-dihydroxypropyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (tetrahydrobiopterin) deficiency, showing hyperphenylalaninemia. From the results of high performance liquid chromatography, oxidative degradation, and gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry, their structures were identified as 7-(D-erythro-1',2',3'-trihydroxypropyl)-pterin (7-neopterin), 7-(L-erythro-1',2'-dihydroxypropyl)-pterin (7-biopterin), and 6-oxo-7-(L-erythro-1',2'-dihydroxypropyl)-pterin (6-oxo-7-biopterin). The ratio of biopterin to 7-biopterin in the patients' urines was 1:1, and after oral loading with tetrahydrobiopterin, 7-biopterin excretion rose parallel to biopterin. This finding suggests that 7-substituted pterins may be formed endogenously by a yet unknown isomerization reaction. The cause of hyperphenylalaninemia is still unclear. The activities of the enzymes involved in tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis and regeneration were found to be normal in the patients, and no effect of 7-biopterin on these enzymes was observed in vitro. However, compared with the normal cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin, the Km values of tetrahydro-7-biopterin for phenylalanine hydroxylase and dihydropteridine reductase are 20 and 5 times higher, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1586893734,"Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was purified by sequential column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, Mono Q, and Mono S. The apparent molecular mass of the protein when analyzed under both denaturing conditions (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and nondenaturing conditions (rate zonal sedimentation on glycerol gradients) was 62,000 Da; this indicates that the active enzyme is a monomer. The purified glutamyl-tRNA synthetase was identified as the chloroplast enzyme by its tRNA charging specificity. Reversed-phase chromatography of unfractionated C. reinhardtii tRNA resolved four peaks of glutamate acceptor RNA when assayed with the purified enzyme. The enzyme can also glutamylate Escherichia coli tRNA(2Glu), but not cytoplasmic tRNA(Glu) from yeast or barley. In addition, the enzyme misacylates chloroplast tRNA(Gln) with glutamate. A similar mischarging phenomenon has been demonstrated for the barley chloroplast enzyme (Schon, A., Kannangara, C.G., Gough, S., and Soll, D. (1988) Nature 331, 187-190) and for Bacillus subtilis glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (Proulx, M., Duplain, L., Lacoste, L., Yaguchi, M., and Lapointe, J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 753-759)."
https://openalex.org/W1585825359,"Fractal geometries have been widely observed in nature. The formulation of mathematical treatments of non-Euclidean geometry has generated models of highly complex natural phenomena. In the field of developmental biology, branching morphogenesis has been explained in terms of self-similar iterating branching rules that have done much toward explaining branch patterns observed in a range of real tissue. In solid viscera the problem is more complicated because there is no readily available marker of geometry in parenchymal tissue. Mosaic pattern provides such a marker. The patches observed in mosaic liver are shown to be fractal, indicating that the pattern may have arisen from a self-similar process (i.e., a process that creates an object in which small areas are representative of, although not necessarily identical to, the whole object). This observation offers a new analytical approach to the study of biologic structure in organogenesis.— Iannaccone, P. M. Fractal geometry in mosaic organs: a new interpretation of mosaic pattern.

https://openalex.org/W1539269718,"Microtubules are capable of performing synchronized oscillations of assembly and disassembly which has been explained by reaction mechanisms involving tubulin subunits, oligomers, microtubules, and GTP. Here we address the question of how microtubule nucleation or their number concentration affects the oscillations. Assembly itself requires a critical protein concentration (Cc), but oscillations require in addition a critical microtubule number concentration (CMT). In spontaneous assembly this can be achieved with protein concentrations Cos well above the critical concentration Cc because this enhances the efficiency of nucleation. Seeding with microtubules can either generate oscillations or suppress them, depending on how the seeds alter the effective microtubule number concentration. The relative influence of microtubule number and total protein concentrations can be varied by the rate at which assembly conditions are induced (e.g. by a temperature rise): Fast T-jumps induce oscillations because of efficient nucleation, slow ones do not. Oscillations become damped for several reasons. One is the consumption of GTP, the second is a decrease in microtubule number, and the third is that the ratio of microtubules in the two phases (growth-competent and shrinkage-competent) approach a steady state value. This ratio can be perturbed, and the oscillations restarted, by a cold shock, addition of seeds, addition of GTP, or fragmentation. Each of these is equivalent to a change in the effective microtubule number concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1500619079,"Flavin-dependent external monooxygenases and oxidases could catalyze the same flavin oxidation reaction involving distinct mechanisms. To gain insights into enzyme structure-function relationship, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out for Vibrio harveyi luciferase, a monooxygenase. The substitution of the alpha subunit cysteine 106 by alanine shows unambiguously that the alphaCys106 is not essential to catalysis. The corresponding substitution by valine resulted in a substantial reduction of the bioluminescence activity correlatable with the induction of a new flavin oxidation activity typical for oxidases. These findings indicate that mutation of a single noncatalytic residue at the active center of a flavoenzyme could transform one enzyme type to another, thus highlighting the subtlety of enzyme active site structure in relation to catalysis and the versatility of enzyme evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1514411768,"The proteins contacting nascent RNA transcripts in RNA polymerase III transcription complexes have been examined using photoaffinity labeling techniques. The photoaffinity analog 4-S-UTP was incorporated along with [alpha-32P]CTP into VAI transcripts, using a phosphocellulose fractionated HeLa S-100 extract and DNA containing the adenovirus VAI gene. The photoreactive nascent RNA was cross-linked to proximal proteins in the transcription complex. The photoaffinity labeled proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. The specific photoaffinity labeling of RNA polymerase III was dependent on 4-S-UTP and on DNA containing a class III promoter. Photoaffinity labeling was inhibited by 200 micrograms/ml alpha-amanitin. Proteins of 140, 160, 270, and 310 kDa were labeled. These photoaffinity labeled proteins were shown to be stably associated with the DNA template by gel exclusion chromatography. The 160-kDa protein was cross-linked to RNAs approximately 14-18 nucleotides in length, whereas the greater than 250-kDa proteins were cross-linked to RNAs 18-30 nucleotides in length. The 140- and 160-kDa proteins correspond in molecular mass to the two large subunits of RNA polymerase III. The molecular masses of the 270- and 310-kDa proteins, and the length of the RNA cross-linked to them, suggest that these proteins are components of transcription factor (TF) IIIC. These results indicate that the nascent transcript contacts the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase III until the transcription complex reaches the TFIIIC binding site, at which point the nascent transcript contacts TFIIIC."
https://openalex.org/W1605628926,"MOLT-4 lymphocytes metabolize 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) via beta-oxidation with retention of the hydroxyl group at the omega 6-carbon atom. 15-HETE oxidation is accompanied by the time-dependent accumulation of both beta-hydroxy acids and metabolites produced by repetitive cycles of the beta-oxidation spiral. Detection of 7-hydroxy-5-dodecenoic acid shows that these cells continue to beta-oxidize the substrate when the conjugated diene is allylic to a hydroxyl group. When 15-HETE was the substrate, it was also possible to detect 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrien-1-al and 3,15-dihydroxy-8,11,13-eicosatrienoic acid. The former product may be produced by alpha-oxidation of 13-hydroxy-6,9,11-octadecatrienoic acid followed by its decarboxylation. Detection of a 20-carbon metabolite, lacking a double bond at position 5, suggests that an intermediate of beta-oxidation was used as a substrate for chain elongation. When 13-hydroxy-6,9,11-octadecatrienoic acid was used as a substrate, it was indeed possible to detect 3,15-dihydroxy-8,11,13-eicosatrienoic acid as well as 15-hydroxy-8,11,13-eicosatrienoic acid. In addition, 13-hydroxy-6,9,11-octadecatrienoic acid was a precursor for the biosynthesis of both 14-hydroxy-7,10,12-nonadecatrien-1-al and 1,14-dihydroxy-7,10,12-nonadecatriene. These studies with MOLT-4 cells as well as with T-lymphocytes isolated from blood show that products of the 15-lipoxygenase pathway are metabolized with the accumulation of a variety of compounds. Since 15-HETE has been implicated as a modulator of T-cell function, these findings raise the possibility that the newly described metabolites may be involved in regulating lymphocyte function."
https://openalex.org/W197385798,"Two forms of porcine histone acetyltransferase (types I and II) have been purified to apparent homogeneity from liver nuclei. Both activities are extracted from nuclei by 0.5 M NaCl and display a native Mr of 110,000 as determined by gel filtration. Saline enzyme extracts were subject to ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential chromatography on Q-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-200, hydroxylapatite, and Mono Q supports. The histone acetyltransferase type I fraction contains three polypeptide chains with apparent Mr values of 105,000, 62,000, and 45,000, respectively, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cyanogen bromide peptide mapping and immunoblotting suggest that the Mr 62,000 and 45,000 polypeptides are derived by cleavage of the Mr 105,000 polypeptide. Histone acetyltransferase type II contains two different subunits with apparent Mr values of 50,000 and 40,000, respectively. The amino acid composition, heat inactivation profiles, and Michaelis constants with respect to both acetyl coenzyme A and histones were indistinguishable for types I and II. However, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to both forms of the enzyme do not cross-react; cyanogen bromide-derived in situ cleavage digest patterns show few similarities; and the turnover number for type I is approximately 15-fold lower than that for type II. We estimate that there is one enzyme molecule for every 500 nucleosomes. The existence of two distinct forms of nuclear histone acetyltransferase in pig liver suggests that they may have separate functions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1546802890,"Radiation inactivation and sedimentation equilibrium analysis were used to determine the functional and physical size of the chicken hepatic membrane receptor that binds N-acetylglucosamine-terminated glycoproteins. Purified plasma membranes from chicken liver were irradiated with high energy electrons and assayed for 125I-agalactoorosomucoid binding. Increasing the dose of ionizing radiation resulted in a monoexponential decay in binding activity due to a progressive loss of binding sites. The molecular mass of the chicken lectin, determined in situ by target analysis, was 69,000 +/- 9,000 Da. When the same irradiated membranes were solubilized in Brij 58 and assayed, the binding protein exhibited a target size of 62,000 +/- 4,000 Da; in Triton X-100, the functional size of the receptor was 85,000 +/- 10,000 Da. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements of the purified binding protein yielded a lower limit molecular weight of 79,000 +/- 7,000. However, the solubilized lectin was detected as a heterogeneous population of oligomers with molecular weights as high as 450,000. Addition of calcium or calcium plus N-acetylglucosamine decreased the higher molecular weight species, but the lower limit molecular weights remained invariant. Similar results were determined when the chicken lectin was solubilized in Brij 58, C12E9, or 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonic acid (CHAPS). Results from the present study suggest that in the plasma membrane, the functional species of the chicken hepatic lectin exists as a trimer. However, in detergent solution, the purified receptor forms a heterogeneous population of irreversible oligomers that exhibit binding activity proportional to size."
