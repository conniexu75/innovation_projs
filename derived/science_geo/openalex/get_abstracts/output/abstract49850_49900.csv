https://openalex.org/W1591950279,"The hemagglutinin (HA) spike glycoprotein of influenza virus catalyzes a low pH-induced membrane fusion event which releases the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm. To study the fusion mechanism in more detail, we have prepared the ectodomain of HA in water-soluble form by treating virus particles with bromelain. Under mildly acidic conditions (pH less than or equal to 5.8), the ectodomain undergoes a conformational change which we found to be biochemically and immunologically equivalent to that in native viral HA. It became sensitive to proteinase K, it exposed new antigenic epitopes in its HA1 chain, and it acquired amphiphilic properties, notably the ability to bind to liposomes. The attachment to liposomes exhibited the same pH dependence and rapid kinetics as the conformational change and was mediated by HA2. The nature of the attachment resembled that of an integral membrane protein except that the bound HA was partially removed by base. As observed for virus fusion, attachment is independent of divalent cations and lipid composition. Temperature was found to be a critical parameter only with dimyristoylphosphatidycholine vesicles where attachment was partially blocked below the major phase transition. These and other results obtained indicated that the low pH-induced conformational change in the isolated ectodomain is equivalent to that occurring in intact viral HA, and that its attachment to liposomes can serve as a model for the initial stages in the HA-induced membrane fusion reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1554532255,"Protein 4.1 from human erythrocytes formed a complex with band 3 in inside-out erythrocyte membrane vesicles and with soluble peptides derived from the cytoplasmic domain of band 3. Protein 4.1 labeled metabolically with 32P bound saturably to vesicles depleted of endogenous protein 4.1. The soluble cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (43K) competitively displaced approximately 60% of bound 32P-protein 4.1 from reconstituted membrane vesicles. Pretreatment of vesicles with anti-43K similarly inhibited the rebinding of protein 4.1. In solution, 125I-43K formed a complex with protein 4.1 that saturated at 1:1 stoichiometry and migrated as a discrete band when analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In rate-zonal sedimentation in isotonic salt solutions, protein 4.1 and 43K sedimented as a sharp peak at 4.4 S. In experiments aimed at exploring the role of the protein 4.1-band 3 interaction in the organization of the membrane skeleton, the effect of spectrin was investigated. Spectrin and protein 4.1 formed a complex which co-sedimented in sucrose gradients, but the addition of 43K to preformed spectrin-protein 4.1 complexes resulted in disruption of the complex and co-sedimentation of most of the protein 4.1 with 43K. These results suggest that protein 4.1 can associate with band 3 in the erythrocyte membrane and that this association may modulate the attachment of the membrane skeleton to the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1544106935,"The NMR technique of magnetization transfer can be used to define intracellular reaction kinetics. In order to determine the relationship between ATP synthesis and flux through the creatine kinase reaction in the intact heart, we used this technique to measure flux through the creatine kinase reaction in the isolated, isovolumic rat heart at five levels of cardiac performance and oxygen consumption. The unidirectional reaction rate constants (s-1) calculated from a two-site exchange model for both the forward and reverse creatine kinase reactions increased with cardiac performance and oxygen consumption. As the rate-pressure product varied from 0 to 44.7 X 10(3) mm Hg/min and oxygen consumption rose from 5.9 to 45.8 mumol of O2/g dry weight/min, kforward increased from 0.27 to 1.30 and kreverse increased from 0.31 to 1.14. The relationship between creatine kinase flux and oxygen consumption, and thus ATP synthesis, took the form of the Michaelis-Menten equation. Rates of ATP synthesis estimated from magnetization transfer were similar to values calculated from oxygen consumption. The longitudinal relaxation time of creatine phosphate (2.06 s), the gamma-phosphorus atom of ATP (0.75 s), and inorganic phosphate (0.81 s) did not change with cardiac performance. These results show that myocardial energy transfer via the creatine kinase reaction is closely coupled to energy production."
https://openalex.org/W1537146606,"Thyrotropin (TSH), a pituitary glycoprotein, consists of two subunits (alpha and beta), and regulates thyroid hormone production by the thyroid gland. The thyroid hormones, in turn, feedback negatively on TSH production. We have investigated the effect of triiodothyronine (T3) on the transcription of the TSH subunit genes. Hypothyroid LAF1 mice bearing TtT 97 thyrotropic tumors were injected daily with T3 (5 micrograms/100 g of body weight, intraperitoneal) and killed after 0, 0.5, 1, 4, or 120 h. Nuclei were isolated from the tumors and allowed to continue RNA synthesis in the presence of [alpha-32P]UTP. Newly synthesized mRNA sequences were quantitated by hybridization to immobilized cloned cDNA containing sequences specific for either alpha subunit or TSH-beta mRNA. Basal levels of mRNA synthesis were similar for alpha subunit and TSH-beta. After only 30 min of T3 treatment in vivo, mRNA synthesis was decreased for both alpha subunit (by 28%) and TSH-beta (by 61%). These decreases were maximum after 4 h, (75% for alpha subunit, greater than 95% for TSH-beta mRNA synthesis), and were maintained for the 5 days of T3 treatment. Decreases in mRNA synthesis precede decreases in tissue mRNA concentrations. Our studies suggest that T3 rapidly decreases the transcription of both the alpha subunit and TSH-beta genes, and that the transcription of the TSH-beta gene is affected to a greater extent than the alpha subunit gene."
https://openalex.org/W1578682930,"Labeling of the BC3H1 muscle cell line with [3H] palmitate and [3H]myristate results in the incorporation of these fatty acids into a broad spectrum of different proteins. The patterns of proteins which are labeled with palmitate and myristate are distinct, indicating a high degree of specificity of fatty acylation with respect to acyl chain length. The protein-linked [3H]palmitate is released by treatment with neutral hydroxylamine or by alkaline methanolysis consistent with a thioester linkage or a very reactive ester linkage. In contrast, only a small fraction of the [3H]myristate which is attached to proteins is released by treatment with hydroxylamine or alkaline methanolysis, suggesting that myristate is linked to proteins primarily through amide bonds. The specificity of fatty acid acylation has also been examined in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and in PC12 cells, a rat pheochromacytoma cell line. In both cells, palmitate is primarily linked to proteins by a hydroxylamine-labile linkage while the major fraction of the myristic acid (60-70%) is linked to protein via amide linkage and the remainder via an ester linkage. Major differences were noted in the rate of fatty acid metabolism in these cells; in particular in 3T3 cells only 33% of the radioactivity incorporated from myristic acid into proteins is in the form of fatty acids. The remainder is presumably the result of conversion of label to amino acids. In BC3H1 cells, palmitate- and myristate-containing proteins also exhibit differences in subcellular localization. [3H]Palmitate-labeled proteins are found almost exclusively in membranes, whereas [3H]myristate-labeled proteins are distributed in both the soluble and membrane fractions. These results demonstrate that fatty acid acylation is a covalent modification common to a wide range of cellular proteins and is not restricted solely to membrane-associated proteins. The major acylated proteins in the various cell lines examined appear to be different, suggesting that the acylated proteins are concerned with specialized cell functions. The linkages through which fatty acids are attached to proteins also appear to be highly specific with respect to the fatty acid chain length."
https://openalex.org/W1577183978,"The proteolytic maturation of cathepsin D polypeptides was studied in lysosomes isolated from metabolically labeled fibroblasts. In lysosomes isolated from fibroblasts labeled with [35S]methionine, 70-95% of labeled cathepsin D polypeptides were represented by a Mr = 47,000 polypeptide after a 20-min pulse and 75-min chase. When these lysosomes were incubated in vitro, up to 70% of the Mr = 47,000 polypeptide was processed to mature cathepsin D polypeptides. The processing was dependent on the integrity of the lysosomes, had an optimum between pH 6 and 7, and could be stimulated by dithiothreitol and ATP. The noncleavable ATP analogue, adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate, and GTP, CTP, and UTP could not substitute for ATP. The ATP-dependent stimulation was associated with an acidification of lysosomes. It was inhibited by agents that dissipate the lysosomal pH gradient (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, nigericin, NH4Cl). A stimulatory effect of ATP was observed also at pH 5.5. The stimulation at pH 5.5 was not associated with acidification of lysosomes and was resistant to protonophores. Inhibitors of lysosomal cysteine proteinases and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the processing. In the presence of ATP the processing activity was partially protected from inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide. In conclusion, the maturation of cathepsin D in lysosomes depends on cysteine proteinases and is stimulated by the ATP-driven acidification of lysosomes. In addition, ATP stimulates maturation at pH 5.5 by a mechanism not involving the proton pump."
https://openalex.org/W1507233443,"Treatment of rat heart mitochondria with phosphate or mersalyl releases a number of proteins, including the mitochondrial creatine kinase (mt-CK). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the released proteins showed that phosphate is more selective than mersalyl in releasing mt-CK. The rebinding of mt-CK to mitochondria was selectively inhibited by adriamycin, which complexes membrane-bound cardiolipin. mt-CK activity and binding experiments have shown that intact mitochondria are able to bind approximately twice the amount of mt-CK they originally contain. Liver mitochondria bound heart mitochondria mt-CK to the same extent as creatine kinase-depleted heart mitochondria. mt-CK was bound by liposomes but only if they contained cardiolipin. The binding of mt-CK to cardiolipin-containing liposomes was inhibited by adriamycin. Phosphatidylcholine liposomes reconstituted with the purified ADP/ATP translocator failed to bind mt-CK."
https://openalex.org/W1525417539,"Cytochromes P-450b and P-450e are extremely homologous and immunochemically indistinguishable proteins that are coordinately induced by phenobarbital in rat liver. To assess the effect of phenobarbital on mRNA levels for each of these hemoproteins we performed solution hybridization and Northern blot experiments with synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probes of defined sequence. Our data demonstrate that phenobarbital administration to rats resulted in marked increases in levels of hepatic mRNA for both cytochrome P-450b and cytochrome P-450e, with a 4- to 5-fold greater accumulation of P-450b mRNA vis a vis P-450e mRNA. The level of hepatic mRNA increased from less than 3 molecules/cell of each mRNA in untreated rats, to 630 and 130 molecules/cell for P-450b and P-450e, respectively, in phenobarbital-treated rats. Data obtained in Northern blot hybridization experiments demonstrated that the size of the mRNAs for each protein were identical, being approximately 1800 bases in length."
https://openalex.org/W1571201200,"The measurement of infrared spectra for cyanide liganded to hemeproteins and hemins has been investigated. The hemeproteins included human methemoglobin A, lamprey methemoglobin, metchlorocruorin, horse metmyoglobin, and horseradish peroxidase. The hemins were dicyanide and monopyridine monocyanide species of deuteroporphyrin IX iron(III) and its 2,4-divinyl(proto) and 2,4-diacetyl derivatives. C-N stretch bands of low intensity detected near 2100 cm-1 exhibit changes in frequency, width, intensity, and isotope shift with changes in cyanide compound structure. Infrared band parameters are particularly sensitive to a change in oxidation state (Fe2+ versus Fe3+) and are affected to a lesser extent by changes in porphyrin ring substituent, ligand trans to the cyanide, and protein structure. Evidence of multiple conformers (i.e. multiple C-N stretch bands) was found for several hemeproteins. The cyanide infrared spectra provide direct evidence for cyanide binding as a metal cyanide (Fe--C identical to N) and against HCN being the ligand in nitrile-like bonding (Fe--N identical to C--H) in all the hemeprotein and hemin cyanides studied. With the reduced horseradish peroxidase cyanide, differences between infrared spectra for D2O and H2O solutions can result from hydrogen bonding between a protein amino acid residue and the distal atom of the cyanide (Fe--C identical to N...H+--R). The binding of cyanide to reduced iron (Fe2+) of a hemeprotein was only observed in the case of the reduced peroxidase. These findings demonstrate that cyanide infrared spectra can not only determine when cyanide is bound to a metalloprotein but can also provide information on how the cyanide is bonded to metal and on characteristics of the ligand binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1489591743,"To characterize the system(s) responsible for degradation of short-lived and long-lived proteins in mammalian cells, we compared the concentrations of ATP required for the degradation of these classes of proteins in growing hamster fibroblasts. By treating CHEF-18 cells with increasing concentrations of dinitrophenol and 2-deoxyglucose, it was possible to reduce their steady-state ATP content by different amounts (up to 98%). These treatments caused a rapid decrease in the degradation of both short- and long-lived proteins. Removal of the inhibitors led to a prompt restoration of ATP and proteolysis. As ATP content fell below normal levels (about 3.1 mM), rates of proteolysis decreased in a graded biphasic fashion. Reduction in ATP by up to 90% (as may occur in anoxia or injury) decreased proteolysis up to 50%; and with further loss of ATP, protein breakdown fell more sharply. Degradation of both classes of proteins was inhibited by 80% when ATP levels were reduced by 98%. The levels of ATP required for the breakdown of short- and long-lived proteins were indistinguishable. Protein synthesis was much more sensitive to a decrease in ATP content than protein breakdown and fell by 50% when ATP was reduced by only 15%. Chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosome function, did not reduce the degradation of either class of proteins in growing cells, but it did inhibit the enhanced degradation of long-lived proteins upon removal of serum (in accord with previous studies). Thus, in growing fibroblasts, an ATP-dependent nonlysosomal process appears responsible for the hydrolysis of both short- and long-lived proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1529776597,"Production of hydrogen peroxide and secretion of myeloperoxidase by stimulated neutrophils resulted in myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of chloride to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the reaction of HOCl with taurine to yield taurine monochloramine (TauNHCl), and accumulation of TauNHCl in the extracellular medium. When erythrocytes were present, the yield of TauNHCl was lower as the result of uptake of TauNHCl into erythrocytes. The zwitterion taurine was not taken up, but the anion TauNHCl and other anionic oxidants including taurine dichloramine (TauNCl2) and L-alanine chloramines were transported into erythrocytes by the anion-transport system. Oxidation of intracellular components such as glutathione (GSH) by taurine chloramines resulted in reduction of the chloramines and trapping of taurine within erythrocytes. At high oxidant:erythrocyte ratios, TauNHCl also oxidized hemoglobin (Hb) and depleted ATP, but caused little lysis. TauNCl2 was much more effective as a lytic agent. At low oxidant:erythrocyte ratios, the chloramines caused net loss of GSH when no glucose was provided, but Hb was not oxidized and GSH content returned to normal when glucose was added. Therefore, anionic chloramines may mediate oxidative toxicity when the neutrophil:erythrocyte ratio is high. Under more physiologic conditions, chlorination of taurine by neutrophils and the uptake and reduction of TauNHCl by erythrocytes prevents accumulation of oxidants and may protect blood cells, plasma components, and tissues against oxidative toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1524141800,"Abstract Rat liver glucocorticoid-receptor complex (GRc) was purified 2000-fold by a combination of methods including (NH4)2SO4-fractionation and phosphocellulose and DNA-cellulose chromatography. The purified glucocorticoid receptor preparation contained a major peptide of Mr = 90,000 and the GRc sedimented as 4 S in 5-20% sucrose gradients. An additional peptide of Mr = 45,000 (45K) was also observed. Some preparations yielded only the Mr = 90,000 (90K) peptide suggesting that the 45K peptide may be a proteolyzed portion of the 90K protein. The purified GRc was incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of cAMP-dependent kinase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the above preparation revealed the presence of two 32P-containing bands with apparent Mr = 90,000 and 45,000. The 32P incorporation was dependent on the availability of divalent cation (Mg2+). GRc in cytosol labeled with [3H]dexamethasone mesylate and purified as above co-migrated with 32P-containing bands. GRc was also purified from cytosol obtained from livers of rats injected with [32P]orthophosphate. Both 32P and 3H bands were associated with 90K and 45K peptides. Our results indicate that rat liver glucocorticoid receptor is a phosphoprotein and that both the phosphorylated peptides 90K and 45K also contain the steroid and the DNA binding regions of the glucocorticoid receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1559826571,"Phenylacetylene and biphenylacetylene are oxidized by cytochrome P-450 to the corresponding arylacetic acids. The acetylenic hydrogen shifts to the adjacent carbon and one atom of molecular oxygen is incorporated into the carboxylic acid group in these transformations, which are subject to a large kinetic isotope effect when the acetylenic hydrogen is replaced by deuterium. The same products and isotope effects are observed when the two arylacetylenes are oxidized by m-chloroperbenzoic acid rather than by the enzyme. In contrast, the inactivation of cytochrome P-450 that occurs during the oxidation of phenylacetylene is insensitive to deuterium substitution. The partition ratio between metabolite formation and enzyme inactivation consequently changes from 26 to 15 in going from phenylacetylene to the deuterated analogue. Metabolite formation therefore diverges from heme alkylation very early in the catalytic process."
https://openalex.org/W1541774304,"Kinetoplast DNA of Crithidia fasciculata and other trypanosomatids is in the form of a network of thousands of minicircles and a few dozen maxicircles. Minicircles replicate as free molecules after release from the network, and their progeny subsequently reattach to the network (Englund, P. T. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4895-4900). The minicircles just released from the network are covalently closed and apparently completely relaxed. After Cairns-type (theta) replication, the two minicircle progeny have different structures. One has a nascent H (heavy) strand which initially is in the form of 20-110 nucleotide fragments that are separated by gaps (Kitchin, P. A., Klein, V. A., Fein, B. I., and Englund, P. T. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15532-15539). The other initially has a full-size (2.5 kilobase) nascent L (light) strand. During the time between formation of these progeny molecules and network reattachment, the nascent L strand is nicked (or gapped) and nascent H strand is partially repaired. Therefore, both progeny, at the time of reattachment, have several nicks (or gaps) in their nascent strand. Minicircle progeny with a nascent L strand reattach to the network quickly, whereas those with a nascent H strand reattach more slowly. Once reattached to the network, the nicks or gaps in the minicircles are repaired until finally covalent closure occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1596630681,"Ascorbate addition to primary avian tendon cells has been shown previously to cause a approximately 6-fold increase in procollagen translation that is first observable after 4 h and reaches a maximum level after 48 h. Similarly, procollagen mRNA has been shown to increase after ascorbate addition by approximately 6-fold starting at 12 h and reaching a maximum level by 72 h. The rate constant for procollagen secretion is now shown to also react to ascorbate by a 6-fold change. This results in a drop in the half-life of procollagen within the cell from 120 to 20 min. In sharp contrast to the other steps in the procollagen pathway, the change in the secretion rate constant is extremely fast occurring in less than 30 min. Moreover, after ascorbate addition, greater than 80% of the internal procollagen can be secreted at the fast rate. Since this change results from an increase in hydroxylation of proline residues and since the hydroxylation reaction has been localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, this evidence strongly supports the model that the slow step in the secretion pathway is transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum. Further support for this comes from electron microscope autoradiography of [3H]proline-labeled cells where the labeled procollagen pool within the cells was highly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2099463774,"Uteroferrin, the iron-containing, progesterone-induced phosphatase of the porcine uterus, is a glycoprotein carrying a single oligosaccharide chain. Most of the uteroferrin isolated from either uterine secretions or allantoic fluid has endoglycosidase H-sensitive carbohydrate chains with either five or six mannose residues. As determined by 1H-NMR spectroscopy, the Man6 oligosaccharide has the following structure. (Formula: see text) The Man5 species lacks the terminal alpha 1,2-linked residue. Uteroferrin is transported across the pig placenta and has been proposed to be involved in iron transfer to the fetus (see Buhi, W. C., Ducsay, C. A., Bazer, F. W., and Roberts, R. M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 1712-1721). Injection of 125I-labeled uteroferrin into the umbilical vein of midpregnant fetuses resulted in incorporation of label into the liver, the major site of fetal erythropoiesis. Light and electron microscope autoradiography revealed that the primary sites of uteroferrin uptake were the reticuloendothelial cells lining the liver sinusoids. Reticuloendothelial cells isolated from either fetal pig or adult rat livers were shown to accumulate uteroferrin when cultured in vitro. Uptake was inhibited by yeast mannan and by glycopeptides isolated from either ovalbumin or uteroferrin. Rat cells did not accumulate uteroferrin whose high mannose chains had been removed using endoglycosidase H. Moreover, the K uptake values (3 X 10(-7) M), specific competition by D-mannose and L-fucose bovine serum albumin, and inhibition by EDTA are consistent with an uptake mechanism involving a receptor for high-mannose oligosaccharides on the liver sinusoidal cells. It is suggested that one function of this receptor in the fetal pig is to remove maternally derived uterine glycoproteins from the fetal circulation. In the case of uteroferrin this process provides iron to the fetal liver."
https://openalex.org/W1597029404,"The half-lives of turnover of plasma membrane proteins in rat hepatoma tissue, culture cells, and in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes have been analyzed after resolution by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Cell membranes were externally labeled via iodination catalyzed by lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase. A bimodal pattern of turnover was found for the externally oriented plasma membrane proteins of rat hepatoma cells. Three glycoproteins analyzed in these cells had an average t 1/2 of 22 h while eight proteins which did not bind to concanavalin A had an average t 1/2 of 80 h. In contrast, more heterogeneous rates of turnover were found for the externally oriented plasma membrane proteins of primary cultures of hepatocytes. Most, if not all, of the membrane proteins accessible to iodination in these cells were glycoproteins. Among the glycoproteins resolved by two-dimensional polyacrylamide electrophoresis, the receptors for asialoglycoproteins had the shortest half-lives (18 h). Other glycoproteins, mostly with higher molecular weights and different isoelectric points, showed a spectrum of half-lives ranging from 16 to 99 h. The turnover rates of membrane proteins of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were also determined with [3H]- and [35S]methionine labeling of cells. Heterogeneous rates of turnover again were found among the labeled glycoproteins and nonglycoproteins. Among the 10 glycoproteins individually analyzed, the half-lives range from 17 to 67 h. Among the 21 proteins which do not bind to concanavalin A, the half-lives range from 18 h to more than 100 h. Three proteins analyzed showed an apparent biphasic pattern of turnover, having a fast phase with a half-life of 4-6 h and a slow phase with a half-life of 15-29 h. Several nonglycoproteins, including clathrin and actin associated with membrane vesicles had extremely long half-lives. The more than 5-fold difference in the half-life between clathrin and the receptors for asialoglycoproteins, which coexist in coated pits indicates that intrinsic proteins of the coated pits turn over at a different rate than peripheral components."
https://openalex.org/W1584822169,"The fluorescent sterol delta 5,7,9(11)-cholestatrien-3 beta-ol (cholestatrienol) was used as an analogue of cholesterol to determine the properties of the sterol in aqueous buffer and the interaction of cholesterol with sterol and squalene carrier protein (SCP). Cholestatrienol was synthesized and purified to a stable product by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The critical micelle concentration of cholestatrienol in aqueous buffer was 1 nM while its maximum solubility was 1.15 microM as ascertained from fluorescence polarization and light scattering properties, respectively. Several lines of evidence indicated a close molecular interaction of cholestatrienol with purified rat liver SCP. The fluorescence emission spectrum of monomeric cholestatrienol in aqueous buffer was blue shifted upon addition of SCP. The fluorescence lifetime of monomeric cholestatrienol in aqueous buffer was increased by SCP from 5 to 12 ns. The SCP increased the fluorescence polarization of monomeric cholestatrienol from 0.002 to 0.38 in aqueous buffer. The close molecular interaction of cholestatrienol with SCP was also demonstrated by energy transfer experiments. Fluorescence energy transfer from tyrosine residues of SCP to the conjugated triene fluorophore in cholestatrienol had a transfer efficiency of 59%. R, the apparent distance between the tyrosine energy donor and the cholestatrienol energy acceptor, was 16.3 A. Binding analysis indicated that cholestatrienol interacted with SCP with an apparent KD = 0.5 microM and a Bmax = 3.54 microM. One mol of cholestatrienol was bound per mol of SCP. These results demonstrate the utility of cholestatrienol not only as a membrane sterol probe molecule but also as a probe for sterol-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1516565264,"The human erythrocyte nucleoside transporter has been identified as a band 4.5 polypeptide (Mr 45,000-66,000) on the basis of reversible binding and photoaffinity labeling experiments with the nucleoside transport inhibitor, nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR). In the present study, the NBMPR-binding protein was extracted from protein-depleted human erythrocyte “ghosts” with Triton X-100 and reconstituted into soybean phospholipid vesicles by a freeze-thaw-sonication procedure. The reconstituted proteoliposomes exhibited nitrobenzylthioguanosine (NBTGR)-sensitive [14C]uridine transport. A partially purified preparation of the NBMPR-binding protein, consisting largely of band 4.5 polypeptides, was also shown to have nucleoside transport activity. This band 4.5 preparation exhibited a 10-fold increase in uridine transport activity and a 7-fold increase in NBMPR-binding activity relative to the crude membrane extract. Uridine transport by the reconstituted band 4.5 preparation was saturable (apparent Km = 0.21 mM; Vmax = 9 nmol/mg of protein/5 s) and was inhibited by dipyridamole, dilazep, adenosine, and inosine. The vesicles reconstituted with the band 4.5 preparation also exhibited stereospecific glucose transport which was inhibited by cytochalasin B, but unaffected by NBTGR. In contrast, cytochalasin B was a poor inhibitor of NBTGR-sensitive uridine transport. These experiments implicate band 4.5 polypeptides in both nucleoside and sugar permeation."
https://openalex.org/W1529845938,"High resolution 31P NMR spectra (103.2 MHz) of oxygenated Catharanthus roseus and Daucus carota cells grown in suspension cultures were obtained using a solenoidal perfusion probe. The spectra showed resonances for various phosphorylated metabolites such as ATP, ADP, NAD(P)(H), nucleoside diphosphoglucose, and sugar phosphates. The relative levels of the phosphorylated metabolites remained constant throughout the growth curve. No resonances for storage compounds such as polyphosphates, pyrophosphate, or phytates were observed. Two resolved resonances for Pi indicated an intracellular pH of 7.3 and 5.7 (or below) for the cytoplasm and vacuoles, respectively. The time course of Pi uptake and storage during growth in fresh culture medium was followed by studying the level of vacuolar Pi with 31P NMR (145.7 MHz). Simultaneously, the level of Pi in the culture medium was followed with radioactive 32P. C. roseus quickly takes up all the Pi from the culture medium (maximum rate 1.7 mumol min-1 g-1 (dry weight of cells]. The Pi is first stored in the vacuoles; subsequently, one part of this pool is used to keep a constant cytoplasmic Pi level while another part is apparently accumulated as an NMR invisible Pi store, probably in another cell organelle. In contrast, D. carota does not accumulate Pi in the vacuoles and consequently it takes up Pi from the medium at a much slower rate (0.05 mumol min-1 g-1 (dry weight of cells]."
https://openalex.org/W1556474484,"Growth of methotrexate-resistant dihydrofolate reductase gene-amplified KB cells in the presence of 5-fluorouracil results in an increase in dihydrofolate reductase mRNA. This increase can be solely attributed to a species of RNA of approximately 3.5 kilobase pairs in size. Although dihydrofolate reductase enzyme activity increases per cell with increasing 5-fluorouracil, there is a decrease of enzyme activity per mg of protein (Dolnick, B. J., and Pink, J. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13299-13306). The rate of in vivo enzyme synthesis, as assayed by immunoprecipitation and supported by gel electrophoresis, does not decrease and may in fact increase with increasing 5-fluorouracil. Translation of purified dihydrofolate reductase mRNA in vitro shows that the rate of translation is unaffected by 5-fluorouracil incorporation into mRNA. The inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by a monospecific polyclonal antiserum is reduced with extracts from 5-fluorouracil-treated cells. Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by methotrexate is significantly reduced in extracts from 5-fluorouracil-treated cells compared to control extracts. Tight binding of [3H]methotrexate is also different in extracts from 5-fluorouracil-treated cells. This data supports the hypothesis of translational miscoding during protein synthesis as a major mechanism of 5-fluorouracil-mediated cytotoxicity and suggests a new mechanism of 5-fluorouracil-methotrexate antagonism."
https://openalex.org/W1522837765,"In culture, vascular smooth muscle cells grow and form a confluent monolayer of cells. Under appropriate conditions, regions of the monolayer can be induced to draw away from the substrate and form multicellular nodules. The ultrastructure of the cells in the nodules appears to be similar to that of differentiated smooth muscle cells. The process of nodulation is associated with the synthesis of a unique protein whose molecular weight is estimated from gradient gel electrophoresis to be 38,000 (38-kDa Protein). The protein is secreted into the culture medium and can be detected either by metabolic labeling or by staining with Coomassie Blue. Partial purification of 38-kDa Protein was achieved using affinity chromatography. The protein is adsorbed to heparin-agarose, but not to gelatin-agarose. The concentration of 38-kDa Protein in nodular conditioned medium is estimated at 1.9 micrograms/ml and less than 0.01 microgram/ml in conditioned medium made from monolayer cells. The presence of 5% fetal bovine serum in the labeling medium does not affect 38-kDa Protein synthesis. Cross-reactivity with fibronectin was evaluated using polyvalent antibodies to 38-kDa Protein. The 38-kDa Protein is not antigenically related to fibronectin. Furthermore, we establish that the protein is not qualitatively influenced by the presence of ascorbate (50 micrograms/ml), beta-aminoproprionitrile fumarate (50 micrograms/ml) heparin (10 ng/ml), or fibronectin (20 micrograms/ml) in the culture medium. We find that the added components neither suppress 38-kDa Protein synthesis in nodular cultures nor enhance 38-kDa Protein synthesis in monolayer cultures. The 38-kDa Protein is not detected in either monolayer or nodular cell layers and appears to be a secreted protein. Its appearance in nodular conditioned medium during nodulation suggests a relationship with that process."
https://openalex.org/W1525602047,"The soluble form of dopamine beta-hydroxylase from bovine adrenal medulla has previously been shown to exist as a tetrameric species of Mr = 290,000 composed of two disulfide-linked dimers. Here we report that this enzyme can also undergo a reversible tetramerdimer dissociation which is dependent on pH. Gel permeation chromatography of dopamine beta-hydroxylase at pH 5.0 demonstrates a Stokes radius of 5.8 nm. When the pH is shifted to 5.7, the Stokes radius changes to 6.9 nm. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the purified enzyme demonstrates that this change in molecular size is due to a change in molecular weight. At low protein concentration, the estimated Mr of the enzyme is 145,000 at pH 5.0 and at high protein concentration approaches 290,000 at pH 5.7. This change in Mr is consistent with the existence of a tetramer-dimer dissociation and a change in the equilibrium constant from 1.8 X 10(-6) M to 1.16 X 10(-9) M when the pH is increased from 5.0 to 5.7. This pH-dependent subunit dissociation is correlated with pH-dependent changes in enzyme activity. Purified bovine-soluble dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity is a hyperbolic function of tyramine concentration at pH 5.0. However, the hydroxylase activity displays non-hyperbolic kinetics at pH 6.0. The kinetic data obtained at pH 6.0 can be accounted for by fitting to a model containing two nonidentical catalytic forms of enzyme generated by the pH-dependent partial dissociation of tetrameric enzyme to dimeric subunits. The two catalytic forms have apparently identical maximal velocities; however, they differ in their Michaelis constants for the substrate; the dimeric form having a low Km and the tetrameric form having a high Km. Since the pH inside bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin granules is approximately 5.5, we conclude that the subunits of dopamine beta-hydroxylase are in dynamic dissociation in a physiologically important pH range."
https://openalex.org/W1533842075,"The influence of structural modifications in sterols and phospholipids on the rate of polyene antibiotic-sterol interaction was studied. For filipin and amphotericin B association with sterols in vesicles, a preferential interaction was found with sterols whose side chain length is close to that of cholesterol. Introduction of trans double bonds into the sterol side chain did not alter the rate of interaction in vesicles. The delta 7-bond of the sterol appears to be of critical importance in amphotericin B-sterol interaction, whereas the delta 5-bond is not essential. These observations are relevant to the well-known effects of amphotericin B on cell membranes containing ergosterol compared with those containing cholesterol. The dependence of the rates of sterol-polyene antibiotic interaction on the phospholipid composition of the vesicles indicates that phospholipid vesicles may be an inadequate model for reaching a comprehensive understanding of the effects exerted on biological membranes by these agents."
https://openalex.org/W1571168065,"High resolution gel electrophoresis was used to monitor the successive addition of dNMP residues onto the 3'-OH ends of discrete 5'-32P-primers, during DNA synthesis on natural templates. Resulting autoradiographic banding patterns revealed considerable variation in the relative rates of incorporation at different positions along the template. The pattern of along the template was unique for each of three different DNA polymerases (polymerase I (the large fragment form of Escherichia coli), T4 polymerase (encoded by bacteriophage T4), and AMV polymerase (DNA polymerase of avian myeloblastosis virus]. Most pause sites were not caused by attenuation of polymerization at regions of local secondary structure in the template. Assays of the accuracy of incorporation at different positions along the template (in which elongation was monitored in the presence of only 3 of the 4 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates) strongly suggested that the relative fidelity of DNA synthesis catalyzed by different polymerases depends on the position on the template at which the comparison is made. Primer-templates were constructed that permitted comparison of elongation during synthesis on a single-stranded template with that during polymerization through a double-stranded region (wherein elongation required concomitant displacement of a strand annealed adjacent to the 5'-32P-primer). Although strand displacement DNA synthesis catalyzed by polymerase I occurred approximately ten times more slowly than synthesis in the same region of a single-stranded viral template, most of the pause sites were the same in the presence or absence of tandem primer. Electrophoretic assays of the fidelity of DNA synthesis suggested that an increased tendency toward misincorporational hotspots occurred when elongation required concomitant strand displacement."

The exact start site of transcription was localized with a primer extension experiment. The region upstream of the start of transcription shows only scattered homologies with the analogous sequences in the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) mouse collagen genes although these genes are often co-expressed and co-regulated. The most striking homology with the type I gene is seen around the start of translation. This region contains an inverted repeat which could form a stem-loop structure with a calculated delta G of -30 kcal in the type III collagen mRNA. When compared to the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) signal peptides, the signal peptide of mouse alpha 1(III) collagen presents less homology than when these segments are compared to each other."
https://openalex.org/W1529203463,"A phospholipid or membrane surface is a required component of the prothrombinase complex, yet little is known about the influence of the lipid on the assembly and expression of this complex. Vesicles composed of synthetic phospholipids were used to investigate the effects of membrane on the prothrombinase complex. All vesicle types studied were capable of supporting the prothrombinase reaction which in each case was characterized by a similar apparent Km. The binding constants for the interaction of Factor Va and prothrombin with synthetic phospholipid vesicles were not significantly affected by temperature. The rate of thrombin production, however, increased with increasing temperature. The fluidity of the vesicles was assessed by measuring the fluorescence lifetimes, steady state anisotropies, and differential phase fluorometry of diphenylhexatriene embedded in the vesicles. No correlation was observed between the fluidity of the vesicles and the steady-state rate of thrombin production, even when the enzymatic activity was monitored below and above the phase transition temperature of the lipid vesicles. A distinct correlation, however, was found between the fluidity of the vesicle and the time required to reach the maximum rate of thrombin production (pre-steady-state interval). We believe that this lag time corresponds to the time required for the assembly of the prothrombinase complex. Thus, although lipid fluidity does affect the assembly of the prothrombinase complex, after the complex is assembled, this property has little effect on the catalytic process itself."
https://openalex.org/W1549012236,"Two different putative precursor polypeptides of rat liver fumarase were synthesized when RNA prepared from rat liver were translated in vitro using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. One of these putative precursor polypeptides (P1) was synthesized as a larger molecular mass than the mature subunit of fumarase (45,000 daltons) by about 5,000 daltons and the other (P2) had the same molecular mass as the mature enzyme. When the 35S-labeled cell-free translation products were incubated with rat liver mitochondria at 30 degrees C, P1 and the 35S-labeled mature size fumarase were associated with the mitochondria. Of these, the 35S-labeled mature size fumarase was resistant to externally added protease, but P1 was not, indicating that the 35S-labeled mature size fumarase was located in the mitochondrial matrix. The following observations strongly suggested that the 35S-labeled mature size fumarase in mitochondria was derived from P1, which was energy-dependently imported and concomitantly processed to the mature size. 1) The amount of the 35S-labeled mature size fumarase recovered from the mitochondria increased proportionally to the duration of incubation, while the amount of P1 recovered from the post-mitochondrial and mitochondrial fractions decreased with the duration of the incubation. 2) Only P1 could bind with the mitochondrial outer membrane at 0 degrees C even in the presence of an uncoupler of the oxidative phosphorylation but P2 did not. 3) P1 bound to the mitochondrial outer membrane was imported into the matrix, when the mitochondria binding only P1 at 0 degrees C was reisolated and incubated at 30 degrees C in the presence of an energy-generating system. The specific receptor was involved in the binding of P1 to mitochondria, since a high concentration of NaCl did not interfere with the binding of P1 to the membrane and did not discharge P1 bound onto the membrane. It was shown that P1 formed an aggregate composed of 6 to 8 molecules and P2 was a dimer in the cell-free translation mixture and that P1 and P2 were enzymatically inactive. These results suggest that the precursor for the mitochondrial enzyme has a larger molecular weight than that of the mature enzyme, whereas the precursor for the cytosolic enzyme has the same molecular weight as the mature enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1601082571,"From an NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the long and short form of myosin subfragment 2 we have suggested that the putative hinge region in the myosin rod is located in the COOH-terminal portion of the long subfragment 2 (Lu, R.

Comparison of the sequence with that of other portions of the rod, viz. short subfragment 2 and light meromyosin, and of tropomyosin shows that the hinge region shares some feature of a coiled-coil helical structure, but it has somewhat fewer hydrophobic coil-coil interactions and there is a significant number of charged residues in the hydrophobic core region. This suggests that the stability of the putative hinge region would be reduced in comparison with other coiled-coil structures."
https://openalex.org/W1500500878,"Tylorrhynchus cyanomethemoglobin reduced with dithiothreitol was separated by chromatofocusing into four heme-containing polypeptide chains (I, IIA, IIB, and IIC) and a non-heme chain (N). The molecular weights of chains IIA-C and N were confirmed to be the same by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate on a 10-20% gradient gel. The molecular weight of chain IIC was determined to be 17,415 (including heme) from the amino acid sequence. Chain N constitutes less than 5% of the total protein and has the same NH2-terminal sequence, suggesting that it is derived from chain IIA during the isolation procedure. Tylorrhynchus hemoglobin consists of two types of subunit with molecular weights of 16,327 (chain I) and approximately 50,000, and the latter splits into chains IIA-C in the presence of a reducing agent. On the basis of the accurate value obtained for the molecular mass of chain IIC, it was concluded that the subunit of approximately 50,000 daltons is a trimer of heme-containing chains IIA, IIB, and IIC linked by disulfide bonds. The cysteine residue at position 5 and the arginine at position 10 are conserved in the four heme-containing chains of Tylorrhynchus hemoglobin. The complete sequence of 149 residues of Tylorrhynchus chain IIC was determined. This sequence shows high homology with Tylorrhynchus chain I (Suzuki, T., Takagi, T., and Gotoh, T. (1982) Biochem. Biophys. Acta 708, 253-258) and Lumbricus chain AIII (Garlick, R. L., and Riggs, A. F. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9005-9015)."

https://openalex.org/W1651044861,"We have previously found (Luduena, R. F., and Roach, M. C. (1981b) Biochemistry 20, 4444-4450) that colchicine and podophyllotoxin inhibit the alkylation of tubulin by iodo[14C]acetamide and the formation of an intrachain cross-link in the beta-tubulin subunit by N,N'-ethylenebis(iodoacetamide) (EBI). It was not clear whether these effects were due to conformational changes in tubulin induced by drugs or to direct steric blockage of the sulfhydryl groups involved. In an effort to characterize further these phenomena, we have examined the effects of single-ring and bicyclic analogues of colchicine on the reaction of tubulin with iodo[14C]acetamide and EBI. We have found that neither the A-ring analogues, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl alcohol, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde, 2,3,4-trimethoxybenzaldehyde, and benzaldehyde, nor the C-ring analogues, tropolone and tropolone methyl ether, inhibited alkylation. In contrast, colchicine, podophyllotoxin, and nocodazole and the bicyclic analogues, 5-(2',3',4'-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-methoxytropone and combretastatin, inhibited tubulin alkylation. Since the presence of a bond joining the A and C rings seems to be the determining factor in the suppression of alkylation, it is likely that inhibition by colchicine of the reaction with iodo[14C] acetamide is due largely to a conformational change induced by colchicine. A different pattern was obtained when the effects on cross-link formation by EBI were examined. Here, all the A-ring analogues, the bicyclic analogues, and colchicine, podophyllotoxin, and nocodazole all inhibited formation of the cross-link, whereas the C-ring analogue tropolone methyl ether did not inhibit cross-link formation. Since compounds whose effect on alkylation is markedly different have the same effect on cross-link formation, it is possible that this effect is a steric one and that perhaps the A-ring of colchicine binds to tubulin very close to one of the sulfhydryls involved in the intrachain cross-link formed by EBI in beta-tubulin."

https://openalex.org/W1583920493,"A plasmid carrying the bacteriophage T7.3 endonuclease gene under the control of the lacUV5 promoter could be maintained in the transcriptionally active state only in recA+ strains. In recA- strains, endonuclease induction resulted in extensive degradation of the genomic DNA and cell death. In sharp contrast, the plasmid DNA remained intact in the supercoiled form. In recA+ strains, the recA protein levels were increased and the SOS functions of the host were activated, as shown by measurements of recA protein synthesis and prophage induction. These results indicate that in normal undisrupted and non-irradiated cells, enzymatic nucleolytic damage can induce the SOS response and can be controlled by the DNA repair system of the host. In addition, the higher sensitivity of the genomic DNA to the single-strand-specific endonuclease relative to the plasmid suggests that the two molecules differ in their physiological states and most likely in their degree of single-stranded content."
https://openalex.org/W1588995855,"Human erythrocyte spectrin of high purity was studied alone and mixed with rabbit skeletal actin by dynamic rheometry as a function of protein concentration at pH 7.4 and 24 degrees C. Pure spectrin had a very low storage modulus, G', increasing slightly with increase in protein concentration (approximately 3 dynes/cm at 25 mg/ml). In contrast, unpurified cytoskeletal extracts containing spectrin, actin, and band 4.1 showed a marked concentration dependence for G', increasing to 150 dynes/cm at 20 mg/ml. Mixtures of purified spectrin and skeletal actin at a weight ratio of 4:1 also showed G' markedly dependent on concentration (approximately 150-200 dynes/cm at 20 mg/ml). Maximum elasticity of spectrin-actin gels occurred at a molar ratio of actin monomers to spectrin tetramers of 14:1. We conclude that the reconstituted in vitro spectrin-actin network consists of actin fibers cross-linked by spectrin tetramers at regular intervals. The gel is rapidly reformed after mechanical disruption or thermal collapse, indicating that the polymer fibers are in equilibrium with the constituent monomers."
https://openalex.org/W1526467696,"While the equilibrium assumption and the validity of using total measured concentrations for near equilibrium indicator reactions have been widely tested in liver, these have not been systematically evaluated in skeletal muscle. Vascularly isolated dog gracilis muscles were stimulated via the nerve at 4 Hz, and tissue was sampled by quick freezing at rest and after 10, 15, 30, 60, and 180 s of stimulation or after stimulation in the presence of glycolytic blockade by iodoacetate. Phosphocreatine, creatine, and several glycolytic intermediates were measured in tissue extracts. The in vivo mass action ratios for triosephosphate isomerase and aldolase were evaluated relative to substrate concentrations and compared with equilibrium constants determined in vitro. Although there was evidence of substrate binding at low substrate levels for the triosephosphate isomerase reaction, the in vivo mass action ratios for both reactions stabilized at a constant value at moderate substrate levels and in glycolytically blocked muscles. It was concluded that both enzymes are in apparent equilibrium in vivo, but the equilibrium constants are lower than those determined in vitro. The mass action ratios of the combined creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase reactions were determined for resting muscles. These reactions are also at equilibrium and the equilibrium constants are consistent with in vitro values."

These homologous organophosphorous agents contain the environmentally sensitive 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole chromophore. They inhibit acetylcholinesterase from Torpedo at rates exceeding 10(7) M-1 min-1 to form long-lived conjugates with one chromophore/80-kilodalton subunit. The intensity, position, and line width of the absorption spectra of the conjugates and reactivation kinetics in the presence and absence of the bisquaternary oxime 1,1'-trimethylene-bis(4-formylpyridinium bromide) dioxime indicate that these agents form conjugates in which the NBD-aminoalkyl moieties experience distinctive microscopic environments within the active center. NBD-aminoethyl methylphosphono-acetylcholinesterase undergoes oxime-induced as well as spontaneous reactivation at rates that are 3.6 and 35 times faster, respectively, than the corresponding rates measured for the NBD-aminopentyl conjugate. Hence, reactivation exhibits a marked dependence on structure of the methylphosphonate. Fluorescence emission at wavelengths greater than 520 nm is highly quenched and exhibits quantum efficiencies of less than 5%. Absorption maxima for the covalent NBD-aminoethyl methylphosphono-acetylcholinesterase appear at 475-480 nm while those for the corresponding NBD-aminopentyl methylphosphono-acetylcholinesterase appear at 485-490 nm. Bandwidths of the absorption maxima are substantially broader for the acetylcholinesterase adduct with NBD-aminoethyl methylphosphonofluoridate (3870 cm-1) than for the enzyme adduct with NBD-aminopentyl methylphosphonofluoridate (2870 cm-1). The CD spectrum of NBD-aminopentyl methylphosphono-acetylcholinesterase shows optical activity coincident with the shape and position of the absorption spectrum. In contrast, in addition to optically active transitions at the absorption maxima, the CD spectrum of NBD-aminoethyl methylphosphono-acetylcholinesterase shows intense optical activity at 430 nm, a wavelength region coincident with the region of spectral broadening. The spectral properties of alpha-chymotrypsin conjugates formed by reaction with the two probes are different, and the respective spectra differ also from those observed for the acetylcholinesterase conjugates. These results indicate that there is a reciprocal relationship between the structure of the probe and the structure of the active center.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

A 5-hydroxytryptamine moiety has been coupled to a Sepharose 4B matrix in a position ortho to the hydroxyl group. When membranes solubilized with sodium cholate are chromatographed on the above matrix a 45,000 Mr polypeptide is highly enriched. The enrichment is dependent on the presence of the proper ligand on the matrix and is inhibited if the column is previously equilibrated with a soluble ligand. Enrichment of the above polypeptide is accompanied by an increase in the specific activity of the transporter as measured by its labeling by 4-azido-3-nitrophenylazo(5-hydroxytryptamine). The ability of reserpine, a competitive inhibitor of binding and transport, to inhibit labeling of the purified transporter correlates well with its known kinetic constants in the native membranes. The polypeptide purified is identical to the one previously identified as the putative transporter based on specific labeling by a photoaffinity label (Gabizon, R., Yetinzon, T., and Schuldiner, S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 15145-15150). The results clearly support the contention that the 45,000 Mr peptide is the amine transporter or one of its subunits."

That the inhibition of protein synthesis was a consequence of activation of the 2-5A-dependent endonuclease by the 3'-deoxyadenosine analogs of 2-5A was demonstrated in obtaining the ribosomal RNA cleavage pattern that is characteristic of endonuclease activation by parent 2-5A. Additional results (i.e. lack of activity by the dimer species ppp5'(3'dA)2'p5'-(3'dA) or the monomer 3'dA) as well as kinetic analysis both in intact cells and in cell-free extracts provided further evidence that the inhibition of protein synthesis observed with these 3'-deoxyadenosine 2-5A analogs was not due to their degradation to the antimetabolite monomer unit 3'-deoxyadenosine."

https://openalex.org/W4626609,"We have isolated a tropomyosin binding protein (TMBP) from human platelets using isoelectric fractionation, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and affinity chromatography on skeletal muscle tropomyosin-Affi-Gel 15. TMBP is a 67,000-Da monomeric protein that binds to muscle and nonmuscle tropomyosin affinity resins. Its affinity for platelet tropomyosin is greater than for rabbit skeletal or chicken gizzard tropomyosin, and greater than that of troponin for all tropomyosin affinity resins tested. TMBP forms a complex with platelet tropomyosin that can be isolated on G-150. The approximate molar stoichiometry is 1:1. Troponin and TMBP have distinct binding sites on skeletal tropomyosin since binding of TMBP to tropomyosin-Affi-Gel 15 is not affected by previous saturation of the column with troponin (or vice versa). The amino acid composition of TMBP is virtually identical with that of human serum albumin, and is similar to those of beta-actinin (Heizmann, C. W., Muller, G., Jenny, E., Wilson, K.

https://openalex.org/W1603968123,"Abstract Chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPD) and thymidine kinase gene (TK) were co-transfected into mouse LMTK- cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. Four of the eight hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine-containing medium-resistant, TK+ transfectants were shown to produce different amounts of chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by zymogram analysis. Subcloning and further analysis revealed that the chicken GAPD was stably inherited and that its enzyme subunits randomly combined with mouse subunits in heterotetramers. Although the contribution of chicken enzyme varied from approximately 30 to approximately 90% of the total glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity with a proportional increase in total activity in the different subclones, it did not appear to affect the expression of mouse endogenous glycolytic enzymes since there was no distinct change in the levels of either mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA nor mouse phosphoglycerate kinase enzyme activity. The levels of chicken GAPD copy number, mRNA, and enzyme apparently were generally correlated in the different subclones, suggesting that the chicken GAPD in the mouse cells were expressed constitutively. In situ hybridization revealed that the transfected genes were integrated into mouse chromosomes in one cluster, and the locations of these clusters were different in different clones. Chromatin structure analyses of the chicken GAPD in four different transfectants revealed three DNase I-hypersensitive sites located around 0.2, 2.0, and 3.4 kilobases upstream from the 5' side of the gene. These sites are also present in the same locations in chicken lymphoblastoid cells (Kuo, M. T., Iyer, B., and Schwartz, R. J.
