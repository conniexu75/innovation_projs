https://openalex.org/W1980265371,"A general process has been developed for the electrodeposition of eight of the nine refractory metals of groups IVB, VB, and VIB as dense coherent deposits. It consists essentially of the electrolysis of a solution of the refractory metal fluoride in a molten alkali-fluoride euteotic mixture, and has been shown to deposit a coating, unalloyed with the substrate, by a pro- cess that obeys Faraday's law. Some evidence exists that the electrode-reaction mechanism by which coherent coatings are deposited from molten salts incorporates an irreversible metalproducing step."

Inhibition of germination by high temperature behaves similarly. Dormancy is ascribed to balance between mechanical constraint by the endosperm and ""expansive force"" of the embryo."

The effect observed even under high confining pressure is due to formation of open cracks which first appear at one-third to two-thirds the fracture stress."

Covers dating by thermoluminescence, potassium-argon, fission-track and thorium-230 methods, detection of buried features by a variety of instruments, underwater methods, and briefly mentions analytical techniques for the identification of archeological materials. -- AATA"
https://openalex.org/W2003318525,"Three classes of models for the atmosphere of Mars differ in identifying the main ionospheric layer measured by Mariner IV as being analogous to a terrestrial F2, F1, or E layer. At an altitude of several hundred kilometers, the relative atmospheric mass densities for these models (in the order named) are approximately 1, 102, and 104, and the temperatures are roughly 100°, 200°, and 400° K. Theory and observation are in best agreement for an F2 model, for which photodissociation of CO2, and diffusive separation result in an atomic-oxygen upper atmosphere, with O+ being the principal ion in the isothermal topside of the ionosphere. The mesopause temperature minimum would be at or below the freezing point of CO2, and dry ice particles would be expected to form. However, an F1 model, with molecular ions in a mixed and warmer upper atmosphere, might result if photodissociation and diffusive separation are markedly less than would be expected from analogy with Earth's upper atmosphere. The E model proposed by Chamberlain and McElroy appears very unlikely; it is not compatible with the measured ionization profile unless rather unlikely assumptions are made about the values, and changes with height, of the effective recombination coefficient and the average ion mass. Moreover our theoretical heat-budget computations for the atmospheric region probed by Mariner IV indicate markedly lower temperatures and temperature gradients than were obtained for the E model."

https://openalex.org/W2085183354,"In a broad sky survey for x-ray sources in the 44-to 60-A range only Sco XR-1 was detected. The spectral evidence indicates that Sco XR-1 may lie within a few hundred light-years of the sun. Its spectrum appears to be complex possibly a mixture of thermal sources at different temperatures or of thermal and nonthermal components, as has been predicted for an active neutron star with an associated corona or magnetosphere."
