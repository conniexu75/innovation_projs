https://openalex.org/W2606289191,"2 dimensional (2D) strain analysis detects subclinical left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Our aim was to evaluate changes in LV systolic and diastolic function in breast cancer patients early after anthracycline chemotherapy, and to identify predisposing factors.140 patients were assessed by detailed echocardiography before and within seven days post treatment. LV ejection fraction (LVEF), global longitudinal strain (GLS), strain rate and radial and circumferential strain were assessed. Additionally, left atrial volumes and LV diastolic parameters were evaluated. LVEF although reduced after treatment, remained within the normal range (60±3% vs. 59±3%, p = 0.04). Triplane GLS was significantly reduced after treatment (-20.0±1.6% vs. -19.1±1.8%, p<0.001). Subclinical LV dysfunction (>11% reduction in GLS compared to before therapy) occurred in 22% (29/135). Impaired diastolic function grade significantly increased from 46% to 57% (p<0.001) after treatment. Furthermore, diastolic dysfunction was more common in the subgroup group with reduced systolic GLS compared to those without changes in GLS (30% vs. 11%; p = 0.04). No risk factors or clinical parameters were associated with the development of subclinical LV dysfunction; however the percentage change in early diastolic strain rate and the E velocity were independent predictors of >11% reduction in GLS.Twenty two percent of patients had subclinical LV dysfunction by GLS, whilst none had cardiotoxicity defined by LVEF, demonstrating that GLS is more sensitive for detection of subclinical LV systolic dysfunction immediately after anthracycline therapy. Diastolic dysfunction increased, particularly in the group with reduced GLS, demonstrating the close pathophysiological relationship between systolic and diastolic function."

Several studies have documented the metabolic capacity of bacteria associated with the gut, body surface, and oral secretions of these insects; however, little is known about how the bacterial community structure changes during the life cycle of the beetles. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the bacterial community of the gut of the bark beetle D. rhizophagus during the insect's life cycle using 454 pyrosequencing. A total of 4 bacterial phyla, 7 classes, 15 families and 23 genera were identified. The α-diversity was low, as demonstrated in previous studies. The dominant bacterial taxa belonged to the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae families. This low α-diversity can be attributed to the presence of defensive chemical compounds in conifers or due to different morpho-physiological factors in the gut of these insects acting as strong selective factors. Members of the genera Rahnella, Serratia, Pseudomonas and Propionibacterium were found at all life stages, and the first three genera, particularly Rahnella, were predominant suggesting the presence of a core microbiome in the gut. Significant differences in β-diversity were observed, mainly due to bacterial taxa present at low frequencies and only in certain life stages. The predictive functional profiling indicated metabolic pathways related to metabolism of amino acids and carbohydrates, and membrane transport as the most significant in the community. These differences in the community structure might be due to several selective factors, such as gut compartmentalization, physicochemical conditions, and microbial interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2605700245,"Performance for an obstacle circumvention task was assessed under conditions of visual, auditory only (using echolocation) and tactile (using a sensory substitution device, SSD) guidance. A Vicon motion capture system was used to measure human movement kinematics objectively. Ten normally sighted participants, 8 blind non-echolocators, and 1 blind expert echolocator navigated around a 0.6 x 2 m obstacle that was varied in position across trials, at the midline of the participant or 25 cm to the right or left. Although visual guidance was the most effective, participants successfully circumvented the obstacle in the majority of trials under auditory or SSD guidance. Using audition, blind non-echolocators navigated more effectively than blindfolded sighted individuals with fewer collisions, lower movement times, fewer velocity corrections and greater obstacle detection ranges. The blind expert echolocator displayed performance similar to or better than that for the other groups using audition, but was comparable to that for the other groups using the SSD. The generally better performance of blind than of sighted participants is consistent with the perceptual enhancement hypothesis that individuals with severe visual deficits develop improved auditory abilities to compensate for visual loss, here shown by faster, more fluid, and more accurate navigation around obstacles using sound."
https://openalex.org/W2607149104,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked dozens of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk. Ascertaining the functional and eventual causal mechanisms underlying these relationships has proven difficult. The majority of risk SNPs, and nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD), are found in intergenic or intronic regions and confer risk through allele-dependent expression of multiple unknown target genes. Combining GWAS results with publicly available GTEx data, generated through eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) identification studies, enables a direct association of SNPs to gene expression levels and aids in narrowing the large population of potential genetic targets for hypothesis-driven experimental cell biology. Separately, overlapping of SNPs with putative enhancer segmentations can strengthen target filtering. We report here the results of analyzing 7,607 PD risk SNPs along with an additional 23,759 high linkage disequilibrium-associated variants paired with eQTL gene expression. We found that enrichment analysis on the set of genes following target filtering pointed to a single large LD block at 6p21 that contained multiple HLA-MHC-II genes. These MHC-II genes remain associated with PD when the genes were filtered for correlation between GWAS significance and eQTL levels, strongly indicating a direct effect on PD etiology."
https://openalex.org/W2607209434,"Resistance in the sexually transmitted bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium to all recommended therapeutic antimicrobials have rapidly emerged. However, to date, internationally reported resistance surveillance data for M. genitalium strains circulating in Eastern Europe are entirely lacking. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance-associated mutations in M. genitalium in four cities in Russia and one in Estonia, 2013-2016.Consecutive urogenital samples found positive for M. genitalium during diagnostic testing were retrospectively analyzed for resistance-associated mutations in the 23S rRNA and parC genes using pyrosequencing and conventional Sanger sequencing, respectively.In total, 867 M. genitalium positive samples from 2013-2016 were analyzed. Macrolide resistance-associated mutations were detected in 4.6% of the samples from Russia (0.7-6.8% in different cities) and in 10% of the samples from Estonia. The mutations A2059G and A2058G were highly predominating in both Russia and Estonia, accounting together for 90.9% of the cases positive for nucleotide substitutions in the 23S rRNA gene. The rates of possible fluoroquinolone resistance-associated mutations were 6.2% in Russia (2.5-7.6% in different cities) and 5% in Estonia. The mutations S83I and S83N were the most frequent ones in Russia (24.4% each), whereas D87N highly predominated in Estonia (83.3% of all fluoroquinolone resistance-associated mutations). Approximately 1% of the samples in both countries harbored both macrolide and possible fluoroquinolone resistance-associated mutations, with A2058G and S83I being the most frequent combination (37.5%).The prevalence of macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance-associated mutations in M. genitalium was 4.6% and 6.2%, respectively, in Russia, and 10% and 5%, respectively, in Estonia. Despite the relatively low rates of macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in these countries, antimicrobial resistance surveillance and testing for resistance-associated mutations in M. genitalium positive cases would be valuable."
https://openalex.org/W2605925004,"The production of starch is essential for human nutrition and represents a major metabolic flux in the biosphere. The biosynthesis of starch in storage organs like barley endosperm operates via two main pathways using different substrates: starch synthases use ADP-glucose to produce amylose and amylopectin, the two major components of starch, whereas starch phosphorylase (Pho1) uses glucose-1-phosphate (G1P), a precursor for ADP-glucose production, to produce α-1,4 glucans. The significance of the Pho1 pathway in starch biosynthesis has remained unclear. To elucidate the importance of barley Pho1 (HvPho1) for starch biosynthesis in barley endosperm, we analyzed HvPho1 protein production and enzyme activity levels throughout barley endosperm development and characterized structure-function relationships of HvPho1. The molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of starch granule biosynthesis, that is, the enzymes and substrates involved in the initial transition from simple sugars to polysaccharides, remain unclear. We found that HvPho1 is present as an active protein at the onset of barley endosperm development. Notably, purified recombinant protein can catalyze the de novo production of α-1,4-glucans using HvPho1 from G1P as the sole substrate. The structural properties of HvPho1 provide insights into the low affinity of HvPho1 for large polysaccharides like starch or amylopectin. Our results suggest that HvPho1 may play a role during the initiation of starch biosynthesis in barley."
https://openalex.org/W2580413694,"Objective: Using traditional approaches, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) requires the collection of calibration data for new subjects prior to online use. Calibration time can be reduced or eliminated e.g.~by transfer of a pre-trained classifier or unsupervised adaptive classification methods which learn from scratch and adapt over time. While such heuristics work well in practice, none of them can provide theoretical guarantees. Our objective is to modify an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to work in unison with the machine learning decoder to achieve a reliable calibration-less decoding with a guarantee to recover the true class means. Method: We introduce learning from label proportions (LLP) to the BCI community as a new unsupervised, and easy-to-implement classification approach for ERP-based BCIs. The LLP estimates the mean target and non-target responses based on known proportions of these two classes in different groups of the data. We modified a visual ERP speller to meet the requirements of the LLP. For evaluation, we ran simulations on artificially created data sets and conducted an online BCI study with N=13 subjects performing a copy-spelling task. Results: Theoretical considerations show that LLP is guaranteed to minimize the loss function similarly to a corresponding supervised classifier. It performed well in simulations and in the online application, where 84.5% of characters were spelled correctly on average without prior calibration. Significance: The continuously adapting LLP classifier is the first unsupervised decoder for ERP BCIs guaranteed to find the true class means. This makes it an ideal solution to avoid a tedious calibration and to tackle non-stationarities in the data. Additionally, LLP works on complementary principles compared to existing unsupervised methods, allowing for their further enhancement when combined with LLP."
https://openalex.org/W2605893809,"We estimated the current level of knowledge concerning several biological characteristics of the Mediterranean marine fishes by carrying out a gap analysis based on information extracted from the literature, aiming to identify research trends and future needs in the field of Mediterranean fish biology that can be used in stock assessments, ecosystem modeling and fisheries management. Based on the datasets that emerged from the literature review, there is no information on any biological characteristic for 43% (n = 310) of the Mediterranean fish species, whereas for an additional 15% (n = 109) of them there is information about just one characteristic. The gap between current and desired knowledge (defined here as having information on most biological characteristics for at least half of the Mediterranean marine fishes) is smaller in length-weight relationships, which have been studied for 43% of the species, followed by spawning (39%), diet (29%), growth (25%), maturity (24%), lifespan (19%) and fecundity (17%). The gap is larger in natural mortality for which information is very scarce (8%). European hake (Merluccius merluccius), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), annular seabream (Diplodus annularis), common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus), European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus) and bogue (Boops boops) were the most studied species, while sharks and rays were among the least studied ones. Only 25 species were fully studied, i.e. there was available information on all their biological characteristics. The knowledge gaps per characteristic varied among the western, central and eastern Mediterranean subregions. The number of available records per species was positively related to total landings, while no relationship emerged with its maximum reported length, trophic level and commercial value. Future research priorities that should be focused on less studied species (e.g. sharks and rays) and mortality/fecundity instead of length-weight relationships, as well as the economy of scientific sampling (using the entire catch to acquire data on as many biological characteristics as possible) are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2606543830,"Based on the sustainable development goals, the United Nations plans to achieve equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and to end open defecation by 2030. In Ethiopia, 60% to 80% of health problems are due to communicable diseases attributable to unsafe water supply, unhygienic and unsanitary waste management, which are directly linked to the practice of open defecation. This study has aimed at assessing the implementation of community-led total sanitation and hygiene (CLTSH) and associated factors. A community-based cross-sectional study design involving 420 of the 7,225 households found in Diretiyara district was conducted in June 2014. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Using Logistic Regressions, bivariate and multivariate analyses were computed. This study showed that 66% of the respondents have knowledge of CLTSH. Eighty-nine percent of the respondents have latrine, of which 78% were constructed after the introduction of CLTSH. Eleven percent of the respondents reported to have defected in the open field and 15% of them reported that they had been recently exposed to diarrhea diseases. The occurrence of diarrheal disease was significantly associated with the extent of latrine ownership [AOR = 2.48; 95% CI 1.00, 6.12]. Attitude and perception parameters were significantly associated with consistent latrine utilization. Respondents who agreed that ""Open defecation is preferred due to the unpleasant smell and heat from the Latrine'' [COR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.34, 0.99] were 58% less likely to use the latrine consistently. In conclusion, CLTSH has increased the extent of latrine ownership and decreased practice of open defecation, and yet, intermittent latrine use and poor hygienic practice were reported. Although some fundamental misconceptions were reported, the majority of the respondents have accepted CLTSH approach as a means to ending open defecation in their village. Health extension workers and local authorities should give emphasis to achieving sustainable behavioral change on improved sanitation and good hygiene practices."
https://openalex.org/W2606647571,"Insomnia among workers reduces the quality of life, contributes toward the economic burden of healthcare costs and losses in work performance. The relationship between occupational stress and insomnia has been reported in previous studies, but there has been little attention to temperament in occupational safety and health research. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationships between temperament, occupational stress, and insomnia. The subjects were 133 Japanese daytime local government employees. Temperament was assessed using the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego-Auto questionnaire (TEMPS-A). Occupational stress was assessed using the Generic Job Stress Questionnaire (GJSQ). Insomnia was assessed using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted. In a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, it was found that the higher subdivided stress group by “role conflict” (OR = 5.29, 95% CI, 1.61–17.32) and anxious temperament score (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.19–1.49) was associated with the presence of insomnia using an adjusted model, whereas other factors were excluded from the model. The study limitations were the sample size and the fact that only Japanese local government employees were surveyed. This study demonstrated the relationships between workers’ anxious temperament, role conflict, and insomnia. Recognizing one’s own anxious temperament would lead to self-insight, and the recognition of anxious temperament and reduction of role conflict by their supervisors or coworkers would reduce the prevalence of insomnia among workers in the workplace."
https://openalex.org/W2606075818,"Community colleges are an important part of the US higher education landscape, yet the aptitude and preparedness of student transfers to baccalaureate institutions is often called into question. Examining transcript records and demographic information of nearly 70,000 students across over 15 years of registrar records at a public university, this study performed a descriptive analysis of the persistence, performance, and academic migration patterns of community college transfers, transfers from four-year institutions, and freshmen entrants. We found little difference between community college transfers and freshmen entrants in terms of post-transfer grades and persistence. Transfers from four-year institutions had higher grades but also had higher attrition rates than their peers. This study also found no strong evidence of transfer shock on students’ post-transfer grades. When examining the tendencies of students to shift fields of study during their educational pursuits, the academic migration patterns of transfer students were more concentrated than those of freshmen entrants."
https://openalex.org/W2606533717,"Human Cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infects a broad range of the population and establishes life-long latency in the infected individuals. Periodically the latently infected virus can reactivate and becomes a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. In latent infection, the viral genome is suppressed in a heterochromatic state and viral gene transcription is silenced. Upon reactivation, the repressive chromatin is remodeled to an active form, allowing viral lytic gene transcription, initiated by the expression of viral Immediate Early (IE) genes. During this process, a number of histone modification enzymes, including histone demethylases (HDMs), play important roles in driving IE expression, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. To get a better understanding of these mechanisms, we focused on two HDMs, KDM4 and KDM6, which reverse the repressive histone H3-lysine 9 and lysine 27 methylation, respectively. Our studies show that in lytic infection, both demethylases are important in the activation of viral IE gene expression. Simultaneous disruption of both via genetic or chemical methods leads to severely impaired viral IE gene expression and viral replication. Additionally, in an experimental latency-reactivation model in THP-1 cells, the KDM6 family member JMJD3 is induced upon viral reactivation and its knockdown resulted in reduced IE gene transcription. These findings suggest pharmacological inhibition of these HDMs may potentially block hCMV lytic infection and reactivation, and control the viral infection associated diseases, which are of significant unmet medical needs."
https://openalex.org/W2606242876,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of resveratrol (RSV) on cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced cell apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro, as well as changes in the MFN2 expression level.Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells were initially treated with CSE to induce apoptosis, followed by incubation either with or without RSV. Numerous techniques were used to evaluate the outcomes of the present study, including a cell counting kit-8 assay, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time qPCR), western blotting, JC-1 fluorescence, Hoechst 33342 staining, Annexin V-PI flow cytometry apoptosis analyses, and siRNA technology.A 24 h incubation in 3.5% CSE induced apoptosis in HBE cells, and pretreatment of HBE cells with RSV (20 μM) significantly suppressed the CSE-induced apoptosis, prevented the CSE-induced decrease in MFN2 levels, suppressed BAX translocation to the mitochondria, and prevented mitochondrial membrane potential loss and cytochrome C release. However, following the transfection of MFN2 siRNA, the anti-apoptotic effects of RSV were significantly attenuated.The results of the present study demonstrated that RSV may protect bronchial epithelial cells from CS-induced apoptosis in vitro by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, and MFN2 may be associated with the anti-apoptotic functions of RSV in HBE cells."
https://openalex.org/W2606327576,"The efficacy and safety of polaprezinc combined with triple therapy was compared with triple therapy alone in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. A randomized, parallel-group, open-label, controlled, prospective multicenter study was conducted in 11 cities in China. Treatment-naive patients with H. pylori-associated gastritis were randomly assigned to one of three arms for a 14-day treatment: Arm A triple therapy (omeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg, each twice daily) plus polaprezinc 75 mg twice daily; Arm B triple therapy plus polaprezinc 150 mg twice daily, or Arm C triple therapy alone. The rate of H. pylori eradication was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were symptom improvement and lower incidence of adverse events. 303 patients completed the study- 106, 96, and 101 patients in Arms A, B, and C, respectively. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed that the rate of H. pylori eradication was significantly higher for Arms A (77.0%) and B (75.9%) compared to Arm C (58.6%) (P < 0.01), whereas there was no difference between Arms A and B (P = 0.90). Per-protocol (PP) analysis showed that the rate of H. pylori eradication was significantly higher for Arms A (81.1%) and B (83.3%) compared to Arm C (61.4%) (P < 0.01), whereas there was no significant difference between Arms A and B (P = 0.62). All three groups reported significant symptom improvement at 7, 14, and 28 days after treatment, compared to baseline (P < 0.0001). The adverse event rate for Arm B (5.1%) was higher than for Arms A (2.8%) (P = 0.04) and C (1.9%) (P = 0.02). There were no serious adverse events in any group. It appears that standard dose polaprezinc combined with triple therapy can significantly improve the H. pylori eradication rate, without an increase in toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2606800054,"We explored the functional role of individual otoconia within the otolith system of mammalians responsible for the detection of linear accelerations and head tilts in relation to the gravity vector. Details of the inner structure and the shape of intact human and artificial otoconia were studied using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), including decalcification by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to discriminate local calcium carbonate density. Considerable differences between the rhombohedral faces of human and artificial otoconia already indicate that the inner architecture of otoconia is not consistent with the point group -3m. This is clearly confirmed by decalcified otoconia specimen which are characterized by a non-centrosymmetric volume distribution of the compact 3+3 branches. This structural evidence for asymmetric mass distribution was further supported by light microscopy in combination with a high speed camera showing the movement of single otoconia specimen (artificial specimen) under gravitational influence within a viscous medium (artificial endolymph). Moreover, the response of otoconia to linear acceleration forces was investigated by particle dynamics simulations. Both, time-resolved microscopy and computer simulations of otoconia acceleration show that the dislocation of otoconia include significant rotational movement stemming from density asymmetry. Based on these findings, we suggest an otolith membrane expansion/stiffening mechanism for enhanced response to linear acceleration transmitted to the vestibular hair cells."
https://openalex.org/W2606791744,"Background Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen, causing meningitis and septicemia. We previously demonstrated that the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is an entry site for zoonotic S. suis infection. Here we studied the contribution of Streptococcal adhesin Protein (SadP) to host-pathogen interaction at GIT level. Methods SadP expression in presence of Intestinal Epithelial Cells (IEC) was compared with expression of other virulence factors by measuring transcript levels using quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR). SadP variants were identified by phylogenetic analysis of complete DNA sequences. The interaction of SadP knockout and complementation mutants with IEC was tested in vitro. Results Expression of sadP was significantly increased in presence of IEC. Sequence analysis of 116 invasive strains revealed five SadP sequence variants, correlating with genotype. SadP1, present in zoonotic isolates of clonal complex 1, contributed to binding to both human and porcine IEC and translocation across human IEC. Antibodies against the globotriaosylceramide Gb3/CD77 receptor significantly inhibited adhesion to human IEC. Conclusion SadP is involved in the host-pathogen interaction in the GIT. Differences between SadP variants may determine different affinities to the Gb3/CD77 host-receptor, contributing to variation in adhesion capacity to host IEC and thus to S. suis zoonotic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2605640979,Purpose To investigate whether baseline optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters can predict the treatment frequency of intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) injections during the first year in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) treated with pro re nata (PRN) IVR injections. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 68 eyes of 63 patients with center-involved DME who received IVR injections for 12 months or longer according to three monthly IVR injections followed by the PRN dosing. We measured the mean retinal thicknesses in the individual subfields of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid and evaluated the qualitative and quantitative parameters on OCT sectional images. We investigated the relationship between these OCT parameters at baseline and the number of IVR injections during the 12-month follow-up. Results Three loading doses were administered to 10 eyes; four to seven annualized IVR injections were administered to 34 eyes. The number of eyes that received IVR injections decreased gradually until month 6 and was almost constant from months 7 to 11. No relationships were seen between the treatment frequency and baseline systemic factors and the ophthalmic examination findings. Univariate analyses showed that the number of IVR injections during the first year was associated with the mean retinal thickness in the individual subfields and the transverse length of the disrupted external limiting membrane (ELM) and ellipsoid zone of the photoreceptors. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association with the thickness in the inferior subfield alone. The treatment frequency during the 12-month follow-up was not correlated with improved visual acuity but was associated with the decrease in the central subfield thickness and disrupted ELM. Conclusion The retinal thickness in the inferior subfield predicts the treatment frequency during the first year in eyes with DME treated with PRN IVR injections.
https://openalex.org/W2606653462,"To present treatment coverage rates and risk factors associated with uncorrected refractive error in Australia.Thirty population clusters were randomly selected from all geographic remoteness strata in Australia to provide samples of 1738 Indigenous Australians aged 40 years and older and 3098 non-Indigenous Australians aged 50 years and older. Presenting visual acuity was measured and those with vision loss (worse than 6/12) underwent pinhole testing and hand-held auto-refraction. Participants whose corrected visual acuity improved to be 6/12 or better were assigned as having uncorrected refractive error as the main cause of vision loss. The treatment coverage rates of refractive error were calculated (proportion of participants with refractive error that had distance correction and presenting visual acuity better than 6/12), and risk factor analysis for refractive correction was performed.The refractive error treatment coverage rate in Indigenous Australians of 82.2% (95% CI 78.6-85.3) was significantly lower than in non-Indigenous Australians (93.5%, 92.0-94.8) (Odds ratio [OR] 0.51, 0.35-0.75). In Indigenous participants, remoteness (OR 0.41, 0.19-0.89 and OR 0.55, 0.35-0.85 in Outer Regional and Very Remote areas, respectively), having never undergone an eye examination (OR 0.08, 0.02-0.43) and having consulted a health worker other than an optometrist or ophthalmologist (OR 0.30, 0.11-0.84) were risk factors for low coverage. On the other hand, speaking English was a protective factor (OR 2.72, 1.13-6.45) for treatment of refractive error. Compared to non-Indigenous Australians who had an eye examination within one year, participants who had not undergone an eye examination within the past five years (OR 0.08, 0.03-0.21) or had never been examined (OR 0.05, 0.10-0.23) had lower coverage.Interventions that increase integrated optometry services in regional and remote Indigenous communities may improve the treatment coverage rate of refractive error. Increasing refractive error treatment coverage rates in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians through at least five-yearly eye examinations and the provision of affordable spectacles will significantly reduce the national burden of vision loss in Australia."

https://openalex.org/W2605835829,"Overactive bladder (OAB) is a prevalent condition characterized by lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Age, education, income, marital status, sleep, and emotional problems have been associated with OAB; however, conflicting results exist. The present study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of OAB and comprehensively analyze its associated factors in a large cross-sectional, population-based study. The data of 94,554 participants aged 19-107 were analyzed from the Korean Community Health Survey (KCHS) of 2012. Data on marital status, physical activity, education level, occupation, body mass index (BMI), income level, sleep time, and stress level were retrieved for all enrolled participants. The overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) was used to evaluate the presence and degree of OAB. Simple and multiple logistic regression analyses with complex sampling were used for the associations between various factors and the presence of OAB. Overall, OAB was present in approximately 2.9% of the participants. The prevalence of OAB increased with age and steeply increased after 60 years of age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for each 10 years = 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.61-1.80, P<0.001). The prevalence of OAB was lower in married than unmarried subjects (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.48-0.72, P<0.001). The prevalence of OAB was significantly different according to occupation Compared to manager, expert, specialist, clerk group, the prevalence of OAB was highest in unemployed group (AOR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.55-2.32, P < 0.001). Being underweight was correlated with OAB (AOR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.08-1.55, P = 0.018). Inadequate sleep showed a significant association with OAB (AOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02-1.25 for ≤6 hours of sleep time and AOR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.27-1.86 for ≥9 hours of sleep, P<0.001). Stress level showed a dose-dependent positive association with OAB [AOR (95% CI) = 3.91 (3.13-4.89) > 2.16 (1.88-2.48) > 1.39 (1.23-1.57) for severe stress > moderate stress > some stress, respectively, P<0.001]. A medical history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and/or cerebral stroke was significantly related to OAB. Approximately 2.9% of adult Korean men experienced OAB based on the OABSS. Unmarried status; occupation; being underweight; inadequate sleep; stress; and medical history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or cerebral stroke were significantly correlated with OAB."
https://openalex.org/W2605911023,"Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment is the most common therapy to prevent progression and recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Although the immunoreaction elicited by BCG treatment is well documented, those induced by intravesical treatment with chemotherapeutic agents are much less known. We investigated the immunological profiles caused by mitomycin C, gemcitabine, adriamycin and docetaxel in the N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN)-induced orthotopic bladder cancer mouse model. Ninety mice bearing orthotopic bladder cancer induced by BBN were randomly divided into six groups and treated with chemotherapeutic agents once a week for four weeks. After last treatment, bladder and serum samples were analyzed for cell surface and immunological markers (CD4, CD8, CD56, CD204, Foxp3, and PD-L1) using immunohistochemistry staining. Serum and urine cytokine levels were evaluated by ELISA. All chemotherapeutic agents presented anti-tumor properties similar to those of BCG. These included changes in immune cells that resulted in fewer M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells around tumors. This result was compatible with those in human samples. Intravesical chemotherapy also induced systemic changes in cytokines, especially urinary interleukin (IL)-17A and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), as well as in the distribution of blood neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Our findings suggest that intravesical treatment with mitomycin C and adriamycin suppresses protumoral immunity while enhancing anti-tumor immunity, possibly through the action of specific cytokines. A better understanding of the immunoreaction induced by chemotherapeutic agents can lead to improved outcomes and fewer side effects in intravesical chemotherapy against NMIBC."
https://openalex.org/W2605569697,"A relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and folate has been reported. Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is currently one of the most reliable biomarkers for AD. We investigated the correlation between serum folate levels and amyloid imaging to clarify whether serum folate could be a biomarker for AD. We also examined the usefulness of a combined assessment of serum folate levels and red blood cell hemoglobin content. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphisms were also assessed. Serum folate levels and hemoglobin content were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis for their diagnostic capability as AD biomarkers relating to brain amyloid β accumulation. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for serum folate was 0.136 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.000–0.312; p = 0.016). The AUC for hemoglobin content was 0.848 (95% CI: 0.661–1.000; p = 0.021). Therefore, the folate deficiency with low folate levels or the non-anaemia with high hemoglobin content levels were found to have a high probability of also testing positive for amyloid. Furthermore, eight patients were found to be folate deficiency and non-anaemia, those who were consist of 7 amyloid positive patients (87.5%), and only one of the amyloid negative patients (12.5%). These results suggest that a deficiency of serum folate and high hemoglobin levels may reflect an increased risk of amyloid β accumulation in the brain. Additionally, we demonstrated that these biomarkers could enhance the effectiveness of APOE as an AD biomarker. This study reveals that the combined assessment of serum folate levels and red blood cell hemoglobin content may be a useful biomarker for amyloid β accumulation in the brain. We also found that the combination of serum folate levels and hemoglobin content is a more specific and sensitive blood biomarker for AD than APOE or folate alone. These findings may be used to support clinical diagnosis of AD using a simple blood test."

Current therapeutics for managing these conditions may interfere with the host response leading to immune suppression. We recently developed an annexin (Anx) A1-derived peptide, coined CR-AnxA12-50, which displays potent pro-resolving and tissue protective actions. Herein, we designed a novel peptide using CR-AnxA12-50 as a template that was significantly more resistant to neutrophil-mediated degradation. This peptide, termed CR-AnxA12-48, retained high affinity and specificity to the pro-resolving Lipoxin A4 receptor (ALX) with an IC50 of ~20nM. CR-AnxA12-48 dose dependently (100fM-10nM) promoted the efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, an action that was mediated by the murine orthologue of human ALX. The neutrophil-directed actions were also retained with human primary cells were CR-AnxA12-48 reduced human neutrophil recruitment to activated endothelial cells at concentrations as low as 100 pM. This protective action was mediated by human ALX, since incubation of neutrophils with an anti-ALX antibody reversed this anti-inflammatory actions of CR-AnxA12-48. Administration of this peptide to mice during dermal inflammation led to a significant and dose dependent decrease in neutrophil recruitment. This reduction in neutrophil numbers was more pronounced than that displayed by the parent peptide CR-AnxA12-50. CR-AnxA12-48 was also cardioprotecitve reducing infarct size and systemic chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 concentration following ischemia reperfusion injury. These findings identify CR-AnxA12-48 as a new ALX agonist that regulates phagocyte responses and displays tissue-protective actions."
https://openalex.org/W2606356505,"ATTRV30M amyloid neuropathy is a lethal autosomal dominant sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy, caused by deposition of amyloid fibrils composed of aberrant transthyretin (TTR). Ages of onset and penetrance exhibit great variability and genetic factors have been implicated. Complement activation co-localizes with amyloid deposits in amyloidotic neuropathy and is possibly involved in the kinetics of amyloidogenesis. A candidate gene approach has recently identified C1q polymorphisms to correlate with disease onset in a Cypriot cohort of patients with ATTRV30M amyloid neuropathy. In the current study we use a double transgenic mouse model of ATTRV30M amyloid neuropathy in which C1q is ablated to elucidate further a possible modifier role for C1q. Amyloid deposition is found to be increased by 60% in the absence of C1q. Significant up regulation is also recorded in apoptotic and cellular stress markers reflecting extracellular toxicity of pre-fibrillar and fibrillar TTR. Our data further indicate that in the absence of C1q there is marked reduction of macrophages in association with amyloid deposits and thus less effective phagocytosis of TTR."
https://openalex.org/W2607153248,"Ocular toxoplasmosis is mediated by monocytes infected with Toxoplasma gondii that are disseminated to target organs. Although infected monocytes can easily access to outer blood-retinal barrier due to leaky choroidal vasculatures, not much is known about the effect of T. gondii-infected monocytes on outer blood-retinal barrier. We prepared human monocytes, THP-1, infected with T. gondii and human retinal pigment epithelial cells, ARPE-19, grown on transwells as an in vitro model of outer blood-retinal barrier. Exposure to infected monocytes resulted in disruption of tight junction protein, ZO-1, and decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance of retinal pigment epithelium. Supernatants alone separated from infected monocytes also decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and disrupted tight junction protein. Further investigation revealed that the supernatants could activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling in retinal pigment epithelium and the disruption was attenuated by FAK inhibitor. The disrupted barrier was partly restored by blocking CXCL8, a FAK activating factor secreted by infected monocytes. In this study, we demonstrated that monocytes infected with T. gondii can disrupt outer blood-retinal barrier, which is mediated by paracrinely activated FAK signaling. FAK signaling can be a target of therapeutic approach to prevent negative influence of infected monocytes on outer blood-retinal barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2607215837,"Marek’s disease virus is the etiological agent of a major lymphoproliferative disorder in poultry and the prototype of the Mardivirus genus. Primary avian somatic cells are currently used for virus replication and vaccine production, but they are largely refractory to any genetic modification compatible with the preservation of intact viral susceptibility. We explored the concept of induction of viral replication permissiveness in an established pluripotent chicken embryonic stem cell-line (cES) in order to derive a new fully susceptible cell-line. Chicken ES cells were not permissive for Mardivirus infection, but as soon as differentiation was triggered, replication of Marek’s disease virus was detected. From a panel of cyto-differentiating agents, hexamethylene bis (acetamide) (HMBA) was found to be the most efficient regarding the induction of permissiveness. These initial findings prompted us to analyse the effect of HMBA on gene expression, to derive a new mesenchymal cell line, the so-called ESCDL-1, and monitor its susceptibility for Mardivirus replication. All Mardiviruses tested so far replicated equally well on primary embryonic skin cells and on ESCDL-1, and the latter showed no variation related to its passage number in its permissiveness for virus infection. Viral morphogenesis studies confirmed efficient multiplication with, as in other in vitro models, no extra-cellular virus production. We could show that ESCDL-1 can be transfected to express a transgene and subsequently cloned without any loss in permissiveness. Consequently, ESCDL-1 was genetically modified to complement viral gene deletions thus yielding stable trans-complementing cell lines. We herein claim that derivation of stable differentiated cell-lines from cES cell lines might be an alternative solution to the cultivation of primary cells for virology studies."
https://openalex.org/W2605414771,"TCRγδ+ T-LGL leukemia is a rare form of chronic mature T cell disorders in elderly, which is generally characterized by a persistently enlarged CD3+CD57+TCRγδ+ large granular lymphocyte population in the peripheral blood with a monoclonal phenotype. Clinically, the disease is heterogeneous, most patients being largely asymptomatic, although neutropenia, fatigue and B symptoms and underlying diseases such as autoimmune diseases or malignancies are also often observed. The etiology of TCRγδ+ T-LGL proliferations is largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms of these rare proliferations by performing gene expression profiling of TCRγδ+ T-LGL versus normal TCRγδ+ T cell subsets. From our initial microarray dataset we observed that TCRγδ+ T-LGL leukemia forms a separate group when compared with different healthy control TCRγδ+ T cell subsets, correlating best with the healthy TemRA subset. The lowest correlation was seen with the naive subset. Based on specific comparison between healthy control cells and TCRγδ+ T-LGL leukemia cells we observed up-regulation of survival, proliferation and hematopoietic system related genes, with a remarkable down-regulation of apoptotic pathway genes. RQ-PCR validation of important genes representative for the dataset, including apoptosis (XIAP, CASP1, BCLAF1 and CFLAR), proliferation/development (ID3) and inflammation (CD28, CCR7, CX3CR1 and IFNG) processes largely confirmed the dysregulation in proliferation and apoptosis. Based on these expression data we conclude that TCRγδ+ T-LGL leukemia is likely the result of an underlying aberrant molecular mechanisms leading to increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2606137635,"Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, in particular myocardial dysfunction, which may lead to heart failure eventually. Understanding the electro-mechanics of the heart will help in developing more effective clinical treatments. In this paper, we present a multi-scale electro-mechanics model of the left ventricle (LV). The Holzapfel-Ogden constitutive law was used to describe the passive myocardial response in tissue level, a modified Grandi-Pasqualini-Bers model was adopted to model calcium dynamics in individual myocytes, and the active tension was described using the Niederer-Hunter-Smith myofilament model. We first studied the electro-mechanics coupling in a single myocyte in the healthy and diseased left ventricle, and then the single cell model was embedded in a dynamic LV model to investigate the compensation mechanism of LV pump function due to myocardial dysfunction caused by abnormality in cellular calcium dynamics. The multi-scale LV model was solved using an in-house developed hybrid immersed boundary method with finite element extension. The predictions of the healthy LV model agreed well with the clinical measurements and other studies, and likewise, the results in the failing states were also consistent with clinical observations. In particular, we found that a low level of intracellular Ca2+ transient in myocytes can result in LV pump function failure even with increased myocardial contractility, decreased systolic blood pressure, and increased diastolic filling pressure, even though they will increase LV stroke volume. Our work suggested that treatments targeted at increased contractility and lowering the systolic blood pressure alone are not sufficient in preventing LV pump dysfunction, restoring a balanced physiological Ca2+ handling mechanism is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2607415907,"Individuals within monogamous species form bonds that may buffer against the negative effects of stress on physiology and behavior. In some species, involuntary termination of the mother-offspring bond results in increased symptoms of negative affect in the mother, suggesting that the parent-offspring bond may be equally as important as the pair bond. To our knowledge, the extent to which affect in paternal rodents is altered by involuntary termination of the father-offspring bond is currently unknown. Here, we investigated to what extent separation and paternal experience alters passive stress-coping behaviors and dendritic morphology in hippocampal subfields of California mice (Peromyscus californicus). Irrespective of paternal experience, separated mice displayed shorter latencies to the first bout of immobility, longer durations of immobility, and more bouts of immobility than control (non-separated) mice. This effect of separation was exacerbated by paternal experience in some measures of behavioral despair—separation from offspring further decreased the latency to immobility and increased bouts of immobility. In the dentate gyrus, separation reduced dendritic spine density regardless of paternal experience. Increased spine density was observed on CA1 basal, but not apical, dendrites following paternal experience. Regardless of offspring presence, fatherhood was associated with reduced apical dendritic spine density in area CA3 of the hippocampus. Separation enhanced complexity of both basal and apical dendrites in CA1, while fatherhood reduced dendritic complexity in this region. Our data suggest that forced dissolution of the pair bond induces passive stress-coping behaviors and contributes to region-specific alterations in hippocampal structure in California mouse males."
https://openalex.org/W2605642643,"This study examined whether the recurrent difficulty to replicate results obtained with paradigms measuring distractor processing as a function of perceptual load is due to individual differences. We first reanalyzed, at the individual level, the data of eight previously reported experiments. These reanalyses revealed substantial inter-individual differences, with particularly low percentage of participants whose performance matched the load theory's predictions (i.e., larger distractor interference with low than high levels of load). Moreover, frequently the results were opposite to the theory's predictions-larger interference in the high than low load condition; and often a reversed compatibility effect emerged-better performance in the incompatible than neutral condition. Subsequently, seven observers participated in five identical experimental sessions. If the observed inter-individual differences are due to some stable trait or perceptual capacity, similar results should have emerged in all sessions of a given participant. However, all seven participants showed large between-sessions variations with similar patterns to those found between participants. These findings question the theoretical foundation implemented with these paradigms, as none of the theories suggested thus far can account for such inter- and intra-individual differences. Thus, these paradigms should be used with caution until further research will provide better understanding of what they actually measure."
https://openalex.org/W2606453297,"Depth image-based rendering (DIBR), which is used to render virtual views with a color image and the corresponding depth map, is one of the key techniques in the 2D to 3D conversion process. Due to the absence of knowledge about the 3D structure of a scene and its corresponding texture, DIBR in the 2D to 3D conversion process, inevitably leads to holes in the resulting 3D image as a result of newly-exposed areas. In this paper, we proposed a structure-aided depth map preprocessing framework in the transformed domain, which is inspired by recently proposed domain transform for its low complexity and high efficiency. Firstly, our framework integrates hybrid constraints including scene structure, edge consistency and visual saliency information in the transformed domain to improve the performance of depth map preprocess in an implicit way. Then, adaptive smooth localization is cooperated and realized in the proposed framework to further reduce over-smoothness and enhance optimization in the non-hole regions. Different from the other similar methods, the proposed method can simultaneously achieve the effects of hole filling, edge correction and local smoothing for typical depth maps in a united framework. Thanks to these advantages, it can yield visually satisfactory results with less computational complexity for high quality 2D to 3D conversion. Numerical experimental results demonstrate the excellent performances of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W2606309034,"Purpose To evaluate the effect of hypoxia on the neonatal pig retina and brain, we analysed the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and neurons in the superior colliculus, as well as the response of astrocytes in both these central nervous system (CNS) structures. Methods Newborn pigs were exposed to 120 minutes of hypoxia, induced by decreasing the inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2: 10–15%), followed by a reoxygenation period of 240 minutes (FiO2: 21–35%). RGCs were quantified using Brn3a, a specific nuclear marker for these cells, and apoptosis was assessed through the appearance of active caspase-3. A morphometric analysis of the cytoskeleton of astrocytes (identified with GFAP) was performed in both the retina and superior colliculus. Results Hypoxia produced no significant change in the RGCs, although, it did induce a 37.63% increase in the number of active caspase-3 positive cells in the superior colliculus. This increase was particularly evident in the superficial layers of the superior colliculus, where 56.93% of the cells were positive for active caspase-3. In addition, hypoxia induced changes in the morphology of the astrocytes in the superior colliculus but not in the retina. Conclusions Hypoxia in the neonatal pig does not affect the retina but it does affect more central structures in the brain, increasing the number of apoptotic cells in the superior colliculus and inducing changes in astrocyte morphology. This distinct sensibility to hypoxia may pave the way to design specific approaches to combat the effects of hypoxia in specific areas of the CNS."

In particular, we used two-dimensional (2D) Electron Microscopy (EM) images, image class averaging, homology modeling, Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) structure sampling, and fitting of models to images, to find the relative orientations of antibody domains that are consistent with the EM images. We revealed that the conformational preferences of the constructs depend on the extent of the hinge flexibility. We also quantified how the MET antigen impacts on the conformational dynamics of IgG4. These observations allow to create testable hypothesis to investigate MET biology. Our protocol may also help describe structural diversity of other antigen systems at approximately 5 Å precision, as quantified by Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD) among good-scoring models."
https://openalex.org/W2607153498,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis in China. Chemotherapy now is one of the most frequently used treatments for patients with ESCC in middle or late stage, however the effects were often limited by increased chemoresistance or treatment toxicity. So it is urgent to find new drugs to treat ESCC patients. Metformin with low cost and toxicity has proved to have anti-cancer effects in a numerous cancers, while its role and mechanism in ESCC has seldom been studied. In the present study, we found that metformin exhibited not only an anti-proliferation ability in a dose and time dependent manner but also a proapoptosis effect in a dose dependent manner in ESCC cell line KYSE450. Our in vivo experiment also showed that metformin markedly inhibited KYSE450 xenograft tumors growth compared to those treated with normal saline. What’s more, no obvious toxic reactions were observed. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we found that metformin treatment could significantly damp the expression of 4EBP1 and S6K1 in KYSE 450 cells in vitro and in vivo, furthermore, the p-4EBP1 and p-S6K1 expression in KYSE 450 cells were also inhibited greatly in vitro and in vivo. During the therapy of cancer, in order to overcome side effects, combination therapy was often used. In this paper, we demonstrated that metformin potentiated the effects of cisplatin via inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell apoptosis. Taken together, metformin owned the potential anti-cancer effect on ESCC in monotherapy or was combined with cisplatin and these results laid solid basis for the use of metformin in ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W2607215358,"Social influence drives human selection behaviours when numerous objects competing for limited attentions, which leads to the ‘rich get richer’ dynamics where popular objects tend to get more attentions. However, evidences have been found that, both the global information of the whole system and the local information among one’s friends have significant influence over the one’s selection. Consequently, a key question raises that, it is the local information or the global information more determinative for one’s selection? Here we compare the local-based influence and global-based influence. We show that, the selection behaviour is mainly driven by the local popularity of the objects while the global popularity plays a supplementary role driving the behaviour only when there is little local information for the user to refer to. Thereby, we propose a network model to describe the mechanism of user-object interaction evolution with social influence, where the users perform either local-driven or global-driven preferential attachments to the objects, i.e., the probability of an objects to be selected by a target user is proportional to either its local popularity or global popularity. The simulation suggests that, about 75% of the attachments should be driven by the local popularity to reproduce the empirical observations. It means that, at least in the studied context where users chose businesses on Yelp, there is a probability of 75% for a user to make a selection according to the local popularity. The proposed model and the numerical findings may shed some light on the study of social influence and evolving social systems."
https://openalex.org/W2606949762,"Idarubicin (IDR), cytarabine (AraC), and tamibarotene (Am80) are effective for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In acute leukemia, the incidence of venous thromboembolism or disseminated intravascular coagulation is associated with induction chemotherapy. Procoagulant effects of IDR, AraC, and Am80 were investigated in a vascular endothelial cell line EAhy926 and AML cell lines HL60 (AML M2), NB4 (AML M3, APL), and U937 (AML M5), focusing on tissue factor (TF), phosphatidylserine (PS), and thrombomodulin (TM). IDR induced procoagulant activity on the surface of vascular endothelial and AML cell lines. Expression of TF antigen, TM antigen, and PS were induced by IDR on the surface of each cell line, whereas expression of TF and TM mRNAs were unchanged. Conversely, Am80 decreased TF exposure and procoagulant activity, and increased TM exposure on NB4 cells. In NB4 cells, we observed downregulation of TF mRNA and upregulation of TM mRNA. These data suggest IDR may induce procoagulant activity in vessels by apoptosis through PS exposure and/or TF expression on vascular endothelial and AML cell lines. Am80 may suppress blood coagulation through downregulation of TF expression and induction of TM expression. Our methods could be useful to investigate changes in procoagulant activity induced by antineoplastic drugs."

In this study, we analysed data to positional therapy with regard to successful reduction of AHI and predictors of success.All consecutive patients undergoing polysomnography between 2007 and 2011 were analysed. We used a strict definition of positional sleep apnoea syndrome (supine-exclusive sleep apnoea syndrome) and of therapy used. Patients underwent polysomnography initially and during follow-up.1275 patients were evaluated, 112 of which had supine-exclusive sleep apnoea syndrome (AHI 5-66/h, median 13/h), 105 received positional therapy. With this treatment alone 75% (70/105) reached an AHI <5/h, in the follow-up 1 year later 37% (37/105) of these still had AHI<5/h, 46% (43/105) yielded an AHI between 5 and 10/h. Nine patient switched to APAP due to deterioration, 3 wanted to try APAP due to comfort reasons. At the last follow-up, 32% patients (34/105) were still on positional therapy with AHI <5/h. BMI was a predictor for successful reduction of AHI, but success was independent of sex, the presence of obstructive versus central sleep apnoea, severity of sleep apnoea syndrome or co-morbidities.Positional therapy may be a promising therapy option for patients with positional sleep apnoea. With appropriate adherence it yields a reasonable success rate in the clinical routine."
https://openalex.org/W2607463146,"Background To project the impact of partner reduction on preventing new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) under varying conditions of enhanced HIV testing and treatment (T&T) and condom use in Beijing, China. Methods and findings A complex network model was fitted to predict the number of new HIV infections averted from 2014 to 2023 under four scenarios of sexual behavior risk reduction (S)—S1: Male sexual partners decrease (reduced by a random value m from 1–50) while condom use increases (risk constant p is a random value between 0.2 and 1]); S2: Both sexual partners and condom use decrease (m 1, 50; p 1, 1.8); S3: Sexual partners reduce (m 1, 10) while condom use increases or decreases (p 0.2, 1.8); S4: Only MSM with ≥100 male sexual partners reduce their partners (m 1, 50) while condom use increases (p 0.2, 1). HIV prevalence will reach 23.2% by 2023 among Beijing MSM if T&T remains at the 2013 level. The three most influential factors are: T&T coverage; partner reduction (m); and the background risk (p). Under scenarios 1–4 of sexual behavioral changes with enhanced T&T interventions, the cumulative HIV new infections prevented over the 10 years will be 46.8% for S1 (interquartile range [IQR] 32.4%, 60.1%); 29.7% for S2 (IQR 18.0%, 41.4%), 23.2% for S3 (IQR 12.2%, 37.0%) and 11.6% for S4 (IQR 4.0%, 26.6%), respectively. The reproduction number R0 could drop below 1 if there were a substantial reduction of male sexual partners and/or expanded condom use. Conclusion Partner reduction is a vital factor within HIV combination interventions to reduce HIV incidence among Beijing MSM, with substantial additional benefits derived from condom use. T&T without substantial partner reduction and increased condom use is less promising unless its implementation were extremely (and improbably) efficient."
https://openalex.org/W2953057677,"A stochastic version of the Barkai-Leibler model of chemotaxis receptors in {\it E. coli} is studied here to elucidate the effects of intrinsic network noise in their conformational dynamics. It was originally proposed to explain the robust and near-perfect adaptation of {\it E. coli} observed across a wide range of spatially uniform attractant/repellent (ligand) concentrations. A receptor is either active or inactive and can stochastically switch between the two states. Enzyme CheR methylates inactive receptors while CheB demethylates active ones and the probability for it to be active depends on its level of methylation and ligandation. A simple version of the model with two methylation sites per receptor (M=2) shows zero-order ultrasensitivity (ZOU) akin to the classical 2-state model of covalent modification studied by Goldbeter and Koshland (GK). For extremely small and large ligand concentrations, the system reduces to two 2-state GK modules. A quantitative measure of the spontaneous fluctuations in activity (variance) estimated mathematically under linear noise approximation (LNA) is found to peak near the ZOU transition. The variance is a weak, non-monotonic and decreasing functions of ligand and receptor concentrations. Gillespie simulations for M=2 show excellent agreement with analytical results obtained under LNA. Numerical results for M=2, 3 and 4 show ZOU in mean activity; the variance is found to be smaller for larger M. The magnitude of receptor noise deduced from available experimental data is consistent with our predictions. A simple analysis of the downstream signaling pathway shows that this noise is large enough to have a beneficial effect on the motility of the organism. The response of mean receptor activity to small time-dependent changes in the external ligand concentration, computed within linear response theory, is found to have a bilobe form."
https://openalex.org/W2606640839,"The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has a haploid genome in which two thirds of the DNA encodes proteins. Consequently, the space available for selfish mobile elements to expand without excess damage to the host genome is limited. The non-long terminal repeat retrotransposon TRE5-A maintains an active population in the D. discoideum genome and apparently adapted to this gene-dense environment by targeting positions ~47 bp upstream of tRNA genes that are devoid of protein-coding regions. Because only ~24% of tRNA genes are associated with a TRE5-A element in the reference genome, we evaluated whether TRE5-A retrotransposition is limited to this subset of tRNA genes. We determined that a tagged TRE5-A element (TRE5-Absr) integrated at 384 of 405 tRNA genes, suggesting that expansion of the current natural TRE5-A population is not limited by the availability of targets. We further observed that TRE5-Absr targets the ribosomal 5S gene on the multicopy extrachromosomal DNA element that carries the ribosomal RNA genes, indicating that TRE5-A integration may extend to the entire RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcriptome. We determined that both natural TRE5-A and cloned TRE5-Absr retrotranspose to locations on the extrachromosomal rDNA element that contain tRNA gene-typical A/B box promoter motifs without displaying any other tRNA gene context. Based on previous data suggesting that TRE5-A targets tRNA genes by locating Pol III transcription complexes, we propose that A/B box loci reflect Pol III transcription complex assembly sites that possess a function in the biology of the extrachromosomal rDNA element."

Use of predictable food sources and reliance on human-produced resources are well-known trait in long-range feeders like albatrosses and petrels. Breeding Buller's albatrosses studied at Solander I. (Hautere), New Zealand fed their chicks the remains of sooty shearwater juveniles (tītī in Māori), which are harvested from nearby muttonbirding sites. Evidence of this food type was found at over 10% of nests examined, and 17-40% birds that were fitted with GPS loggers visited muttonbirding sites in this and previous studies. Muttonbirding is a traditional practice that has continued for centuries, with up to 120 tonnes of offal discharged to the sea annually during the present day harvest. It coincides with the energetically-demanding early chick period for the albatrosses. Our finding suggests that the offal may be an important, but overlooked element in the albatross diet. As an important supplementary food for the albatrosses it is likely to have contributed to the 3% per annum growth of their populations since the first comprehensive population surveys in 1969."

The conversion is problematic when the system of linear constraints is degenerate. This paper describes a conversion algorithm that combines the best of two methods: the incremental slicing of cones that defeats degeneracy and pivoting for a swift traversal of the set of extreme points. An extensive computational practice uncovers two complementary classes of conversion problems. The two classes are distinguished by a practical measure of complexity that involves the input and output sizes. Detailed characterizations of the complexity classes and the corresponding performances of the algorithm are presented. For the benefit of implementors, a simple example illustrates the stages of the exposition."
https://openalex.org/W2604912885,"Current research in prosthetic device design aims to mimic natural movements using a feedback system that connects to the patient's own nerves to control the device. The first step in using neurons to control motion is to make and maintain contact between neurons and the feedback sensors. Therefore, the goal of this project was to determine if changes in electrode resistance could be detected when a neuron extended a neurite to contact a sensor. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were harvested from chick embryos and cultured on a collagen-coated carbon nanotube microelectrode array for two days. The DRG were seeded along one side of the array so the processes extended across the array, contacting about half of the electrodes. Electrode resistance was measured both prior to culture and after the two day culture period. Phase contrast images of the microelectrode array were taken after two days to visually determine which electrodes were in contact with one or more DRG neurite or tissue. Electrodes in contact with DRG neurites had an average change in resistance of 0.15 MΩ compared with the electrodes without DRG neurites. Using this method, we determined that resistance values can be used as a criterion for identifying electrodes in contact with a DRG neurite. These data are the foundation for future development of an autonomous feedback resistance measurement system to continuously monitor DRG neurite outgrowth at specific spatial locations."

The Grand Finale, as NASA is calling the forays, should help answer questions about Saturn9s atmosphere and interior. But most of all, it should end a debate about the mass of the water ice rings, which is a big clue to their age—whether they are 4.5 billion years old, nearly as old as the planet, or much younger."
https://openalex.org/W2607348451,"In 2005, NASA9s Cassini spacecraft spied jets of water ice and vapor erupting into space from fissures on Enceladus, evidence of a salty ocean beneath the saturnian moon9s placid icy surface. Now, it turns out that the jets contain hydrogen gas, a sign of ongoing reactions on the floor of that alien sea, according to a new study published this week in Science . Because such chemistry provides energy for microbial life on Earth, the discovery makes Enceladus the top candidate for hosting life elsewhere in the solar system."
https://openalex.org/W2606819888,"As the 22 April March for Science in Washington, D.C., and some 400 sister marches around the world approach, march organizers are already looking toward next steps. For almost 3 months, a team of volunteer coordinators, most of whom have yet to meet in person, have been working around the clock to inspire supporters, negotiate partnerships with dozens of science groups, and raise enough money to pull off their upcoming event. March organizers admit they don't know what they'll find at the end of their exhausting sprint. They are uncertain of how many marchers will appear, and how the demonstrations will be received. But they see march day as a beginning, not an end, as March for Science tries to pivot from being an event organizer to becoming a lasting force for science advocacy."
