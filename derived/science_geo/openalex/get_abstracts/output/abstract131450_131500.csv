https://openalex.org/W2113559242,"Autosomal dominant oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an adult-onset disease with a world-wide distribution1. It usually presents in the sixth decade with progressive swallowing difficulties (dysphagia), eyelid drooping (ptosis) and proximal limb weakness. Unique nuclear filament inclusions in skeletal muscle fibres are its pathological hallmark2. We isolated the poly(A) binding protein 2 gene (PABP2) from a 217-kb candidate interval on chromosome 14q11 (B.B. et al., manuscript submitted). A (GCG)6 repeat encoding a polyalanine tract located at the N terminus of the protein was expanded to (GCG)8–13 in the 144 OPMD families screened. More severe phenotypes were observed in compound heterozygotes for the (GCG)9 mutation and a (GCG)7 allele that is found in 2% of the population, whereas homozygosity for the (GCG)7 allele leads to autosomal recessive OPMD. Thvs the (GCG)7 allele is an example of a polymorphism which can act either as a modifier of a dominant phe-notype or as a recessive mutation. Pathological expansions of the polyalanine tract may cause mutated PABP2 oligomers to accumulate as filament inclusions in nuclei."

https://openalex.org/W2093214731,"Between 2 and 5% of children who are otherwise unimpaired have significant difficulties in acquiring expressive and/or receptive language, despite adequate intelligence and opportunity. While twin studies indicate a significant role for genetic factors in developmental disorders of speech and language, the majority of families segregating such disorders show complex patterns of inheritance, and are thus not amenable for conventional linkage analysis. A rare exception is the KE family, a large three-generation pedigree in which approximately half of the members are affected with a severe speech and language disorder which appears to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant monogenic trait. This family has been widely publicised as suffering primarily from a defect in the use of grammatical suffixation rules, thus supposedly supporting the existence of genes specific to grammar. The phenotype, however, is broader in nature, with virtually every aspect of grammar and of language affected. In addition, affected members have a severe orofacial dyspraxia, and their speech is largely incomprehensible to the naive listener. We initiated a genome-wide search for linkage in the KE family and have identified a region on chromosome 7 which co-segregates with the speech and language disorder (maximum lod score = 6.62 at theta = 0.0), confirming autosomal dominant inheritance with full penetrance. Further analysis of microsatellites from within the region enabled us to fine map the locus responsible (designated SPCH1) to a 5.6-cM interval in 7q31, thus providing an important step towards its identification. Isolation of SPCH1 may offer the first insight into the molecular genetics of the developmental process that culminates in speech and language."

The aim of this study was to investigate the intracellular pathways linked to VEGF/NO-induced endothelial cell proliferation. We assessed the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) that is specifically activated by growth factors, extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK½), on cultured microvascular endothelium isolated from coronary postcapillary venules. ERK½ was immunoprecipitated, and its activity was assessed with an immunocomplex kinase assay. In endothelial cells exposed for 5 min to the NO donor drug sodium nitroprusside at a concentration of 100 μm, ERK½ activity significantly increased. VEGF produced a time- and concentration-dependent activation of ERK½. Maximal activity was obtained after 5 min of stimulation at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. The specific MAPK kinase inhibitor PD 98059 abolished ERK½ activation and endothelial cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner in response to VEGF and sodium nitroprusside. The NO synthase inhibitorN ω-monomethyl-l-arginine, as well as the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, blocked the activation of ERK½ induced by VEGF, suggesting that NO and cGMP contributed to the VEGF-dependent ERK½ activation. These results demonstrate for the first time that kinase-derivative receptor activation triggers the NO synthase/guanylate cyclase pathway to activate the MAPK cascade and substantiates the hypothesis that the activation of ERK½ is necessary for VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation.

VEGF has been shown to elevate intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and calcium levels and to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation and von Willebrand factor release in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (11Brock T.A. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF effects on permeability (12Wu H.M. Qiaobing H. Yuan Y. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2735-H2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and vascular tone (13Ku D.D. Zaleski J.K. Liu S. Brock T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H586-H592PubMed Google Scholar) are coupled to nitric oxide (NO) production. Consistent with this observation, we have recently demonstrated that NO production and cGMP elevation contribute to the angiogenic effect of VEGF (14Morbidelli L. Chang C.-H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Choudhuri R. Zhang H.-T. Donnini S. Granger H.J. Bicknell R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2526-2534Crossref Google Scholar). The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade by VEGF has been recently demonstrated (16D'Angelo G. Struman I. Martial J. Weiner R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6374-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). MAPKs are important intermediates in signal transduction pathways that are stimulated by a variety of agents, such as growth factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, and physical and chemical stressing agents (17Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). Many receptor tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to activate the MAPKs. The 44- and 42-kDa MAPK (ERK½) isoforms are ubiquitously expressed and have been shown to be activated by dual specificity MAPK kinases (MEK1/MEK2) in response to diverse stimuli (18Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar,19Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study was designed to characterize the transducing pathways underlying VEGF-activated endothelial cell proliferation. Recently, we have shown that NO is a downstream signal in VEGF effects (15Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Choudhuri R. Zhang H.-T. Donnini S. Granger H.J. Bicknell R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2526-2534Crossref Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated the role of NO on the intracellular pathway linked to VEGF receptor activation in postcapillary endothelium. We assessed MAPK activity specifically activated by a growth factor, i.e. ERK½, on cultured endothelium isolated from coronary postcapillary venules. Coronary venular endothelial cells (CVECs) were obtained and maintained in culture as described previously and characterized for their endothelial morphology by immunofluorescent staining for factor VIII antigen and uptake of acetylated low density lipoproteins (20Schelling M.E. Meininger C.J. Hawker J.R. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: H1211-H1217PubMed Google Scholar). Cells between passages 15 and 25 were used in these experiments. Cell proliferation was quantified by total cell number after 48 h of stimulation with test substances (14Morbidelli L. Chang C.-H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of the MAPKK, NO synthase (NOS), and guanylate cyclase inhibitors, the drugs were added to the cells 30 min before the test substances. Proliferation is expressed as mean ± S.E. of total cells counted in each well. CVECs were serum starved overnight. Following treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by adding 0.3 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.2 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm NaF. To assess the calcium dependence of ERK½ activation, CVECs were stimulated in the presence of 3 mmEGTA. Cell lysate containing 100 μg of protein in a total volume of 800 μl were precleared with nonimmune rabbit IgG and 30 μl of goat anti-rabbit IgG agarose beads on a rotating plate for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. 1 μg of anti-ERK1 polyclonal antibody, which is reactive with ERK1 and to a lesser extent with ERK2, and 25 μl of goat anti-rabbit IgG agarose beads were added to the supernatant, and the mixture was placed on a rotating plate overnight at 4 °C. Following a centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 5 min, the pellet was recovered and washed twice with the lysis buffer and once with the kinase buffer containing 20 mmHepes (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase assay was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min in 30 μl of assay buffer containing 5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) as specific substrate for ERK½ (21Erickson A.K. Payne D.M. Martino P.A. Rossomando A.J. Shabanowitz J. Weber M.J. Hunt D.F. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19728-19735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 20 μm ATP, and 3 μCi of [γ32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and exhaustively destained. The gel was dried, and the incorporation of [γ32P]ATP was visualized by autoradiography. Gel slices of the 20-kDa MBP bands were also cut out in most of the experiments, and their radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. CVECs seeded onto 6-well plates (3 × 104 cells/well) after overnight incubation were labeled with [3H]myoinositol (2 μCi/ml) in DMEM without cold inositol for 48 h. Excess of tritiated myoinositol was removed by three washes with cold DMEM followed by 4 h of incubation with cold DMEM at 37 °C. After one wash, cells were incubated for 10 min with 20 mm LiCl to block myoinositol-1-phosphatase and then with test compounds for the designed times. Reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold methanol for 30 min. Cells were scraped, and cell-associated inositols were extracted by chloroform-methanol (1:1). Water-soluble fractions were applied to anion-exchange columns (Resin AG-X8, 200–400 mesh, formate form), and water-soluble inositols were eluted by successive washes with 60 mm CH5NO2 + 5 mm B4Na2O7·10 H2O, 200 mm CH5NO2 + 0.1 m CH2O2, and 1.2 mCH5NO2 + 0.1 mCH2O2. Inositol phosphate 1 levels were measured as recovered radioactivity. Cytosolic calcium measurements were made using the calcium-sensitive fluorescence indicator indo-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (22Ziche M. Zawieja D. Hester R.K. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H569-H580PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with the acetoxymethyl ester for the dye in DMEM containing 1% Me2SO for 40 min. At that time, the cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and reincubated in DMEM without Me2SO, dye, or phenol red for 20 min to allow for de-esterification. The experiments were performed on a stage-scanning photometric imaging system (ACAS 570, Meridian Instruments, Okemos, MI) at 37 °C. The cells were illuminated with the 355-nm line of an argon laser that was attenuated with neutral density filters and an acuosto-optic modulator to minimize bleaching. Fluorescence emission was monitored at 405 and 485 nm using narrow-band pass filters and dual photomultipliers. The fluorescent images of a suitable field of cells were captured before and after addition of VEGF, and the 405/485 nm ratio was analyzed. This ratio is a direct index to the calcium concentration within the cell at the time of image capture. Subconfluent and serum-starved cells were stimulated for 4–24 h with VEGF in the presence of 1% serum. At the end of incubation, total RNA was isolated by the standard guanidine thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (23Chomczynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthetized as described (24Ziche M. Parenti A. Ledda F. Dell'Era P. Granger H.J. Maggi C.A. Presta M. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Differential reverse transcription PCR for NOS isoforms was carried out by using 5 μl of cDNA and specific primers for bovine calcium/calmodulin-dependent NOS (ecNOS) and iNOS with sequences as follows: ecNOS sense, 5′-GCTTGAGACCCTCAGTCAGG-3′; ecNOS antisense, 5′-GGTCTCCAGTCTTGAGCTGG-3′ (25Ranjan V. Xiao Z. Diamond S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H550-H555PubMed Google Scholar); iNOS sense, 5′-TAGAGGAACATCTGGCCAGG-3′; iNOS antisense, 5′-TGGCAGGGTCCCCTCTGATG-3′ (26Adler H. Frech B. Thony M. Pfister H. Peterhans E. Jungi T.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4710-4718PubMed Google Scholar). Calibration was performed by co-amplification of the same cDNA samples with primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal standard, with sequences as described (24Ziche M. Parenti A. Ledda F. Dell'Era P. Granger H.J. Maggi C.A. Presta M. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For PCR amplification a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400 was used. The PCR cycles were as follows: 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. After 30 cycles of amplification, aliquots of each sample product (20 μl) were electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The size of the amplification products was 296 for ecNOS and 372 for iNOS. Image processing and analysis of the intensity of the bands were performed as described (24Ziche M. Parenti A. Ledda F. Dell'Era P. Granger H.J. Maggi C.A. Presta M. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Results were evaluated as ratio between the target genes (ecNOS and iNOS) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplification analysis. Subconfluent CVECs in 60 -mm culture dishes were serum starved overnight and then washed and equilibrated for 20 min at 37 °C with Hepes buffer containing: 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated for 20 min with 1 μCi of [3H]arginine plus 10 μm l-arginine. To assess the calcium dependence of NOS activation, experiments were performed in calcium-free Hepes buffer containing 1 mm EGTA. Test substances were added for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by cold Hepes buffer containing 4 mm EDTA, and the supernatant was removed. 0.5 ml of ethanol added to each monolayer was allowed to evaporate, and 2 ml of 10 mm Hepes-Na, pH 5.5, was added for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and applied to 0.8 ml of Dowex AG50WX-8 (Na-form) and vigorously shaken for 45 min. Then, 0.5 ml was collected and added to 3 ml of liquid scintillation counting mixture. NOS activity was expressed as pmol/mg of protein. cGMP levels were measured on cell extracts from confluent cell monolayers by radioimmunoassay using iodinated tracer (14Morbidelli L. Chang C.-H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were treated with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-5-methyl-xanthine for 15 min before stimulation. After stimulation, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and removed by scraping in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Following centrifugation, cGMP levels were assayed in the supernatant, and proteins were measured in the pellet by the Bradford's procedure. Data are expressed as fmol/mg of protein. Fetal calf serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Purified rabbit IgG, anti-rabbit IgG agarose beads, myelin basic protein, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), l-NMMA, dithiothreitol, BCA kit, and all reagents for cell culture were purchased from Sigma. Diff-Quik was from Mertz-Dade AG (Dudingen, Switzerland). Human recombinant VEGF and PD 98059 ([2-(2′-amino-3′-methoxyphenyl)-oxanaphthalen-4-one]) were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem International (San Diego, CA). [γ32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. Rabbit anti-ERK½ polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Acrylamide, TEMED, ammonium persulfate, and Coomassie Brilliant Blue were from Bio-Rad. 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) was purchased from Tocris Cookson Ltd., (Langford, United Kingdom). Mononucleotides dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP and the DNA marker VIII were from Boehringer Mannheim. Reverse transcriptase, oligo(dT)16, AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, and primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and NOS isoforms were from Perkin-Elmer. The ability of VEGF to stimulate the MAPK cascade was assessed. After 24 h of starvation, CVECs were stimulated with 10 ng/ml VEGF over a range of times from 2 to 15 min, and the activity of the immunoprecipitated ERK½ was measured. The activation of ERK½ was statistically higher than the unstimulated control within 2 min and reached the maximum at 5 min (Fig. 1 a). The activation of ERK½ by VEGF was concentration-dependent with maximal activity at 10 ng/ml, which doubled the basal activity of ERK½ (Fig. 1, b and d). In the same experiments, bFGF (10 ng/ml) did not significantly induce ERK½ activation. When the endothelial cells were preincubated for 30 min with increasing concentrations of the MAPKK inhibitor PD 98059 (27Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar), VEGF-induced ERK½ activation was inhibited (IC50 = 30 μm). At 100 μm, PD 98059 completely abolished the ERK½ activation produced by 10 ng/ml of VEGF but did not modify the unstimulated control (Fig. 1, c and e). In previous reports, we demonstrated that the NO pathway is necessary for the proliferative effects of VEGF on microvascular endothelial cells (14Morbidelli L. Chang C.-H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether NO contributed to VEGF mitogenic activity by activating the MAPK cascade. For this purpose, starved and subconfluent CVECs were treated with the NO donor SNP, and the activity of ERK½ was measured. After 5 min of stimulation with 100 μm SNP, the MAPK activity was increased by 2-fold (Fig.2 a). NO-induced ERK½ activation and the proliferative effect of NO were abolished by PD 98059 (Fig. 2, a and b), indicating that ERK½ was specifically and directly activated by NO and that this phosphorylation cascade was involved in signaling mitogenesis in postcapillary endothelial cells. We then characterized the NOS isoform mediating VEGF effect in CVECs. The rapid activation of ERK½ in response to VEGF suggested that the acute activation of NO production in CVECs by ecNOS. Differential reverse transcription PCR of total RNA indicated that this isoform was predominantly expressed in CVECs (Fig.3 a). After 4 h from VEGF administration, ecNOS expression was not modified, indicating the absence of a transcriptional event between VEGF administration and NO production. iNOS expression was not detected at any time point between 4 and 24 h of exposure to the growth factor. CVECs preloaded with the ratiometric fluorescent indicator indo-1 exhibited a rapid calcium transient upon exposure to VEGF (Fig.3 b). The upward stroke of the calcium transient began 3 min after addition of VEGF, the peak concentration of cytosolic calcium occurred at approximately 7 min, and recovery occurred over the next 20 min. After continued exposure of CVECs to VEGF for 70 min, cytosolic calcium had recovered only 65%, suggesting a continuing signal for calcium-calmodulin NO production beyond the rapid peak. Consistent with the rapid cytosolic calcium elevation, within 5 min after VEGF exposure, NOS activity increased, and EGTA abolished its elevation (Fig. 3 c). EGTA also abolished ERK½ activation by VEGF, suggesting that calcium was required to trigger the MAPK cascade, as well as the NOS activity (Fig.3 d). The role of ERK½ phosphorylation and of the NOS/cyclic GMP cascade in the VEGF/NO-induced endothelial cell proliferation was assessed on endothelial cells treated with either the MAPKK inhibitor PD 98059 (1–100 μm), the NOS inhibitor l-NMMA (1–200 μm) (28Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5758) Google Scholar), or the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (0.1–10 μm) (29Garthwaite J. Southam E. Boulton C.L. Nielsen E.B. Scmidt K. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 184-188PubMed Google Scholar). The MAPKK inhibitor specifically reduced the proliferative effect of VEGF in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas it did not inhibit the growth-promoting effect of bFGF (Fig.4 a). The IC50 for growth inhibition (10 μm) was in the same range of concentration as that for ERK½ inhibition. At the highest concentration, PD 98059 slightly reduced the number of cells recovered under control conditions. The effect was independent from cytotoxicity, as indicated by trypan blue exclusion assays (data not shown). The addition of VEGF doubled cGMP levels in CVECs, an effect specifically blocked by NOS inhibitors (TableI) as previously reported (14Morbidelli L. Chang C.-H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F.

Conversely, no inhibition in cell growth was produced when bFGF was used as a mitogen (Fig.4 b).Table IEffect of the NOS, guanylate cyclase, and MAPKK inhibitors on cGMP levelsTreatmentcGMP levelsBasalVEGFSNPNone44 ± 885 ± 1490 ± 10l-NMMA, 1 μm50 ± 880 ± 10ND1-aND, not done.l-NMMA, 100 μm48 ± 651 ± 51-bP < 0.05 versus VEGF or SNP alone.NDl-NMMA, 200 μm42 ± 546 ± 31-bP < 0.05 versus VEGF or SNP alone.ND+l-Arg, 500 μmND84 ± 15NDODQ, 0.1 μm51 ± 1174 ± 3110 ± 2ODQ, 1 μm49 ± 1348 ± 161-bP < 0.05 versus VEGF or SNP alone.45 ± 51-bP < 0.05 versus VEGF or SNP alone.ODQ, 10 μm39 ± 540 ± 121-bP < 0.05 versus VEGF or SNP alone.30 ± 141-bP < 0.05 versus VEGF or SNP alone.PD 98059, 1 μm56 ± 1592 ± 1282 ± 12PD 98059, 10 μm48 ± 1084 ± 1588 ± 10PD 98059, 100 μm60 ± 880 ± 878 ± 121-a ND, not done.1-b P < 0.05 versus VEGF or SNP alone. Open table in a new tab ODQ produced concentration-dependent inhibition of the guanylate cyclase activation and cGMP levels elevation induced by VEGF as well as by the NO donor SNP (maximal effect at 10 μm; IC50 = 0.5 μm) (Table I). The minimal effective concentration of ODQ that inhibited cGMP formation was sufficient to block the proliferative effect of VEGF, and lower concentrations gave the same effect (Fig. 4 c). Conversely, proliferation and cGMP elevation produced by the NO donor SNP were reduced by ODQ in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4 c and Table I). Maximal inhibition was obtained at 10 μm, and the IC50 was 0.5 μm for both the effects. The guanylate cyclase inhibitor did not produce significant reduction of bFGF-induced growth (Fig. 4 c). To demonstrate the exact biochemical location of the MAPK in the NO/NOS pathway in our system, the MAPKK inhibitor was tested on guanylate cyclase activation. PD 98059 did not affect the NOS/cGMP pathway activation stimulated by either VEGF or SNP on CVECs at any of the concentrations tested (TableI). Similar results were obtained when PD 98095 was assessed on NOS activity. The VEGF-induced NOS activity (223 ± 11 pmol/mg of protein versus a basal value of 169 ± 15 pmol/mg of protein) could be selectively blocked by 3 μm l-NMMA (131 ± 10 pmol/mg of protein; IC50= 50 μm) but not by 100 μm PD 98059 (210 ± 22 pmol/mg of protein; n = 3). The possibility that PD 98059 could affect other transducing pathways required for proliferation in our system was ruled out in parallel experiments in which inositol phosphate metabolism was assessed. PD 98059 at the concentration producing 100% reduction of the specific biochemical target (ERK½ activation) failed to affect the metabolism of inositol phosphate. VEGF induced inositol phosphate 1 accumulation (448 ± 37 cpm/well over basal control), which was not affected by 100 μm PD 98059 pretreatment (642 ± 98 cpm/well; n = 3). To investigate the exact location of the NOS/cGMP pathway in the phosphorylation cascade triggered by VEGF in our system, experiments were done to assess the involvement of NO pathway in VEGF-induced ERK½ activation. CVECs were pretreated for 30 min with 200 μm l-NMMA and then stimulated for 5 min with 10 ng/ml VEGF. Data obtained showed that the pretreatment with l-NMMA abolished the increased ERK½ activity elicited by VEGF (Fig.5 a). This effect was selective for the VEGF effect because no inhibition was found for cells stimulated with 10% calf serum (1680 ± 70 cpm and 1725 ± 150 cpm, with and without l-NMMA, respectively;n = 3). Consistent with the observation that NO is the transducing molecule between the VEGF receptor and ERK½, ODQ significantly inhibited the VEGF- and SNP-induced increase of ERK½ activity (Fig. 5 b). The data presented here demonstrate that the mitogenic activity of VEGF on postcapillary endothelial cells requires the activation of the MAPK cascade and that NO/cGMP production mediates the MAPK activation following VEGF receptor interaction, ultimately leading to endothelial cell growth. These conclusions are based on the following observations: 1) VEGF stimulated the MAPK specifically linked to proliferation, i.e. ERK½, as did the NO-donor drug SNP; 2) blockade of the NO pathway by l-NMMA and by ODQ prevented the ERK½ activation by VEGF and SNP; and 3) inhibition of MAPK kinase activation, of NO synthase activity, and of cGMP production specifically blocked VEGF/NO-induced proliferation. In rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, it was reported that VEGF stimulated phosphorylation of the MAPK (16D'Angelo G. Struman I. Martial J. Weiner R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6374-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Postcapillary venular endothelium has the ability to respond promptly to mitogenic peptides. Using cultured endothelium from coronary postcapillary venules, we demonstrated that ERK½ activation lies upstream of the proliferative effect of VEGF. The specificity of ERK½ activation is confirmed by the use of the MAPKK (or MEK) inhibitor PD 98059 (27Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). This compound has been demonstrated to be a selective and noncompetitive MEK inhibitor in in vitro assay (30Alessi D.R. Cuenda A.

Sci. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (515) Google Scholar) without any effect on ERK. PD 98059 at concentrations above 50 μm has been shown both to inhibit MEK½ by binding a regulatory site on the enzyme and to prevent activation by c-Raf and MEK½ kinase (30Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). Our data show that in this concentration range, PD 98059 prevented the ERK½ activation and the proliferative effect induced by VEGF, demonstrating that the activation of ERK½ is a necessary step for endothelial cell proliferation. In previous work, we have shown that molecules able to increase NO levels induced endothelial cells proliferation and migration in vivo and in vitro (32Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Masini E. Granger H.J. Geppetti P. Ledda F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 33Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Masini E. Amerini S. Granger H.J. Maggi C.A. Geppetti P. Ledda F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2036-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) and also that the activation of the NO pathway following VEGF stimulation significantly contributed to the mitogenic effect of VEGF (14Morbidelli L. Chang C.-H. Douglas J.G. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H411-H415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that under the same experimental conditions, NO directly triggers the activation of the MAPK cascade. ERK½ activation and endothelial cell proliferation promoted by NO are selectively blocked by the MAPKK inhibitor. ODQ, a selective and specific inhibitor of the soluble guanylate cyclase (29Garthwaite J. Southam E. Boulton C.L. Nielsen E.B. Scmidt K. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 184-188PubMed Google Scholar), blocked in a concentration-dependent manner cGMP elevation in venular endothelial cells exposed to the NO donor and to VEGF. Consistent with cGMP being required to transduce the NO-dependent proliferation signal, neither VEGF or SNP promoted ERK½ phosphorylation and growth in the presence of ODQ. The IC50 for proliferation and cGMP formation overlapped when SNP was the mitogen. Interestingly, minimal reduction of cGMP levels was sufficient to completely block the proliferation signal produced by VEGF. Because in our experimental model, production of cGMP is required for VEGF-induced cell adhesion (15Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Choudhuri R. Zhang H.-T. Donnini S. Granger H.J. Bicknell R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2526-2534Crossref Google Scholar), the effect of ODQ on VEGF proliferation might be related to the specific requirement of cell adhesion to fulfill the growth program encoded by VEGF in postcapillary venular endothelium. The link between VEGF stimulation of CVECs, NO release, and the rapid activation of ERK appears to be ecNOS, the calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme found in endothelial cells. ecNOS is the predominant isoform expressed in CVECs, and its expression is not affected by the growth factor. We show that VEGF causes a rise in cytoplasmic calcium that peaks at 7 min and triggers NOS activity within 5–10 min. Consistently, ERK½ activity peaks between 5 and 10 min. Thus, the time frame for increases in cytosolic calcium, NO production, and ERK½ activity support a KDR/calcium/ecNOS/NO/soluble guanylate cyclase/cGMP/ERK½ cascade activated by VEGF. The mechanism responsible for the calcium transient is not completely clear. However, as indicated by the elevation of inositol phosphate levels recovered in CVECs, release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum could occur by KDR-mediated activation of phospholipase C gamma 1 (34Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Alternatively, VEGF may activate processes that accelerate calcium entry via plasmalemmal ion channels (35Bates D.O. Curry F.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: H2520-H2528Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that NO synthase lies downstream of the angiogenesis induced by VEGF but not of that induced by bFGF (15Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Choudhuri R. Zhang H.-T. Donnini S. Granger H.J. Bicknell R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2526-2534Crossref Google Scholar). The present data provide a new insight on the mechanism underlying the role of NO in mediating VEGF effect by demonstrating that the NO pathway is upstream of the MAPK cascade activated by VEGF. In fact, the ERK½ activation and the endothelial proliferation following VEGF/receptor activation are prevented in culture conditions in which NO production and cGMP elevation are impaired by the use of NOS/cGMP selective inhibitors. Conversely, blockade of the MAPKK does not affect the NOS/guanylate cyclase. Thus, the NO pathway activation is intermediate between the VEGF receptor activation and the MAPK phosphorylation in endothelial cells. Other observations support a link between the NO and the MAPK cascade. Sing et al. (36Sing K. Balligand J.-L. Fisher T.A. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) recently described that ERK activation is necessary for the induction of the inducible NOS by interleukin-1β in myocytes and cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Elevated shear rate caused increased production of NO and activated the MAPK cascade in endothelial cells (37Buga G.M. Gold M.E. Fukuto J.M. Ignarro L.J. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 38Pearce M.J. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Whatley R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Whereas in the above mentioned reports, MAPK activation anticipates and/or parallels NO production, our data indicate an upstream role for NO. The role of NO in promoting cell growth and differentiation is controversial. In angiogenesis, NO elevation has been shown to be positively correlated with neovascularization and tumor growth (15Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Choudhuri R. Zhang H.-T. Donnini S. Granger H.J.

Conversely, in the chorionallantoic membrane of the chick embryo and during the developmental maturation of Drosophila, NO acts as an antiproliferative agent (41Pipili-Synetos E. Papageorgiou A.

Enikolopov G. Cell. 1996; 87: 639-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). ERK½ is thought to be directly involved in transmitting signals from growth factor receptors to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription and protein synthesis, leading to proliferation or differentiation and apoptosis (17Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar, 43Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Recently, a difference in the actions of the ERK and p38/JNK pathway has been demonstrated in PC12 cells; the activation of JNK-p38 cascade leads to apoptosis of PC12 cells, whereas the activation of ERK½ seems to be necessary for survival and/or antiapoptosis of PC12 cells (45Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). The data here reported support the hypothesis of NO as a “prosurvival” or antiapoptotic effector for endothelial cells. Although it is presently difficult to speculate on whether the opposing effects of NO in controlling cell growth are due to species or to differentiation diversity, nevertheless our results using venular endothelial cells continue to emphasize the importance of NO as a balancing element in the molecular events between cell proliferation and differentiation."

In this study, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to reveal expression of various CXC and CC chemokine receptors in human umbilical vein EC. Northern analysis showed that CXCR4 was selectively expressed in vascular EC, but not in smooth muscle cells. Compared with other chemokines, stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), the known CXCR4 ligand, was an efficacious chemoattractant for EC, causing the migration of ∼40% input cells with an EC50 of 10–20 nm. Of the chemokines tested, only SDF-1α induced a rapid, though variable mobilization of intracellular Ca2+in EC. Experiments with actinomycin D demonstrated that CXCR4 transcripts were short-lived, indicating a rapid mRNA turnover. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) caused a pronounced down-regulation of CXCR4 mRNA in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In a striking functional correlation, IFN-γ treatment also attenuated the chemotactic response of EC to SDF-1α. IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and lipopolysaccharide produced a time course-dependent biphasic effect on CXCR4 transcription. Expression of CXCR4 in EC is significant, more so as it and several CC chemokine receptors have been shown to serve as fusion co-receptors along with CD4 during human immunodeficiency virus infection. Taken together, these findings provide evidence of chemokine receptor expression in EC and offer an explanation for the action of chemokines like SDF-1α on the vascular endothelium.

The vascular endothelium is strategically located to play a prominent sensory and effector cell role in the maintenance of hemostasis, and during the vascular response to inflammation, infection, and injury (1Pober J.S.

In line with their well defined role as mediators of diapedesis, the chemokine receptors have been primarily localized on neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils (5Ben-Baruch A.

However, little is known about other distinct functions of these cytokines and their interaction with non-hematopoietic cells. Three lines of evidence indicate that human EC also express the genes for chemokine receptors and thus play an active and important role as target cells for chemokine function. First, the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of vascular EC, during angiogenesis, is modulated by chemokines, apparently via specific receptors. Thus, IL-8 is an inducer of angiogenesis (17Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1798-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar), whereas PF-4 (18Maione T.E. Gray G.S. Petro J. Hunt A.J. Donner A.L. Bauer S.I. Carson H.F. Sharpe R.J.

Second, it has been suggested that leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and transmigration require that chemotactic factors be immobilized on the EC surface (23Rot A. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 291-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 24Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Shaw S. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 111-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This idea is necessitated due to the obvious conceptual difficulty in generating a chemotactic gradient of soluble chemokines under conditions of blood flow. Although chemokines can bind cell surface proteoglycans (24Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Shaw S. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 111-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 25Luster A.D.

Indeed, evidence for this hypothesis was provided in a recent study (33Endres M.J. Clapham P.R. Marsh M. Ahuja M. Turner J.D. McKnight A. Thomas J.F. Stobenau-Haggarty B. Choe S. Vance P.J. Wells T.N.C. Power C.A. Sutterwala S.S. Doms R.W. Landau N.R. Hoxie J.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), which showed that CXCR4 could function as an alternative receptor for isolates of HIV-2 in the absence of CD4. Therefore, to gain a better understanding of the role of chemokines, we examined the repertoire of chemokine receptor mRNAs expressed by EC. Furthermore, the functional expression and transcriptional regulation of CXCR4 receptor in EC was studied in detail, and its biological implications are discussed. Recombinant human IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, basic fibroblast growth factor, and transforming growth factor-β were purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Bacterial LPS, actinomycin D, and Me2SO were from Sigma. SDF-1α was obtained from Gryphon Sciences (South San Francisco, CA), and other chemokines were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Primary cultures of HUVEC, human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) were purchased from Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA) and maintained in their proprietary CS-C complete medium without antibiotics, in tissue culture flasks coated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma). Fetal bovine heart endothelial cells (FBHEC) were obtained from ATCC (CRL1395) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor. Cells were passaged at confluence and used within the first seven passages. Based on the published sequence of human chemokine receptors, the following pair of consensus degenerate 20-mer primers were synthesized from the ends of the third and seventh transmembrane domains of chemokine receptors.CK­F:5′­TAYCTSGCYATYGTSCAYGC­3′CK­R:5′­AARGCRTARATSAYKGGRTT­3′ The symbols follow the IUB/GCG convention (Y = C/T, S = C/G, R = A/G, and K = G/T). Total cellular RNA was isolated from 107 early passage HUVEC and HCAEC by the single extraction Tri-reagent procedure (Molecular Research Center, Inc. Cincinnati, OH), according to the manufacturer's protocol and stored dissolved in Formazol at −80 °C. PCR amplification of total RNA was done with the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) as described previously (34Gupta S.K. Singh J.P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 124: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Two μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with the “downstream” antisense oligomer, CK-R. The “upstream” oligomer CK-F, was added directly to the reaction tubes along with the PCR “reaction mix” and subjected to 35 cycles of amplification. The PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels and subcloned directly into the PCRII TA vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA from individual colonies were analyzed by restriction digestion and sequencing. Total RNA (10 μg/lane) was fractionated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.), and covalently linked with a UV cross-linker (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). For Northern analysis, 515-base pair cDNA probes of CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CCR1, CCR2, and CCR3 were used. The GAPDH gene probe (CLONTECH) was used to normalize RNA sample differences in each lane. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random-prime labeling kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and hybridized overnight at 42 °C in 6 × SSC buffer (1 × SSC = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Membranes were washed with a final stringency of 0.2 × SSC at 60 °C, and analyzed with a phosphorimager (Molecular Devices, Inc.) after exposure at room temperature for 3–5 days. Densitometry was used for quantitative analysis. Cell surface expression of CXCR4 receptor was analyzed as described previously (33Endres M.J. Clapham P.R. Marsh M. Ahuja M. Turner J.D. McKnight A. Thomas J.F. Stobenau-Haggarty B. Choe S. Vance P.J. Wells T.N.C. Power C.A. Sutterwala S.S. Doms R.W. Landau N.R. Hoxie J.A.

Briefly, 5 × 105 HUVEC were permeabilized in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 2 min, and then resuspended in ice-cold PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with the primary 12G5 antibody (35LaBranche C.C. Sauter M.M. Haggarty B.S. Vance P.J. Romano J. Hart T.K. Bugelski P.J. Hoxie J.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5509-5522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a control anti-PECAM antibody (R&D Systems) of the same subclass. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and labeled with a second-stage fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Tago Laboratories). FACS analysis was done with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For measurements of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i, EC were loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), rinsed with 1 mm EDTA in Dulbecco's PBS, and resuspended into Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% gelatin. Cells (1 × 106/ml) were stored on ice and diluted for use 1:1 with fresh Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer at 37 °C. Fluorescence of fura-2 in cells was measured with a dual channel fluorometer as described previously (36Lysko P.G. Webb C.L. Yue T.-L. Gu J.-L. Feuerstein G. Stroke. 1994; 25: 2476-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Chemokines were added from concentrated stocks in water. To establish the integrity of EC, we also measured [Ca2+]i stimulated by thrombin. HUVEC migration assay was performed using 5 × 105 cells/well (in CS-C medium) in the top chamber of a 6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore polycarbonate Transwell culture insert (Costar, Cambridge, MA) as reported previously (37Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casanovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Incubation was carried out at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 20 h. After incubation, migrated cells in the lower chamber were counted with a ZM Coulter counter (Coulter Diagnostics, Hialeah, FL). Percent migration was calculated based on the total initial input cells per well. To explore the expression of chemokine receptor transcripts in human EC, total cellular RNA from HUVEC was amplified by RT-PCR with the consensus region primers (see “Experimental Procedures”). An expected 515-base pair cDNA band was amplified and subcloned to generate a cDNA plasmid library enriched for chemokine receptor clones. A total of 110 out of the 250 isolated clones were randomly sequenced and analyzed for their sequence distribution. CXCR4, representing 45% of the sequenced clones was the most prevalent chemokine receptor, followed by clones with identity to CCR3 (10%), the eotaxin receptor. Also present were clones having inserts with CXCR1, CCR1, and CCR2 sequences. These data provide evidence that vascular EC have the ability to express mRNA for several chemokine receptors. The results are also consistent with previous reports where CXCR2 expression was detected in HUVEC by RT-PCR (38Schonbeck U. Brandt E. Petersen F. Flad H.-D. Loppnow H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2375-2383PubMed Google Scholar), and specific binding of IL-8 and RANTES was observed on the endothelium of postcapillary venules and veins in human skin by using an in situ binding assay (39Rot A. Hub E. Middleton J. Pons F. Rabeck C. Thierer K. Wintle J. Wolff B. Zsak M. Dukor P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Steady state expression of chemokine receptors in vascular EC was studied by Northern blot analysis of total RNA. Fig.1 A (arrow) shows that both HUVEC and HCAEC express similar amounts of an expected 1.8-kilobase size mRNA after hybridization with the CXCR4 cDNA probe. In fact, these results also suggest that CXCR4 is the most abundant chemokine receptor expressed in vascular EC, as identical Northern blots with EC RNA did not hybridize with 515-base pair CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CCR1, CCR2, and CCR3 cDNA probes (data not shown). It is conceivable that EC primarily express these chemokine receptors at a low level, and the binding of chemokines with cell surface proteoglycans facilitates their interaction with the specific receptors expressed in low copy numbers. In this context, it is important to note that several chemokines like IL-8, Gro-β, γIP-10, and PF-4 directly modulate EC proliferation or migration (17Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A.

Commun. 1995; 210: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), presumably in a receptor-mediated interaction. CXCR4 transcripts are well expressed in many non-hematopoietic vascular tissues like heart, brain, lung, and colon (40Federsppiel B. Melhado I.G. Duncan A.M.V. Delaney A. Schappert K. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F.R. Genomics. 1993; 16: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); however, at the cellular level, we found this expression was selective for EC, as indicated by the failure of total RNA from human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells to hybridize with the CXCR4 cDNA probe (Fig.1 B, lane 1). To obtain an initial insight into the regulation of CXCR4 in EC during inflammation, we treated the HUVEC with various mediators and measured its steady state mRNA levels after normalization against the GAPDH cDNA probe. Fig. 1(B and C) shows that IFN-γ and, to a lesser extent, TNF-α caused a decrease in CXCR4 mRNA levels after 24 h of treatment. IL-1β and LPS caused a significant induction, whereas no effect was observed after treatment with transforming growth factor-β, γIP-10, and Me2SO. The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D caused an almost complete abrogation of CXCR4 message in the same time period. The cell surface expression of CXCR4 was evaluated by FACS analysis of HUVEC by using the specific anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody 12G5 (35LaBranche C.C. Sauter M.M. Haggarty B.S. Vance P.J. Romano J. Hart T.K. Bugelski P.J. Hoxie J.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5509-5522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig.2, there was a shift in the fluorescence intensity of cells after treatment with 12G5, clearly indicating that mRNA expression of CXCR4 is translated into surface expression of the receptor on HUVEC. To help understand the kinetics of inflammation-mediated transcriptional regulation of CXCR4, we used actinomycin D to determine the half-life of its mRNA. As indicated by the selective degradation of existing mRNA upon addition of actinomycin D to EC cultures (Fig.3), CXCR4 mRNA has a short half-life of around 2 h and is probably subject to a rapid turnover. This is noteworthy, as such rapid turnover of CXCR4 may allow the EC to respond promptly during conditions of infection and inflammatory stress. In addition we also observed that actinomycin D had the unexpected effect of sharply increasing the steady state levels of CXCR4 mRNA after a short term exposure of only 15–30 min. Many cytokines and cytokine receptors, including CXCR4, have A-U-rich elements in their untranslated regions, which serve as targeting motifs for transcript degradation by specific RNases (41Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar). It is possible that, in addition to its action as a transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D also has the unique and immediate effect of imparting stability to existing transcripts of mRNA undergoing rapid turnover. Unlike other inducible chemokines, SDF-1α, which is the known ligand for CXCR4 (42Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T. Nature. 1996; 382: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 43Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Virelizier J.-L. Seisdedos F.A. Schwartz O. Heard J.-M. Lewis I.C. Legler D.F. Loetscher M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Nature. 1996; 382: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar), is constitutively expressed in numerous tissues (8Shirozu M. Nakano T. Inazawa J. Tashiro K. Tada H. Shinohara T. Honjo T. Genomics. 1995; 28: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar); therefore, its biological action is likely to be regulated at the level of CXCR4 receptor expression. We examined the kinetics of cytokine modulation of CXCR4 mRNA expression in EC, and Northern blots were done to study the effects of IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and LPS at different time intervals and concentration ranges. These mediators are known to be simultaneously up-regulated during inflammation and the pathogenesis of vascular diseases like atherosclerosis and restenosis (44Schwartz S.M. deBlois D. O'Brien E.R.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 445-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), and exhibited distinct effects on the expression of CXCR4 in EC in the initial studies (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 4, treatment of HUVEC with IFN-γ (103 units/ml) caused a rapid and sustained decrease in steady state levels of CXCR4 mRNA, which reached its maximum within 3 h after treatment and continued to exert its inhibitory effect up to 24 h thereafter. Furthermore, in HUVEC treated with IFN-γ (103 units/ml) for 24 h, there was a marked reduction in the half-life of CXCR4 mRNA from ∼2 h to about 15 min. Nuclear run-on experiments did not reveal any effect of IFN-γ on the rate of synthesis of CXCR4 mRNA in HUVEC (data not shown), thereby indicating that its inhibitory effect is caused at the level of CXCR4 mRNA stability. In contrast to IFN-γ, mediators like TNF-α, IL-1β, and LPS had a distinctly more complex and unique time-dependent biphasic effect on CXCR4 expression. This effect was characterized by an immediate decrease, followed by a subsequent reversal and increase in the steady state levels of CXCR4 mRNA despite continuous exposure of EC to the cytokines. The mechanism behind this biphasic mode of transcriptional regulation is unclear at present, although the most likely explanation is that the extended exposure of EC to TNF-α, IL-1β, and LPS imparts stability to newly synthesized CXCR4 transcripts that are otherwise subject to a rapid degradation. In comparison, LPS has been shown to cause a reduction in mRNA levels of CCR2, CCR1, and CCR5 (45Sica A. Saccani A. Borsatti A. Power C.A. Wells T.N. Luini W. Polentarutti N. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Our studies also show that, among the inflammatory mediators studied, IFN-γ is the dominant effector of CXCR4 transcription in EC. Even low concentrations of IFN-γ (10 units/ml, Fig.5), which had no effect on the expression of CCR2 (46Tangirala R.K. Murao K. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8050-8056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), were sufficient to achieve significant inhibition of CXCR4 mRNA. Moreover, when IFN-γ (100 units/ml) was added along with TNF-α, IL-1β, or LPS to EC cultures for 24 h, it continued to exert a down-regulatory effect on transcription (Fig. 5). In the same experiment, a combination of TNF-α (10 ng) with either IL-1β or LPS did not have a synergistic effect on CXCR4 expression. This is in marked contrast to their effect on CCR2 expression, which was completely abolished (46Tangirala R.K. Murao K. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8050-8056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and CXCR1 expression, which was significantly down-regulated by a combination of TNF-α and LPS (47Lloyd A.R. Biragyn A. Johnston J.A. Taub D.D. Xu L. Michiel D. Sprenger H. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28188-28192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, CXCR4 mRNA expression in EC is regulated in a unique pattern that has not been observed for other chemokine receptors such as CXCR1 and CCR2. To determine whether EC express a functional CXCR4 receptor, our subsequent studies used SDF-1α along with several other chemokines to assess their ability to induce changes in intracellular levels of Ca2+ and cause migration. As shown in Fig. 6, SDF-1α induced a rapid elevation of [Ca2+]i in various EC types, with maximal response at a concentration of 100 nm. In contrast, other chemokines like γ-IP10, IL-8, PF-4, MIP-1α, MCP-1, eotaxin, and RANTES had no effect on EC (data not shown). Since the Ca2+ flux induced by SDF-1α in primary cultures of HUVEC and HBMEC was small (50–70 nm) and characteristically variable, we used FBHEC, an established EC line, to calculate the EC50 of SDF-1α-mediated response. As evident in Fig. 6 (inset), SDF-1α induced a robust Ca2+ flux (up to 1 μm) with an EC50 of ∼2 nm in the case of FBHEC. We next studied the chemotactic response of EC to SDF-1α. SDF-1α induced a pronounced migration of ∼40% of input EC in a concentration-related manner with an EC50 of 10–20 nm (Fig. 7 A). It is intriguing to observe the high percentage of EC that migrated in response to SDF-1α, even though EC have limited migratory capability in comparison with neutrophils and monocytes. We also noticed that in contrast with other EC chemo-attractants like vitronectin (data not shown), the chemotactic response to SDF-1α was kinetically robust, and a majority of the migrated cells entered the lower chamber without adhering to the Transwell filter. In addition, checkerboard analysis also indicated that the migratory response of EC to SDF-1α was chemotactic rather than being chemokinetic (data not shown). It is important to note that, in our experiments, other chemokines like γ-IP10, IL-8, MIP-1α, MCP-1, eotaxin, and RANTES had no effect on EC chemotaxis. The lack of EC chemotaxis in response to IL-8 is noteworthy, especially in view of previous data (17Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1798-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar), and may be attributed to the heterogeneity that is known to exist among preparations of HUVEC cultures (48Watson C.A. Camera-Benson L. Palmer-Crocker R. Pober J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 447-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 49Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M. Science. 1995; 268: 448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations have obvious biological significance and may imply a role for SDF-1α in re-endothelialization after injury, an event that requires the directed migration of EC. Since CXCR4 expression is sharply down-regulated by IFN-γ, the ability of EC to migrate in response to SDF-1α was studied to examine the functional consequences of altered gene transcription. Treatment of EC for 24 h with IFN-γ (103 units/ml) produced a significant decrease (>60%) in the number of EC migrating in response to a SDF-1α gradient (Fig. 7 B). This correlates well with the transcriptional down-regulation of CXCR4 observed after treatment with IFN-γ. The data from the present study suggest that chemokines and their receptors, especially SDF-1α and CXCR4, may play an important role in the etiology of the EC response during vascular disease, inflammation, and infection. Constitutively expressed SDF-1α and CXCR4 may also be involved in the basal recruitment and diapedesis of monocytes and T-lymphocytes that is observed in the early fatty streaks in infant children (50Stary H.C. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 64: 91-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and in animal models of atherogenesis (51Gerrity R. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 103: 181-190PubMed Google Scholar). It is unlikely that inducible chemokines like MCP-1, which are usually not expressed in normal arteries (52Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. Gordon D. Wilcox J.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are responsible for the initial recruitment of these cells. Apart from this, CXCR4 is a co-receptor for the infection of T-lymphotropic strains of HIV-1 in CD4-positive susceptible cells (26Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3636) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that many cell lines that do not express CD4, including EC, are also susceptible to infection with various strains of HIV (32Corbeil J. Evans L.A. McQueen P.W. Vasak E. Edward P.D. Richman D.D. Penny R. Cooper D.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 140-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Moses A.V. Bloom F.E. Pauza C.D. Nelson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10474-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) by a CD4-independent mechanism. Although the chemokine receptor preferences of these HIV-1 strains have not been studied yet, it may involve the use of CXCR4 as their primary receptor. Indeed, some isolates of HIV-2 have been shown to use CXCR4 as an alternative receptor to infect CD4-negative B and T lymphocyte lines like Daudi, Nalm6, and BC7 (33Endres M.J. Clapham P.R. Marsh M. Ahuja M. Turner J.D. McKnight A. Thomas J.F. Stobenau-Haggarty B. Choe S. Vance P.J. Wells T.N.C. Power C.A. Sutterwala S.S. Doms R.W. Landau N.R. Hoxie J.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). It is thus no coincidence that IFN-γ, which down-regulates CXCR4 expression in EC, should be clinically tested as a prophylactic in advanced HIV infections and disease progression (54Murray H.W. Intensive Care Med. 1996; 22: S456-S461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a situation that coincides with the appearance of CXCR4-dependent lymphotropic strains of HIV in infected individuals. Further studies, aided by the development of anti-CXCR4 antibodies and antagonists will be needed to more clearly understand the pathophysiological role of CXCR4. We thank Dr. J. Hoxie at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) for the gift of anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody 12G5."

Three lines of evidence support this model. First, LDL cholesterol transport to ACAT can be blocked without inhibiting the movement of cholesterol from lysosomes to plasma membrane or from plasma membrane to endoplasmic reticulum.

Upon endocytosis, LDL is transported to lysosomes, where the protein is degraded and the cholesteryl ester core is hydrolyzed. Free cholesterol leaves the lysosomes and is transported to the plasma membrane, where most cellular cholesterol resides (2Lange Y. Ramos B.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15130-15134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Warnock D.E. Roberts C. Lutz M.S. Blackburn W.A. Young W.W. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10145-10153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol also moves into the cell interior, where it can be converted to cholesteryl ester by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzyme acyl-CoA/cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) or incorporated into lipoproteins, bile acids, or steroid hormones, depending on the cell type.The mechanism of cholesterol efflux from lysosomes and movement to other cellular sites is not well defined. Cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane is energy-independent and does not require an intact cytoskeleton (4Liscum L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), yet it is unknown whether transport is vesicle-mediated or via soluble carrier proteins. Furthermore, the route of cholesterol trafficking is an area of intense investigation. Several lines of evidence suggest that LDL cholesterol is rapidly transported to the plasma membrane (5Johnson W.J. Chacko G.K. Philips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5546-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Brasaemle D.L. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 103-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, two recent studies have provided evidence for a plasma membrane-independent pathway from lysosomes to ER (7Underwood K.W. Andemariam B. McWilliams G.L. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1556-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1556-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) investigated cholesterol transport using hydrophobic amines, drugs that inhibit specific cholesterol transport pathways. We found that LDL stimulation of cellular cholesterol esterification by ACAT is much more sensitive to hydrophobic amine inhibition than bulk cholesterol movement from lysosomes to plasma membrane and from plasma membrane to ER. We concluded that hydrophobic amines must inhibit either a previously uncharacterized transport pathway from lysosomes to plasma membrane or a signaling event that activates ACAT. Neufeld et al. (8Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) also presented strong evidence for an alternative pathway for LDL cholesterol movement to ER. Their data suggested that up to 30% of LDL cholesterol may traffic by this pathway.In this study, we provide further evidence supporting our model that, while the bulk of LDL cholesterol is mobilized to the plasma membrane, a portion is delivered to the ER by a plasma membrane-independent pathway. Hydrophobic amine inhibition of LDL cholesterol transport to ACAT was quantified in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and evidence is presented for a pathway that is uniquely sensitive to hydrophobic amine inhibition. Amphotericin B was used to confirm that LDL cholesterol is prevented from reaching the plasma membrane in the presence of hydrophobic amines. In addition, LDL cholesterol transport to ACAT was assessed in a CHO mutant with defective plasma membrane-to-ER cholesterol transport (9Jacobs N.L. Andemariam B. Underwood K.W. Panchalingam K. Sternberg D. Kielian M. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1973-1987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and found to be normal. The route and mechanism of LDL cholesterol movement was tested using pharmacological agents. We found that LDL cholesterol transport to ACAT proceeded while the Golgi complex was severely disrupted but that it was inhibited by agents that interfere with vesicular trafficking. Overall, our evidence strongly supports a vesicular LDL cholesterol transport pathway from lysosomes to ER that is independent of the plasma membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[1-14C]Oleic acid (50 mCi/mmol), [1,2,6,7-3H]cholesterol (46.5 Ci/mmol), [1,2,6,7-3H]cholesteryl linoleate (86 Ci/mmol), and cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate (59.5 mCi/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. 3-β[2-(Diethylamino)-ethoxy]-androst-5-en-17-one (U18666A) was purchased from Biomol.

On day 2, cells were washed with HBSS and refed 0.5 ml of H-5% LPDS. Additions of 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol in ethanol were made at staggered times. U18666A and imipramine were added 11.5 h before harvest. On day 4, cells were washed with TBS. Lipids were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2), and a chromatography standard was added (50 μg of cholesterol, 30 μg of cholesteryl oleate, and 0.001 μCi of [14C]cholesterol). [3H]Cholesterol and [3H]cholesteryl oleate were separated by thin layer chromatography using toluene/ethyl acetate (2:1) and visualized with iodine. [3H]Cholesteryl oleate formation is expressed as a percentage of total cellular [3H]cholesterol and represents the average of triplicate values.FITC-Dextran Uptake and Fluorescence MicroscopyOn day 0, CHO cells were seeded into two-well chamber slides (Falcon 4102, 20,000 cells/well) in H-5% NCS.

Roberts C. Lutz M.S. Blackburn W.A. Young W.W. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10145-10153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lange Y. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 329-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol in the plasma membrane is not static, however; it constantly moves between the cell interior and surface (33Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membrane cholesterol levels rise when LDL is internalized, as the LDL cholesterol is rapidly transported to the plasma membrane (6Brasaemle D.L. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 103-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Philips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). As the cholesterol pool expands, ACAT is activated in the ER, and excess cellular cholesterol is stored as cholesteryl esters (35Xu X.-X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17040-17048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).How does the signal reach ACAT that LDL cholesterol is expanding the cellular cholesterol content? One possibility is that LDL cholesterol is efficiently transported to the plasma membrane. The rising plasma membrane cholesterol level increases cholesterol cycling into the cell interior, which activates ACAT. Another possibility is that LDL cholesterol is transported along multiple pathways.Our hypothesis is that, while the bulk of LDL cholesterol is mobilized to the plasma membrane, a portion is delivered to the ER by a plasma membrane-independent route. Three lines of evidence from our studies support this model.(i) Conditions of hydrophobic amine inhibition of cholesterol transport were defined in which LDL cholesterol freely moves from lysosomes to plasma membrane and plasma membrane cholesterol can freely move to ACAT in the ER. Yet under these conditions, LDL cholesterol does not activate ACAT and does not get esterified. Furthermore, LDL cholesterol is not esterified even if ACAT is independently activated by 25-HC. These results suggest that a cholesterol transport pathway exists that is exquisitely sensitive to hydrophobic amine inhibition.(ii) Cholesterol transport mutant 3-6 exhibits normal movement of LDL cholesterol from lysosomes to plasma membrane but completely defective transport of plasma membrane cholesterol to ACAT (9Jacobs N.L. Andemariam B. Underwood K.W. Panchalingam K. Sternberg D. Kielian M. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1973-1987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dahl N.K. Daunais M.A. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1839-1849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we found that LDL cholesterol transport from lysosomes to ACAT is normal in mutant 3-6, which suggests that the fraction of LDL cholesterol that is esterified does not traffic through the plasma membrane on its way to the ER. The portion transported to ACAT in mutant 3-6 is probably responsible for the detectable LDL stimulation of [3H]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl [3H]esters (28Dahl N.K. Daunais M.A. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1839-1849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).(iii) The kinetics of LDL cholesterol versus cellular cholesterol incorporation into cholesteryl esters was measured. If our hypothesis is correct, LDL [3H]cholesterol arrival at ACAT should activate [14C]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl esters. Thus, the [3H/14C] ratio should be high at early times and then decline. If LDL cholesterol was transported to the plasma membrane before moving to the ER, then we expected a low 3H/14C ratio that increased with time. However, our results indicated that LDL cholesterol was not diluted by the plasma membrane cholesterol pool before reaching ACAT.The existence of a lysosome-to-ER pathway of cholesterol transport was first proposed by Tabas (36Tabas I. Rosoff W.J. Boykow G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1266-1272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for such a pathway was previously presented by Underwood et al. (7Underwood K.W. Andemariam B. McWilliams G.L. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1556-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Neufeldet al. (8Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Neufeld et al. used 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) to evaluate cholesterol transport pathways in cultured cells. CD is a cyclic oligomer of glucose that serves as a rapid, efficient extracellular acceptor of plasma membrane cholesterol (37Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Cells were preloaded with LDL in the presence of progesterone and then incubated with CD in the absence of LDL and progesterone. [3H]Oleate incorporation into cholesteryl [3H]oleate was used as a measure of the arrival of LDL cholesterol in the ER. They found that CD blunted approximately 70% of the LDL stimulation of ACAT, which suggested that about 70% of the LDL cholesterol was transported to ACAT via the plasma membrane and that the residual LDL cholesterol was transported by a plasma membrane-independent pathway.Evidence seemingly against a lysosome-to-ER pathway was presented by Lange et al. (17Lange Y. Ye J. Chin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17018-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In one experiment, hepatoma cells were incubated with [3H]CL-LDL, and the time course of re-esterification of LDL [3H]cholesterol was monitored along with its movement to a cholesterol oxidase-accessible pool. After 2 h, 78% of LDL [3H]cholesterol was found in a cholesterol oxidase-accessible pool, while the residual cholesterol was esterified by ACAT (8%) or in a cholesterol oxidase-inaccessible pathway (14%). These results are consistent with our model.In a second experiment, the kinetics of LDL cholesterol and cellular cholesterol esterification were measured. Lange et al. (17Lange Y. Ye J. Chin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17018-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) loaded endocytic compartments with [3H]CL-LDL at 18 °C while labeling the plasma membrane with [14C]cholesterol. Upon warming the cells, they observed that plasma membrane [14C]cholesterol incorporation into cholesteryl esters was linear with time. This is not surprising, given that FU5AH hepatoma cells have high constitutive cholesterol esterification activity (17Lange Y. Ye J. Chin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17018-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is also not surprising that LDL [3H]cholesterol incorporation into cholesteryl esters showed a lag, since this reflects the need to hydrolyze [3H]cholesterol linoleate. Our experiments were performed with CHO cells cultured in lipoprotein-deficient serum, in which ACAT activity is at a low, basal level. Our data show that LDL [3H]cholesterol activates ACAT, which then stimulates esterification of cellular cholesterol.In a third experiment, Lange et al. (17Lange Y. Ye J. Chin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17018-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) found no effect of hydrophobic amines on LDL [3H]cholesterol accessibility to cholesterol oxidase. They attribute hydrophobic amine inhibition of LDL cholesterol esterification to a block in the plasma membrane-to-ER pathway. We and others (26Harmala A.-S. Porn M.I. Mattjus P. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have found no significant effect of imipramine on the plasma membrane-to-ER pathway. Furthermore, we have used multiple experimental approaches to show that hydrophobic amines affect LDL cholesterol transport from lysosomes to the plasma membrane. In the presence of hydrophobic amines, LDL cholesterol is not accessible to cholesterol oxidase or amphotericin B. It is also not available for desorption to extracellular acceptors (38Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By filipin staining and subcellular fractionation, it is sequestered within lysosomes (38Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Rousson R. Bonnet J. Pentchev P.G. Louisot P. Vanier M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We attribute the results of Lange et al.(17Lange Y. Ye J. Chin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17018-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) results to cholesterol oxidase reaching an intracellular pool of cholesterol.Our current study does not resolve whether the Golgi apparatus is involved in cholesterol movement. We added brefeldin A to the cultures 1 h prior to the addition of [3H]CL-LDL. By the time LDL [3H]cholesterol was leaving the lysosomes, the Golgi complex was disrupted (30Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Yet esterification of LDL [3H]cholesterol proceeded normally for several hours. Therefore, an intact Golgi complex is not necessary for cholesterol transport from lysosomes to ER. However, we cannot conclude that the pathway is Golgi-independent. The lack of an observed brefeldin A effect on LDL cholesterol esterification could be due to a transport “vehicle,” which normally docks at the Golgi, being capable of finding its docking site at the merged Golgi/ER. This is consistent with the results of Neufeld et al. (8Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), who found little brefeldin A effect on LDL stimulation of [3H]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl [3H]oleate. However, this experiment was complicated by the effect of Golgi cholesterol arriving in the ER and stimulating ACAT. The most compelling evidence for Golgi involvement in cholesterol transport comes from filipin electron microscopy, showing cholesterol enrichment of Golgi cisternae following LDL uptake (40Coxey R.A.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).LDL cholesterol movement from lysosomes to ER is likely to be a vesicle-mediated event. First, transport was inhibited by monensin and nigericin, ionophores that neutralize acidic compartments such as endosomes and the trans-Golgi network.

https://openalex.org/W2083309890,"Trio contains two functional guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) domains for the Rho-like GTPases and a serine/threonine kinase domain. In vitro, GEF domain 1(GEFD1) is specifically active on Rac1, while GEF domain 2 (GEFD2) targets RhoA. To determine whether Trio could activate Rac1 and RhoA in vivo, we measured the effect of Trio on Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways and cytoskeletal rearrangments events mediated by the two GTPases. We show that: (i) the GEFD1 domain of Trio triggers the MAPK pathway leading to Jun kinase (JNK) activation and the production of membrane ruffles; (ii) co-expression of the TrioGEFD1 domain with a dominant-negative form of Rac blocked JNK induction, whereas a dominant-negative form of Cdc42 did not; (iii) a deletion mutant of TrioGEFD1 lacking a region important for exchange activity could not stimulate JNK activity; (iv) in contrast, the TrioGEFD2 domain does not stimulate JNK activity and induces the formation of stress fibers, as does activated RhoA; (v) furthermore, co-expression of both GEF domains induces simultaneously the formation of ruffles and stress fibers. Trio, therefore represents a unique member of the Rho-GEFs family possessing two functional domains of distinct specificities, that allow it to link Rho and Rac signaling pathway in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2090966154,"Within the central nervous system, apolipoprotein E (apoE) synthesis is increased in response to nerve injury, a finding that may reflect a role for apoE in neuronal remodeling. Recent studies show that apoE3 promotes and apoE4 inhibits neurite outgrowth in cultured neuronal cells. Interestingly, these isoform-specific effects are observed only when apoE is presented to cells in the presence of an exogenous lipid source such as rabbit β-very low density lipoprotein (β-VLDL), making it difficult to discern the biologically active form of apoE or to understand the role of the lipid source. In the present study we tested whether a cell-derived lipidated form of apoE can alter neurite outgrowth in the absence of β-VLDL by constructing Neuro-2a cell lines expressing high levels of apoE. Our results showed that endogenous apoE3 stimulated neurite outgrowth, whereas the endogenous apoE4 isoform was neutral. Furthermore, β-VLDL antagonized the stimulatory effects of the endogenous apoE3. Characterization of the secreted apoE3 indicated that the neurite outgrowth-stimulating activity could be recovered from culture medium with an anti-apoE immunoaffinity column and was present in a poorly lipidated particle with a density between 1.19 and 1.26 g/ml. These results indicated that the biological activity of apoE3 in stimulating neurite outgrowth was inherent in the cell-derived apoE particle and was not dependent on either (a) an interaction of apoE3 with an artificial lipid source or (b) independent actions of apoE3 and β-VLDL.

Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) first identified in 1973 as a constituent of human very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and subsequently found in all lipoprotein classes. ApoE plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis by mediating the hepatic clearance of plasma cholesteryl ester-rich VLDL and chylomicron remnants. In contrast to other apolipoproteins, which are synthesized only in liver and gut, apoE is expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types including abundant expression by steroidogenic cells and astrocytes of the brain (1Weisgraber K.H.

ApoE is present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 5–10 μg/ml, which is approximately 5–10% of its plasma concentration (5Roheim P.S. Carey M. Forte T. Vega G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The endogenous lipoproteins in CSF are predominantly HDL-like particles that arise from astrocyte-derived apoE in addition to apoAI, which presumably crosses the blood-brain barrier (7Pitas R.E.

The three common isoforms of human apoE result from cysteine-arginine interchanges at residues 112 and 158 (14Nathan B.P. Chang K.-C. Bellosta S. Brisch E. Ge N. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol.

A correlation between the apoE ε4 allele and late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease has been identified (15Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D. Pericak-Vance M. Enghild J. Salvessen G.S.

However, the role of apoE in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is still unknown. There is evidence that apoE interacts with protein components of both pathologic features of Alzheimer's disease (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) in an isoform- specific manner (18Schmechel D.E. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Crain B.J. Hulette C.M. Joo S.H. Pericak-Vance M.A. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, purified delipidated apoE will stimulate isoform-specific differences in neurite outgrowth when added to neuronal cells in culture (14Nathan B.P. Chang K.-C. Bellosta S. Brisch E. Ge N.

A. 1995; 92: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A murine neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro-2a, exposed to delipidated apoE3 has significantly longer neurite extensions when compared with either control cells or cells treated with apoE4 (14Nathan B.P. Chang K.-C. Bellosta S. Brisch E. Ge N. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19791-19799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The delipidated apoE4 isoform has an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth that correlates with destabilization of microtubular arrays (14Nathan B.P. Chang K.-C. Bellosta S. Brisch E. Ge N. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19791-19799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these isoform-specific differences are only observed when an exogenous lipid source (rabbit β-VLDL) is added along with the delipidated apoE isoforms. Neither the rabbit β-VLDL, which contains abundant rabbit apoE, nor the human apoE alone alters neurite outgrowth. Neuro-2a cell lines expressing low quantities of apoE isoforms display similar isoform-specific differences in the presence of rabbit β-VLDL, yet are indistinguishable from control cells that lack apoE expression in the absence of the exogenous lipid source (22Bellosta S.

Multiple lipid sources (VLDL, triglyceride-rich emulsions, HDL, and HDL-like CSF lipoproteins) can substitute for β-VLDL to propagate similar isoform-specific differences (21Holtzman D.M. Pitas R.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30121-30125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, a puzzling aspect of these studies is that CSF lipoproteins fail to induce a difference in neuritogenesis unless they are enriched with exogenous human apoE (23Fagan A.M. Bu G. Sun Y. Daugherty A. Holtzman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30121-30125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), even though the CSF HDL-like particles already contain apoE (7Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Hui D. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14352-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fagan A.M. Bu G. Sun Y. Daugherty A. Holtzman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30121-30125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Importantly, these studies do not identify a physiologically significant or biologically active form of apoE because they require artificial lipid sources to observe apoE-induced stimulated neurite outgrowth. If apoE-mediated alterations in neurite outgrowth are relevant to neuronal remodeling events in vivo, it is likely that the biologically active form of apoE is a cell-derived, lipidated complex that can act in the absence of β-VLDL or other artificial lipid sources. To test this possibility we constructed Neuro-2a cell lines that secrete higher levels of the apoE isoforms. These cells produced a minimally lipidated apoE3 that stimulated neurite outgrowth in the absence of exogenous lipid. Under identical conditions, apoE4 had no effect on neurite outgrowth, indicating that the E4 isoform was neutral and not inhibitory. Furthermore, exogenous β-VLDL antagonized the stimulatory effects of cell-derived apoE3. Thus, these studies identified a minimally lipidated form of apoE that was biologically active in promoting neurite outgrowth. A high expression apoE3 vector was constructed by inserting a PCR-generated apoE3 cDNA into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The apoE3 insert was produced with the following PCR conditions: 17 ng of template (pHE54, generous gift of John Taylor and David Walker, Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease), 5 units of Taq polymerase, 50 μm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.01% gelatin, 10% Me2SO, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 5 μm high annealing temperature primers (each incorporating a unique 5′ restriction enzyme site). The translational enhancer of the alpha mosaic virus from the expression plasmid pCMV4 (24Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted 4 bases upstream of the apoE3 cDNA to yield pC1E3. The apoE4 expression vector, pC1E4, was made by substituting theSacII-FseI fragment of pC1E3 with the corresponding fragment from the apoE4 sequence in plasmid pFE (25Reyland M.E. Gwynne J.T. Forgez P. Prack M.M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All PCR inserts and junctions were verified by standard sequencing techniques. Neuro-2a cells were maintained in a 37 °C humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals), 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B). Neuro-2a cells were plated at 1.0 × 106 cells in 10 ml of medium A per 10-cm dish and were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Stable integrants were selected and maintained in medium B (medium A plus 350 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.)). Total RNA was isolated from confluent 10-cm plates of parental, apoE3, and apoE4 cell lines using Stat-60 (Tel-Test) reagent and protocol. Total RNA (25 μg) was denatured, subjected to electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, and transferred to a nylon membrane by overnight capillary transfer. The membrane was probed with a 32P random-primed apoE fragment (nucleotides 209–653), and hybridization was visualized with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Cells were plated at 1.0 × 107 cells in 10 ml of medium A per 10-cm dish, incubated overnight at 37 °C, washed twice with medium A, and incubated for an additional 24 h in 10 ml of fresh medium A. Conditioned medium was removed; cells were washed 2 times with PBS and solubilized in 0.5 ml of 2% SDS in PBS for total protein determination. Conditioned medium was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl (TBS) containing 7% nonfat milk, and 0.05% Tween 20. The blocked membrane was incubated with affinity purified polyclonal goat anti-human apoE antibody (Biodesign International) at 2 μg/ml overnight at room temperature in TBS containing 1% nonfat milk and 0.2% Tween 20. The membrane was washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature in TBS containing 1% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Neuro-2a cells were plated onto 18-mm glass circle coverslips in 12-well tissue culture plates at 5.0 × 103 cells in 4 ml of medium A per well and allowed to adhere overnight at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in ice-cold PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS, permeabilized in ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and blocked in PBS containing 10% FBS and 0.5% Triton X-100 for an additional 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with an affinity purified polyclonal goat anti-human apoE antibody at 2 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% FBS and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (Jackson Immuno Research) at 1:2000 in in PBS containing 1% FBS and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 37 °C. Glass slips were washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, mounted in SlowFade (Molecular Probes), and analyzed with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 scanning confocal system mounted on a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. Images were saved as Bio-Rad Pic files and were subsequently converted into Tif files. ApoE concentration in conditioned medium was determined by ELISA as follows: 96-well plates were coated with 100 μl of affinity purified goat anti-human apoE antibody (5 μg/ml) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The plate was washed twice with PBS and blocked with 400 μl of PBS containing 7% non-fat milk for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed twice. The coated plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 100 μl of conditioned medium and washed twice, and 100 μl of a biotin-labeled affinity purified goat anti-human apoE polyclonal diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 0.5% non-fat milk was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing four times, 100 μl of streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase (Life Technologies, Inc.) diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 0.5% non-fat milk was added, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The plate was washed six times; 150 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate (Sigma) was added, and color development was monitored at 650 nm. A standard curve was generated with purified human apoE (Panvera) at concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 ng. Samples were assayed in triplicate. Parental, apoE3, and apoE4 Neuro-2a cell lines were trypsinized and plated at low cell densities on days −4 and −2. At time 0 cells were trypsinized for exactly 2 min and subsequently plated in medium A at a density of 2.0 × 104 cells per 60-mm dish. After 2 h at 37 °C, medium was removed, the dish washed twice with basal medium (medium A lacking FBS), and freshly made basal medium plus N2 growth supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.) either with or without rabbit β-VLDL (40 μg of cholesterol/ml) was added. Cells were incubated for 96 h at 37 °C with 1 medium change at 48 h. At 96 h, cells were fixed in PBS containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and nonspecifically stained with 0.002% acridine orange in PBS for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and coverslipped. Images were captured with a 20 × objective and filter group specific for rhodamine fluorescence on the same system stated above. Images were converted into TIF format and analyzed with the UTHSCSA Image Tool program (developed at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). 2Available from the internet by anonymous FTP from ftp: maxrad6.uthscsa.edu. Every cell that contained a process longer than the cell diameter was measured (longest neurite only). Initial samples contained microsphere calibration standards (Duke Scientific Corp.) of a mean diameter of 9.975 ± 0.061 μm. An affinity chromatography isolation procedure utilizing the human apoE-specific monoclonal antibody 1E was employed. Purified 1E antibody was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) by incubating 10 mg of antibody in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, 0.5 m NaCl with 2 ml of pre-swelled CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B on a rotary shaker overnight at 4 °C. The gel was washed with 10 ml of 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, 0.5m NaCl, and remaining active groups were blocked for 2 h with 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0. The gel was then washed with three cycles of alternating pH using 10 ml of 0.1 macetate, pH 4.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl. The coupled gel was packed into a glass column, and conditioned media from cells secreting apoE3 were recycled at ∼1 ml/min overnight at 4 °C. The column was washed with 100 ml of PBS, and apoE3-containing particles were eluted in 60 ml of 100 mm triethylamine, pH 11.5, and immediately neutralized with 20 ml of 1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8. The apoE3 particles were dialyzed and concentrated into PBS and subsequently into basal medium using Centriprep 50 concentrators (Amicon). The final apoE3 preparation was sterilized by filtration through a pre-blocked (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) 0.2-μm filter (Schleicher & Schuell). Each apoE3 preparation was analyzed by Western blotting and quantified by ELISA as described above. Parental Neuro-2a cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 103 cells per well of a 24-well tissue culture plate (Costar) in medium A. After 2 h at 37 °C, medium was removed; the dish was washed twice with basal medium (medium A lacking FBS), and incubation was continued for 48 h at 37 °C with either basal medium plus N2 supplement alone or with immunopurified apoE3 (30 μg/ml) in basal medium plus N2 supplements. The cells were fixed, stained, and analyzed as stated above. All microscopy experiments were coded before confocal image analysis and again before neurite measurements using double blind coding procedures. Preparation of the rabbit β-VLDL was as described (27Kowal R.C. Herz J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except all protease inhibitors were omitted. Rabbit β-VLDL was stored at 4 °C under nitrogen and was used within 2 weeks of isolation. HDL3 (1.125 g/ml < ρ < 1.225 g/ml) was isolated by standard ultracentrifugation techniques (28Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). The lipidation state of apoE secreted by Neuro-2a cells was determined by ultracentrifugation using KBr for density adjustment. Conditioned medium (4 ml) was adjusted to ρ = 1.20 g/ml, underlaid with 4 ml at ρ = 1.34 g/ml, and overlaid with 4 ml at ρ = 1 .10 g/ml. Gradients were centrifuged at 38,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor for 48 h at 18 °C. Fractions were collected from the top of the tube, density measured by weight, and apoE content determined by ELISA. Secreted apoE was delipidated with diethyl ether/ethanol as described (29Shore V. Shore B. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1962-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. High capacity expression vectors for stable expression of human apoE were constructed by incorporating the alpha mosaic virus translational enhancer into the apoE 5′-untranslated region within the pcDNA3 vector in which expression was driven by the strong cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer (Invitrogen). Multiple cell lines for each apoE isoform were isolated and characterized for apoE production. The Northern blot in Fig. 1 shows similar levels of apoE3 and apoE4 mRNAs in representative cell lines expressing the transfected apoE cDNA, whereas apoE mRNA was not detected in the parental cell line. Conditioned media from each of these cell lines were analyzed by Western blotting using an affinity purified apoE polyclonal antibody as shown in Fig.2. The parent Neuro-2a cell line was completely devoid of apoE immunoreactivity, whereas the apoE3 and apoE4 cell lines each showed the expected 36-kDa apoE band. Quantification of apoE accumulation in conditioned medium showed high levels of expression for both apoE3 and apoE4 cell lines (TableI). These values were approximately 100-fold greater than previously reported for apoE-expressing Neuro-2a cell lines (22Bellosta S. Nathan B.P. Orth M. Dong L.-M. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol.

Conditioned media (100 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with an affinity purified polyclonal goat anti-human apoE antibody. After incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG, bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. The slight difference in mobility of the apoE3 and apoE4 bands is due to curvature in the running front and was not seen in other experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IApolipoprotein E secretionCell lineApolipoprotein E genotypeApoENeurite extensionFirst 48 hSecond 48 hμg/mg cell proteinParent Neuro-2a−NDND100% ± 8.001-aAverage of three experiments.Clone 1BE38.3 ± 1.3912.3 ± 2.34214% ± 22.901-aAverage of three experiments.,1-bp value = 0.0001 compared with parent Neuro-2a cell line.Clone 1CE35.3 ± 0.5210.9 ± 0.54155% ± 11.541-bp value = 0.0001 compared with parent Neuro-2a cell line.,1-cAverage from one experiment.Clone 1E4AE44.3 ± 0.195.7 ± 0.59114% ± 10.801-aAverage of three experiments.Clone 1E4CE45.3 ± 0.108.6 ± 0.0197% ± 5.62C1-a Average of three experiments.1-b p value = 0.0001 compared with parent Neuro-2a cell line.1-c Average from one experiment. Open table in a new tab Immunocytochemical localization of the Neuro-2a-associated apoE showed a punctate staining pattern throughout the entire cell with the exception of the nucleus that was devoid of staining (Fig.3, C and D). ApoE staining was particularly concentrated within the growth cones of the extending neurites in both apoE3- and apoE4-expressing cells. Each of the above analyses indicated no detectable apoE expression by the parental cell line and, importantly, similar levels of apoE expression by apoE3 and apoE4 cell lines. The above cell lines were analyzed in a neurite extension assay. Fig.4 A shows representative confocal images from the three cell lines at the conclusion of the 96-h assay in the absence of β-VLDL. Strikingly, the cells secreting apoE3 had substantially longer neurite extensions than either the apoE4 or control cells. To quantify these differences, multiple images were saved from three independent experiments and analyzed for neurite length. Fig. 5 A demonstrates that the apoE3-secreting cell line had significantly longer neurites (214%, p = 0.0001 versus control) than either control (set to 100%) or apoE4-secreting cells (114%) in the absence of β-VLDL. The data were further analyzed to ascertain whether the observed mean differences were indicative of uniform behavior within the cell population or due to a minor subpopulation of cells with dramatically longer neurites. Fig. 5 B illustrates that the distribution of neurite lengths was shifted throughout the cell population in the apoE3-secreting cells, whereas the apoE4-secreting cells were nearly indistinguishable from the control cells.Figure 5Quantification of cell-derived apoE isoform effects on neurite outgrowth in the absence and presence of β-VLDL. Cells were grown for 96 h in N2-supplemented basal medium alone or in the presence of β-VLDL (40 μg of cholesterol/ml). Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and nonspecifically stained with acridine orange. Multiple confocal images for each treatment in all three cell lines were captured using a 20 × objective and analyzed in the Image Tool program. Neurite extensions were determined by measuring the longest neurite outgrowth from 60 to 90 responsive cells (cells containing a neurite that is at least 1 cell diameter in length). A shows the average neurite extensions from three independent experiments both in the absence and presence of β-VLDL (error bars indicate standard error). The level of significance of the differences was calculated for the apoE3-secreting cells compared with control Neuro-2a cells in the absence of β-VLDL (*, p = 0.0001) and for the apoE3-secreting cells in the absence of β-VLDL compared with apoE3-secreting cells in the presence of β-VLDL (**, p = 0.0005). These data were analyzed to determine the percentage of total cells (N) expressing neurites of defined lengths in the absence of β-VLDL (B) or in the presence of β-VLDL (C).Error bars in B and C indicate the standard deviation. Error bars not shown are within the area of the symbol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The apoE concentration in the medium after 48 and 96 h of the extension assay was measured in two clonal lines expressing each apoE isoform. Table I shows some variation in secreted apoE, yet the neurite extension results for these clones were consistent with isoform-specific modulation that was relatively unaffected by the small differences in secreted apoE. For example, the 1C and 1E4C clones showed identical apoE concentrations at 48 h, and the 1E4C apoE concentration differed from the 1C concentration only by 20% at 96 h. Nevert"
https://openalex.org/W2324864477,"We have analysed the role of the morphogenetic factors hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF), neuregulin and E-cadherin in the process of metastasis and morphogenesis of mammary carcinoma cells. The cDNAs for HGF, neuregulin and E-cadherin were stably expressed in anaplastic human MDA MB 435 carcinoma cells. The altered cells were then injected into the mammary fat pads of nude mice, where they form tumors which can spontaneously metastasize to the lungs. We found that expression of HGF or neuregulin promoted metastasis whereas expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin was inhibitory. Moreover, expression of E-cadherin reconstituted the ability of the cells to form morphogenetic structures in matrigel cultures in response to HGF. These data demonstrate that HGF and neuregulin, which control branching or lobulo-alveolar morphogenesis of normal breast epithelium, do have metastasis-promoting effects on breast carcinoma cells. Moreover, our results suggest that the differential activities of the two factors can be explained by the degree of epithelial differentiation: induction of morphogenesis requires an intact epithelial adhesion and differentiation system, whereas induction of metastasis is observed when the cells have lost their epithelial characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2057522260,"LAP2 is an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane which binds lamins and chromosomes and is suggested to have an important role in nuclear envelope organization. In a previous study we identified an internal 76-amino acid region of LAP2 which is required for stable targeting of the protein to the nuclear envelope. Here, we have mapped the lamin binding region of LAP2 and demonstrate that it coincides with this nuclear envelope targeting domain. In contrast, we found that the portion of LAP2 involved in binding to chromosomes resides in a separate region of the protein near its NH2 terminus. The minimal lamin binding region of LAP2 is capable of conferring stable nuclear envelope localization when attached to the transmembrane and partial lumenal domains of a protein that shows no nuclear envelope targeting activity. This directly supports the notion that a major mechanism for localization of integral membrane proteins at the inner nuclear membrane involves binding to lamins, which would constrain diffusion through the continuous nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum membrane system.

It consists of a double membrane that is perforated by pore complexes and which is lined by the nuclear lamina in higher eukaryotic cells. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the more peripheral ER and is linked to the inner nuclear membrane via a “pore membrane” adjacent to the pore complexes. Whereas the outer membrane is biochemically and functionally similar to peripheral ER, the inner membrane differs markedly from the latter because of its association with the nuclear lamina and its content of specific integral membrane proteins that are mostly absent from the peripheral ER (5Marshall I.C.B.

The lamina contains a polymer of intermediate-type filament proteins termed lamins as well as a number of more minor lamina-associated polypeptides. Four major lamin subtypes have been identified in mammalian somatic cells, lamins A, B1, B2, and C (for review, see Ref. 3Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin.

Otefin appears to be more peripherally associated with the inner nuclear membrane based on chemical extraction and contains a short hydrophobic segment at its COOH terminus that is not predicted to span the inner nuclear membrane (15Ashery-Padan R.

A fifth NE-specific protein with a putative transmembrane domain, emerin, has been identified in mammals (16Manilal S. Nguyen T.M. Sewry C.A. Morris G.E. Hum. Mol.

All three well characterized integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane, LAP1 and LAP2 (9Foisner R. Gerace L.

Through this binding interaction, they could contribute to the attachment of the nuclear lamina to the inner nuclear membrane. Lamins (19Yuan J. Simos G. Blobel G. Georgatos S.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14653-14656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) bind to chromatin. At least some of these interactions are likely to promote the attachment of chromatin to the NE and higher order chromosome organization in the interphase nucleus. The ability of LAP2 to bind to lamins and chromosomes is regulated by mitotic phosphorylation (9Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the dynamics of this protein during mitosis are closely linked to the processes of NE disassembly and reformation. LBR also is phosphorylated during mitosis (25Nikolakaki E. Meier J. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6208-6213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Courvalin J.C. Segil N. Blobel G. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19035-19038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but whether this affects its ability to bind to chromatin and lamin is not known. The question of how integral proteins become targeted to the inner nuclear membrane has been raised by a number of recent studies. During mitosis when the NE is disassembled, LAP1 and LAP2 (27Yang L. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) as well as LBR (28Ellenberg J. Siggia E.D. Moreira J.E. Smith C.L. Presley J.F. Worman H.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) become dispersed throughout bulk ER membranes, and the NE appears to lose its identity as a distinct membrane system. Conversely these proteins become highly concentrated at the chromosome surfaces during late anaphase, when nuclear membrane reassembly around chromosomes takes place. It has been proposed that segregation of integral membrane proteins to the reforming NE at the end of mitosis is driven by binding interactions at the chromosome surfaces in combination with lateral diffusion through a continuous ER reticulum (6Gerace L. Foisner R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 127-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Ellenberg J. Siggia E.D. Moreira J.E. Smith C.L. Presley J.F. Worman H.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may operate during interphase to target newly synthesized integral membrane proteins to the inner nuclear membrane (6Gerace L. Foisner R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 127-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Wiese C. Wilson K.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Smith S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is conceivable that integral proteins are delivered to the inner nuclear membrane by some other process that does not involve simple diffusion in the membrane bilayer. We recently identified a 76-amino acid region in the nucleoplasmic domain of LAP2 which is required for Triton-stable targeting to the NE (10Furukawa K. Pante N. Aebi U. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated directly whether the NE targeting of LAP2 could be caused by binding interactions at the inner nuclear membrane. For this we mapped the lamin and chromatin binding regions of LAP2. We found that the region of LAP2 which is necessary and sufficient for stable NE targeting coincides with the lamin binding region but is distinct from the region involved in chromosome binding. We discuss the possibility that binding to lamins could be a major mechanism for targeting integral proteins to the inner nuclear membrane. For yeast two-hybrid studies (31Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar), members of a set of LAP2 fragments described in (10Furukawa K. Pante N. Aebi U. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) were inserted into theBamHI site of the GAL4-DNA binding domain vector pAS2. Full-length cDNAs for lamin B1 (NcoI-AccI fragment), lamin B2 (NcoI fragment), and vimentin (BstBI-EcoRI fragment) were subcloned into theBamHI site of the GAL4 activation domain vector pACT2 using Klenow fill-in and BglII linkers. To construct the ΔNC1-TM LAP2-lectin fusion, polymerase chain reaction primers (GCG CGA TCC TCA GCG CCC TTC AAA GTA and TGC AGA TCT GTG AGG CTC TAT AAA GGA GGC) were used to amplify the transmembrane and partial lumenal domains from a chicken hepatic lectin cDNA (32Drickamer K. Mamon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 15156-15161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5827-5839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After gel purification, this fragment was cleaved with BamHI and BglII and subcloned into the BglII site of the HA-LAP2ΔNC1 plasmid (10Furukawa K. Pante N. Aebi U. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). GST-LAP2 fusion constructs were generated in the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). GST-LAP2ΔC1 was constructed by subcloning the BamHI ΔC1 fragment as described in Ref. 10Furukawa K. Pante N. Aebi U. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar into theBamHI site of pGEX-2T; it encodes amino acids 1–398 of LAP2 fused to the COOH-terminal end of GST. All remaining deletion constructs in this series derive from this parental plasmid. Deletions ΔG8, ΔG6, ΔG5, ΔG4, and ΔG3 were constructed by digestion of GST-LAP2ΔC1 with StyI, HindIII, PpuMI-NotI, NotIHindIII, and NotI, respectively, followed by fill-in with Klenow and re-ligation. Deletion ΔG1 results from digestion of GST-LAP2ΔC1 with XhoI followed by re-ligation, whereas ΔG9 comes from FseI digestion, end-polishing with mung bean nuclease, and re-ligation. A description of the two-hybrid system that was used for this work has been published elsewhere (31Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Briefly, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y187 was transformed by the procedure of Ref. 34Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar and grown on complete minimal plates lacking Trp and Leu (−Trp −Leu medium). Induction of the lacZ reporter gene was monitored by plating on media containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside or direct assay of β-galactosidase activity with O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (35Reynolds A. Lundblad V. Dorris D. Keareney M. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Protocols opinions in Molecular Biology.

For platings, freshly grown transformants were streaked to −Trp −Leu plates containing 0.04 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside and 70 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and grown for 3–5 days at 30 °C. For the liquid method, overnight cultures grown in −Trp −Leu liquid were diluted, grown to A600 = 1.0, and subsequently permeabilized by SDS/chloroform and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. 5-μg epitope-tagged expression vectors were transfected into HeLa cells by SupraFect transfection (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The localization of chimeric LAP2 proteins was detected by immunofluorescence with anti-HA peptide-specific monoclonal antibody (Babco, Berkeley, CA) as described previously (36Furukawa K. Hotta Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted with Slow-Fade antifade component (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Slides were visualized on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope configured for epifluorescence illumination, photographed with Kodak TMAX ASA400 film, digitized with a UMAX scanner and prepared for printing on a Kodak Pictrography printer using Adobe Photoshop 3.05 software. GST-LAP2 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(pLysS). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 into LB medium containing 10 mmmagnesium sulfate, 1% glucose, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. When the culture density reached A600 = 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubation was continued for 45 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, resuspended in 1/20 volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl and frozen in liquid nitrogen. To prepare extracts, samples were thawed on ice, sonicated twice for 30 s, and cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Extracts were either used directly or purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by washing in alternating cycles of phosphate-buffered saline and phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 mm NaCl, followed by elution in phosphate-buffered saline and 15 mmreduced glutathione (Sigma). Protein samples were displayed on 12.5% acrylamide-SDS gels and stained with Coomassie Blue to assess the relative GST-LAP2 fusion content. NRK cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 atmosphere on coverslips in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan UT), and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). To obtain populations enriched in mitotic cells, cultures were grown for 11 h in media containing 2 mmthymidine (Sigma), after which the cells were washed and incubated a further 7 h in the presence of medium lacking thymidine. Samples were removed from the incubator, washed once in a physiologic buffer (TB, Ref. 37Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and then incubated for 5 min on ice in TB containing 10 μg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem). After two washes with TB and 10% bovine serum albumin to remove the digitonin, 100 μl of a glutathione affinity-purified GST-LAP2 fusion protein in TB and 10% bovine serum albumin was applied to each coverslip. After 15–20 min incubation at room temperature, samples were fixed immediately by the addition of 2 ml of 4% formaldehyde in TB for 5 min. Samples were subsequently prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (27Yang L. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), using goat anti-GST polyclonal serum (1:500, Pharmacia) as primary antibody, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled mouse anti-goat antibody (1:50, Pierce) as secondary antibody. Slides were analyzed as described above for the NE targeting assay. We recently found that a region in the nucleoplasmic domain of LAP2, extending from amino acid 298 to 373, is required for targeting of LAP2 to the NE in a form that is stable to extraction with Triton X-100 (10Furukawa K. Pante N. Aebi U. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because LAP2 could in principle reach the inner nuclear membrane by diffusion in the membrane bilayer from the peripheral ER (see “Discussion”) and because the nucleoplasmic domain of LAP2 is able to bind to lamins and chromosomes, this suggested that the targeting of LAP2 to the inner nuclear membrane could result from binding to one of these components. To explore this possibility further, we have mapped the regions of LAP2 involved in lamin and chromosome binding to determine whether either of these comaps with the region of LAP2 involved in NE targeting. We employed the yeast two-hybrid system (31Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) to identify the lamin binding region of LAP2. The full-length LAP2 open reading frame and a number of deletion variants were cloned into the GAL4-DNA binding domain fusion vector (Fig. 1) and were assayed in yeast in pairwise combinations with GAL4-transcription activation domain fusions containing human lamin B1 or lamin B2. In addition, certain LAP2 constructs were tested for interaction with control fusions containing the cytoplasmic intermediate filament vimentin or the yeast SNF4 protein. In this assay system, the binding of LAP2 fragments to lamin B activated a lacZ reporter gene. The activity of this gene was monitored qualitatively by direct plating on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside indicator plates for a blue/white color reaction and then was quantitated via direct assay of soluble yeast extracts for β-galactosidase enzyme activity (35Reynolds A. Lundblad V. Dorris D. Keareney M. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Protocols opinions in Molecular Biology. Greene and Wiley-Interscience, New York1993: 13.6.1-13.6.5Google Scholar). The results of these experiments are presented in Table I. Strains carrying the full-length LAP2 and either lamin B1 or B2 displayed blue color and high β-galactosidase levels indicative of lacZ reporter induction. Thus, LAP2 binds lamin B in the two-hybrid system in agreement with previous in vitrobiochemical studies (9Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). No binding was observed between LAP2 and the vimentin or SNF4 controls in the colony color and β-galactosidase assays, demonstrating the specificity of this interaction. Vimentin provides an especially good control for this interaction because vimentin is a member of the intermediate filament superfamily and has some sequence similarity to lamins but is cytoplasmic and is not colocalized with LAP2 in vivo. An interaction between LAP2 and vimentin also was not observed with in vitro binding assays using purified components (9Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar).Table IInteractions between LAP2 deletion fragments and lamin BGAL4-DNA binding domain fusionGAL4-activation domain fusionLamin B1Lamin B2SNF4VimentinFL9.4 /B15.3 /B0.41 /W0.32 /WΔC110.1 /B13.0 /B0.38 /W0.22 /WΔC20.13 /W0.30 /W— /W—ΔC30.14 /W0.75 /W— /W—ΔN314.9 /B10.9 /B— /W—ΔN40.15 /W0.14 /W— /W—ΔNC12.9 /B2.1 /B— /W—ΔNC33.1 /B2.9 /B0.59 /W—ΔNC49.2 /B8.9 /B— /W— /W Open table in a new tab From analysis of constructs that involved deletions of LAP2 from the COOH terminus, we determined that the COOH-terminal border of a sequence required for lamin binding is between amino acids 296 and 398 (compare ΔC1 and ΔC2). Furthermore, from examination of constructs containing deletions of LAP2 sequences from the NH2terminus, we found that sequences upstream of amino acid 298 are dispensable for lamin binding (compare ΔN3 and ΔN4). Further analysis demonstrated that the smallest LAP2 fragment that retained significant lamin binding activity contained amino acids 298–373 (ΔNC1). LacZ activation in the ΔNC1/lamin combination was not as high as full-length LAP2/lamin (2–3 units versus 10–15 units) but still was significantly above background (0.4–0.6 unit as judged by the signal obtained with SNF4). Sequences flanking the 298–373 element resulted in an increase in the LacZ signal (compare ΔNC1, ΔN3 and ΔNC4), but it is unclear whether these sequences contribute directly to lamin binding or influence binding indirectly because of effects on protein folding. Similar to these results, sequences flanking residues 298–373 also seemed to enhance stable NE targeting (10Furukawa K. Pante N. Aebi U. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In summary, these experiments reveal that the major lamin binding region of LAP2 occurs between residues 298 and 373, coinciding with the region that we found previously to be required for stable targeting of LAP2 to the inner NE. Whereas the region of LAP2 between residues 298 and 373 is necessary for stable targeting of transfected deletion mutants of LAP2 to the NE in cultured cells, this segment by itself (which lacks a membrane-spanning sequence) is not sufficient for NE targeting (10Furukawa K. Pante N. Aebi U. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To examine the NE targeting activity of this segment of LAP2 in a more physiological structural context, we fused the LAP2 lamin binding region to a polypeptide containing the transmembrane and partial lumenal domains of chicken hepatic lectin, a type II integral membrane protein like LAP2. Chicken hepatic lectin is localized to the ER and plasma membrane and is not targeted to the NE (32Drickamer K. Mamon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 15156-15161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Soullam B. Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The lectin fragment used contains amino acids 10–91 of the lectin protein, comprising 15 amino acids of the NH2-terminal sequence, a 30-amino acid hydrophobic segment containing the transmembrane domain, and a 36-amino acid fragment of the lumenal domain. This fusion construct (ΔNC1-TM) and control full-length LAP2 (FL) were expressed as HA-tagged proteins via transfection into cultured HeLa cells, and their localization was determined by immunofluorescent staining with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2). The full-length LAP2 was localized in a nuclear rim staining pattern characteristic of NE proteins together with some diffuse cytoplasmic staining (−Triton panel), in agreement with our previous observations (10Furukawa K. Pante N. Aebi U. Gerace L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the NE association was stable, as indicated by its resistance to extraction in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 100 mm NaCl (+Triton panel). Localization of ΔNC1-TM, the LAP2 lamin binding segment/chicken hepatic lectin chimera, revealed nuclear rim staining along with a lower level of cytoplasmic staining. The nuclear rim staining was stable to Triton extraction, indicating that the chimera was stably targeted to the NE, whereas the cytoplasmic staining was almost entirely removed by this treatment. Thus, the lamin binding region of LAP2 is sufficient to target a heterologous polypeptide containing a transmembrane and partial lumenal domain to the NE in a Triton-stable fashion. To determine whether the chromosome binding region of LAP2 can be distinguished from its major NE targeting/lamin binding domain, we mapped the region of LAP2 which interacts with chromosomes using an in situ binding assay with mitotic cells. For this, cultures of coverslip-attached normal rat kidney cells that were enriched in mitotic populations (see “Experimental Procedures”) were permeabilized by treatment with digitonin and were incubated with recombinant GST fusion proteins containing various regions of LAP2 (Fig. 3). The cells were then fixed and labeled with an anti-GST antibody, and the association of the GST-LAP2 fusions with the chromosomes of mitotic cells was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. A SDS gel displaying the recombinant GST-LAP2 fusion proteins purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads is shown in Fig. 3 B. Despite extensive efforts (see “Experimental Procedures”), we were unable to eliminate partial proteolysis of the GST-LAP2 constructs in bacteria. The amount of proteolysis ranged from <5% of total protein (ΔG1, ΔG3 in Fig.3 B) to approximately 70% (ΔG5 in Fig. 3 B). Protein amounts in each experiment were normalized such that an equal amount of each intact GST-LAP2 fusion protein was introduced into the binding assay. The results of this chromosome binding experiment are shown in Fig.4. A fusion protein containing the complete nucleoplasmic domain of LAP2 (ΔC1) strongly bound to the chromosomes of permeabilized mitotic cells, whereas no binding was detected with GST alone. The mitotic cells in these cell populations were readily detectable by phase-contrast microscopy, which clearly revealed the condensed mitotic chromosomes (e.g. arrowheads in Fig. 4, GST panel). With our experimental conditions, substantial chromosome binding was observed with as little as 15 nm GST-LAP2 fusion protein. No structures in the surrounding interphase c"

Natl. Acad. Sci. 89, 6599 – 6603, 1992; Zhang and Kumar, Biochem. Biophysi. Res. Comm., 200, 522 – 528, 1994). In the studies presented here, we investigated the mechanism of inhibition of CDKs in IFN-treated cells by delineating the potential role(s) of CDK-inhibitors (CKIs) and CDK-activating kinase (CAK). We report that IFN-α inhibits the H-1 kinase activity associated with CDK-4 or CDK-2 due to induction of expression of CDK-inhibitor p21WAF1 (but not p27Kip1) as its immunodepletion from IFN-treated extracts restored the CDK-associated H-1 kinase activity. In addition, we also show that IFN-γ induces expression of CDK-inhibitors p21WAF1 and p27Kip1 and inhibited the H-1 kinase activity associated with CDK-2 or CDK-4. The observed IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of CDK-2 and CDK-4 kinase activity was due to enhanced interactions with p21WAF1 and p27Kip1, respectively. We also demonstrated that IFN-induced CKIs prevent CAK from activating the CDK-2 as immunodepletion of induced CKIs from the inhibitory extracts resulted in the restoration of CAK-mediated activation of CDK-2."

Although the function of many of these proteins remains to be determined, it is clear that different MDC proteins are capable of performing a variety of important tasks. To date, MDC proteins have been implicated in two distinct membrane binding and fusion events. Fertilin, which functions in sperm-egg binding and fusion, is a heterodimeric complex of two MDC proteins, fertilin α and fertilin β. A monoclonal antibody against fertilin β blocks sperm-egg fusion (2Primakoff P. Hyatt H. Tredick-Kline J. J.

In C2C12 mouse muscle cells, an MDC protein called meltrin α has been found to play a role in the membrane fusion event that gives rise to multinucleated myotubes (6Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The involvement of MDC proteins in sperm-egg fusion and in muscle cell fusion suggests that MDC proteins are closely linked to the process of membrane fusion, either by mediating a prerequisite binding or signaling step, or by directly triggering the membrane fusion event via a predicted fusion peptide (27Huovila A.-P.J.

Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), we further investigated the expression of meltrin β and of the three other metalloprotease-disintegrins, meltrin α, mdc9, and mdc15 (metargidin), in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Our results demonstrate that all four MDC genes are expressed in osteoblasts and that the expression of meltrin β is inducible by 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol). Furthermore, expression of meltrin α and meltrin β appears to be regulated during osteoblast differentiation. Neither meltrin α, which has been implicated in muscle fusion, nor meltrin β is detectable in in vitro-generated osteoclast-like cells (OCLs), which arise from the fusion of mononuclear precursors of the monocyte/macrophage/osteoclast lineage. Therefore, we conclude that Meltrin α and Meltrin β may not play a role in osteoclast fusion but instead are more likely involved in osteoblast differentiation and/or osteoblast activity in bone. mRNA from ∼20% fused mouse C2C12 cells (28Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) was used to synthesize a cDNA library, utilizing the Stratagene ZAP cDNA library synthesis kit (according to the manufacturer's instructions; see also Ref. 29Krätzschmar J. Haendler B. Langer G. Boidol W. Bringmann P. Alagon A. Donner P. Schleuning W.D. Gene. 1991; 105: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The unamplifed cDNA library was screened under high stringency conditions with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe for meltrin β, which was generated as follows: nested reverse transcription-PCR was performed on C2C12 cDNA (see above) with the following primers designed from the published partial meltrin β sequence (6Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar): primer 1 (sense primer), GAGGAATGT GACTGTGGAGA; primer 2 (sense primer), GTGACCTCCC CGAGTTCTGC; and primer 3 (antisense primer), CAGTTTCCAT AGGTGTCACC. Primers 1 and 3 were used in a primary reaction, which was diluted 1:400 and used as template for a secondary reaction with primers 2 and 3, performed in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Using this probe, 20 positive cDNA clones were identified from 106plaques screened. A PCR analysis with the pBluescript vector-specific T3 primer (Stratagene), and a 5′ antisense primer (TTCAGAGCCA CGTTGGAGGC), designed from the previously published partialmeltrin β sequence (6Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), was carried out to find the clone with the longest 5′ extension. The longest clone thus identified was subjected to in vitro excision, sequenced completely on both strands using a primer walk approach, and found to have a cDNA insert of 6413 base pairs. The initial methionine residue of the deduced meltrin β protein sequence is followed by a hydrophobic predicted signal sequence and an apparently full-length open reading frame encoding a protein with 920 amino acid residues. Analysis of the mouse meltrin β cDNA and translated protein sequences was performed using MacVector sequence analysis software (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems), and the alignment and hydrophobicity plot was generated using DNASTAR software (Megalign and Protean program modules). Using the same approach, meltrin α cDNA was cloned from the library as a template to make cRNA for RNase protection studies (see below). The following PCR primers were used in a nested reaction to generate the [α-32P]dCTP labeled cDNA probe, which corresponds to nucleotides 298–500 of themeltrin α sequence cited in Ref. 6Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar (GenBank accession no.D50411): primer 1 (sense primer), ATGGCAGAGC GCCCGGCGCG; primer 2 (sense primer), CGTGCAGCCC GAGGGATGAG; primer 3 (antisense primer), CATTGGCAAT GAGTCCCTCA; and primer 4 (antisense primer), AGTGAGAGAG ACATCAGTAC. Primers 1 and 4 were used in a primary reaction, which was subsequently diluted 1:400 and used as template for a secondary reaction with primers 2 and 3, performed in the presence of [α-32P]dCT. The resulting labeled cDNA probe was used to isolate two cDNA clones for meltrin α out of 106 plaques screened. One of the cDNA clones contained an open reading frame that was judged to be full-length based on the presence of the meltrin α signal sequence, as determined by sequencing the 5′ end of both clones with the vector-specific T3 primer (Stratagene). Mouse tissue Northern blots were obtained fromCLONTECH and probed with a PCR-generated32P-labeled mouse meltrin β cDNA under high stringency conditions as described previously (20Weskamp G. Blobel C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2748-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For RNase protection assays, total RNA was extracted from various bone cells according to the previously described method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar), and the concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry. To prepare cRNA probes, cDNA fragments of mouse mdc9 (anXhoI/EcoRI fragment from nucleotide 106 to nucleotide 309 (14Weskamp G. Krätzschmar J.R. Reid M. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)), meltrin α (anAflII/HindIII fragment from nucleotide 842 to nucleotide 1091 (6Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A.

AF006196), the calcitonin receptor (from nucleotide 1156 to nucleotides 1677 (31Yamin M. Gorn A.H. Flannery M.R. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Tapp D.R. Krane S.M. Goldring S.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) and GAPDH (from nucleotide 521 to nucleotides 660) were subcloned into the appropriate sites in a pBluescript II vector (Stratagene) and transcribed in vitro in the antisense direction by T7 or T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. Cold UTP was also added to the reaction for GAPDH to reduce the specific activity of the probe to approximately one tenth. Multiprobe RNase protection assays were performed using RPA II kit (Ambion, Inc., Woodward, TX) according to the protocol suggested by the supplier. 10 μg of total RNA was incubated with two or more labeled cRNA probes (20,000–50,000 cpm per reaction for each probe) in a single tube at 42 °C for 16 h. After digesting single-stranded RNA with a mixture of RNase A (5 units/ml) and RNase T (200 units/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, protected RNA fragments were precipitated, resolved on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Two New Zealand White rabbits were immunized using a GST fusion protein with the N-terminal half of themeltrin β cytoplasmic domain (amino acid residues 728–817), and two rabbits were immunized with a GST fusion protein with the C-terminal half of the cytoplasmic tail (corresponding to amino acid residues 818–920). The fusion protein expression constructs were assembled using PCR primers with added restriction sites to allow in-frame cloning into the pGEX/4T-3 GST fusion vector (Pharmacia LKB). Antibodies were raised by Animal Pharm (Healdsburg, CA) according to established protocols (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-138Google Scholar). A murine macrophage cell line, IC21, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. C2C12 cells (28Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% chick embryo extract (growth medium) for 2 days, and myogenic differentiation and fusion were induced by adding Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). A murine osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3E1 (33Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. R. T. Franceschi (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), and was grown in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary osteoblastic cells were isolated from calvariae of newborn CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) by digestion with 0.1% collagenase type IA (Sigma) and 0.2% dispase (Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously (34Takahashi N.T. Akatsu T. Udagawa N. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2600-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells were obtained from tibiae and femurs of 8–12-week-old CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories). To generate OCLs in vitro, 2 × 107 marrow cells were cocultured with 2 × 106 primary osteoblasts in a 10-cm culture dish in the presence of 10 nm 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) (34Takahashi N.T. Akatsu T. Udagawa N. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2600-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). After 6 days, cells were treated sequentially with 0.1% collagenase/0.2% dispase and 5 mm EDTA to remove osteoblastic cells; OCLs remained strongly attached to the culture dish. These OCLs have virtually all of the characteristics of authentic osteoclasts, such as the ability to resorb bone, and the expression of lineage-specific markers, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, a specific marker for cells of the osteoclast lineage (35Minkin C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1982; 34: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), and the calcitonin receptor (36Suda T. Takahashi N. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 66-80PubMed Google Scholar). In this coculture system, formation of OCLs is totally dependent on the presence of calcitriol. In every preparation, more than 80% of the OCL-enriched population was positively stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. A pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) for meltrin β was constructed by subcloning an EcoRI/HindIII fragment, which contains the full-length meltrin β open reading frame. The EcoRI site is part of the 5′ linker sequence in a λ ZAP library, and the HindIII site is at nucleotide 2883, just downstream of the meltrin β stop codon at nucleotide 2808. The meltrin β pcDNA3 expression vector, or an identical control vector without an insert, were used to transfect COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE reagent as a delivery vehicle (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transiently transfected cells were harvested after 3 days in tissue culture, and expression of meltrin β was monitored by Western blot analysis as described below. Protein A-purified IgG was isolated from antisera raised against GST fusion proteins with either the C-terminal or the N-terminal part of the meltrin β cytoplasmic domain (see above). Meltrin β-specific antibodies were affinity-purified using the appropriate fusion protein coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL4B (Pharmacia LKB, coupling performed according to the manufacturer's instructions). The IgG sample that remained after affinity purification and had effectively been depleted of meltrin β-specific antibodies was used as a control for some Western blots. The affinity-purified IgG, the control IgG, and the complete antiserum and preimmune antiserum were tested by Western blot analysis on COS-7 cells expressingmeltrin β from a pcDNA3 vector or on control COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3 vector lacking an insert. The affinity-purified and control antibodies were also used on a lysate of C2C12 mouse myoblasts that included about 20% fused multinucleated cells. The Western blot of a primary osteoblast (POB) lysate was probed with immune or preimmune serum at a 1:500 dilution, which produced a stronger signal than the affinity-purified antibodies under the conditions used here. All cells were lysed at a concentration of 4 × 106/ml in cell lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS and protease inhibitors (3Blobel C.P. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar)). Following lysis, nuclei were removed by spinning at 13,000 rpm in a Sorvall tabletop centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C. COS-7 cell lysates devoid of nuclei were mixed with 2× sample loading buffer immediately, whereas C2C12 and POB lysates were incubated with 100 μl of Concanavalin A-Sepharose (Pharmacia, LKB) per 1 ml extract for 1 h at 4 °C to enrich for glycoproteins. Bound glycoproteins were eluted in 1× sample buffer after three washes in cell lysis buffer. Prior to electrophoresis, all samples were denatured and reduced by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in the presence of 50 mm dithiothreitol and subsequently alkylated by incubation with 100 mm iodo-acetic acid. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semidry blotting apparatus (E&K, Saratoga, CA). Blotted protein samples were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk dissolved in PBS, incubated in primary and secondary antibody in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, washed in PBS, 0.5% Tween. Bound antibodies were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) in combination with a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Corp.) and Kodak XAR autoradiography film (Eastman Kodak Co.). In initial tests for specificity on Western blots of meltrin β-transfected COS-7 cells, all four antisera (two each raised against the C-terminal and the N-terminal half of the meltrin β cytoplasmic tail) recognized a band of 115 kDa (data not shown), in addition to other, faster migrating bands. These bands were not visible on blots of COS-7 cells transfected with the vector alone. For all Western blots presented here, antibodies raised against the C-terminal part of the meltrin β cytoplasmic tail from one of the two rabbits were used, because these antibodies reacted with the least number of nonspecific bands (defined as bands that were also present in nontranfected COS-7 cell lysates or as bands that were not recognized by all four antisera). A cDNA clone coding for full-length mouse Meltrin β was first isolated from a mouse C2C12 muscle cell library, using a PCR-generated cDNA fragment as a probe (see “Materials and Methods”) and then sequenced using a primer walk approach. This clone had an insert of 6413 base pairs, with an open reading frame of 2760 base pairs, 35 base pairs of 5′ untranslated sequence, and 3618 base pairs of 3′ untranslated sequence. The meltrin β protein sequence, as deduced from the open reading frame, predicts a protein of 920 amino acid residues with four sites of N-linked glycosylation. The sequence of Meltrin β contains all protein modules that are characteristic of members of the MDC protein family: a signal sequence is followed by a prodomain, a metalloprotease domain with a predicted catalytic site consensus sequence (HEIGHNFGMSHD), a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region, an epidermal growth factor-like repeat, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Like several other MDC proteins, such as MDC9 (14Weskamp G. Krätzschmar J.R. Reid M. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), meltrin α (6Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A.

Distinct classes of GPI are present as membrane anchors for several surface glycoproteins and an abundant lipophosphoglycan as well as being the major glycolipids (GIPLs) in the plasma membrane. In this study we have identified putative precursors for the protein and lipophosphoglycan anchors and delineated the complete pathway for GIPL biosynthesis in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes. Based on the structural analyses of these GPI intermediates and their kinetics of labeling in vivo and in cell-free systems, we provide evidence that the GIPLs are the products of an independent biosynthetic pathway rather than being excess precursors of the anchor pathways. First, we show that the similar glycan head groups of the GIPL and protein/lipophosphoglycan anchor precursors are assembled on two distinct pools of PI corresponding to 1-O-(C18:0)alkyl-2-stearoyl-PI and 1-O-(C24:0/C26:0)-2-stearoyl-PI, respectively. These PI species account for 20 and 1% of the total PI pool, respectively, indicating a remarkable specificity in their selection. Second, analysis of the flux of intermediates through these pathways in vivo and in a cell-free system suggests that the GIPL and anchor pathways are independently regulated. We also show that GIPL biosynthesis requires fatty acid remodeling, in which thesn-2 stearoyl chains are replaced with myristoyl or lauroyl chains. Fatty acid remodeling is dependent on CoA and ATP and occurs on pre-existing but not on de novo synthesized GIPLs. We suggest that the compartmentalization of different GPI pathways may be important in regulating the species and stage-specific expression of different GPI structures in these parasites.

GPI 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PI, phosphatidylinositol; IPC, inositol phosphoceramide; GIPL, glycoinositol phospholipid; HPAEC, high pH anion exchange chromatography; LPG, lipophosphoglycan; TLCK, N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; HPTLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALD-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry. The nomenclature used to describe the L. mexicana GIPLs and GPI precursors is as follows (see Fig. 13 for structures): the letter M and numbers 1–4 refer to the number of mannose residues in each structure. The prefix “i” indicates the presence of an α1–3-linked mannose branch on the mannose proximal to glucosamine (the iso series) (29Schneider P. Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Structures without the i prefix lack this branch and have part or all of the structure Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN-PI. The prefix “EP” indicates the presence of an ethanolamine-phosphate residue on the glycan backbone (13McConville M.J. Collidge T.A.C. Ferguson M.A.J. Schneider P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15595-15604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the subscript “VLAC” refers to GPI species which contain 1-O-alkylglycerols with very long alkyl chains (C24:0, C26:0). HPTLC-derived fractions used in this study are denoted by a band number and the major composite GPI species. glycolipids are important membrane constituents in all eukaryotic cells. They anchor a variety of proteins to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and may also have a role in the intracellular trafficking, transmembrane signaling, and intercellular transport of these proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 3Medof M.E. Nagarjan S. Tykocinski M.L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 574-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Non-protein-linked GPI glycolipids may also be abundant in the plasma membrane, although the function and biosynthetic relationship between these glycolipids and the anchor GPIs in higher eukaryotes is unclear (4van't Hof W. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Menon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24150-24155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Sevlever D. Humphrey D.R. Rosenberry T.L. Eur. J.

Biol. chem. 1996; 271: 12879-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GPI glycolipids are particularly abundant in lower eukaryotes such as yeast and the parasitic protozoa where they are commonly utilized as membrane anchors for the major surface proteins (2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In the trypanosomatid parasites, non-protein-linked GPIs can also be the major cellular glycolipids (2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). This is the case for the sandfly-transmittedLeishmania parasites which cause a range of important diseases in humans. Leishmania parasites alternate between a flagellated promastigote stage that resides within the digestive tract of the sandfly vector and a non-motile amastigote stage that proliferates within the phagolysosome of macrophages in the mammalian host. The major macromolecule on the promastigote surface is a complex lipophosphoglycan (LPG), which contains a polydisperse phosphoglycan chain and a novel GPI anchor with the structure Gal3(Glc-1-PO4)Man2GlcN-lyso-PI (Fig. 1) (2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 7Turco S.J. Descoteaux A. Annu. Rev.

This anchor is distinct from the protein anchors of Leishmania and other eukaryotes, which have the core structure: ethanolamine-PO4-Man3GlcN-PI (Fig. 1) (2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 9Schneider P. Ferguson M.A.J. McConville M.J. Melhert A. Homans S.W. Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16955-16964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite these differences in glycan structure, both the protein and LPG anchors contain a PI lipid moiety which is highly enriched for 1-O-alkylglycerols with very long (C24:0 or C26:0) alkyl chains (7Turco S.J. Descoteaux A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 65-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8McConville M.J. Schnur L.F. Jaffe C. Schneider P. Biochem.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16955-16964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LPGs are essential virulence factors which have been shown to mediate the attachment of promastigotes to the insect midgut and mammalian macrophages, protect the parasite surface in these hostile environments, and modulate signal transduction pathways involved in activating various microbicidal processes in the host macrophage (2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 7Turco S.J. Descoteaux A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 65-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the surface expression of both the LPG- and GPI-anchored proteins is massively down-regulated in the intracellular amastigote stages of several species (10Medina-Acosta E. Karess R.E. Schwartz H. Russell D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 37: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11McConville M.J. Blackwell J.M. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1993; 58: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting that the surface expression of these macromolecules is either not required or not compatible for life in the macrophage phagolysosome. Leishmania spp. also synthesize glycoinositol phospholipids (GIPLs), a family of low molecular weight GPI glycolipids which are not linked to either protein or polysaccharide. Unlike the LPG- and GPI-anchored proteins, the GIPLs are major surface constituents (107 copies/cell) on both the promastigote and amastigote stages (11McConville M.J. Blackwell J.M. J. Biol.

Depending on the species and developmental stage, the glycan moieties of the GIPLs may be homologous to the protein anchors (type I GIPLs), the LPG anchors (type 2 GIPLs), or contain elements of both anchors (hybrid type) (2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Despite having similar glycan moieties to the protein or LPG anchors, the GIPLs characteristically have distinct lipid compositions which are often enriched with alkylacyl-PI containing shorter C18:0-alkyl chains (11McConville M.J.

Less is known about the function of the GIPLs, but as the major cell surface constituents of the amastigote stage they may have specific role(s) in protecting the parasite surface and/or modulating signal transduction pathways in the macrophage (14Winter G.

However, structurally related GIPLs are also abundant in the plasma membranes of other trypanosomatid organisms which have quite different hosts (ranging from humans to insects and plants) (2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 18Redman C.A. Schneider P. Mehlert A. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that these glycolipids may have a more general function in regulating the physicochemical properties of cellular membranes. The biosynthesis of protein anchor precursors has been extensively studied in a number of protozoan parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei (19Masterson W.J. Raper J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21446-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the biosynthesis of the non-protein-linked GPI glycolipids in these organisims. In particular, nothing is known about the relationship between the different GPI anchor pathways in Leishmania and whether the GIPLs represent excess intermediates from these pathways or whether they are the products of a separate pathway. Two recent studies in Leishmania major suggest that the early steps in GIPL/LPG anchor biosynthesis are the same as those involved in protein anchor biosynthesis, involving the transfer of GlcNAc to a PI precursor to form GlcNAc-PI, followed by the de-N-acetylation of GlcNAc and transfer of a mannose residue to form Manα1–4GlcN-PI (25Proudfoot L. Schneider P. Ferguson M.A.J. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Smith T.K. Milne F.C. Sharma D.K. Crossman A. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Other intermediates, which are likely to be precursors of the LPG anchor and type-2 GIPLs have also been partially characterized. However, because the mature products of these pathways have identical core structures, it has been difficult to determine whether the LPG anchors and the GIPLs of this species are synthesized by the same or two different pathways. In the present study, we have investigated the biosynthesis of both the anchor and free GPIs in L. mexicana promastigotes. We have previously shown that the hybrid type GIPLs of this species have glycan and lipid moieties that are distinct from both the protein and LPG anchors (Fig. 1) (13McConville M.J. Collidge T.A.C.

Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6834-6840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) making it possible to distinguish between intermediates from different pathways. We show that the distinct alkyl chain compositions of the L. mexicana anchor GPIs and the GIPLs are acquired by the selection of different pools of PI precursor species. In contrast, the short sn-2 acyl chains are incorporated into the GIPLs and protein anchors via highly specific fatty acid remodeling of later intermediates. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the anchor GPIs probably share a set of common early intermediates, whereas the GIPLs are the products of a completely separate pathway. The implications of these results for understanding the stage-specific regulation of GPI biosynthesis in Leishmania are discussed. Materials were obtained as follows: ATP and coenzyme A were from Sigma. Jack bean α-mannosidase and Bacillus cereus phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C were from Boehringer Mannheim. [2-3H]Mannose (17 Ci/mmol), [6-3H]glucosamine (2 Ci/mmol), [6-3H]glucose (3.1 Ci/mmol), [9,10-3H]myristic acid (11.2 Ci/mmol), [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (35.9 Ci/mmol), [1-14C]stearic acid (55 mCi/mmol), and GDP-[2-3H]Man (7 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products Inc. [14C]Octadecanol (52 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals and [3H]ethanolamine (28 Ci/mmol) from Amersham. Promastigotes of L. mexicana (strain MNYC/BZ/62/M379) were routinely cultivated at 27 °C in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For labeling with [3H]inositol or [3H]ethanolamine, mid-log growth phase promastigotes were resuspended in RPMI-fetal bovine serum medium (5 × 106 cell/ml) containing 10 μCi of [3H]inositol/ml or 20 μCi of [3H]ethanolamine and cultivated for 12–20 h (steady state labeling) at 27 °C before harvesting. For pulse-chase labeling of promastigotes with [3H]Man or [3H]GlcN, parasites were harvested by centrifugation and preincubated in RPMI containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 μl/ml tunicamycin for 30 min at 27 °C. Cells were washed with glucose-free RPMI containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 μl/ml tunicamycin and preincubated in the same medium for 10 min at 27 °C before addition of either [3H]Man (50 μCi/ml) or [3H]GlcN (20 μCi/ml). After 5 min, cells were rapidly harvested by brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (5,000 × g, 30 s) and resuspended at 108 cells/ml in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml tunicamycin. Aliquots (5 × 107 cell equivalents) were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 30 s) at defined time intervals and the GPI glycolipids extracted from the cell pellets as described below. For labeling with the [3H]- and [14C]fatty acids and [14C]octadecanol, promastigotes were harvested and washed with RPMI medium containing 2 mg/ml defatted bovine serum albumin. Fatty acids were added after 20 min preincubation in this medium, as an equimolar complex with defatted bovine serum albumin and aliquots (5 × 107 cell equivalents) of cell suspension removed at defined time intervals. In the pulse-chase experiment described in Fig. 5, promastigotes were labeled with [3H]myristic acid for 2 min, then resuspended in fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and defatted bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) loaded with unlabeled myristic acid (1:1 molar complex). Aliquots were removed immediately and at the designated time points for processing. Cell pellets were extracted twice in 300 μl of chloroform, methanol, water (1:2:0.8, v/v), with intermittent sonication for 2 h at 25 °C and insoluble material removed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min). The combined supernatants were dried under a stream of N2, and GPIs recovered by being partitioned in a biphasic system of 1-butanol (200 μl) and water (100 μl). After centrifugation (16,000 × g, 30 s), the lower aqueous phase was washed once with water-saturated 1-butanol (200 μl) and the combined organic phases back-extracted with water (150 μl) before being dried in a Speed-Vac (Savant) concentrator. GPI glycolipids recovered in the 1-butanol phase were resuspended in 40% 1-propanol for HPTLC analyses. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5, LPG was extracted from the delipidated pellet of [3H]Man-labeled promastigotes in 9% aqueous 1-butanol (2 × 300 μl) and purified on a small column (1 ml) of octyl-Sepharose (28McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19611-19623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dephosphorylated LPG anchor was obtained by mild acid hydrolysis of this extract in 40 mmtrifluoroacetic acid (12 min, 100 °C), digestion of the hydrolysate with alkaline phosphatase (20 units/50 μl) in 0.5 mammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 (18 h, 37 °C), and separation of the anchor from labeled LPG repeat units on a mini octyl-Sepharose column as described above (28McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19611-19623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Promastigotes were preincubated in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml tunicamycin for 30 min at 27 °C, then hypotonically permeabilized in water containing 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm TLCK, 0.1 μmleupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol (108 cells/ml) for 10 min at 0 °C. Permeabilized cells were pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and resuspended (109 cell equivalents/ml) in 50 mmHepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm TLCK, 0.1 μm leupeptin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A). Labelings were initiated by adding 10 μl of GDP-[3H]Man (0.5 μCi) and UDP-GlcNAc (10 mm) to 50 μl of permeabilized cells. After 10 min, the label was chased by adding an equal volume of buffer A containing 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc and 1 mm GDP-Man. Aliquots (108 cell equivalents) were removed at the beginning and at the indicated time points during the chase for extraction of GPIs. In some experiments, the assay buffer contained CoA (0.2 mm) and myristic acid (0.1 mm). For labeling experiments with [3H]myristic and [3H]palmitic acids, permeabilized cells were suspended in buffer A containing CoA (0.2 mm), GDP-Man (1 mm), UDP-GlcNAc (1 mm) and added to a microcentrifuge tube in which 100 μCi of fatty acid (suspended in ethanol) had been dried. The cell suspension was vortex mixed gently and incubated at 20 °C for 30 min before extraction of lipids and processing as described above. Samples were applied to Silica Gel 60 aluminum-backed HPTLC plates (Merck). Unless otherwise stated all samples containing GPI glycolipids were analyzed on plates developed for 10 cm in chloroform, methanol, 1 mammonium acetate, 13 m NH4OH, water (180:140:9:9:23, v/v) (solvent A). For analysis of the phosphorylated LPG anchor, plates were developed in chloroform, methanol, 0.2% KCl (10:10:3, v/v) followed by 1-butanol, pyridine, 0.25% KCl (9:6:4, v/v) in the same dimension (28McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19611-19623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of glycans released by nitrous acid deamination, the HPTLC sheets were developed in 1-propanol, acetone, water (9:6:5, v/v) (solvent B) (29Schneider P. Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HPTLC plates were sprayed with EN3HANCETM (DuPont) and exposed to either XAR-5 or BioMax (Kodak) film. To quantitate incorporation of radiolabel into individual species, HPTLC plates were either scanned before fluorography on a Berthold LB2821 automatic TLC linear analyzer, or the intensity of bands on preflashed film determined by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics 300A densitometer. In experiments described in Fig. 5, the Man2GlcN-PI and Man3GlcN-PI complexes from each time point were scraped from the HPTLC sheet after fluorography and the glycans obtained by nitrous acid deamination/reduction reanalyzed and quantitated by HPTLC and Dionex HPAEC, respectively, to determine incorporation of [3H]Man into the various comigrating species. For preparative purification of GPIs and inositol lipids, 2-mm bands of silica were scraped and extracted with chloroform, methanol, water (1:2:0.8, v/v) with intermittent sonication and each fraction reanalyzed by HPTLC. Digestion with B. cereus PI-specific phospholipase C was performed in 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.16% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate for 15 h at 37 °C. Jack bean α-mannosidase (50 units/ml) digestions were performed in 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.0, containing 0.2% taurodeoxycholic acid for 15 h at 37 °C. Mild base hydrolysis was performed in 0.1 m methanolic-NaOH (50 μl) for 2 h at 37 °C and samples neutralized with 1 m acetic acid. In each case the lipidic products of these treatments were recovered by 1-butanol, water biphase partitioning as described above. The HPTLC-purified glycolipids or crude lipid extracts were dried in a Speed-Vac concentrator and resuspended with sonication in freshly prepared 0.5m NaNO2 in 0.5 m NaOAc buffer, pH 4.0 (20 μl), and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. Two further additions of NaNO2 in NaOAc buffer, pH 4.0 (15 μl), were made at 1-h intervals, before the mixture was extracted with 100 μl of water-saturated 1-butanol to remove uncleaved GPIs (less than 5% of total). The pH of the aqueous phase was adjusted to pH 10 with 5m NaOH and the released glycans reduced by addition of NaBH4 (20 mg/ml) in 0.1 m NH4OH and incubation for 2 h at 25 °C. Excess NaBH4 was destroyed by addition of 1 m acetic acid and the samples desalted by passage down a column of AG50 × 12 (H+) and repeated (× 5) drying of the eluent with methanol. The deaminated/reduced glycans were analyzed by HPTLC (see above), or Dionex HPAEC. HPAEC was performed using a CarboPac PA1 column on a Dionex HPLC, equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector. The column was eluted with 0.15 m NaOH, 12.5 mm sodium acetate for 1 min, then with a linear gradient of sodium acetate (12.5–55 mm) in 0.15 m NaOH over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min (28McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19611-19623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elution time of labeled species was determined relative to a mixture of coinjected dextran oligomers (detected by PAD) and expressed as glucose units. HPTLC-purified GPIs and inositol lipids were analyzed on a Kratos MALDI-IV in negative ion mode. Lipid and glycolipid samples in 60% 1-propanol (0.5 μl of 1 mmsolution) were analyzed in 0.5 μl of freshly prepared α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (25 mg/ml) in 60% 1-propanol. Calibration was carried out with previously defined GIPL standards. HPTLC-purified samples were subjected to solvolysis in 0.5 m methanolic-HCl (50 μl) for 12 h at 80 °C. Samples were neutralized with 10 μl of pyridine, dried under vacuum, and derivatized with pyridine, hexamethyldisilazane, trimethylchlorosilane (9:3:1, v/v) for 10 min at 25 °C. The fatty acid methyl esters and the trimethylsilyl-derivatives of the released sugars and 1-O-alkylglycerols were detected by GC-MS, as described previously (15McConville M.J. Homans S.W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Dell A. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7385-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using either a HP1 (Hewlett Packard) or a SE-54 (Alltech) capillary column. Previous analyses have shown that the GPI anchors and GIPLs of L. mexicana promastigotes contain alkylacyl-PI (or lyso-alkyl-PI) with C18:0 (in the GIPLs) or C24:0 and C26:0 (in the LPG and protein anchors) alkyl chains. The sn-2 fatty acyl composition of the GIPLs and protein anchors has not been examined in detail. To determine to what extent these distinctive PI moieties are represented of the total PI pool, we have analyzed the molecular species composition of promastigote PI and also re-examined the acyl chain composition of the GIPLs. After steady state labeling with [3H]inositol, PI accounted for 58% of the inositol lipids (Fig. 2 A, first lane). Mild base hydrolysis of this fraction showed that approximately 80% of the PI contained a base-sensitive diacylglycerol lipid, while 20% comigrated with lyso-PI, indicating the presence of an alkylacylglycerol lipid (Fig. 2 A, second lane). Analysis of HPTLC-purified PI by MALDI-TOF-MS produced one major pseudomolecular ion at m/z 864 and minor ions at m/z 836 and 850 (Fig. 2 B). These ions corresponded to the [M-1]− pseudomolecular ion of distearoyl-PI, stearoyl-palmitoyl-PI, and 1-O-(C18:0)alkyl-2-O-stearoyl-PI, respectively, as judged by GC-MS compositional analysis (data not shown). The presence of the latter species was confirmed by analysis of the base-treated fraction, which generated a single [M-1]−pseudomolecular ion at m/z 584, the expected mass of 1-O-(C18:0)alkyl-2-lyso-PI (Fig. 2 C). Alkylacyl-PI molecular species with C24:0 and C26:0 alkyl chains accounted for less than 5% of the plasmanyl-PI, as determined by GC-MS, and were not detected by the less sensitive MALDI-TOF-MS analyses. In contrast, the [3H]inositol-labeled GIPL species, iM2, iM3, and iM4, contained exclusively alkylacylglycerol lipids, as shown by their reduced HPTLC mobility after base treatment (Fig. 2 A, second lane). GC-MS and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses confirmed the presence of exclusively C18:0 alkyl chains in these glycolipids, but also revealed the presence of a distinct sn-2 fatty acyl composition. For example, the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of iM2 (Manα1–3Manα1–4GlcN-PI) contained one major [M-1]−pseudomolecular ion at m/z 1281 and a minor ion at 1252 (Fig. 3 A). After base treatment only a single pseudomolecular ion was detected atm/z 1071 (Fig. 3 B), which is the correct mass for Hex2HexN-1-O-(C18:0)alkyl-2-lyso-PI. These data suggest that iM2 contains either 1-O-(C18:0)alkyl-2-myristoylglycerol (90%) or 1-O-(C18:0)alkyl-2-lauroylglycerol, which accounted for 95 and 5% of the molecular species, respectively, as judged by GC-MS compositional analysis. Identical lipid compositions were found in the other two major GIPL species, iM3 and iM4 (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus the lipid moieties of the GIPLs differ from those of the major alkylacyl-PI pool in"
https://openalex.org/W2002813441,"The specific loss of pRB or p107 together with p130 disrupts the normal development of only a very limited spectrum of tissues. These developmental defects have been attributed primarily to deregulation of E2F activity and consequent uncontrolled proliferation. We hypothesized, however, that the tissue-specific nature of these defects may also reflect deregulation of pRB-family associated factors that are specifically involved in determining cell fate. We report here that the pRB-family members interact with transcription factors which contain paired-like homeodomains such as MHox, Chx10 and Pax-3. The interaction between the pRB-family and the paired-like homeodomain proteins was initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen where the N-terminal portion of p130 was used to isolate interacting factors from an embryonic mouse library. This interaction was confirmed by in vitro binding and co-immunoprecipitation assays. We show further that co-expression of Pax-3 dependent pRB, p107 or p130 with Pax-3 causes repression of activated transcription from the c-met promoter. These data demonstrate that the pRB-family proteins can modulate the activity of factors which specifically control cell fate and/or differentiation as well as controlling cell cycle regulators."
https://openalex.org/W1993399024,Mutations of the p53 gene are associated with a number of non-lymphoid cancers of the dog. The present study investigates the p53 gene status within canine patients treated for primary and secondary lymphoma. Three out of eight patients exhibited p53 gene mutations. These included one patient with a germ line mutation and two patients with de novo p53 mutations associated with the secondary lymphoma. Allelic loss of the p53 gene was also observed within primary and secondary tumours of the three canine patients. The results indicate that germ line p53 mutations exist in dogs and may be involved in the known predisposition of some breeds to cancer. The presence of therapy-related p53 point mutations was found to be associated with chemoresistant secondary lymphomas. A causative role for DNA-damaging chemotherapy in de novo mutation of the p53 gene is discussed. Characterization of p53 inactivation in canine tumorigenesis may provide a valuable clinical model for assessing the efficacy and optimal therapeutic regimens of anti-cancer agents.
https://openalex.org/W2025505655,"Anionic amphiphiles, such as arachidonate, activate the superoxide-producing phagocyte NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system with human neutrophil membrane, which contains cytochrome b558 comprising gp91phox and p22phox, and three cytosolic proteins: p47phox and p67phox, each harboring two SH3 domains, and the small GTPase Rac. Here we show that, even without the amphiphiles, the oxidase is activated in vitro by a C terminally truncated p47phox, retaining the N-terminal and the two SH3 domains, and the N terminus of p67phox. When either truncated p47phox or p67phox is replaced by the respective full-length one, the activation absolutely requires the amphiphiles. The results indicate that both p47phox and p67phox are the primary targets of the amphiphiles, and that their C-terminal regions play negative regulatory roles. We also find that the truncated p47phox, but not the full-length one, can bind to p22phox, a binding required for the oxidase activation. The N-terminal SH3 domain of p47phox is responsible for the binding not only to p22phox, but also to the p47phox C terminus. Thus the SH3 domain is accessible in the active p47phox, but is normally masked in the full-length one probably via intramolecularly interacting with the C terminus.

Activation of the oxidase requires translocation of three cytosolic proteins, p47phox, p67phox, and the small GTPase Rac1/2, to the membrane where they assemble with the cytochrome.

A monoclonal antibody specific for the p47phox SH3 domains interacts with p47phox in the presence of arachidonic acid, an activator of the oxidase, but not with the resting form of p47phox (5Sumimoto H.

It is likely that the N-terminal SH3 domain of p47phox is normally inaccessible, and, upon activation, becomes unmasked to interact with p22phox (5Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T.

In the oxidase system, thus, the SH3 domain-mediated interactions are apparently regulated in contrast with the Grb2/Sos SH3 domain-mediated contacts, which are constitutive (1Pawson T.

In addition to the whole cell activation by various phagocytic or non-phagocytic stimuli, the NADPH oxidase can be activated in a cell-free system reconstituted with cytochromeb558 and the three cytosolic proteins, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac in the GTP-bound form (17Chanock S.J. el Benna J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In the system, the activation is totally dependent on the addition of such anionic amphiphile activators as arachidonic acid and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (24Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have developed an in vitro system in which the NADPH oxidase is activated without using the amphiphile activators. A mutant p47phox, allowing the N-terminal SH3 domain unmasked, is capable of both binding to p22phox and activating the oxidase without the amphiphiles when used with the N terminus of p67phox. These findings indicate the regulatory intramolecular association of the SH3 domain in p47phox, which is directly linked to the oxidase activation. The DNA fragments encoding the full-length p47phox (p47-F; amino acid residues 1–390), p47-N (1–153), p47-(SH3)2 (154–286), p47-F(W193R) (the full-length p47phox with a substitution of Trp193 for Arg), the full-length p67phox (p67-F, 1–526), p67-N (1–242), p67-SH3(C) (455–526), and p22-C (the cytoplasmic domain of p22phox, residues 132–195) were obtained as described previously (5Sumimoto H.

The DNAs for the p47-ΔC (1–286) and p47-ΔN (154–390) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a cloned cDNA encoding human p47phox or p67phox. For the mutant p47-F carrying the Trp263→ Arg substitution, namely p47-F(W263R), the mutation was introduced into p47-F by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. All the polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). All the plasmids were subjected to DNA sequencing for the confirmation of precise construction. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech). Both membrane and cytosolic fractions of human neutrophils were prepared by sequential centrifugations as described previously (5Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To prepare Rac2-enriched fractions, the cytosolic fraction was applied to a 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose CL-6B column. The flow-through fraction was applied to a DEAE Sepharose CL-6B column, and the Rac2-enriched fraction was eluted with 0.2m NaCl. The fraction contained Rac2 but was free of p47phox and p67phox as confirmed by immunodetection (11Sumimoto H. Hata K. Mizuki K. Ito T. Kage Y. Sakaki Y. Fukumaki Y. Nakamura M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22152-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The assay mixture was composed of 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 75 μm cytochrome c, 10 μm FAD, 10 μm GTPγS, 1.0 mmEGTA, and 1.0 mm NaN3. The neutrophil membrane was incubated for 2 min at room temperature with recombinant p47phox, recombinant p67phox, and the Rac2-enriched fraction in the presence or absence of 100 μm SDS. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of NADPH (1.0 mm) to the reaction mixture. The NADPH-dependent superoxide producing activity was measured by determining the rate of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable ferricytochrome c reduction at 550–540 nm with a dual-wavelength spectrophotometer (Hitachi 557), and was expressed as micromole/min/mg of membrane proteins (11Sumimoto H.

In vitro interaction between p47phox and p22phox was estimated by far Western blot as described previously (11Sumimoto H. Hata K. Mizuki K. Ito T. Kage Y. Sakaki Y. Fukumaki Y. Nakamura M.

Briefly, the GST-p22-C (1.0 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, which was incubated with 10 μg of GST-p47-F, GST-p47-ΔC, or GST-p47-(SH3)2 in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% bovine serum albumin. The filter was then probed with an anti-GST monoclonal antibody (25Tanaka S. Hattori S. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Fukui Y. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), a generous gift from Drs. Yoichi Tachibana (Nippon Zeon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and Michiyuki Matsuda (International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo, Japan), rather than a polyclonal anti-p47phox antibody, because the latter may block the interaction with p22phox. The monoclonal anti-GST antibody did not recognize the GST fusion protein transferred to nitrocellulose membrane after SDS-PAGE under the condition used (25Tanaka S. Hattori S. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Fukui Y. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Complexes were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies. The p47-F (amino acid residues 1–390), p47-ΔC (1–286), and the C-terminal region of p47phox, namely p47-C (286–390), were cloned into a modified GAL4 activation domain-fusion vector pGAD424g (12Ito T. Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to obtain pGAD-p47-F, pGAD-p47-ΔC, and pGAD-p47-C, respectively. Deletion mutants of pGAD-p47-C, namely p47-CΔP1 and p47-CΔP2, lacked amino acid residues 299–346 and 360–390, respectively (12Ito T. Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The C-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox (455–526), namely p67-SH3(C), and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of p22phox (132–195), namely p22-C, were cloned into a modified GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion vector pGBT9g (12Ito T. Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to obtain pGBT-p67-SH3(C) and pGBT-p22-C, respectively. All plasmids were subjected to DNA sequencing for the confirmation of precise construction. Pairs between the pGAD and pGBT plasmids were cotransformed into competent yeast SFY526 cells with lacZ reporter gene. After selection for Leu+ and Trp+ phenotypes, the transformants were tested for their ability to grow on plates lacking histidine. Activation of lacZ reporter was examined by β-galactosidase filter assay as described previously (12Ito T. Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The protein p47phox, an activating factor of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, comprises four portions: the N-terminal region, the N-terminal and C-terminal SH3 domains, and the C-terminal tail (Fig. 1 A). To investigate roles of the individual regions, we isolated deletion mutant proteins as GST fusions, and tested their abilities to activate the oxidase stimulated by SDS in a cell-free system reconstituted with human neutrophil membrane, the full-length p67phox, and the Rac2-enriched faction (Fig. 1 A). In the cell-free system, the wild-type full-length p47phox (p47-F) activated the NADPH oxidase in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B), and the maximal activity was obtained at the concentration of 13.0 μg/ml (about 0.2 nmol/ml). At the concentration of 0.1 nmol/ml, the p47phox lacking the C terminus (p47-ΔC) fully activated the oxidase, while neither the N terminally deleted one (p47-ΔN) nor the one without both termini (p47-(SH3)2) was capable of supporting superoxide production (Fig. 1 A). The latter two proteins were completely inactive even at 4-fold higher concentrations (data not shown). Thus the N-terminal region is essential for the oxidase activation. To clarify the role of the C-terminal SH3 domain, we introduced the substitution of Arg for Trp263, the most conserved residue in SH3 domains that directly interacts with a proline of target peptides (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 2Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 4Chen J.K. Schreiber S.L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 953-969Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mutation resulted in decreased ability to support superoxide production at submaximal (Fig.1 A) and saturated (Fig. 1 B) concentrations, indicating that the SH3 domain is not essential, but is required for the full activation. This is in contrast with that the N-terminal SH3 domain was an absolute requisite for the oxidase activation (Fig.1 A), which agrees with previous results by us and others (11Sumimoto H. Hata K. Mizuki K. Ito T. Kage Y. Sakaki Y. Fukumaki Y. Nakamura M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22152-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15de Mendez I. Homayounpour N. Leto T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Taken together, the N-terminal region and both SH3 domains are required for fully activating the oxidase. Another oxidase activating protein p67phox also harbors two SH3 domains (Fig.2), both of which seem indispensable for superoxide production in stimulated cells (7de Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the domains and the region between them are not required in a cell-free system: the N-terminal region of p67phox is sufficient for the oxidase activation (7de Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was confirmed in our cell-free activation system (Fig. 2). The region (amino acid residues 1–242) contains the Rac-binding site (26Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and the GTP-dependent interaction between p67phox and Rac seems essential for the oxidase activation (26Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 27Nishimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The activation accomplished by the C terminally deleted p47phox (p47-ΔC) and the N terminus of p67phox (p67-N) was essentially the same as that by their respective full-length proteins, in both the maximal activity (Fig. 2) and the dose dependence on the proteins (data not shown). Among the four portions of p67phox, the N-terminal region is thus sufficient for the cell-free oxidase activation, in combination with the C terminally deleted p47phox (p47-ΔC) as well as with full-length one (p47-F). In the cell-free system with p47-F and p67-F, the oxidase activation was totally dependent on the anionic amphiphile SDS (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, to our surprise, the NADPH-dependent superoxide production was observed even in the absence of the amphiphile, when both p47-ΔC and p67-N were used instead of the full-length ones (Fig.3 A). The activation required not only the truncated proteins (Fig. 3 B) but also the neutrophil membrane and Rac2, but was diminished in the presence of GDPβS, an agent keeping Rac2 in an inactive form (Fig. 3 C). These properties confirm that the superoxide production is indeed catalyzed by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. In combination with the full-length p67phox (p67-F), the C terminally deleted p47phox (p47-ΔC) failed to activate the oxidase in the absence of the amphiphile activator (Fig.4). Similarly, without the activator, combination of p47-F and p67-N did not lead to superoxide production (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the activator directly interacts with both p47phox and p67phox, and that the p47phox C terminus and the p67phox region from the first to the second SH3 domains play negative regulatory roles in the oxidase activation. To investigate the molecular event that enables p47phox to activate the oxidase, we compared the nature of the C terminally deleted p47phox (p47-ΔC) with that of the full-length one (p47-F). It is well established that, upon cell stimulation, p47phox interacts with the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of p22phox (5Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The induced interaction is mediated by the N-terminal SH3 domain of p47phox and is essential for the oxidase activation (11Sumimoto H. Hata K. Mizuki K. Ito T. Kage Y. Sakaki Y. Fukumaki Y.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An in vitrobinding assay using purified proteins revealed that p47-ΔC directly bound to p22phox as strongly as the p47phox composed solely of the SH3 domains (p47-(SH3)2) did, whereas the full-length p47phox could not (Fig.5 A). The result completely agrees with that obtained by an in vivo binding assay in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 5 B). In the C terminally deleted protein, thus, the N-terminal SH3 domain exists in a state accessible to the target p22phox. This raised a question how the SH3 domain is normally masked. We have previously shown that the SH3 domains of p47phox can interact with the C terminus of this protein, an interaction which seems to keep the SH3 domains inaccessible (5Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To determine the precise regions involved in this interaction, we performed binding experiments in the two-hybrid system. The N-terminal SH3 domain seems responsible for the interaction with the C terminus (p47-C; amino acid residues 286–390), since a mutation in this domain (Trp193 → Arg) abrogated the binding (Fig.5 C) but one in the other SH3 domain (Trp263 → Arg) did not (data not shown). The results are consistent with the observation that the N-terminal SH3 domain can interact with p47phox in vitro (15de Mendez I. Homayounpour N. Leto T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 C, the SH3 domain interacted with p47-CΔP2 that lacked the PRR (Pro361-Gln-Pro-Ala-Val-Pro-Pro-Arg-Pro369), the target for the C-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox (6Finan P. Shimizu Y.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another deletion (the deleted residues 299–346), giving p47-CΔP1, abolished the interaction with the p47phox SH3 domain, but did not affect the contact with p67phox (Fig. 5 C). Thus the intramolecular target of the p47phox N-terminal SH3 domain seems different from the site for the p67phox SH3 domain. The p67phox-binding site is likely to be exposed in the folded inactive form of p47phox, as indicated by the two hybrid interaction between the full-length p47phox and the C-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox (Fig. 5 B). Here we presented that the phagocyte NADPH oxidase is activated by the C terminally deleted p47phox (p47-ΔC) and the N terminus of p67phox (p67-N), even in the absence of in vitroactivators, anionic amphiphiles, such as arachidonic acid and SDS. The observation that the anionic amphiphile-independent activation requires both active forms of p47phox and p67phox indicates that the two proteins are the primary targets of the activators in the cell-free system. On the other hand, the action of the amphiphiles on either cytochrome b558 or Rac, if any, is not essential for the oxidase activation. The extent of the oxidase activation using both truncated proteins is comparable to that elicited by the amphiphiles: about a half of the superoxide producing activity is obtained in the present system. To our knowledge, a similar level of the activation has not been accomplished in any reported cell-free systems using purified cytosolic factors without the amphiphiles. Two recent studies have demonstrated arachidonic acid- or SDS-independent cell-free activation of the NADPH oxidase using crude neutrophil cytosol (28McPhail L.C. Qualliotine-Mann D. Waite K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7931-7935Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Park J.-W. Hoyal C.R. El Benna J. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar): one reports that phosphatidic acid fully activates the enzyme in a phosphorylation-dependent manner in a system using cellular membranes and cytosol with diacylglycerol (28McPhail L.C. Qualliotine-Mann D. Waite K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7931-7935Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the other shows that phosphorylated p47phox is capable of activating the oxidase, but to a lesser extent, when membranes are treated with cytosol and GTPγS (29Park J.-W. Hoyal C.R. El Benna J. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The present system is considered quite useful for studying in detail the activation mechanisms of the individual cytosolic proteins. In the absence of the amphiphiles, the oxidase activation is dependent on the state of p47phox, when p67-N (an active form of p67phox) is used with the GTP-bound Rac2. Under the conditions, the oxidase is activated by the addition of the active p47phox (p47-ΔC), but not the full-length one (Fig. 4). Similarly, with p47-ΔC, the state of p67phox is the determinant. When both p47-ΔC and p67-N are present, the activation totally depends on the state of Rac: little superoxide production was observed with Rac2 in the GDP-bound inactive form (Fig. 3 C). We also studied here the mechanism for activating p47phox. The active p47phox (p47-ΔC) interacted with p22phox bothin vivo and in vitro, while the full-length one in the resting state did not (Fig. 5). This interaction is mediated via binding of the p47phox N-terminal SH3 domain to the PRR of p22phox (11Sumimoto H. Hata K. Mizuki K. Ito T. Kage Y. Sakaki Y. Fukumaki Y. Nakamura M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22152-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15de Mendez I. Homayounpour N. Leto T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), an interaction which is indispensable for the oxidase activation (11Sumimoto H. Hata K. Mizuki K. Ito T. Kage Y. Sakaki Y. Fukumaki Y. Nakamura M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22152-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15de Mendez I. Homayounpour N. Leto T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus the conformational change of p47phox that is induced by the amphiphiles appears to culminate in unmasking of the N-terminal SH3 domain, leading to the access to p22phox. In the resting state, this domain is masked probably by interacting with a C-terminal region of p47phox. The region required for this interaction is different from the PRR, the target for the C-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox. This implies that the intramolecular interaction in p47phox and its intermolecular binding to p67phox are not mutually exclusive, i.e.both interactions can occur at the same time. Indeed the full-length p47phox, in which the N-terminal SH3 domain is masked, can bind to the p67phox SH3 domain (Fig. 5 B). The intramolecular interaction appears to require the target-binding surface of the p47phox SH3 domain, since a mutation of the surface (W193R) abrogates the binding (Fig. 5 C). On the other hand, the target region in p47phox does not contain a typical PRR. In this context, it should be noted that the SH3 domain of the tyrosine kinase Src interacts intramolecularly, via its target-binding surface, with the region lacking a proline-rich sequence (30Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Taken together, the N-terminal SH3 domain of p47phox likely undergoes an intramolecular interaction with the C-terminal region, which could restrict access of the domain to its target (Fig.6). The anionic amphiphile activators seem to disrupt the intramolecular interaction in p47phox, thereby liberating the SH3 domain to engage p22phox. When cells are stimulated, arachidonic acid released from the membrane may promote the conformational change of p47phox, as well as p67phox, leading to the superoxide production. It is known that, during activation, p47phox becomes phosphorylated at multiple sites in the C-terminal region (31el Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), accompanied by its translocation to the membrane, and it has recently been reported that the phosphorylated p47phox is active in a cell-free activation system (29Park J.-W. Hoyal C.R. El Benna J. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Future studies should test whether the phosphorylation converts the intramolecular interaction of the p47phox SH3 domain to the intermolecular one with p22phox, thereby activating the oxidase. In addition, the present finding that the truncated versions of p47phox and p67phox are both active, also raises a possibility that these proteins might be proteolytically activated in stimulated cells. Some protease inhibitors are shown to inhibit the superoxide production by phagocytes (32Cross A.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1990; 8: 71-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This study unequivocally shows that the amphiphile activators directly interact not only with p47phox but also with p67phox, the latter interaction which is previously suggested (33Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30326-30329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The precise event evoked in p67phox, however, is presently unknown. The oxidase activation is repressed by the p67phox region containing both SH3 domains. Pinpointing the responsible region will help our understanding of the mechanism, and such studies are now in progress in our laboratory. On the basis of the studies on the NADPH oxidase system, we have previously proposed (5Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and advanced here the “masking-unmasking” model for a regulatory mechanism of SH3 domain-mediated interactions: an SH3 domain, that is normally masked via its intramolecular interaction, becomes exposed to intermolecularly interact with the target. It should be strengthened that, in the oxidase system, the induced intermolecular interaction is specific and required for the activation both in vivo and in vitro (5Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar): p22phox is the bona fide target for the N-terminal SH3 domain of p47phox. A similar molecular event has recently been postulated in the T-cell specific tyrosine kinase Itk, a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinase, that is required for signaling via the T-cell antigen receptor (35Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng G. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 375: 93-97Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The PRR adjacent to the SH3 domain of Itk interacts with the domain intramolecularly. Formation of this complex prevents the SH3 domain and the PRR from interacting with their respective putative substrates, Sam68 and Grb2 (35Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng G. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 375: 93-97Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In p120 Ras-GAP (GTPase-activating protein), containing an SH3 domain flanked by two SH2 domains, it undergoes a conformational change that leads to increased accessibility of the target binding surface of its SH3 domain, when two closely linked phosphotyrosine-containing peptides bind simultaneously to the two SH2 domains (36Hu K.-Q. Settleman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent structural studies have revealed that the SH3 domain of the tyrosine kinases Src and Hck interacts intramolecularly not only with the linker region between the SH2 and kinase domains, but also simultaneously with the kinase domain, resulting in inhibition of the enzymatic activity (30Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 37Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Thus such regulatory intramolecular association of SH3 domains, as occurred in p47phox, is currently considered to be much more general than previously expected (38Nguyen J.T. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This type of the regulation would be found in a variety of signaling proteins that carry both an SH3 domain and a PRR, such as the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (39Liu X. Marengere L.E. Koch C.A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5225-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and the yeast protein Bem1p (40Chenevert J. Corrado K. Bender A. Pringle J. Herskowitz I.

https://openalex.org/W2331544440,"The RB and p16INK4A tumor suppressor genes function in the same pathway of cell cycle control. Previous evidence indicates that the p16INK4A gene is transcriptionally repressed by the RB gene product, pRB. In this study using human ovarian cancer cell lines, we found that RB protein and mRNA were expressed at higher levels in cell lines lacking p16 than in those with normal p16. Since this suggests a potential role of p16 in regulating the cellular level of pRB, we studied the effect of wild-type p16INK4A on expression of the RB gene. Introduction of p16INK4A, carried by an adenovirus vector, into p16-negative cell lines dramatically decreased expression of RB protein and mRNA. Nuclei run-off assays demonstrated that p16 expression induced transcriptional downregulation of the RB gene. These results indicate that expression of RB is inversely regulated by p16. The findings reveal a new dimension of pRB-p16 interaction and should have implications for p16INK4A-mediated gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2049510024,"We investigated the expression of butyrophilin in eukaryotic cells with a view to determining the number of mRNA species, the incorporation of the peptide chain into microsomes, and the topology of the processed protein in biological membranes.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14481-14486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent comparisons with more recently cloned cDNAs have established that BTN is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (5Gardinier M.V. Amiguet P. Linington C. Matthieu J.-M. J. Neurosci.

However, the assumption that BTN behaves as an integral protein in mammary epithelial cells has been confounded by several observations. There are persistent reports of “soluble” forms of BTN in postmicrosomal supernatant fractions of lactating mammary tissue. BTN has been identified by immunoblotting techniques associated with cytoplasmic lipid droplets (17Deeney J.T. Valivullah H.M. Dapper C.H. Dylewski D.P. Keenan T.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 16-26PubMed Google Scholar), which are the presumed precursors of secreted milk-fat globules (17Deeney J.T. Valivullah H.M. Dapper C.H. Dylewski D.P. Keenan T.W. Eur. J.

Ankrapp D.P. Keenan T.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 2In preliminary experiments we also apparently identified a soluble form of BTN in postmicrosomal supernatants by immunoblotting techniques (20Banghart L.R. Jack L.J.W. Mather I.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 208aGoogle Scholar). These results could not be repeated when Tween 20 was omitted from the washing buffers used for immunoblotting, and subsequently when a different batch of peroxidase-conjugated second antibody was used to detect bound antibody on the blots, either in the presence or absence of Tween 20. This component may have been the heavy chain of endogenous immunoglobulins identified as a nonspecific band on blots of immunoprecipitates developed with chemiluminescence reagents by other workers (21Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Sofer L. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14021-14026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BTN is secreted in association with the MFGM in several forms which include not only the isoelectric variants expected for a heterogeneous N-linked glycoprotein (22Heid H.W. Winter S. Bruder G. Keenan T.W. Jarasch E.-D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 728: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Sato T. Takio K. Kobata A. Greenwalt D.E. Furukawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but also smaller forms (22Heid H.W. Winter S. Bruder G. Keenan T.W. Jarasch E.-D. Biochim. Biophys.

Protoplasma. 1990; 159: 168-178Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) which could be the soluble products of alternatively spliced mRNAs lacking the membrane anchor. Morphological analysis of the structure of MFGM has also yielded ambiguous results. In previous immunocytochemical studies, antibodies prepared against purified bovine or guinea pig BTN predominantly decorate the protein coat (24Freudenstein C. Keenan T.W. Eigel W.N. Sasaki M. Stadler J. Franke W.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 118: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Wooding F.B.P. Kemp P. Cell Tissue Res. 1975; 165: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) on the cytoplasmic face of the MFGM (13Franke W.W. Heid H.W. Grund C. Winter S. Freudenstein C. Schmid E. Jarasch E.-D. Keenan T.W. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Mather I.H. Neville M.C. Daniel C.W. The Mammary Gland, Development, Regulation and Function. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987: 217-267Google Scholar), suggesting that BTN is largely located there possibly as a “peripheral” cytoskeletal-like component (13Franke W.W. Heid H.W. Grund C. Winter S. Freudenstein C. Schmid E. Jarasch E.-D. Keenan T.W. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, selective removal of the lipid bilayer from fat globules by physical agitation leaves a substantial amount of BTN associated with the droplet surface in coat structures (17Deeney J.T. Valivullah H.M. Dapper C.H. Dylewski D.P. Keenan T.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 16-26PubMed Google Scholar), which is not consistent with the predicted integral properties of BTN (1Jack L.J.W. Mather I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14481-14486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data parallel the results of freeze-fracture electron microscopy from several laboratories which show that the fracture faces of MFGM are depleted of the intramembranous particles typically associated with integral proteins (27Peixoto de Menezes A. Pinto da Silva P. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 76: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Zerban H. Franke W.W. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1978; 2: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Pinto da Silva P. Peixoto de Menezes A. Mather I.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 125: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The situation has been further complicated by the discovery of at least six BTN-like genes in the major histocompatibility complex which are widely expressed in many tissues, possibly including the mammary gland (11Ruddy D.A. Kronmal G.S. Lee V.K. Mintier G.A. Quintana L. Domingo Jr., R. Meyer N.C. Irrinki A. McClelland E.E. Fullan A. Mapa F.A. Moore T. Thomas W. Loeb D.B. Harmon C. Tsuchihashi Z. Wolff R.K. Schatzman R.C. Feder J.N. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 441-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Tazi-Ahnini R. Henry J. Offer C. Bouissou-Bouchouata C. Mather I.H. Pontarotti P. Immunogenetics. 1997; 47: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Some of these BTN-like proteins (with amino acid identities to BTN approaching 50%) appear to be synthesized from alternatively spliced mRNAs (11Ruddy D.A. Kronmal G.S. Lee V.K. Mintier G.A. Quintana L. Domingo Jr., R. Meyer N.C. Irrinki A. McClelland E.E. Fullan A. Mapa F.A. Moore T. Thomas W. Loeb D.B. Harmon C. Tsuchihashi Z. Wolff R.K. Schatzman R.C. Feder J.N. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 441-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that earlier studies employing polyclonal antibody to purified BTN have mistakenly identified other BTN-like proteins from this gene family in mammary tissue. To resolve these issues, we have reinvestigated the expression of BTN in mammary cells using a combination of immunochemical and molecular approaches with epitope-specific antibodies. The results indicate that BTN is synthesized as an integral membrane protein from a single size class of mRNA and retains a type I orientation following secretion in milk-fat droplets. Trypsin type XIII and soybean trypsin inhibitor type 1-S were purchased from Sigma. Moloney murine leukemia virus and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, Taq DNA polymerase, and in vitro protein translation kits were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Neuraminidase isolated from Arthrobacter ureafaciens was from Boehringer Mannheim. The pCRII and pBlueBacII vectors were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and Bluescript vectors were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Materials for insect cell culture were from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). Materials for electrophoresis and immunoblotting including goat anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase were from Bio-Rad. Other antibodies were from ICN Biochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Primers were custom ordered from either Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) or Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Radionucleotides were from either DuPont (Boston, MA) or Amersham Corp. (Arlington Heights, IL). RIBI was purchased from Immunochem. Research Inc. (Hamilton, MT). Washed fat globules for topological studies were prepared from fresh uncooled milk (pooled from three cows) by a method designed to limit physical damage to the outer surface of the droplets (30Patton S. Huston G.E. Lipids. 1986; 21: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Bovine MFGM was prepared as described (31Mather I.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 514: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Soluble (whey) fractions of bovine milk were obtained by centrifuging 200 ml of the pooled skim milk from three cows at 100,000 × gav for 2 h at 4 °C. The residual layer of fat was removed by aspiration and the opalescent subnatant carefully separated from the white pellet of casein. Cell fractions were prepared from mammary glands obtained from lactating cows at slaughter using either a Brinkman PT 10/35 homogenizer (Westbury, NY) or a Sorvall Omnimixer, essentially as described (25Neira L.M. Mather I.H. Protoplasma. 1990; 159: 168-178Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Antipeptide antibodies were prepared with peptides synthesized by Dr. Thomas Kempe (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland, College Park). For the exo-1 and cyto-1 antibodies (Fig. 1), antigen was treated with immunogen enhancer (CYTImmune Sciences, Inc., College Park, MD) (32Paciotti G.F. Baron D. Licinio J. Tamarkin L. Wong M.-L. Gold P.W. Altemus M.E. Rubinow D. Prog. Neuroendocrinimmunol. 1992; 5: 21-30Google Scholar) and mixed 1:1 (v/v) with either RIBI or Freund's complete adjuvant. Antigen/adjuvant mixtures were injected subcutaneously into multiple sites on the back of New Zealand White rabbits. For the exo-2 and cyto-2 antibodies (Fig. 1), antigen was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (33Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant, and injected into the thigh lymph nodes and subcutaneously into the back of the neck. Subsequent injections of antigen mixed with either Freund's incomplete adjuvant or Tris-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4) were administered in the subscapulum, the thigh muscles, and the ear vein. Antibody to bovine BTN was prepared by using antigen purified from MFGM by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified protein was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (33Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) by standard procedures. With the exception of exo-1, antibody was purified by adsorption to, and elution from, the respective antigen (peptide or protein) covalently coupled to Sepharose-4B, as described by Neira and Mather (25Neira L.M. Mather I.H. Protoplasma. 1990; 159: 168-178Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Exo-1 serum was used without purification. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and ancillary staining techniques were as described (25Neira L.M. Mather I.H. Protoplasma. 1990; 159: 168-178Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar, 35O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblots, proteins separated by one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were transferred to nitrocellulose (36Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar) and the blots developed according to the procedures of Bio-Rad. Antibody-peroxidase conjugates were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). In some immunoblots Tween 20 was omitted from the washing buffers. The full-length cDNA clone BT1 (1Jack L.J.W. Mather I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14481-14486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encoding bovine BTN was inserted into Bluescript and sense mRNA was synthesized as described by Zerial et al. (37Zerial M. Melancon P. Schneider C. Garoff H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The synthesized mRNA was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine (>1,000 Ci/mmol) (30 μCi), a mixture of 19 unlabeled amino acids (without methionine) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate, using the Promegain vitro translation kit. In some experiments, microsomal membranes from dog pancreas, pretreated with 50 mm EGTA (38Melancon P. Garoff H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were added at a final concentration of 4.0 A280 nm units/ml. Mixtures were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were soaked in ENHANCE (Amersham), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Translation mixtures prepared as described above, either in the presence or absence of microsomal membranes, were treated with proteinase K at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 1 h on ice. In some experiments, the membranes were permeabilized by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 12.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and further incubation for 5 min at 0 °C. Translation mixtures (25 μl) prepared in the presence of microsomal membranes were incubated overnight in an end-over-end stirrer with 20 μl of antipeptide antibody or control immunoglobulin at 4 °C. The microsomes were washed twice with 200-μl aliquots of Tris-buffered saline, recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g in a Sorvall RCM120 mini-ultracentrifuge at 4 °C, and resuspended in 50 μl of Tris-buffered saline. Goat anti-rabbit IgG was added at a final dilution of 1:50 and a final volume of 100 μl in Tris-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitated membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 1,000 × g after incubating overnight at 4 °C in an end-over-end stirrer. The sequence of DNA encompassing nucleotides 43 through 1655 of clone BT1 (1Jack L.J.W. Mather I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14481-14486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified using the PCR, and primer pairs 5′-CCCAGAAAGCTAGCAGATGGCAGTCT-3′ and 5′-TGAGCTGGAGTAGATCTTAAGGCACC-3′ to prepare a 1.6-kilobase fragment encoding the entire open reading frame of BTN with NheI and BglII restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. This fragment of DNA, after cloning into the pCRII vector, was directionally subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac II to obtain plasmid pBTBacII. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells were cultured in Hink's TNM-FH-medium (39Hink W.F. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1991; 27A: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and cells were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B in either Falconware tissue culture flasks at 28 °C or spinner flasks (Bellco) at room temperature. Cells grown in spinner flasks contained 0.1% Pluronic F-68 in addition to the above supplemented medium. A recombinant baculovirus, with the BTN cDNA under the control of the polyhedrin promoter, was generated by homologous recombination as described (40O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 Sf9 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of pBTBacII DNA and 1 μg of wild-type Autographa californicanuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA. Recombinant virus was isolated by blue/white selection (40O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar) and plaque purified three times. The presence of the BTN cDNA was confirmed by PCR and the recombinant virus designated vBT. Sf9 cells were grown on microscope coverslips in Hink's medium (39Hink W.F. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1991; 27A: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Individual wells of 12-well tissue culture plates were seeded with 0.9 × 106 Sf9 cells in 2 ml of medium. After 24 h growth at room temperature, the cells were infected with 1.33 × 107 plaque-forming units of vBT. Twenty-four hours postinfection, intact cells on coverslips were washed twice for 5 min each time in Hink's medium containing 0.1% (w/v) NaN3 at 30 °C and then incubated with a 1–50-fold dilution of affinity-purified antipeptide antibody in the same medium for 30 min at room temperature in a humidity chamber. Cells were washed three times with Hink's/NaN3 medium, for 5 min each time at room temperature, and then fixed for 15 min in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (140 mm NaCl in 10 mm KH2PO4/KOH buffer, pH 7.4), containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mmMgCl2. Reactive aldehyde groups were blocked by incubating the fixed cells for 10 min in NH4Cl and the coverslips washed three times, for 5 min each time in PBS. The cells were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein at a dilution of 1–50-fold in PBS for 30 min, washed three times in PBS, rinsed in distilled water, and mounted in elvanol. To permeabilize cells, coverslips were rinsed three times for 1 min each time in PBS and then incubated with 0.05% (w/v) saponin in PBS for 5 min at 30 °C. The cells were fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% (w/v) saponin, 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mmMgCl2 for 5 min, and then for a further 10 min in the absence of saponin. After a 10-min incubation with NH4Cl, the cells were washed three times for 5 min each time in PBS and then labeled with affinity-purified antipeptide antibody in PBS and antibody/fluorescein conjugates in PBS, essentially as described above. Total RNA was prepared from lactating bovine mammary tissue obtained at slaughter from the USDA Beltsville abattoir (Beltsville, MD) or from pooled mammary tissue from Balb/c mice (3 mice from day 1, or 3 mice from day 14 of lactation). The RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by incubation with either Moloney murine leukemia virus or avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamers at 37 or 42 °C, respectively, for 15 min, following the protocol described in the Perkin-Elmer RT-PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Branchburg, NJ). Specific regions of the synthesized cDNA, indicated by Arabic numbers in Fig. 2, were amplified by the PCR usingTaq DNA polymerase and the primer pairs listed in the legend to Fig. 2. The amplified products obtained with primer pairs 5 (bovine) and 10 (mouse) were sequenced to confirm identity (see also Ref.41Ogg S.L. Komaragiri M.V.S. Mather I.H. Mammal. Genome. 1996; 7: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Washed cream and MFGM samples were suspended in PBS in 0.5-ml aliquots in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes with or without trypsin. Each mixture contained 1.0 mg of protein and 0–20 μg of trypsin. Samples were incubated at 35 °C for 30 min and proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 250 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor in 100 μl of PBS on ice. The cream and MFGM samples were washed once with PBS containing trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml). Fat globules were separated at 5 °C by centrifuging in a bench-top Eppendorf microcentrifuge set at maximum speed for 5 min. The bottom of the tube was then cut with a razor blade and the subnatant carefully removed from the packed cream layer with a micropipette. Cream was quantitatively recovered from the tube by centrifuging the contents into a second 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube contained within a 15-ml centrifuge tube. MFGM was recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Sorvall RCM120 mini-ultracentrifuge. Cream and MFGM samples were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting by heating in SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 3 min. Protein was assayed, either with the bicinchoninic acid reagent (42Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18643) Google Scholar), or by the method of Lowry et al. (43Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Soluble whey fractions from milk were dialyzed against 62.5 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 6.8, overnight to remove lactose before protein analysis. We first investigated the expression of BTN in mammary cells by RT-PCR to establish whether BTN is synthesized from a single sized mRNA or from alternatively spliced mRNAs. Total RNA from the mammary tissue of one lactating cow and two samples of pooled RNA each from three Balb/c mice were reverse-transcribed into cDNA and amplified using the PCR. Primer pairs for the PCR were selected to amplify BTN cDNA (mRNA) across all exon/intron boundaries (41Ogg S.L. Komaragiri M.V.S. Mather I.H. Mammal. Genome. 1996; 7: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,44Davey H.W. Ogg S.L. Husaini Y. Snell R.G. Korobko I.V. Mather I.H. Wilkins R.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) paying special attention to the exon encoding the membrane anchor (exon 4). In every case and in both species, single major amplified products were obtained of the sizes predicted from the published cDNAs (1Jack L.J.W. Mather I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14481-14486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ishii T. Aoki N. Noda A. Adachi T. Nakamura R. Matsuda T. Biochim. Biophys.

Genome. 1996; 7: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), indicating that BTN is synthesized from one major size class of mRNA as originally suggested from Northern analysis of bovine RNA (1Jack L.J.W. Mather I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14481-14486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). To study the distribution and orientation of BTN in cells and tissues, four antipeptide antibodies were produced, two specific for sequences in the N-terminal, exoplasmic domain (exo-1 and exo-2), and two to sequences in the C-terminal, cytoplasmic domain (cyto-1 and cyto-2) (Fig. 1). The antipeptide antibodies were determined to be monospecific by blotting to MFGM proteins that had been separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. All four antibodies bound to the major band of BTN protein of Mr 66,000 on the blots and binding was progressively inhibited by adding increasing amounts of the respective peptide (data not shown). No cross-reactive proteins were detected in microsomal membrane and postmicrosomal supernatant fractions from bovine liver, lung, or heart, with either the exo-2 or cyto-2 antibodies. Similar results were obtained with an affinity purified preparation of r"
https://openalex.org/W2313254772,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) observed at polymorphic loci on both arms of chromosome 10 in many human gliomas suggests the presence of multiple tumor suppressor genes on this chromosome. Recently, the PTEN/MMAC1 gene on 10q23 was isolated as one of these putative glioma suppressors. To determine the subchromosomal localization of others, we analysed 79 gliomas for LOH using 30 polymorphic microsatellite markers on the short arm and 10 markers on the long arm of chromosome 10. Twenty tumors showed LOH at all the loci examined, while 17 others showed LOH at loci on a portion of chromosome 10. Deletion mapping of the latters demonstrated that two distinct regions, encompassing genetic distances of 5.6 cM on 10p15 and 5.5 cM on 10p14, were lost frequently. Introduction of chromosomal fragments 10p14 – p15, which included the entire region on 10p15 and a portion of that on 10p14 assigned by deletion mapping, into the human glioblastoma cell line T98G through microcell-mediated chromosome transfer markedly suppressed colony forming ability in soft agar compared with parental T98G cells. The combined results of structural and functional analyses strongly suggest that aberrations of the tumor suppressor gene(s) within chromosomal region 10p14 – p15 are involved in development of human gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2324852616,"In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the neoplastic (BCR-ABL+) progenitor cells are characterized by an increased proliferative activity. Whether these cells are also resistant to apoptosis and if so, under what conditions remains controversial. We now show that highly purified populations of very primitive neoplastic progenitor cells obtained directly from CML patients survive and proliferate in vitro for several weeks in the absence of any added growth factors (except insulin). In contrast, purified primary normal progenitors maintained under the same conditions die rapidly. Nevertheless, both primary CML cells and BCR-ABL+ BAF3 cells show the same dose-dependent sensitivity to TNF-alpha or ceramide-induced apoptosis as their respective normal counterparts. In fact, time course studies demonstrated an even faster onset of apoptosis in ceramide-treated BCR-ABL+ BAF3 cells as compared to normal controls. BCR-ABL+ cells treated with ceramide also showed a rapid and sequential increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p210(BCR-ABL), p46-56SHC and p120Cbl. These findings suggest growth factor deprivation and treatment with TNF-alpha or ceramide trigger different initial events both of which can lead to apoptosis in factor-dependent hematopoietic cells. However, in the first case, activation of apoptosis is blocked by the basal activity of p210(BCR-ABL), whereas in the second, the presence of p210(BCR-ABL) appears to accelerate the onset of apoptosis by a mechanism that may involve an activation of its kinase function."
https://openalex.org/W2315960798,"The human Unp gene at 3p21.3 has sequence similarity to ubiquitin proteases and has been suggested to play a role in carcinogenesis of the lung (Gray et al., 1995). To investigate this possibility, we isolated cDNAs from several human tissue libraries and found evidence for two major isoforms, encoding proteins predicted to either contain an internal 47 amino acid segment or not. Both are functional in deubiquitination assays, and mutation of a critical conserved cysteine residue to alanine abolished activity. Unp specifies two closely-migrating transcripts whose relative abundance varies among human adult tissues. Antibodies specific to UNP confirm the presence of at least two endogenous protein isoforms of approximately 105-110 kDa in cell lysates, as predicted from the cDNA sequences. Cellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry revealed UNP expression localized primarily in the cytoplasm. When we examined a panel of lung-derived cell lines for both UNP mRNA and protein expression, we found reduced levels of UNP protein in all four small cell lung carcinoma cell lines tested. These findings directly contradict and offer alternative interpretations to a number of previously published observations on Unp."
https://openalex.org/W2316473607,"We have used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of tandem repeats to study the pattern of allelic loss on chromosome X11.2-q12 in borderline and invasive epithelial ovarian tumors. Using eight microsatellite markers spanning Xq11.2-q12, 41 borderline and 65 invasive ovarian tumors, together with their corresponding normal tissues, were analysed. The highest percentage of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed at the DXS1194 locus in borderline tumors (four of 16 informative cases, 25%) and at the androgen receptor (AR) locus in invasive epithelial ovarian tumors (18 of 47 informative cases, 38%). X chromosome activation studies performed in cases with LOH at the AR locus showed that the allelic loss at the AR locus is not confined to the inactive allele. A one centimorgan region including the AR locus and flanked by the primers DXS1161 and PGK1P1 was identified as the smallest common loss region in both borderline and invasive epithelial ovarian tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2091366956,"A metabolic pathway responsible for the biosynthesis and utilization of mannitol is present in the seven species of Eimeria that infect chickens, but is not in the avian host. Mannitol-1-phosphatase (M1Pase), a key enzyme for mannitol biosynthesis, is a highly substrate-specific phosphatase and, accordingly, represents an attractive chemotherapeutic target. Amino acid sequence of tryptic peptides obtained from biochemically purifiedEimeria tenella M1Pase was used to synthesize degenerate oligonucleotide hybridization probes. Using these reagents, a partial genomic clone and full-length cDNA clones have been isolated and characterized. The deduced amino acid sequence of E. tenella M1Pase shows limited overall homology to members of the phosphohistidine family of phosphatases. This limited homology to other histidine phosphatases does, however, include several conserved residues that have been shown to be essential for their catalytic activity. Kinetic parameters of recombinant M1Pase expressed in bacteria are essentially identical to those of the biochemically purified preparation from E. tenella. Moreover, recombinant M1Pase is subject to active site-directed, hydroxylamine-reversible inhibition by the histidine-selective acylating reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate. These results indicate the presence of an essential histidine residue(s) at the M1Pase active site, as predicted for a histidine phosphatase.

The deduced amino acid sequence of E. tenella M1Pase shows limited overall homology to members of the phosphohistidine family of phosphatases. This limited homology to other histidine phosphatases does, however, include several conserved residues that have been shown to be essential for their catalytic activity. Kinetic parameters of recombinant M1Pase expressed in bacteria are essentially identical to those of the biochemically purified preparation from E. tenella. Moreover, recombinant M1Pase is subject to active site-directed, hydroxylamine-reversible inhibition by the histidine-selective acylating reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate. These results indicate the presence of an essential histidine residue(s) at the M1Pase active site, as predicted for a histidine phosphatase. Protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria are the causative agents of the intestinal disease known as coccidiosis. Coccidiosis occurs in a large number of domesticated and wild animals, but of major economic importance is the impact that Eimeriaspp. have on the poultry industry. During acute infections, these parasites cause significant morbidity and mortality, resulting in a reduction in the productivity of broiler chickens. The life cycle of Eimeria is well characterized (1Levine N.D. Long P.L. The Biology of Coccidia. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1982: 1-30Google Scholar). Mature sporulated oocysts, the vegetative stage of the parasite, are ingested by the chicken. Infective sporozoites are released from oocysts in the intestine and rapidly invade epithelial cells lining the gut with a tropism that is unique for each species. Once intracellular, sporozoites expand in number and develop into merozoites in a process known as schizogony. Merozoites then proceed through a second round of asexual replication termed merogony, which ultimately causes much of the intestinal pathology characteristic of the disease. Upon re-infecting epithelial cells, second generation merozoites develop to form both macrogametes and microgametes. Microgametes travel to and fertilize macrogametes within neighboring cells. The resulting zygote develops intracellularly into an unsporulated oocyst, which is released from the debilitated host cell and is shed in the feces. Unsporulated oocysts must then mature, or sporulate, outside of the animal host to initiate the next round of infection. Unsporulated oocysts are entirely dependent upon endogenous sources of energy to remain viable and to sporulate efficiently. The source of this energy in Eimeria is the alcohol sugar mannitol (2Schmatz D.M. Arison B.H. Dashkevicz M.P. Turner M.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mannitol represents as much as 25% of the total dry weight of an unsporulated Eimeria tenella oocyst. During sporulation, there is greater than a 90% reduction in the level of this polyol.In vivo studies using inhibitors of mannitol biosynthesis have shown that this storage carbohydrate is essential for parasite viability. 1J. Allocco and H. Profous-Juchelka, unpublished data. The metabolic pathway that is responsible for the biosynthesis and utilization of mannitol in E. tenella, the mannitol cycle, has been characterized (3Schmatz D. Baginsky W.F. Turner M.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 32: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Schmatz D.M. Parasitol. Today. 1989; 5: 205-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All four mannitol cycle enzymes, namely mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase, mannitol-1-phosphatase (M1Pase), 2The abbreviations used are: M1Pase, mannitol-1-phosphatase; kb, kilobase(s); nt, nucleotide(s); USO, unsporulated oocysts; ORF, open reading frame; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; LC-ESI-MS, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PaseNR, recombinant expressed nonfusion M1Pase; PaseNRH, recombinant expressed COOH-terminal hexahistidine-tagged M1Pase; PNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate. mannitol dehydrogenase, and hexokinase, are present in unsporulated and sporulated oocysts of E. tenella. Aside from protozoan parasites of the subphylum Apicomplexa, the mannitol cycle has only been described in certain fungi (5Hult K. Gatenbeck S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Higher eukaryotic hosts do not synthesize or catabolize mannitol. It is this potential for selective intervention that initiated the development of a series of biochemical screens for mannitol cycle inhibitors. In this regard, E. tenella M1Pase has been purified to homogeneity. 3R. W. Myers, M. N. Feiglin, J. J. Allocco, and D. M. Schmatz, manuscript in preparation. The sequence of several tryptic peptides from this purified enzyme has allowed us to isolate and characterize genomic and cDNA clones that code for E. tenella M1Pase. This report represents the first molecular description of a mannitol-1-phosphatase from any organism. Each of the tryptic peptide sequences can be found in the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA clone. We have functionally expressed recombinant M1Pase in bacteria both as a nonfusion protein and with six histidine residues at the COOH-terminal end. The recombinant enzymes are enzymatically indistinguishable from each other and, in turn, are very similar to native M1Pase purified from E. tenella unsporulated oocysts. Using functional recombinant enzyme, we provide data which indicate that E. tenella M1Pase is a new member of the phosphohistidine phosphotransferase family of phosphatases. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems model 384 DNA synthesizer and purified according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Oligonucleotides were radioactively end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) using polynucleotide kinase from Boehringer Mannheim. Enzymes used for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were purchased from Perkin-Elmer and Life Technologies, Inc. PCR products were gel-purified using Qiaex II (Qiagen, Inc.) and subcloned directly into the TA-cloning vector pGEM-T (Promega). Gel purified DNA fragments to be used as hybridization probes were random-primer labeled (7Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar, 8Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5193) Google Scholar) with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). Unless otherwise stated, restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and New England Biolabs. Electrocompetent bacterial cells were from Life Technologies, Inc. Precast polyacrylamide gels and protein molecular weight markers were purchased from Novex. The generation and characterization of polyclonal antisera prepared in rabbits against native E. tenella M1Pase is described elsewhere.3 Other standard DNA manipulations were carried out as described (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The following three degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized based upon M1Pase tryptic peptide sequences: from peptide 21, 5′-TG GTT GTT NGC GTA GTC NAC YTG NCC YTG GAA-3′; from peptide 36, 5′-GTT GTC CCA YTC NCC GAA NGC CAT YTC-3′; from peptide 38, 5′-GTA GTT NCC GTC GAA NCC NAG GAA-3′. Only the oligonucleotide derived from peptide 36 (36-a) specifically hybridized to restriction enzyme digested E. tenella genomic DNA. Genomic DNA was preparatively digested with ApaI and resolved by gel electrophoresis, and the gel slice corresponding to the 3.5-kb hybridization signal was selected. Genomic DNA in this gel slice was extracted, ligated into ApaI-digested pBluescript KS (Stratagene), and used to transform electrocompetent DH10B bacteria. This subgenomic plasmid library was screened by colony lift hybridization using end-labeled oligonucleotide 36-a. Total RNA was prepared from unsporulated oocysts (USO) of E. tenella(10Profous-Juchelka H. Liberator P. Turner M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 30: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Poly(A) RNA was twice selected using oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography and used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis with SuperScript RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT) or random hexamer primers. Following second strand cDNA synthesis (11Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst .). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar) and EcoRI adapter ligation, double-stranded cDNA was size fractionated by column chromatography using Sephacryl S-500 HR and then ligated into the phage vector λ ZAP II (Stratagene). Ligation reaction products were then packaged using Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A total of 1.25 × 106 recombinant phage were screened using the 190-nt Pase 1–2 PCR product prepared using genomic clone 6L-11 as template. Several plaque-pure positive clones were isolated from each library and subcloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene) byin vivo excision. Phagemid clones were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and partial nucleotide sequence analysis. Automated DNA sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 373 instrument with the Prism FS cycle sequencing kit. Nucleotide sequence analysis was carried out with the University of Wisconson Genetics Computer Group Software Package (12Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) and the TFASTA protein homology program (13Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar). Constructs were made for expression in bacteria of both a nonfusion M1Pase (PaseNR) and a M1Pase fusion protein with six histidine residues at the COOH-terminal end (PaseNRH). Inserts were prepared by PCR using cDNA clone T2a15 as template. Oligonucleotide primer Pase-N2F (5′-GG GCC ATG GCA GAG ACT GAG TGG-3′), which includes the initiator methionine, was used for the 5′ end of both constructs. The 3′-PCR primers were 5′-GGC CAA GCT TAG GGT TTA GCG TTT GGG-3′ and 5′-GGC CAA GCT TAG TGA TGG TGA TGG TGA TGG GGT TTA GCG TTT GGG-3′, for PaseNR and PaseNRH, respectively. Both of these span the translation termination codon depicted in bold type. PCR reaction products were gel-purified, sequentially digested with NcoI and HindIII, directionally cloned as 5′-NcoI/3′-HindIII fragments into the bacterial expression vector pQE60 (Qiagen, Inc.), and used to transform electrocompetent bacteria. Nucleotide sequence of the respective constructs was determined to verify the fidelity of the amplification reaction. Plasmids were then transformed into the bacterial host M15pREP4 for expression. Bacteria harboring recombinant plasmid were grown in 2 × YT medium under carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) pressure at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm. Protein expression was induced with the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 3 h, the bacteria were collected by centrifugation and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. For most applications, the cells were sonicated on ice (5 × 60 s) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl). Protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad protein assay, microassay protocol with bovine serum albumin as standard) and samples were resolved by denaturing SDS-PAGE on a linear 4–20% (w/v) gradient gel. Fractionated denatured proteins were either stained or electroblotted to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. In some cases, nondenaturing PAGE was performed as described previously and gels were processed for in situ M1Pase activity.3 Native PAGE gels were also electroblotted to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis, but in transfer buffer without methanol. Following sonication of the bacterial pellet containing histidine-tagged M1Pase, the suspension was centrifuged (15 min, 40,000 × g). The vast majority of immunopositive M1Pase remained in the supernatant, and this was injected onto a HiTrap chelating Sepharose column (1 ml, nickel form). The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer A at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and fractions (1.0 ml) were collected immediately. The column was eluted using a 0–200 mm gradient of imidazole-HCl, pH 8.0, increasing at 5 mm/ml. Fractions 33–40 (nominal imidazole concentration of 65–110 mm) containing the major peak of purified M1Pase, as determined both by enzyme activity and Western blot immunoreactivity, were pooled, yielding 15.1 mg of protein from 0.56 g wet weight bacterial pellet. Bacterial cells expressing the nonfusion M1Pase construct (1.17 g wet weight) were collected as described above and were sonicated (6 × 60 s) in 4 ml of buffer B (10 mm Hepes sodium, pH 7.4). The suspension was centrifuged (15 min, 40,000 ×g), and the supernatant volume was increased with buffer B to 10.1 ml. The supernatant (85.9 mg of protein) was injected onto a HiTrap Q anion exchange column (5 ml, chloride form) equilibrated with buffer B. The flow rate was 2.0 ml/min, and fractions (1.0 ml) were collected immediately. The column was washed with buffer B (15 ml) and then eluted using a 0–150 mm gradient of NaCl in buffer B increasing at 5 mm/ml. Fractions 29–35 (nominal NaCl concentration of 65–100 mm) containing the major peak of M1Pase were pooled, yielding 49.4 mg of protein. Methods for the continuous assay of M1Pase as well as the determination of Km, kcat, and IC50 values for inhibitors are described elsewhere.3 Unless otherwise noted, reactions (500 μl) were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES sodium buffer, pH 7.5, containingp-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP, 0.5 mm, 0.22 × Km, adjusted to pH 7.5) and DEPC (0–1330 μm). DEPC was quantitated spectrophotometrically by reaction with imidazole (6Melchior W.B. Fahrney D. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and delivered in acetonitrile (final concentration, 1% v/v). Reactions were initiated with the addition of purified PaseNR (36 μg). Absorbance at 400 nm was recorded as a function of time for 20 min using a Beckman DU70 spectrophotometer. M1Pase activity in the absence of DEPC remained linear under these conditions. Background rates of nonenzymatic PNPP hydrolysis under identical conditions were subtracted. Corrected A400 versus time data were analyzed by computer fitting to either linear (no DEPC present) or integrated first order equations (DEPC present) using methods previously described (14Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Taub D. Wilson K.E. Gimenez-Gallego G. Rosegay A. Soderman D.D. Patchett A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21657-21665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) analysis was performed using a Finnigan TSQ-7000 (San Jose, CA), as described previously (15Griffin P.R. Coffman J.A. Hood L.E. Yates J.R. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Processes. 1991; 111: 131-149Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Protein was incubated in the presence of 100 mm dithiothreitol at 52 °C for 15 min prior to analysis by LC-MS. Following treatment with dithiothreitol, samples were loaded on a C4 reverse phase column (1 × 100 mm) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min with 0.075% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a gradient of 2–60% acetonitrile over 40 min. The effluent was fed directly to the electrospray interface of the mass spectrometer. Ions were detected throughout the entire LC gradient over a m/z (mass to charge ratio) range of 500–2000. Repeated attempts to sequence biochemically purified native M1Pase were unsuccessful, implying that the amino terminus was blocked.3 Accordingly, the protein was subjected to tryptic digestion and peptide fragments were resolved by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Edman degradation analysis yielded the nine peptide sequences listed in TableI. The corresponding positions of the respective peptides within the protein sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clones encoding M1Pase are also illustrated beneath the schematic in Fig.1 B.Table IPrimary structure of tryptic peptides obtained from native M1Pase and their relative position within the open reading frame deduced from the cDNA clonesPeptideAmino acid sequenceCorresponding residues in the deduced amino acid sequence from the cDNAs21VFQGQVDYANNQLTQQGQQQAAAAAVal93–Ala11722SCIPQQLEAYASer20 –Ala3024VAELEKDDPAHVal177 –His18725AVHTAQPFVDANPKPLFAla142 –Phe15828ICCQLWQSPEIle205 –Glu21434EFKPLELPVDICYIRGlu67 –Arg8136VLPELAEMAFGEWDNRVal160 –Arg17538DQLGFLGFDGNYAsp282 –Tyr29339EFIPDGlu128 –Asp132 Open table in a new tab Three degenerate antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized based upon sequence contained within peptides 21, 36, and 38. These oligonucleotides were used as hybridization probes on Southern blots of E. tenella genomic DNA. Using several experimental conditions, only oligonucleotide 36-a (from peptide 36) gave discrete hybridization signals (Fig.2 A). Oligonucleotide 36-a was then used to screen an E. tenella cDNA library prepared from USO mRNA. Using identical hybridization conditions, no positives were detected in the 1.25 × 106recombinants that were screened. Acknowledging the possibility that mRNA coding for M1Pase might not be present in this developmental stage of the parasite's life cycle, E. tenella genomic DNA was preparatively digested with ApaI and size-fractionated DNA was extracted from agarose gel slices. A subgenomic DNA library, corresponding to the 3.5-kbApaI hybridization signal detected with oligonucleotide 36-a (Fig. 2 A), was prepared and screened. Clone 6L-11, a 3.42-kbApaI fragment, was isolated and characterized (schematically represented in Fig. 1 A). Nucleotide sequence analysis of this clone identified ORFs that contain seven of the nine tryptic peptide sequences listed in Table I. These seven tryptic peptide sequences were not all found in the same translational reading frame, implying that the genomic clone contains at least one intervening sequence. A 190-base pair portion of clone 6L-11 was chosen as a hybridization probe (Pase 1–2) and prepared in a PCR reaction using oligonucleotides Pase 1 (5′-AAA AGC TGC ATT CCG CAG CAG CTG-3′) and Pase 2 (5′-GGC GGA TGT AGC AAA TGT CCA CGG-3′). This region was selected because (i) the tryptic peptide sequences predicted that this is a contiguous ORF derived from what appears to be the amino-terminal domain of M1Pase, and (ii) there were no apparent DNA repeat sequences in this region (16Liberator P.A. Hsu J. Turner M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A genomic Southern blot using this hybridization probe is shown in Fig. 2 B. Pase 1–2 was then used to rescreen the oligo(dT)-primed E. tenella USO cDNA library, and several clones were isolated. These were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping, and four of the clones were fully sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the longest cDNA clone (T2a15, 1160 nt) are shown in Fig. 1 B. Each of the nine tryptic peptide sequences generated from native M1Pase purified from E. tenella USOs can be located within this ORF (Table Iand schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 B). On the assumption that the first methionine within this ORF represents the translation start site, the cDNA codes for a protein of 309 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 34,737 Da. This is in good agreement with the biochemically purified protein. LC-ESI-MS analysis of native M1Pase gave a molecular mass value of 34,648 Da.3From the deduced amino acid sequence, the theoretical mass for M1Pase that has lost its NH2-terminal methionine residue and has been subsequently acetylated at the amino terminus is 34,648 Da, identical to the experimental value found for the native enzyme. Support for post-translational modification at the amino terminus of M1Pase comes from our earlier observation that the native enzyme is refractory to NH2-terminal Edman sequencing. These data provide compelling evidence to suggest that the deduced amino acid sequence of M1Pase is correct and that the methionine residue corresponding to nucleotide positions 40–42 represents the initiation codon. The deduced amino acid sequence predicted by clone T2a15 did not exhibit significant homology to any data base entry. Enzymatic characterization of native M1Pase3suggested that it might be related to the phosphohistidine phosphotransferase family of enzymes (17Van Etten R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 390: 27-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Pilkis S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9642-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of E. tenella M1Pase shows limited overall homology to members of this group of enzymes. Accordingly, manual alignments were done with some representative members (TableII). A highly conserved diagnostic sequence motif among this family is the so-called “RHG” domain (18Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Pilkis S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9642-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Phosphoenzyme trapping experiments have shown that the histidine residue in this motif is phosphorylated as a reaction intermediate (19Pilkis S.J. Walderhaug M. Murray K. Beth A. Venkataramu S.D. Pilkis J. El-Maghrabi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6135-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tauler A. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2313-2319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis has confirmed the critical role that both the arginine and the histidine residues play in the catalytic reaction (22Lin K. Li L. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19163-19171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ostanin K. Saeed A. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8971-8978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. tenella M1Pase shares this sequence motif at residues 81–83. Furthermore, a second arginine residue at a relatively conserved distance from the RHG domain has been functionally identified as a contributor to substrate phosphate binding (22Lin K. Li L. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19163-19171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The arginine residue at position 141 of E. tenella M1Pase is in a compatible location and could prove to serve a similar role (TableII).Table IIManual alignment of putative active site residues in E. tenella M1Pase with active site residues from selected representatives of the phosphohistidine phosphotransferase familyEnzyme species2-aAccession numbers: rat liver Fru-2,6-P2, J04197; human liver Fru-2,6-P2, M19938; yeast PGM, X58789; human muscle PGM, M18172;E. coli acid Pase, X05471; human prostatic acid Pase,M34840.Sequence surrounding Arg81 of M1PaseSpacing between conserved arginyl residuesSequence surrounding Arg141 of M1PaseE. tenellaM1PaseCYIRHGKT59SSPLLRAVHRat liver Fru-2,6-P2YLCRHGES49TSHMKRTIQHuman liver Fru-2,6-P2YLCRHGES49TSRMKRTIQYeast PGMVLVRHGQS51TSKLSRAIQHuman muscle PGMVMVRHGET51TSVLKRAIRE. coli acid PaseIVSRHGVR75ADVDERTRKHuman prostatic acid PaseLVFRHGDR67STDVDRTLM2-a Accession numbers: rat liver Fru-2,6-P2, J04197; human liver Fru-2,6-P2, M19938; yeast PGM, X58789; human muscle PGM, M18172;E. coli acid Pase, X05471; human prostatic acid Pase,M34840. Open table in a new tab Two plasmid constructs were assembled for expression purposes in the bacterial host M15pREP4. Both a non-fusion M1Pase recombinant (PaseNR) and a fusion protein tagged at the COOH-terminal end with six histidine residues (PaseNRH) have been expressed. Upon induction of expression from these plasmids, a tremendous amount of protein with an approximate molecular mass of 35 kDa can be visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and 7). These bands co-migrate with native M1Pase (Fig.3 A, lane 8) and are not apparent in uninduced bacteria (lanes 4 and 6), or in bacteria that carry only the nonrecombinant expression plasmid pQE60 (lanes 1 and 2). Western blot analysis of this gel (Fig.3 B) with polyclonal antisera raised against native M1Pase supports the conclusion that these predominant protein products in induced bacteria are indeed recombinant expressed enzyme. A single Western blot-positive species co-migrates in this gel system with the native enzyme. The Western blot also demonstrates that there is some limited expression from the plasmid in the uninduced controls (Fig.3 B, lanes 4 and 6). However, bacteria carrying the nonrecombinant vector (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2) show no immunoreactivity. Many recombinant proteins have their NH2-terminal methionine removed when expressed in a bacterial host (24Hirel P.H. Schmitter J.M. Dessein P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). This appears to be the case with E. tenella M1Pase. Following purification, LC-ESI-MS analysis of non-histidine-tagged recombinant M1Pase yielded an experimental molecular mass of 34,603 Da. This is in excellent agreement with the theoretical molecular mass of 34,606 Da calculated for M1Pase that has lost its NH2-terminal methionine residue. These results further serve to indicate that M1Pase is accurately synthesized in bacteria and that the recombinant protein is essentially identical in primary structure to the native enzyme. Recombinant expressed M1Pase has also been fractionated by native PAGE and then assayed for enzymatic activity in situ, within the polyacrylamide matrix.3 The in-gel activity assay in Fig.4 A demonstrates that, following induction, bacteria harboring the E. tenellaM1Pase ORF are characterized by robust enzyme activity (lanes 5 and 7). Furthermore, this activity comigrates with the activity stain generated with purified native M1Pase (lane 8). Much like M1Pase purified from E. tenella, native PAGE is able to resolve two distinct bands of activity for the recombinant expressed enzymes. We have not been able to identify the biochemical feature responsible for this fractionation of activity. However, it is reproducible and it is observed for both native and recombinant enzyme preparations, but only in nondenaturing electrophoretic conditions. A Western blot of the native activity gel illustrates that the regions of M1Pase activity are also immunoreactive with antisera raised against the native enzyme (Fig. 4 B). Bacteria carrying the nonrecombinant pQE60 expression vector have no detectable M1Pase enzyme activity (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 2), nor are they Western blot-positive (Figs. 3 B and 4 B, lanes 1 and 2). Selected enzymatic properties of purified recombinant expressed M1Pase (both the nonfusion and the COOH-terminally tagged versions) were measured and compared with those obtained for the native enzyme. As shown in TableIII, the kinetic constants for the two recombinant enzyme preparations are virtually indistinguishable, suggesting that the COOH-terminal six histidine residues do not compromise phosphatase activity. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters are in good agreement with those reported for native M1Pase prepared from E. tenella USO. Sodium fluoride, an inhibitor of phosphatase activity, inhibits native M1Pase with an IC50value of 28 μm.3 The recombinant expressed enzymes are also sensitive to inhibitio"

https://openalex.org/W2324595523,"v-Ha-ras has been demonstrated previously to induce neuroendocrine differentiation of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC, malignant C cell tumor) cell lines. The potential role of ras mediated signaling in neuroendocrine cells in vivo has been investigated by expressing v-Ha-ras under control of the neural/neuroendocrine specific calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) promoter. Five independent mouse lineages were derived following germ line insertion of the transgene. Four of the five lineages consistently express the transgene; neuroendocrine expression is found in three of the five lineages as both spliced and full length messages. Phenotypically, the mice expressing rascal have shortened lifespans primarily due to the high incidence of MTCs between 6 months to a year of age. C-cell hyperplasia is demonstrated in several mice in the absence of gross evidence of tumor formation. Histopathological and ultrastructural analyses demonstrate typical features of MTCs including prominent immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin and dense-core neurosecretory-type granules. In addition, four of 22 tumors co-express thyroglobulin (a non-neuroendocrine follicular epithelial cell marker) and calcitonin (a neuroendocrine marker) in a subset of the tumor cells. The rascal transgenic mouse provides a unique model for investigating the sequential pathogenesis of MTC and possibly also for elucidating the relationship between MTC and mixed medullary-follicular carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2011156134,"In C2 myoblasts, retinoic acid (RA) is an efficient inducer of both growth arrest and differentiation. These RA effects are mediated through at least two classes of retinoic acid receptors (RARs and RXRs), which belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. To determine the role played by each RAR or RXR family in this model system, we have analysed the effects of RA in C2 myoblasts expressing a dominant negative RAR (dnRAR) or a dominant negative RXR (dnRXR). The stable expression of dnRAR or dnRXR in C2 cells delays the RA-induced growth arrest and differentiation, an effect which is more pronounced in C2-dnRXR myoblasts. Furthermore, the RA-inducible expression of MyoD gene is lost in C2-dnRXR but not in C2-dnRAR cells, indicating that each family of retinoid receptors RAR and RXR may regulate distinct subsets of RA-responsive genes. Finally, using C2 cell lines with different retinoid responsiveness, we provided evidence for a link between the RXR and MyoD families in the process of myogenic differentiation. These results illustrate a critical role for RA-receptors in RA-control of C2 myogenesis and provide tools for studying the function of RA and its receptors during vertebrate development."

It is structurally related to the activating ligands, in that it is a secreted protein with a single epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain. To understand the mechanism of Argos inhibition, we have investigated which regions of the protein are essential. A series of deletions were made and tested in vivo; furthermore, by analyzing chimeric proteins between Argos and the activating ligand, Spitz (a transforming growth factor-α-like factor), we have examined what makes one inhibitory and the other activating. Our results reveal that Argos has structural requirements that differ from all known EGFR activating ligands; domains flanking the EGF domain are essential for its function. We have also defined the important regions of the atypical Argos EGF domain. The extended B-loop is necessary, whereas the C-loop can be replaced with the equivalent Spitz region without substantially affecting Argos function. Comparison of theargos genes from Drosophila melanogaster and the housefly, Musca domestica, supports our structure-function analysis.

In flies, there is only one such receptor and it is equally similar to all four of theerbB genes of mammals, suggesting that it is the prototype receptor of the mammalian family (22Schejter E.D.

Its activating ligands fall into the recognized classes of mammalian ligands; Spitz and Gurken are TGFα-like molecules, whereas Vein resembles the neuregulins (24Rutledge B.J. Zhang K. Bier E.

Argos has the hallmarks of an EGFR ligand in that it is a secreted protein with a single EGF domain (albeit atypical) (27Freeman M. Klämbt C. Goodman C.S. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 963-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Kretzschmar D. Brunner A. Wiersdorff V. Pflugfelder G.O. Heisenberg M. Schneuwly S.

Differentiation. 1992; 52: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to inhibit EGFR activation both in tissue culture and in the developing fly (30Schweitzer R. Howes R. Smith R. Shilo B.-Z. Freeman M. Nature. 1995; 376: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). EGFR activity is required for many aspects of fly development (20Schweitzer R. Shilo B.-Z. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 191-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Of relevance to this work, EGFR triggers the differentiation of cells in the eye and the wing vein (21Freeman M. Cell. 1996; 87: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar,31Sturtevant M.A. Roark M. Bier E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Loss of activity in the pathway (e.g. by loss-of-function mutations in EGFR or its activating ligands, or hyperactivity of Argos) causes loss of these structures; gain of activity (e.g. by loss-of-function mutations in argos) causes extra cells in the eye and wing veins.We would like to understand the mechanism of EGFR inhibition by Argos for theoretical and practical reasons. Our goal is to identify which parts of the molecule are necessary for its function to help design mammalian EGFR antagonists. To these ends, we have explored which parts of the Argos protein are essential for its inhibitory function. We have also compared it with the activating ligand, Spitz, to understand the structural elements that make one an activator and the other an inhibitor of the EGF receptor. With a similar goal, two groups have recently reported attempts to make chimeras between human EGF and the EGF domain of Argos, but neither succeeded in producing an inhibitor of the human EGFR (32van de Poll M.L.M. van Vugt M.J.H. Lenferink A.E.G. van Zoelen E.J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7425-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Lohmeyer M. Mason S. Gullick W.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1997; 10: 677-682PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest several reasons for this; although the atypical EGF domain is indeed a key element of Argos's inhibitory functions, other regions of the protein are also essential. These findings distinguish Argos from all other EGF-like factors, which appear to interact with the EGFR solely through the EGF domain; they also suggest that rational design of EGFR inhibitors should eventually be possible.DISCUSSIONThe wide range of functions of the members of the EGF receptor family is reflected in their large number of different activating ligands (54Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Derynck R. Cell. 1988; 54: 593-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 56Riese D.J.

The mature forms of EGF and TGFα are polypeptides that comprise a single EGF domain and little else (8Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The neuregulins are much larger; they include a C-terminal EGF domain and a long N-terminal region, which may modulate their action (59Carraway K.L. Burden S.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A minimal EGF domain from the neuregulins is sufficient to bind and activate their receptor (60Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.Y. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7111-7116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF have very basic domains immediately N-terminal to their EGF domains, which are necessary for heparin binding and full biological activity (62Johnson G.R. Wong L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27149-27154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 63Aviezer D. Yayon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12173-12177Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have shown that Argos, which is extended N- and C-terminally compared with EGF, and which is the only known EGF receptor inhibitor, has different structural requirements to any of the known activating ligands. For Argos to be an effective inhibitor, it needs its own EGF domain, the whole adjacent C terminus of the protein, and some of the region immediately N-terminal to the EGF domain (note that this region does not resemble the lysine-arginine rich heparin-binding regions of amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF).Recently, the only other known inhibitor of an receptor tyrosine kinase has been identified. This factor, angiopoietin-2, is structurally very similar to the activating ligand for the Tie-2 receptor, which it blocks (64Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar). Although Ang-2 binds the receptor, it fails to activate it, providing a simple explanation for its antagonistic function. The mechanism of Argos function must be more complex since it will inhibit ligand-independent activation of the receptor, which can be induced in tissue culture cells (30Schweitzer R. Howes R. Smith R. Shilo B.-Z. Freeman M. Nature. 1995; 376: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This implies that Argos does not act by binding to and sequestering ligand, nor does it simply block the ligand binding site on the receptor. Receptor tyrosine kinases are activated by ligand-induced dimerization or oligomerization (65Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar), suggesting a simple mechanism for blocking receptor activation; we hypothesize that Argos inhibits EGFR dimerization. Our discovery that sequences from outside the EGF domain are essential for its function suggests that these extra domains participate in the hypothesized block to receptor dimerization. Note that, although there is strong circumstantial evidence that Argos acts directly on the receptor, the biochemical demonstration has yet to be reported. It is, however, clear that the inhibition occurs at the receptor itself (30Schweitzer R. Howes R. Smith R. Shilo B.-Z. Freeman M. Nature. 1995; 376: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), so the general proposal that Argos acts by causing a block to EGFR dimerization could hold even if it works indirectly.As well as identifying new functional domains of Argos, our results shed light on which parts of its EGF domain are essential for Argos to inhibit the receptor. The extended B-loop, which includes the C3-C4 stretch of amino acids, is an obvious candidate for being involved in Argos's unusual inhibitory action. We have shown that if this loop is replaced by the corresponding region of the Spitz EGF domain, which resembles human EGF, Argos function is abolished. This supports the idea that this region is necessary and participates in Argos inhibition. The B-loop in Musca Argos is of identical length and near-identical sequence to Drosophila Argos, consistent with its functional importance. Indeed, this spacing is also identical in Argos from the butterfly, Precis coenia, which diverged from Drosophila more than 200 million years ago, 4M. Kengaku and C. Tabin, personal communication. further supporting this conclusion. Interestingly, myxoma virus growth factor, which is related to EGF, has a slightly extended B-loop (13 amino acid residues) and activates the EGFR 200-fold less effectively than EGF (66Lin Y.Z. Ke X.H. Tam J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3310-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Despite intensive study, the role of this domain, which forms a β-sheet in human EGF, is still not clear, but there is substantial evidence implicating it in receptor binding and/or activation (11Komoriya A.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The C-loop of EGF domains also contains critical residues for EGFR activation (9van Zoelen E.J.J. Lenferink A.E.G. Kramer R.H. van de Poll M.L.M. Pathol. Res. Practice. 1996; 192: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 13van de Poll M.L.M. Lenferink A.E.G. van Vugt M.J.H. Jacobs J.J.L. Janssen J.W.H.

Both Spitz and Argos contain the two key amino acids (Gly-39 and Arg-41 from human EGF; Fig. 3 A), but in other ways the Argos C-loop looks very different from all known activating ligands, including Spitz. It is shorter and has increased positive charge; it is also identical in Musca, so it is surprising that replacing it with the more typical Spitz C-loop has little effect on Argos function. Perhaps the C-loop is necessary for receptor binding, but not for conferring inhibitory properties, making it is replaceable by a similar loop from another DrosophilaEGFR-binding protein, Spitz.A naturally occurring EGFR inhibitor like Argos might have therapeutic value in humans. We have failed to isolate mammalian homologues of Argos by various techniques, and it is possible that an EGFR inhibitor has evolved only in insects. We think it more likely that the conservation of EGF-like domains is not high enough over long enough stretches (their main conserved features are the spacing of cysteines and a few other critical amino acids) to make them easy to clone over long evolutionary distances. (Drosophila diverged from vertebrates 600–1000 million years ago). We are more hopeful of engineering an antagonist based on known mammalian ligands, as has been tried by several groups (9van Zoelen E.J.J. Lenferink A.E.G. Kramer R.H. van de Poll M.L.M. Pathol. Res.

In flies, there is only one such receptor and it is equally similar to all four of theerbB genes of mammals, suggesting that it is the prototype receptor of the mammalian family (22Schejter E.D.

Its activating ligands fall into the recognized classes of mammalian ligands; Spitz and Gurken are TGFα-like molecules, whereas Vein resembles the neuregulins (24Rutledge B.J. Zhang K. Bier E.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2302-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). There is also a unique extracellular inhibitor of the fly EGFR called Argos. Argos has the hallmarks of an EGFR ligand in that it is a secreted protein with a single EGF domain (albeit atypical) (27Freeman M. Klämbt C. Goodman C.S. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 963-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Kretzschmar D. Brunner A. Wiersdorff V. Pflugfelder G.O. Heisenberg M. Schneuwly S.

Differentiation. 1992; 52: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to inhibit EGFR activation both in tissue culture and in the developing fly (30Schweitzer R. Howes R. Smith R. Shilo B.-Z. Freeman M. Nature. 1995; 376: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). EGFR activity is required for many aspects of fly development (20Schweitzer R. Shilo B.-Z. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 191-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Of relevance to this work, EGFR triggers the differentiation of cells in the eye and the wing vein (21Freeman M. Cell. 1996; 87: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar,31Sturtevant M.A. Roark M. Bier E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Loss of activity in the pathway (e.g. by loss-of-function mutations in EGFR or its activating ligands, or hyperactivity of Argos) causes loss of these structures; gain of activity (e.g. by loss-of-function mutations in argos) causes extra cells in the eye and wing veins. We would like to understand the mechanism of EGFR inhibition by Argos for theoretical and practical reasons. Our goal is to identify which parts of the molecule are necessary for its function to help design mammalian EGFR antagonists. To these ends, we have explored which parts of the Argos protein are essential for its inhibitory function. We have also compared it with the activating ligand, Spitz, to understand the structural elements that make one an activator and the other an inhibitor of the EGF receptor. With a similar goal, two groups have recently reported attempts to make chimeras between human EGF and the EGF domain of Argos, but neither succeeded in producing an inhibitor of the human EGFR (32van de Poll M.L.M. van Vugt M.J.H. Lenferink A.E.G. van Zoelen E.J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7425-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Lohmeyer M. Mason S. Gullick W.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1997; 10: 677-682PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest several reasons for this; although the atypical EGF domain is indeed a key element of Argos's inhibitory functions, other regions of the protein are also essential. These findings distinguish Argos from all other EGF-like factors, which appear to interact with the EGFR solely through the EGF domain; they also suggest that rational design of EGFR inhibitors should eventually be possible. DISCUSSIONThe wide range of functions of the members of the EGF receptor family is reflected in their large number of different activating ligands (54Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol.

The mature forms of EGF and TGFα are polypeptides that comprise a single EGF domain and little else (8Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The neuregulins are much larger; they include a C-terminal EGF domain and a long N-terminal region, which may modulate their action (59Carraway K.L. Burden S.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A minimal EGF domain from the neuregulins is sufficient to bind and activate their receptor (60Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.Y. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7111-7116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF have very basic domains immediately N-terminal to their EGF domains, which are necessary for heparin binding and full biological activity (62Johnson G.R. Wong L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27149-27154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 63Aviezer D. Yayon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12173-12177Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have shown that Argos, which is extended N- and C-terminally compared with EGF, and which is the only known EGF receptor inhibitor, has different structural requirements to any of the known activating ligands. For Argos to be an effective inhibitor, it needs its own EGF domain, the whole adjacent C terminus of the protein, and some of the region immediately N-terminal to the EGF domain (note that this region does not resemble the lysine-arginine rich heparin-binding regions of amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF).Recently, the only other known inhibitor of an receptor tyrosine kinase has been identified. This factor, angiopoietin-2, is structurally very similar to the activating ligand for the Tie-2 receptor, which it blocks (64Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar). Although Ang-2 binds the receptor, it fails to activate it, providing a simple explanation for its antagonistic function. The mechanism of Argos function must be more complex since it will inhibit ligand-independent activation of the receptor, which can be induced in tissue culture cells (30Schweitzer R. Howes R. Smith R. Shilo B.-Z. Freeman M. Nature. 1995; 376: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This implies that Argos does not act by binding to and sequestering ligand, nor does it simply block the ligand binding site on the receptor. Receptor tyrosine kinases are activated by ligand-induced dimerization or oligomerization (65Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar), suggesting a simple mechanism for blocking receptor activation; we hypothesize that Argos inhibits EGFR dimerization. Our discovery that sequences from outside the EGF domain are essential for its function suggests that these extra domains participate in the hypothesized block to receptor dimerization. Note that, although there is strong circumstantial evidence that Argos acts directly on the receptor, the biochemical demonstration has yet to be reported. It is, however, clear that the inhibition occurs at the receptor itself (30Schweitzer R. Howes R. Smith R. Shilo B.-Z. Freeman M. Nature. 1995; 376: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), so the general proposal that Argos acts by causing a block to EGFR dimerization could hold even if it works indirectly.As well as identifying new functional domains of Argos, our results shed light on which parts of its EGF domain are essential for Argos to inhibit the receptor. The extended B-loop, which includes the C3-C4 stretch of amino acids, is an obvious candidate for being involved in Argos's unusual inhibitory action. We have shown that if this loop is replaced by the corresponding region of the Spitz EGF domain, which resembles human EGF, Argos function is abolished. This supports the idea that this region is necessary and participates in Argos inhibition. The B-loop in Musca Argos is of identical length and near-identical sequence to Drosophila Argos, consistent with its functional importance. Indeed, this spacing is also identical in Argos from the butterfly, Precis coenia, which diverged from Drosophila more than 200 million years ago, 4M. Kengaku and C. Tabin, personal communication. further supporting this conclusion. Interestingly, myxoma virus growth factor, which is related to EGF, has a slightly extended B-loop (13 amino acid residues) and activates the EGFR 200-fold less effectively than EGF (66Lin Y.Z. Ke X.H. Tam J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3310-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Despite intensive study, the role of this domain, which forms a β-sheet in human EGF, is still not clear, but there is substantial evidence implicating it in receptor binding and/or activation (11Komoriya A.

Both Spitz and Argos contain the two key amino acids (Gly-39 and Arg-41 from human EGF; Fig. 3 A), but in other ways the Argos C-loop looks very different from all known activating ligands, including Spitz. It is shorter and has increased positive charge; it is also identical in Musca, so it is surprising that replacing it with the more typical Spitz C-loop has little effect on Argos function. Perhaps the C-loop is necessary for receptor binding, but not for conferring inhibitory properties, making it is replaceable by a similar loop from another DrosophilaEGFR-binding protein, Spitz.A naturally occurring EGFR inhibitor like Argos might have therapeutic value in humans. We have failed to isolate mammalian homologues of Argos by various techniques, and it is possible that an EGFR inhibitor has evolved only in insects. We think it more likely that the conservation of EGF-like domains is not high enough over long enough stretches (their main conserved features are the spacing of cysteines and a few other critical amino acids) to make them easy to clone over long evolutionary distances. (Drosophila diverged from vertebrates 600–1000 million years ago). We are more hopeful of engineering an antagonist based on known mammalian ligands, as has been tried by several groups (9van Zoelen E.J.J. Lenferink A.E.G. Kramer R.H. van de Poll M.L.M. Pathol. Res.

https://openalex.org/W2056875547,"Ectopic expression of the normal murine receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Kit, in NIH3T3 cells induced many phenotypic changes characteristic of transformation including anchorage-independent growth, focus formation and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Although transformation was largely dependent on the presence of recombinant murine Steel Factor (SLF), the ligand to the c-Kit receptor, anchorage independent growth did occur at a low frequency in the absence of added factor, and this could not be inhibited by neutralising antibodies or by SLF anti-sense mRNA. Clones from factor-independent colonies in semi-solid agar displayed a narrow range of c-Kit surface protein levels (4.3 – 6.4×104 receptors/cell) which was relatively high compared with the pool from which they were derived. Analysis of a larger series of random clones derived from adherent cultures expressing different levels of c-Kit demonstrated a positive correlation between SLF-dependent, anchorage-independent growth and c-Kit protein and mRNA expression levels (respectively, RS=0.58, P<0.01; and RS=0.53, P<0.01) with consistent colony formation observed with clones having >2.5×104 receptors/cell. Interestingly, two of the three clones expressing the highest levels of c-Kit protein and mRNA produced few or no colonies in the presence or absence of SLF. Sequential over-expression of human c-KIT in NIH3T3 cells using a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-encoding vector and gene co-amplification through methotrexate selection, which resulted in pools expressing up to 1.5×105 receptors/cell, confirmed that high receptor densities resulted in a decrease in colony numbers. Thus, analysis of clonal and selected populations has indicated that an optimal level of c-Kit is required for transformation of NIH3T3 cells in the presence of SLF, and that some ligand-independent transformation occurs."
https://openalex.org/W2009254263,"We have identified the regulatory elements, some of the factors and potential regulatory mechanisms which determine the tissue specificity of the human apoC-II gene. The −545/+18 apoC-II promoter directs high levels of expression of the reporter CAT gene in cells of hepatic origin (HepG2), low levels of expression in cells of intestinal origin (CaCo-2) and basal expression in HeLa cells. Deletion analysis identified negative regulatory elements within the −545/−388 region and positive regulatory elements within the −388/−55 region. Linkage of different apoC-II promoter segments to the hepatic control region-1 (HCR-1) enhanced the promoter activity 2.5–11-fold in HepG2 cells but did not affect its activity in CaCo-2 or COS-1 cells. DNase I footprinting analysis using rat liver nuclear extracts identified five protected regions within the −545/+18 apoC-II promoter as follows: CIIA (−74/−44), CIIB (−102/−81), CIIC (−159/−116), CIID (−288/−265), and CIIE (−497/−462). Elements CIIB and CIIC contain hormone response elements. CIIB is recognized by hepatic nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) but not ARP-1 or EAR-2, whereas CIIC is recognized by ARP-1 and EAR-2 but not by HNF-4. HNF-4 transactivated the apoC-II promoter or the apoC-II promoter linked to the HCR-1 in COS-1 cells. A double mutation in elements CIIB and CIIC that eliminated binding of HNF-4 or ARP-1 and EAR-2, respectively, to these sites abolished the enhancer activity of HCR-1. The combined data suggest that the apoC-II promoter/HCR-1 cluster can direct expression in cells of hepatic origin and that optimal enhancer activity requires synergistic interactions between factors bound to the distal HCR-1 and nuclear receptors bound to the two proximal hormone response elements."
https://openalex.org/W2158455373,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) elicit biological effects by binding to high affinity cell-surface receptors and activation of receptor tyrosine kinase. We previously reported that two NIH/3T3 derivatives, NR31 and NR33 (NR cells), express high levels of full-length FGF-1 and exhibit a complete spectrum of transformed phenotype. In the present study, we report that NR cells respond to the mitogenic stimulation of truncated FGF-1 but not to the full-length FGF-1. Incubation of the NR cells with either form of FGF-1 resulted in its binding to cell-surface FGF receptors, activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and induction of c-fos and c-myc. These data demonstrate that the FGF receptor-mediated, MAP kinase-dependent signaling pathway is not defective in the NR cells. Our data further suggest that the activation of MAP kinase in response to full-length FGF-1 is not sufficient for mitogenesis. Subcellular distribution of exogenously added FGF-1 demonstrated that full-length FGF-1 fails to translocate to the nuclei of NR31 cells. Although the full-length FGF-1 was detected in the nuclear fractions of both NIH/3T3 and NR33 cells, its half-life is much shortened in NR33 than in NIH/3T3 cells. These observations suggest that non-responsiveness of the two NR cell lines may be due to defectiveness at different steps of nuclear translocation mechanism of FGF-1.

They modulate cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. FGFs also regulate angiogenesis, embryogenesis, and neurite outgrowth (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 2Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGFs elicit these functions mainly by binding to high affinity cell-surface receptors and activating a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (3Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 4Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). FGF activation of FGFR1 triggers autophosphorylation on at least seven tyrosine residues (5Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). One of these sites, Tyr-766 of FGFR1, serves as a binding site for phospholipase C-γ (6Mohammadi M. Homagger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation of this site abrogates association and activation of phospholipase C-γ and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis but not FGF-1-mediated mitogenesis in L6 myoblast and BaF3 cells or differentiation of PC12 cells (7Peters K.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14419-14423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, autophosphorylation of Tyr-766 may be required for efficient endocytosis of FGF receptors (10Sorokin A. Mohammadi M. Huang J. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17056-17061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of Tyr-653 and Tyr-654 is required for intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The mutation of other autophosphorylation sites of FGFR1 did not affect FGF-1-dependent cell proliferation in L6 myoblasts or neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells. The mutation of these four autophosphorylation sites together or even including Tyr-766 of FGFR1 also did not affect FGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Shc and a Grb2-associated 90-kDa protein or activation of MAP kinase (MAPK/ERK; see Ref. 5Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). FGFR1 triggers activation of at least two pathways, a Ras-dependent and a phospholipase C-γ-dependent protein kinase C pathway. Both pathways converge on a common signaling molecule Raf-1 and then activate the downstream MAPK signaling cascade and mitogenesis (11Huang J. Mohammadi M. Rodrigues G.A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5065-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated that Ras-dependent MAPK signaling pathway is important for FGFR1-mediated biological responses (12Umbhauer M. Marshall C.J. Mason C.S. Old R.W. Smith J.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 13MacNicol A.M. Muslin A.J. Williams L.T.

Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1 and MAPK is sufficient for FGFR-mediated mitogenesis in BaF3 cell line expressing FGFR1 (11Huang J. Mohammadi M. Rodrigues G.A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5065-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The use of interfering mutants of MAPK showed that MAPK is necessary for fibroblast proliferation (15Pagés G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). FGF-mediated activation of MAPK is necessary and sufficient for mesoderm induction in Xenopus (12Umbhauer M. Marshall C.J. Mason C.S. Old R.W. Smith J.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Activation of MAPK is also shown to be involved in cellular transformation and differentiation (16Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). Expression of the constitutively activated MAPK kinase (MEK) in NIH/3T3 cells results in transformation of NIH/3T3 cells that closely resemble Ras-transformed NIH/3T3 cells and results in differentiation of PC12 cells (16Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). However, other reports showed that the activation of MAPK pathway is insufficient to promote FGF- (17Renaud F. Desset S. Oliver L. Gimenez-Gallego G. Van Obberghen E. Courtois Y. Laurent M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2801-2811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or PDGF (18Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)-mediated differentiation of PC12 cells. MAPK has been implicated as a critical component of the mitogenic signal transduction cascade and is likely to play a role in cellular pathways that control growth and differentiation (19Thomas G. Cell. 1992; 68: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 21Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). MAPK belongs to a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are activated in response to a variety of stimuli and growth factors. MAPK is a potent pleiotropic regulator of biological responses, and it requires dual phosphorylation at tyrosine and threonine residues for full catalytic activity (22Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B Anderson N.G. Erickson A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar). MAPK can be activated by both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent pathways (24Burgering B.M. DeVries-Smits A.M. Medema R.H. Van Weeren P.C. Tertoolen L.G. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7248-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and activation of MAPK is mediated by MEK. The activation of MEK is regulated by either Raf or MEK kinase (25Nishida E. Gottoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar); activated MEK in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK (26Gomez N. Cohen P. Nature. 1991; 353: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Activated MAPK translocates to the nucleus and is shown to activate and/or phosphorylate several important signaling elements such as p90Rsk, p62Tcf, c-jun, and c-myc (20Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 27Pelech S.L. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 513-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Seth A. Alvarez E. Gupta S. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23521-23524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, MAPK provides a link between the receptor tyrosine kinase cascade and the serine/threonine protein kinase cascade and also between cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling processes. Three different forms of FGF-1 have been reported (29Burgess W.H. Mehlman T. Marshak D.R. Fraser R.A. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Thomas K.A. Rios-Candelore M. Gimenez-Gallego G. DiSalvo J. Bennett C. Rodkey J. Fitzpatrick S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6409-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The two truncated forms have deletion of the first 14 or 20 amino acids (aa) from the full-length, 154-aa form based on the predicted amino acid sequence of the FGF-1 gene (31Wang W.-P. Lehtoma K. Varban M.L. Krishnan I. Chiu I.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There has not been any reported difference in the biological response between the full-length and truncated FGF-1 proteins (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 32Mason I.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 547-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that translocation of FGF-1 to the nucleus is essential for FGF-induced mitogenesis. Deletion of nuclear localization sequence (NLS), from aa 21 to 27, abolished the mitogenic activity of FGF-1 without affecting receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and induction of c-fosexpression (33Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier J.A.M. Hla T. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide containing NLS of FGF-1 and cell membrane-permeable sequence is able to stimulate DNA synthesis in an FGFR-independent manner (34Lin Y.-Z. Yao S.Y. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5305-5308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A dual mode of signaling pathway for FGF-1 has thus been proposed (35Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.O. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 36Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.O. Rapak A. Munoz R. Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). FGF-1 in fusion with diphtheria toxin is able to translocate, through diphtheria toxin receptor, into cells lacking functional FGF-1 receptors and induces DNA synthesis without detectable increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. The translocation of the fusion protein into cytosol and subsequently to the nucleus is essential for DNA synthesis. The receptor-mediated transduction pathway is necessary for other cellular processes including cell division and proliferation (35Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.O. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the characterization of various transfectants of NIH/3T3 expressing full-length human FGF-1. The expression of high levels of FGF-1 resulted in transformation of NIH/3T3 cells (37Bunnag P. Waddell K.S. Varban M.L. Chiu I.-M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1991; 27: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the transfectants, NR31 and NR33 (NR cells) which express high levels of full-length FGF-1 (154 aa), respond to the mitogenic stimulation of truncated FGF-1 (deletion of aa 1–14) but fail to respond to full-length FGF-1. Significantly, MAPK can be activated in NR cells with either full-length or truncated FGF-1. The subcellular distribution of exogenously added FGF-1 indicated that the full-length FGF-1 is unable to translocate to the nucleus of NR31 cells. Although the full-length FGF-1 was detected in the nuclear fractions of both NIH/3T3 and NR33 cells, its half-life is much shortened in NR33 than in NIH/3T3 cells. These observations suggest that non-responsiveness of the two NR cell lines may be due to defectiveness at different steps of nuclear translocation mechanism of FGF-1. Full-length recombinant human (full-length rhFGF-1, aa 1–154) and truncated recombinant human FGF-1 (ΔrhFGF-1, aa 15–154) were cloned in prokaryotic pET20b(+) expression system (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described (38Patrie K. Botelho M.J. Ray S.K. Mehta V. Chiu I.-M. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Full-length rhFGF-1 from NR31 (NhFGF-1; aa 1–154) was purified as described (37Bunnag P. Waddell K.S. Varban M.L. Chiu I.-M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1991; 27: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PDGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), native bovine brain FGF-1 from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and calf serum and heparin from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was kindly provided by T. Roberts and B. Druker (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Monoclonal anti-p42ERK2 antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse, or rabbit IgG and myelin basic protein (MBP) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-p44ERK1antibody and monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (Pab 240) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-bovine FGF-1 antibody was from Promega (Madison, WI). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) immunodetection system were from Amersham Corp. Na125I was obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA), [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dCTP, and [3H]thymidine were from NEN Life Science Products. Prehybridization and hybridization reagents for Northern blot analysis were from 5 Prime → 3 Prime (Boulder, CO). The NIH/3T3-derived stable transfectants (NR and Tr cell lines) overexpressing full-length rhFGF-1 have been described (37Bunnag P. Waddell K.S. Varban M.L. Chiu I.-M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1991; 27: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The stable transfectants were maintained in media supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. Near-confluent monolayer cells were starved in media containing 0.5% calf serum for 48 h. The DNA synthesis was initiated by addition of 5 ng/ml various mitogens, and cells were incubated for an additional 20 h. Cells were then pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 6 h. The level of DNA synthesis was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material as described previously (37Bunnag P. Waddell K.S. Varban M.L. Chiu I.-M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1991; 27: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Near-confluent monolayer NIH/3T3, NR31 and NR33, cells were starved in media containing 0.5% calf serum for 48 h. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and once with serum-free media containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10 μg/ml heparin, and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Stimulation was performed by addition of 30 ng/ml full-length or ΔrhFGF-1 at 37 °C for 10 min. Control and FGF-stimulated cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and harvested by scraping in PBS. The cells were pelleted and suspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mmTris (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 0.1% sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cell debris. For analysis of FGFR1 mRNA levels, total RNA was isolated from cells grown in the presence of 10% calf serum. For analysis of induction of immediate early genes, near-confluent cells were starved and stimulated with 30 ng/ml full-length or ΔrhFGF-1 for 0–4 h as described above. Cells were lysed in 4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, and total RNA was isolated using 5.7 m CsCl density gradient essentially as described (31Wang W.-P. Lehtoma K. Varban M.L. Krishnan I. Chiu I.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Samples containing 10 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on 1% formaldehyde gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The RNA was immobilized by baking the membrane at 80 °C for 2 h prior to hybridization with cDNA probes for human FGFR1 and mouse c-fos or c-myc. cDNA probe for cyclophilin gene was used as an internal control. The probes were generated with [α-32P]dCTP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) using rediprime random primer labeling kit as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). The hybridization was carried out in 50% formamide solution (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.) containing 32P-labeled probes (1 × 106 cpm/ml) and 10% dextran sulfate at 42 °C for 20 h. At the end of the hybridization period, the filter was washed twice with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and once at 50 °C followed by an additional wash at room temperature for 15 min each and subjected to autoradiography. FGF-1 was radioiodinated with Na125I using the chloramine-T method as described (39Patrie K.M. Kudla A.J. Olwin B.B. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29018-29024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Iodinated protein was purified on a heparin-agarose column. FGF-1 bound to heparin-agarose column was eluted from the column with elution buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.2% BSA, and 2.0m NaCl. When subjected to SDS-PAGE, iodinated as well as unlabeled full-length rhFGF-1 migrated as a single band. The biological activity of the labeled rhFGF-1 was determined by its ability to stimulate DNA synthesis of serum-starved NIH/3T3 cells. The specific activity of the different preparation of 125I-rhFGF-1 varied between 1 and 3 × 105 cpm/ng. The binding assay was performed as follows. Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 48 h later and incubated in 1 ml of binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mmHEPES (pH 7.3), 0.2% BSA, and 10 μg/ml heparin) at 4 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in 0.2 ml of binding buffer containing serial dilution of full-length 125I-rhFGF-1 at 4 °C for 3 h. Nonspecific binding was obtained in a parallel assay using the same serial dilution of full-length125I-rhFGF-1 but in the presence of 100-fold excess of non-radioactive rhFGF-1. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed twice with cold binding buffer and once with cold PBS containing 1.0 m NaCl and then solubilized in 0.25m NaOH. Bound radioactivity in duplicate samples was measured in a Beckman gamma counter, and data were subjected to Scatchard analysis (40Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17798) Google Scholar). To detect phosphorylated p44ERK1 and p42ERK2 in gel shift experiments, cell lysates containing 25 μg of protein were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The nonspecific sites on the nitrocellulose membrane were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.9% NaCl) containing 3% BSA for 2 h. The blot was then incubated with either anti-p44ERK1 or anti-p42ERK2 antibody at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in TBS containing 1% BSA at room temperature for 6 h. Following two washes in TBS at room temperature for 10 min each, the blot was incubated in 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody at room temperature for 2 h. The blot was washed as above, and the immune complexes were detected by color reaction of alkaline phosphatase substrate reagents (Upstate Biotechnology). To detect p53 protein in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, anti-p53 antibody was used as the primary antibody. For detection of tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK in NR and NIH/3T3 cells, antibodies to p42ERK2 and p44ERK1 (5 μg) were incubated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose (50% slurry) in 300 μl of PBS at 4 °C for 6 h. Antibody/protein A-agarose conjugates were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and cell lysates containing 500 μg of protein in 300 μl of lysis buffer were then added to anti-p42ERK2 and p44ERK1 protein A-agarose conjugates and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Following incubation, immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and solubilized in SDS sample buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 as described above. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p42ERK2 and p44ERK1were visualized by color reaction of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. In a parallel experiment, immunoprecipitates of anti-p42ERK2 antibody were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-p42ERK2 antibody followed by incubation with 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody in TBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and ECL development to confirm the migration and abundance of the protein in immunoprecipitates. The in-gel kinase assay using MBP as a substrate was performed as described (41Wang H.-C. Erikson R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates containing 20 μg of protein were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE containing 0.4 mg/ml MBP. The MBP/SDS-PAGE gel was washed with buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 5.5), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% isopropyl alcohol. The gel was denatured and renatured as described (41Wang H.-C. Erikson R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The renatured gel was then incubated in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 15 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.3 mm sodium orthovanadate) at 22 °C for 30 min. Kinase reaction was carried out by incubating the gel in kinase buffer containing 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 50 μm ATP at 22 °C for 30 min. The gel was washed three times with 1% pyrophosphate in 5% trichloroacetic acid, dried and subjected to autoradiography. Serum-starved cells grown in 35-mm Petri dishes were incubated in the presence of iodinated full-length or truncated rhFGF-1 at different temperatures and times. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed three times with serum-free medium and three times with PBS. Lysis buffer was then added to the monolayer cells (PBS containing 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 200 units/ml aprotinin, 100 units/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The cells were harvested by scraping and incubated on ice for additional 15 min. The cell lysates were then fractionated into cytosol and nuclear fractions as described (35Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.O. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was designated as cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed three times in lysis buffer containing 0.4 m sucrose and layered over lysis buffer containing 0.7 m sucrose and centrifuged as above. This fractionation step was repeated two more times. The pellet representing a nuclear fraction was resuspended in lysis buffer, sonicated, and freeze-thawed twice. The total protein content in cytosolic and nuclear fractions was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. Ten μg of total proteins from each sample were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To monitor the purity of subcellular fractionation, the amount of p53 in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was determined by Western blotting analysis. We previously described that four NIH/3T3 derivatives (Tr31-5-1, Tr33-1-2, Tr34-4-1, and Tr34-1-1) stably transfected with full-length human FGF-1 cDNA in a retroviral expression vector are able to form foci, acquire anchorage independence, and can induce tumor formation in nude mice (37Bunnag P. Waddell K.S. Varban M.L. Chiu I.-M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1991; 27: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We further showed that these four transfectants, unlike the parental NIH/3T3, produce an FGF-1-like mitogen, which was eluted off of a heparin-Sepharose column at 1.2m NaCl and can stimulate serum-starved NIH/3T3 to synthesize DNA (37Bunnag P. Waddell K.S. Varban M.L. Chiu I.-M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1991; 27: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Among the four transfectants, only Tr31-5-1 and Tr33-1-2 produced high levels of FGF-1 as determined by RNase protection analysis, Western blotting analysis, and [3H]thymidine incorporation assay (37Bunnag P. Waddell K.S. Varban M.L. Chiu I.-M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1991; 27: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Initially, we examined the ability of various mitogens to stimulate DNA synthesis in various transfectants and NIH/3T3 cells. All transfectants displayed stronger mitogenic response to calf serum and PDGF than parental NIH/3T3 cells did. Surprisingly, Tr31-5-1 and Tr33-1-2 responded to the FGF-1 purified from Tr31-5-1 (NhFGF-1) in stimulating DNA synthesis only at 1.7 and 7.9%, respectively, the level of NIH/3T3 cells (Fig.1). Tr31-5-1 and Tr33-1-2 transfectants are hence designated as NR31 and NR33 cells, respectively. The lack of response of NR cells to NhFGF-1 cannot be attributed to the trivial explanation of a defective mitogen as NhFGF-1 is mitogenic for Swiss/3T3, NIH/3T3, Tr34-4-1, Tr34-1-1, and an FGF-1 antisense transfectant Tr31-11-1 (Fig. 1). The lack of response of NR31 and NR33 was specific to NhFGF-1 as these cells can stil"
https://openalex.org/W2033912707,"Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) is one of four flavoproteins which catalyze the initial step of the mitochondrial β-oxidation spiral. By sequence comparison with other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, Glu-422 of VLCAD has been presumed to be the catalytic residue that abstracts the α-proton in the αβ-dehydrogenation reaction. Replacing Glu-422 with glutamine (E422Q) caused a loss of enzyme activity by preventing the formation of a charge transfer complex between VLCAD and palmitoyl-CoA. This result provides further evidence for Glu-422 being part of the active site of VLCAD. F418L is a disease-causing mutation in human VLCAD deficiency. Unlike wild-type VLCAD, F418L and F418V contained no bound FAD when expressed at extremely high levels in the baculovirus expression system. Although F418T and F418Y bound FAD at a level similar to that of wild-type VLCAD, both showed reduced <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values toward palmitoyl-CoA, most likely due to a decrease in the rate of enzyme-bound FAD reduction. These data suggest that Phe-418 is involved in the binding and subsequent reduction of FAD. FAD-deficient VLCADs (F418L, F418V, and apo-VLCAD) showed increased sensitivity to trypsinization. Loss of FAD may change the folding of VLCAD subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1964514471,"Collagen-tailed asymmetric acetylcholinesterase (AChE) forms are believed to be anchored to the synaptic basal lamina via electrostatic interactions involving proteoglycans. However, it was recently found that in avian and rat muscles, high ionic strength or polyanionic buffers could not detach AChE from cell-surface clusters and that these buffers solubilized intracellular non-junctional asymmetric AChE rather than synaptic forms of the enzyme. In the present study, asymmetric AChE forms were specifically solubilized by ionic buffers from synaptic basal lamina-enriched fractions, largely devoid of intracellular material, obtained from the electric organ of Torpedo californica and the end plate regions of rat diaphragm muscle. Furthermore, foci of AChE activity were seen to diminish in size, number, and staining intensity when the rat synaptic basal lamina-enriched preparations were treated with the extraction buffers. In the case of Torpedo, almost all the AChE activity was removed from the pure basal lamina sheets. We therefore conclude that a major portion of extracellular collagen-tailed AChE is extractable from rat and Torpedo synaptic basal lamina by high ionic strength and heparin buffers, although some non-extractable AChE activity remains associated with the junctional regions.

The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 1The abbreviations used are: AChE, acetylcholinesterase; BL, basal lamina; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; iso-OMPA, tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide. plays a key role in cholinergic neurotransmission (1Eccles J.C. Katz B. Kuffler S.W. J. Neurophysiol. 1942; 5: 211-220Crossref Google Scholar). Its predominant form at the neuromuscular junction is the collagen-tailed asymmetric form, A12, which is located on the extracellular surface positioned for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. Most of this junctional AChE is associated with the basal lamina (BL), located between the nerve ending and the muscle plasma membrane (2Hall Z.W. J. Neurobiol. 1973; 4: 343-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 3McMahan U.J. Sanes J.R. Marshall L.M. Nature. 1978; 271: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and can be removed from the cell surface of muscle tissue (4Hall Z.W. Kelly R.B. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 232: 62-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Betz W. Sakmann B. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1973; 230: 673-688Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and mouse myotubes (6Inestrosa N.C. Silberstein L. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1982; 29: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) by treatment with collagenase, indicating that the collagenic tail of the enzyme is involved in its anchorage to the BL (7Inestrosa N.C. Perelman A. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 118: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4025-4028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms by which asymmetric AChE forms are anchored to the BL remain elusive (9Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Valette F.-M. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf .). 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), there is compelling evidence to suggest that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) or related proteoglycans are involved (7Inestrosa N.C. Perelman A. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 118: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Inestrosa N.C. Gordon H. Esko J.D. Hall Z.W. Shafferman A. Velan B. Multidisciplinary Approaches to Cholinesterase Functions. Plenum Press, New York1992: 51-58Google Scholar). This evidence includes the recent finding that A12 has two heparin-binding consensus sequences in its collagenic tail (11Deprez P.N. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11043-110469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Asymmetric AChE forms have a high binding affinity for BL components, particularly HSPGs (12Vigny M. Martin G.R. Grotendorst G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8794-8798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which are themselves major constituents of basement membranes (13Bayne E.K. Anderson M.J. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1486-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Inestrosa N.C. Fernandez H.L. Nerve-Muscle Cell Trophic Communication. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: 147-172Google Scholar). Heparin and heparan sulfate have also been shown to release asymmetric AChE activity from rat muscle end plate regions (15Torres J.C. Inestrosa N.C. FEBS Lett. 1983; 154: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and BL sheets purified from the electric organ of Discopyge (16Brandan E. Maldonado M. Garrido J. Inestrosa N.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The demonstration that A12 could bind and be selectively eluted from heparin-agarose columns, whereas non-collagenous forms and A12 after collagenase treatment could not, proved the direct interaction of A12 with heparin in vitro(11Deprez P.N. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11043-110469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Brandan E. Inestrosa N.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Direct interactions with heparin/heparan sulfate moietiesin vivo have also been demonstrated. Asymmetric AChE forms were shown to bind the surface of HSPG-rich cells, such as mouse myotubes and CHO-KI cells, in a saturable and time-dependent manner, whereas pretreatment of these cells with heparitinase almost abolished this binding. In addition, the binding of A12 AChE was reduced by 80% in Chinese hamster ovary clone 606, a mutant expressing undersulfated HSPGs (10Inestrosa N.C. Gordon H. Esko J.D. Hall Z.W. Shafferman A. Velan B. Multidisciplinary Approaches to Cholinesterase Functions. Plenum Press, New York1992: 51-58Google Scholar). Similarly, purified BL sheets from electric organ were found to release only asymmetric AChE forms when treated with heparitinase but not chondroitinase ABC (16Brandan E. Maldonado M. Garrido J. Inestrosa N.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Finally, the assumption that HSPGs were likely involved in the intracellular assembly, transport, and cell surface deposition of asymmetric AChE is supported by the finding that a mutant variant of rat PC12 neuronal cells lacking HSPGs expressed a predominantly internal distribution of asymmetric AChE in contrast to normal PC12 cells in which almost all asymmetric AChE was extracellular (18Inestrosa N.C. Reiness G.C. Reichardt L.F. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1981; 1: 1260-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Inestrosa N.C. Matthew W.D. Reiness C.G. Hall Z.W. Reichardt L.F. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting the notion that asymmetric AChE forms are associated with the BL through electrostatic bonds, it was recently suggested that the enzyme displaced by high ionic strength and heparin buffers was in fact non-junctional and originated in intracellular compartments (20Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19152-19159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1979-1987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In quail muscle fibers and myotube cultures, these ionic buffers did not disaggregate previously formed surface AChE clusters, as detected by immunofluorescence techniques; however, the presence of heparin impeded their formation. Hence the authors formulated the hypothesis that only the newly secreted pool of asymmetric AChE was capable of binding heparin, as a transient event prior to its permanent, covalent association with the BL (21Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1979-1987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our aims were to study the solubilization properties of junctional AChE first by quantifying the extraction capacity of high salt- and heparin-containing buffers, and second by evaluating the effect of these buffers on the AChE activity associated with BL-enriched preparations derived from rat muscle end plate regions and Torpedo californica electric organ. Our results strongly suggest that both high salt and heparin buffers solubilize a major portion of extracellular collagen-tailed AChE and demonstrate the capacity of these buffers to dissolve AChE-rich regions from neuromuscular junctions, as detected by histochemical staining. The tissues used were frozen samples of T. californica electric organ, obtained from Pacific Bio-Marine (Venice, CA), and end plate regions of rat diaphragm muscle. The latter were obtained from anesthetized female Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by removing the diaphragm muscles together with the surrounding ribs and dissecting 2-mm strips of end plate regions (1 mm on either side of the phrenic nerve) (2Hall Z.W. J. Neurobiol. 1973; 4: 343-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 15Torres J.C. Inestrosa N.C. FEBS Lett. 1983; 154: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The end plate strips were maintained in ice-cold saline solution (0.9% NaCl). The tissues were then homogenized for 5 min using a glass-to-glass homogenizer at full speed, in 1:10 (w/v) detergent buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 100 mmcaproic acid, 5 mm EDTA) (22Inestrosa N.C. Fuentes M.E. Anglister L. Futerman A.H. Silman I. Neurosci. Lett. 1988; 90: 185-190Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 25 min in a fixed rotor using a Kubota KR-20000T centrifuge. The supernatants were then removed and assayed for activity, and the pellets were resuspended and rehomogenized as above. This wash cycle was repeated a total of 5 times, removing the majority of AChE globular forms and yielding a fibrous BL-enriched preparation for both rat muscle end plate tissue and Torpedoelectric organ (23Sanes J.R. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Inestrosa N.C. Méndez B. Cell. Biochem. & Funct. 1983; 1: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Aliquots were taken from the initial tissue homogenates for activity assays and from the BL-enriched preparations for activity and histochemical analyses. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) was used as a quantitative marker for intracellular contamination of the BL-enriched preparations, before and after undergoing extractions. LDH activity was measured using the Promega kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the percentage of remnant activity was calculated from the activity measured in the initial tissue homogenates (100%). Sialyltransferase activity, a marker of the Golgi apparatus (25Perelman A. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C. Inestrosa N.C. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used in some experiments to assess the presence of Golgi vesicles, and therefore intracellular contaminants, in our BL fractions. The BL-enriched preparations were divided into 3 groups, and duplicate samples for each group were homogenized for 5 min in 1:10 (w/v) of one of the following buffers: control buffer, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing several protease inhibitors (as above); heparin extraction buffer, 1 mg/ml heparin in control buffer; or high salt extraction buffer, 1 m NaCl in control buffer. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 25 min and the supernatants removed, and the extraction procedure was repeated. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Aliquots were taken from the extraction supernatants for activity assays and sedimentation analyses. The post-extraction pellets were kept at 4 °C for subsequent histochemical studies and collagenase digestion. Adult rat diaphragm muscle was dissected and cut into thin strips, pinned, and perfused for 1 h with high salt borate extraction buffer, in the presence or absence of heparin, as described by Rossi and Rotundo (20Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19152-19159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the muscle fibers were incubated with the histochemical reaction buffer of Karnovsky and Roots (26Karnovsky M.J. Roots L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). In addition, the AChE activity released by these buffers was assayed in parallel experiments. The molecular forms of AChE present in the tissue homogenates and BL-enriched fractions, and those solubilized from the latter, were resolved by sedimentation analysis on 5–20% linear sucrose gradients, as described previously (6Inestrosa N.C. Silberstein L. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1982; 29: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Inestrosa N.C. Miller J.B. Silberstein L. Ziskind-Conhaim L. Hall Z.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 147: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To release all the molecular forms present in the homogenate samples, initial homogenates and BL preparations were homogenized in detergent buffer containing 1 m NaCl for the purpose of sedimentation analysis. AChE activity was measured by the method of Ellman et al. (28Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21721) Google Scholar). All incubations were carried out at 37 °C for rat muscle samples and 25 °C forTorpedo electric organ, in a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.3 mm dithionitrobenzoic acid, and 0.75 mmacetylthiocholine iodide. 10 mm tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide (iso-OMPA) was also included as a specific inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase activity. Absorbance was read at 412 nm in a Shimadzu UV-150–02 double-beam spectrophotometer. Collagenase digestions were carried out as described by Younkin et al. (29Younkin S.G. Rosenstein C. Collins P.L. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13630-13637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to quantitatively determine the AChE activity extracted from the BL preparations as a function of the total AChE present. In short, the BL pellets were incubated following either control, high salt, or heparin extractions, at 25 °C for 4 h with 0.1 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma, type V) in 1:10 (w/v) of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm benzamidine, 10 mm CaCl2 but devoid of EDTA. The reaction was stopped when the samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were finally assayed for AChE activity. Rat muscle end plate honeycomb ghost preparations were obtained using a method similar to that of Sanes and Hall (23Sanes J.R. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), omitting the salt extraction step. End plate regions were dissected as before from diaphragm muscles and were maintained in ice-cold saline solution (0.9% NaCl) before being thinly cut into transverse sections and washed twice for 1 h with detergent buffer as follows: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. The end plate strips were then divided into three groups and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:25 (w/v) of detergent buffer alone, detergent buffer containing 1 m NaCl, or detergent buffer plus 1 mg/ml heparin. The resultant honeycomb ghosts were then analyzed for residual AChE activity by histochemical staining, and solubilized AChE activity was also assayed in the preparation buffers. AChE activity was detected by histochemical staining in the BL-enriched fractions of both rat muscle end plates and Torpedo electric organ, in the semi-intact perfused rat muscle fibers and in the rat muscle end plate honeycomb ghost preparations, before and after their particular extractions. For this, the method of Karnovsky and Roots (26Karnovsky M.J. Roots L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar) was employed, using 2.2 mg/ml acetylthiocholine iodide, 0.71 m malate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.1m sodium citrate, 30 mm copper sulfate, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 3% neutral formol. All incubations were carried out at 4 °C, and all samples were processed simultaneously to make their staining intensities comparable. In the case of the BL-enriched preparations, samples weighed ∼3 mg. For the honeycomb ghosts, multiple section samples were stained for each group. All samples were incubated for 20 min with iso-OMPA (10 mm), prior to the histochemical reaction, to inhibit butyrylcholinesterase activity. Control samples were incubated with 10 mm iso-OMPA plus either 50 mm methanesulfonyl fluoride or 10 μm BW 284c51 dibromide to inhibit cholinesterase activity or specifically AChE activity, respectively. Samples were then viewed under the phase-contrast light microscope. Affinity chromatography using an acridine-agarose column was used to purify the collagen-tailed form of AChE, as described previously (30Lee S.L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12292-12301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both specific activity (4,000 units/mg protein) and staining intensities following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (a single band of 67 kDa) were used to verify purity. Sucrose sedimentation analysis was subsequently used to confirm that the purified protein corresponded to the asymmetric A12 form of AChE. Rat muscle primary cultures were prepared from the hindlimb muscles of an 18-day-old rat embryo and were maintained as described by Koenig (31Koenig J. Biol. Cell. 1979; 35: 147-152Google Scholar). Approximately 3 × 105 cells were plated onto 35-mm plastic tissue culture dishes coated with gelatin. The myoblasts reached confluence 24 h after plating, and the onset of fusion and large myotube formation began at 48 h. Most of the myotubes presented spontaneous contractile activity around the 5th day in culture. The medium was then removed, and the myotubes were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1m NaCl and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The myotubes were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 milliunits of AChE enzyme, purified from Torpedo electric organ, in the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml heparin. The cells were then washed twice with 2:5 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 2 mg/ml heparin. The cell surface-associated AChE activity solubilized by this medium was then assayed. For the determination of total cell surface-bound AChE, an additional incubation with the same medium containing 1 m NaCl instead of heparin was performed. Since it was recently reported that neither high salt- nor heparin-containing buffers detached asymmetric collagen-tailed forms of AChE from the BL of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (20Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19152-19159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1979-1987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we wanted to re-evaluate the solubilization properties of the asymmetric forms present in BL-enriched preparations, derived from both diaphragm muscle end plates as well as Torpedo electric organ. Several homogenization-centrifugation cycles in the presence of Triton X-100 detergent were used to remove most of the hydrophobic and soluble proteins and yield BL-enriched preparations for both tissues. The AChE forms present in these BL-rich fractions were compared with those present in the corresponding initial homogenates by velocity sedimentation analysis (Fig. 1). Characteristic sedimentation profiles were obtained for both rat diaphragm (Fig. 1 A) and Torpedo electric organ (Fig. 1 B) homogenates, including asymmetric (A12 and A8) as well as globular forms (G1 and G4 for rat and G2 for Torpedo). In contrast, the asymmetric AChE forms were greatly enriched in the BL preparations as seen by the absence of the peaks corresponding to the globular forms. When the Torpedo BL preparations were examined under the electron microscope, the typical cytoarchitecture of Torpedo basement membranes was apparent and predominant (Fig. 2). The presence of asymmetric AChE associated with these BL sheets was an important confirmation that the enzyme was in fact anchored to such extracellular structures.Figure 2Basal lamina sheets are the major constituents of the extracellular matrix material purified from Torpedo electric organ.

The sample was fixed in Karnovsky's fixative, post-fixed, stained with uranyl acetate, and finally prepared for electron microscopy.

First, LDH activity was used as an indicator of remnant-soluble cytoplasmic material. After repeated Triton X-100 extractions, some residual LDH activity (∼6% of the total) was detectable in the final rat muscle end plate BL-enriched preparation (Fig. 3). Furthermore, two subsequent extraction steps with either high salt or heparin solubilized half of this remnant activity (see inset of Fig. 3), indicating that a residual intracellular material was probably trapped within or retained electrostatically by the BL sheets. Similar results were obtained for Torpedo electric organ preparations. These results indicate that asymmetric AChE is not trapped in vesicles as a soluble entity. Second, the absence of sialyltransferase activity, a Golgi marker, in both the rat and Torpedo BL-enriched preparations (data not shown), makes it unlikely that intracellular asymmetric AChE remained associated, as a contaminant, to the BL fractions used in these studies. Having identified the source of collagen-tailed AChE as predominantly BL, a study of the solubilization properties of these forms was carried out at short extraction times. First, samples of purified BL material were submitted to two 5-min homogenization-centrifugation cycles with either high salt- or heparin-containing buffers. Both AChE activity and the molecular forms solubilized were then determined. As Fig.4 shows, only asymmetric forms of AChE were released by either high salt or heparin from both rat (Fig.4 A) and Torpedo (Fig. 4 B) BL preparations. Additional experiments were carried out using sectioned rat muscle end plates treated with detergent so as to generate honeycomb ghost preparations (23Sanes J.R. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with structurally integral junctional regions. The AChE activity released by the high salt- or heparin-containing buffers used for the ghost preparation was assayed; heparin was able to solubilize 50% of that released by NaCl (data not shown). Similarly, in rat muscle end plate BL, heparin extracted approximately 40% of the activity solubilized by high salt, as shown in Fig. 5 A, whereas in Torpedo electric organ, both buffers solubilized similar quantities (80–90%) of asymmetric AChE (Fig. 5 B). The total fraction of asymmetric AChE solubilized by heparin was much greater in Torpedo electric organ than in rat muscle end plate regions (80% compared with 30%) (TableI), suggesting that a larger population of heparin-extractable asymmetric AChE exists in the former. When high salt and heparin-containing buffers were used to perfuse rat diaphragm muscle strips for 1 h, no AChE activity was detectable in the activity assays carried out on these buffers (data not shown).Figure 5AChE activity released from the rat and Torpedo BL-enriched fractions by ionic extractions and collagenase treatment. Rat (A) and Torpedo(B) BL preparations were submitted to control and ionic extractions, as described earlier, using Tris-HCl (10 mm), heparin (1 mg/ml), or NaCl (1 m) buffers (white bars). Following centrifugation, the BL pellets were treated with collagenase (Sigma type V) for 4 h at 25 °C to solubilize the remnant AChE activity resistant to extraction (gray bars).

Sanes J.R. Marshall L.M. Nature. 1978; 271: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In rat diaphragm and gracilis muscles, most of the asymmetric AChE activity is extracellular, of which only 15–25% is considered to be a non-extractable fraction (29Younkin S.G. Rosenstein C. Collins P.L. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13630-13637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Fernandez H.L. Inestrosa N.C. Stiles J.R. Neurochem. Res. 1984; 9: 1213-1229Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, a recent report suggested that all junctional asymmetric AChE formed part of this non-extractable pool, given that high salt and heparin buffers seemed unable to disrupt or diminish the number of cell-surface AChE clusters in quail myotube cells or end plate regions of avian muscles (20Rossi S.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1979-1987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore in the present study, we sought to quantify the extractable as well as the non-extractable fraction of BL-associated AChE activity and ascertain whether a change in the quantity and distribution in extracellular AChE-rich regions could be detected following high salt or heparin extractions. First, collagenase digestion after high salt extractions indicated that the non-extractable pool of asymmetric AChE in rat end plate regions accounted for 23% of the total BL-associated asymmetric AChE (Fig.5 A, see also Table I), in agreement with Younkin et al. (29Younkin S.G. Rosenstein C. Collins P.L. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13630-13637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in Torpedo electric organ, a minor portion of junctional AChE remained after high salt or heparin extractions, accounting for 9% of non-extractable enzyme (Fig.5 B). Second, AChE activity was visualized by histochemical staining before and after extractions on the BL-enriched fractions obtained from rat and Torpedo tissues. In the former, the morphological appearance, size, and organization of the histochemically stained structures seen in Fig. 6 revealed the presence of numerous isolated and well preserved motor end plates with their synaptic gutters. These neuromuscular junctions, rich in AChE activity, were also clearly visible in the rat muscle BL fractions prior to high salt and heparin extractions (Fig.7 A). Following high salt treatment, most of the activity in these end plates disappeared (Fig.7 B). Heparin extractions also produced a reduction in the size and staining intensities of the end plates detected (Fig.7 C). Control experiments in the presence of inhibitors specific for AChE did not show end plate hydrolytic activity (Fig.7 D). Histochemistry carried out on the BL sheets purified from Torpedo electric organ demonstrated that these samples contained isolated surfaces highly enriched in AChE activity (Fig.8 A). On the other hand, the same preparations treated with either high salt (Fig. 8 B) or heparin (Fig. 8 C) showed only minimal residual AChE activity in both cases. Controls treated with AChE inhibitors showed no activity (Fig. 8 D). In the experiments usin"
