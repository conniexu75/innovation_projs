https://openalex.org/W2991547863,"Caloric restriction has been associated with increased life span and reduced aging-related disorders and reduces fibrosis in several diseases. Fibrosis is characterized by deposition of excess fibrous material in tissues and organs and is caused by aging, chronic stress, injury, or disease. Myofibroblasts are fibroblast-like cells that secrete high levels of extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in fibrosis. Histological studies have identified many-fold increases of myofibroblasts in aged organs where myofibroblasts are constantly generated from resident tissue fibroblasts and other cell types. However, it remains unclear how aging increases the generation of myofibroblasts. Here, using mouse models and biochemical assays, we show that sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) deficiency plays a major role in aging-associated transformation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, resulting in tissue fibrosis. Our findings suggest that SIRT6-deficient fibroblasts transform spontaneously to myofibroblasts through hyperactivation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling in a cell-autonomous manner. Importantly, we noted that SIRT6 haploinsufficiency is sufficient for enhancing myofibroblast generation, leading to multiorgan fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction in mice during aging. Mechanistically, SIRT6 bound to and repressed the expression of key TGF-β signaling genes by deacetylating SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) and Lys-9 and Lys-56 in histone 3. SIRT6 binding to the promoters of genes in the TGF-β signaling pathway decreased significantly with age and was accompanied by increased binding of SMAD3 to these promoters. Our findings reveal that SIRT6 may be a potential candidate for modulating TGF-β signaling to reduce multiorgan fibrosis during aging and fibrosis-associated diseases.

Calorie restriction has been suggested as a strategy to increase life span and reduce aging-related disorders, including heart failure (1Ravussin E. Redman L.M. Rochon J. Das S.K. Fontana L.

Calorie restriction is believed to activate sirtuins, a family of class III histone deacetylase proteins (5Chalkiadaki A. Guarente L. The multifaceted functions of sirtuins in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15 (26383140): 608-62410.1038/nrc3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Sirtuins remove acetyl moieties from target Lys residues, thereby regulating the function of targets including histone and nonhistone proteins. There are seven sirtuin isoforms in humans, which are distributed in different subcellular compartments (5Chalkiadaki A. Guarente L. The multifaceted functions of sirtuins in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15 (26383140): 608-62410.1038/nrc3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Among the seven isoforms, SIRT6 is chromatin-associated and deacetylates histone 3 at Lys-9, Lys-18, and Lys-56 (5Chalkiadaki A. Guarente L. The multifaceted functions of sirtuins in cancer.Nat. Rev.

In addition, SIRT6 regulates the activity of proteins by post-translational modifications, such as deacetylation, ADP-ribosylation, and demyristoylation. SIRT6 is also known to repress transcription factors HIF-1α, NF-κB, c-Myc, and c-Jun (5Chalkiadaki A. Guarente L. The multifaceted functions of sirtuins in cancer.Nat. Rev.

Interestingly, SIRT6 deficiency induces accelerated aging in mice, whereas overexpression extends lifespan in male mice (9Kanfi Y. Naiman S. Amir G. Peshti V. Zinman G. Nahum L. Bar-Joseph Z.

Recent reports indicate that SIRT6 activation prevents several aging-related diseases, including metabolic diseases, cancer, and inflammation (5Chalkiadaki A. Guarente L.

One of the major contributors of tissue fibrosis is activation of TGF-β 7The abbreviations used are: TGF-β1transforming growth factor β1TARETGF-β/activin-response elementα-SMAα-smooth muscle actinH3K9 and H3K56histone H3 Lys-9 and Lys-56, respectivelyIGFinsulin-like growth factorqPCRquantitative PCRSBESMAD3-binding element(s)Col1a and Col3acollagen 1a and 3a, respectivelyFN1fibronectin 1HPRThypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseHRPhorseradish peroxidaseANOVAanalysis of varianceKOknockoutp-SMAD3phosphorylated SMAD3WCLwhole-cell lysate(s)CBPCREB-binding protein. signaling (12Edgley A.J.

The TGF-β superfamily consists of three ligands, TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3, which are synthesized as latent precursors. Activated TGF-β1 binds to membrane receptors and initiates a series of phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascades, which finally culminate into activation of SMAD family of transcription factors (13Heldin C.H.

Activation of TGF-β is essential for proper embryogenesis, organ morphogenesis, cell polarity, and wound healing (13Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Moreover, the mRNA levels of different regulators of the TGF-β pathway, including TGFβRI, TGFβRII, SMAD3, and SMAD4 are significantly higher in senescent fibroblasts derived from old human donors compared with those from young donors (25Rapisarda V.

Based on several experimental studies, inhibition of TGF-β signaling was suggested to be a therapeutic target for the treatment of pathologic fibrosis (26Edgley A.J. Krum H. Kelly D.J.

It is worth mentioning that neutralization of TGF-β by specific antibodies was considered to be one of the strategies for curing fibrotic diseases (27Laurent G.J. Coker R.K. McAnulty R.J.

However, TGF-β signaling inhibitors failed in clinical trials as anti-fibrotic drugs owing to severe adverse effects probably because of cross-talk between multiple signaling pathways (18Meng X.M. Nikolic-Paterson D.J. Lan H.Y. TGF-β: the master regulator of fibrosis.Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2016; 12 (27108839): 325-33810.1038/nrneph.2016.48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 26Edgley A.J.

Our previous findings indicate that activation of SIRT6 specifically in cardiomyocytes prevents the development of pressure overload–induced cardiac hypertrophy by repressing IGF/Akt signaling (8Sundaresan N.R.

Khan D. Ahamed F. Mishra S. Giri M. Inbaraj M. Krishna S. Sarikhani M. Maity S. Kumar S. Shah R.A. Dave P. Pandit A.S. Rajendran R. et al.SIRT6 transcriptionally regulates global protein synthesis through transcription factor Sp1 independent of its deacetylase activity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 (31372634): 9115-913110.1093/nar/gkz648Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated the role of SIRT6 in regulating TGF-β signaling and development of multiorgan fibrosis during aging using in vitro cell culture and mouse models. Our data suggest that SIRT6 transcriptionally regulates TGF-β signaling pathway genes, thus functioning as guardian to protect against adverse tissue remodeling during aging. SIRT6-deficient mice develop accelerated aging and aging-associated diseases, such as heart failure, metabolic syndrome, and inflammation (7Tasselli L. Zheng W. Chua K.F. SIRT6: novel mechanisms and links to aging and disease.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2017; 28 (27836583): 168-18510.1016/j.tem.2016.10.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In our previous work, we observed increased fibrosis in the hearts of SIRT6-deficient mice (8Sundaresan N.R. Vasudevan P. Zhong L. Kim G. Samant S. Parekh V. Pillai V.B. Ravindra P.V. Gupta M. Jeevanandam V. Cunningham J.M. Deng C.-X. Lombard D.B. Mostoslavsky R. Gupta M.P. The sirtuin SIRT6 blocks IGF-Akt signaling and development of cardiac hypertrophy by targeting c-Jun.Nat. Med. 2012; 18 (23086477): 1643-165010.1038/nm.2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Because TGF-β signaling is a well-established driver of fibrosis (17Leask A. Abraham D.J. TGF-β signaling and the fibrotic response.FASEB J. 2004; 18 (15117886): 816-82710.1096/fj.03-1273revCrossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar, 18Meng X.M. Nikolic-Paterson D.J. Lan H.Y. TGF-β: the master regulator of fibrosis.Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2016; 12 (27108839): 325-33810.1038/nrneph.2016.48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar), we tested TGF-β signaling in various organs of SIRT6−/− mice and cardiac fibroblasts isolated from SIRT6−/− mice. Western blot analysis of kidney, heart, lung, and the liver tissues of SIRT6-deficient mice revealed increased phosphorylation of SMAD3, suggesting activated TGF-β signaling (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). Further, we observed a marked up-regulation of TGF-β1 and TGFβRI protein levels in these tissues (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). To further validate our findings, we assessed the TGF-β signaling in SIRT6-deficient cardiac fibroblasts. Consistent with in vivo findings, we observed increased phosphorylation of SMAD3 and enhanced levels of TGF-β1 in SIRT6-deficient cardiac fibroblasts, indicating activation of TGF-β signaling as shown in Fig. 1B. Further, to rule out any confounding effects due to genomic instability and age-related degeneration observed in SIRT6−/− mice, we transiently depleted SIRT6 using SIRT6-specific siRNA in cardiac fibroblasts isolated from WT mice and assessed the activation of TGF-β signaling. We observed that depletion of SIRT6 spontaneously activated TGF-β signaling, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of SMAD3 and the enhanced expression levels of TGF-β1 and TGFβRI (Fig. 1C). However, we did not see any marked changes in the expression of SMAD1 in SIRT6-depleted cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). Next, we checked whether SB-505124, a TGF-β signaling pathway inhibitor treatment, reduces spontaneous activation of TGF-β signaling in SIRT6-depleted fibroblasts. SB-505124 treatment indeed significantly reduced the activity of TGF-β signaling in control and SIRT6-depleted fibroblasts as measured by the TGF-β/activin-response element (TARE)-containing luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. 1D). In addition, we performed luciferase reporter assays to test the transcriptional activity of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) promoter, a well-characterized fibrosis-associated gene activated by TGF-β signaling. Notably, SIRT6-depleted cells showed increased luciferase reporter activity for the α-SMA promoter, which was attenuated by SB-505124 treatment (Fig. 1E). In line with this, inhibition of TGF-β signaling markedly reduced the phosphorylation of SMAD3 and the protein levels of TGF-β1 and TGFβRI levels in SIRT6-depleted fibroblasts (Fig. 1 (F and G) and Fig. S1B). These findings suggest that hyperactivation of TGF-β signaling might be a contributing factor for the increased protein levels of TGF-β1 and TGFβRI levels in SIRT6-depleted fibroblasts, and there could be a positive feedback loop in the activation of TGF-β signaling in SIRT6-deficient cells. Because SIRT6-deficient mice show enhanced TGF-β signaling due to increased TGF-β1 and TGFβRI levels, we tested serum TGF-β1 levels by sandwich ELISA. Surprisingly, our results suggest that TGF-β1 levels were not increased in the serum of SIRT6+/− mice (Fig. 1H), which could possibly be due to failure in detectable levels of serum TGF-β1, because TGF-β1 works mostly as a paracrine growth factor (32Khan S.A. Joyce J. Tsuda T. Quantification of active and total transforming growth factor-β levels in serum and solid organ tissues by bioassay.BMC Res. Notes. 2012; 5 (23151377): 63610.1186/1756-0500-5-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because SIRT6 deficiency spontaneously activates TGF-β signaling, we tested the effect of transient overexpression of SIRT6 on TGF-β signaling. Overexpression of SIRT6-WT, but not SIRT6-H133Y or SIRT6-S56Y, the catalytic mutants of SIRT6, attenuated TGF-β signaling (Fig. 2A). Further immunostaining results suggest that SIRT6 overexpression attenuates the basal and TGF-β1–induced phosphorylation of SMAD3 in cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 2 (B and C) and Fig. S1C). Consistent with our observations, TARE reporter activity was inhibited by overexpression of SIRT6. Moreover, expression of SIRT6-H133Y or SIRT6-S56Y markedly enhanced the TARE reporter activity over basal levels, indicating a dominant negative effect of these mutants. Interestingly, SB-505124 treatment reduced the enhanced TGF-β signaling in SIRT6-H133Y– and SIRT6-S56Y–expressing cells (Fig. 2D). In addition, we observed similar results with the promoter activity of α-SMA (Fig. 2E). These findings suggest that the catalytic activity of SIRT6 is required for the inhibition of TGF-β signaling, and the hyperactivation of TGF-β signaling might be a contributing factor for the enhanced SMAD3 activity. Recent studies have shown association of H3K9 acetylation with myofibroblasts differentiation and extracellular matrix accumulation in nasal polyposis (33Cho J.S. Moon Y.M. Park I.H. Um J.Y.

SIRT6 is a chromatin-associated histone deacetylase known to transcriptionally regulate IGF/Akt signaling by regulating acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 (8Sundaresan N.R. Vasudevan P. Zhong L. Kim G. Samant S. Parekh V. Pillai V.B. Ravindra P.V. Gupta M. Jeevanandam V. Cunningham J.M. Deng C.-X. Lombard D.B. Mostoslavsky R. Gupta M.P. The sirtuin SIRT6 blocks IGF-Akt signaling and development of cardiac hypertrophy by targeting c-Jun.Nat. Med. 2012; 18 (23086477): 1643-165010.1038/nm.2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that SIRT6 could transcriptionally modulate the expression of TGF-β signaling genes. To test this hypothesis, we quantified mRNA levels of key TGF-β signaling genes by real-time qPCR in SIRT6−/− mouse hearts. The mRNA levels of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGFβRI, and TGFβRII were significantly up-regulated (Fig. 3A). However, we did not observe significant changes in mRNA levels of TGF-β3 and SMAD3 in SIRT6−/− mouse hearts (Fig. 3A). These results are consistent with an increase in protein levels of TGF-β1 and TGFβRI (Fig. 1, A–C). On the other hand, mRNA levels of TGF-β1, TGFβRI, and TGFβRII were significantly down-regulated in SIRT6-overexpressing cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts (Fig. 3, B and C). To test whether increased protein and mRNA levels of TGF-β1 in SIRT6-depleted cells are associated with increased transcriptional activation, we performed luciferase reporter assays with the construct containing the promoter region of TGF-β1. Our results suggest that SIRT6 deficiency increased TGF-β1 promoter activity, which was significantly inhibited following treatment with SB-505124 (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, transient overexpression of SIRT6, but not SIRT6-H133Y or SIRT6-S56Y, repressed the activity of TGF-β1 promoter (Fig. 3E). Further, expression of SIRT6-H133Y and SIRT6-S56Y markedly enhanced the TGF-β1 promoter reporter activity over basal levels, suggesting that inhibition of SIRT6 by dominant negative SIRT6-H133Y or SIRT6-S56Y activates TGF-β1 promoter activity (Fig. 3E). These findings reveal that SIRT6 might transcriptionally control expression of TGF-β signaling genes. We next tested whether SIRT6 binds to the promoters of TGF-β signaling genes by ChIP and found that SIRT6 binds significantly to TGF-β1, TGFBRI, TGFBRII, and SMAD3 promoters in cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 3F). Similarly, we found significant enrichment of SIRT6 at the promoters of TGF-β signaling genes in fibroblasts (Fig. S2A). Further, for the validation of anti-SIRT6 antibody used for ChIP, we tested the occupancy of SIRT6 at the TGF-β1 gene promotor in control and SIRT6-depleted cells. We find that SIRT6 displays significant binding only in control cells and not in SIRT6-depleted cells (Fig. S2B), indicating the specificity of the antibody. Therefore, these data suggest that SIRT6 might regulate TGF-β signaling by binding to the promoters of TGF-β signaling genes. Because SIRT6 is known to deacetylate histone 3 at Lys-9 and Lys-56 and control gene expression at the chromatin level (5Chalkiadaki A. Guarente L.

Biol. 2016; 23 (27043296): 434-44010.1038/nsmb.3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we tested the levels of acetylated H3K9 and H3K56 on promoters of TGF-β signaling genes. We found increased acetylated H3K9 and H3K56 at the promoters of TGF-β1, TGFβRI, TGFβRII, and SMAD3 genes in SIRT6-depleted cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 3, G and H). Similarly, we observed increased H3K9 acetylation at the promoters of TGF-β signaling genes in SIRT6-depleted 293T fibroblasts (Fig. S2C). These data demonstrate that SIRT6 may repress the expression of key TGF-β signaling genes by deacetylating H3K9 and H3K56. Collectively, our findings suggest that SIRT6 transcriptionally regulates expression of key TGF-β signaling pathway genes through deacetylation of histone 3 at Lys-9 and Lys-56. We performed in silico analysis of TGF-β signaling genes to find the transcription factors that could be targeted by SIRT6. We identified conserved binding sites for SMAD3 in the promoters of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGFBRI, TGFBRII, and SMAD3, but not in TGF-β3 (File S1). Earlier studies indicate that autocrine TGF-β/SMAD3 transcription factor signal is necessary for TGF-β1 expression in dendritic cells (34Kashiwagi I. Morita R. Schichita T. Komai K. Saeki K. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Nomura M. Hayashi A. Kanai T. Yoshimura A.

Thus, we hypothesized that SIRT6 might regulate SMAD3 transcription factor to control TGF-β signaling genes. SMAD3 has been shown to be an acetylated protein (35Inoue Y. Itoh Y. Abe K. Okamoto T. Daitoku H. Fukamizu A. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. Smad3 is acetylated by p300/CBP to regulate its transactivation activity.Oncogene. 2007; 26 (16862174): 500-50810.1038/sj.onc.1209826Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and SIRT6 deacetylates proteins such as PKM2 (36Bhardwaj A. Das S. SIRT6 deacetylates PKM2 to suppress its nuclear localization and oncogenic functions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We immunoprecipitated SMAD3 from SIRT6−/− mouse hearts and found increased acetylation of SMAD3 (Fig. 4A). In addition, SIRT6 was found to interact with both endogenous as well as ectopically overexpressed SMAD3 (Fig. 4, B–D). Further, we tested whether catalytic activity of SIRT6 plays a role in SMAD3 deacetylation. Our data suggest that SMAD3 can be deacetylated by SIRT6-WT, but not SIRT6-H133Y (Fig. 4E). Further"

This study was conducted to answer the following questions. Does open innovation create organisation's competitive advantage? What types of capabilities are needed in the process of open innovation reaching competitive advantage, and what kind of relationship do they have? This study extends the scope of theoretical discussion about open innovation from the point of dynamic capability view. The results confirmed the statistical significance of the path linking open innovation to competitive advantage through product innovation. From the viewpoint of capabilities, transforming capability plays a role of significant prerequisite of sensing capability and seizing capability, having a direct or indirect significant effect on product innovation performance and competitive advantage sequentially. The results suggest that the linkages between the needed capabilities of organisation must be considered for performing open innovation to secure competitive advantage."
https://openalex.org/W2989731286,"In the US Carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is primarily attributed to the presence of the genes blaKPC-2 and blaKPC-3, which are transmitted via plasmids. Carbapenem-resistant Kp (CR-Kp) infections are associated with hospital outbreaks. They are difficult to treat, and associated with high mortality rates prompting studies of how resistance is obtained. In this study, we determined the presence of CRISPR-Cas in 304 clinical Kp strains. The CRISPR-Cas system has been found to prevent the spread of plasmids and bacteriophages, and therefore limits the horizontal gene transfer mediated by these mobile genetic elements. Here, we hypothesized that only those Kp strains that lack CRISPR-Cas can acquire CR plasmids, while those strains that have CRISPR-Cas are protected from gaining these plasmids and thus maintain sensitivity to antimicrobials. Our results show that CRISPR-Cas is absent in most clinical Kp strains including the clinically important ST258 clone. ST258 strains that continue to be sensitive to carbapenems also lack CRISPR-Cas. Interestingly, CRISPR-Cas positive strains, all non-ST258, exhibit lower resistance rates to antimicrobials than CRISPR-Cas negative strains. Importantly, we demonstrate that the presence of CRISPR-Cas appears to inhibit the acquisition of blaKPC plasmids in 7 Kp strains. Furthermore, we show that strains that are unable to acquire blaKPC plasmids contain CRISPR spacer sequences highly identical to those found in previously published multidrug-resistance-containing plasmids. Lastly, to our knowledge this is the first paper demonstrating that resistance to blaKPC plasmid invasion in a CRISPR-containing Kp strain can be reversed by deleting the CRISPR-cas cassette."
https://openalex.org/W2991501294,"Advances in digital technology have led to large amounts of personal data being recorded and retained by industry, constituting an invaluable asset to private organizations. The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, including the UK, fundamentally reshaped how data is handled across every sector. It enables the general public to access data collected about them by organisations, opening up the possibility of this data being used for research that benefits the public themselves; for example, to uncover lifestyle causes of poor health outcomes. A significant barrier for using this commercial data for academic research, however, is the lack of publicly acceptable research frameworks. Data donation—the act of an individual actively consenting to donate their personal data for research—could enable the use of commercial data for the benefit of society. However, it is not clear which motives, if any, would drive people to donate their personal data for this purpose. In this paper we present the results of a large-scale survey (N = 1,300) that studied intentions and reasons to donate personal data. We found that over half of individuals are willing to donate their personal data for research that could benefit the wider general public. We identified three distinct reasons to donate personal data: an opportunity to achieve self-benefit, social duty, and the need to understand the purpose of data donation. We developed a questionnaire to measure those three reasons and provided further evidence on the validity of the scales. Our results demonstrate that these reasons predict people’s intentions to donate personal data over and above generic altruistic motives. We show that a social duty is the strongest predictor of the intention to donate personal data, while understanding the purpose of data donation also positively predicts the intentions to donate personal data. In contrast, self-serving motives show a negative association with intentions to donate personal data. The findings presented here examine people’s reasons for data donation to help inform the ethical use of commercially collected personal data for academic research for public good."

The objective of current-study is to examine this-issue.Study-population included 239singleton pregnant-women(gestational-age[GA] at delivery: 21.6~36weeks) who had inflammation in extraplacental membranes or chorionic plate (CP) and either preterm-labor or preterm-PROM. We examined FIR, and the frequency of fetal inflammatory-responses syndrome(FIRS), proven-EONS, suspected-EONS and chorioamnionitis according to the progression of inflammation in UC. The progression of inflammation in UC was divided with a slight-modification from previously reported-criteria as follows: stage0, inflammation-free UC; stage-1: umbilical phlebitis only; stage-2: involvement of at least one UA and either the other UA or UV without extension into WJ; stage-3: the extension of inflammation into WJ. FIR was gauged by umbilical-cord-plasma(UCP) CRP concentration(ng/ml) at birth, and FIRS was defined as an elevated UCP CRP concentration at birth(≥200ng/ml).Stage-0, stage-1, stage-2 and stage-3 of inflammation in UC were present in 48.1%, 15.5%, 6.7%, and 29.7% of cases. FIR continuously increased according to the progression of inflammation in UC(Kruskal-Wallis test,P<0.001; Spearman-rank-correlation test,P<0.000001,r = 0.546). Moreover, there was a significant and stepwise increase in the frequency of FIRS, proven-EONS, suspected-EONS and chorioamnionitis according to the progression of inflammation in UC(each for P<0.000005 in both chi-square test and linear-by-linear-association). Multiple logistic-regression analysis demonstrated that the more advanced-stage in the progression of inflammation in UC(i.e., stage-1 vs. stage-2 vs. stage-3), the better predictor of suspected-EONS (Odds-ratio[OR]3.358, 95%confidence-interval[CI]:1.020-11.057 vs. OR5.147, 95%CI:1.189-22.275 vs. OR11.040, 95%CI:4.118-29.592) and chorioamnionitis(OR6.593, 95%CI:2.717-15.999 vs. OR16.508, 95%CI:3.916-69.596 vs. OR20.167, 95%CI:8.629-47.137).FIR, EONS and chorioamnionitis continuously increase according to the progression of inflammation in UC among preterm-gestations with inflammation in extraplacental membranes or CP. This finding may suggest that funisitis(inflammation in UC) is both qualitatively and quantitatively histologic-counterpart of FIRS, and a surrogate-marker for chorioamnionitis."
https://openalex.org/W2989917205,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a therapy recalcitrant disease characterized by the aberrations in multiple genes that drive pathogenesis and limit therapeutic response. While CDK4/6 represents a downstream target of both KRAS mutation and loss of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor in PDAC, clinical and preclinical studies indicate that pharmacological CDK4/6 inhibitors are only modestly effective. Since chemotherapy represents the established backbone of PDAC treatment we evaluated the interaction of CDK4/6 inhibitors with gemcitabine and taxanes that are employed in the treatment of PDAC. Herein, we demonstrate that the difference in mechanisms of actions of chemotherapeutic agents elicit distinct effects on the cellular response to CDK4/6 inhibition. Gemcitabine largely ablates the function of CDK4/6 inhibition in S-phase arrested cells when administered contemporaneously; although, when cells recover from S-phase block they exhibit sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of CDK4/6 yields a cooperative cytostatic effect in combination with docetaxel and prevents adaptation and cell cycle re-entry, which is a common basis for resistance to such agents. Importantly, using organoid and PDX models we could confirm the cooperative effects between chemotherapy and CDK4/6 inhibition in vivo. These data indicate that the combination of cytotoxic and cytostatic agents could represent an important modality in those tumor types that are relatively resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2991572372,"Background Since the start of organ transplantation, hypothermia-forced hypometabolism has been the cornerstone in organ preservation. Cold preservation showed to protect against ischemia, although post-transplant injury still occurs and further improvement in preservation techniques is needed. We hypothesize that hydrogen sulphide can be used as such a new preservation method, by inducing a reversible hypometabolic state in human sized kidneys during normothermic machine perfusion. Methods Porcine kidneys were connected to an ex-vivo isolated, oxygen supplemented, normothermic blood perfusion set-up. Experimental kidneys (n = 5) received a 85mg NaHS infusion of 100 ppm and were compared to controls (n = 5). As a reflection of the cellular metabolism, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial activity and tissue ATP levels were measured. Kidney function was assessed by creatinine clearance and fractional excretion of sodium. To rule out potential structural and functional deterioration, kidneys were studied for biochemical markers and histology. Results Hydrogen sulphide strongly decreased oxygen consumption by 61%, which was associated with a marked decrease in mitochondrial activity/function, without directly affecting ATP levels. Renal biological markers, renal function and histology did not change after hydrogen sulphide treatment. Conclusion In conclusion, we showed that hydrogen sulphide can induce a controllable hypometabolic state in a human sized organ, without damaging the organ itself and could thereby be a promising therapeutic alternative for cold preservation under normothermic conditions in renal transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2991584852,"In recent years, the prevalence and infection intensity of Schistosoma japonicum in endemic areas of the Philippines have significantly decreased due to yearly population-based treatment strategies, yet transmission rates remain high and uninterrupted. An important indicator of active disease transmission is the presence of Schistosoma japonicum and its snail intermediate host Oncomelania hupensis quadrasi in freshwater habitats. In this study, we sought to apply a species-specific real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for the detection of S. japonicum and O. hupensis quadrasi in freshwater samples using environmental DNA approach that can complement the commonly utilized malacological survey in determining potential transmission foci in order to have a more effective snail surveillance strategy for schistosomiasis japonica in endemic areas. The newly developed assay was specific to S. japonicum and O. hupensis quadrasi with no amplification detected against non-target trematode Fasciola spp. and snails such as Lymnaea spp., Pomacea canaliculata, and Melanoides spp. that typically co-exist in the same environment. The assay effectiveness was determined using 19 environmental water samples collected from Northern Samar (N = 5 sites), Leyte (N = 11 sites) and Compostela Valley (N = 3 sites) and compared to malacological survey for determining O. hupensis quadrasi snail colonies and snail crushing to visualize S. japonicum cercariae. TaqMan qPCR targeting a short fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene was positive for S. japonicum in 9 sites, for O. hupensis quadrasi in 9 sites, and for both S. japonicum and O. hupensis quadrasi in 5 sampling sites. Moreover, it was able to detect O. hupensis quadrasi in 3 out of 12 sites found negative and 6 out of 7 sites found positive through malacological survey, and in 4 of the 5 snail sites positive for snails with cercariae. Overall, this method can complement malacological surveys for monitoring of schistosomes in endemic areas of the Philippines, especially those with high risk of human infection."
https://openalex.org/W2989771971,"The introduction of imatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as first-line standard therapy in patients with unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent gastro-intestinal stromal tumor (GIST), strongly improved their treatment outcomes. However, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended for this drug due to the large inter-individual variability in plasma concentration when standard dose is administered. A Cmin higher than 760 ng/mL was associated with a longer progression free survival. Thus, a LC-MS/MS method has been developed and fully validated to quantify imatinib and its active metabolite, norimatinib, in finger-prick dried blood spot (DBS). The influence of hematocrit, sample homogeneity, and spot size and the correlation between finger-prick and venous DBS measurements were also assessed. The method showed a good linearity (R2 > 0,996) between 50-7500 ng/mL for imatinib and 10-1500 ng/mL for norimatinib. Analytes were extracted from DBS samples by simply adding to 3 mm-discs 150 μL of acidified methanol containing IMA-D8. The collected extract was then injected on a LC Nexera system in-house configured for the on-line cleanup, coupled with an API-4000 QT. The chromatographic separation was conducted on a Synergi Fusion-RP column (4 μm, 2x50 mm) while the trapping column was a POROS R1/20 (20 μm, 2x30 mm). The total run time was 8.5 min. DBSs stored at room temperature in plastic envelopes containing a silica-gel drying bag were stable up to 16 months. The proposed method was applied to 67 clinical samples, showing a good correlation between patients' finger-prick DBS and plasma concentrations, measured by the reference LC-MS/MS method, internally validated. Imatinib and norimatinib concentrations found in finger-prick DBS were adjusted by hematocrit or by an experimental correction factor to estimate the corresponding plasma measurements. At the best of our knowledge, the proposed LC-MS/MS method is the first analytical assay to measure imatinib and norimatinib in DBS samples."
https://openalex.org/W2990459127,"Myosin VI is involved in many cellular processes ranging from endocytosis to transcription. This multifunctional potential is achieved through alternative isoform splicing and through interactions of myosin VI with a diverse network of binding partners. However, the interplay between these two modes of regulation remains unexplored. To this end, we compared two different binding partners and their interactions with myosin VI by exploring the kinetic properties of recombinant proteins and their distribution in mammalian cells using fluorescence imaging. We found that selectivity for these binding partners is achieved through a high-affinity motif and a low-affinity motif within myosin VI. These two motifs allow competition among partners for myosin VI. Exploring how this competition affects the activity of nuclear myosin VI, we demonstrate the impact of a concentration-driven interaction with the low-affinity binding partner DAB2, finding that this interaction blocks the ability of nuclear myosin VI to bind DNA and its transcriptional activity in vitro We conclude that loss of DAB2, a tumor suppressor, may enhance myosin VI-mediated transcription. We propose that the frequent loss of specific myosin VI partner proteins during the onset of cancer leads to a higher level of nuclear myosin VI activity."

Multimorbidity was defined as the presence of two or more chronic diseases in the same individual, while complex multimorbidity was classified as the occurrence of three or more chronic conditions affecting three or more body systems. Socio-demographic data, occupational contact with pesticides, lifestyle data and clinical condition data were collected through a structured questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for multimorbidity.The prevalence of multimorbidity among farmers was 41.5% (n = 328), and complex multimorbidity was 16.7% (n = 132). More than 77% of farmers had at least one chronic illness. Hypertension, dyslipidemia and depression were the most prevalent morbidities. Being 40 years or older (OR 3.33, 95% CI 2.06-5.39), previous medical diagnosis of pesticide poisoning (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.03-3.44), high waist circumference (OR 2.82, CI 95% 1.98-4.02) and worse health self-assessment (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.52-2.91) significantly increased the chances of multimorbidity. The same associations were found for the diagnosis of complex multimorbidity.We identified a high prevalence of multimorbidity and complex multimorbidity among the evaluated farmers. These results were associated with increased age, abdominal fat, pesticide poisoning, and poor or fair health self-assessment. Public policies are necessary to prevent, control and treat this condition in this population."

NDRG1 silencing without Dp44mT and DpC up-regulated c-Met expression, demonstrating that NDRG1 modulates c-Met levels. Dp44mT and DpC up-regulated NDRG1 by an iron-dependent mechanism and decreased c-Met levels, c-Met phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of its downstream effector, GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1).

Considering the crucial role c-Met plays in cancer, it is vital to target this molecule for effective management of malignant tumors, particularly drug-resistant cancers. The regulation of c-Met expression is complex, with the protein being reported to be processed by internalization, endocytosis, and lysosomal degradation (10Lefebvre J. Ancot F. Leroy C. Muharram G. Lemière A. Tulasne D. Met degradation: more than one stone to shoot a receptor down.FASEB J. 2012; 26 (22223753): 1387-139910.1096/fj.11-197723Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but also via the proteasomal pathway (11Jeffers M. Taylor G.A. Weidner K.M. Omura S. Vande Woude G.F. Degradation of the Met tyrosine kinase receptor by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17 (9001234): 799-80810.1128/MCB.17.2.799Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been suggested that membrane-bound metalloproteinases of the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family (12Edwards D.R. Handsley M.M. Pennington C.J. The ADAM metalloproteinases.Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29 (18762209): 258-28910.1016/j.mam.2008.08.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) could be involved in c-Met degradation at the extracellular level (13Murphy G. The ADAMs: signalling scissors in the tumour microenvironment.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8 (19005493): 929-94110.1038/nrc2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This is because these proteases are major mediators of cell-surface protein shedding during tumor progression, which interferes with intracellular signaling (13Murphy G. The ADAMs: signalling scissors in the tumour microenvironment.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8 (19005493): 929-94110.1038/nrc2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In fact, ADAM10 is the protease regulating spontaneous c-Met shedding, as its knockdown leads to increased cell-surface levels of c-Met in vitro (14Kopitz C. Gerg M. Bandapalli O.R. Ister D. Pennington C.J. Hauser S. Flechsig C. Krell H.W. Antolovic D. Brew K. Nagase H. Stangl M. von Weyhern C.W. Brücher B.L.

ADAM17 has also been proposed as another mediator involved in shedding (15Foveau B. Ancot F. Leroy C. Petrelli A. Reiss K. Vingtdeux V. Giordano S. Fafeur V. Tulasne D. Down-regulation of the met receptor tyrosine kinase by presenilin-dependent regulated intramembrane proteolysis.Mol. Biol.

Additionally, c-Met has been recently been described to be cleaved by metalloproteases both intracellularly (e.g. in lysosomes) and also at the extracellular level at the plasma membrane by metalloproteases (e.g. ADAM10, ADAM17, etc.), leading to the generation of a C-terminal fragment (CTF) (14Kopitz C.

A putative metastasis suppressor, N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 (NDRG1), is an important molecular target of the DpT class of agents (20Whitnall M. Howard J. Ponka P. Richardson D.R.

Therefore, we initially aimed to examine whether NDRG1 affects c-Met expression in these latter cancer types and the molecular nature of the effect.

Furthermore, silencing NDRG1 in cancer cells significantly increased c-Met protein expression and phosphorylation, but it did not inhibit the chelator-mediated down-regulation of c-Met. Three lysosomotropic agents, which interrupt lysosomal degradation, significantly inhibited the ability of the chelators to decrease c-Met levels, suggesting the role of lysosomal processing.

However, no increase in extracellular shedding of c-Met was observed after incubation with Dp44mT, suggesting a role for intracellular shedding and lysosomal degradation. The initial aim of this investigation was to examine the effect of NDRG1 silencing on c-Met expression in cancer cells. To elucidate these aims, the NDRG1 gene was silenced in c-Met-expressing DU145 and Huh7 cells using siNDRG1 and compared with the nontargeting, negative control siRNA (siControl). Then, cells were either incubated in media alone or media containing HGF (50 ng/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, which induces c-Met phosphorylation (41Xu K.P. Yu F.S. Cross-talk between c-Met and epidermal growth factor receptor during retinal pigment epithelial wound healing.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Protein levels of c-Met and its phosphorylated forms were then examined using Western blotting (Fig. 1, B–E). First, in DU145 cells, upon silencing NDRG1, NDRG1 protein levels were significantly reduced relative to the siControl in the presence or absence of HGF (Fig. 1, B and Ci). Two major bands were detected for NDRG1 protein at 41 and 46 kDa in DU145 cells, as reported previously (42Ghalayini M.K. Dong Q. Richardson D.R. Assinder S.J.

The 170-kDa band represents the single-chain c-Met precursor, whereas the ∼140-kDa band corresponds to the β-subunit of the mature 190-kDa c-Met protein (45Giordano S. Di Renzo M.F. Narsimhan R.P.

Most social science research in the field of text analytics relies on English language corpora, biasing our ability to understand international phenomena. To address the issue of corpus selection bias, we introduce results that suggest that machine translation may be used to address non-English sources. We use human translation and machine translation (Google Translate) on a collection of aligned sentences from United Nations documents extracted from the Multi-UN corpus, analyzed with a ""bag of words"" analysis tool, Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC). Overall, the LIWC indices proved relatively stable across machine and human translated sentences. We find that while there are statistically significant differences between the original and translated documents, the effect sizes are relatively small, especially when looking at psychological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2990248875,"We have previously characterized an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) chemotherapy model for SCID-based immune deficient mice (NSG and NSGS), consisting of 5 days of cytarabine (AraC) and 3 days of anthracycline (doxorubicin), to simulate the standard 7+3 chemotherapy regimen many AML patients receive. While this model remains tractable, there are several limitations, presumably due to the constitutional Pkrdcscid (SCID, severe combined immune deficiency) mutation which affects DNA repair in all tissues of the mouse. These include the inability to combine preconditioning with subsequent chemotherapy, the inability to repeat chemotherapy cycles, and the increased sensitivity of the host hematopoietic cells to genotoxic stress. Here we attempt to address these drawbacks through the use of alternative strains with RAG-based immune deficiency (NRG and NRGS). We find that RAG-based mice tolerate a busulfan preconditioning regimen in combination with either AML or 4-drug acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) chemotherapy, expanding the number of samples that can be studied. RAG-based mice also tolerate multiple cycles of therapy, thereby allowing for more aggressive, realistic modeling. Furthermore, standard AML therapy in RAG mice was 3.8-fold more specific for AML cells, relative to SCID mice, demonstrating an improved therapeutic window for genotoxic agents. We conclude that RAG-based mice should be the new standard for preclinical evaluation of therapeutic strategies involving genotoxic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2990993241,"Objective Clinical practice universally assumes that appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy improves survival in patients with bloodstream infection. However, this is not generally supported by previous studies. We examined the association between appropriate therapy and 30-day mortality, while minimizing bias due to confounding by indication. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study between 2012 and 2017 at a tertiary university hospital in the Netherlands. Adult patients with bloodstream infection attending the emergency department were included. Based on in vitro susceptibility, antibiotic therapy was scored as appropriate or inappropriate. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. To control for confounding, we performed conventional multivariable logistic regression and propensity score methods. Additionally, we performed an analysis in a more homogeneous subgroup (i.e. antibiotic monotherapy). Results We included 1.039 patients, 729 (70.2%) received appropriate therapy. Overall 30-day mortality was 10.4%. Appropriately treated patients had more unfavorable characteristics, indicating more severe illness. Despite adjustments, we found no association between appropriate therapy and mortality. For the antibiotic monotherapy subgroup (n = 449), patient characteristics were more homogeneous. Within this subgroup, appropriate therapy was associated with lower mortality (Odds Ratios [95% Confidence Intervals] ranging from: 0.31 [0.14; 0.67] to 0.40 [0.19; 0.85]). Conclusions Comparing heterogeneous treatment groups distorts associations despite use of common methods to prevent bias. Consequently, conclusions of such observational studies should be interpreted with care. If possible, future investigators should use our method of attempting to identify and analyze the most homogeneous treatment groups nested within their study objective, because this minimizes residual confounding."
https://openalex.org/W2991132126,"Background In 2016, very high rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-ST398 (99%) were found in Portuguese pig farms that used colistin, amoxicillin, and zinc oxide as feed additives. Since then, farms A and B banned the use of colistin, and farm C banned the use of both antibiotics. Objective The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the ban of colistin and amoxicillin on pig MRSA carriage rates, clonal types and antimicrobial resistance, compared to the results obtained in 2016. Methods In 2018, 103 pigs (52 from farm B using amoxicillin only as a feed additive and 51 from farm C where no antibiotics were included in the feed regimen) were nasally swabbed for MRSA colonization. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, and characterised by spa typing, SCCmec typing and MLST. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed for representative isolates. Results Overall, 96% of the pigs swabbed in 2018 carried MRSA, mostly ST398-SCCmec V-spa types t011/t108. MRSA from pigs not receiving antibiotics in the feed regimen showed susceptibility to a higher number of antibiotics, namely erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol. Notably, most of these isolates (n = 52) presented an unusual erythromycin-susceptibility/clindamycin-resistance phenotype. WGS showed that these isolates lacked the erm and the lnu genes encoding resistance to macrolides and lincosamides, respectively, but carried the vgaALC gene encoding resistance to lincosamides, which is here firstly identified in S. aureus ST398. Conclusion After two years the ban of colistin and amoxicillin as feed additives had no significant impact on the MRSA nasal carriage rates. Nevertheless, the MRSA strains circulating in those farms showed resistance to a lower number of antibiotic classes."

We sought to identify prognostic factors affecting LSCC outcomes in our population. Methods Clinical characteristics, treatments and survival outcomes of patients with LSCC were analysed. Baseline comorbidity data was collected and age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (aCCI) was calculated. Outcomes of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and laryngectomy-free survival (LFS) were evaluated. Results Two hundred and fifteen patients were included, 170 (79%) underwent primary radiation/ chemoradiation and the remainder upfront surgery with adjuvant therapy where indicated. The majority of patients were male, Chinese and current/ex-smokers. Presence of comorbidity was common with median aCCI of 3. Median OS was 5.8 years. On multivariable analyses, high aCCI and advanced nodal status were associated with inferior OS (HR 1.24 per one point increase in aCCI, P<0.001 and HR 3.52; p<0.001 respectively), inferior PFS (HR 1.14; p = 0.007 and HR 3.23; p<0.001 respectively) and poorer LFS (HR 1.19; p = 0.001 and HR 2.95; p<0.001 respectively). Higher tumor (T) stage was associated with inferior OS and LFS (HR 1.61; p = 0.02 and HR 1.91; p = 0.01 respectively). Conclusion In our Asian population, the presence of comorbidities and high nodal status were associated with inferior OS, PFS and LFS whilst high T stage was associated with inferior LFS and OS."

A nationwide, population-based cohort study was conducted using data from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. From 2001 to 2010, participants with newly diagnosed pSS were recognized as the study group. In addition, a comparison cohort of non-pSS participants was matched for age, gender, and initial diagnosis date. Risks of developing OAB and BPS/IC in pSS patients of different age, sex, and various therapeutic strategies were calculated. Hazard ratios (HR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard model. In total, 11,526 pSS patients were recognized. The HRs of OAB and BPS/IC in pSS patients were 1.68 (95% C.I.: 1.48–1.91, p<0.01) and 2.34 (95% C.I.: 1.59–3.44, p<0.01), respectively. The risks of OAB and BPS/IC were significantly increased for pSS patients aged < 65 years (HR: 1.73 and 2.67), female patients (HR: 1.74 and 2.34), and patients requiring treatment for dry eyes and dry mouth (HR: 2.06 and 2.93). pSS patients exhibited an increased risk of OAB and BPS/IC.

https://openalex.org/W2989707237,"MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) is a new minimally invasive treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), with limited effectiveness data. It is unknown if the cost savings associated with shorter hospitalization could offset the high equipment cost of MRgLITT. We examined the cost-utility of MRgLITT versus surgery for TLE from healthcare payer perspective, and the value of additional research to inform policy decision on MRgLITT.We developed a microsimulation model to evaluate quality adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MRgLITT versus surgery in TLE, assuming life-time horizon and 1.5% discount rate. Model inputs were derived from the literature. We conducted threshold and sensitivity analyses to examine parameter uncertainties, and expected value of partial perfect information analyses to evaluate the expected monetary benefit of eliminating uncertainty on probabilities associated with MRgLITT.MRgLITT yielded 0.08 more QALYs and cost $7,821 higher than surgery, with ICER of $94,350/QALY. Influential parameters that could change model outcomes include probabilities of becoming seizure-free from disabling seizures state and returning to disabling seizures from seizure-free state 5 years after surgery and MRgLITT, cost of MRgLITT disposable equipment, and utilities of disabling seizures and seizure-free states of surgery and MRgLITT. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed surgery was preferred in more than 50% of iterations. The expected monetary benefit of eliminating uncertainty for probabilities associated with MRgLITT was higher than for utilities associated with MRgLITT.MRgLITT resulted in more QALYs gained and higher costs compared to surgery in the base-case. The model was sensitive to variations in the cost of MRgLITT disposable equipment. There is value in conducting more research to reduce uncertainty on the probabilities and utilities of MRgLITT, but priority should be given to research focusing on improving the precision of estimates on effectiveness of MRgLITT."
https://openalex.org/W2990067963,"The aims of this study were to 1) evaluate the impact of eight common chronic conditions and multimorbidity on preference-based health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and 2) estimate the minimally important difference (MID) in the general population of Hong Kong (HK).Data were analyzed using secondary data analysis based on a cross-sectional, population-based validation study of HK's general population.A representative sample was recruited across eighteen geographical districts in HK, and 1,014 HK Chinese residents aged 18 years and older participated in the survey. The prevalence of chronic conditions among the respondents was 30.3%.The HRQoL was assessed using the locally validated version of EQ-5D-5L. The five-dimension descriptive system, and the utility scores of EQ-5D-5L were used as the dependent variable in the study. Eight common chronic conditions, multimorbidity, and demographic characteristics were defined as predictors in the analysis. Chi-squared test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), logistic regression, and Tobit regression models were used to analyze the data. A simulation-based approach was used to calculate the MID based on instrument-defined single level transitions.The findings indicated that respondents with physical disabilities were more likely to report problems on all five dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L than those with other chronic conditions. In addition, respondents with multiple chronic conditions were more likely to report health problems and lower utility scores of EQ-5D-5L. The mean of MID estimates among the respondents in HK was 0.093 (standard deviation = 0.001), which is higher than in other Asian countries.The findings suggest that having more chronic conditions is strongly associated with a lower HRQoL. Healthcare reforms to address foreseeable challenges arising as more patients live with chronic conditions and multimorbidity could improve the HRQoL of HK citizens."

This study aimed to identify the changes in the proportions of Th subsets, including Th17.1, which are associated with abatacept treatment response in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis. On the basis of the results, we assessed whether Th17.1 is a potential cellular biomarker. Multicolor flow cytometry was used to determine the circulating Th subsets among CD4+ T lymphocytes in 40 patients with rheumatoid arthritis before abatacept treatment. All the patients received abatacept treatment for 24 weeks; changes in disease activity score, including 28-joint count C-reactive protein, and responsiveness indicated by other indices to abatacept treatment were evaluated according the European League Against Rheumatism criteria (good and moderate responders and nonresponders). The correlation between the abatacept responses and the proportions of Th subsets (baseline) was analyzed. Logistic regression analysis with inverse probability weighting method was performed to calculate the odds ratio adjusted for patient characteristics. The proportion of baseline Th17.1 cells was significantly lower in patients categorized as good responders than in those categorized as non-good responders (moderate responders and nonresponders; p = 0.0064). The decrease in 28-joint count C-reactive protein after 24 weeks of abatacept therapy showed a significant negative correlation with the proportion of Th17.1 cells. The adjusted odds ratio for achieving good response in patients with baseline Th17.1 levels below the median value was 14.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.9-72.3; p = 0.0021) relative to that in the remaining patients. The proportion of Th17.1 cells at baseline is a good candidate for predicting abatacept treatment response in Japanese patients. These novel findings may represent a significant step in the pursuit of precision medicine."

The evidence for whether weight loss following longer-term lifestyle interventions results in improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is inconclusive. This study examines whether women who lose weight after completing an 18-month web-based lifestyle modification intervention would report a corresponding improvement in HRQoL as measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-item profile (PROMIS-29 v1.0).


Methods 
Data from 216 rural women, ages 40 to 69, with baseline and 18-month PROMIS-29 data were analyzed in this secondary analysis of the Women Weigh-in for Wellness clinical trial. This trial promoted lifestyle modification for initial weight loss (baseline to 6 months) and guided weight loss (6 months to 18 months) using a web-delivery format.


Results 
After adjusting for age, number of comorbidities, change in physical activity from baseline, intervention group, and baseline PROMIS-29 scores, change in weight was associated with improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the domains of depression, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, and satisfaction with social role. Logistic regressions, adjusting for the same factors, indicated women with ≥ 10% weight loss were more likely to report lower depression, higher physical function and less pain interference, compared to women who gained weight or lost < 5%.


Conclusions 
Among our rural women, a loss in weight from baseline appeared to be associated with overall improvement in multiple PROMIS-29 v 1.0 domains, noting the likelihood of achieving improvement was significantly higher among women who attained ≥ 10% weight loss. These findings may positively influence a woman’s adherence to lifestyle modification weight loss and weight maintenance program.

https://openalex.org/W2990316487,"In interior Eurasia, high mountain zones are crucial to pastoral subsistence, providing seasonally productive pastures and abundant wild resources. In some areas of northern Mongolia, mountainous tundra zones also support a low-latitude population of domestic reindeer herders-a lifestyle whose origins are poorly characterized in the archaeological record of early Mongolia. Traditionally, reindeer pastoralists make significant seasonal use of munkh mus (eternal ice) for their domestic herds, using these features to cool heat-stressed animals and provide respite from insect harassment. In recent years, many of these features have begun to melt entirely for the first time, producing urgent threats to traditional management techniques, the viability of summer pastures, and reindeer health. The melting ice is also exposing fragile organic archaeological materials that had previously been contained in the patch. We present the results of horseback survey of ice patches in Baruun Taiga special protected area, providing the first archaeological insights from the region. Results reveal new evidence of historic tool production and wild resource use for fishing or other activities, and indicate that ice patches are likely to contain one of the few material records of premodern domestic reindeer use in Mongolia and lower Central Asia. The area's ancient ice appears to be rapidly melting due to changing climate and warming summer temperatures, putting both cultural heritage and traditional reindeer herding at extreme risk in the years to come."

Sphingolipids are signaling molecules involved in regulating cell functions and have been associated with multiple genetic disease processes. African-Americans are more likely to suffer from SLE morbidity than Whites. The Medical University of South Carolina has banked plasma samples from a well-characterized lupus cohort that includes African-Americans and Whites. This study examined the influence of race on plasma sphingolipid profiles in SLE patients and association of sphingolipid levels with comorbid atherosclerosis and SLE disease activity. Mass spectrometry revealed that healthy African-Americans had higher sphingomyelin levels and lower lactosylcermide levels compared to healthy Whites. SLE patients, irrespective of race, had higher levels of ceramides, and sphingoid bases (sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine) and their phosphates compared to healthy subjects. Compared to African-American controls, African-American SLE patients had higher levels of ceramides, hexosylceramides, sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate. Compared to White controls, White SLE patients exhibited higher levels of sphingoid bases and their phosphates, but lower ratios of C16:0 ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate and C24:1 ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate. White SLE patients with atherosclerosis exhibited lower levels of sphingoid bases compared to White SLE patients without atherosclerosis. In contrast, African-American SLE patients with atherosclerosis had higher levels of sphingoid bases and sphingomyelins compared to African-American SLE patients without atherosclerosis. Compared to White SLE patients with atherosclerosis, African-American SLE patients with atherosclerosis had higher levels of select sphingolipids. Plasma levels of sphingosine, C16:0 ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate ratio and C24:1 ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate ratio significantly correlated with SLEDAI in the African-American but not White SLE patients. The C16:0 ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate ratio in SLE patients, and levels of C18:1 and C26:1 lactosylcermides, C20:0 hexosylceramide, and sphingoid bases in SLE patients with atherosclerosis could be dependent on race. Further ethnic studies in SLE cohorts are necessary to verify use of sphingolipidomics as complementary diagnostic tool."

Many genes act jointly to influence PH throughout development. To map the quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling PH, we used the unconditional variable method (UVM) and conditional variable method (CVM) to analyze PH data for a four-way recombinant inbred line (FW-RIL) population derived from the cross of (Kenfeng14 × Kenfeng15) × (Heinong48 × Kenfeng19). We identified 7, 8, 16, 19, 15, 27, 17, 27, 22, and 24 QTL associated with PH at 10 developmental stages, respectively. These QTL mapped to 95 genomic regions. Among these QTL, 9 were detected using UVM and CVM, and 89 and 66 were only detected by UVM or CVM, respectively. In total, 36 QTL controlling PH were detected at multiple developmental stages and these made unequal contributions to genetic variation throughout development. Among 19 novel regions discovered in our study, 7 could explain over 10% of the phenotypic variation and contained only one single QTL. The unconditional and conditional QTL detected here could be used in molecular design breeding across the whole developmental procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2990644237,"We estimate the effects of Peru’s oldest watershed payments for environmental services (PES) initiative in Moyobamba (Andes–Amazon transition zone) and disentangle the complex intervention into its two main forest conservation treatments. First, a state-managed protected area (PA) was established, allowing sustainable use but drastically limiting de facto land use and land rights of households in the upper watershed through command-and-control interventions. Second, a subset of those environmentally regulated households also received incentives: PES-like voluntary contracts with conditional in-kind rewards, combined with access to participation in sustainable income-generating activities of the integrated conservation and development project (ICDP) type. To evaluate impacts, we perform matching procedures and adjustment regressions to obtain the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) of each intervention. We investigate impacts on plot-level forest cover and household welfare for the period 2010–2016. We find that both treatments—command-and-control restrictions and the incentive package—modestly but significantly mitigated primary forest loss. Incentive-induced conservation gains came at elevated per-hectare implementation costs. We also find positive effects on incentive-treated households’ incomes and assets; however, their self-perceived wellbeing counterintuitively declined. We hypothesise that locally frustrated beneficiary expectations vis-a-vis the ambitiously designed PES-cum-ICDP intervention help explain this surprising finding. We finalise with some recommendations for watershed incentives and policy mix design in Moyobamba and beyond."

The induction of miR-200c expression seems to effect a rapid reduction of cell motility, as determined by 1D microlane migration assays. Sustained expression of miR200c leads to a changed morphology and reveals a novel mechanism by which miR-200c interferes with cytoskeletal components. We find that filamin A expression is attenuated by miRNA-200c induced downregulation of the transcription factors c-Jun and MRTF/SRF. This potentially novel pathway that is independent of the prominent ZEB axis could lead to a broader understanding of the role that miR200c plays in cancer metastasis."

However, little is known about the predictive factors for long-term outcome. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease eXcluding INR (MELD-XI) score was originally developed to assess cirrhotic patients and has the prognostic value for heart failure (HF) patients. In the present study, we examined whether the score also has the prognostic value in this population. We retrospectively examined 637 ACHD patients (mean age 31.0 years) who visited our Tohoku University hospital from 1995 to 2015. MELD-XI score was calculated as follows; 11.76 x ln(serum creatinine) + 5.11 x ln(serum total bilirubin) + 9.44. We compared the long-term outcomes between the high (≥10.4) and the low (<10.4) score groups. The cutoff value of MELD-XI score was determined based on the survival classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. The major adverse cardiac event (MACE) was defined as a composite of cardiac death, HF hospitalization, and lethal ventricular arrhythmias. During a mean follow-up period of 8.6 years (interquartile range 4.4-11.4 years), MACE was noted in 51 patients, including HF hospitalization in 37, cardiac death in 8, and lethal ventricular arrhythmias in 6. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the high score group had significantly worse MACE-free survival compared with the low score group (log-rank, P<0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that the MELD-XI score remained a significant predictor of MACE (hazard ratio 1.36, confidence interval 1.17-1.58, P<0.001) even after adjusting for patient characteristics, such as sex, functional status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and cardiac function. Furthermore, CART analysis revealed that the MELD-XI score was the most important variable for predicting MACE. These results demonstrate that the MELD-XI score can effectively predict MACE in ACHD patients, indicating that ACHD patients with high MELD-XI score need to be closely followed."

RNase BN levels decrease in stationary-phase cells, leading to elevation of 6S RNA and subsequent regulation of RNA polymerase. These findings were the first indication that RNase BN itself is growth phase–regulated. Here, we analyze the mechanism of this regulation of RNase BN.

We measured the participants' tendency to cooperate with the robot as well as their perception of anthropomorphism, trust and credibility through questionnaires. We found that cooperation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) follows the same rule of Human-Human Interaction (HHI), participants rewarded cooperation with cooperation, and punished selfishness with selfishness. We also discovered two specific robotic profiles capable of increasing cooperation, related to the payoff. A mute and non-interactive robot is preferred with a high payoff, while participants preferred a more human-behaving robot in conditions of low payoff. Taken together, these results suggest that proper cooperation in HRI is possible but is related to the complexity of the task."
https://openalex.org/W2991401438,"Lethal control is widely employed to suppress the numbers of target wildlife species within restricted management areas. The success of such measures is expected to vary with local circumstances affecting rates of removal and replacement. There is a need both to evaluate success in individual cases and to understand variability and its causes. In Britain, red fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations are culled within the confines of shooting estates to benefit game and wildlife prey species. We developed a Bayesian state-space model for within-year fox population dynamics within such restricted areas and fitted it to data on culling effort and success obtained from gamekeepers on 22 shooting estates of 2 to 36 km2. We used informative priors for key population processes—immigration, cub recruitment and non-culling mortality–that could not be quantified in the field. Using simulated datasets we showed that the model reliably estimated fox density and demographic parameters, and we showed that conclusions drawn from real data were robust to alternative model assumptions. All estates achieved suppression of the fox population, with pre-breeding fox density on average 47% (range 20%–90%) of estimated carrying capacity. As expected, the number of foxes killed was a poor indicator of effectiveness. Estimated rates of immigration were variable among estates, but in most cases indicated rapid replacement of culled foxes so that intensive culling efforts were required to maintain low fox densities. Due to this short-term impact, control effort focussed on the spring and summer period may be essential to achieve management goals for prey species. During the critical March-July breeding period, mean fox densities on all estates were suppressed below carrying capacity, and some maintained consistently low fox densities throughout this period. A similar model will be useful in other situations to quantify the effectiveness of lethal control on restricted areas."

The cross-sectional areas of individual trunk and gluteus muscles relative to body mass were significantly larger in the long jumpers than in untrained men (P < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.3–4.3) except for the gluteus medius and minimus. The relative cross-sectional area of the rectus abdominis of takeoff leg side was significantly correlated with their personal best record for the long jump (r = 0.674, corrected P = 0.004). Stepwise multiple regression analysis selected relative cross-sectional areas of the rectus abdominis and iliacus and the personal best record in 100-m sprint to predict the long jump distance (standard error of estimate = 22.6 cm, adjusted R2 = 0.763). The results of the multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the rectus abdominis and iliacus size were associated with long jump performance independently of sprint running capacity, suggesting the importance of these muscles in achieving high performance in the long jump."
https://openalex.org/W2990327316,"Objective Active surveillance (AS) is an increasingly utilized strategy for monitoring men with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) that allows them to defer active treatment (AT) in the absence of cancer progression. Studies have explored reasons for selecting AS and for then switching to AT, but less is known about men’s experiences being on AS. We interviewed men to determine the clinical and psychological factors associated with selecting and adhering to AS protocols. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with men with a low-risk PCa at two academic medical centers. Subjects had either been on AS for ≥ 1 year or had opted for AT after a period of AS. We used an iterative, content-driven approach to analyze the interviews and to identify themes. Results We enrolled 21 subjects, mean age 70.4 years, 3 racial/ethnic minorities, and 16 still on AS. Men recognized the favorable prognosis of their cancer (some had sought second opinions when initially offered AT), valued avoiding treatment complications, were reassured that close monitoring would identify progression early enough to be successfully treated, and trusted their urologists. Although men reported feeling anxious around the time of surveillance testing, those who switched to AT did so based only on evidence of cancer progression. Conclusions Our selected sample was comfortable being on AS because they understood and valued the rationale for this approach. However, this highlights the importance of ensuring that men newly diagnosed with a low-risk PCa are provided sufficient information about prognosis and treatment options to make informed decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2991568194,"HER2 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, which plays a key role in breast cancer due to a common genomic amplification. It is used as a marker to stratify patients in the clinic and is targeted by a number of drugs including Trastuzumab and Lapatinib. HER2 has previously been shown to translocate to the nucleus. In this study, we have explored the properties of nuclear HER2 by analysing the binding of this protein to the chromatin in two breast cancer cell lines. We find genome-wide re-programming of HER2 binding after treatment with the growth factor EGF and have identified a de novo motif at HER2 binding sites. Over 2,000 HER2 binding sites are found in both breast cancer cell lines after EGF treatment, and according to pathway analysis, these binding sites were enriched near genes involved in protein kinase activity and signal transduction. HER2 was shown to co-localise at a small subset of regions demarcated by H3K4me1, a hallmark of functional enhancer elements and HER2/H3K4me1 co-bound regions were enriched near EGF regulated genes providing evidence for their functional role as regulatory elements. A chromatin bound role for HER2 was verified by independent methods, including Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA), which confirmed a close association between HER2 and H3K4me1. Mass spectrometry analysis of the chromatin bound HER2 complex identified EGFR and STAT3 as interacting partners in the nucleus. These findings reveal a global role for HER2 as a chromatin-associated factor that binds to enhancer elements to elicit direct gene expression events in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2991594482,"The restricted access of regulatory factors to their binding sites on DNA wrapped around the nucleosomes is generally interpreted in terms of molecular shielding exerted by nucleosomal structure and internucleosomal interactions. Binding of proteins to DNA often includes intercalation of hydrophobic amino acids into the DNA. To assess the role of constrained superhelicity in limiting these interactions, we studied the binding of small molecule intercalators to chromatin in close to native conditions by laser scanning cytometry. We demonstrate that the nucleosome-constrained superhelical configuration of DNA is the main barrier to intercalation. As a result, intercalating compounds are virtually excluded from the nucleosome-occupied regions of the chromatin. Binding of intercalators to extranucleosomal regions is limited to a smaller degree, in line with the existence of net supercoiling in the regions comprising linker and nucleosome free DNA. Its relaxation by inducing as few as a single nick per ~50 kb increases intercalation in the entire chromatin loop, demonstrating the possibility for long-distance effects of regulatory potential."

https://openalex.org/W2990328639,"Background The burden of musculoskeletal trauma is growing worldwide, disproportionately affecting low-income countries like Malawi. However, resources required to manage musculoskeletal trauma remain inadequate. A detailed understanding of the current capacity of Malawian public hospitals to manage musculoskeletal trauma is unknown and necessary for effective trauma system development planning. Methods We developed a list of infrastructure, manpower, and material resources used during treatment of adult femoral shaft fractures–a representative injury managed non-operatively and operatively in Malawi. We identified, by consensus of at least 7 out of 10 experts, which items were essential at district and central hospitals. We surveyed orthopaedic providers in person at all 25 district and 4 central hospitals in Malawi on the presence, availability, and reasons for unavailability of essential resources. We validated survey responses by performing simultaneous independent on-site assessments of 25% of the hospitals. Results No district or central hospital in Malawi had available all the essential resources to adequately manage femoral fractures. On average, district hospitals had 71% (range 41–90%) of essential resources, with at least 15 of 25 reporting unavailability of inpatient ward nurses, x-ray, external fixators, gauze and bandages, and walking assistive devices. District hospitals offered only non-operative treatment, though 24/25 reported barriers to performing skeletal traction. Central hospitals reported an average of 76% (71–85%) of essential resources, with at least 2 of 4 hospitals reporting unavailability of full blood count, inpatient hospital beds, a procedure room, an operating room, casualty/A&E department clinicians, orthopaedic clinicians, a circulating nurse, inpatient ward nurses, electrocardiograms, x-ray, suture, and walking assistive devices. All four central hospitals reported barriers to performing skeletal traction. Operative treatment of femur fracture with a reliable supply of implants was available at 3/4 hospitals, though 2/3 were dependent entirely on foreign donations. Conclusion We identified critical deficiencies in infrastructure, manpower, and essential resources at district and central hospitals in Malawi. Our findings provide evidence-based guidance on how to improve the musculoskeletal trauma system in Malawi, by identifying where and why essential resources were unavailable when needed."
https://openalex.org/W2990947308,"Background As the search for an immune privileged allogeneic donor mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) line continues in equine medicine, the characterization of the cells between different sources becomes important. Our research seeks to more clearly define the MSC marker expression of different equine MSC donors. Methods The bone marrow-derived MSCs from two equine breeds and different blood donor-types were compared over successive culture passages to determine the differential expression of important antigens. Eighteen Thoroughbreds and 18 Standardbreds, including 8 blood donor (erythrocyte Aa, Ca, and Qa antigen negative) horses, were evaluated. Bone marrow was taken from each horse for isolation and culture of MSCs. Samples from passages 2, 4, 6, and 8 were labelled and evaluated by flow cytometry. The cell surface expression of CD11a/18, CD44, CD90 and MHC class II antigens were assessed. Trilineage assays for differentiation into adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic lines were performed to verify characterization of the cells as MSCs. Findings There were significant differences in mesenchymal stem cell marker expression between breeds and blood antigen-type groups over time. Standardbred horses showed a significantly lower expression of MHC class II than did Thoroughbred horses at passages 2, 4 and 6. CD90 was significantly higher in universal blood donor Standardbreds as compared to non-blood donor Standardbreds over all time points. All MSC samples showed high expression of CD44 and low expression of CD11a/18. Conclusions Universal blood donor- type Standardbred MSCs from passages 2–4 show the most ideal antigen expression pattern of the horses and passages that we characterized for use as a single treatment of donor bone marrow-derived MSCs. Further work is needed to determine the significance of this differential expression along with the effect of the expression of MHC I on equine bone marrow-derived MSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2989579785,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with progressive multi-organ failure especially, the brain and kidney and leads to high morbidity and mortality rate. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of renal abnormalities among children with SCD. This cross-sectional study recruited 212 sickling positive patients comprising of 96 Hb AS, 48 Hb SC, and 68 Hb SS phenotypes from the Pediatric Unit of Wassa Akropong Government Hospital, Wassa Akropong, Ghana. Early morning urine and venous blood samples were collected from each participant. Urinalysis was conducted and serum urea and creatinine levels were estimated. Estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Swartz equation. Classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was based on 'The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KIDIGO)' criteria. The mean age of the children were 7.90 years. Serum creatinine (p = 0.0310) and urea (p<0.0001) levels were significantly higher among Hb AS participants compared with Hb SS phenotype. The prevalent indicators of renal abnormalities were proteinuria (26.4%), urine granular cast (5.6%) and CKD (39.6%). Proteinuria, urine granular cast and CKD were most prevalent among Hb SS (47.1%, 11.8% and 73.5% respectively) compared with Hb SC (41.7%, 8.3%, and 45.8% respectively) and Hb AS (4.2%, 0.0%, and 14.5%) phenotypes, respectively. Sickle cell conditions were significantly associated with proteinuria (p<0.0001) and CKD (p = 0.0378). Children with Hb SS [aOR = 5.04, 95% CI (2.47-10.3); p<0.0001] and Hb SC [aOR = 3.14 95% CI (1.39-7.01); p = 0.0174] were at increased odds of developing CKD after adjusting for age, BMI and gender. Proteinuria and CKD are associated with sickle cell disease (Hb SC and Hb SS). Renal function should be routinely monitored for children with SCD."

ERα requires co-activators to mediate transcription via mechanisms that are largely uncharacterized. Herein, using growth-regulating estrogen receptor binding 1 (GREB1) as an ERα target gene in Ishikawa cells, we demonstrate that nuclear receptor co-activator 6 (NCOA6) is essential for estradiol (E2)/ERα–activated GREB1 transcription. We found that NCOA6 associates with the GREB1 promoter and enhancer in an E2-independent manner and that NCOA6 knockout reduces chromatin looping, enhancer–promoter interactions, and basal GREB1 expression in the absence of E2. In the presence of E2, ERα bound the GREB1 enhancer and also associated with its promoter, and p300, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia protein 4 (MLL4), and RNA polymerase II were recruited to the GREB1 enhancer and promoter. Consequently, the levels of the histone modifications H3K4me1/3, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac were significantly increased; enhancer and promoter regions were transcribed; and GREB1 mRNA was robustly transcribed. NCOA6 knockout reduced ERα recruitment and abolished all of the aforementioned E2-induced events, making GREB1 completely insensitive to E2 induction. We also found that GREB1-deficient Ishikawa cells are much more resistant to chemotherapy and that human endometrial cancers with low GREB1 expression predict poor overall survival. These results indicate that NCOA6 has an essential role in ERα-mediated transcription by increasing enhancer–promoter interactions through chromatin looping and by recruiting RNA polymerase II and the histone-code modifiers p300 and MLL4. Moreover, GREB1 loss may predict chemoresistance of endometrial cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2991625830,"Function is an important marker of health throughout the life course, however, in low-and-middle-income-countries, little is known about the burden of functional impairment as women transition from pregnancy to the first year post-partum. Leveraging longitudinal data from 960 women participating in the Share Child Cohort in Pakistan, this study sought to (1) characterize functional trajectories over time among women in their perinatal period and (2) assess predictors of chronic poor functioning following childbirth. We used a group-based trajectory modeling approach to examine maternal patterns of function from the third trimester of pregnancy through 12 months post-partum. Three trajectory groups were found: persistently well-functioning (51% of women), poor functioning with recovery (39% of women), and chronically poor functioning (10% of women). When compared to mothers in the highest functioning group, psychosocial characteristics (e.g., depression, stress, and serious life events) were significantly associated with sustained poor functioning one-year following child-birth. Mothers living in nuclear households were more likely to experience chronic poor functioning. Higher education independently predicted maternal function recovery, even when controlling for psychosocial characteristics. Education, above and beyond socio-economic assets, appears to play an important protective role in maternal functional trajectories following childbirth. Public health implications related to maternal function and perinatal mental health are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2990372820,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) can cause severe gastrointestinal disease and colonization among food handlers. In Japan, STEC infection is a notifiable disease, and food handlers are required to undergo routine stool examination for STEC. However, the molecular epidemiology of STEC is not entirely known. We investigated the genomic characteristics of STEC from patients and asymptomatic food handlers in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 65 STEC isolates obtained from 38 patients and 27 food handlers by public health surveillance in Miyagi Prefecture between April 2016 and March 2017. Isolates of O157:H7 ST11 and O26:H11 ST21 were predominant (n = 19, 29%, respectively). Non-O157 isolates accounted for 69% (n = 45) of all isolates. Among 48 isolates with serotypes found in the patients (serotype O157:H7 and 5 non-O157 serotypes, O26:H11, O103:H2, O103:H8, O121:H19 and O145:H28), adhesion genes eae, tir, and espB, and type III secretion system genes espA, espJ, nleA, nleB, and nleC were detected in 41 to 47 isolates (85–98%), whereas isolates with other serotypes found only in food handlers were negative for all of these genes. Non-O157 isolates were especially prevalent among patients younger than 5 years old. Shiga-toxin gene stx1a, adhesion gene efa1, secretion system genes espF and cif, and fimbrial gene lpfA were significantly more frequent among non-O157 isolates from patients than among O157 isolates from patients. The most prevalent resistance genes among our STEC isolates were aminoglycoside resistance genes, followed by sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim resistance genes. WGS revealed that 20 isolates were divided into 9 indistinguishable core genomes (<5 SNPs), demonstrating clonal expansion of these STEC strains in our region, including an O26:H11 strain with stx1a+stx2a. Non-O157 STEC with multiple virulence genes were prevalent among both patients and food handlers in our region of Japan, highlighting the importance of monitoring the genomic characteristics of STEC."
https://openalex.org/W2990876983,"Advances in genomic technologies and the development of targeted therapeutics are making the use of precision medicine increasingly possible. In this study, we explored whether precision medicine can be applied for the management of refractory/relapsed pediatric solid tumors by discovering actionable alterations using targeted panel sequencing. Samples of refractory/relapsed pediatric solid tumors were tested using a targeted sequencing panel covering the exonic DNA sequences of 381 cancer genes and introns across 22 genes to detect clinically significant genomic aberrations in tumors. The molecular targets were tiered from 1 to 5 based on the presence of actionable genetic alterations, strength of supporting evidence, and drug availability in the Republic of Korea. From January 2016 to October 2018, 55 patients were enrolled. The median time from tissue acquisition to drug selection was 29 d (range 14–39), and tumor profiling was successful in 53 (96.4%) patients. A total of 27 actionable alterations in tiers 1–4 were detected in 20 patients (36.4%), and the majority of actionable alterations were copy number variations. The tiers of molecular alterations were tier 1 (clinical evidence) in 4 variants, tier 2 (preclinical evidence) in 8 variants, tier 3 (consensus opinion) in 2 variants, and tier 4 (actionable variants with a drug that is available in other countries but not in the Republic of Korea) in 9 variants. In one patient with relapsed neuroblastoma with ALK F1174L mutation and ALK amplification, lorlatinib was used in a compassionate use program, and it showed some efficacy. In conclusion, using a targeted sequencing panel to discover actionable alterations in relapsed/refractory pediatric solid tumors was practical and feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2990088513,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted pathogen in the United States, causing 99% of cervical cancers and 5% of all human cancers worldwide. HPV infection requires transport of the viral genome (vDNA) into the nucleus of basal keratinocytes. During this process, minor capsid protein L2 facilitates subcellular retrograde trafficking of the vDNA from endosomes to the Golgi, and accumulation at host chromosomes during mitosis for nuclear retention and localization during interphase. Here we investigated the relationship between cellular glutathione (GSH) and HPV16 infection. siRNA knockdown of GSH biosynthetic enzymes results in a partial decrease of HPV16 infection. Likewise, infection of HPV16 in GSH depleted keratinocytes is inefficient, an effect that was not seen with adenoviral vectors. Analysis of trafficking revealed no defects in cellular binding, entry, furin cleavage of L2, or retrograde trafficking of HPV16, but GSH depletion hindered post-Golgi trafficking and translocation, decreasing nuclear accumulation of vDNA. Although precise mechanisms have yet to be defined, this work suggests that GSH is required for a specific post-Golgi trafficking step in HPV16 infection."

Previous studies have focused primarily on its growth characteristics, stress resistance, and pharmacological applications; however, molecular investigations remain limited. Considering germplasm conservation and the extensive applications of this plant, it is necessary to explore transcriptome resources and SSR makers for C. trichotomum. In the present study, RNA sequencing was used to determine the transcriptome of C. trichotomum. Subsequently, unigene annotations and classifications were obtained, and SSRs were mined with MIcroSAtellite. Finally, primer pairs designed with Oligo 6.0 were selected for polymorphism validation. In total, 127,325,666 high-quality reads were obtained, and 58,345 non-redundant unigenes were generated, of which 36,900 (63.24%) were annotated. Among the annotated unigenes, 35,980 (97.51%) had significant similarity to 607 species in Nr databases. In addition, a total of 6,444 SSRs were identified in 5,530 unigenes, and 200 random primer pairs were designed for polymorphism validation. Furthermore, after primary polymorphism identification, 30 polymorphic primer pairs were selected for the further polymorphism screening, and 200 alleles were identified, 197 of which showed polymorphism. In this work, a large number of unigenes were generated, and numerous SSRs were detected. These findings should be beneficial for further investigations into germplasm conservation and various applications of C. trichotomum. These results should also provide a solid foundation for future molecular biology studies in C. trichotomum."
https://openalex.org/W2991344539,"Globally, pneumonia accounted for 16% of deaths among children under 5 years of age and was one of the major causes of death overall in 2018. Kenya is ranked among the top 15 countries with regard to pneumonia prevalence and contributed approximately 74% of the world's annual pneumonia cases in 2018. Unfortunately, less than 50% of children with pneumonia receive appropriate antibiotics for treatment. Homa-Bay County implemented pneumonia community case management utilizing community health workers, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2014. However, since implementation of the program, the relative patient-level cost of home-based and facility-based treatment of pneumonia, as well as the main drivers of these costs in Suba Subcounty, remain uncertain. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to compare the patient-level costs of home based treatment of pneumonia by a community health worker with those of health facility-based treatment.Using a cross-sectional study design, a structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data from 208 caregivers on the direct costs (consultation, medicine, transportation) and indirect costs (opportunity cost) of pneumonia treatment. The average household cost for the community managed patients was KSH 122.65 ($1.29) compared with KSh 447.46 ($4.71), a 4-fold difference, for those treated at the health facility. The largest cost drivers for home treatment and health facility treatment were opportunity costs (KSH 88.25 ($ 0.93)) and medicine costs (KSH 126.16 ($ 1.33)), respectively.This study demonstrates that the costs incurred for home-based pneumonia management are considerably lower compared to those incurred for facility-based management. Opportunity costs (caregiver time and forgone wages) and the cost of medication were the key cost-drivers in the management of pneumonia at the health facility and at home, respectively. These findings emphasize the need to strengthen and scale community case management to overcome barriers and delays in accessing the correct treatment for pneumonia for sick children under 5 years of age."
https://openalex.org/W2991456841,"To assess changes in frequency, severity, complications, therapy and outcome of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients treated in stroke units in Austria, we evaluated data from the Austrian Stroke Unit Registry between 2008 and 2016.Data of 6707 cases of ICH covering a time span of 9 years and including information on age, risk factors, pre-stroke modified Rankin Score (mRS), baseline stroke severity (NIHSS), complications, therapy, functional outcome, and mortality were extracted from the Austrian Stroke Unit Registry. A multivariate regularized logistic regression model and linear models for temporal dependence were computed for analyzing statistical inference and time trends. Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple testing. Between 2008 and 2016, the proportion of ICH admissions to stroke units in Austria declined, with a shift among patients towards older age (>70 years, p = 0.04) and lower admission NIHSS scores. While no significant time trends in risk factors, pre-stroke mRS and medical complications were observed, therapeutic interventions declined significantly (p<0.001). Three-month mortality increased over the years independently (p = 0.003).Despite declining incidence and clinical severity of ICH we observed a clear increase in three-month mortality. This effect seems to be independent of predictors including age, admission NIHSS, pre-morbid MRS, or medical complications. The observations from this large retrospective database cohort study underline an urgent call for action in the therapy of ICH."
https://openalex.org/W2991145255,"Determining the identity of children is critical to aid in the fight against child exploitation, as well as for passport control and visa issuance purposes. Facial image comparison is one method that may be used to determine identity. Due to the substantial amount of facial growth that occurs in childhood, it is critical to understand facial image comparison performance across both chronological age (the age of the child), and age variation (the age difference between images). In this study we examined the performance of 120 facial comparison practitioners from a government agency on a dataset of 23,760 image pairs selected from the agency's own database of controlled, operational images. Each chronological age in childhood (0-17 years) and age variations ranging from 0-10 years were examined. Practitioner performance was found to vary considerably across childhood, and depended on whether the pairs were mated (same child) or non-mated (different child). Overall, practitioners were more accurate and confident with image pairs containing older children, and also more accurate and confident with smaller age variations. Chronological age impacted on accuracy with mated pairs, but age variation did not. In contrast, both age and age variation impacted on accuracy with non-mated pairs. These differences in performance show that changes in the face throughout childhood have a significant impact on practitioner performance. We propose that improvements in accuracy may be achievable with a better understanding of which facial features are most appropriate to compare across childhood, and adjusting training and development programs accordingly."
