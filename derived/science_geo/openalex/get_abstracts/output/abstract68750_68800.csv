https://openalex.org/W1576879289,"Abstract The activity and stability of l-ornithine decarboxylase from rat ventral prostate is markedly increased by certain thiol compounds, notably dithiothreitol. The enzyme was purified about 300-fold. Many properties of the purified enzyme are described. In the absence of added thiol compounds, the purified ornithine decarboxylase apparently undergoes polymerization, as evidenced by its behavior on sucrose density gradients and in molecular sieving experiments. The larger forms of the enzyme appear to be catalytically inert, but can be reactivated by a number of sulfhydryl compounds, certain dithiols being superior to a number of monothiols in this respect."
https://openalex.org/W2061302709,"Eyes were removed from rats shortly after birth, when there are few formed synapses in the colliculus. It was found that synaptogenesis continues to give a near-normal ratio of terminals containing either spheroidal or flattened vesicles. After eye removal in adult rats, however, reinvasion of synaptic sites vacated by degenerate optic terminals occurs, with an incomplete return toward a normal proportion of synaptic types."
https://openalex.org/W2073852168,"Diffuse retinal irradiation by visible light produces in the rat the death of visual cells and pigment epithelium. Typically, cage illumination of 1500 lux from fluorescent light through a green filter leads to severe damage when continued for 40 hours. Vitamin A deficiency protects against this damage but experiments show that retinol released by light from rhodopsin is probably not the toxic agent. Protection against light damage depends on a long-range state of cell adaptation to light itself. The normal diurnal cycle of light and dark seems to be the essential factor in controlling visual cell viability and susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2023869222,"After injection of tritiated amino acid into the mouse eye, radioactivity appeared in the contralateral visual cortex, indicating that some material had been transferred from optic axons to lateral geniculate neurons. The radioactivity in the cortex was about 2 percent of that arriving in the geniculate, and most of it was contained in material that appeared to be protein."
https://openalex.org/W2023682801,The 11-hydroxy metabolites of Delta(8).- and Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol are more active than the parent compounds when administered to mice by either the intravenous or intracerebral route. Both Delta(8)- and Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol are rapidly and extensively metabolized by the liver and not by the brain. The hypothesis that the 11-hydroxy metabolites may be the active form of tetrahydrocannabinol is discussed
https://openalex.org/W1529584344,"Abstract Synthesis and turnover of nitrate reductase molecules and soluble proteins of tobacco XD cells were studied by labeling pre-existing proteins with 14C-arginine to make them radioactive and with 99 atom % 15N to increase their buoyant density. The cells were then transferred to medium in which new proteins were synthesized from 14N and were radioactively labeled with 3H-arginine. The breakdown of 15N-labeled proteins was followed after transfer of cells to 14N medium by means of the 14C label. The influence of the pre-existing pool of 15N-amino acids on the density of newly synthesized proteins was followed by means of the 3H label. At various times protein was extracted and subjected to isopycnic equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl. Buoyant densities, relative to an added standard, catalase, were determined for nitrate reductase activity, 14C-labeled protein, and 3H-labeled protein. The studies were carried out (a) during induction of nitrate reductase activity, (b) after full induction, when the level of nitrate reductase activity remains constant, and (c) after a shift from inducing to noninducing conditions, when nitrate reductase activity decays. The buoyant density data show that nitrate reductase activity induced by nitrate is an activity of a protein synthesized de novo after addition of inducer. However, even when the enzyme level was constant, the buoyant density of nitrate reductase decreased from that of 15N-nitrate reductase towards that of 14N-nitrate reductase, indicating that the enzyme turned over. Furthermore, nitrate reductase molecules continued to be synthesized as nitrate reductase activity decayed under noninducing conditions. Turnover of both pre-existing proteins labeled with 14C and newly synthesized proteins labeled with 3H was also observed."
https://openalex.org/W1966825846,"Aromatic amino acids are photooxidized by near-ultraviolet light to colored products that are bound very tightly to protein amino groups. The resulting colored proteins absorb near-ultraviolet light more strongly and are rendered more hydrophobic than the untreated compounds, and they fluoresce at 440 nanometers when excited at 360 nanometers. Coloration in the lenses of diurnally active animals (including man) may be caused by this reaction, and senile cataracts may result. Such changes in many other proteins (as in the skin and retina) could lead to more serious consequences."

https://openalex.org/W1984946513,"The effects of vitamin A deficiency in the rat eye, as measured by the electroretinogram and changes in rhodopsin content, are critically dependent upon the levels of illumination to which the animals are exposed daily. Depleted animals kept in darkness maintained virtually normal electroretinogram function and rhodopsin content for 5 to 6 months while those kept in weak cyclic light lost rhodopsin continuously. A fraction of the retinol released from rhodopsin during illumination disappears presumably from the pigment epithelium into the blood and becomes unavailable for rhodopsin regeneration. A sequence of three first-order reactions was assumed to estimate the rate constant of this disappearance (0.03 per hour). Computer simulation supporting the experimental data illustrates the dependence of the retinal abnormalities on light."
https://openalex.org/W2084255093,"A procedure is described for the intrauterine detection, at the 17th week of gestation, of a male fetus afflicted with Fabry's disease. The validity of this determination was substantiated by multiple enzyme and lipid analyses of tissue specimens obtained from the afflicted fetus. Fabry's disease may now be included with other X-linked metabolic deficiency diseases that are amenable to precise genetic counseling, through carrier identification, and the monitoring of ensuing pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W1656968299,"Polytene and nonpolytene nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster were isolated from larval salivary glands and imaginal discs, respectively. The histones of the two types of nuclei yield identical patterns on gel electrophoresis but differ considerably from those of sea urchins, birds, and mammals in the positions of F1, F2b, and possibly F3. The greatest difference is in the F1 (lysine-rich) histone, which in the case of Drosophila has a much lower electrophoretic mobility. The low mobility appears to be due to both a higher molecular weight and a lower basicity. This is the first indication of molecular weight differences between F1 histones of animals. In addition, the Drosophila F1 histone differs from mammalian F1 histones in containing a significant amount of histidine and increased amounts of serine, aspartate, valine, and isoleucine. The amino acid composition and molecular weight estimates indicate that the amount of lysine per molecule is similar to that in calf thymus F1 histone while the amounts of several other amino acids are increased. Since mammalian F1 histone is known to contain a highly basic region rich in lysine, our results suggest that the Drosophila protein may have a similar lysine-rich region, but a quite different and larger nonbasic region or regions."
https://openalex.org/W2081723321,"Slave-maker ants of the Formica sanguinea group direct their raids by means of odor trails. Artificial trails made from whole-body extracts and extracts of Dufour's glands and hindguts can be used to guide columns of workers to selected target colonies and to initiate raids. In workers of F. pergandei and F. subintegra, members of the F. sanguinea group, the Dufour's glands are hypertrophied and contain large quantities of three acetates (decyl, dodecyl, and tetradecyl), which are discharged at defending workers during the slave raids. The acetates produce very efficient, long-lasting alarm signals that attract the slave-makers but disperse the defenders; in effect, therefore, they are ""propaganda substances."""
https://openalex.org/W1500715867,"Abstract We have studied in the rabbit reticulocyte and the pigeon erythrocyte the interactions between Na+ and various neutral amino acids with respect to transport by an apparently ubiquitous Na+-dependent system that prefers the linear aliphatic and hydroxy aliphatic amino acids. In the series, alanine to norleucine, stronger and stronger apolar bonding to the transport site with increasing chain length is suggested. The interaction with Na+ is in contrast strong when the side chain is a methyl group, and weaker when it exceeds the length of the ethyl group. Other alkali metals will generally not serve. Instead they inhibit in competition with Na+. A hydroxyl group on carbon 3 or 4 of the amino acid leads to an even stronger interaction with Na+, but its effect becomes unfavorable if it is farther removed from the carboxyl group. Mercapto and carboxamide groups produce similar effects. If the orientation of the hydroxyl group is trans with reference to the carboxylate group, a strong transport-producing interaction results; a cis orientation instead lowers the apparent affinity. On the basis of this and other evidence, we suggest that the two cosubstrates bind in juxtaposition at the receptor site, and that a substantial portion of the observed interaction occurs directly between them. This research provides the first evidence for the location of Na+ binding in a transport system specific for Na+ and a neutral substrate. The kinetics of this two-substrate system appears to be random order, with a different step rate-limiting for transport of Na+ than of the amino acid."
https://openalex.org/W2040981273,"Injection of norepinephrine in the lateral ventricles of rats recovering from lateral hypothalamic anorexia caused immediate feeding and, frequently, overeating. Intraventricular administration of the alpha-noradrenergic blocker, phentolamine, suppressed feeding in both normal rats and rats that had recovered from lateral hypothalamic lesions. Feeding is reinforced by ascending medial forebrain bundle fibers that form alpha-noradrenergic synapses in the hypothalamus and forebrain. Damage to these fibers suppresses feeding by reducing noradrenergic transmission and, hence, the rewarding value of food. Recovery of feeding after hypothalamic lesions coincides with the recovery of noradrenergic reward function."

https://openalex.org/W2024713929,"The nuclei of the giant neurons of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica can contain more than 0.2 microgram of DNA. This is more than 200,000 times as much DNA as the haploid amount found in Aplysia sperm. On the basis of nuclear DNA content, the giant neurons R-2, P-1, and L-6 of adult animals can each be divided into at least two populations. The mean DNA content of these two populations (0.067 and 0.131 microgram of DNA) are approximately related by a factor of 2. This suggests that much and perhaps all of the genome replicates repeatedly (up to 16 times) during the growth and development of these neurons and that each replication is synchronous. The enormous amount of DNA in these cells opens up the possibility of characterizing the DNA and other constituents of chromatin from individual but phenotypically different neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2089434271,Regression analysis of daily mortality in Los Angeles County shows that there is a significant association between community carbon monoxide concentrations and mortality. Cyclic variation and maximum temperature were the main contributors. No association was demonstrated between oxidant and mortality.
https://openalex.org/W1959168549,"Abstract Incubation of cartilage from chick embryos with 14C-3,5-cis-hydroxy-dl-proline demonstrated that cis-hydroxyproline is incorporated into the collagen and other protein synthesized by the tissue. Gel filtration of extracts from the tissue demonstrated that the proteins synthesized in the presence of cis-hydroxyproline were about the same size as proteins synthesized under control conditions. Incubation of the tissue with both 3H-puromycin of known specific activity and 14C-cis-hydroxyproline made it possible to estimate the degree to which the analogue replaced proline and hydroxyproline in collagen. The results indicated that with 48 µg per ml of cis-hydroxyproline, about 10% of the proline and hydroxyproline residues in collagen were replaced by the analogue. With 194 µg per ml of the analogue, about 61% of the proline and hydroxyproline residues were replaced by cis-hydroxyproline. Incubation of the tissue with 14C-proline or 14C-lysine and with cis-hydroxyproline indicated that the proline and lysine still incorporated into collagen in the presence of the analogue were hydroxylated and glycosylated to a normal extent. Autoradiographs of the tissue indicated that the collagen containing cis-hydroxyproline was not extruded into the extracellular matrix at a normal rate. The decreased rate of extrusion of collagen containing cis-hydroxyproline can be explained in one of two ways. (a) The presence of cis-hydroxyproline in the collagen molecules specifically interferes with extrusion, or (b) the substitution of cis-hydroxyproline at sites in protocollagen which are normally converted to trans-hydroxyproline prevents the trans-hydroxyproline content from reaching a level necessary for extrusion from the cell at a normal rate."
https://openalex.org/W2149655278,"Mammary epithelial cells in organ culture incorporate 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BUdR) into DNA during a single cycle of DNA replication. The specific milk proteins, casein and α-lactalbumin, are induced by prolactin in control mammary cells, but the induction of these proteins is markedly inhibited in cells which contain BUdR-DNA. This is a selective effect, since the induction of the galactosyltransferase of lactose synthetase is not inhibited, and the rate of total protein synthesis is only slightly decreased in such cells. Incubation of mammary cells with BUdR after completion of DNA synthesis did not inhibit the induction of casein or α-lactalbumin. Thus BUdR appears to selectively inhibit the expression of genes which are uniquely expressed in differentiated mammary secretory cells. Formation of transfer RNA, total rapidly labeled nuclear RNA, and ribosomal RNA was unaltered in cells containing BUdR-DNA. However, a marked reduction of prolactin-stimulated polysome formation was observed. Initiation of casein synthesis in these cells has been previously shown to be dependent upon the formation of prolactin-induced polysomes. BUdR inhibited milk protein induction by more than 90%. This result suggests that only mammary daughter cells containing the newly synthesized sense strand of DNA may express differentiated function."
https://openalex.org/W1500384899,"A lysine-rich histone fraction (Fraction 3) from rabbit thymus has a diminished capacity to accept phosphate transferred by a liver histone kinase preparation. Certain lysine-rich histone components from other species are also not readily phosphorylated. Examination of tryptic peptides of individual rabbit thymus lysine-rich histone fractions shows that Fraction 4, a readily phosphorylated fraction, contains serine in a location previously shown to be a major site of lysine-rich histone phosphorylation, while Fraction 3 contains alanine in this position. Fraction 3 and Fraction 4 of rabbit thymus lysine-rich histone therefore differ in primary structure by virtue of an alanine-serine replacement which determines the presence or absence of a major site of enzymatic phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2093552772,"Cycloheximide, when injected subcutaneously or intracerebrally, produces changes in the activity level of mice. Isocycloheximide, injected intracerebrally, produces identical effects on activity, but it does not produce inhibition of cerebral protein synthesis or amnesia. Amphetamine, in doses that can antagonize the amnesic action of cycloheximide, does not antagonize the effect of cycloheximide on activity. Effects of cycloheximide on activity do not appear to be responsible for its amnesic action."
https://openalex.org/W1495783055,"Abstract Inhibition of uptake of cationic amino acids by certain neutral amino acids in the presence of alkali metal ions has been studied in the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell, in the rabbit reticulocyte and in yeast. When a hydroxyl group is introduced on carbon 4 (for the reticulocyte) or carbon 5 (for the Ehrlich cell) of straight chain amino acids, a sharp shift in the selectivity among the alkali metal ions occurs in favor of Na+ or of Na+ and K+ in the two animal cells. This shift is associated with attainment of a maximal interaction between the neutral amino acid and the alkali metal, and is taken to support a bridging by the ion between the amino acid and the receptor site. Although in both potassium-treated and glucose-treated yeast neutral amino acids also become much more inhibitory to cationic amino acid uptake in the presence of alkali metal ions, no augmentation has been observed on introduction of a side chain hydroxyl group, and selectivity among the ions is weak. Hence a bridging function is doubted for that organism. The ions exert additional inhibitory effects, independent of the presence of a neutral amino acid, which appear to be competitive with H+."

This compound, which is repellent to ants and therefore defensively useful to the grasshopper, probably stems from herbicide or herbicide derivative ingested by the insect with its diet. Although there is precedent for the defensive employ by one species of chemical agents produced by another, no instance was known involving secondary utilization of a pesticide dispensed by man."

The maximum net rate at which the hydroxylase activity accumulates is about the same when phenobarbital, 3-methlcholanthrene, or benz[a]anthracene is in the growth medium at optimum concentrations. An additive effect is obtained when either phenobarbital or p.p'-DDT is present with a polycyclic hydrocarbon in the growth medium, but not when the cells are treated with phenobarbital plus p.p'-DDT or with the combination of two polycyclic hydrocarbons."

https://openalex.org/W1594792423,"Abstract The hemoglobin from the annelid polychaete Glycera dibranchiata, present in large coelomic erythrocytes, was demonstrated to be of a heterogeneous nature with respect to both electrophoretic properties and molecular weight. On the basis of gel filtration, sedimentation velocity, and sedimentation equilibrium studies, 2 basic hemoglobin units were found: a monomer with a molecular weight of approximately 17,000 and a polydisperse higher order aggregate. The ratio of monomeric to polymeric hemoglobin was 0.85 (±0.10):1. Determination of iron content by atomic absorption spectroscopy and pyridine-hemochromogen determination revealed a minimum molecular weight of 18,400 to 19,700 for both monomer and polymer. Electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal studies of the globins obtained from the monomer and aggregate indicate the subunits are extremely similar with respect to molecular weight. Both the monomeric and polymeric globins gave similar patterms by disc gel electrophoresis. Each was found to contain two similar components. These data suggest that two hemoglobin monomers capable of polymerization are present."
https://openalex.org/W1480630110,"Abstract The incorporation in vivo of 32P-phosphate, 3H-amino acids and 5-3H-orotic acid into the nuclear components of rat liver has been studied at various times after partial hepatectomy. Basic proteins and other dissociable components were eluted from nuclei trapped in polyacrylamide gel using a series of gradients of increasing ionic strength and decreasing pH. No evidence was found that newly synthesized ribonucleic acid is covalently bound to histones. Several histones were synthesized but not phosphorylated. One preformed histone component was found to be phosphorylated at about 15 hours after partial hepatectomy. Further characterization of this phosphohistone using a conventional procedure to isolate histones showed that it was the slightly lysine-rich histone IIb1 phosphorylated at a single site (its N-terminal seryl residue). This phosphorylation may be a specific control event occurring at one time during the liver regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W1530043158,"Abstract The kinetic properties of the purified pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) from the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus licheniformis were investigated. Catalysis by this enzyme in vitro required both monovalent and divalent cations and proceeded optimally at pH 7.0 to 7.4. The activity of purified pyruvate kinase was modulated by substrate activation (both P-enolpyruvate and ADP), activation by AMP, and inhibition by ATP, Pi, and carbamyl phosphate. Positive cooperativity was shown for P-enolpyruvate, ADP, ATP, and Pi. The inhibition by ATP yielded sigmoidal saturation curves for both P-enolpyruvate and ADP in the presence of Mg(II) ions. AMP relieved the inhibition caused by ATP, yielding hyperbolic saturation curves for both substrates. The apparent substrate Km values, 0.2 mm for P-enolpyruvate, and 0.7 mm for ADP, for the fully activated enzyme in the presence of Mg(II) were not dependent on the concentration of the second substrate. The kinetic properties observed with Mn(II) as the activating divalent cation were somewhat different than those observed in the presence of Mg(II). The apparent Km for P-enolpyruvate was 7-fold lower in the presence of Mn(II) than the value obtained in the presence of Mg(II). Furthermore, the inhibition of the Mn(II)-activated enzyme by ATP did not alter the hyperbolic nature of the P-enolpyruvate saturation curve and was not relieved by AMP. Therefore, the K type allosteric properties that were observed with Mg(II) as the activating divalent cation were not manifested in the presence of Mn(II)."
https://openalex.org/W1518471330,"Abstract Ribosomes from muscle of diabetic rats synthesized less polyphenylalanine than normal ribosomes at low magnesium concentrations (5 to 10 mm), but they were more active than normal ribosomes at high magnesium concentrations (12.5 to 20 mm). The magnesium dependence of binding of phenylalanyl transfer RNA to normal and diabetic ribosomes closely paralleled the synthesis of polyphenylalanine. A portion of the radioactivity associated with ribosomes when binding of 14C-Phe-tRNA was assayed cochromatographed, after hydrolysis, with phenylalanine; the remainder did not migrate from the origin. At 7.5 mm magnesium, the greater amount of 14C-Phe-tRNA bound to normal ribosomes was accounted for by the formation of origin material. The origin material was identified as a peptide with carboxyl-terminal 14C-phenylalanine. Removal of peptidyltRNA by incubation with puromycin abolished the difference in the ability of normal and diabetic ribosomes to synthesize polyphenylalanine and to bind Phe-tRNA. We suggest that only ribosomes that have peptidyl-tRNA can bind Phe-tRNA at low magnesium concentrations. Since normal ribosomes contain more peptidyl-tRNA than diabetic ribosomes, they would bind more Phe-tRNA and synthesize more polyphenylalanine at low magnesium concentration."

Columns containing the oligonucleotide-celluloses preferentially retain complementary oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides.

The data indicate that probably the entire oligonucleotide attached to the cellulose is capable of hydrogen bonding with its complementary sequence, and that the resolution obtained with these columns is such that oligonucleotides differing in length by 1 nucleotide residue may be resolved. Preliminary experiments suggest that these oligonucleotide-celluloses are capable of selectively removing a complementary sequence of nucleic acid from a mixture of nucleic acids."
https://openalex.org/W1492105562,"Abstract Pseudomonas putida P2 (ATCC 25571) grown on l-lysine or dl-pipecolic acid is induced for a high velocity lysine transport system. Double reciprocal plots of l-lysine transport in induced cells are linear. Km and Vmax values are 7.3 x 10-6 m and 130 nmoles per min per mg for lysine-grown cells and 9.3 x 10-6 m and 42 nmoles per min per mg for cells grown on pipecolate. Lysine transport is optimal at 30° and at pH 6.5 to 7.5, and is inhibited by azide and by cyanide. Induction of the transport system is accompanied by an increase in the levels of enzymes of lysine catabolism. d-Lysine and the d- and l-isomers of arginine and ornithine inhibit l-lysine transport, and l-ornithine and l-arginine are transported by lysine-grown cells. Structural features important for inhibition of l-lysine transport include α-amino and α-carboxyl groups and a positive charge removed from the α-carbon by three to four methylene groups. Similar Michaelis constants, temperature profiles, and responses to a wide range of amino acids and amines are found for l-lysine transport by cells grown either on lysine or pipecolate."

https://openalex.org/W1590182093,"Abstract Diets containing 0.2% acetylsalicylic acid were fed to control and thiamine-deficient rats. Acetylsalicylic acid caused a significant decrease in body weight and adipose tissue weight in thiamine-deficient acetylsalicylic acid-treated but not in normal acetylsalicylic acid-treated rats. A large decrease in the total blood ketone bodies in thiamine-deficient acetylsalicylic acid-treated rats was observed. A significant decrease in the blood β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate ratio in both control and thiamine-deficient rats treated with aspirin was noted. Rat liver mitochondria from both control, thiamine-deficient, and acetylsalicylic acid fed rats were incubated in the presence of ATP, Mg+2, Pi, pyruvate, and radioactive bicarbonate, and synthesis of dicarboxylic acids was examined. It was found that in acetylsalicylic acid-treated rats, the pyruvate utilization and 14CO2 incorporation and organic acids formation were greatly decreased. Addition of octanoylcarnitine greatly stimulated 14CO2 incorporation into organic acids in thiamine-deficient and acetylsalicylic acid-treated rats. The percentage of pyruvate carboxylated in the presence of octanoylcarnitine was significantly increased in mitochondria from all animals."
