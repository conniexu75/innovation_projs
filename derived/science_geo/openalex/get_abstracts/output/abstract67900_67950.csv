https://openalex.org/W2043231452,"MANY systems being studied today are dynamic, large and complex: traffic at an airport with 100 planes, slum areas with 104 persons or the human brain with 1010 neurones. In such systems, stability is of central importance, for instability usually appears as a self-generating catastrophe. Unfortunately, present theoretical knowledge of stability in large systems is meagre: the work described here was intended to add to it."

https://openalex.org/W2093186940,"This article began by suggesting that different processes are likely to mediate alterations in behavior and cognitive structure and that conditioning principles do not seem sufficient to explain all the classes of change. Although the acquisition of conditioned responses, the potentiation of inborn capacities, and the establishment of schemata probably implicate different processes, all three involve selective attention to sensory events, whether these events function as conditioned stimuli, releasers of innate response dispositions, or the bases for mental representations. Hence, better understanding of the forces that control selectivity and duration of attention should provide insights into the nature of psychological growth, especially the lawful alterations in cognitive structure that seem to occur continually as a function of the child's encounter with discrepant events. The heart of this article was devoted to this theme. It was argued that events that possessed a high rate of change in their physical characteristics, that were moderately discrepant from established schemata, and that activated hypotheses in the service of assimilation had the greatest power to recruit and maintain attention in the young child."

https://openalex.org/W2093524613,"STUDIES on conditions resulting in the premature termination of pregnancy indicate that the male conceptus may be less well adapted to survive in the maternal host than the female. Sex chromatin determinations1 carried out on chorionic villi of spontaneously aborted foetuses have shown that the majority of foetuses lost are male2,3. Moreover, more male foetuses than female seem to be involved in premature termination as a result of antepartum haemorrhage4. Because the trophoblast is the foetal tissue most intimately associated with the maternal host during pregnancy, we decided to examine the influence of foetal sex on the ability of trophoblast cells to survive as allografts."

https://openalex.org/W1510891837,Abstract Two descobaltocorrins prepared from growing cultures of Chromatium (ATCC 17899) have been identified as phenylhydrogenobamide and hydrogenobyric acid. The structure of phenylhydrogenobamide was established by insertion of cobalt under neutral conditions and conversion of the obtained corrinoid into cobamide and phenol by acid hydrolysis. The identification of hydrogenobyric acid consisted of its conversion into cobyric acid. Methods for the preparation of the corresponding copper and zinc analogues are described. The structures of the synthesized currins and zirrins are confirmed by their spectral and electrophoretic properties.

https://openalex.org/W1560799393,"Abstract Purified very lysine-rich histones (histone I) from trout testis, liver, and erythrocytes, frog liver and erythrocytes, chicken liver and erythrocytes, rabbit liver, and calf thymus were phosphorylated by trout testis protamine kinase and γ-32P-ATP. The extent of phosphorylation obtained varied widely for the different histones I. Autoradiography after tryptic digestion and paper electrophoresis of the phosphorylated histones revealed several different major phosphopeptides from the nine tissues examined. Differences were found both in the phosphopeptide pattern of histone I from different organs in the same species and from the same organ in different species. Rat liver histone kinase phosphorylated the same major site in trout testis histone I as did protamine kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2066400104,"Mercury compounds and free mercury are determined by emission spectrophotometry in a radiofrequency helium plasma. The method is simple, rapid, directly applicable to environmental water samples, and subject to few interferences. The useful working range is 10 nanograms to 10 micrograms, or 1 part per billion to 1 part per million in 10 milliliters of sample. The limit of detection is about 2 nanograms."
https://openalex.org/W2025684581,"The crystal structure of the red picric acid salt of serotonin was determined by x-ray diffraction methods. The structure consists of parallel hydroxyindole and picrate planes which are intimately stacked with an interplanar separation of 3.3 to 3.4 angstroms. The stacking interaction appears to be of the donor-acceptor (charge-transfer) type, involving specific contacts between picrate nitro groups and atoms of the hydroxyindole moieties. Similar interactions might mediate biological processes involving serotonin."

https://openalex.org/W1517549392,"Abstract A pathway for the degradation of the cyclopropane ring in cyclopropanecarboxylic acid has been indicated. The fungus Fusarium oxysporum Schlectendahl converts cyclopropanecarboxylic acid to γ-hydroxybutyric acid through a derivative of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid. This derivative of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, but not free cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, can be converted to γ-hydroxybutyric acid by cell-free extracts of the microorganism. The enzymatic activity of the extract is labile and markedly dependent on pH."
