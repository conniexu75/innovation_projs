https://openalex.org/W1990950572,"Several studies demonstrated that treatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reduces cisplatin mortality in mice. Microvesicles (MVs) released from MSCs were previously shown to favor renal repair in non lethal toxic and ischemic acute renal injury (AKI). In the present study we investigated the effects of MSC-derived MVs in SCID mice survival in lethal cisplatin-induced AKI. Moreover, we evaluated in vitro the effect of MVs on cisplatin-induced apoptosis of human renal tubular epithelial cells and the molecular mechanisms involved. Two different regimens of MV injection were used. The single administration of MVs ameliorated renal function and morphology, and improved survival but did not prevent chronic tubular injury and persistent increase in BUN and creatinine. Multiple injections of MVs further decreased mortality and at day 21 surviving mice showed normal histology and renal function. The mechanism of protection was mainly ascribed to an anti-apoptotic effect of MVs. In vitro studies demonstrated that MVs up-regulated in cisplatin-treated human tubular epithelial cells anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl-xL, Bcl2 and BIRC8 and down-regulated genes that have a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis such as Casp1, Casp8 and LTA. In conclusion, MVs released from MSCs were found to exert a pro-survival effect on renal cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that MVs may contribute to renal protection conferred by MSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2048410549,"Background Crocodilians have dominated predatory niches at the water-land interface for over 85 million years. Like their ancestors, living species show substantial variation in their jaw proportions, dental form and body size. These differences are often assumed to reflect anatomical specialization related to feeding and niche occupation, but quantified data are scant. How these factors relate to biomechanical performance during feeding and their relevance to crocodilian evolutionary success are not known. Methodology/Principal Findings We measured adult bite forces and tooth pressures in all 23 extant crocodilian species and analyzed the results in ecological and phylogenetic contexts. We demonstrate that these reptiles generate the highest bite forces and tooth pressures known for any living animals. Bite forces strongly correlate with body size, and size changes are a major mechanism of feeding evolution in this group. Jaw shape demonstrates surprisingly little correlation to bite force and pressures. Bite forces can now be predicted in fossil crocodilians using the regression equations generated in this research. Conclusions/Significance Critical to crocodilian long-term success was the evolution of a high bite-force generating musculo-skeletal architecture. Once achieved, the relative force capacities of this system went essentially unmodified throughout subsequent diversification. Rampant changes in body size and concurrent changes in bite force served as a mechanism to allow access to differing prey types and sizes. Further access to the diversity of near-shore prey was gained primarily through changes in tooth pressure via the evolution of dental form and distributions of the teeth within the jaws. Rostral proportions changed substantially throughout crocodilian evolution, but not in correspondence with bite forces. The biomechanical and ecological ramifications of such changes need further examination."
https://openalex.org/W2019913746,"Background Epigenetic markings acquired in early life may have phenotypic consequences later in development through their role in transcriptional regulation with relevance to the developmental origins of diseases including obesity. The goal of this study was to investigate whether DNA methylation levels at birth are associated with body size later in childhood. Principal Findings A study design involving two birth cohorts was used to conduct transcription profiling followed by DNA methylation analysis in peripheral blood. Gene expression analysis was undertaken in 24 individuals whose biological samples and clinical data were collected at a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 12.35 (0.95) years, the upper and lower tertiles of body mass index (BMI) were compared with a mean (SD) BMI difference of 9.86 (2.37) kg/m2. This generated a panel of differentially expressed genes for DNA methylation analysis which was then undertaken in cord blood DNA in 178 individuals with body composition data prospectively collected at a mean (SD) age of 9.83 (0.23) years. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes (>1.2-fold and p<10−4) were analysed to determine DNA methylation levels at 1–3 sites per gene. Five genes were unmethylated and DNA methylation in the remaining 24 genes was analysed using linear regression with bootstrapping. Methylation in 9 of the 24 (37.5%) genes studied was associated with at least one index of body composition (BMI, fat mass, lean mass, height) at age 9 years, although only one of these associations remained after correction for multiple testing (ALPL with height, pCorrected = 0.017). Conclusions DNA methylation patterns in cord blood show some association with altered gene expression, body size and composition in childhood. The observed relationship is correlative and despite suggestion of a mechanistic epigenetic link between in utero life and later phenotype, further investigation is required to establish causality."
https://openalex.org/W2046151267,"Objective Major trauma is characterized by a pro-inflammatory response, followed by an immunosuppression. Recently, in trauma patients, the lack of recovery of monocyte Human Leukocyte Antigen DR (mHLA-DR, a biomarker of ICU-acquired immunosuppression) between days 1–2 and days 3–4 has been demonstrated to be independently associated with sepsis development. The main objective of this study was to determine whether early measurements of IL-6 (interleukin-6) and IL-10 plasma concentrations (as markers of initial severity) could improve, in association with mHLA-DR recovery, the prediction of sepsis occurrence in severe trauma patients. Design Prospective observational study over 24 months in a Trauma ICU at university hospital. Patients Trauma patients with an ISS over 25 and age over 18 were included. Measurements and Main Results mHLA-DR was assessed by flow cytometry, IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations by ELISA. 100 consecutive severely injured patients were monitored (mean ISS 37±10). 37 patients developed sepsis. IL-6 concentrations and slope of mHLA-DR expression between days 1–2 and days 3–4 were significantly different between septic and non-septic patients. IL-10 was not detectable in most patients. After adjustment for usual clinical confounders, when assessed as a pair, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a slope of mHLA-DR expression (days 3–4/days 1–2)≤1.1 and a IL-6 concentration ≥ 67.1 pg/ml remained highly associated with the development of sepsis (adjusted OR 18.4, 95% CI 4.9; 69.4, p = .00002). Conclusions After multivariate regression logistic analysis, when assessed as a pair, a high IL-6 concentration and a persistent mHLA-DR decreased expression were found to be in relation with the development of sepsis with the best predictive value. This study underlines the usefulness of daily monitoring of immune function to identify trauma patients at a high risk of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2039467826,"Aedes aegypti dispersion is the major reason for the increase in dengue transmission in South America. In Brazil, control of this mosquito strongly relies on the use of pyrethroids and organophosphates against adults and larvae, respectively. In consequence, many Ae. aegypti field populations are resistant to these compounds. Resistance has a significant adaptive value in the presence of insecticide treatment. However some selected mechanisms can influence important biological processes, leading to a high fitness cost in the absence of insecticide pressure. We investigated the dynamics of insecticide resistance and its potential fitness cost in five field populations and in a lineage selected for deltamethrin resistance in the laboratory, for nine generations. For all populations the life-trait parameters investigated were larval development, sex ratio, adult longevity, relative amount of ingested blood, rate of ovipositing females, size of egglaying and eggs viability. In the five natural populations, the effects on the life-trait parameters were discrete but directly proportional to resistance level. In addition, several viability parameters were strongly affected in the laboratory selected population compared to its unselected control. Our results suggest that mechanisms selected for organophosphate and pyrethroid resistance caused the accumulation of alleles with negative effects on different life-traits and corroborate the hypothesis that insecticide resistance is associated with a high fitness cost."

For example, they can be used in place of the canonical amino acids (CAAs) to improve the biophysical properties of peptides that target protein interfaces. We describe the incorporation of 114 NCAAs into the protein-modeling suite Rosetta. We describe our methods for building backbone dependent rotamer libraries and the parameterization and construction of a scoring function that can be used to score NCAA containing peptides and proteins. We validate these additions to Rosetta and our NCAA-rotamer libraries by showing that we can improve the binding of a calpastatin derived peptides to calpain-1 by substituting NCAAs for native amino acids using Rosetta.

https://openalex.org/W2102005699,"The photosystem II antenna of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is composed of monomeric and trimeric complexes, the latter encoded by LHCBM genes. We employed artificial microRNA technology to specifically silence the LHCBM2 and LHCBM7 genes, encoding identical mature polypeptides, and the LHCBM1 gene. As a control, we studied the npq5 mutant, deficient in the LHCBM1 protein. The organization of LHCII complexes, functional antenna size, capacity for photoprotection, thermal energy dissipation and state transitions, and resistance to reactive oxygen species was studied in the various genotypes. Silencing of the LHCBM2/7 genes resulted in a decrease of an LHCII protein with an apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa, whereas silencing/lack of LHCBM1 caused the decrease/disappearance of a 23-kDa protein. A decrease in the abundance of trimeric LHCII complexes and in functional antenna size was observed in both LHCBM2/7 and LHCBM1 knockouts. In agreement with previous data, depletion of LHCBM1 decreased the capacity for excess energy dissipation but not the ability to perform state transitions. The opposite was true for LHCBM2/7, implying that this polypeptide has a different functional role from LHCBM1. The abundance of LHCBM1 and LHCBM2/7 is in both cases correlated with resistance to superoxide anion, whereas only LHCBM1 is also involved in singlet oxygen scavenging. These results suggest that different LHCBM components have well defined, non-redundant functions despite their high homology, implying that engineering of LHCBM proteins can be an effective strategy for manipulating the light harvesting system of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii."
https://openalex.org/W1982329697,"Indian Ocean hydrothermal vents are believed to represent a novel biogeographic province, and are host to many novel genera and families of animals, potentially indigenous to Indian Ocean hydrothermal systems. In particular, since its discovery in 2001, much attention has been paid to a so-called ‘scaly-foot’ gastropod because of its unique iron-sulfide-coated dermal sclerites and the chemosynthetic symbioses in its various tissues. Despite increasing interest in the faunal assemblages at Indian Ocean hydrothermal vents, only two hydrothermal vent fields have been investigated in the Indian Ocean. Here we report two newly discovered hydrothermal vent fields, the Dodo and Solitaire fields, which are located in the Central Indian Ridge (CIR) segments 16 and 15, respectively. Chemosynthetic faunal communities at the Dodo field are emaciated in size and composition. In contrast, at the Solitaire field, we observed faunal communities that potentially contained almost all genera found at CIR hydrothermal environments to date, and even identified previously unreported taxa. Moreover, a new morphotype of ‘scaly-foot’ gastropod has been found at the Solitaire field. The newly discovered ‘scaly-foot’ gastropod has similar morphological and anatomical features to the previously reported type that inhabits the Kairei field, and both types of ‘scaly-foot’ gastropods genetically belong to the same species according to analyses of their COI gene and nuclear SSU rRNA gene sequences. However, the new morphotype completely lacks an iron-sulfide coating on the sclerites, which had been believed to be a novel feature restricted to ‘scaly-foot’ gastropods. Our new findings at the two newly discovered hydrothermal vent sites provide important insights into the biodiversity and biogeography of vent-endemic ecosystems in the Indian Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2071363710,"The intracellular parasite Toxoplasma has an indirect life cycle, in which felids are the definitive host. It has been suggested that this parasite developed mechanisms for enhancing its transmission rate to felids by inducing behavioral modifications in the intermediate rodent host. For example, Toxoplasma-infected rodents display a reduction in the innate fear of predator odor. However, animals with Toxoplasma infection acquired in the wild are more often caught in traps, suggesting that there are manipulations of intermediate host behavior beyond those that increase predation by felids. We investigated the behavioral modifications of Toxoplasma-infected mice in environments with exposed versus non-exposed areas, and found that chronically infected mice with brain cysts display a plethora of behavioral alterations. Using principal component analysis, we discovered that most of the behavioral differences observed in cyst-containing animals reflected changes in the microstructure of exploratory behavior and risk/unconditioned fear. We next examined whether these behavioral changes were related to the presence and distribution of parasitic cysts in the brain of chronically infected mice. We found no strong cyst tropism for any particular brain area but found that the distribution of Toxoplasma cysts in the brain of infected animals was not random, and that particular combinations of cyst localizations changed risk/unconditioned fear in the host. These results suggest that brain cysts in animals chronically infected with Toxoplasma alter the fine structure of exploratory behavior and risk/unconditioned fear, which may result in greater capture probability of infected rodents. These data also raise the possibility that selective pressures acted on Toxoplasma to broaden its transmission between intermediate predator hosts, in addition to felid definitive hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2075564792,"Ambient temperature fluctuates diurnally and seasonally. It profoundly influences the timing of flowering in plants. The floral integrator FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) mediates ambient temperature signals via the thermosensory pathway in Arabidopsis flowering. microRNA172 (miR172), which promotes flowering by inducing FT, also responds to changes in ambient temperature. However, it is largely unknown how miR172 integrates ambient temperature signals into the flowering genetic network. Here, we show that Arabidopsis RNA-binding protein FCA promotes the processing of primary microRNA172 transcripts (pri-miR172) in response to changes in ambient temperature. Ambient temperature regulates miR172 biogenesis primarily at the pri-miR172 processing step. miR172 abundance is elevated at 23 °C but not at 16 °C. miR172 accumulation at 23 °C requires functional FCA.

FCA also binds to the primary transcripts of other temperature-responsive miRNAs, such as miR398 and miR399. Notably, levels of FCA mRNAs and proteins increase at 23 °C but remain low at 16 °C, supporting the role of FCA in temperature perception. Our data show that FCA regulation of miR172 processing is an early event in the thermosensory flowering pathway. We propose that the FCA-miR172 regulon provides an adaptive strategy that fine tunes the onset of flowering under fluctuating ambient temperature conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2033292183,"Individual variations in the use of the species niche are an important component of diversity in trophic interactions. A challenge in testing consistency of individual foraging strategy is the repeated collection of information on the same individuals.The foraging strategies of sympatric fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella and A. tropicalis) were examined using the stable isotope signature of serially sampled whiskers. Most whiskers exhibited synchronous δ(13)C and δ(15)N oscillations that correspond to the seal annual movements over the long term (up to 8 years). δ(13)C and δ(15)N values were spread over large ranges, with differences between species, sexes and individuals. The main segregating mechanism operates at the spatial scale. Most seals favored foraging in subantarctic waters (where the Crozet Islands are located) where they fed on myctophids. However, A. gazella dispersed in the Antarctic Zone and A. tropicalis more in the subtropics. Gender differences in annual time budget shape the seal movements. Males that do not perform any parental care exhibited large isotopic oscillations reflecting broad annual migrations, while isotopic values of females confined to a limited foraging range during lactation exhibited smaller changes. Limited inter-individual isotopic variations occurred in female seals and in male A. tropicalis. In contrast, male A. gazella showed large inter-individual variations, with some males migrating repeatedly to high-Antarctic waters where they fed on krill, thus meaning that individual specialization occurred over years.Whisker isotopic signature yields unique long-term information on individual behaviour that integrates the spatial, trophic and temporal dimensions of the ecological niche. The method allows depicting the entire realized niche of the species, including some of its less well-known components such as age-, sex-, individual- and migration-related changes. It highlights intrapopulation heterogeneity in foraging strategies that could have important implications for likely demographic responses to environmental variability."
https://openalex.org/W2151969405,"Angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated vascular smooth muscle cell dysfunction plays a critical role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this process is unclear. We used small RNA deep sequencing to profile Ang II-regulated miRNAs in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and evaluated their role in VSMC dysfunction. Sequencing results revealed several Ang II-responsive miRNAs, and bioinformatics analysis showed that their predicted targets can modulate biological processes relevant to cardiovascular diseases. Further studies with the most highly induced miR-132 and miR-212 cluster (miR-132/212) showed time- and dose-dependent up-regulation of miR-132/212 by Ang II through the Ang II Type 1 receptor. We identified phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) as a novel target of miR-132 and demonstrated that miR-132 induces monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 at least in part via PTEN repression in rat VSMC. Moreover, miR-132 overexpression enhanced cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation via RASA1 (p120 Ras GTPase-activating protein 1) down-regulation, whereas miR-132 inhibition attenuated Ang II-induced CREB activation. Furthermore, miR-132 up-regulation by Ang II required CREB activation, demonstrating a positive feedback loop. Notably, aortas from Ang II-infused mice displayed similar up-regulation of miR-132/212 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, supporting in vivo relevance. In addition, microarray analysis and reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR validation revealed additional novel miR-132 targets among Ang II-down-regulated genes implicated in cell cycle, motility, and cardiovascular functions. These results suggest that miR132/212 can serve as a novel cellular node to fine-tune and amplify Ang II actions in VSMC."
https://openalex.org/W1998299120,"The technology for biodegradation of pig manure by using houseflies in a pilot plant capable of processing 500–700 kg of pig manure per week is described. A single adult cage loaded with 25,000 pupae produced 177.7±32.0 ml of eggs in a 15-day egg-collection period. With an inoculation ratio of 0.4–1.0 ml eggs/kg of manure, the amount of eggs produced by a single cage can suffice for the biodegradation of 178–444 kg of manure. Larval development varied among four different types of pig manure (centrifuged slurry, fresh manure, manure with sawdust, manure without sawdust). Larval survival ranged from 46.9±2.1%, in manure without sawdust, to 76.8±11.9% in centrifuged slurry. Larval development took 6–11 days, depending on the manure type. Processing of 1 kg of wet manure produced 43.9–74.3 g of housefly pupae and the weight of the residue after biodegradation decreased to 0.18–0.65 kg, with marked differences among manure types. Recommendations for the operation of industrial-scale biodegradation facilities are presented and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1969179744,"Despite being internal organs, digestive structures are frequently preserved in Cambrian Lagerstätten. However, the reasons for their fossilisation and their biological implications remain to be thoroughly explored. This is particularly true with arthropods – typically the most diverse fossilised organisms in Cambrian ecosystems – where digestive structures represent an as-yet underexploited alternative to appendage morphology for inferences on their biology. Here we describe the phosphatised digestive structures of three trilobite species from the Cambrian Weeks Formation Lagerstätte (Utah). Their exquisite, three-dimensional preservation reveals unique details on trilobite internal anatomy, such as the position of the mouth and the absence of a differentiated crop. In addition, the presence of paired pygidial organs of an unknown function is reported for the first time. This exceptional material enables exploration of the relationships between gut phosphatisation and the biology of organisms. Indeed, soft-tissue preservation is unusual in these fossils as it is restricted to the digestive structures, which indicates that the gut played a central role in its own phosphatisation. We hypothesize that the gut provided a microenvironment where special conditions could develop and harboured a source of phosphorus. The fact that gut phosphatization has almost exclusively been observed in arthropods could be explained by their uncommon ability to store ions (including phosphorous) in their digestive tissues. However, in some specimens from the Weeks Formation, the phosphatisation extends to the entire digestive system, suggesting that trilobites might have had some biological particularities not observed in modern arthropods. We speculate that one of them might have been an increased capacity for ion storage in the gut tissues, related to the moulting of their heavily-mineralised carapace."
https://openalex.org/W2016920052,"Background Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a severely debilitating disease of unknown pathogenesis consisting of a variety of symptoms including severe fatigue. The objective of the study was to examine the efficacy and safety of a TLR-3 agonist, rintatolimod (Poly I: C12U), in patients with debilitating CFS/ME. Methods and Findings A Phase III prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing twice weekly IV rintatolimod versus placebo was conducted in 234 subjects with long-standing, debilitating CFS/ME at 12 sites. The primary endpoint was the intra-patient change from baseline at Week 40 in exercise tolerance (ET). Secondary endpoints included concomitant drug usage, the Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and Vitality Score (SF 36). Subjects receiving rintatolimod for 40 weeks improved intra-patient placebo-adjusted ET 21.3% (p = 0.047) from baseline in an intention-to-treat analysis. Correction for subjects with reduced dosing compliance increased placebo-adjusted ET improvement to 28% (p = 0.022). The improvement observed represents approximately twice the minimum considered medically significant by regulatory agencies. The rintatolimod cohort vs. placebo also reduced dependence on drugs commonly used by patients in an attempt to alleviate the symptoms of CFS/ME (p = 0.048). Placebo subjects crossed-over to receive rintatolimod demonstrated an intra-patient improvement in ET performance at 24 weeks of 39% (p = 0.04). Rintatolimod at 400 mg twice weekly was generally well-tolerated. Conclusions/Significance Rintatolimod produced objective improvement in ET and a reduction in CFS/ME related concomitant medication usage as well as other secondary outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W2026563563,"Background Later Pleistocene human evolution in East Asia remains poorly understood owing to a scarcity of well described, reliably classified and accurately dated fossils. Southwest China has been identified from genetic research as a hotspot of human diversity, containing ancient mtDNA and Y-DNA lineages, and has yielded a number of human remains thought to derive from Pleistocene deposits. We have prepared, reconstructed, described and dated a new partial skull from a consolidated sediment block collected in 1979 from the site of Longlin Cave (Guangxi Province). We also undertook new excavations at Maludong (Yunnan Province) to clarify the stratigraphy and dating of a large sample of mostly undescribed human remains from the site. Methodology/Principal Findings We undertook a detailed comparison of cranial, including a virtual endocast for the Maludong calotte, mandibular and dental remains from these two localities. Both samples probably derive from the same population, exhibiting an unusual mixture of modern human traits, characters probably plesiomorphic for later Homo, and some unusual features. We dated charcoal with AMS radiocarbon dating and speleothem with the Uranium-series technique and the results show both samples to be from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition: ∼14.3-11.5 ka. Conclusions/Significance Our analysis suggests two plausible explanations for the morphology sampled at Longlin Cave and Maludong. First, it may represent a late-surviving archaic population, perhaps paralleling the situation seen in North Africa as indicated by remains from Dar-es-Soltane and Temara, and maybe also in southern China at Zhirendong. Alternatively, East Asia may have been colonised during multiple waves during the Pleistocene, with the Longlin-Maludong morphology possibly reflecting deep population substructure in Africa prior to modern humans dispersing into Eurasia."
https://openalex.org/W2059856314,"It is unknown how receptor binding by the paramyxovirus attachment proteins (HN, H, or G) triggers the fusion (F) protein to fuse with the plasma membrane for cell entry. H-proteins of the morbillivirus genus consist of a stalk ectodomain supporting a cuboidal head; physiological oligomers consist of non-covalent dimer-of-dimers. We report here the successful engineering of intermolecular disulfide bonds within the central region (residues 91-115) of the morbillivirus H-stalk; a sub-domain that also encompasses the putative F-contacting section (residues 111-118). Remarkably, several intersubunit crosslinks abrogated membrane fusion, but bioactivity was restored under reducing conditions. This phenotype extended equally to H proteins derived from virulent and attenuated morbillivirus strains and was independent of the nature of the contacted receptor. Our data reveal that the morbillivirus H-stalk domain is composed of four tightly-packed subunits. Upon receptor binding, these subunits structurally rearrange, possibly inducing conformational changes within the central region of the stalk, which, in turn, promote fusion. Given that the fundamental architecture appears conserved among paramyxovirus attachment protein stalk domains, we predict that these motions may act as a universal paramyxovirus F-triggering mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2075314033,"In Western music, the major mode is typically used to convey excited, happy, bright or martial emotions, whereas the minor mode typically conveys subdued, sad or dark emotions. Recent studies indicate that the differences between these modes parallel differences between the prosodic and spectral characteristics of voiced speech sounds uttered in corresponding emotional states. Here we ask whether tonality and emotion are similarly linked in an Eastern musical tradition. The results show that the tonal relationships used to express positive/excited and negative/subdued emotions in classical South Indian music are much the same as those used in Western music. Moreover, tonal variations in the prosody of English and Tamil speech uttered in different emotional states are parallel to the tonal trends in music. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the association between musical tonality and emotion is based on universal vocal characteristics of different affective states."
https://openalex.org/W1995129249,"The physiological role of DJ-1, a protein involved in familial Parkinson disease is still controversial. One of the hypotheses proposed indicates a sensor role for oxidative stress, through oxidation of a conserved cysteine residue (Cys-106). The association of DJ-1 mutations with Parkinson disease suggests a loss of function, specific to dopaminergic neurons. Under oxidative conditions, highly reactive dopamine quinones (DAQs) can be produced, which can modify cysteine residues. In cellular models, DJ-1 was found covalently modified by dopamine. We analyzed the structural modifications induced on human DJ-1 by DAQs in vitro. We described the structural perturbations induced by DAQ adduct formation on each of the three cysteine residues of DJ-1 using specific mutants. Cys-53 is the most reactive residue and forms a covalent dimer also in SH-SY5Y DJ-1-transfected cells, but modification of Cys-106 induces the most severe structural perturbations; Cys-46 is not reactive. The relevance of these covalent modifications to the several functions ascribed to DJ-1 is discussed in the context of the cell response to a dopamine-derived oxidative insult."
https://openalex.org/W2032166622,"The pore-forming Ca(2+) channel subunit Ca(V)3.2 mediates a low voltage-activated (T-type) Ca(2+) current (I(CaT)) that contributes pivotally to neuronal and cardiac pacemaker activity. Despite the importance of tightly regulated Ca(V)3.2 levels, the mechanisms regulating its transcriptional dynamics are not well understood. Here, we have identified two key factors that up- and down-regulate the expression of the gene encoding Ca(V)3.2 (Cacna1h). First, we determined the promoter region and observed several stimulatory and inhibitory clusters. Furthermore, we found binding sites for the transcription factor early growth response 1 (Egr1/Zif268/Krox-24) to be highly overrepresented within the Ca(V)3.2 promoter region. mRNA expression analyses and dual-luciferase promoter assays revealed that the Ca(V)3.2 promoter was strongly activated by Egr1 overexpression in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in NG108-15 cells and mouse hippocampi confirmed specific Egr1 binding to the Ca(V)3.2 promoter. Congruently, whole-cell I(CaT) values were significantly larger after Egr1 overexpression. Intriguingly, Egr1-induced activation of the Ca(V)3.2 promoter was effectively counteracted by the repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST). Thus, Egr1 and REST can bi-directionally regulate Ca(V)3.2 promoter activity and mRNA expression and, hence, the size of I(CaT). This mechanism has critical implications for the regulation of neuronal and cardiac Ca(2+) homeostasis under physiological conditions and in episodic disorders such as arrhythmias and epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2140834096,"We show that a fully functional endocannabinoid system is present in primary human melanocytes (normal human epidermal melanocyte cells), including anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol, the respective target receptors (CB1, CB2, and TRPV1), and their metabolic enzymes. We also show that at higher concentrations AEA induces normal human epidermal melanocyte apoptosis (∼3-fold over controls at 5 μm) through a TRPV1-mediated pathway that increases DNA fragmentation and p53 expression. However, at lower concentrations, AEA and other CB1-binding endocannabinoids dose-dependently stimulate melanin synthesis and enhance tyrosinase gene expression and activity (∼3- and ∼2-fold over controls at 1 μm). This CB1-dependent activity was fully abolished by the selective CB1 antagonist SR141716 or by RNA interference of the receptor. CB1 signaling engaged p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases, which in turn activated the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein and the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor. Silencing of tyrosinase or microphthalmia-associated transcription factor further demonstrated the involvement of these proteins in AEA-induced melanogenesis. In addition, CB1 activation did not engage the key regulator of skin pigmentation, cyclic AMP, showing a major difference compared with the regulation of melanogenesis by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone through melanocortin 1 receptor.

CB1 signaling engaged p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases, which in turn activated the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein and the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor. Silencing of tyrosinase or microphthalmia-associated transcription factor further demonstrated the involvement of these proteins in AEA-induced melanogenesis. In addition, CB1 activation did not engage the key regulator of skin pigmentation, cyclic AMP, showing a major difference compared with the regulation of melanogenesis by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone through melanocortin 1 receptor.

Mechoulam R. Novel natural and synthetic ligands of the endocannabinoid system.Curr. Med. Chem. 2010; 17: 1341-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). eCBs bind to type-1 (CB1) and type-2 (CB2) G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (2Howlett A.C. Blume L.C. Dalton G.D.

Receptors and channels targeted by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists.Curr. Med. Chem. 2010; 17: 1360-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, AEA at variance with 2-AG also binds to transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels, which are activated by capsaicin, the pungent ingredient of hot chili pepper, and by noxious stimuli like heat and protons (4Di Marzo V. De Petrocellis L. Endocannabinoids as regulators of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels: a further opportunity to develop new endocannabinoid-based therapeutic drugs.Curr. Med. Chem. 2010; 17: 1430-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The biological activity of eCBs at their receptors is generally subjected to a metabolic control mainly based on (i) Ca2+-dependent biosynthesis catalyzed by N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) for AEA (5Okamoto Y. Tsuboi K. Ueda N. Enzymatic formation of anandamide.Vitam. Horm. 2009; 81: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and by a specific phospholipase C that generates diacylglycerol (DAG), which is then converted to 2-AG by an sn-1-DAG lipase (DAGL), for 2-AG (6Petrosino S. Ligresti A. Di Marzo V. Endocannabinoid chemical biology: a tool for the development of novel therapies.Curr. Opin. Chem.

Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2008; 160: 1-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, eCBs, their target receptors, and metabolic enzymes form the so-called “endocannabinoid system (ECS)” (9Maccarrone M. Dainese E. Oddi S.

In addition to the above listed elements, new components are being discovered as bona fide members of the ECS, including novel biosynthetic or degrading enzymes (10Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F.

To date, many biological activities of ECS have been documented both within the central nervous system and in the periphery (9Maccarrone M. Dainese E. Oddi S.

In particular, growing evidence suggests a key role for eCB signaling in skin biology (14Bíró T. Tóth B.I. Haskó G. Paus R. Pacher P.

Szepietowski J.C. Cannabinoid system in the skin—a possible target for future therapies in dermatology.Exp. Dermatol. 2009; 18: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In fact, eCBs have been shown to inhibit terminal differentiation (cornification) of human keratinocytes through CB1 receptors (19Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Battista N. Gasperi V. Guerrieri P. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agrò A. The endocannabinoid system in human keratinocytes.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33896-33903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The latter receptors inhibited hair shaft elongation and the proliferation of hair matrix keratinocytes in the hair follicle (20Telek A. Bíró T. Bodó E. Tóth B.I. Borbíró I. Kunos G. Paus R. Inhibition of human hair follicle growth by endo- and exocannabinoids.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3534-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CB2 receptors might act as cutaneous nociceptors (21Ibrahim M.M. Porreca F. Lai J. Albrecht P.J. Rice F.L. Khodorova A. Davar G. Makriyannis A. Vanderah T.W. Mata H.P. Malan T.P.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11141-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas in human sebocytes, they up-regulate the expression of key genes involved in lipid synthesis in a paracrine/autocrine manner (23Dobrosi N. Tóth B.I. Nagy G. Dózsa A. Géczy T. Nagy L. Zouboulis C.C. Paus R. Kovács L. Bíró T. Endocannabinoids enhance lipid synthesis and apoptosis of human sebocytes via cannabinoid receptor-2-mediated signaling.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3685-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a protective role of ECS has been reported in contact allergy of the skin (24Karsak M. Gaffal E. Date R. Wang-Eckhardt L. Rehnelt J. Petrosino S. Starowicz K. Steuder R. Schlicker E. Cravatt B. Mechoulam R. Buettner R. Werner S. Di Marzo V. Tüting T. Zimmer A. Attenuation of allergic contact dermatitis through the endocannabinoid system.Science. 2007; 316: 1494-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Despite significant research on the role of eCB signaling in keratinocytes, no data are yet available on the presence and potential role of ECS in primary human melanocytes. Previous studies have shown the mRNA and protein expression of CB1 and CB2 in melanoma cell lines of murine and human origin (25Blázquez C. Carracedo A. Barrado L. Real P.J. Fernández-Luna J.L.

The antimitogenic effect of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55212-2 on human melanoma cells is mediated by the membrane lipid raft.Cancer Lett. 2011; 310: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and of CB1 in nontumorigenic, immortalized melanocytic cell lines (25Blázquez C. Carracedo A. Barrado L. Real P.J. Fernández-Luna J.L. Velasco G. Malumbres M. Guzmán M. Cannabinoid receptors as novel targets for the treatment of melanoma.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2633-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, endogenous expression of TRPV1 channels has been documented in cultured human melanocytes (27Choi T.Y. Park S.Y. Jo J.Y. Kang G. Park J.B. Kim J.G. Hong S.G. Kim C.D. Lee J.H. Yoon T.J. Endogenous expression of TRPV1 channel in cultured human melanocytes.J. Dermatol. Sci. 2009; 56: 128-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Primary human melanocytes, which are a truly physiological model, are derived from the neural crest cells (28Bronner-Fraser M. Fraser S.E. Cell lineage analysis reveals multipotency of some avian neural crest cells.Nature. 1988; 335: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and are responsible for skin pigmentation (melanogenesis). In the basal layer of the skin, which separates dermis and epidermis, each melanocyte is surrounded by ∼35 keratinocytes, forming the so-called “epidermal melanin unit” (29Smit N. Vicanova J. Pavel S. The hunt for natural skin whitening agents.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2009; 10: 5326-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This tight association allows the transport of melanin from melanocytes to the overlaying keratinocytes, e.g. upon exposure of the latter cells to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation (30Abdel-Malek Z.A. Kadekaro A.L. Swope V.B. Stepping up melanocytes to the challenge of UV exposure.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2010; 23: 171-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Liu J.J. Fisher D.E. Lighting a path to pigmentation: mechanisms of MITF induction by UV.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2010; 23: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In fact, melanin production mediated by the enzyme tyrosinase (32Simon J.D. Peles D. Wakamatsu K. Ito S. Current challenges in understanding melanogenesis: bridging chemistry, biological control, morphology, and function.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2009; 22: 563-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and delivery to keratinocytes is the main skin photoprotective mechanism as it prevents UV-induced DNA damage in the epidermis (30Abdel-Malek Z.A.

Lighting a path to pigmentation: mechanisms of MITF induction by UV.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2010; 23: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here we sought to ascertain whether primary human melanocytes (normal human epidermal melanocyte (NHEM) cells) have the components of the ECS by analyzing them at the mRNA, protein, and functional level. Then we investigated the possible modulation of NHEM cell survival and death and of melanin synthesis by eCBs. In this context, we checked the effect of eCBs on the expression of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a protein of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family, regarded as a master regulator of vertebrate melanogenesis (33Johnson S.L.

Primary human melanocytes (NHEMs) from foreskin (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) were grown for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in M2 melanocyte growth medium (Promocell) according to the manufacturer's instructions. AEA and related substances were added directly to culture medium, and vehicles alone were added to controls. Twenty-four hours after each treatment, cell viability was measured by trypan blue dye exclusion as reported (19Maccarrone M. Di Rienzo M. Battista N. Gasperi V. Guerrieri P. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agrò A.

Apoptosis was also quantified by measuring mRNA expression of p53, a typical marker of programmed cell death (35Pasquariello N. Catanzaro G. Marzano V. Amadio D. Barcaroli D. Oddi S. Federici G.

RNA was extracted from NHEM cells using the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) as suggested by the manufacturer. qRT-PCR assays were performed using the SuperScript III Platinum Two-Step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). One microgram of total RNA was used to produce cDNA with 10 units/μl SuperScript III reverse transcriptase in the presence of 2 units/μl RNaseOUT, 1.25 μm oligo(dT)20, 1.25 ng/μl random hexamers, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTP mixture, and diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water.

The target transcripts were amplified using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Human primers for CB1, CB2, TRPV1, NAPE-PLD, FAAH, DAGL, MAGL, p53, and β-actin were as reported (35Pasquariello N. Catanzaro G. Marzano V. Amadio D. Barcaroli D. Oddi S. Federici G. Urbani A.

For Western blotting, equal amounts of protein (25 μg/lane) were loaded onto 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride sheets (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dried milk and 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h and then incubated with anti-CB1 (1:100), anti-CB2 (1:200), anti-TRPV1 (1:200), anti-NAPE-PLD (1:100), anti-FAAH (1:500), anti-DAGL (1:1000), anti-MAGL (1:200), anti-MITF (1:200), anti-TYR (1:100), or anti-β-actin (1:100) antibodies. Then membranes were rinsed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:2000) in blocking solution. Detection of the immunoreactive bands was performed in a West Dura Chemiluminescence System (Pierce) using as positive controls homogenates (25 μg of protein/well) of mouse brain (for CB1, NAPE-PLD, FAAH, DAGL, and MAGL), mouse spleen (for CB2), or human HeLa cells (for TRPV1) as reported (36Francavilla F.

https://openalex.org/W2063118314,"Objectives Several recent studies report the presence of a specific EEG pattern named Thalamocortical Dysrhythmia (TCD) in patients with severe chronic neurogenic pain. This is of major interest since so far no neuroscientific indicator of chronic pain could be identified. We investigated whether a TCD-like pattern could be found in patients with moderate chronic back pain, and we compared patients with neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain components. We furthermore assessed the presence of psychopathology and the degree of psychological functioning and examined whether the strength of the TCD-related EEG markers is correlated with psychological symptoms and pain ratings. Design Controlled clinical trial with age and sex matched healthy controls. Methods Spontaneous EEG was recorded in 37 back pain patients and 37 healthy controls. Results We were not able to observe a statistically significant TCD effect in the EEG data of the whole patient group, but a subsample of patients with evidence for root damage showed a trend in this direction. Pain patients showed markedly increased psychopathology. In addition, patients' ratings of pain intensity within the last 1 to 12 months showed strong correlations with EEG power, while psychopathology was correlated to the peak frequency. Conclusion Out of several possible interpretations the most likely conclusion is that only patients with severe pain as well as root lesions with consecutive thalamic deafferentation develop the typical TCD pattern. Our primary method of defining ‘neuropathic pain’ could not reliably determine if such a deafferentation was present. Nevertheless the analysis of a specific subsample as well as correlations between pain ratings, psychopathology and EEG power and peak frequency give some support to the TCD concept.

https://openalex.org/W2134927569,"In view of the rapid extension of offshore wind farms, there is an urgent need to improve our knowledge on possible adverse effects of underwater sound generated by pile-driving. Mortality and injuries have been observed in fish exposed to loud impulse sounds, but knowledge on the sound levels at which (sub-)lethal effects occur is limited for juvenile and adult fish, and virtually non-existent for fish eggs and larvae. A device was developed in which fish larvae can be exposed to underwater sound. It consists of a rigid-walled cylindrical chamber driven by an electro-dynamical sound projector. Samples of up to 100 larvae can be exposed simultaneously to a homogeneously distributed sound pressure and particle velocity field. Recorded pile-driving sounds could be reproduced accurately in the frequency range between 50 and 1000 Hz, at zero to peak pressure levels up to 210 dB re 1µPa(2) (zero to peak pressures up to 32 kPa) and single pulse sound exposure levels up to 186 dB re 1µPa(2)s. The device was used to examine lethal effects of sound exposure in common sole (Solea solea) larvae. Different developmental stages were exposed to various levels and durations of pile-driving sound. The highest cumulative sound exposure level applied was 206 dB re 1µPa(2)s, which corresponds to 100 strikes at a distance of 100 m from a typical North Sea pile-driving site. The results showed no statistically significant differences in mortality between exposure and control groups at sound exposure levels which were well above the US interim criteria for non-auditory tissue damage in fish. Although our findings cannot be extrapolated to fish larvae in general, as interspecific differences in vulnerability to sound exposure may occur, they do indicate that previous assumptions and criteria may need to be revised."
https://openalex.org/W2170832191,"Vision provides a primary sensory input for food perception. It raises expectations on taste and nutritional value and drives acceptance or rejection. So far, the impact of visual food cues varying in energy content on subsequent taste integration remains unexplored. Using electrical neuroimaging, we assessed whether high- and low-calorie food cues differentially influence the brain processing and perception of a subsequent neutral electric taste. When viewing high-calorie food images, participants reported the subsequent taste to be more pleasant than when low-calorie food images preceded the identical taste. Moreover, the taste-evoked neural activity was stronger in the bilateral insula and the adjacent frontal operculum (FOP) within 100 ms after taste onset when preceded by high- versus low-calorie cues. A similar pattern evolved in the anterior cingulate (ACC) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) around 180 ms, as well as, in the right insula, around 360 ms. The activation differences in the OFC correlated positively with changes in taste pleasantness, a finding that is an accord with the role of the OFC in the hedonic evaluation of taste. Later activation differences in the right insula likely indicate revaluation of interoceptive taste awareness. Our findings reveal previously unknown mechanisms of cross-modal, visual-gustatory, sensory interactions underlying food evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2051691585,"In their widely noticed study, Gergely, Bekkering, and Király (2002) showed that 14-month-old infants imitated an unusual action only if the model freely chose to perform this action and not if the choice of the action could be ascribed to external constraints. They attributed this kind of selective imitation to the infants' capacity of understanding the principle of rational action. In the current paper, we present evidence that a simpler approach of perceptual distraction may be more appropriate to explain their results. When we manipulated the saliency of context stimuli in the two original conditions, the results were exactly opposite to what rational imitation predicts. Based on these findings, we reject the claim that the notion of rational action plays a key role in selective imitation in 14-month-olds."
https://openalex.org/W2047501253,"Cross-reactive dengue virus (DENV) antibodies directed against the envelope (E) and precursor membrane (prM) proteins are believed to contribute to the development of severe dengue disease by facilitating antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. We and others recently demonstrated that anti-prM antibodies render essentially non-infectious immature DENV infectious in Fcγ-receptor-expressing cells. Immature DENV particles are abundantly present in standard (st) virus preparations due to inefficient processing of prM to M during virus maturation. Structural analysis has revealed that the E protein is exposed in immature particles and this prompted us to investigate whether antibodies to E render immature particles infectious. To this end, we analyzed the enhancing properties of 27 anti-E antibodies directed against distinct structural domains. Of these, 23 bound to immature particles, and 15 enhanced infectivity of immature DENV in a furin-dependent manner. The significance of these findings was subsequently tested in vivo using the well-established West Nile virus (WNV) mouse model. Remarkably, mice injected with immature WNV opsonized with anti-E mAbs or immune serum produced a lethal infection in a dose-dependent manner, whereas in the absence of antibody immature WNV virions caused no morbidity or mortality. Furthermore, enhancement infection studies with standard (st) DENV preparations opsonized with anti-E mAbs in the presence or absence of furin inhibitor revealed that prM-containing particles present within st virus preparations contribute to antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Taken together, our results support the notion that antibodies against the structural proteins prM and E both can promote pathogenesis by enhancing infectivity of prM-containing immature and partially mature flavivirus particles."
https://openalex.org/W2036425569,"Elucidating the complex cell dynamics (divisions, movement, morphological changes, etc.) underlying embryonic development and adult tissue regeneration requires an efficient means to track cells with high fidelity in space and time. To satisfy this criterion, we developed a transgenic zebrafish line, called PhOTO, that allows photoconvertible optical tracking of nuclear and membrane dynamics in vivo.PhOTO zebrafish ubiquitously express targeted blue fluorescent protein (FP) Cerulean and photoconvertible FP Dendra2 fusions, allowing for instantaneous, precise targeting and tracking of any number of cells using Dendra2 photoconversion while simultaneously monitoring global cell behavior and morphology. Expression persists through adulthood, making the PhOTO zebrafish an excellent tool for studying tissue regeneration: after tail fin amputation and photoconversion of a ∼100 µm stripe along the cut area, marked differences seen in how cells contribute to the new tissue give detailed insight into the dynamic process of regeneration. Photoconverted cells that contributed to the regenerate were separated into three distinct populations corresponding to the extent of cell division 7 days after amputation, and a subset of cells that divided the least were organized into an evenly spaced, linear orientation along the length of the newly regenerating fin.PhOTO zebrafish have wide applicability for lineage tracing at the systems-level in the early embryo as well as in the adult, making them ideal candidate tools for future research in development, traumatic injury and regeneration, cancer progression, and stem cell behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2073182408,"von Willebrand factor (vWF) mediates platelet adhesion and thrombus formation via its interaction with the platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP)Ibα. We have analyzed two A1A2A3 tri-domain proteins to demonstrate that the amino acid sequence, Gln(1238)-Glu(1260), in the N-terminal flanking region of the A1 domain, together with the association between the A domains, modulates vWF-GPIbα binding and platelet activation under shear stress. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, we have described that sequence Gln(1238)-Glu(1260) stabilizes the structural conformation of the A1A2A3 tri-domain complex. The structural stabilization imparted by this particular region inhibits the binding capacity of the tri-domain protein for GPIbα. Deletion of this region causes a conformational change in the A1 domain that increases binding to GPIbα. Only the truncated protein was capable of effectively blocking ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. To determine the capacity of activating platelets via the interaction with GPIbα, whole blood was incubated with the N-terminal region truncated or intact tri-A domain protein prior to perfusion over a fibrin(ogen)-coated surface. At a high shear rate of 1,500 s(-1), platelets from blood containing the truncated protein rapidly bound, covering >90% of the fibrin(ogen) surface area, whereas the intact tri-A domain protein induced platelets to bind <10%. The results obtained in this study ascertain the relevant role of the structural association between the N-terminal flanking region of the A1 domain (amino acids Gln(1238)-Glu(1260)) and the A1A2A3 domain complex in preventing vWF to bind spontaneously to GPIbα in solution under high shear forces."
https://openalex.org/W2122300380,"Background Certain facial configurations are believed to be associated with distinct affective meanings (i.e. basic facial expressions), and such associations are common across cultures (i.e. universality of facial expressions). However, recently, many studies suggest that various types of contextual information, rather than facial configuration itself, are important factor for facial emotion perception. Methodology/Principal Findings To examine systematically how contextual information influences individuals’ facial emotion perception, the present study estimated direct observers’ perceptual thresholds for detecting negative facial expressions via a forced-choice psychophysical procedure using faces embedded in various emotional contexts. We additionally measured the individual differences in affective information-processing tendency (BIS/BAS) as a possible factor that may determine the extent to which contextual information on facial emotion perception is used. It was found that contextual information influenced observers' perceptual thresholds for facial emotion. Importantly, individuals’ affective-information tendencies modulated the extent to which they incorporated context information into their facial emotion perceptions. Conclusions/Significance The findings of this study suggest that facial emotion perception not only depends on facial configuration, but the context in which the face appears as well. This contextual influence appeared differently with individual’s characteristics of information processing. In summary, we conclude that individual character traits, as well as facial configuration and the context in which a face appears, need to be taken into consideration regarding facial emotional perception."
https://openalex.org/W2042170099,"Background Delivery of a small for gestational age (SGA) infant has been associated with increased maternal risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD). It is uncertain whether giving birth to SGA infant is a specific determinant of later IHD, independent of other risk factors, or a marker of general poor health. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between delivery of a SGA infant and maternal risk for IHD in relation to traditional IHD risk factors. Methods and Findings Risk of maternal IHD was evaluated in a population based cross-sectional study of 6,608 women with a prior live term birth who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999–2006), a probability sample of the U.S. population. Sequence of events was determined from age at last live birth and at diagnosis of IHD. Delivery of a SGA infant is strongly associated with greater maternal risk for IHD (age adjusted OR; 95% CI: 1.8; 1.2, 2.9; p = 0.012). The association was independent of the family history of IHD, stroke, hypertension and diabetes (family history-adjusted OR; 95% CI: 1.9; 1.2, 3.0; p = 0.011) as well as other risk factors for IHD (risk factor-adjusted OR; 95% CI: 1.7; 1.1, 2.7; p = 0.025). Delivery of a SGA infant was associated with earlier onset of IHD and preceded it by a median of 30 (interquartile range: 20, 36) years. Conclusions Giving birth to a SGA infant is strongly and independently associated with IHD and a potential risk factor that precedes IHD by decades. A pregnancy that produces a SGA infant may induce long-term cardiovascular changes that increase risk for IHD."

The covalent modification of histones is important for establishment of static or dynamic chromatin domains, thereby providing an important step for regulation of gene expression. Most of these covalent modifications, which include methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, have been mapped to the histone tails that extend outside of the core nucleosome structure. Particular modifications are preferentially localized in specific regions of the genome and confer the functional characteristics of different chromatin domains.

Only some of the APT subunits are essential for viability; in addition to Swd2, they include Pti1 and the phosphatases Glc7 and Ssu72. We show here that Swd2 is normally required to bring APT to snoRNA genes. This recruiting function likely contributes to the requirement for Swd2 because swd2Δ lethality can be suppressed by overexpression of the APT subunit Ref2 (26Cheng H. He X. Moore C.

Termination at snoRNAs and other cryptic, noncoding transcripts is primarily mediated by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 complex (31Steinmetz E.J. Conrad N.K. Brow D.A. Corden J.L.

Biol. 2008; 15: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), as well as through recognition of specific RNA sequences. Termination is presumed to be mediated by the helicase activity of Sen1. Interestingly, swd2Δ lethality is also suppressed by expression of a Sen1 fragment that lacks Sen1 helicase activity (30Nedea E. Nalbant D. Xia D. Theoharis N.T. Suter B. Richardson C.J. Tatchell K. Kislinger T. Greenblatt J.F. Nagy P.L. The Glc7 phosphatase subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor is essential for transcription termination on snoRNA genes.Mol.

The relationship between APT and the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 complex remains unclear. Here we probe the role of COMPASS and Swd2 in modulating early events during transcription that affect the APT complex and usage of the early snoRNA termination pathway. Although deletion of SET1 does not cause major changes in recruitment of the RNApII initiation complex, chromatin immunoprecipitation shows higher cross-linking levels of CTD serine 5 phosphorylation and the large subunit of TFIIE. Cells lacking SET1 are also defective in recruitment of COMPASS, including the Swd2 component. Despite the reduction of Swd2 levels, other components of the APT and Nrd1 complexes are recruited normally. Surprisingly, the Swd2 protein is no longer required for viability or for recruitment of the APT complex in the absence of Set1. We propose a model in which COMPASS and the APT complex, both aided by Swd2, may sequentially occupy overlapping space.

Swd2 degron strains were constructed as described (26Cheng H. He X. Moore C.

FLAG immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG-agarose beads, and TAP tag precipitation was performed using IgG-Sepharose beads. Binding was done overnight at 4 °C in FA lysis buffer containing 275 mm NaCl. Precipitates were washed with the same buffer, once with FA lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, once with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and once with TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Precipitated DNA was analyzed for specific gene sequences by PCR. PCR conditions were 60 s at 94 °C, followed by 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C, followed by 2 min at 72 °C. The sequences of oligonucleotides used are listed in supplemental Table S2. Signals for histone modifications were normalized to total H3, and COMPASS complex component signals were normalized to untagged strains. In all other cases, signals were normalized to input samples and a nontranscribed control region. Where indicated, signals were expressed relative to Rpb3 ChIP levels. RNA was extracted from cells with hot water-equilibrated phenol. First strand cDNA was prepared using 1 μg of total RNA treated with DNase I, Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and gene-specific primers (supplemental Table S3). One-quarter of the cDNA was used for quantitative PCR using a Roche Lightcycler 480 amplification or for standard PCR and analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 50 ml of exponentially growing cultures. The cell pellets were resuspended in breaking buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm sorbitol, 600 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA) with the addition of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, anti-pain, 1 mm PMSF). The cells were disrupted by vortexing with acid-washed glass beads for five 30-s pulses. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant (whole cell extract) was used for protein analysis. 20 μg of whole cell extract were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed for TAP tag or TBP as a loading control. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged COMPASS subunits was performed on the model genes PMA1 and RPS13 (Fig. 1A). As expected, all components of the COMPASS complex show a peak at the 5′ region of the gene (Fig. 1B). Consistent with H3 K4 methylation throughout the entire gene, ChIP signals above background for all components were seen with all PCR primers (Fig. 1B). However, the higher levels of H3K4 methylation (H3K4me3 and H3K4me2) correlated with the strongest cross-linking of COMPASS. It has been proposed that the peak of H3K4me3 at active promoters (supplemental Fig. S1A) is due to interaction of COMPASS with the CTD of the RNApII subunit Rpb1. More specifically, the basal transcription factor TFIIH phosphorylates the CTD at serine 5 of the YSPTSPS repeat at the promoter, and the TFIIH kinase is necessary for efficient COMPASS recruitment (13Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Targeted recruitment of Set1 histone methylase by elongating Pol II provides a localized mark and memory of recent transcriptional activity.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Swd2, the COMPASS subunit that is also a component of the APT termination complex, continues to cross-link strongly downstream and has a second peak at the 3′ end (Fig. 1B and Ref. 28Nedea E. He X. Kim M. Pootoolal J. Zhong G. Canadien V. Hughes T. Buratowski S. Moore C.L. Greenblatt J. Organization and function of APT, a subcomplex of the yeast cleavage and polyadenylation factor involved in the formation of mRNA and small nucleolar RNA 3′-ends.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33000-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The large Set1 protein has been proposed to be the platform upon which the other COMPASS components assemble. Consistent with this idea, deletion of Set1 eliminates the ChIP signal of all COMPASS components except for Swd2 (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1B). This loss of cross-linking was not due to degradation of the proteins, because the levels of all the components were similar in SET1 and set1Δ cells (Fig. 1D). Although the levels of Spp1, Swd3, and some others do show a slight decrease in the set1Δ background, this was insufficient to explain their complete absence at transcribing genes. Therefore, Set1 is required both to methylate H3K4 and to recruit the other COMPASS subunits. Although cells lacking SET1 exhibit changes in the transcription levels of some genes (12Boa S. Coert C.

Methylation of H3K4 is required for inheritance of active transcriptional states.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 397-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Deletion of SET1 also confers sensitivity to the drug 6AU (20Kim T. Buratowski S.

Therefore, we speculated that H3K4 methylation might be important for the correct kinetics of early transcription. To explore this possibility, ChIP against the Rpb3 subunit of RNApII was carried out. Overall levels of polymerase cross-linking were not strongly affected by set1Δ at the genes tested (Fig. 2A), showing only a modest reduction in the promoter signal in the PMA1 gene. In contrast, a significant increase in the ChIP levels of CTD phosphorylation was observed in set1Δ cells, particularly for serines 5 and 7 (Fig. 2B). These two modifications are strongest near the 5′ end of genes and are both deposited by the TFIIH-associated kinase Kin28 (40Akhtar M.S. Heidemann M. Tietjen J.R. Zhang D.W. Chapman R.D. Eick D.

To test for biological relevance of the increased CTD serine 5 phosphorylation, several experiments were performed. Temperature-sensitive phenotypes caused by mutations in the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 are suppressed by the overexpression of Kin28 (43Demae M. Murata Y. Hisano M. Haitani Y. Shima J. Takagi H.

https://openalex.org/W2053218712,"Early steps of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis require a large set of ribosome biogenesis factors which transiently interact with nascent rRNA precursors (pre-rRNA). Most likely, concomitant with that initial contacts between ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and ribosome precursors (pre-ribosomes) are established which are converted into robust interactions between pre-rRNA and r-proteins during the course of ribosome maturation. Here we analysed the interrelationship between r-protein assembly events and the transient interactions of ribosome biogenesis factors with early pre-ribosomal intermediates termed 90S pre-ribosomes or small ribosomal subunit (SSU) processome in yeast cells. We observed that components of the SSU processome UTP-A and UTP-B sub-modules were recruited to early pre-ribosomes independently of all tested r-proteins. On the other hand, groups of SSU processome components were identified whose association with early pre-ribosomes was affected by specific r-protein assembly events in the head-platform interface of the SSU. One of these components, Noc4p, appeared to be itself required for robust incorporation of r-proteins into the SSU head domain. Altogether, the data reveal an emerging network of specific interrelationships between local r-protein assembly events and the functional interactions of SSU processome components with early pre-ribosomes. They point towards some of these components being transient primary pre-rRNA in vivo binders and towards a role for others in coordinating the assembly of major SSU domains."
https://openalex.org/W2056111332,"The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) has been linked to the underlying neurobiology of aggressive behavior, particularly with evidence from studies in animals and humans. However, the underlying neurobiology of aggression remains unclear in the context of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a disorder known to be associated with aggression and impulsivity. We investigated the effects of acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), and the resulting diminished central nervous serotonergic neurotransmission, on reactive aggression in healthy controls and adults with ADHD.Twenty male patients with ADHD and twenty healthy male controls were subjected to ATD with an amino acid (AA) beverage that lacked tryptophan (TRP, the physiological precursor of 5-HT) and a TRP-balanced AA beverage (BAL) in a double-blind, within-subject crossover-study over two study days. We assessed reactive aggression 3.25 hours after ATD/BAL intake using a point-subtraction aggression game (PSAG) in which participants played for points against a fictitious opponent. Point subtraction was taken as a measure for reactive aggression. Lowered rates of reactive aggression were found in the ADHD group under ATD after low provocation (LP), with controls showing the opposite effect. In patients with ADHD, trait-impulsivity was negatively correlated with the ATD effect on reactive aggression after LP. Statistical power was limited due to large standard deviations observed in the data on point subtraction, which may limit the use of this particular paradigm in adults with ADHD.Together with previous findings, the data provide preliminary evidence of an inverse association between trait-impulsivity and the ATD effect on reactive aggression after LP (as assessed by the PSAG) in patients with ADHD and that this relationship can be found in both adolescents and adults. Because of limited statistical power larger sample sizes are needed to find main effects of ATD/BAL administration on reactive aggression in adults with ADHD."

To understand genetic diversity among serogroup B strains in Brazil, we selected a nationally representative sample of clinical disease isolates from 2004, and a temporally representative sample for the state of São Paulo (1988–2006) for study (n = 372). Methods We performed multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and sequence analysis of five outer membrane protein (OMP) genes, including novel vaccine targets fHbp and nadA. Results In 2004, strain B:4:P1.15,19 clonal complex ST-32/ET-5 (cc32) predominated throughout Brazil; regional variation in MLST sequence type (ST), fetA, and porB was significant but diversity was limited for nadA and fHbp. Between 1988 and 1996, the São Paulo isolates shifted from clonal complex ST-41/44/Lineage 3 (cc41/44) to cc32. OMP variation was associated with but not predicted by cc or ST. Overall, fHbp variant 1/subfamily B was present in 80% of isolates and showed little diversity. The majority of nadA were similar to reference allele 1. Conclusions A predominant serogroup B lineage has circulated in Brazil for over a decade with significant regional and temporal diversity in ST, fetA, and porB, but not in nadA and fHbp."
https://openalex.org/W2075074570,"Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are widespread among the plasmids and genomes of bacteria and archaea. This work reports the first description of a functional TA system in Streptomyces that is identical in two species routinely used in the laboratory: Streptomyces lividans and S. coelicolor. The described system belongs to the YefM/YoeB family and has a considerable similarity to Escherichia coli YefM/YoeB (about 53% identity and 73% similarity). Lethal effect of the S. lividans putative toxin (YoeBsl) was observed when expressed alone in E. coli SC36 (MG1655 ΔyefM-yoeB). However, no toxicity was obtained when co-expression of the antitoxin and toxin (YefM/YoeBsl) was carried out. The toxic effect was also observed when the yoeBsl was cloned in multicopy in the wild-type S. lividans or in a single copy in a S. lividans mutant, in which this TA system had been deleted. The S. lividans YefM/YoeBsl complex, purified from E. coli, binds with high affinity to its own promoter region but not to other three random selected promoters from Streptomyces. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the expression of yoeBsl in E. coli blocks translation initiation processing mRNA at three bases downstream of the initiation codon after 2 minutes of induction. These results indicate that the mechanism of action is identical to that of YoeB from E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1988359978,"Anti-predator behaviors are essential to survival for most animals. The neural bases of such behaviors, however, remain largely unknown. Although honeybees commonly use their stingers to counterattack predators, the Japanese honeybee (Apis cerana japonica) uses a different strategy to fight against the giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia japonica). Instead of stinging the hornet, Japanese honeybees form a “hot defensive bee ball” by surrounding the hornet en masse, killing it with heat. The European honeybee (A. mellifera ligustica), on the other hand, does not exhibit this behavior, and their colonies are often destroyed by a hornet attack. In the present study, we attempted to analyze the neural basis of this behavior by mapping the active brain regions of Japanese honeybee workers during the formation of a hot defensive bee ball. First, we identified an A. cerana homolog (Acks = Apis cerana kakusei) of kakusei, an immediate early gene that we previously identified from A. mellifera, and showed that Acks has characteristics similar to kakusei and can be used to visualize active brain regions in A. cerana. Using Acks as a neural activity marker, we demonstrated that neural activity in the mushroom bodies, especially in Class II Kenyon cells, one subtype of mushroom body intrinsic neurons, and a restricted area between the dorsal lobes and the optic lobes was increased in the brains of Japanese honeybee workers involved in the formation of a hot defensive bee ball. In addition, workers exposed to 46°C heat also exhibited Acks expression patterns similar to those observed in the brains of workers involved in the formation of a hot defensive bee ball, suggesting that the neural activity observed in the brains of workers involved in the hot defensive bee ball mainly reflects thermal stimuli processing."
https://openalex.org/W2046845857,"Functional annotation of uncharacterized genes is the main focus of computational methods in the post genomic era. These tools search for similarity between proteins on the premise that those sharing sequence or structural motifs usually perform related functions, and are thus particularly useful for membrane proteins. Early responsive to dehydration (ERD) genes are rapidly induced in response to dehydration stress in a variety of plant species. In the present work we characterized function of Brassica juncea ERD4 gene using computational approaches. The ERD4 protein of unknown function possesses ubiquitous DUF221 domain (residues 312–634) and is conserved in all plant species. We suggest that the protein is localized in chloroplast membrane with at least nine transmembrane helices. We detected a globular domain of 165 amino acid residues (183–347) in plant ERD4 proteins and expect this to be posited inside the chloroplast. The structural-functional annotation of the globular domain was arrived at using fold recognition methods, which suggested in its sequence presence of two tandem RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domains each folded into βαββαβ topology. The structure based sequence alignment with the known RNA-binding proteins revealed conservation of two non-canonical ribonucleoprotein sub-motifs in both the putative RNA-recognition domains of the ERD4 protein. The function of highly conserved ERD4 protein may thus be associated with its RNA-binding ability during the stress response. This is the first functional annotation of ERD4 family of proteins that can be useful in designing experiments to unravel crucial aspects of stress tolerance mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1981527181,"Background Development of novel synthetic promoters with enhanced regulatory activity is of great value for a diverse range of plant biotechnology applications. Methodology Using the Figwort mosaic virus full-length transcript promoter (F) and the sub-genomic transcript promoter (FS) sequences, we generated two single shuffled promoter libraries (LssF and LssFS), two multiple shuffled promoter libraries (LmsFS-F and LmsF-FS), two hybrid promoters (FuasFScp and FSuasFcp) and two hybrid-shuffled promoter libraries (LhsFuasFScp and LhsFSuasFcp). Transient expression activities of approximately 50 shuffled promoter clones from each of these libraries were assayed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) protoplasts. It was observed that most of the shuffled promoters showed reduced activity compared to the two parent promoters (F and FS) and the CaMV35S promoter. In silico studies (computer simulated analyses) revealed that the reduced promoter activities of the shuffled promoters could be due to their higher helical stability. On the contrary, the hybrid promoters FuasFScp and FSuasFcp showed enhanced activities compared to F, FS and CaMV 35S in both transient and transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Arabidopsis plants. Northern-blot and qRT-PCR data revealed a positive correlation between transcription and enzymatic activity in transgenic tobacco plants expressing hybrid promoters. Histochemical/X-gluc staining of whole transgenic seedlings/tissue-sections and fluorescence images of ImaGene Green™ treated roots and stems expressing the GUS reporter gene under the control of the FuasFScp and FSuasFcp promoters also support the above findings. Furthermore, protein extracts made from protoplasts expressing the human defensin (HNP-1) gene driven by hybrid promoters showed enhanced antibacterial activity compared to the CaMV35S promoter. Significance/Conclusion Both shuffled and hybrid promoters developed in the present study can be used as molecular tools to study the regulation of ectopic gene expression in plants."

Comparative analysis of the crystal structures of H-2K(b)/gp34 and H-2K(b)/NY-gp34 demonstrated that nitrotyrosination of p3Y in gp34 abrogates a hydrogen bond interaction formed with the H-2K(b) residue E152. As a consequence the conformation of the TCR-interacting E152 was profoundly altered in H-2K(b)/NY-gp34 when compared to H-2K(b)/gp34, thereby modifying the surface of the nitrotyrosinated MHC complex. Furthermore, nitrotyrosination of gp34 resulted in structural over-packing, straining the overall conformation and considerably reducing the stability of the H-2K(b)/NY-gp34 MHC complex when compared to H-2K(b)/gp34. Our structural analysis also indicates that nitrotyrosination of the main TCR-interacting residue p4Y in gp33 abrogates recognition of H-2D(b)/gp33-NY complexes by H-2D(b)/gp33-specific T cells through sterical hindrance. In conclusion, this study provides the first structural and biochemical evidence for how MHC class I-restricted nitrotyrosinated neoantigens may enable viral escape and break immune tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2052871251,"Background Targeting conserved proteins of bacteria through antibacterial medications has resulted in both the development of resistant strains and changes to human health by destroying beneficial microbes which eventually become breeding grounds for the evolution of resistances. Despite the availability of more than 800 genomes sequences, 430 pathways, 4743 enzymes, 9257 metabolic reactions and protein (three-dimensional) 3D structures in bacteria, no pathogen-specific computational drug target identification tool has been developed. Methods A web server, UniDrug-Target, which combines bacterial biological information and computational methods to stringently identify pathogen-specific proteins as drug targets, has been designed. Besides predicting pathogen-specific proteins essentiality, chokepoint property, etc., three new algorithms were developed and implemented by using protein sequences, domains, structures, and metabolic reactions for construction of partial metabolic networks (PMNs), determination of conservation in critical residues, and variation analysis of residues forming similar cavities in proteins sequences. First, PMNs are constructed to determine the extent of disturbances in metabolite production by targeting a protein as drug target. Conservation of pathogen-specific protein's critical residues involved in cavity formation and biological function determined at domain-level with low-matching sequences. Last, variation analysis of residues forming similar cavities in proteins sequences from pathogenic versus non-pathogenic bacteria and humans is performed. Results The server is capable of predicting drug targets for any sequenced pathogenic bacteria having fasta sequences and annotated information. The utility of UniDrug-Target server was demonstrated for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv). The UniDrug-Target identified 265 mycobacteria pathogen-specific proteins, including 17 essential proteins which can be potential drug targets. Conclusions/Significance UniDrug-Target is expected to accelerate pathogen-specific drug targets identification which will increase their success and durability as drugs developed against them have less chance to develop resistances and adverse impact on environment. The server is freely available at http://117.211.115.67/UDT/main.html. The standalone application (source codes) is available at http://www.bioinformatics.org/ftp/pub/bioinfojuit/UDT.rar."
https://openalex.org/W2091712452,"Cultivation of wild-harvested plant species has been proposed as a way of reducing over-exploitation of wild populations but lack of technical knowledge is thought to be a barrier preventing people from cultivating a new species. Training programmes are therefore used to increase technical knowledge to encourage people to adopt cultivation. We assessed the impact of a training programme aiming to encourage cultivation of xaté (Chamaedorea ernesti-augusti), an over-harvested palm from Central America. Five years after the training programme ended, we surveyed untrained and trained individuals focusing on four potential predictors of behaviour: technical knowledge, attitudes (what individuals think about a behaviour), subjective norms (what individuals perceive others to think of a behaviour) and perceived behavioural control (self assessment of whether individuals can enact the behaviour successfully). Whilst accounting for socioeconomic variables, we investigate the influence of training upon these behavioural predictors and examine the factors that determine whether people adopt cultivation of a novel species. Those who had been trained had higher levels of technical knowledge about xaté cultivation and higher belief in their ability to cultivate it while training was not associated with differences in attitudes or subjective norms. Technical knowledge and perceived behavioural control (along with socio-economic variables such as forest ownership and age) were predictors of whether individuals cultivate xaté. We suggest that training programmes can have a long lasting effect on individuals and can change behaviour. However, in many situations other barriers to cultivation, such as access to seeds or appropriate markets, will need to be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W1992048688,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most frequent cause of illness and death from an infectious agent, and its interaction with HIV has devastating effects. We determined plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), its circulating form DHEA-suphate (DHEA-s) and cortisol in different stages of M. tuberculosis infection, and explored their role on the Th1 and Treg populations during different scenarios of HIV-TB coinfection, including the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), a condition related to antiretroviral treatment. DHEA levels were diminished in HIV-TB and HIV-TB IRIS patients compared to healthy donors (HD), HIV+ individuals and HIV+ individuals with latent TB (HIV-LTB), whereas dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-s) levels were markedly diminished in HIV-TB IRIS individuals. HIV-TB and IRIS patients presented a cortisol/DHEA ratio significantly higher than HIV+, HIV-LTB and HD individuals. A positive correlation was observed between DHEA-s and CD4 count among HIV-TB individuals. Conversely, cortisol plasma level inversely correlated with CD4 count within HIV-TB individuals. M. tuberculosis-specific Th1 lymphocyte count was increased after culturing PBMC from HIV-TB individuals in presence of DHEA. We observed an inverse correlation between DHEA-s plasma level and Treg frequency in co-infected individuals, and CD4+FoxP3+ Treg frequency was increased in HIV-TB and IRIS patients compared to other groups. Strikingly, we observed a prominent CD4+CD25-FoxP3+ population across HIV-TB and HIV-TB IRIS patients, which frequency correlated with DHEA plasma level. Finally, DHEA treatment negatively regulated FoxP3 expression without altering Treg frequency in co-infected patients. These data suggest an enhancing role for DHEA in the immune response against M. tuberculosis during HIV-TB coinfection and IRIS."
https://openalex.org/W2156907859,"Pyrococcus abyssi NucS is the founding member of a new family of structure-specific DNA endonucleases that interact with the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Using a combination of small angle x-ray scattering and surface plasmon resonance analyses, we demonstrate the formation of a stable complex in solution, in which one molecule of the PabNucS homodimer binds to the outside surface of the PabPCNA homotrimer. Using fluorescent labels, PCNA is shown to increase the binding affinity of NucS toward single-strand/double-strand junctions on 5' and 3' flaps, as well as to modulate the cleavage specificity on the branched DNA structures. Our results indicate that the presence of a single major contact between the PabNucS and PabPCNA proteins, together with the complex-induced DNA bending, facilitate conformational flexibility required for specific cleavage at the single-strand/double-strand DNA junction."
https://openalex.org/W2096183252,"In Indonesia, Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is the most frequent cancer of the head and neck region. At first presentation in the hospital most patients already have advanced NPC. Our previous study showed that general practitioners (GPs) working in Yogyakarta, Indonesia lack the knowledge necessary for early detection of NPC. By providing training on early symptoms of NPC we hope that the diagnosis and referral will occur at an earlier stage. Here we assess the current NPC knowledge levels of GPs in Jakarta, evaluate improvement after training, compare the effectiveness of two training formats, and estimate the loss of recall over a two week period. Methods Two Indonesian GPs visited 31 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCCs) and provided a lecture on NPC. The alternative format consisted of a symposium at the Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, presented by local head and neck surgeons, with all GPs in the region being invited. To evaluate the effect of both formats a questionnaire was conducted before and after. Results The lecture in the PHCCs was attended by 130 GPs. Sixty-six GPs attended the training in the university hospital and 40 GPs attended both. Pre training the NPC knowledge level was poor with an average of 1.6 symptoms being correctly identified out of a potential maximum of 12, this was increased to 4.9 post training (p<0.0001). GPs attending the PHCC course recorded a greater increase in correct symptoms than those attending the symposium (3.8 vs. 2.8; p = 0.01). After a two week period the knowledge levels had declined slightly from 5.5 correctly identified symptoms to 4.2 (p = 0.25). Conclusion These results confirm our findings regarding GPs insufficient knowledge of NPC. Lectures in the PHCC and a symposium have both been proven to be effective training tools in the education of GPs."
https://openalex.org/W2070123744,"Sex differences in many spatial and verbal tasks appear to reflect an inherent low-level processing bias for movement in males and objects in females. We explored this potential movement/object bias in men and women using a computer task that measured targeting performance and/or color recognition. The targeting task showed a ball moving vertically towards a horizontal line. Before reaching the line, the ball disappeared behind a masking screen, requiring the participant to imagine the movement vector and identify the intersection point. For the color recognition task, the ball briefly changed color before disappearing beneath the mask and participants were required only to identify the color shade. Results showed that targeting accuracy for slow and fast moving balls was significantly better in males compared to females. No sex difference was observed for color shade recognition. We also studied a third, dual attention task comprised of the first two, where the moving ball briefly changed color randomly just before passing beneath the masking screen. When the ball changed color, participants were required only to identify the color shade. If the ball didn't change color, participants estimated the intersection point. Participants in this dual attention condition were first tested with the targeting and color tasks alone and showed results that were similar to the previous groups tested on a single task. However, under the dual attention condition, male accuracy in targeting, as well as color shade recognition, declined significantly compared to their performance when the tasks were tested alone. No significant changes were found in female performance. Finally, reaction times for targeting and color choices in both sexes correlated highly with ball speed, but not accuracy. Overall, these results provide evidence of a sex-related bias in processing objects versus movement, which may reflect sex differences in bottom up versus top-down analytical strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2153570131,"Staphylococcus aureus initiates infections and produces virulence factors, including superantigens (SAgs), at mucosal surfaces. The SAg, Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 (TSST-1) induces cytokine secretion from epithelial cells, antigen presenting cells (APCs) and T lymphocytes, and causes toxic shock syndrome (TSS). This study investigated the mechanism of TSST-1-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from human vaginal epithelial cells (HVECs) and determined if curcumin, an anti-inflammatory agent, could reduce TSST-1-mediated pathology in a rabbit vaginal model of TSS. TSST-1 caused a significant increase in NF-κB-dependent transcription in HVECs that was associated with increased expression of TNF- α, MIP-3α, IL-6 and IL-8. Curcumin, an antagonist of NF-κB-dependent transcription, inhibited IL-8 production from ex vivo porcine vaginal explants at nontoxic doses. In a rabbit model of TSS, co-administration of curcumin with TSST-1 intravaginally reduced lethality by 60% relative to 100% lethality in rabbits receiving TSST-1 alone. In addition, TNF-α was undetectable from serum or vaginal tissue of curcumin treated rabbits that survived. These data suggest that the inflammatory response induced at the mucosal surface by TSST-1 is NF-κB dependent. In addition, the ability of curcumin to prevent TSS in vivo by co-administration with TSST-1 intravaginally suggests that the vaginal mucosal proinflammatory response to TSST-1 is important in the progression of mTSS."
https://openalex.org/W2074735551,"Scanning electron microscopes (SEM), which image sample surfaces by scanning with an electron beam, are widely used for steric observations of resting samples in basic and applied biology. Various conventional methods exist for SEM sample preparation. However, conventional SEM is not a good tool to observe living organisms because of the associated exposure to high vacuum pressure and electron beam radiation. Here we attempted SEM observations of live ticks. During 1.5×10(-3) Pa vacuum pressure and electron beam irradiation with accelerated voltages (2-5 kV), many ticks remained alive and moved their legs. After 30-min observation, we removed the ticks from the SEM stage; they could walk actively under atmospheric pressure. When we tested 20 ticks (8 female adults and 12 nymphs), they survived for two days after SEM observation. These results indicate the resistance of ticks against SEM observation. Our second survival test showed that the electron beam, not vacuum conditions, results in tick death. Moreover, we describe the reaction of their legs to electron beam exposure. These findings open the new possibility of SEM observation of living organisms and showed the resistance of living ticks to vacuum condition in SEM. These data also indicate, for the first time, the usefulness of tick as a model system for biology under extreme condition."
https://openalex.org/W2054953428,"Sexual coevolution occurs when changes in the phenotype of one sex select for changes in the other sex. We can identify the ""footprint"" of this coevolution by mating males and females from different populations and testing for a male-female genotype interaction for a trait associated with male (or female) performance. Here we mated male Drosophila melanogaster from five different continents with females from their own and different continents to test for a male-female interaction for mating speed, a pre-copulatory trait, and female reproductive investment, a post-copulatory trait. We found a strong male-female interaction for mating speed, consistent with previous studies using different populations, suggesting that the potential for sexual coevolution for this trait is present in this species. In contrast, we did not detect a male-female interaction for female reproductive investment. Although a male-female interaction for mating speed is compatible with the hypothesis of ongoing sexual coevolution, the nature of our experimental design is unable to exclude alternate explanations. Thus, the evolutionary mechanisms promoting male-female genotype interactions for pre-copulatory mating traits in D. melanogaster warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2026139285,"Deregulation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway could compromise genomic integrity in normal cells and reduce cancer cell sensitivity to anticancer treatments. We found that intercellular contact stabilizes histone H2AX and γH2AX (H2AX phosphorylated on Ser-139) by up-regulating N/E-cadherin and γ-catenin. γ-catenin and its DNA-binding partner LEF-1 indirectly increase levels of H2AX by suppressing the promoter of the RNF8 ubiquitin ligase, which decreases levels of H2AX protein under conditions of low intercellular contact. Hyperphosphorylation of DDR proteins is induced by up-regulated H2AX. Constitutive apoptosis is caused in confluent cells but is not further induced by DNA damage. This is conceivably due to insufficient p53 activation because ChIP assay shows that its DNA binding ability is not induced in those cells.

IntroductionAccumulation of mutations in the genome causes cancer development and progression. Genetic mutations can result in the activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressors and also change the levels or functions of “modifier” proteins that determine chemosensitivity or tumor progression, thus potentially increasing an organism's susceptibility to cancer and a myriad of other diseases (1.Hoeijmakers J.H.

Therefore, appropriate activation of the DDR machinery after DNA damage is crucial in cellular defenses against malignant transformation. In addition, anticancer treatments, such as ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic reagents (e.g. neocarzinostatin (NCS) and doxorubicin), induce DSBs and consequently activate DDR-induced cell death. Thus, in addition to guarding against DNA damage-induced malignant progression, the DDR machinery also determines cancer cells' sensitivity to anticancer therapy.One of the most important proteins in the DDR pathway is histone H2AX (6.Fernandez-Capetillo O.

The roles of cadherins and catenins in regulating cell adhesion and Wnt signaling have been thoroughly characterized (29.Kemler R. From cadherins to catenins.

However, the functions of these families of proteins in regulating cell stress pathways are largely unknown.In this study, we describe a novel mechanism of regulating H2AX protein levels through a pathway involving RNF8, N/E-cadherin, γ-catenin, and LEF-1. We found that increased intercellular contact reduces proteasomal degradation of histone H2AX and its phosphorylated form (γH2AX). We also show that the RNF8 ubiquitin ligase down-regulates H2AX under conditions of low intercellular contact. Furthermore, we show that intercellular contact stabilizes H2AX by suppressing RNF8 expression through the N/E-cadherin·γ-catenin·LEF-1 pathway. We provide evidence that through stabilized H2AX, intercellular contact creates a state of DDR hyperphosphorylation, increases basal cell death, and increases cellular resistance to DSB-induced cell death. We demonstrate that the reduction in DSB-induced cell death occurs not through a reduction in DSBs but through a reduction in p53-mediated gene expression when confluent cell culture is exposed to DNA damage stimuli. Our results suggest that intercellular contact might induce malignant transformation or resistance to anticancer treatments by promoting H2AX-mediated deregulation of the DDR pathway and the accumulation of cells with abrogation in p53-mediated apoptosis.DISCUSSIONThe DDR pathway plays crucial roles in cellular defense against DSB-induced malignant transformation as well as the induction of cell death by anticancer treatments. The importance of histone H2AX and its phosphorylated form γH2AX in the DDR has been extensively studied. γH2AX proteins not only serve as markers of DSBs (30.McCrea P.D. Turck C.W. Gumbiner B.

Although the regulation and significance of H2AX and γH2AX under conditions of DNA damage have been investigated, the roles of the protein under physiological conditions remain to be elucidated.Our results point to a novel mechanism of H2AX regulation by which N/E-cadherin and γ-catenin, which have been implicated in intercellular contact, determine levels of H2AX. Previous studies have demonstrated that γ-catenin and its homolog, β-catenin, share dimerization partners and functions (25.Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R.

In particular, the ability of γ- and β-catenin to form a complex with the LEF-1/TCF family of transcription factors (33.Shanbhag N.M. Rafalska-Metcalf I.U. Balane-Bolivar C. Janicki S.M.

Elledge S.J. The DNA damage response. Putting checkpoints in perspective.Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar) suggests that the increased γ-catenin in confluent cell cultures can directly or indirectly control levels of H2AX. Several studies have suggested that transactivation of the promoter by γ-catenin is indirectly caused by an increase in the levels of endogenous β-catenin (34.Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. The DNA damage response. Putting checkpoints in perspective.Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar, 39.Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. DNA damage activates ATM through intermolecular autophosphorylation and dimer dissociation.Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2653) Google Scholar). However, a recent study proposed an alternative mechanism and showed that overexpression of γ-catenin induces transactivation in a β-catenin-null cell line (32.Maeda O. Usami N. Kondo M. Takahashi M. Goto H. Shimokata K. Kusugami K. Sekido Y. Plakoglobin (γ-catenin) has TCF/LEF family-dependent transcriptional activity in β-catenin-deficient cell line.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In our study, when cells became confluent, γ-catenin was up-regulated, whereas β-catenin was not (Fig. 3A). Thus, we posit that γ-catenin is directly involved in regulating levels of H2AX in confluent cell cultures, rather than activation of β-catenin. These results suggest that induction or repression of proteins under conditions of intercellular contact is also mediated by active γ-catenin·LEF-1 complex.RNF8 has been shown to ubiquitinate γH2AX during the DDR (20.Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J. RNF8 transduces the DNA-damage signal via histone ubiquitylation and checkpoint protein assembly.Cell. 2007; 131: 901-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 22.Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Faustrup H. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. RNF8 ubiquitylates histones at DNA double-strand breaks and promotes assembly of repair proteins.Cell. 2007; 131: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar); however, the modification and its physiological roles remain to be detailed. We found that RNF8 induces diubiquitination of H2AX in sparse but not confluent cells (not shown), although the importance of this diubiquitination in regulating H2AX stability in sparse cell cultures remains to be investigated. Recently, RNF8 was shown to be involved in transcriptional repression (15.Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. Differential nuclear translocation and transactivation potential of beta-catenin and plakoglobin.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Consistently, our results indicate that RNF8 can suppress the H2AX promoter in the absence of DNA damage. We also found that the human RNF8 promoter that we used for the luciferase assay contains at least 15 binding sites for LEF-1 (supplemental Fig. 3), as predicted by the TRANSFAC program, and that both γ-catenin and LEF-1 suppressed the activity of the RNF8 promoter. Together, the results from our promoter studies suggest that intercellular contact and γ-catenin up-regulate H2AX by reducing RNF8 expression.We show that DDR-associated proteins, such as H2AX, ATM, and DNA-PK, are highly phosphorylated by intercellular contact without DNA damage. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed no appreciable dot pattern of γH2AX in confluent cells without DNA damage (Fig. 6A), suggesting that although intercellular contact induces hyperphosphorylation of DDR proteins (Fig. 4, A–C), it does not generate DSBs. Bakkenist and Kastan (39.Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. DNA damage activates ATM through intermolecular autophosphorylation and dimer dissociation.Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2653) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that chromatin-modifying conditions rapidly induce phosphorylated ATM that forms diffused nuclear localization patterns rather than dot patterns. Taken together with our results of diffused γH2AX localization in undamaged confluent cells (Fig. 6A), we postulate that intercellular contact may alter chromatin structure, leading to the induction of ATM phosphorylation at Ser-1981, DNA-PK at Ser-2056, and subsequently H2AX at Ser-139. Interestingly, when confluent cells were DNA-damaged, γH2AX started to form dot patterns, indicating that the mechanism to localize H2AX to the sites of DNA lesions was intact and competent in confluent cell cultures.We show that, although DNA damage increases the phosphorylation of DDR proteins in confluent cultures, it does not induce apoptosis. We found that although p53 is highly phosphorylated on Ser-15 in confluent cells in response to DNA damage, its DNA binding ability is reduced, suggesting that the resistance of confluent cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis is at least in part due to insufficient activation of p53-dependent apoptosis. Consistently, expression of p21, a major target of p53 that is widely used as a reporter of p53 transactivational activity, is not induced by NCS or doxorubicin in confluent cells (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, basal levels of p21 in confluent cells are much higher than in sparse cells (Fig. 6B, time 0). Because the DNA binding ability of p53 is not increased in undamaged confluent cells, we postulate that the increase in basal p21 levels occurs through p53-independent pathways. The mechanism of how intercellular contact suppresses p53 accessibility to its target sequences remains unclear. However, it is possible that increased intercellular contact generates a population of cells in which p53-dependent apoptosis is compromised.These findings point to a novel mechanism of H2AX regulation by intercellular contact. The phosphorylated form of H2AX, γH2AX, has been shown to play a crucial role in recruiting DDR proteins to the sites of DNA lesions when cells are exposed to DNA stress (7.Fernandez-Capetillo O.

The results described here show that intercellular contact activates the cadherin-catenin pathway, leading to a decrease in the levels of RNF8 and a subsequent increase in the levels of H2AX and γH2AX in the absence of DNA damage. Increased levels of H2AX and γH2AX in turn create a state of constitutive DDR hyperphosphorylation and apoptosis through an unknown mechanism. Our data support the notion that the cell microenvironment may determine cellular commitment to apoptosis when cells are exposed to chemotherapeutic agents. IntroductionAccumulation of mutations in the genome causes cancer development and progression. Genetic mutations can result in the activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressors and also change the levels or functions of “modifier” proteins that determine chemosensitivity or tumor progression, thus potentially increasing an organism's susceptibility to cancer and a myriad of other diseases (1.Hoeijmakers J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2091266182,"It is widely accepted that gene expression regulation is a stochastic event. The common approach for its computer simulation requires detailed information on the interactions of individual molecules, which is often not available for the analyses of biological experiments. As an alternative approach, we employed a more intuitive model to simulate the experimental result, the Markov-chain model, in which a gene is regulated by activators and repressors, which bind the same site in a mutually exclusive manner. Our stochastic simulation in the presence of both activators and repressors predicted a Hill-coefficient of the dose-response curve closer to the experimentally observed value than the calculated value based on the simple additive effects of activators alone and repressors alone. The simulation also reproduced the heterogeneity of gene expression levels among individual cells observed by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting analysis. Therefore, our approach may help to apply stochastic simulations to broader experimental data."
