https://openalex.org/W2987068209,"Flying insects capable of navigating in highly cluttered natural environments can withstand in-flight collisions because of the combination of their low inertia1 and the resilience of their wings2, exoskeletons1 and muscles. Current insect-scale (less than ten centimetres long and weighing less than five grams) aerial robots3-6 use rigid microscale actuators, which are typically fragile under external impact. Biomimetic artificial muscles7-10 that are capable of large deformation offer a promising alternative for actuation because they can endure the stresses caused by such impacts. However, existing soft actuators11-13 have not yet demonstrated sufficient power density to achieve lift-off, and their actuation nonlinearity and limited bandwidth create further challenges for achieving closed-loop (driven by an input control signal that is adjusted based on sensory feedback) flight control. Here we develop heavier-than-air aerial robots powered by soft artificial muscles that demonstrate open-loop (driven by a predetermined signal without feedback), passively stable (upright during flight) ascending flight as well as closed-loop, hovering flight. The robots are driven by multi-layered dielectric elastomer actuators that weigh 100 milligrams each and have a resonance frequency of 500 hertz and power density of 600 watts per kilogram. To increase the mechanical power output of the actuator and to demonstrate flight control, we present ways to overcome challenges unique to soft actuators, such as nonlinear transduction and dynamic buckling. These robots can sense and withstand collisions with surrounding obstacles and can recover from in-flight collisions by exploiting material robustness and vehicle passive stability. We also fly two micro-aerial vehicles simultaneously in a cluttered environment. They collide with the wall and each other without suffering damage. These robots rely on offboard amplifiers and an external motion-capture system to provide power to the dielectric elastomer actuators and to control their flight. Our work demonstrates how soft actuators can achieve sufficient power density and bandwidth to enable controlled flight, illustrating the potential of developing next-generation agile soft robots."

Biomarkers may facilitate identification of these responding tumors3. Neoadjuvant use of these agents is associated with pathological complete response in a spectrum of tumors, including urothelial cancer4-7. Sequential tissue sampling from these studies allowed for detailed on-treatment biomarker analysis. Here, we present a single-arm phase 2 study, investigating two cycles of atezolizumab before cystectomy in 95 patients with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02662309). Pathological complete response was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints focused on safety, relapse-free survival and biomarker analysis. The pathological complete response rate was 31% (95% confidence interval: 21-41%), achieving the primary efficacy endpoint. Baseline biomarkers showed that the presence of preexisting activated T cells was more prominent than expected and correlated with outcome. Other established biomarkers, such as tumor mutational burden, did not predict outcome, differentiating this from the metastatic setting. Dynamic changes to gene expression signatures and protein biomarkers occurred with therapy, whereas changes in DNA alterations with treatment were uncommon. Responding tumors showed predominant expression of genes related to tissue repair after treatment, making tumor biomarker interpretation challenging in this group. Stromal factors such as transforming growth factor-β and fibroblast activation protein were linked to resistance, as was high expression of cell cycle gene signatures after treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2987834130,"The development of effective therapies against brain metastasis is currently hindered by limitations in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving it. Here we define the contributions of tumour-secreted exosomes to brain metastatic colonization and demonstrate that pre-conditioning the brain microenvironment with exosomes from brain metastatic cells enhances cancer cell outgrowth. Proteomic analysis identified cell migration-inducing and hyaluronan-binding protein (CEMIP) as elevated in exosomes from brain metastatic but not lung or bone metastatic cells. CEMIP depletion in tumour cells impaired brain metastasis, disrupting invasion and tumour cell association with the brain vasculature, phenotypes rescued by pre-conditioning the brain microenvironment with CEMIP+ exosomes. Moreover, uptake of CEMIP+ exosomes by brain endothelial and microglial cells induced endothelial cell branching and inflammation in the perivascular niche by upregulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines encoded by Ptgs2, Tnf and Ccl/Cxcl, known to promote brain vascular remodelling and metastasis. CEMIP was elevated in tumour tissues and exosomes from patients with brain metastasis and predicted brain metastasis progression and patient survival. Collectively, our findings suggest that targeting exosomal CEMIP could constitute a future avenue for the prevention and treatment of brain metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2987911680,"Chromosome folding is modulated as cells progress through the cell cycle. During mitosis, condensins fold chromosomes into helical loop arrays. In interphase, the cohesin complex generates loops and topologically associating domains (TADs), while a separate process of compartmentalization drives segregation of active and inactive chromatin. We used synchronized cell cultures to determine how the mitotic chromosome conformation transforms into the interphase state. Using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analysis, chromatin binding assays and immunofluorescence, we show that, by telophase, condensin-mediated loops are lost and a transient folding intermediate is formed that is devoid of most loops. By cytokinesis, cohesin-mediated CTCF-CTCF loops and the positions of TADs emerge. Compartment boundaries are also established early, but long-range compartmentalization is a slow process and proceeds for hours after cells enter G1. Our results reveal the kinetics and order of events by which the interphase chromosome state is formed and identify telophase as a critical transition between condensin- and cohesin-driven chromosome folding."
https://openalex.org/W2985294481,"The investigational drugs E7820, indisulam and tasisulam (aryl-sulfonamides) promote the degradation of the splicing factor RBM39 in a proteasome-dependent mechanism. While the activity critically depends on the cullin RING ligase substrate receptor DCAF15, the molecular details remain elusive. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the DDB1-DCAF15-DDA1 core ligase complex bound to RBM39 and E7820 at a resolution of 4.4 Å, together with crystal structures of engineered subcomplexes. We show that DCAF15 adopts a new fold stabilized by DDA1, and that extensive protein-protein contacts between the ligase and substrate mitigate low affinity interactions between aryl-sulfonamides and DCAF15. Our data demonstrate how aryl-sulfonamides neo-functionalize a shallow, non-conserved pocket on DCAF15 to selectively bind and degrade RBM39 and the closely related splicing factor RBM23 without the requirement for a high-affinity ligand, which has broad implications for the de novo discovery of molecular glue degraders."
https://openalex.org/W2986073722,"Following severe or chronic liver injury, adult ductal cells (cholangiocytes) contribute to regeneration by restoring both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. We recently showed that ductal cells clonally expand as self-renewing liver organoids that retain their differentiation capacity into both hepatocytes and ductal cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which adult ductal-committed cells acquire cellular plasticity, initiate organoids and regenerate the damaged tissue remain largely unknown. Here, we describe that ductal cells undergo a transient, genome-wide, remodelling of their transcriptome and epigenome during organoid initiation and in vivo following tissue damage. TET1-mediated hydroxymethylation licences differentiated ductal cells to initiate organoids and activate the regenerative programme through the transcriptional regulation of stem-cell genes and regenerative pathways including the YAP–Hippo signalling. Our results argue in favour of the remodelling of genomic methylome/hydroxymethylome landscapes as a general mechanism by which differentiated cells exit a committed state in response to tissue damage. Aloia, McKie, Vernaz et al. show that during liver damage ductal cells acquire cellular plasticity by undergoing epigenetic remodelling, with TET1-mediated regulation of ErbB–MAPK and YAP–Hippo signalling."

https://openalex.org/W2983199633,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) shows great cellular heterogeneity, with pronounced epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cell populations. However, the cellular hierarchy underlying PDAC cell diversity is unknown. Here we identify the tetraspanin CD9 as a marker of PDAC tumour-initiating cells. CD9high cells had increased organoid formation capability, and generated tumour grafts in vivo at limiting dilutions. Tumours initiated from CD9high cells recapitulated the cellular heterogeneity of primary PDAC, whereas CD9low cells produced only duct-like epithelial progeny. CD9 knockdown decreased the growth of PDAC organoids, and heterozygous CD9 deletion in Pdx1-Cre; LSL-KRasG12D; p53F/F mice prolonged overall survival. Mechanistically, CD9 promoted the plasma membrane localization of the glutamine transporter ASCT2, enhancing glutamine uptake in PDAC cells. Thus, our study identifies a PDAC subpopulation capable of initiating PDAC and giving rise to PDAC heterogeneity, suggesting that the cellular diversity of PDAC is generated by PDAC stem cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2986783546,"Efforts to construct synthetic biological circuits with more complex functions have often been hindered by the idiosyncratic behavior, limited dynamic range and crosstalk of commonly utilized parts. Here, we employ de novo RNA design to develop two high-performance translational repressors with sensing and logic capabilities. These synthetic riboregulators, termed toehold repressors and three-way junction (3WJ) repressors, detect transcripts with nearly arbitrary sequences, repress gene expression by up to 300-fold and yield orthogonal sets of up to 15 devices. Automated forward engineering is used to improve toehold repressor dynamic range and SHAPE-Seq is applied to confirm the designed switching mechanism of 3WJ repressors in living cells. We integrate the modular repressors into biological circuits that execute universal NAND and NOR logic and evaluate the four-input expression NOT ((A1 AND A2) OR (B1 AND B2)) in Escherichia coli. These capabilities make toehold and 3WJ repressors valuable new tools for biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2986117925,"With ageing, intrinsic haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity decreases, resulting in impaired tissue homeostasis, reduced engraftment following transplantation and increased susceptibility to diseases. However, whether ageing also affects the HSC niche, and thereby impairs its capacity to support HSC function, is still widely debated. Here, by using in-vivo long-term label-retention assays we demonstrate that aged label-retaining HSCs, which are, in old mice, the most quiescent HSC subpopulation with the highest regenerative capacity and cellular polarity, reside predominantly in perisinusoidal niches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sinusoidal niches are uniquely preserved in shape, morphology and number on ageing. Finally, we show that myeloablative chemotherapy can selectively disrupt aged sinusoidal niches in the long term, which is linked to the lack of recovery of endothelial Jag2 at sinusoids. Overall, our data characterize the functional alterations of the aged HSC niche and unveil that perisinusoidal niches are uniquely preserved and thereby protect HSCs from ageing."

https://openalex.org/W2988704237,"Tumours depend on altered rates of protein synthesis for growth and survival, which suggests that mechanisms controlling mRNA translation may be exploitable for therapy. Here, we show that loss of APC, which occurs almost universally in colorectal tumours, strongly enhances the dependence on the translation initiation factor eIF2B5. Depletion of eIF2B5 induces an integrated stress response and enhances translation of MYC via an internal ribosomal entry site. This perturbs cellular amino acid and nucleotide pools, strains energy resources and causes MYC-dependent apoptosis. eIF2B5 limits MYC expression and prevents apoptosis in APC-deficient murine and patient-derived organoids and in APC-deficient murine intestinal epithelia in vivo. Conversely, the high MYC levels present in APC-deficient cells induce phosphorylation of eIF2α via the kinases GCN2 and PKR. Pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 phenocopies eIF2B5 depletion and has therapeutic efficacy in tumour organoids, which demonstrates that a negative MYC-eIF2α feedback loop constitutes a targetable vulnerability of colorectal tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2986988144,"Personality traits can offer considerable insight into the biological basis of individual differences. However, existing approaches toward understanding personality across species rely on subjective criteria and limited sets of behavioral readouts, which result in noisy and often inconsistent outcomes. Here we introduce a mathematical framework for describing individual differences along dimensions with maximum consistency and discriminative power. We validate this framework in mice, using data from a system for high-throughput longitudinal monitoring of group-housed male mice that yields a variety of readouts from across the behavioral repertoire of individual animals. We demonstrate a set of stable traits that capture variability in behavior and gene expression in the brain, allowing for better-informed mechanistic investigations into the biology of individual differences."
https://openalex.org/W2983301825,"The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system is an efficient non-viral gene transfer tool in mammalian cells, but its broad use has been hampered by uncontrolled transposase gene activity from DNA vectors, posing a risk of genome instability, and by the inability to use the transposase protein directly. In this study, we used rational protein design based on the crystal structure of the hyperactive SB100X variant to create an SB transposase (high-solubility SB, hsSB) with enhanced solubility and stability. We demonstrate that hsSB can be delivered with transposon DNA to genetically modify cell lines and embryonic, hematopoietic and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), overcoming uncontrolled transposase activity. We used hsSB to generate chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which exhibit potent antitumor activity in vitro and in xenograft mice. We found that hsSB spontaneously penetrates cells, enabling modification of iPSCs and generation of CAR T cells without the use of transfection reagents. Titration of hsSB to modulate genomic integration frequency achieved as few as two integrations per genome."
https://openalex.org/W2985267612,"In the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cln3-cyclin-dependent kinase activity enables Start, the irreversible commitment to the cell division cycle. However, the concentration of Cln3 has been paradoxically considered to remain constant during G1, due to the presumed scaling of its production rate with cell size dynamics. Measuring metabolic and biosynthetic activity during cell cycle progression in single cells, we found that cells exhibit pulses in their protein production rate. Rather than scaling with cell size dynamics, these pulses follow the intrinsic metabolic dynamics, peaking around Start. Using a viral-based bicistronic construct and targeted proteomics to measure Cln3 at the single-cell and population levels, we show that the differential scaling between protein production and cell size leads to a temporal increase in Cln3 concentration, and passage through Start. This differential scaling causes Start in both daughter and mother cells across growth conditions. Thus, uncoupling between two fundamental physiological parameters drives cell cycle commitment."
https://openalex.org/W2987005178,"Abstract Periodontal diseases can lead to chronic inflammation affecting the integrity of the tooth supporting tissues. Recently, a striking association has been made between periodontal diseases and primary cancers in the absence of a mechanistic understanding. Here we address the effect of periodontal inflammation (PI) on tumor progression, metastasis, and possible underlining mechanisms. We show that an experimental model of PI in mice can promote lymph node (LN) micrometastasis, as well as head and neck metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer cells, both in early and late stages of cancer progression. The cervical LNs had a greater tumor burden and infiltration of MDSC and M2 macrophages compared with LNs at other sites. Pyroptosis and the resultant IL-1β production were detected in patients with PI, mirrored in mouse models. Anakinra, IL-1 receptor antagonist, limited metastasis, and MDSC recruitment at early stages of tumor progression, but failed to reverse established metastatic tumors. PI and the resulting production of IL-1β was found to promote CCL5, CXCL12, CCL2, and CXCL5 expression. These chemokines recruit MDSC and macrophages, finally enabling the generation of a premetastatic niche in the inflammatory site. These findings support the idea that periodontal inflammation promotes metastasis of breast cancer by recruiting MDSC in part by pyroptosis-induced IL-1β generation and downstream CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL5 signaling in the early steps of metastasis. These studies define the role for IL-1β in the metastatic progression of breast cancer and highlight the need to control PI, a pervasive inflammatory condition in older patients."
https://openalex.org/W2986417522,"Lysostaphin is a bacteriolytic enzyme targeting peptidoglycan, the essential component of the bacterial cell envelope. It displays a very potent and specific activity toward staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Lysostaphin causes rapid cell lysis and disrupts biofilms, and is therefore a therapeutic agent of choice to eradicate staphylococcal infections. The C-terminal SH3b domain of lysostaphin recognizes peptidoglycans containing a pentaglycine crossbridge and has been proposed to drive the preferential digestion of staphylococcal cell walls. Here we elucidate the molecular mechanism underpinning recognition of staphylococcal peptidoglycan by the lysostaphin SH3b domain. We show that the pentaglycine crossbridge and the peptide stem are recognized by two independent binding sites located on opposite sides of the SH3b domain, thereby inducing a clustering of SH3b domains. We propose that this unusual binding mechanism allows synergistic and structurally dynamic recognition of S. aureus peptidoglycan and underpins the potent bacteriolytic activity of this enzyme. A structural look at the interaction between the SH3b domain of the peptidoglycan endopeptidase lysostaphin and the target for its antistaphylococcal activity, peptidoglycan, reveals a mechanism of bacterial cell wall binding."
https://openalex.org/W2985683659,"Cell migration is hypothesized to involve a cycle of behaviours beginning with leading edge extension. However, recent evidence suggests that the leading edge may be dispensable for migration, raising the question of what actually controls cell directionality. Here, we exploit the embryonic migration of Drosophila macrophages to bridge the different temporal scales of the behaviours controlling motility. This approach reveals that edge fluctuations during random motility are not persistent and are weakly correlated with motion. In contrast, flow of the actin network behind the leading edge is highly persistent. Quantification of actin flow structure during migration reveals a stable organization and asymmetry in the cell-wide flowfield that strongly correlates with cell directionality. This organization is regulated by a gradient of actin network compression and destruction, which is controlled by myosin contraction and cofilin-mediated disassembly. It is this stable actin-flow polarity, which integrates rapid fluctuations of the leading edge, that controls inherent cellular persistence."

https://openalex.org/W2983600536,"The recombinant form of the peptide hormone relaxin, serelaxin (RLX), mediates its anti-fibrotic actions by impeding the profibrotic activity of cytokines including TGF-β1 and IL-1β. As IL-1β can be produced by the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, this study determined whether RLX targeted the inflammasome to inhibit the profibrotic TGF-β1/IL-1β axis in primary human cardiac myofibroblasts (HCMFs) in vitro and in mice with isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiomyopathy in vivo. HCMFs stimulated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), and ATP (5 mM) (T+L+A) for 8 h, to induce the NLRP3 inflammasome, demonstrated significantly increased protein expression of markers of NLRP3 priming (NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase-recruitment domain, procaspase-1) and activity (IL-1β, IL-18). After 72 h, there was significantly increased neuronal NOS (nNOS), TLR-4, procaspase-1, myofibroblast differentiation, and collagen-I deposition. These measures, along with interstitial TGF-β1 expression and collagen deposition, were also increased in the left ventricle (LV) of ISO-injured mice 14 d postinjury. RLX [16.8 nM (100 ng/ml) in vitro; 0.5 mg/kg per day in vivo] inhibited T+L+A- and ISO-induced TLR-4 expression, NLRP3 priming, IL-1β, IL-18, myofibroblast differentiation, and interstitial collagen deposition at the time points studied, via the promotion of nNOS; with the NLRP3- and IL-1β-inhibitory effects of RLX in HCMFs being abrogated by pharmacological blockade of nNOS or TLR-4. Comparatively, the small molecule NLRP3 inhibitor, N-{[(1,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydro-s-indacen-4-yl)amino]carbonyl}-4-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-2-furansulfonamide (1 μM in vitro, 10 mg/kg/d in vivo), inhibited components of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro and in vivo and ISO-induced interstitial LV fibrosis in vivo but did not affect nNOS, TLR-4, myofibroblast differentiation, or myofibroblast-induced collagen deposition. Hence, RLX can inhibit the TGF-β1/IL-1β axis via a nNOS-TLR-4-NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent mechanism on cardiac myofibroblasts.-Cáceres, F. T., Gaspari, T. A., Samuel, C. S., Pinar, A. A. Serelaxin inhibits the profibrotic TGF-β1/IL-1β axis by targeting TLR-4 and the NLRP3 inflammasome in cardiac myofibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2985857058,"It is well established that haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are generated from a transient subset of specialized endothelial cells termed haemogenic, present in the yolk sac, placenta and aorta, through an endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT). HSPC generation via EHT is thought to be restricted to the early stages of development. By using experimental embryology and genetic approaches in birds and mice, respectively, we document here the discovery of a bone marrow haemogenic endothelium in the late fetus/young adult. These cells are capable of de novo producing a cohort of HSPCs in situ that harbour a very specific molecular signature close to that of aortic endothelial cells undergoing EHT or their immediate progenies, i.e., recently emerged HSPCs. Taken together, our results reveal that HSPCs can be generated de novo past embryonic stages. Understanding the molecular events controlling this production will be critical for devising innovative therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2987605323,"Although chromosomal instability (CIN) is a common phenomenon in cleavage-stage embryogenesis following in vitro fertilization (IVF)1-3, its rate in naturally conceived human embryos is unknown. CIN leads to mosaic embryos that contain a combination of genetically normal and abnormal cells, and is significantly higher in in vitro-produced preimplantation embryos as compared to in vivo-conceived preimplantation embryos4. Even though embryos with CIN-derived complex aneuploidies may arrest between the cleavage and blastocyst stages of embryogenesis5,6, a high number of embryos containing abnormal cells can pass this strong selection barrier7,8. However, neither the prevalence nor extent of CIN during prenatal development and at birth, following IVF treatment, is well understood. Here we profiled the genomic landscape of fetal and placental tissues postpartum from both IVF and naturally conceived children, to investigate the prevalence and persistence of large genetic aberrations that probably arose from IVF-related CIN. We demonstrate that CIN is not preserved at later stages of prenatal development, and that de novo numerical aberrations or large structural DNA imbalances occur at similar rates in IVF and naturally conceived live-born neonates. Our findings affirm that human IVF treatment has no detrimental effect on the chromosomal constitution of fetal and placental lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2987970176,"Objective To assess the prevalence of child development delay and to identify socioeconomic determinants. Study design We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study of children 2 to 72 months of age residing in the state of Ceará, Brazil. In total, 3200 households were randomly selected for participation in the study and had child development assessed with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) version 3. Development delay was defined as a score of less than -2 standard deviations below the median of the Brazilian ASQ standard. We present population-level prevalence of delay in five development domains and assess socioeconomic determinants. Results A total of 3566 children completed the ASQ development assessment of which 9.2% (95% CI: 8.1–10.5) had at least one domain with development delay. The prevalence of delay increased with age in all domains and males were at higher risk for communication, gross motor and personal-social development delays as compared to females (p-values <0.05). We found robust associations of indicators of socioeconomic status with risk of development delay; increasing monthly income and higher social class were associated with reduced risk of delay across all domains (28,2% in the poorest and 21,2% in richest for any delay, p-values <0.05 for all domains). In addition, children in poor households that participated in conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs appeared to have reduced risk of delay as compared to children from households that were eligible, but did not participate, in CCT programs. Conclusions There is a relatively high population-level prevalence of development delay in at least one domain among children 0–6 years of age in Ceará, Brazil. Integrated child development, social support, and poverty reduction interventions may reduce the population-level prevalence of development delay in Ceará and similar settings."
https://openalex.org/W2983682252,"The relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and incident metabolic syndrome in metabolically healthy subjects is unknown. We aimed to investigate whether nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a predictor of future metabolic syndrome in metabolically healthy subjects.Subjects who underwent health evaluation at least twice between 2009 and 2015 from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort in South Korea were included. Patients without obesity who had no metabolic syndrome components were finally analyzed (n = 28,880). The definition of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was based on both the hepatic steatosis and fatty liver indices. The incidence of metabolic syndrome, prediabetes/type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was compared between the subjects with and without nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.The presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was associated with a higher risk of incident metabolic syndrome, prediabetes/type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in the entire cohort (metabolic syndrome: adjusted hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.71; prediabetes/type 2 diabetes: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.90; hypertension: adjusted hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-4.12; dyslipidemia: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.06). A similar finding was observed in the age-, sex-, smoking status-, and body mass index-based 1:5 propensity score-matched cohort of 1,092 subjects (metabolic syndrome: adjusted hazard ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.79-7.07; prediabetes/type 2 diabetes: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.73; hypertension: adjusted hazard ratio, 2.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-4.88; dyslipidemia: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.32).Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is an early predictor of metabolic dysfunction even in metabolically healthy populations."
https://openalex.org/W2986810323,"Mosaicism, the presence of subpopulations of cells bearing somatic mutations, is associated with disease and aging and has been detected in diverse tissues, including apparently normal cells adjacent to tumors. To analyze mosaicism on a large scale, we surveyed haplotype-specific somatic copy number alterations (sCNAs) in 1,708 normal-appearing adjacent-to-tumor (NAT) tissue samples from 27 cancer sites and in 7,149 blood samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We find substantial variation across tissues in the rate, burden and types of sCNAs, including those spanning entire chromosome arms. We document matching sCNAs in the NAT tissue and the adjacent tumor, suggesting a shared clonal origin, as well as instances in which both NAT tissue and tumor tissue harbor a gain of the same oncogene arising in parallel from distinct parental haplotypes. These results shed light on pan-tissue mutations characteristic of field cancerization, the presence of oncogenic processes adjacent to cancer cells. A survey of copy number alterations in normal-appearing tissue in cancer samples reveals pan-tissue patterns of mosaicism."
https://openalex.org/W2983434732,"Suicide which is considered a psychiatric emergency, is a serious cause of mortality worldwide. Youth living with HIV/AIDS (YLWHA) have higher rates of suicidal behavior than the general public. This study aimed to assess the magnitude and associated factors of suicide ideation and attempt among the Human Immune deficiency Virus (HIV) positive youth attending anti-retroviral therapy (ART) follow up at St. Paul`s hospital Millennium Medical College and St. Peter`s specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.In this cross-sectional study, 413 HIV positive youth were recruited for interviews, using the systematic random sampling technique. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess suicide. PHQ-9, the Oslo social support and HIV perceived stigma scale instruments were used to assess the factors. We computed bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regressions to assess factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempt. Statistical significance was declared at P-value <0.05.The magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempts were found to be 27.1% and 16.9%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, female sex (adjusted odd ratio(AOR) = 3.1, 95% CI, 1.6-6.0), family death (AOR = 2.1, 95%CI 1.15-3.85), WHO clinical stage III of HIV (AOR = 3.1 95% CI 1.3-7.35), WHO clinical stage IV of HIV (AOR = 4.76, 95%CI, 1.3-7.35), co-morbid depression (AOR = 7.14, 95%CI, 3.9-12.9), and perceived HIV stigma (AOR = 4.2, 95%CI, 2.27-8.2) were significantly associated with suicidal ideation, whereas female sex (AOR = 4.12, 95%CI, 1.82-9.78), opportunistic infections (AOR = 3.1, 95%CI, 1.6-6.04), WHO clinical stage III of HIV (AOR = 3.1 95%CI 1.24-7.81), co-morbid depression (AOR = 5.6 95% CI, 2.8-11.1), and poor social support (AOR = 3.4, 95%CI, 1.2-9.4) were statistically significant with suicidal attempt. The result suggests that the magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempts among HIV positive youth were high. We recommend that clinicians consider youth with comorbid depression, perceived HIV stigma and poor social support."
https://openalex.org/W2988207769,"Abstract The DEPTOR-mTORC1/2 axis has been shown to play an important, but a context dependent role in the regulation of proliferation and the survival of various cancer cells in cell culture settings. The in vivo role of DEPTOR in tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here we showed that the levels of both DEPTOR protein and mRNA were substantially decreased in human prostate cancer tissues, which positively correlated with disease progression. DEPTOR depletion accelerated proliferation and survival, migration, and invasion in human prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, DEPTOR depletion not only activated both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signals to promote cell proliferation and survival, but also induced an AKT-dependent epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and β-catenin nuclear translocation to promote cell migration and invasion. Abrogation of mTOR or AKT activation rescued the biological consequences of DEPTOR depletion. Importantly, in a Deptor -KO mouse model, Deptor knockout accelerated prostate tumorigenesis triggered by Pten loss via the activation of mTOR signaling. Collectively, our study demonstrates that DEPTOR is a tumor suppressor in the prostate, and its depletion promotes tumorigenesis via the activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signals. Thus, DEPTOR reactivation via a variety of means would have therapeutic potential for the treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2987048559,"Nuclear modifier genes have been proposed to modify the phenotypic expression of mitochondrial DNA mutations. Using a targeted exome-sequencing approach, here we found that the p.191Gly>Val mutation in mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (YARS2) interacts with the tRNASer(UCN) 7511A>G mutation in causing deafness. Strikingly, members of a Chinese family bearing both the YARS2 p.191Gly>Val and m.7511A>G mutations displayed much higher penetrance of deafness than those pedigrees carrying only the m.7511A>G mutation. The m.7511A>G mutation changed the A4:U69 base-pairing to G4:U69 pairing at the aminoacyl acceptor stem of tRNASer(UCN) and perturbed tRNASer(UCN) structure and function, including an increased melting temperature, altered conformation, instability, and aberrant aminoacylation of mutant tRNA. Using lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from symptomatic and asymptomatic members of these Chinese families and control subjects, we show that cell lines harboring only the m.7511A>G or p.191Gly>Val mutation revealed relatively mild defects in tRNASer(UCN) or tRNATyr metabolism, respectively. However, cell lines harboring both m.7511A>G and p.191Gly>Val mutations displayed more severe defective aminoacylations and lower tRNASer(UCN) and tRNATyr levels, aberrant aminoacylation, and lower levels of other tRNAs, including tRNAThr, tRNALys, tRNALeu(UUR), and tRNASer(AGY), than those in the cell lines carrying only the m.7511A>G or p.191Gly>Val mutation. Furthermore, mutant cell lines harboring both m.7511A>G and p.191Gly>Val mutations exhibited greater decreases in the levels of mitochondrial translation, respiration, and mitochondrial ATP and membrane potentials, along with increased production of reactive oxygen species. Our findings provide molecular-level insights into the pathophysiology of maternally transmitted deafness arising from the synergy between tRNASer(UCN) and mitochondrial YARS mutations. Nuclear modifier genes have been proposed to modify the phenotypic expression of mitochondrial DNA mutations. Using a targeted exome-sequencing approach, here we found that the p.191Gly>Val mutation in mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (YARS2) interacts with the tRNASer(UCN) 7511A>G mutation in causing deafness. Strikingly, members of a Chinese family bearing both the YARS2 p.191Gly>Val and m.7511A>G mutations displayed much higher penetrance of deafness than those pedigrees carrying only the m.7511A>G mutation.

These findings suggest that the nuclear modifier genes, especially those involved in mitochondrial tRNA metabolism, contributed to the phenotypic expression of m.7511A>G mutation. By target exome sequencing (genes encoding 20 mitochondrial tRNA synthetases and 25 tRNA modifying enzymes), we identified the known variant (c.572G>T, p.191Gly>Val) in the YARS2 gene encoding the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (31Bonnefond L.

In the present study, we further investigated the impact of the m.7511A>G mutation on the structure and function of tRNASer(UCN). The effects of YARS2 p.191Gly>Val and m.7511A>G mutations on mitochondrial functions were first assessed for the tRNA metabolism, including aminoacylation capacities and stability of tRNA, through the use of lymphoblastoid mutant cell lines derived from members of the Chinese family (individuals carrying only the m.7511A>G mutation, only the YARS2 p.191Gly>Val mutation or both m.7511A>G and heterozygous or homozygous p.191Gly>Val mutations), and genetically unrelated control subjects lacking these mutations. These cell lines were further evaluated for an effect on mitochondrial translation, respiration, production of ATP, mitochondrial membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). As shown in Fig. 1A, the m.7511A>G mutation changed the typical A4-U69 base-pairing into a noncanonical G4-U69 base-pairing at the acceptor stems. To experimentally test the effect of m.7511A>G mutation on the stability of tRNASer(UCN), we examined the melting temperatures (Tm) of WT (A4) and mutant (G4) tRNASer(UCN) transcripts. These Tm values were determined by calculating the derivatives of the absorbance against a temperature curve. As shown in Fig. 1B, the Tm values for WT (A4) and mutant (G4) tRNASer(UCN) transcripts were 41.7 and 51 °C, respectively. These data suggested that the tRNASer(UCN) with a G4:U69 bp may be more stable than the tRNASer(UCN) with an A4:U69 bp. As shown in Fig. 1C, electrophoretic patterns showed that the mutant (G4) tRNASer(UCN) transcript migrated faster than the WT (A4) tRNASer(UCN) transcript under native conditions. However, there was no difference of migration pattern between WT (A4) and mutant (G4) tRNASer(UCN) transcripts under denaturing conditions. These data indicated that the m.7511A>G mutation resulted in the conformational change of tRNASer(UCN). One Han Chinese hearing-impaired proband carrying the m.7511A>G mutation was identified among 2651 Chinese hearing-impaired probands but absent in 574 Chinese hearing-normal controls (28Tang X.

Mitochondrial tRNASer(UCN) variants in 2651 Han Chinese subjects with hearing loss.Mitochondrion. 2015; 23 (25968158): 17-2410.1016/j.mito.2015.05.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. S1A, the Chinese family exhibited extremely high penetrance of hearing loss. As shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1, 9 of 10 matrilineal relatives exhibited the variable degree of hearing impairment (two with mild hearing loss, six with moderate hearing loss, and one with severe hearing loss), whereas none of other members in this family had hearing loss. The age-at-onset of hearing loss ranged from 5 to 55 years old, with an average of 25 years old. There was no evidence that any of the other members of this family had any other causes to account for hearing loss. These matrilineal relatives showed no other clinical abnormalities, including cardiac failure, muscular diseases, visual failure, and neurological disorders. Further analysis showed that the m.7511A>G mutation was present in homoplasmy in all matrilineal relatives but not in other members of this family (Fig. S1B). The higher penetrance of hearing loss in this Chinese family implied that nuclear modifier genes, especially for genes involved in mitochondrial tRNA metabolism, influence the phenotypic manifestation of m.7511A>G mutation. To test this hypothesis, we performed targeting exome-sequencing analyses of 45 genes encoding 20 mitochondrial tRNA synthetases and 25 tRNA-modifying enzymes (Table S2) among seven matrilineal relatives (II-5, II-7, III-3, III-4, III-5, III-6, and III-7) and two married-in controls (II-4 and II-5) of WZD200 pedigree carrying the m.7511A>G mutation. As a result, we identified the known (c.572G>T, p.191Gly>Val) mutation in the YARS2 gene encoding the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase in six hearing-impaired matrilineal relatives but not in the hearing-normal matrilineal relative (III-7). We further analyzed the presence of the c.572G>T mutation in three symptomatic members and six asymptomatic subjects of this Chinese family and 13 symptomatic members and five asymptomatic subjects of a Japanese family (30Li R. Ishikawa K. Deng J.H. Heman-Ackah S. Tamagawa Y. Yang L. Bai Y. Ichimura K. Guan M.X. Maternally inherited nonsyndromic hearing loss is associated with the T7511C mutation in the mitochondrial tRNASer(UCN) gene in a Japanese family.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328 (15670746): 32-3710.1016/j.bbrc.2004.12.140Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, because the c.572G>T mutation disrupted a Tsp45I site (32Jiang P. Jin X. Peng Y. Wang M. Liu H. Liu X. Zhang Z. Ji Y. Zhang J. Liang M. Zhao F. Sun Y.H. Zhang M. Zhou X. Chen Y. et al.The exome sequencing identified the mutation in YARS2 encoding the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase as a nuclear modifier for the phenotypic manifestation of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy-associated mitochondrial DNA mutation.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25 (26647310): 584-59610.1093/hmg/ddv498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the Chinese family, the symptomatic subjects (II-1 and II-5) and married-in control (I-1) carried the homozygous c.572G>T mutation, the symptomatic subjects (I-2, II-2, II-7, III-3, III-4, III-5 and III-6) harbored the heterozygous c.572G>T mutation, and the asymptomatic individual (III-7) and three married controls lacked the c.572G>T mutation (Fig. S1A and Table S1). However, this mutation was absent in the members of the Japanese family (30Li R. Ishikawa K. Deng J.H. Heman-Ackah S. Tamagawa Y. Yang L. Bai Y. Ichimura K. Guan M.X. Maternally inherited nonsyndromic hearing loss is associated with the T7511C mutation in the mitochondrial tRNASer(UCN) gene in a Japanese family.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These suggested that the c.572G>T mutation may increase the penetrance of hearing loss in the Chinese family. To test if the m.7511A>G mutation affected the conformation of tRNASer(UCN) ex vivo, total RNAs from mitochondria isolated from various cell lines were electrophoresed through 15% polyacrylamide gel (native condition) and then electroblotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science) for hybridization analysis with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide probes for tRNASer(UCN) and tRNALeu(CUN), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1D, the electrophoretic patterns showed that the tRNASer(UCN) in the mutant cell lines (III-7) carrying the m.7511A>G mutation migrated faster than those of one cell line (A61) lacking this mutation. However, there were no differences in the migration of tRNALeu(CUN) between WT and mutant cell lines. To further examine the effect of m.7511A>G and c.572G>T mutations on the stability of tRNA, mitochondrial RNAs from various cell lines were subjected to Northern blotting and hybridized with DIG-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide probes specific for tRNASer(UCN), tRNATyr, tRNAGlu, tRNAAsp, tRNAMet, tRNALys, tRNALeu(UUR), and 5S rRNA, respectively. For comparison, the average levels of each tRNA in various cell lines were normalized according to the level of the 5S rRNA. As shown in Fig. 2, the steady-state levels of tRNASer(UCN) in the cell line III-7, bearing only the m.7511A>G mutation, and tRNATyr in the cell line I-1, carrying the homozygous c.572G>T mutation, were decreased 49.5 and 33.7%, respectively, as compared with those in the control cell line (A61) lacking these mutations. Strikingly, cells harboring both m.7511A>G and c.572G>T mutations exhibited drastic decreases in levels of tRNASer(UCN) and tRNATyr as well as various reductions in the other tRNAs (Fig. 2B). In particular, the average steady-state levels of tRNASer(UCN), tRNATyr, tRNAGlu, tRNAAsp, tRNAMet, tRNALys, and tRNALeu(UUR) in mutant cell lines carrying both m.7511A>G and homozygous c.572G>T mutations were decreased by 72.2, 58.9, 33.5, 69.6, 86.1, 13.5, and 21.2%, as compared with the average values in the control cell line (A61), respectively. Furthermore, the average steady-state levels of tRNASer(UCN), tRNATyr, tRNAGlu, tRNAAsp, tRNAMet, tRNALys, and tRNALeu(UUR) in mutant cell lines carrying both m.7511A>G and heterozygous c.572G>T mutations were"

Then, the cloud model theory is introduced to improve the importance scale and membership degree involved in the evaluation process, and the multi-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method of landslide risk improved by a cloud model is proposed. Thus, a multi-level fuzzy evaluation cloud model for evaluating landslide risk is established. Finally, using the improved cloud model method, a multistage fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of landslide risk is conducted for the K112+210~K112 +630 section of the Long Chuan to Huaiji Highway Project in Guangdong Province. The results show that the improved cloud model can solve the problem of uncertainty in the process of landslide preparation and occurrence, greatly improve the effectiveness of landslide evaluation results, and provide an effective reference for landslide disaster prevention."

https://openalex.org/W2985675597,"In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER oxidoreductin 1 (ERO1) catalyzes intramolecular disulfide-bond formation within its substrates in coordination with protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and related enzymes. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the ERO1–PDI system in plants are unknown. Reduction of the regulatory disulfide bonds of the ERO1 from soybean, GmERO1a, is catalyzed by enzymes in five classes of PDI family proteins. Here, using recombinant proteins, vacuum-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectroscopy, biochemical and protein refolding assays, and quantitative immunoblotting, we found that GmERO1a activity is regulated by reduction of intramolecular disulfide bonds involving Cys-121 and Cys-146, which are located in a disordered region, similarly to their locations in human ERO1. Moreover, a GmERO1a variant in which Cys-121 and Cys-146 were replaced with Ala residues exhibited hyperactive oxidation. Soybean PDI family proteins differed in their ability to regulate GmERO1a. Unlike yeast and human ERO1s, for which PDI is the preferred substrate, GmERO1a directly transferred disulfide bonds to the specific active center of members of five classes of PDI family proteins. Of these proteins, GmPDIS-1, GmPDIS-2, GmPDIM, and GmPDIL7 (which are group II PDI family proteins) failed to catalyze effective oxidative folding of substrate RNase A when there was an unregulated supply of disulfide bonds from the C121A/C146A hyperactive mutant GmERO1a, because of its low disulfide-bond isomerization activity. We conclude that regulation of plant ERO1 activity is particularly important for effective oxidative protein folding by group II PDI family proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2983445682,"The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial morphological event that occurs during epithelial tumor progression. ZEB1/2 are EMT transcription factors that are positively correlated with EMT phenotypes and breast cancer aggressiveness. ZEB1/2 regulate the alternative splicing and hence isoform switching of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) by repressing the epithelial splicing regulatory proteins, ESRP1 and ESRP2. Here, we show that the mesenchymal-like phenotypes of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells are dependent on autocrine FGF–FGFR signaling. Mesenchymal-like OSCC cells express low levels of ESRP1/2 and high levels of ZEB1/2, resulting in constitutive expression of the IIIc-isoform of FGFR, FGFR(IIIc). By contrast, epithelial-like OSCC cells showed opposite expression profiles for these proteins and constitutive expression of the IIIb-isoform of FGFR2, FGFR2(IIIb). Importantly, ERK1/2 was constitutively phosphorylated through FGFR1(IIIc), which was activated by factors secreted autonomously by mesenchymal-like OSCC cells and involved in sustained high-level expression of ZEB1. Antagonizing FGFR1 with either inhibitors or siRNAs considerably repressed ZEB1 expression and restored epithelial-like traits. Therefore, autocrine FGF–FGFR(IIIc) signaling appears to be responsible for sustaining ZEB1/2 at high levels and the EMT phenotype in OSCC cells."

Early data suggested that calcium (Ca 2+ ) signals could influence mitosis, but these have hitherto not been observed in mammalian cells. Here, we reveal a prolonged yet spatially restricted Ca 2+ signal at the centrosomes of actively dividing cells. Local buffering of the centrosomal Ca 2+ signals, by flash photolysis of the caged Ca 2+ chelator diazo‐2‐acetoxymethyl ester, arrests mitosis. We also provide evidence that this Ca 2+ signal emanates from the endoplasmic reticulum. In summary, we characterize a unique centrosomal Ca 2+ signal as a functionally essential input into mitosis.—Helassa, N., Nugues, C., Rajamanoharan, D., Burgoyne, R. D., Haynes, L. P.

Here we report that membrane depolarization triggered IKC intracellular signals mediated by small GTPases of the Ras subfamily and protein kinase B (Akt) to advance the development of filopodia and lamellipodia in Chinese hamster ovary cells, stimulate their motility, and enhance neurite outgrowth in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells. Five KCNB1 mutants (L211P, R312H G379R, G381R, and F416L) linked to severe infancy or early‐onset epileptic encephalopathy exhibited markedly defective conduction. However, although L211P, G379R, and G381R normally engaged Ras/Akt and stimulated cell migration, R312H and F416L failed to activate Ras/Akt signaling and did not enhance cell migration. Taken together, these data suggest that IKCs modulate cellular plasticity via Ras and Akt signaling. As such, defective IKCs may cause epilepsy through mechanisms other than dysregulated excitability such as, for example, abnormal neuronal development and resulting synaptic connectivity.—Yu, W., Shin, M.

It is frequently used in topical preparations, i.e., ointments, for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. There is an increasing number of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains that harbour plasmid-borne fusB/far1 or fusC that is localised on SCC elements. In this study we examined a series of related CC30-MRSA isolates from the Arabian Gulf countries that presented with SCCmec elements and fusC, including a variant that-to the best of our knowledge-has not yet formally been described. It consisted of a class B mec complex and ccrA/B-4 genes. The fusidic acid resistance gene fusC was present, but contrary to the previously sequenced element of HDE288, it was not accompanied by tirS. This element was identified in CC30 MRSA from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that usually also harbour the Panton-Valentin leukocidin (PVL) genes. It was also identified in CC8 and ST834 isolates. In addition, further CC30 MRSA strains with other SCCmec VI elements harbouring fusC were found to circulate in the Arabian Gulf region. It can be assumed that MRSA strains with SCCmec elements that include fusC have a selective advantage in both hospital and community settings warranting a review of the use of topical antibiotics and indicating the necessity of reducing over-the-counter sale of antibiotics, including fusidic acid, without prescription."

This is the first study to provide a broad survey of genetic diversity, population structure and migration patterns of P. pelagicus along the Vietnamese coastline. The crab samples were collected from northern, central and southern Vietnam. Here, we used a panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). After removing 32 outlier loci, 306 putatively neutral SNPs from 96 individuals were used to assess fine-scale population structure of blue swimming crab. The mean observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) per locus was 0.196 and 0.223, respectively. Pairwise Fst and hierarchical AMOVA supported significant differentiation of central and northern from southern populations (P<0.01). Population structure analyses revealed that P. pelagicus in the south is a separate fisheries unit from the north and center. Contemporary migration patterns supported high migration between northern and central populations and restricted genetic exchange within the southern population. In contrast, historic gene flow provides strong evidence for single panmictic population. The results are useful for understanding current status of P. pelagicus in the wild under an environment changing due to natural and anthropogenic stresses, with implications for fisheries management."
https://openalex.org/W2987219324,"Macrophages and their initiation of acute inflammation have been defined to be functionally important in tissue repair and regeneration. In injury-induced production of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which has been described as a pleiotropic protein that participates in multiple cellular and biologic processes, it is unknown whether it is involved in the regulation of macrophage events during the epimorphic regeneration. In the model of gecko tail amputation, the protein levels of gecko MIF (gMIF) have been determined to be significantly increased in the nerve cells of the spinal cord in association with the recruitment of macrophages to the lesion site. gMIF has been shown to interact with the CD74 receptor to promote the migration of macrophages through activation of Ras homolog gene family member A and to trigger inflammatory responses through MAPK signaling pathways. The determination of microsphere phagocytosis also indicated that gMIF could enhance macrophage phagocytosis. gMIF-mediated recruitment and activation of macrophages have been found to be necessary for gecko tail regeneration, as evidenced by the depletion of macrophages using clodronate liposomes. The results present a novel function of MIF during the epimorphic regeneration, which is beneficial for insights into its pleiotropic property.-Wang, Y., Wei, S., Song, H., Zhang, X., Wang, W., Du, N., Song, T., Liang, H., Chen, X., Wang, Y.

The trophic structure of both ecosystems was assessed using carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N), and sulfur (δ34S) stable isotopes. The δ13C ranged from -40.8 to -12.1‰, revealing diverse carbon sources and its assimilation via Calvin-Benson-Bassham and the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycles. The δ15N values were between -12.5 and 18.3‰, corresponding to primary and secondary consumers. The δ34S values fluctuated from -36.2 to 15.1‰, indicating the sulfide assimilation of biogenic, magmatic, and photosynthetic sources. In PB high-temperature vents, primary consumers including symbiont-bearing, bacterivores and filter-feeders predominated. The secondary consumers within the scavengers/detritivores and predator guilds were scarce. The siboglinid Oasisia aff alvinae dominated the macrofauna assemblage at PB, but rather than playing a trophic role, it provides a substrate to vent dwellers. In PTF low-temperature vents, only symbiont-bearing primary consumers were analyzed, displaying the lowest δ34S values. This assemblage was dominated by the coexisting siboglinids Lamellibrachia barhami and Escarpia spicata. δ34S values allowed to distinguish between PB and PTF vent communities, to exclude the presence of methanotrophic organisms, and the detection of photosynthetic organic matter input."
https://openalex.org/W2989436896,"Rice blast, caused by the ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is a destructive disease of rice and responsible for causing extensive damage to the crop. Pi54, a dominant blast resistance gene cloned from rice line Tetep, imparts a broad spectrum resistance against various M. oryzae isolates. Many of its alleles have been explored from wild Oryza species and landraces whose sequences are available in the public domain. Its cognate effector gene AvrPi54 has also been cloned from M. oryzae. Complying with the Flor's gene-for-gene system, Pi54 protein interacts with AvrPi54 protein following fungal invasion leading to the resistance responses in rice cell that prevents the disease development. In the present study Pi54 alleles from 72 rice lines were used to understand the interaction of Pi54 (R) proteins with AvrPi54 (Avr) protein. The physiochemical properties of these proteins varied due to the nucleotide level polymorphism. The ab initio tertiary structures of these R- and Avr- proteins were generated and subjected to the in silico interaction. In this interaction, the residues in the LRR region of R- proteins were shown to interact with the Avr protein. These R proteins were found to have variable strengths of binding due to the differential spatial arrangements of their amino acid residues. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations were performed for the protein pairs that showed stronger interaction than Pi54tetep (original Pi54 from Tetep) protein. We found these proteins were forming h-bond during simulation which indicated an effective binding. The root mean square deviation values and potential energy values were stable during simulation which validated the docking results. From the interaction studies and the molecular dynamics simulations, we concluded that the AvrPi54 protein interacts directly with the resistant Pi54 proteins through the LRR region of Pi54 proteins. Some of the Pi54 proteins from the landraces namely Casebatta, Tadukan, Varun dhan, Govind, Acharmita, HPR-2083, Budda, Jatto, MTU-4870, Dobeja-1, CN-1789, Indira sona, Kulanji pille and Motebangarkaddi cultivars show stronger binding with the AvrPi54 protein, thus these alleles can be effectively used for the rice blast resistance breeding program in future."

Using an inhibitory avoidance task, we analyzed the dynamic changes in learning-induced E/I synaptic plasticity. The training strengthened GABAA receptor-mediated synapses within 1 min, peaked at 10 min, and lasted for over 60 min. The intracellular loop (Ser408-409) of GABAA receptor β3 subunit was also phosphorylated within 1 min of training. As the results of strengthening of α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptor-mediated synapses, CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibited broad diversity of E/I synaptic currents within 5 min. Moreover, presynaptic glutamate release probability at basal dendrites also increased within 5 min. To further quantify the diversified E/I synaptic currents, we calculated self-entropy (bit) for individual neurons. The neurons showed individual levels of the parameter, which rapidly increased within 1 min of training and maintained for over 60 min. These results suggest that learning-induced synaptic plasticity is critical immediately following encoding rather than during the retrieval phase of the learning. Understanding the temporal dynamics along with the quantification of synaptic diversity would be necessary to identify a failure point for learning-promoted plasticity in cognitive disorders.-Sakimoto, Y., Kida, H., Mitsushima, D.

Polymorphisms in several circadian rhythm-related (clock) genes were associated with drug addiction. This study aims to search for associations between 895 variants in 39 circadian rhythm-related genes and opioid addiction (OUD). Genotyping was performed with the Smokescreen® array. Ancestry was verified by principal/MDS component analysis and the sample was limited to European Americans (EA) (OUD; n = 435, controls; n = 138). Nominally significant associations (p < 0.01) were detected for several variants in genes encoding vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (VIPR2), period circadian regulator 2 (PER2), casein kinase 1 epsilon (CSNK1E), and activator of transcription and developmental regulator (AUTS2), but no signal survived correction for multiple testing. There was intriguing association signal for the untranslated region (3’ UTR) variant rs885863 in VIPR2, (p = .0065; OR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.31–0.51). The result was corroborated in an independent EA OUD sample (n = 398, p = 0.0036; for the combined samples). Notably, this SNP is an expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) for VIPR2 and a long intergenic non-coding RNA, lincRNA 689, in a tissue-specific manner, based on the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an important peptide of light-activated suprachiasmatic nucleus cells. It regulates diverse physiological processes including circadian rhythms, learning and memory, and stress response. This is the first report of an association of a VIPR2 variant and OUD.

https://openalex.org/W2986066610,"Cytarabine (AraC) is the mainstay for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Although complete remission is observed in a large proportion of patients, relapse occurs in almost all the cases. The chemotherapeutic action of AraC derives from its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis by the replicative polymerases (Pols); the replicative Pols can insert AraCTP at the 3′ terminus of the nascent DNA strand, but they are blocked at extending synthesis from AraC. By extending synthesis from the 3′-terminal AraC and by replicating through AraC that becomes incorporated into DNA, translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA Pols could reduce the effectiveness of AraC in chemotherapy. Here we identify the TLS Pols required for replicating through the AraC templating residue and determine their error-proneness. We provide evidence that TLS makes a consequential contribution to the replication of AraC-damaged DNA; that TLS through AraC is conducted by three different pathways dependent upon Polη, Polι, and Polν, respectively; and that TLS by all these Pols incurs considerable mutagenesis. The prominent role of TLS in promoting proficient and mutagenic replication through AraC suggests that TLS inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia patients would increase the effectiveness of AraC chemotherapy; and by reducing mutation formation, TLS inhibition may dampen the emergence of drug-resistant tumors and thereby the high incidence of relapse in AraC-treated patients."

Analysis was done using EPI Info 7.21 software (CDC Atlanta Georgia).A total of 397(99.3%) completely filled questionnaires were collated and analysed. Approximately 71% of the health facilities closest to the respondents had maternity services. It took at least 1 hour for 80.9% of the respondents to access health facilities with maternity services. Most (60.2%) of the respondents had at least one antenatal clinic attendance and majority of them did so at public hospitals. Approximately 43.8% of the respondents were delivered by the skilled birth attendants. The respondents' age and the couple's educational level, history of antenatal clinic attendance, distance of the health facility and availability of transport fare had a significant effect on delivery by skilled birth attendants. The common determinants of birth place were nearness of the health facilities, familiarity of healthcare providers, improved services, sudden labour onset and cost. Also 61.7% of the respondents chose to deliver in public health facilities due to favourable reasons but this could be hampered by the rudeness of some healthcare providers at such facilities. A significant proportion of private health facilities had unskilled manpower and shortage of drugs.A greater proportion of women will prefer to deliver in health facilities. However there are barriers to utilization of these facilities hence the need to address such barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2988248655,"Background The use of labor epidural analgesia has been associated with intrapartum fever, known as labor epidural associated fever (LEAF). LEAF is most commonly non-infectious in origin and associated with elevated inflammatory cytokines. Methods The LIFECODES pregnancy cohort was designed to prospectively collect data to evaluate the association of maternal inflammatory biomarkers with preterm birth in women who delivered between 2007 and 2008 at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Our secondary analysis of the data from the cohort identified 182 women for whom inflammatory biomarkers (i.e. interleukin-10, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and C-reactive protein) collected longitudinally over four prenatal visits was available. Maternal temperature and other clinical variables were abstracted from medical records. The primary outcome, the presence of LEAF, was defined as oral temperature ≥ 38°C (≥100.4°F) after epidural analgesia initiation. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the association between inflammatory biomarker concentrations and the odds of developing an intrapartum fever after adjusting for a number of potential confounders. Results Women who developed LEAF were more likely to have a longer duration of epidural analgesia, whereas women who did not develop LEAF were more likely to have induced labor and positive or unknown Group B Streptococcus colonization status. However, no differences were seen by nulliparity, mode of delivery, white blood cell count at admission, baseline temperature, length of rupture of membranes and number of cervical exams performed during labor. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression models did not provide evidence for or exclude an association between individual maternal inflammatory biomarkers and the odds of developing LEAF, regardless of visit time-period. Conclusion The predictive value of maternal inflammatory biomarkers measured during early- and mid-pregnancy for the risk of developing LEAF cannot be excluded."

This work led to the discovery of elementary particles known as quarks, and ultimately to the establishment of the standard model of particle physics. From the observation of a neutral kaon to the standard model."
https://openalex.org/W2986761808,"Restored tidal wetlands may provide important food web support for at-risk fish species in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta) of California, including Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Since many tidal wetland restoration projects are planned or have recently been constructed in the Delta, understanding the diversity and variability of wetland invertebrates that are fish prey items is of increasing importance. During this study, two different invertebrate sampling techniques were tested (leaf packs and sweep nets) in four habitat types within three different wetland areas to evaluate which sampling technique provided the most reliable metric of invertebrate abundance and community composition. Sweep nets provided a better measure of fish food availability than leaf packs and were better able to differentiate between habitat types. Generalized linear models showed submerged and floating vegetation had higher abundance and taxa richness than channel habitats or emergent vegetation. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance showed significantly different communities of invertebrates in different habitat types and in different wetlands, and point-biserial correlation coefficients found a greater number of mobile taxa associated with sweep nets. There were more taxa associated with vegetated habitats than channel habitats, and one area had more taxa associated with it than the other two areas. These results suggest that restoration sites that contain multiple habitat types may enhance fish invertebrate prey diversity and resilience. However, the effect of habitat diversity must be monitored as restoration sites develop to assess actual benefits to at-risk fish species."
https://openalex.org/W2986997954,"Within 2021, Norway intends to complete implementation of HPV DNA-based primary screening for cervical cancer for women 34-69 years, while continue cytology-based screening for women 25-33 years. Over the recent years, the incidence of cervical cancer has increased by 30% among women younger than 40 years. In this subset of women, nearly 30% were diagnosed with a normal smear, as most recent smear, prior the cancer diagnosis. This observation demands quality control of normal smears. The aim of this study was to assess increase in program sensitivity of CIN2+ after follow-up of women with false negative Pap-smears testing positive for a 3-type (-16, -18, -45) HPV mRNA test in a cohort design over one screening interval. 521 women, aged 23-39 years, and no prior history of CIN1+ or HSIL, with an ASC-US or worse smear (ASC-US+) and 1444 women with normal screening cytology comprised the study cohorts. The positivity rate for the 3-type HPV mRNA was 1.9% (28/1444). Rescreening revealed 23 women with ASC-US, two women with LSIL, two women with ASC-H, and one woman with AGUS. If the HPV mRNA-positivity rate and histology findings from samples rescreened were applied to all women with normal cytology, an estimated increase in screening sensitivity of 16.4% (95% CI:15.3-17.5) for CIN2+ and 17.3% (95% CI:16.2-18.4) for CIN3+ were achieved. By rescreening less than 2% of women with normal cytology positive for a 3-type HPV mRNA test, we achieved a significant increase in screening program sensitivity."
