https://openalex.org/W2109816625,"We describe the landscape of somatic genomic alterations based on multidimensional and comprehensive characterization of more than 500 glioblastoma tumors (GBMs). We identify several novel mutated genes as well as complex rearrangements of signature receptors, including EGFR and PDGFRA. TERT promoter mutations are shown to correlate with elevated mRNA expression, supporting a role in telomerase reactivation. Correlative analyses confirm that the survival advantage of the proneural subtype is conferred by the G-CIMP phenotype, and MGMT DNA methylation may be a predictive biomarker for treatment response only in classical subtype GBM. Integrative analysis of genomic and proteomic profiles challenges the notion of therapeutic inhibition of a pathway as an alternative to inhibition of the target itself. These data will facilitate the discovery of therapeutic and diagnostic target candidates, the validation of research and clinical observations and the generation of unanticipated hypotheses that can advance our molecular understanding of this lethal cancer."

Transcription factors bind DNA regulatory elements called enhancers, which play key roles in the control of cell-type-specific gene expression programs (Bulger and Groudine, 2011Bulger M. Groudine M.

A typical mammalian cell contains thousands of active enhancers, and it has been estimated that there may be ∼1 million enhancers active in all human cells (Bernstein et al., 2012Bernstein B.E.

It is important to further understand enhancers and their components because they control specific gene expression programs, and much disease-associated sequence variation occurs in these regulatory elements (Grossman et al., 2013Grossman S.R.

The set of enhancers that control any one cell’s gene expression program is probably best defined in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Co-occupancy of murine ESC genomic sites by the master transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog is highly predictive of enhancer activity (Chen et al., 2008Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L. Zhang W. Jiang J. et al.Integration of external signaling pathways with the core transcriptional network in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 133: 1106-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), and 8,794 enhancers have been identified in ESCs by using ChIP-seq data sets for Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Whyte et al., 2013Whyte W.A. Orlando D.A. Hnisz D. Abraham B.J. Lin C.Y. Kagey M.H. Rahl P.B. Lee T.I. Young R.A. Master transcription factors and mediator establish super-enhancers at key cell identity genes.Cell. 2013; 153: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A subset of these enhancers forms 231 unusual enhancer domains at most genes that control the pluripotent state; these super-enhancers consist of clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by five key ESC transcription factors and the Mediator coactivator (Whyte et al., 2013Whyte W.A. Orlando D.A. Hnisz D. Abraham B.J. Lin C.Y. Kagey M.H. Rahl P.B. Lee T.I. Young R.A. Master transcription factors and mediator establish super-enhancers at key cell identity genes.Cell. 2013; 153: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). There are many additional transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin regulators that contribute to the control of ESCs (Ng and Surani, 2011Ng H.H. Surani M.A. The transcriptional and signalling networks of pluripotency.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Orkin and Hochedlinger, 2011Orkin S.H.

Similarly, it would be useful to know if super-enhancers are transcribed, as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) have been proposed to contribute to enhancer activity (Lai et al., 2013Lai F. Orom U.A. Cesaroni M.

Super-enhancers are associated with key genes that control cell state in cells where they have been identified thus far, so identification of these domains in additional cell types could provide a valuable resource for further study of cellular control. We have generated a catalog of super-enhancers in 86 human cell and tissue types. These super-enhancers are associated with genes encoding cell-type-specific transcription factors and thus identify candidate master transcription factors for many cell types that should prove useful for further understanding transcriptional control of cell state and for reprogramming studies. Using this catalog, we find that DNA sequence variation associated with specific diseases is especially enriched in the super-enhancers of disease-relevant cells, suggesting that hypotheses regarding the role of specific cell types and genes in many diseases might be guided by knowledge of super-enhancers. Furthermore, tumor cells acquire super-enhancers at key oncogenes and at genes that function in the acquisition of hallmark capabilities in cancer, suggesting that these domains provide biomarkers for tumor-specific pathologies that may be valuable for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. We discuss the implications of these observations for future study of disease. Super-enhancers are clusters of enhancers—formed by binding of high levels of master transcription factors and Mediator coactivator—that drive high-level expression of genes encoding key regulators of cell identity (Figure 1A) (Whyte et al., 2013Whyte W.A. Orlando D.A. Hnisz D. Abraham B.J. Lin C.Y. Kagey M.H. Rahl P.B. Lee T.I. Young R.A. Master transcription factors and mediator establish super-enhancers at key cell identity genes.Cell. 2013; 153: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Five ESC transcription factors were previously shown to occupy super-enhancers (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Klf4, and Esrrb) (Whyte et al., 2013Whyte W.A. Orlando D.A. Hnisz D. Abraham B.J. Lin C.Y.

Surani M.A. The transcriptional and signalling networks of pluripotency.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Orkin and Hochedlinger, 2011Orkin S.H.

Control of the embryonic stem cell state.Cell. 2011; 144: 940-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We compiled ChIP-seq data for 15 additional transcription factors in ESCs, for which high-quality ChIP-seq data were available, and investigated whether they occupy enhancers defined by Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (OSN) co-occupancy (Whyte et al., 2013Whyte W.A. Orlando D.A. Hnisz D. Abraham B.J. Lin C.Y. Kagey M.H. Rahl P.B. Lee T.I. Young R.A. Master transcription factors and mediator establish super-enhancers at key cell identity genes.Cell. 2013; 153: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Table S1 available online). The analysis showed that six additional transcription factors (Nr5a2, Prdm14, Tcfcp2l1, Smad3, Stat3, and Tcf3) occupy both typical enhancers and super-enhancers and that all of these are enriched in super-enhancers (Figures 1B–1E). Each of these factors has previously been shown to play important roles in ESC biology (Ng and Surani, 2011Ng H.H. Surani M.A. The transcriptional and signalling networks of pluripotency.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Orkin and Hochedlinger, 2011Orkin S.H. Hochedlinger K.

Control of the embryonic stem cell state.Cell. 2011; 144: 940-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast, nine other transcription factors (c-Myc, CTCF, Zfx, Tbx3, YY1, Tfe3, Kap1/Zfp57, Smad1, and Ronin) were not similarly enriched in enhancers (Table S1) and instead occupied other regions of the genome such as promoter-proximal sites or sites that border topological domains (Figure S1A). It is particularly interesting that Smad3, Stat3, and Tcf3 are enriched in super-enhancer domains because these are transcription factor targets of the TGF-β-, LIF-, and Wnt-signaling pathways, respectively. Previous studies have shown that these transcription factors are recruited to enhancers formed by master transcription factors (Chen et al., 2008Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B.

Box plot whiskers extend to 1.5x the interquartile range. To assess whether the 11 transcription factors that are enriched at super-enhancers contribute to super-enhancer formation by binding to known DNA sequence motifs, we analyzed the frequency of these binding motifs at super-enhancer regions. For all nine transcription factors for which binding motifs are available, we found that the cognate motif showed significant enrichment at super-enhancer constituents relative to background expectation, and super-enhancers were enriched for these motifs compared to typical enhancers (Figures 1F, S1B, and S1C). These results suggest that the nine transcription factors contribute to super-enhancers by binding directly to their known DNA sequence motifs. Previous studies have described a model of core transcriptional regulatory circuitry that includes Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S.

The evidence that these and additional ESC transcription factors form super-enhancers that drive genes that are essential for control of cell identity suggests a revised model of transcriptional regulatory circuitry for ESCs (Figure 1G). This model contains an interconnected autoregulatory loop like that originally proposed for Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S.

Super-enhancers are occupied by unusually high levels of the Mediator coactivator (Whyte et al., 2013Whyte W.A. Orlando D.A. Hnisz D. Abraham B.J. Lin C.Y. Kagey M.H. Rahl P.B. Lee T.I. Young R.A.

It was notable that a broad spectrum of cofactors and chromatin regulators that are responsible for gene activation, enhancer looping, histone modification, and nucleosome remodeling are especially enriched in ESC super-enhancers. The Mediator coactivator binds Nipbl, which loads cohesin, thus facilitating looping of enhancers to the promoters of their target genes (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H. Newman J.J. Bilodeau S. Zhan Y.

https://openalex.org/W2016771009,"Activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway by microbial or self-DNA, as well as cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), results in the induction of numerous genes that suppress pathogen replication and facilitate adaptive immunity. However, sustained gene transcription is rigidly prevented to avoid lethal STING-dependent proinflammatory disease by mechanisms that remain unknown. We demonstrate here that, after autophagy-dependent STING delivery of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to endosomal/lysosomal compartments and activation of transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB, STING is subsequently phosphorylated by serine/threonine UNC-51-like kinase (ULK1/ATG1), and IRF3 function is suppressed. ULK1 activation occurred following disassociation from its repressor AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) and was elicited by CDNs generated by the cGAMP synthase, cGAS. Thus, although CDNs may initially facilitate STING function, they subsequently trigger negative-feedback control of STING activity, thus preventing the persistent transcription of innate immune genes."
https://openalex.org/W1975215468,"The pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) is expressed in cancer and plays a role in regulating anabolic metabolism. To determine whether PKM2 is required for tumor formation or growth, we generated mice with a conditional allele that abolishes PKM2 expression without disrupting PKM1 expression. PKM2 deletion accelerated mammary tumor formation in a Brca1-loss-driven model of breast cancer. PKM2 null tumors displayed heterogeneous PKM1 expression, with PKM1 found in nonproliferating tumor cells and no detectable pyruvate kinase expression in proliferating cells. This suggests that PKM2 is not necessary for tumor cell proliferation and implies that the inactive state of PKM2 is associated with the proliferating cell population within tumors, whereas nonproliferating tumor cells require active pyruvate kinase. Consistent with these findings, variable PKM2 expression and heterozygous PKM2 mutations are found in human tumors. These data suggest that regulation of PKM2 activity supports the different metabolic requirements of proliferating and nonproliferating tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2102944297,"Proliferation of the self-renewing epithelium of the gastric corpus occurs almost exclusively in the isthmus of the glands, from where cells migrate bidirectionally toward pit and base. The isthmus is therefore generally viewed as the stem cell zone. We find that the stem cell marker Troy is expressed at the gland base by a small subpopulation of fully differentiated chief cells. By lineage tracing with a Troy-eGFP-ires-CreERT2 allele, single marked chief cells are shown to generate entirely labeled gastric units over periods of months. This phenomenon accelerates upon tissue damage. Troy(+) chief cells can be cultured to generate long-lived gastric organoids. Troy marks a specific subset of chief cells that display plasticity in that they are capable of replenishing entire gastric units, essentially serving as quiescent ""reserve"" stem cells. These observations challenge the notion that stem cell hierarchies represent a ""one-way street."""
https://openalex.org/W2164580633,"We have applied a super-resolution fluorescence imaging method, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), to visualize the structure of functional telomeres and telomeres rendered dysfunctional through removal of shelterin proteins. The STORM images showed that functional telomeres frequently exhibit a t-loop configuration. Conditional deletion of individual components of shelterin showed that TRF2 was required for the formation and/or maintenance of t-loops, whereas deletion of TRF1, Rap1, or the POT1 proteins (POT1a and POT1b) had no effect on the frequency of t-loop occurrence. Within the shelterin complex, TRF2 uniquely serves to protect telomeres from two pathways that are initiated on free DNA ends: classical nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and ATM-dependent DNA damage signaling. The TRF2-dependent remodeling of telomeres into t-loop structures, which sequester the ends of chromosomes, can explain why NHEJ and the ATM signaling pathway are repressed when TRF2 is present."

However, it was never established that premalignant lesions actually contain tumor progenitors that give rise to cancer. Here, we describe isolation and characterization of HCC progenitor cells (HcPCs) from different mouse HCC models. Unlike fully malignant HCC, HcPCs give rise to cancer only when introduced into a liver undergoing chronic damage and compensatory proliferation. Although HcPCs exhibit a similar transcriptomic profile to bipotential hepatobiliary progenitors, the latter do not give rise to tumors. Cells resembling HcPCs reside within dysplastic lesions that appear several months before HCC nodules. Unlike early hepatocarcinogenesis, which depends on paracrine IL-6 production by inflammatory cells, due to upregulation of LIN28 expression, HcPCs had acquired autocrine IL-6 signaling that stimulates their in vivo growth and malignant progression. This may be a general mechanism that drives other IL-6-producing malignancies."

The primary cilium is an antenna-like projection of the cell that consists of nine microtubule doublets surrounded by ciliary membrane (CM). The primary cilium is nucleated at its base by the basal body, consisting of the eldest centriole in the cell—the mother centriole—with associated appendage proteins that dock it to the plasma membrane (Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2012Garcia-Gonzalo F.R.

Although the CM is continuous with the plasma membrane, entry of membrane proteins into the cilium is restricted (Nachury et al., 2010Nachury M.V. Seeley E.S. Jin H.

Thus, the primary cilium forms a separate cell compartment, providing a platform for several extracellular signals, such as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), an important regulator of proliferation and embryonic patterning (Goetz and Anderson, 2010Goetz S.C.

A generally accepted concept is that primary cilia are disassembled prior to mitosis so that the centrioles can function at the poles of the mitotic spindle (Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2012Garcia-Gonzalo F.R.

At the end of cell division, the daughter centriole of the previous cell cycle matures into a new mother centriole and will, as the old mother centriole, nucleate a new cilium in early G1 (Nigg and Stearns, 2011Nigg E.A. Stearns T. The centrosome cycle: Centriole biogenesis, duplication and inherent asymmetries.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1154-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In the developing neocortex, a primary cilium extends from the apical membrane of epithelial neural stem cells, called apical progenitors (APs), into the lateral ventricle (Louvi and Grove, 2011Louvi A. Grove E.A. Cilia in the CNS: the quiet organelle claims center stage.Neuron. 2011; 69: 1046-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Here, the cilium is able to detect signals present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Lehtinen and Walsh, 2011Lehtinen M.K. Walsh C.A. Neurogenesis at the brain-cerebrospinal fluid interface.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 653-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Upon onset of neurogenesis, APs switch from symmetric proliferative divisions to mainly asymmetric neurogenic divisions (Götz and Huttner, 2005Götz M. Huttner W.B.

These APs produce neurons either directly or via fate-restricted basal progenitors that delaminate from the ventricular surface. Asymmetric inheritance of the centrosome containing the mother centriole into one daughter cell is linked to maintenance of stem cell character in the Drosophila germline and the developing mouse neocortex (Pelletier and Yamashita, 2012Pelletier L.

Lian W.N. Vallee R.B. Shi S.H. Asymmetric centrosome inheritance maintains neural progenitors in the neocortex.Nature. 2009; 461: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In addition, in cultured cells, the daughter cell that inherits the mother centriole reassembles a cilium earlier than its sister cell (Anderson and Stearns, 2009Anderson C.T. Stearns T. Centriole age underlies asynchronous primary cilium growth in mammalian cells.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1498-1502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Asynchronous cilium reformation was also observed in AP divisions in the mouse neural tube by live imaging (Piotrowska-Nitsche and Caspary, 2012Piotrowska-Nitsche K. Caspary T. Live imaging of individual cell divisions in mouse neuroepithelium shows asymmetry in cilium formation and Sonic hedgehog response.Cilia. 2012; 1: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This asynchrony differentially exposes the daughter cells to primary cilium-transmitted signals (Anderson and Stearns, 2009Anderson C.T. Stearns T.

Biol. 2009; 19: 1498-1502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, Piotrowska-Nitsche and Caspary, 2012Piotrowska-Nitsche K. Caspary T. Live imaging of individual cell divisions in mouse neuroepithelium shows asymmetry in cilium formation and Sonic hedgehog response.Cilia. 2012; 1: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These studies support the notion that inheritance of centrosome-associated structures is involved in asymmetric regulation of cell fate between daughter cells. The fate of one such structure, the CM, upon entry into mitosis is currently unknown. Here, we have investigated the fate of the CM upon division of mouse embryonic neocortical stem cells and cells in culture. Our findings indicate that, contrary to previous concepts, primary cilia are not completely disassembled prior to mitosis. Our study uncovers a yet unknown feature of cell division with relevance for asymmetric daughter cell behavior that explains the previously reported asynchrony in cilium re-establishment and signaling between daughter cells. The small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor-like 13b (Arl13b) specifically associates with the CM via a palmitoyl moiety (Cevik et al., 2010Cevik S. Hori Y. Kaplan O.I. Kida K. Toivenon T.

Caspary T. Disrupted dorsal neural tube BMP signaling in the cilia mutant Arl13b hnn stems from abnormal Shh signaling.Dev. Biol. 2011; 355: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As described previously, we found that Arl13b marks primary cilia protruding from the apical membrane of APs in the developing mouse cortex (Figure 1A). In mitotic APs, we detected Arl13b protein near one of the centrosomes of the spindle (Figure 1B). This centrosomal localization of Arl13b was observed throughout mitosis in most dividing APs (Figures 1B and 1E). We used electron microscopy (EM) to analyze the structural basis of this subcellular Arl13b localization. Using conventional transmission EM analysis (Figure 1C and Figure S1 available online) as well as serial-block-face scanning EM (SBF-SEM; Figure 1F), we identified membraneous structures in close association with one centriole of one spindle pole in the majority of mitotic APs. These membrane structures characteristically appeared as membranes enclosed by, or budding into, a larger membrane vesicle (Figures 1C and S1). Moreover, the inner membrane appeared to be anchored to the centriole via appendages similar to transitional fibers docking the basal body in interphase cells to the plasma membrane, suggesting that these structures constitute an intracellular ciliary remnant (CR) (Figure S1). Indeed, the Arl13b-positive (Arl13b+) puncta seen in immunofluorescence were observed to correspond to centriole-attached immunogold-labeled membrane structures (Figure 1D). Arl13b was mainly localized to the inner membrane of these structures (Figures S2A–S2E). In some cases, the Arl13b+ membrane appeared fragmented within the outer, surrounding membrane (Figure S2E). We did not observe specific Arl13b immunoreactivity directly on centrioles. Importantly, the frequency of centriole-associated membranes in mitotic APs as detected by SBF-SEM (Figure 1F) was comparable to that of centrosome-associated Arl13b as detected by immunofluorescence (Figure 1E). Taken together, these data show that, in most mitotic APs, an intracellular Arl13b+ CM is attached to a centriole via appendages similar to those found in interphase cilia.Figure S2Arl13b Is Localized to the Centriole-Attached Intracellular Membrane in Mitotic APs and HEK293T Cells, Related to Figures 1 and 4Show full captionTransmission EM of (E12.5 dorsal telencephalon) mitotic APs (A-E) or HEK293T cells (F, G) that are immunogold-labeled for Arl13b either by pre-embedding (Arl13bAg; A, B, F, G) or postembedding labeling (Arl13b10nm; C, D, E).

Scalebars, overview images 1 μm; magnifications 100 nm. To corroborate the ciliary identity of the Arl13b+ membrane, we made use of two well-known ciliary transmembrane proteins, namely, the somatostatin receptor 3 (Sstr3) and the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor 5HT6 (Berbari et al., 2008Berbari N.F. Johnson A.D. Lewis J.S. Askwith C.C. Mykytyn K. Identification of ciliary localization sequences within the third intracellular loop of G protein-coupled receptors.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We electroporated DNA constructs encoding EGFP-tagged versions of these proteins into the developing mouse dorsolateral telencephalon at E12.5 and analyzed dividing APs at E13.5. As expected, Sstr3-EGFP localized specifically to the cilia of APs at interphase (Figure 2A). In mitotic APs, Sstr3-EGFP was localized close to one of the centrosomes and seemed to enclose the Arl13b+ dot (Figure 2B). A similar localization was observed for 5HT6-EGFP (data not shown). These results strengthen our conclusion that the Arl13b+ membrane has ciliary identity. We next investigated whether the Arl13b+ membrane represents de novo synthesized CM or an internalized membrane-containing remnant of the primary cilium present during interphase. To explore the latter, we analyzed whether the Arl13b+ dot contains CM that was internalized from the cell surface at the onset of mitosis. We adopted a cell-surface biotinylation approach that has previously been widely used in endocytosis and recycling studies (Figure 2C). The apical surface of the telencephalon was biotinylated at 4°C using the membrane-impermeable Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Figure 2C). Control samples kept at 4°C to prevent membrane internalization showed biotinylation (as detected by fluorescent streptavidin) of the apical membrane and CM of APs (Figures 2D, S3A, and S3B ). No biotinylated membrane was detected at the centrosome of mitotic APs in the control samples (Figures 2D, 2G, S3C, S3D, and S3F). In contrast, analysis of mitotic APs in samples that were chased at 37°C for up to 3 hr showed the presence of multiple intracellular biotinylated membrane dots. Only one of these overlapped with the intracellular centrosome-associated Arl13b+ membrane (Figures 2E, 2F, 2H, 2I, and S3H). These results show that the latter membrane had been internalized from the cell surface. Further support for this conclusion was obtained by SBF-SEM. This revealed an entire primary cilium in a deep plasma membrane invagination of an AP at the G2-M phase transition, apparently undergoing endocytosis (Movie S1). The above data suggest that, in contrast to the generally accepted concept that primary cilia are completely disassembled for mitosis, the CM remains attached to the basal body throughout mitosis. To further corroborate this, we examined the localization of the CM relative to the mature centriole-specific proteins Cep164 (Graser et al., 2007Graser S. Stierhof Y.D. Lavoie S.B. Gassner O.S.

Ninein localizes at the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole as well as the proximal end of both mother and daughter centrioles (Mogensen et al., 2000Mogensen M.M. Malik A. Piel M. Bouckson-Castaing V. Bornens M. Microtubule minus-end anchorage at centrosomal and non-centrosomal sites: the role of ninein.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3013-3023PubMed Google Scholar). Cep164 and ninein are retained at the older mother centriole during mitosis (Graser et al., 2007Graser S. Stierhof Y.D. Lavoie S.B. Gassner O.S. Lamla S. Le Clech M. Nigg E.A.

Furthermore, the original daughter centriole slowly accumulates these proteins as it matures into a new mother centriole during mitosis. As expected, EGFP-tagged Cep164 and ninein were localized at the distal end of the basal body (Figures 3A, left, and 3C, left). Consistent with previous reports (Graser et al., 2007Graser S.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3013-3023PubMed Google Scholar), EGFP-Cep164 and EGFP-ninein showed a difference in signal intensity between the two poles of the mitotic spindle (Figures 3A, middle and right, 3B, 3C, right, 3D, and 3E). As this signal difference very likely reflects the different age of the centrioles, we assume that the centrosome containing the highest levels of Cep164 and ninein contains the older mother centriole. Arl13b immunofluorescence showed that the intracellular Arl13b+ CM was associated with the older mother centriole in the majority of mitotic APs (Figures 3A, middle and right, 3B, 3C, right, 3D, and 3F). Together with the EM observations (Figures 1C and S1), these data indicate that the attachment of the CM to the basal body through the distal appendages is maintained during mitosis. We next investigated whether persistence of centrosome-associated CM during mitosis is present in cell types other than APs. To this end, we analyzed Arl13b localization in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) and mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro2a) cells. About 25% of HEK293T cells carried an Arl13b+ primary cilium in interphase (Figures 4A and 4B ). Similarly, about 25% of mitotic HEK293T cells showed Arl13b immunofluorescence near one centrosome (Figures 4B and 4C). EM immunolocalization confirmed the presence of Arl13b+ CM in close vicinity to a centriole (Figures S2F and S2G), similar to what was observed in mitotic APs (Figures S2A–S2E). Similar findings were obtained by Arl13b immunofluorescence of Neuro2a cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the occurrence of a CR in mitotic cells is not limited to embryonic neural stem cells but occurs in a variety of cell types. Previous studies have demonstrated a link between old mother centriole inheritance and asynchronous cilium reformation (Anderson and Stearns, 2009Anderson C.T. Stearns T. Centriole age underlies asynchronous primary cilium growth in mammalian cells.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1498-1502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, Piotrowska-Nitsche and Caspary, 2012Piotrowska-Nitsche K. Caspary T. Live imaging of individual cell divisions in mouse neuroepithelium shows asymmetry in cilium formation and Sonic hedgehog response.Cilia. 2012; 1: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated inheritance of the CR and the timing of cilium reformation in pairs of daughter cells by live imaging (Figures 4D and S4; Movie S2). Imaging of interphase HEK293T cells showed shortening of the cilium (monitored using fluorescent protein-tagged Arl13b) prior to entry into mitosis (Figure 4D; Movie S2). Upon entry into mitosis, the CM was internalized together with one of the centrosomes (Figure S5A). This CR was asymmetrically inherited by one daughter cell in most divisions (Figures 4D, 4E, S4, and S5A; Movie S2). Subsequently, a cilium was reformed within a few hours in this daughter cell (daughter cell 1; Figures 4D–4F, S4, and S5A; Movie S2). In contrast, only a few daughter cells that had not inherited the CR (daughter cell 2) showed cilium reformation within the time of observation (Figures 4D–4F and S4), suggesting that these cells formed a cilium either much later or not at all. Comparison of the ciliary reassembly times between CR-inheriting versus noninheriting daughter cells showed that ciliary reformation occurred earlier in the former (Figure 4F). We obtained similar observations by live imaging of Neuro2a cells (data not shown). In addition, we corroborated the Arl13b live imaging observations by using Sstr3-EGFP as another marker of the CM in dividing HEK293T cells (Figure S5B). Together, these data demonstrate that inheritance of the CR is linked to earlier reassembly of the cilium in early G1 phase after mitosis. At the onset of neurogenesis, APs switch from symmetric to asymmetric divisions. We wondered whether asymmetric CR inheritance is a hallmark of dividing APs at both preneurogenic and neurogenic stages. Therefore, we examined the localization of Arl13b relative to the centrosomes in mitotic APs at several developmental stages (Figure 5). Prior to the onset of neurogenesis, as well as during early neurogenesis, Arl13b was localized near one centrosome in most APs (Figures 5A, top-right panel; 5B, 5C, and 5F, purple). Moreover, a subset of mitotic APs showed weak Arl13b staining next to the second centrosome as well (Figures 5A, bottom-right panel, 5B, 5C, and 5F, red). In contrast, at later neurogenic stages, most mitotic APs showed Arl13b localization at some distance from either centrosome (Figures 5A, bottom-left panel, 5D–5F, yellow). Upon surface biotinylation and chase, we observed that this noncentrosomal form of CM in mitotic APs contains biotinylated membrane derived from the surface of the cell (Figures S3E and S3G), similar to centrosome-associated CM. Together, these data show that persistence of the CR throughout mitosis occurs most frequently at preneurogenic and early neurogenic stages. In addition, they suggest that, as neurogenesis progresses, the CM can lose its attachment to the old mother centriole during mitosis. We next investigated the asymmetric inheritance of the CR in AP divisions by live imaging of organotypic slices of, and acutely dissociated cells derived from, dorsolateral telencephalon (Figures 6A–6C). Prior to imaging, APs were electroporated in utero with a combination of ciliary, centrosomal, and membrane markers. In organotypic slices, we observed that the Arl13b+ CM was internalized at the G2-M phase transition, persisted intracellularly through mitosis, and was asymmetrically inherited by one daughter cell (Figure 6A). In order to study the relationship between CR inheritance and the timing of cilium reassembly in greater detail, we monitored divisions of single dissociated APs and their progeny (Figures 6B–6F and S6A). First, we found that, similar to what we had observed in fixed tissue (Figure 5), half of the dividing APs showed asymmetric CR inheritance by one daughter at early neurogenesis (E12.5; Figures 6B and 6D, left, purple; Movie S3). The other APs showed (1) cilium disassembly followed by CM degradation prior to the onset of mitosis, as suggested by the loss of the Arl13b signal (Figure 6D, left, blue) or, in a few cases, either (2) CM degradation during mitosis (Figures 6C and 6D, left, green; Movie S4), or (3) dissociation of the CM from the centrosome during mitosis followed by inheritance by one daughter cell (Figure 6D, left, yellow; Movie S5). At later stages of neurogenesis, fewer AP divisions showed CR inheritance (E14.5–E15.5 Figure 6D, right, purple). At the same time, an increased proportion of dividing APs showed either CM degradation (Figure 6D, right, green), or its dissociation from the centrosome (Figure 6D, right, yellow), during mitosis. Similar observations were made using Sstr3-EGFP as a marker of CM (Figure S6A). Next, we compared cilium reformation in the daughter cells of AP divisions with or without CR inheritance (Figures 6E and S6A). In divisions with asymmetric CR inheritance, the CR-inheriting daughter cell reformed a cilium significantly earlier than its noninheriting sister cell, both at early and midneurogenic stages (Figure 6E, purple). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the timing of cilium reformation between daughter cells of divisions without CR inheritance (due to CM degradation; Figure 6E, green and blue). Comparing all CM-inheriting cells with all noninheriting cells, cilium reformation occurred about three times earlier in the former (62.2 ± 10.3 min versus 178.7 ± 18.9 min; Figure 6F). Interestingly, daughter cells inheriting noncentrosomal CM, which disappeared shortly thereafter, reformed a cilium later (151.2 ± 41.3 min; Figure 6F; Movie S5) than daughter cells that inherited a centrosomal CM. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the asymmetric CR inheritance followed by earlier cilium reassembly occurs also in primary embryonic neural stem cells. Moreover, the findings that daughter cells without CM or with noncentrosomal CM show delayed cilium reassembly, although one of the daughters contains the old mother centriole, indicate that inheritance of centrosome-associated CM underlies the earlier cilium reassembly. Previous studies have demonstrated that asynchronous cilium reformation is linked to differential ciliary signaling between daughter cells (Anderson and Stearns, 2009Anderson C.T. Stearns T.

However, the nature, generation, and interpretation of attractant gradients are poorly understood. Using a GFP fusion and a signaling sensor, we analyzed the distribution of the attractant chemokine Sdf1 during migration of the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium, a cohort of about 200 cells that migrates over a stripe of cells uniformly expressing sdf1. We find that a small fraction of the total Sdf1 pool is available to signal and induces a linear Sdf1-signaling gradient across the primordium. This signaling gradient is initiated at the rear of the primordium, equilibrates across the primordium within 200 min, and operates near steady state. The rear of the primordium generates this gradient through continuous sequestration of Sdf1 protein by the alternate Sdf1-receptor Cxcr7. Modeling shows that this is a physically plausible scenario."

However, little is known about the extracellular cues that pattern complex dendrite morphologies. In the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the sensory neuron PVD establishes stereotypical, highly branched dendrite morphology. Here, we report the identification of a tripartite ligand-receptor complex of membrane adhesion molecules that is both necessary and sufficient to instruct spatially restricted growth and branching of PVD dendrites. The ligand complex SAX-7/L1CAM and MNR-1 function at defined locations in the surrounding hypodermal tissue, whereas DMA-1 acts as the cognate receptor on PVD. Mutations in this complex lead to dramatic defects in the formation, stabilization, and organization of the dendritic arbor. Ectopic expression of SAX-7 and MNR-1 generates a predictable, unnaturally patterned dendritic tree in a DMA-1-dependent manner.

Mathematical analysis revealed principles that may guide stimulus-specific inhibition of signaling hubs, even in the absence of detailed mathematical models. Using the NFκB signaling module as a test bed, we identified perturbations that selectively affect the response to cytokines or pathogen components.

The mammalian main olfactory epithelium (MOE) is characterized by extreme diversity of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), each defined by the expression of a single olfactory receptor (OR) allele. In the mouse, the expressed OR is selected, in a monogenic, monoallelic and seemingly stochastic fashion (Chess et al., 1994Chess A. Simon I. Cedar H. Axel R. Allelic inactivation regulates olfactory receptor gene expression.Cell. 1994; 78: 823-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) from a repertoire of more than 1,000 genes (Buck and Axel, 1991Buck L.

Lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays a key role in this epigenetic switch because it catalyzes the removal of repressive lysine 9 methyl marks from histone H3 on the chosen OR allele (Lyons et al., 2013Lyons D.B.

Importantly, the subsequent downregulation of LSD1 in response to OR expression prevents the desilencing of additional ORs and stabilizes the expression of the activated allele revealing that LSD1 is the target of an OR-elicited feedback (Fleischmann et al., 2013Fleischmann A.

The observation that the expression of OR protein causes the downregulation of LSD1 (Lyons et al., 2013Lyons D.B. Allen W.E. Goh T. Tsai L. Barnea G. Lomvardas S. An epigenetic trap stabilizes singular olfactory receptor expression.Cell. 2013; 154: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and, therefore, the stabilization of OR choice poses significant questions regarding the cellular mechanisms that elicit this feedback. OR gene activation induces expression of Adenylyl Cyclase 3 (Adcy3), which then signals for the downregulation of LSD1, providing a link between OR and LSD1 expression (Lyons et al., 2013Lyons D.B. Allen W.E. Goh T. Tsai L. Barnea G. Lomvardas S. An epigenetic trap stabilizes singular olfactory receptor expression.Cell. 2013; 154: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, these results do not explain how an OR is detected by the neuron in the first place; Adcy3 plays a central role in the stabilization of OR choice, however, it is unlikely to be a “first responder” or initiator of the feedback because its expression relies upon OR expression. Therefore, a central question toward the understanding of the OR feedback signal is how ORs are detected by the OSN and how this detection leads to the stable expression of Adcy3 protein. Because stabilization of OR choice requires the timely downregulation of LSD1 (Lyons et al., 2013Lyons D.B. Allen W.E. Goh T. Tsai L. Barnea G. Lomvardas S. An epigenetic trap stabilizes singular olfactory receptor expression.Cell. 2013; 154: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), detecting and vetting the OR protein after targeting to the cell membrane may be too slow because GPCR targeting requires an elaborate series of posttranslational modifications and trafficking through the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Thus, protein quality control pathways placed in the first relay station of OR translation and processing, the ER, would rapidly link the onset of OR expression to Adcy3 transcription and, consequently, could provide a kinetic advantage for the stabilization of OR choice. In the ER, a highly conserved protein quality control pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR), acts to homeostatically adjust the ER environment upon detection of unfolded proteins. These adjustments include transcriptional induction of chaperones, acting to increase ER protein folding capacity, and inhibition of translation initiation, aiming to decrease ER load (Ron and Walter, 2007Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). The inhibition of translation initiation occurs downstream of the ER-resident kinase Perk, which in response to detection of unfolded proteins phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eif2α (Ron and Walter, 2007Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). This serves to limit the availability of tRNAmet, resulting in a general inability of ribosomes to initiate translation (Ron and Walter, 2007Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, a small number of mostly stress-responsive mRNAs are preferentially translated under these conditions (Ron and Walter, 2007Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). This can be explained by the presence of inhibitory upstream open reading frames in their 5′ UTRs, which are selectively bypassed when tRNAmet becomes limiting, slowing ribosome assembly (Ron and Walter, 2007Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which is selectively translated under these conditions in many cell types, induces transcriptional changes that contribute to the clearance from the ER of misfolded proteins or to the adaptation of the ER to increased protein load (Harding et al., 2000aHarding H.P.

Perk is essential for translational regulation and cell survival during the unfolded protein response.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). Here, seeking to reveal the mechanistic outline of the OR feedback process, we test the hypothesis that UPR components detect OR proteins in the ER and transmit this information to the nucleus. Our experiments show that OR expression activates Perk in the neuronal ER, which phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eif2α, leading to selective and transient translation of Activating Transcription Factor 5 (ATF5), a paralogue to ATF4 that is highly transcribed in the MOE (Hansen et al., 2002Hansen M.B. Mitchelmore C. Kjaerulff K.M. Rasmussen T.E. Pedersen K.M. Jensen N.A. Mouse Atf5: molecular cloning of two novel mRNAs, genomic organization, and odorant sensory neuron localization.Genomics. 2002; 80: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Translation of the nuclear form of Atf5 induces the transcription of Adcy3, which relieves the UPR, restores global translation, promotes OSN differentiation, and stabilizes the expression of the chosen OR. PERK and ATF5 KO mice, as well as eif2α phosphorylation mutants, exhibit unstable OR expression and OSN maturation deficits, whereas pharmacological induction of the UPR or transgenic expression of nuclear ATF5 can bypass the lack of OR expression or the blockage of this signaling pathway. Our data solve a long-lasting puzzle in OR regulation and provide a use for the UPR in neuronal differentiation and cell fate commitment that is likely applicable to other neurodevelopmental processes. To test the idea that the UPR mediates the OR-elicited feedback signal, we first examined the expression pattern of known components of this pathway in the nose. Our RNaseq analysis performed on sorted cell populations of the MOE (Colquitt et al., 2013Colquitt B.M. Allen W.E. Barnea G. Lomvardas S.

Neurol. 2007; 502: 1138-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, unlike in most cell types, ATF5 expression is more than 100-fold higher than ATF4, making it one of the most highly expressed genes in mature OSNs (mOSNs) and progenitor cells (globose basal cells, GBCs) (Figure 1A, and Hansen et al., 2002Hansen M.B. Mitchelmore C. Kjaerulff K.M. Rasmussen T.E. Pedersen K.M. Jensen N.A. Mouse Atf5: molecular cloning of two novel mRNAs, genomic organization, and odorant sensory neuron localization.Genomics. 2002; 80: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, immunofluorescence (IF) experiments on MOE sections with a highly specific antibody (Figures S1A and S1B available online) reveal Atf5 protein expression only in immature OSNs, just prior to expression Adcy3, the major adenylyl cyclase that is expressed in response to OR expression and defines the mature OSN population (Figure 1B). The mutually exclusive expression pattern of nAtf5 and Adcy3 proteins contradicts the fact that at the mRNA level both genes are highly transcribed in mOSNs (Figure 1A). Because ATF5 mRNA is subject to alternative translation initiation (Watatani et al., 2008Watatani Y. Ichikawa K. Nakanishi N. Fujimoto M. Takeda H. Kimura N. Hirose H. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Stress-induced translation of ATF5 mRNA is regulated by the 5′-untranslated region.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2543-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the cause of the discrepancy between mRNA and protein expression of this gene relies on posttranscriptional regulation relevant to its biological function. Atf5, like its well-characterized paralogue ATF4, has upstream and downstream translation initiation sites that use different frames (Figures S1D–S1G). The upstream ORF encodes for a small peptide, and the downstream ORF encodes for the nuclear transcription factor isoform (Zhou et al., 2008Zhou D. Palam L.R. Jiang L. Narasimhan J. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. Phosphorylation of eIF2 directs ATF5 translational control in response to diverse stress conditions.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7064-7073Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions only the upstream ORF is used, whereas upon ER stress and activation of the UPR, the downstream translation initiation site is preferentially used leading to the production of nuclear Atf5 (nATF5) (Watatani et al., 2008Watatani Y.

Because OR genes are among the most highly transcribed GPCRs, it is conceivable that the onset of their translation induces ER stress and activates the UPR, leading to both ER expansion that accommodates the increased protein load, and translational changes on ATF5. To test this idea, we performed IF for Atf5 in sections from LSD1 KO MOEs (FoxG1-Cre; Lsdfl/fl), in which global OR expression is abolished (Lyons et al., 2013Lyons D.B. Allen W.E. Goh T. Tsai L. Barnea G. Lomvardas S. An epigenetic trap stabilizes singular olfactory receptor expression.Cell. 2013; 154: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These animals exhibit significant reduction of Atf5 immunoreactivity (Figures 1C and 1D), despite the fact that ATF5 mRNA remains highly abundant (Figure S1C). Ectopic and mosaic expression of a transgenic OR, however, which partially rescues the differentiation deficits caused by LSD1 deletion (Lyons et al., 2013Lyons D.B. Allen W.E. Goh T. Tsai L. Barnea G. Lomvardas S. An epigenetic trap stabilizes singular olfactory receptor expression.Cell. 2013; 154: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), restores Atf5 IF signal in the MOE (Figure 1D), suggesting that OR expression is required and sufficient for the translation of nATF5. Importantly, the cellular levels of the transgenic OR are lower than the cellular levels of the endogenous OR protein (data not shown) making unlikely that UPR induction is an overexpression artifact. To test the potential role of ATF5 in the OR-elicited feedback, we obtained from KOMP an ATF5 KO mouse in which nAtf5 expression is abolished (Figures S1A and S1B) and analyzed the effects of ATF5 deletion in OSN maturation and OR choice stabilization. In agreement with previous reports (Wang et al., 2012Wang S.Z. Ou J. Zhu L.J. Green M.R. Transcription factor ATF5 is required for terminal differentiation and survival of olfactory sensory neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 18589-18594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we find a dramatic loss of mOSNs in Atf5 MOEs as assayed by Adcy3 IF at postnatat day 0 (P0) (data not shown). A small number of ATF5 KO mice survive to adulthood, allowing a thorough characterization of the deficits caused by ATF5 deletion. Similarly with the newborn mice, we observe a dramatic loss of Adcy3 immunoreactivity in the ATF5 KO MOEs, with only a few persisting Adcy3-expressing OSNs with an intriguingly patterned spatial organization (Figures 2A and 2B ); it is possible that these OSNs express a different class of chemoreceptors than the typical ORs or that they reflect the inefficient and infrequent rescue of ATF5 activity by ATF4. The widespread loss of Adcy3 expression in the ATF5 KO mice likely accounts for the sustained expression of LSD1 at the apical layers of the MOE (Figures 2C and 2D, and S2A), in agreement with our previous findings (Lyons et al., 2013Lyons D.B.

An epigenetic trap stabilizes singular olfactory receptor expression.Cell. 2013; 154: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, IF experiments with antibodies specific for OR proteins (Barnea et al., 2004Barnea G. O’Donnell S. Mancia F. Sun X. Nemes A. Mendelsohn M. Axel R. Odorant receptors on axon termini in the brain.Science. 2004; 304: 1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, Lomvardas et al., 2006Lomvardas S. Barnea G. Pisapia D.J. Mendelsohn M. Kirkland J. Axel R. Interchromosomal interactions and olfactory receptor choice.Cell. 2006; 126: 403-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) show that in the ATF5 KO MOEs the numbers of OR-expressing neurons are significantly reduced and neurons that do express ORs have much weaker IF signal compared to control littermates (Figures 3E, 3F, S2B, and S2C for quantitation for MOR28 IF signal and numbers of MOR28-expressing cells; similar results obtained for ORs M71 and M50, data not shown). RNA-seq analysis from control and ATF5 KO mice supports these observations showing significant reduction of OR mRNA in the ATF5 KO MOEs (Figure 2G). ATF5 deletion results in an even more dramatic downregulation of mature OSN marker expression (Figures 2H and S2C). Given that we already established that nAtf5 is produced only in response to OR expression, if this is the isoform involved in this process, then OR downregulation reflects OR choice stabilization defects and not deficiencies in initiation of OR expression, similar to the ones observed in the Adcy3 KO mice (Lyons et al., 2013Lyons D.B.

An epigenetic trap stabilizes singular olfactory receptor expression.Cell. 2013; 154: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the sustained LSD1 expression in the ATF5 KO mice, which results in frequent OR gene switching.Figure S2Characterization of OR Feedback Deficit in Atf5 Mutants, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Quantification of Lsd1 IF intensity in a section from P40 Atf5+/− and Atf5−/− littermates (see methods).

Here, we identify a polymorphic p53 responsive element and demonstrate its influence on cancer risk using genome-wide data sets of cancer susceptibility loci, genetic variation, p53 occupancy, and p53-binding sites. We uncover a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a functional p53-binding site and establish its influence on the ability of p53 to bind to and regulate transcription of the KITLG gene. The SNP resides in KITLG and associates with one of the largest risks identified among cancer genome-wide association studies. We establish that the SNP has undergone positive selection throughout evolution, signifying a selective benefit, but go on to show that similar SNPs are rare in the genome due to negative selection, indicating that polymorphisms in p53-binding sites are primarily detrimental to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2159279413,"Cellular senescence is an irreversible state of proliferation arrest evoked by a myriad of stresses including oncogene activation, telomere shortening/dysfunction and genotoxic insults. It has been associated with tumor activation, immune suppression and aging, owing to the secretion of proinflammatory mediators. The bacterial genotoxin colibactin, encoded by the pks genomic island is frequently harboured by Escherichia coli strains of the B2 phylogenetic group. Mammalian cells exposed to live pks+ bacteria exhibit DNA-double strand breaks (DSB) and undergo cell-cycle arrest and death. Here we show that cells that survive the acute bacterial infection with pks+ E. coli display hallmarks of cellular senescence: chronic DSB, prolonged cell-cycle arrest, enhanced senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity, expansion of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear foci and senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. This was accompanied by reactive oxygen species production and pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases secretion. These mediators were able to trigger DSB and enhanced SA-β-Gal activity in bystander recipient cells treated with conditioned medium from senescent cells. Furthermore, these senescent cells promoted the growth of human tumor cells. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that the E. coli genotoxin colibactin induces cellular senescence and subsequently propel bystander genotoxic and oncogenic effects."

In this study, we combined reverse vaccinology and proteomics to identify surface-exposed and secreted antigens from A. baumannii. Using in silico prediction tools and comparative genome analysis in combination with in vitro proteomic approaches, we identified 42 antigens that could be used as potential vaccine targets. Considering the paucity of effective antibiotics available to treat multidrug-resistant A. baumannii infections, these vaccine targets may serve as a framework for the development of a broadly protective multi-component vaccine, an outcome that would have a major impact on the burden of A. baumannii infections in intensive care units across the globe."
https://openalex.org/W2050660850,"For almost 30 years, keratinocyte differentiation has been studied in numerous cell models including keratinocyte primary culture with various supplemented culture media. In this respect, it has become quite difficult to draw comparisons between studies using such a variety of culture conditions. Serum-free condition with low calcium has been used to culture basal proliferating cells, though differentiation is induced by various procedures. These latter include the addition of calcium at mM concentration and a concomitant addition of serum and calcium. Lowering the incubation temperature of cells has also been reported to induce a premature differentiation of keratinocytes in organotypic skin culture. This effect of temperature on keratinocyte differentiation has been poorly depicted, although average human skin temperature has been shown to be about 32°C. However, studying differentiation and quantifying shifts in the differentiation rate of a cell population implies to precisely know i) the proportion of differentiated cells in the whole population, and ii) to which extent and to which level of expression, the induction of a gene or a protein might be considered as a marker of differentiation. This lack has rarely been taken into consideration and has surely led to over-interpretations of single protein induction and to consequent extrapolations to real differentiation processes. By means of paralleled analyses with immunocytofluorescence, flow cytometry, and with multiple differentiation markers quantify by qPCR and western-blot, we studied the paradoxical connection between calcium, serum, multilayer culture and incubation temperature on the differentiation of in vitro keratinocytes. Conversely to previous reports, we have shown that calcium switch is indeed a potent model for inducing calcium-dependent genes, but is not an efficient procedure when one wishes to assess the keratinocyte differentiation rate. Moreover, we have demonstrated that a synergic stimulation by calcium, serum, confluence and lower incubation temperature amplified the differentiation rate."
https://openalex.org/W2045212827,"Background Various inflammatory biomarkers show prognostic potential for multiple sclerosis (MS)-risk after clinically isolated syndromes. However, biomarkers are often examined singly and their interrelation and precise aspects of their associated pathological processes remain unclear. Clarification of these relationships could aid the appropriate implementation of prognostic biomarkers in clinical practice. Objective To investigate the interrelation between biomarkers of inflammation, demyelination and neurodegeneration in acute optic neuritis and to assess their association to measures of MS risk. Material and Methods A prospective study at a tertiary referral centre from June 2011 to December 2012 of 56 patients with optic neuritis as a first demyelinating symptom and 27 healthy volunteers. Lumbar puncture was performed within 28 (median 16) days of onset. CSF levels of CXCL13, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, CXCL10, CCL-2, osteopontin and chitinase-3-like-1, myelin basic protein (MBP) and neurofilament light-chain (NF-L) were determined. MS-risk outcome measures were dissemination in space (DIS) of white matter lesions on cerebral MRI, CSF oligoclonal bands and elevated IgG-index. Results In the interrelation analysis the biomarkers showed close correlations within two distinct groups: Biomarkers of leukocyte infiltration (CXCL13, MMP-9 and CXCL10) were strongly associated (p<0.0001 for all). Osteopontin and chitinase-3-like-1 were also tightly associated (p<0.0001) and correlated strongly to tissue damage markers (NF-L and MBP). The biomarkers of leukocyte infiltration all associated strongly with MS-risk parameters, whereas CHI3L1 and MBP correlated with MRI DIS, but not with CSF MS-risk parameters and osteopontin and NF-L did not correlate with any MS-risk parameters. Conclusions Our findings suggest two distinct inflammatory processes: one of leukocyte infiltration, represented by CXCL13, CXCL10 and MMP-9, strongly associated with and potentially predicting MS-risk; the other represented by osteopontin and CHI3L1, suggesting tissue damage-related inflammation, potentially predicting residual disabilities after attack and perhaps cumulative damage over time. These hypotheses should be further addressed in follow-up studies."
https://openalex.org/W1978310300,"High fat diets and accompanying hepatic steatosis are highly prevalent conditions. Previous work has shown that steatosis is accompanied by enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may mediate further liver damage. Here we investigated mechanisms leading to enhanced ROS generation following high fat diets (HFD). We found that mitochondria from HFD livers present no differences in maximal respiratory rates and coupling, but generate more ROS specifically when fatty acids are used as substrates. Indeed, many acyl-CoA dehydrogenase isoforms were found to be more highly expressed in HFD livers, although only the very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) was more functionally active. Studies conducted with permeabilized mitochondria and different chain length acyl-CoA derivatives suggest that VLCAD is also a source of ROS production in mitochondria of HFD animals. This production is stimulated by the lack of NAD(+). Overall, our studies uncover VLCAD as a novel, diet-sensitive, source of mitochondrial ROS."
https://openalex.org/W2001217529,"Aspergillus fumigatus is the causative agent of invasive aspergillosis, leading to infection-related mortality in immunocompromised patients. We previously showed that the conserved and unique-to-fungi veA gene affects different cell processes such as morphological development, gliotoxin biosynthesis and protease activity, suggesting a global regulatory effect on the genome of this medically relevant fungus. In this study, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that veA controls the expression of hundreds of genes in A. fumigatus, including those comprising more than a dozen known secondary metabolite gene clusters. Chemical analysis confirmed that veA controls the synthesis of other secondary metabolites in this organism in addition to gliotoxin. Among the secondary metabolite gene clusters regulated by veA is the elusive but recently identified gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of fumagillin, a meroterpenoid known for its anti-angiogenic activity by binding to human methionine aminopeptidase 2. The fumagillin gene cluster contains a veA-dependent regulatory gene, fumR (Afu8g00420), encoding a putative C6 type transcription factor. Deletion of fumR results in silencing of the gene cluster and elimination of fumagillin biosynthesis. We found expression of fumR to also be dependent on laeA, a gene encoding another component of the fungal velvet complex. The results in this study argue that veA is a global regulator of secondary metabolism in A. fumigatus, and that veA may be a conduit via which chemical development is coupled to morphological development and other cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W2041907803,"Cardiac function depends on the ability to switch between fatty acid and glucose oxidation for energy production in response to changes in substrate availability and energetic stress. In obese and diabetic individuals, increased reliance on fatty acids and reduced metabolic flexibility are thought to contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease. Mechanisms by which cardiac mitochondria contribute to diet-induced metabolic inflexibility were investigated. Mice were fed a high fat or low fat diet for 1 d, 1 wk, and 20 wk. Cardiac mitochondria isolated from mice fed a high fat diet displayed a diminished ability to utilize the glycolytically derived substrate pyruvate. This response was rapid, occurring within the first day on the diet, and persisted for up to 20 wk. A selective increase in the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 and inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase are responsible for the rapid suppression of pyruvate utilization. An important consequence is that pyruvate dehydrogenase is sensitized to inhibition when mitochondria respire in the presence of fatty acids. Additionally, increased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 preceded any observed diet-induced reductions in the levels of glucose transporter type 4 and glycolytic enzymes and, as judged by Akt phosphorylation, insulin signaling. Importantly, diminished insulin signaling evident at 1 wk on the high fat diet did not occur in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 knockout mice. Dietary intervention leads to a rapid decline in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 levels and recovery of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity indicating an additional form of regulation. Finally, an overnight fast elicits a metabolic response similar to that induced by high dietary fat obscuring diet-induced metabolic changes. Thus, our data indicate that diet-induced inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase may be an initiating event in decreased oxidation of glucose and increased reliance of the heart on fatty acids for energy production."
https://openalex.org/W2060492400,"Background A significant increase in mortality was observed during cold winters in many temperate regions. However, there is a lack of evidence from tropical and subtropical regions, and the influence of ambient temperatures on seasonal variation of mortality was not well documented. Methods This study included 213,737 registered deaths from January 2003 to December 2011 in Guangzhou, a subtropical city in Southern China. Excess winter mortality was calculated by the excess percentage of monthly mortality in winters over that of non-winter months. A generalized linear model with a quasi-Poisson distribution was applied to analyze the association between monthly mean temperature and mortality, after controlling for other meteorological measures and air pollution. Results The mortality rate in the winter was 26% higher than the average rate in other seasons. On average, there were 1,848 excess winter deaths annually, with around half (52%) from cardiovascular diseases and a quarter (24%) from respiratory diseases. Excess winter mortality was higher in the elderly, females and those with low education level than the young, males and those with high education level, respectively. A much larger winter increase was observed in out-of-hospital mortality compared to in-hospital mortality (45% vs. 17%). We found a significant negative correlation of annual excess winter mortality with average winter temperature (rs=-0.738, P=0.037), but not with air pollution levels. A 1 °C decrease in monthly mean temperature was associated with an increase of 1.38% (95%CI:0.34%-2.40%) and 0.88% (95%CI:0.11%-1.64%) in monthly mortality at lags of 0-1 month, respectively. Conclusion Similar to temperate regions, a subtropical city Guangzhou showed a clear seasonal pattern in mortality, with a sharper spike in winter. Our results highlight the role of cold temperature on the winter mortality even in warm climate. Precautionary measures should be strengthened to mitigate cold-related mortality for people living in warm climate."

VopL consists of a VopL C-terminal domain (VCD) and an array of three WASP homology 2 (WH2) motifs. Here, we report the crystal structure of the VCD dimer bound to actin. The VCD organizes three actin monomers in a spatial arrangement close to that found in the canonical actin filament. In this arrangement, WH2 motifs can be modeled into the binding site of each actin without steric clashes. The data suggest a mechanism of nucleation wherein VopL creates filament-like structures, organized by the VCD with monomers delivered by the WH2 array, that can template addition of new subunits. Similarities with Arp2/3 complex and formin proteins suggest that organization of monomers into filament-like structures is a general and central feature of actin nucleation."
https://openalex.org/W1995739614,"Fishes of the order Characiformes are a diverse and economically important teleost clade whose extant members are found exclusively in African and Neotropical freshwaters. Although their transatlantic distribution has been primarily attributed to the Early Cretaceous fragmentation of western Gondwana, vicariance has not been tested with temporal information beyond that contained in their fragmentary fossil record and a recent time-scaled phylogeny focused on the African family Alestidae. Because members of the suborder Citharinoidei constitute the sister lineage to the entire remaining Afro-Neotropical characiform radiation, we inferred a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of citharinoids using a popular Bayesian approach to molecular dating in order to assess the adequacy of current vicariance hypotheses and shed light on the early biogeographic history of characiform fishes. Given that the only comprehensive phylogenetic treatment of the Citharinoidei has been a morphology-based analysis published over three decades ago, the present study also provided an opportunity to further investigate citharinoid relationships and update the evolutionary framework that has laid the foundations for the current classification of the group. The inferred chronogram is robust to changes in calibration priors and suggests that the origins of citharinoids date back to the Turonian (ca 90 Ma) of the Late Cretaceous. Most modern citharinoid genera, however, appear to have originated and diversified much more recently, mainly during the Miocene. By reconciling molecular-clock- with fossil-based estimates for the origins of the Characiformes, our results provide further support for the hypothesis that attributes the disjunct distribution of the order to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. The striking overlap in tempo of diversification and biogeographic patterns between citharinoids and the African-endemic family Alestidae suggests that their evolutionary histories could have been strongly and similarly influenced by Miocene geotectonic events that modified the landscape and produced the drainage pattern of Central Africa seen today."

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of immobilizing anti-CD34 antibodies onto a POSS-PCU nanocomposite polymer surface to sequester endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from human blood, and to characterize the surface properties and hemocompatibility of this surface. Amine-functionalized fumed silica was used to covalently conjugate anti-CD34 to the polymer surface. Water contact angle, fluorescence microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy were used for surface characterization. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were seeded on modified and pristine POSS-PCU polymer films. After 7 days, adhered cells were immunostained for the expression of EPC and endothelial cell markers, and assessed for the formation of EPC colonies. Hemocompatibility was assessed by thromboelastography, and platelet activation and adhesion assays. The number of EPC colonies formed on anti-CD34-coated POSS-PCU surfaces was not significantly higher than that of POSS-PCU (5.0±1.0 vs. 1.7±0.6, p>0.05). However, antibody conjugation significantly improved hemocompatibility, as seen from the prolonged reaction and clotting times, decreased angle and maximum amplitude (p<0.05), as well as decreased platelet adhesion (76.8±7.8 vs. 8.4±0.7, p<0.05) and activation. Here, we demonstrate that POSS-PCU surface immobilized anti-CD34 antibodies selectively captured CD34+ cells from peripheral blood, although only a minority of these were EPCs. Nevertheless, antibody conjugation significantly improves the hemocompatibility of POSS-PCU, and should therefore continue to be explored in combination with other strategies to improve the specificity of EPC capture to promote in situ endothelialization."

Fibronectin also binds to collagen type I and mediates the co-assembly of collagen fibrils into the extracellular matrix. Here, the role of collagen-fibronectin binding in fibronectin-induced cellular self-assembly was investigated using fibronectin-null fibroblasts in an in vitro model of tissue formation. High resolution, two-photon immunofluorescence microscopy was combined with second harmonic generation imaging to examine spatial and temporal relationships among fibronectin and collagen fibrils, actin organization, cell proliferation, and microtissue morphology. Time course studies coupled with simultaneous 4-channel multiphoton imaging identified regional differences in fibronectin fibril conformation, collagen fibril remodeling, actin organization, and cell proliferation during three-dimensional cellular self-assembly. Regional differences in cell proliferation and fibronectin structure were dependent on both soluble fibronectin concentration and fibronectin-collagen interactions. Fibronectin-collagen binding was not necessary for either fibronectin matrix formation or intercellular cohesion. However, inhibiting fibronectin binding to collagen reduced collagen fibril remodeling, decreased fibronectin fibril extension, blocked fibronectin-induced cell proliferation, and altered microtissue morphology. Furthermore, continual fibronectin-collagen binding was necessary to maintain both cell proliferation and microtissue morphology. Collectively, these data suggest that the complex changes in extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal remodeling that mediate tissue assembly are driven, in part, by regional variations in cell-mediated fibronectin-collagen co-assembly."

Expression of several xyloglucan-related genes in actively growing pollen tubes was confirmed and xyloglucan epitopes were detected in the wall with carbohydrate-specific antibodies: the major xyloglucan oligosaccharides found in N. alata pollen grains and tubes were fucosylated, an unusual structure for the Solanaceae, the family to which Nicotiana belongs. Finally, carbohydrate linkages consistent with xyloglucan were identified chemically in the walls of N. alata pollen grains and pollen tubes grown in culture. The presence of a fucosylated xyloglucan in Nicotiana pollen tube walls was thus confirmed. The consequences of this discovery to models of pollen tube growth dynamics and more generally to polarised tip-growing cells in plants are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2161350565,"Background Decisions under risk and with outcomes that are delayed in time are ubiquitous in real life and can have a significant impact on the health and wealth of the decision-maker. Despite its potential relevance for real-world choices, the degree of aberrant risky and intertemporal decision-making in patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has received little attention to date. Method We used a case-control design to compare decision-making in healthy control subjects (N=16) versus untreated depressed subjects in a current major depressive episode (N=20). In order to examine how major depressive disorder (MDD) may impact decision-making, subjects made decisions over (1) risky outcomes and (2) delayed outcomes in the domain of gains and losses using choice paradigms from neuroeconomics. In a pre-planned analysis, depressed subjects were subdivided into those with primary PTSD along with comorbid MDD (MDD+PTSD) versus those with primary MDD without PTSD (MDD-only). Choice behavior was modeled via a standard econometric model of intertemporal choice, a quasi-hyperbolic temporal discounting function, which was estimated for each subject group separately. Results Under conditions of potential gain, depressed subjects demonstrated greater discounting for gains across all time frames compared to controls. In the realm of losses, both subgroups of depressed subjects discounted more steeply than controls for short time frames. However, for delayed losses ranging from >1-10 years, MDD+PTSD subjects showed shallower discounting rates relative to MDD-only subjects, who continued to discount future losses steeply. Risk attitudes did not contribute to differences in intertemporal choice. Conclusions Depressed patients make choices that minimize current pain and maximize current reward, despite severe later consequences or lost opportunities. Anxiety associated with PTSD may serve as a partially protective factor in decision-making about long-term potential losses compared to MDD patients without PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W2020044651,"Lymphocyte trafficking and migration through vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in secondary lymphoid tissues is critical for immune protection. In the present study, we investigate the role of nectin cell adhesion molecules for the migration of lymphocytes through ECs. Nectins are key players for the establishment of homotypic and heterotypic cell to cell contacts; they are required for cell to cell adherens junction formation and take part in the transendothelial migration of monocytes during the step of diapedesis, when monocytes migrate through EC junctions. We first show that Nectin-3 (CD113) is the only nectin expressed by T lymphocytes and since nectins are expressed on ECs we explored Nectin-3 potential functions in lymphocyte: EC interactions. We demonstrate that Nectin-2, expressed on ECs, is the major counter-receptor of Nectin-3. A soluble form of Nectin-3 binds to Nectin-2 localized at EC junctions and blocking Nectin-2 trans-interactions with monoclonal antibodies abolishes the binding of soluble Nectin-3 to ECs. Nectin-2 is expressed on High Endothelial venules (HEVs), where lymphocyte homing occurs in vivo. Finally, we show that Nectin-3 trans-interaction with Nectin-2 is essential for the process of lymphocyte transendothelial migration in vitro as targeting with blocking monoclonal antibodies either Nectin-3, expressed on lymphocytes, or Nectin-2, expressed on ECs, inhibits lymphocyte extravasation. The nectin family of CAMs is important for the regulation of endothelial barrier functions and transendothelial migration of immune cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that Nectin-3 trans-interacts with Nectin-2 to promote lymphocyte and monocyte extravasation."
https://openalex.org/W2027388907,"It was repeatedly demonstrated that a negative emotional context enhances memory for central details while impairing memory for peripheral information. This trade-off effect is assumed to result from attentional processes: a negative context seems to narrow attention to central information at the expense of more peripheral details, thus causing the differential effects in memory. However, this explanation has rarely been tested and previous findings were partly inconclusive. For the present experiment 13 negative and 13 neutral naturalistic, thematically driven picture stories were constructed to test the trade-off effect in an ecologically more valid setting as compared to previous studies. During an incidental encoding phase, eye movements were recorded as an index of overt attention. In a subsequent recognition phase, memory for central and peripheral details occurring in the picture stories was tested. Explicit affective ratings and autonomic responses validated the induction of emotion during encoding. Consistent with the emotional trade-off effect on memory, encoding context differentially affected recognition of central and peripheral details. However, contrary to the common assumption, the emotional trade-off effect on memory was not mediated by attentional processes. By contrast, results suggest that the relevance of attentional processing for later recognition memory depends on the centrality of information and the emotional context but not their interaction. Thus, central information was remembered well even when fixated very briefly whereas memory for peripheral information depended more on overt attention at encoding. Moreover, the influence of overt attention on memory for central and peripheral details seems to be much lower for an arousing as compared to a neutral context."
https://openalex.org/W2103449846,"The Vpr protein from type 1 and type 2 Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) is thought to inactivate several host proteins through the hijacking of the DCAF1 adaptor of the Cul4A ubiquitin ligase. Here, we identified two transcriptional regulators, ZIP and sZIP, as Vpr-binding proteins degraded in the presence of Vpr. ZIP and sZIP have been shown to act through the recruitment of the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex. Strikingly, chromatin is the only cellular fraction where Vpr is present together with Cul4A ubiquitin ligase subunits. Components of the NuRD complex and exogenous ZIP and sZIP were also associated with this fraction. Several lines of evidence indicate that Vpr induces ZIP and sZIP degradation by hijacking DCAF1: (i) Vpr induced a drastic decrease of exogenously expressed ZIP and sZIP in a dose-dependent manner, (ii) this decrease relied on the proteasome activity, (iii) ZIP or sZIP degradation was impaired in the presence of a DCAF1-binding deficient Vpr mutant or when DCAF1 expression was silenced. Vpr-mediated ZIP and sZIP degradation did not correlate with the growth-related Vpr activities, namely G2 arrest and G2 arrest-independent cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, infection with HIV-1 viruses expressing Vpr led to the degradation of the two proteins. Altogether our results highlight the existence of two host transcription factors inactivated by Vpr. The role of Vpr-mediated ZIP and sZIP degradation in the HIV-1 replication cycle remains to be deciphered."
https://openalex.org/W2047990479,"Chafuroside B was recently isolated as a new polyphenolic constituent of oolong tea leaves. However, the effects of chafuroside B on skin function have not been examined. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of chafuroside B against UVB-induced DNA damage, apoptosis and generation of photo-immunosuppression related mediators in cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). Chafuroside B at 1 µM attenuated both UVB-induced apoptosis, evaluated in terms of caspase-3/7 activity, and UVB-induced DNA damage, evaluated in terms of formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), in NHEK exposed to UVB (20 mJ/cm2). In addition, chafuroside B at 0.3 or 1 µM suppressed the UVB-induced production of interleukin (IL)-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), as determined by ELISA, and conversely enhanced IL-12 mRNA expression and production, as measured by RT-PCR and ELISA. Further, chafuroside B at 1 µM also suppressed UVB-induced expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) mRNA. These results indicate that chafuroside B promotes repair of UVB-induced DNA damage and ameliorates the generation of IL-10, TNF-α, PGE2, and RANKL, all of which are UVB-induced immunosuppression related mediators. These effects of chafuroside B may be mediated at least in part through induction of IL-12 synthesis in human keratinocytes. Because chafuroside B might have practical value as a photoprotective agent, a further study of the in vivo effects of chafuroside B seems warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2077770989,"A Colombian field isolate (SfCOL-wt) of Spodoptera frugiperda multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SfMNPV) is a mixture of different genotypes. To evaluate the insecticidal properties of the different genotypic variants, 83 plaque purified virus were characterized. Ten distinct genotypes were identified (named A through J). SfCOL-A was the most prevalent (71±2%; mean ± SE) showing a PstI restriction profile indistinguishable to that of SfCOL-wt. The remaining nine genotypes presented genomic deletions of 3.8 - 21.8 Kb located mainly between nucleotides 11,436 and 33,883 in the reference genome SfMNPV-B, affecting the region between open reading frames (ORFs) sf20 and sf33. The insecticidal activity of each genotype from SfCOL-wt and several mixtures of genotypes was compared to that of SfCOL-wt. The potency of SfCOL-A occlusion bodies (OBs) was 4.4-fold higher than SfCOL-wt OBs, whereas the speed of kill of SfCOL-A was similar to that of SfCOL-wt. Deletion genotype OBs were similarly or less potent than SfCOL-wt but six deletion genotypes were faster killing than SfCOL-wt. The potency of genotype mixtures co-occluded within OBs were consistently reduced in two-genotype mixtures involving equal proportions of SfCOL-A and one of three deletion genotypes (SfCOL-C, -D or -F). Speed of kill and OB production were improved only when the certain genotype mixtures were co-occluded, although OB production was higher in the SfCOL-wt isolate than in any of the component genotypes, or mixtures thereof. Deleted genotypes reduced OB potency but increased OB production of the SfCOL-wt population, which is structured to maximize the production of OBs in each infected host."
https://openalex.org/W2124629457,"Host plant choice is of vital importance for egg laying herbivorous insects that do not exhibit brood care. Several aspects, including palatability, nutritional quality and predation risk, have been found to modulate host preference. Olfactory cues are thought to enable host location. However, experimental data on odor features that allow choosing among alternative hosts while still in flight are not available. It has previously been shown that M. sexta females prefer Datura wrightii compared to Nicotiana attenuata. The bouquet of the latter is more intense and contains compounds typically emitted by plants after feeding-damage to attract the herbivore's enemies. In this wind tunnel study, we offered female gravid hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) odors from these two ecologically relevant, attractive, non-flowering host species. M. sexta females preferred surrogate leaves scented with vegetative odors form both host species to unscented control leaves. Given a choice between species, females preferred the odor bouquet emitted by D. wrightii to that of N. attenuata. Harmonizing, i.e. adjusting, volatile intensity to similar levels did not abolish but significantly weakened this preference. Superimposing, i.e. mixing, the highly attractive headspaces of both species, however, abolished discrimination between scented and non-scented surrogate leaves. Beyond ascertaining the role of blend composition in host plant choice, our results raise the following hypotheses. (i) The odor of a host species is perceived as a discrete odor 'Gestalt', and its core properties are lost upon mixing two attractive scents (ii). Stimulus intensity is a secondary feature affecting olfactory-based host choice (iii). Constitutively smelling like a plant that is attracting herbivore enemies may be part of a plant's strategy to avoid herbivory where alternative hosts are available to the herbivore."
https://openalex.org/W2065833746,"The aim of this study was to correlate specific fatty acid profiles of visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) with inflammatory signatures potentially associated with colorectal cancer (CRC).Human adipocytes were isolated from biopsies of visceral WAT from 24 subjects subdivided in four groups: normal-weight (BMI 22.0-24.9 Kg/m2) and over-weight/obese (BMI 26.0-40.0 Kg/m2), affected or not by CRC. To define whether obesity and/or CRC affect the inflammatory status of WAT, the activation of the pro-inflammatory STAT3 and the anti-inflammatory PPARγ transcription factors as well as the expression of adiponectin were analyzed by immunoblotting in adipocytes isolated from each group of subjects. Furthermore, to evaluate whether differences in inflammatory WAT environment correlate with specific fatty acid profiles, gas-chromatographic analysis was carried out on WAT collected from all subject categories. Finally, the effect of the ω3 docosahexaenoic acid treatment on the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in adipocytes was also evaluated.We provide the first evidence for the existence of a pro-inflammatory environment in WAT of CRC patients, as assessed by the up-regulation of STAT3, and the concomitant decrease of PPARγ and adiponectin with respect to healthy subjects. WAT inflammatory status was independent of obesity degree but correlated with a decreased ω3-/ω6-polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio. These observations suggested that qualitative changes, other than quantitative ones, in WAT fatty acid may influence tissue dysfunctions potentially linked to inflammatory conditions. This hypothesis was further supported by the finding that adipocyte treatment with docosahexaenoic acid restored the equilibrium between STAT3 and PPARγ.Our results suggest that adipocyte dysfunctions occur in CRC patients creating a pro-inflammatory environment that might influence cancer development. Furthermore, the protective potential of docosahexaenoic acid in re-establishing the equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors might represent a useful tool for preventive and therapeutic strategies."

In the present study, we tested the proficiency in face detection and face categorization with a large sample of participants (N = 312; age range: 2-88 yrs). As test objects, we used so-called Mooney faces, two-tone (black and white) images of faces lacking critical information of a local, featural and relational nature, reflecting difficult real world face processing conditions. We found that performance in the assessment of gender and age from Mooney faces increases up to about age 15, and decreases from 65 years on. The implications of these findings are discussed in the light of classic and recent findings from face development literature."
https://openalex.org/W1976920478,"Although nickel exposure results in allergic reactions, respiratory conditions, and cancer in humans and rodents, the ramifications of excess nickel in the environment for animal and human health remain largely undescribed. Nickel and other cationic metals travel through waterways and bind to soils and sediments. To evaluate the potential toxic effects of nickel at environmental contaminant levels (8.9-7,600 µg Ni/g dry weight of sediment and 50-800 µg NiCl2/L of water), we conducted assays using two cosmopolitan nematodes, Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus. We assayed the effects of both sediment-bound and aqueous nickel upon animal growth, developmental survival, lifespan, and fecundity. Uncontaminated sediments were collected from sites in the Midwestern United States and spiked with a range of nickel concentrations. We found that nickel-spiked sediment substantially impairs both survival from larval to adult stages and adult longevity in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, while aqueous nickel showed no adverse effects on either survivorship or longevity, we observed a significant decrease in fecundity, indicating that aqueous nickel could have a negative impact on nematode physiology. Intriguingly, C. elegans and P. pacificus exhibit similar, but not identical, responses to nickel exposure. Moreover, P. pacificus could be tested successfully in sediments inhospitable to C. elegans. Our results add to a growing body of literature documenting the impact of nickel on animal physiology, and suggest that environmental toxicological studies could gain an advantage by widening their repertoire of nematode species."
https://openalex.org/W2125975478,"Although efficient delivery and distribution of treatment agents over the whole tumor is essential for successful tumor treatment, the distribution of most of these agents cannot be visualized. However, with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), both delivery and uptake of radiolabeled peptides can be visualized in a neuroendocrine tumor model overexpressing somatostatin receptors. A heterogeneous peptide uptake is often observed in these tumors. We hypothesized that peptide distribution in the tumor is spatially related to tumor perfusion, vessel density and permeability, as imaged and quantified by DCE-MRI in a neuroendocrine tumor model. Four subcutaneous CA20948 tumor-bearing Lewis rats were injected with the somatostatin-analog (111)In-DTPA-Octreotide (50 MBq). SPECT-CT and MRI scans were acquired and MRI was spatially registered to SPECT-CT. DCE-MRI was analyzed using semi-quantitative and quantitative methods. Correlation between SPECT and DCE-MRI was investigated with 1) Spearman's rank correlation coefficient; 2) SPECT uptake values grouped into deciles with corresponding median DCE-MRI parametric values and vice versa; and 3) linear regression analysis for median parameter values in combined datasets. In all tumors, areas with low peptide uptake correlated with low perfusion/density/ /permeability for all DCE-MRI-derived parameters. Combining all datasets, highest linear regression was found between peptide uptake and semi-quantitative parameters (R(2)>0.7). The average correlation coefficient between SPECT and DCE-MRI-derived parameters ranged from 0.52-0.56 (p<0.05) for parameters primarily associated with exchange between blood and extracellular extravascular space. For these parameters a linear relation with peptide uptake was observed. In conclusion, the 'exchange-related' DCE-MRI-derived parameters seemed to predict peptide uptake better than the 'contrast amount- related' parameters. Consequently, fast and efficient diffusion through the vessel wall into tissue is an important factor for peptide delivery. DCE-MRI helps to elucidate the relation between vascular characteristics, peptide delivery and treatment efficacy, and may form a basis to predict targeting efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1972332901,"The number of valid species in the genus Echinometra (Echinodermata, Echinoidea) and their associated identification keys have been debated in the scientific literature for more than 180 years. As the phylogeny and dispersal patterns of these species have been widely used as a prominent model for marine speciation, new insights into their taxonomy have the potential to deepen our understanding of marine speciation processes. In this study we examine Echinometra taxonomy, combining morphology and molecular tools. We present the taxonomy and phylogeny of Red Sea and Western Indian Ocean Echinometra. The currently available morphological keys were found to be limited in their ability to delineate all species within this genus. Nonetheless, morphological similarities between the Red Sea and Western Indian Ocean populations were high, and delimited them from the other species. These latter populations together formed a monophyletic clade, genetically distant from any of the other Echinometra species by more than 3%. Combining both traditional taxonomy and molecular evidence, we found that these populations were neither Echinometra mathaei nor E. oblonga, as previously considered. The morphological discrepancies of these populations, and their genetic divergence from the other Echinometra species, suggest that they should be considered as a new Echinometra species."
https://openalex.org/W2071137097,"The Mongolian steppe is one of the most important grasslands in the world but suffers from aridization and damage from anthropogenic activities. Understanding structure and function of this community is important for the ecological conservation, but has seldom been investigated.In this study, a total of 324 quadrats located on the three main types of Mongolian steppes were surveyed. Early-season perennial forbs (37% of total importance value), late-season annual forbs (33%) and late-season perennial forbs (44%) were dominant in meadow, typical and desert steppes, respectively. Species richness, diversity and plant functional type (PFT) richness decreased from the meadow, via typical to desert steppes, but evenness increased; PFT diversity in the desert and meadow steppes was higher than that in typical steppe. However, above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) was far lower in desert steppe than in the other two steppes. In addition, the slope of the relationship between species richness and PFT richness increased from the meadow, via typical to desert steppes. Similarly, with an increase in species diversity, PFT diversity increased more quickly in both the desert and typical steppes than that in meadow steppe. Random resampling suggested that this coordination was partly due to a sampling effect of diversity.These results indicate that desert steppe should be strictly protected because of its limited functional redundancy, which its ecological functioning is sensitive to species loss. In contrast, despite high potential forage production shared by the meadow and typical steppes, management of these two types of steppes should be different: meadow steppe should be preserved due to its higher conservation value characterized by more species redundancy and higher spatial heterogeneity, while typical steppe could be utilized moderately because its dominant grass genus Stipa is resistant to herbivory and drought."
https://openalex.org/W2076754563,"Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an international health concern that has a devastating effect on patients and families. While several genetic risk factors for AD have been identified much of the genetic variance in AD remains unexplained. There are limited published assessments of the familiality of Alzheimer’s disease. Here we present the largest genealogy-based analysis of AD to date. Methods We assessed the familiality of AD in The Utah Population Database (UPDB), a population-based resource linking electronic health data repositories for the state with the computerized genealogy of the Utah settlers and their descendants. We searched UPDB for significant familial clustering of AD to evaluate the genetic contribution to disease. We compared the Genealogical Index of Familiality (GIF) between AD individuals and randomly selected controls and estimated the Relative Risk (RR) for a range of family relationships. Finally, we identified pedigrees with a significant excess of AD deaths. Results The GIF analysis showed that pairs of individuals dying from AD were significantly more related than expected. This excess of relatedness was observed for both close and distant relationships. RRs for death from AD among relatives of individuals dying from AD were significantly increased for both close and more distant relatives. Multiple pedigrees had a significant excess of AD deaths. Conclusions These data strongly support a genetic contribution to the observed clustering of individuals dying from AD. This report is the first large population-based assessment of the familiality of AD mortality and provides the only reported estimates of relative risk of AD mortality in extended relatives to date. The high-risk pedigrees identified show a true excess of AD mortality (not just multiple cases) and are greater in depth and width than published AD pedigrees. The presence of these high-risk pedigrees strongly supports the possibility of rare predisposition variants not yet identified."
https://openalex.org/W2003985502,"Myosin II (MyoII) is required for insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)-mediated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our previous studies have shown that insulin signaling stimulates phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (RLC) of MyoIIA via myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). The experiments described here delineate upstream regulators of MLCK during insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Since 3T3-L1 adipocytes express two MyoII isoforms, we wanted to determine which isoform was required for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Using a siRNA approach, we demonstrate that a 60% decrease in MyoIIA protein expression resulted in a 40% inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. We also show that insulin signaling stimulates the phosphorylation of MLCK. We further show that MLCK can be activated by calcium as well as signaling pathways. We demonstrate that adipocytes treated with the calcium chelating agent, 1,2-b (iso-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra acetic acid, (BAPTA) (in the presence of insulin) impaired the insulin-induced phosphorylation of MLCK by 52% and the RLC of MyoIIA by 45% as well as impairing the recruitment of MyoIIA to the plasma membrane when compared to cells treated with insulin alone. We further show that the calcium ionophore, A23187 alone stimulated the phosphorylation of MLCK and the RLC associated with MyoIIA to the same extent as insulin. To identify signaling pathways that might regulate MLCK, we examined ERK and CaMKII. Inhibition of ERK2 impaired phosphorylation of MLCK and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In contrast, while inhibition of CaMKII did inhibit phosphorylation of the RLC associated with MyoIIA, inhibition of CAMKIIδ did not impair MLCK phosphorylation or translocation to the plasma membrane or glucose uptake. Collectively, our results are the first to delineate a role for calcium and ERK in the activation of MLCK and thus MyoIIA during insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes."

However, after adjustment for maternal age, parental education and birth order the shape of the association changed. Offspring of fathers younger than 20 still showed slightly lower cognitive ability (-1.11 (95% CI -1.68 to -0.54)), but no significant impairments were identified in the men whose fathers were older than 29 years at the time of their birth (e.g. the mean difference in test score in the offspring of fathers aged 40 to 44 years were -0.03 [95% CI (-0.27 to 0.20)] compared with fathers aged 25 to 29 years).We did not find that the offspring of older fathers had impaired cognitive ability as young adults. Whereas, we found a tendency that the offspring of teen fathers have lower cognitive ability. Thus, our results suggest that any potentially deleterious effects of older fathers on general cognitive ability as young adults may be counter-balanced by other potentially beneficial factors."

Pathogenesis of B. cepacia infection involves adherence, colonisation, invasion, survival and persistence in the host. In addition, B. cepacia are also known to secrete factors, which are associated with virulence in the pathogenesis of the infection. In this study, the host factor that may be the cause of the infection was elucidated in human epithelial cell line, A549, that was exposed to live B. cepacia (mid-log phase) and its secretory proteins (mid-log and early-stationary phases) using the Illumina Human Ref-8 microarray platform. The non-infection A549 cells were used as a control. Expression of the host genes that are related to apoptosis, inflammation and cell cycle as well as metabolic pathways were differentially regulated during the infection. Apoptosis of the host cells and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines were found to be inhibited by both live B. cepacia and its secretory proteins. In contrast, the host cell cycle and metabolic processes, particularly glycolysis/glycogenesis and fatty acid metabolism were transcriptionally up-regulated during the infection. Our microarray analysis provided preliminary insights into mechanisms of B. cepacia pathogenesis. The understanding of host response to an infection would provide novel therapeutic targets both for enhancing the host's defences and repressing detrimental responses induced by the invading pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2000806381,"Recessive mutations in XPNPEP3, encoding a mitochondrial x-prolyl aminopeptidase, have been identified in families with a rare hereditary tubulointerstitial kidney disease. The yeast ortholog of XPNPEP3, Icp55p, participates in the proteolytic processing and stabilization of mitochondrial proteins and its deletion accelerates the degradation of its protein targets. We used icp55 deletion strains of S. cerevisiae to model loss of XPNPEP3 enzymatic function and study its phenotypic consequences on mitochondrial function. We found that Icp55p is not required for respiratory competence; however, compared to controls deletion strains had reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption when grown in glucose containing media. The reduced mitochondrial respiration of icp55 deletion strains in glucose media requires the mitochondrial peptide transporter, Mdl1p, and was corrected by Tor1p inhibition with rapamycin. Under similar growth conditions the abundance of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex was decreased in the icp55 deletion strain and was corrected by concurrent deletion of tor1. The icp55 deletion strain demonstrated an increased chronological lifespan and decreased reactive oxygen species. These changes were additive to similar changes known to occur in tor1 deletion strains suggesting independent mechanisms. Together, these results demonstrate that loss of Icp55p function reduces mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP synthase complex assembly in glucose media, while also promoting stress resistance, decreasing reactive oxygen species and increasing chronological lifespan through mechanisms that are distinct from decreased Tor1p activity."
https://openalex.org/W2013337025,"Terrestrial tortoises are the most endangered group of vertebrates but they are still largely ignored for defining global conservation priorities. In this paper, we explored within a hierarchical framework the potential contribution of prioritization studies at the continental scale to the planning of local initiatives for the conservation of African tortoises at the regional level. First, we modeled the distribution of all the African tortoise species, we calculated three indicators of conservation priority (i.e. species richness, conservation value, and complementarity), and we carried out a gap analysis at continental scale. Second, we focused on the most important region for tortoise conservation and performed the same analyses at higher resolution. Finally, we compared the results from the two scales for understanding the degree to which they are complementary. Southern Africa emerged from the continental analysis as the most important region for tortoises. Within this area, the high-resolution analysis pointed out specific core sites for conservation. The relative degree of species protection was assessed similarly at the two different resolutions. Two species appeared particularly vulnerable at both scales. Priority indices calculated at high resolution were correlated to the values calculated for the corresponding cells at low resolution but the congruence was stronger for species richness. Our results suggest to integrate the calculation of conservation value and complementarity into a hierarchical framework driven by species richness. The advantages of large scale planning include its broad perspective on complementarity and the capability to identify regions with greatest conservation potential. In this light, continental analyses allow targeting fine scale studies toward regions with maximum priority. The regional analyses at fine scale allow planning conservation measure at a resolution similar to that required for the practical implementation, reducing the uncertainty associated with low resolution studies."

Expression of TEL-Syk transforms interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 cells in vitro by deregulating STAT5-mediated signal transduction pathways. In vivo, TEL-Syk expression in pre-B cells blocks B cell differentiation, leading to lymphoid leukemia. Here, we demonstrate that TEL-Syk introduced into fetal liver hematopoietic cells, which are then adoptively transferred into lethally irradiated recipients, leads to an aggressive myelodysplasia with myelofibrosis that is lethal in mice by 60-75 days. Expression of TEL-Syk induces a short-lived myeloexpansion that is rapidly followed by bone marrow failure and extreme splenic/hepatic fibrosis accompanied by extensive apoptosis. The disease is dependent on Syk kinase activity. Analysis of serum from TEL-Syk mice reveals an inflammatory cytokine signature reminiscent of that found in the sera from patients and mouse models of myeloproliferative neoplasms. TEL-Syk expressing cells showed constitutive STAT5 phosphorylation, which was resistant to JAK inhibition, consistent with deregulated cytokine signaling. These data indicate that expression of TEL-Syk in fetal liver hematopoietic cells results in JAK-independent STAT5 phosphorylation ultimately leading to a uniquely aggressive and lethal form of myelofibrosis."

Whether the size of the choice set affects clinicians' decision processes and strategy selection, and the quality of their choice, as it does their older patients, is an important question with serious financial consequences. Seventy medical students and internal medicine residents completed a within-subject design using Mouselab, a computer program that allows the information-acquisition process to be examined. We examined highly numerate physician trainees' decision processes, strategy, and their ability to pick the cheapest drug plan-as price was deemed the most important factor in Medicare beneficiaries' plan choice-from either 3 or 9 drug plans. Before adjustment, participants were significantly more likely to identify the lowest cost plan when facing three versus nine choices (67.3% vs. 32.8%, p<0.01) and paid significantly less in excess premiums ($60.00 vs. $128.51, p<0.01). Compared to the three-plan condition, in the nine-plan condition participants spent significantly less time acquiring information on each attribute (p<0.05) and were more likely to employ decision strategies focusing on comparing alternate plans across a single attribute (search pattern, p<0.05). After adjusting for decision process and strategy, numeracy, and amount of medical training, the odds were 10.75 times higher that trainees would choose the lowest cost Medicare Part D drug plan when facing 3 versus 9 drug plans (p<0.05). Although employing more efficient search strategies in the complex choice environment, physician trainees experienced similar difficulty in choosing the lowest cost prescription drug plans as older patients do. Our results add further evidence that simplifications to the Medicare Part D decision environment are needed and suggest physicians' role in their patients' Part D choices may be most productive when assisting seniors with forecasting their expected medication needs and then referring them to the Medicare website or helpline."
https://openalex.org/W2015511307,"Semantic technology plays a key role in various domains, from conversation understanding to algorithm analysis. As the most efficient semantic tool, ontology can represent, process and manage the widespread knowledge. Nowadays, many researchers use ontology to collect and organize data's semantic information in order to maximize research productivity. In this paper, we firstly describe our work on the development of a remote sensing data ontology, with a primary focus on semantic fusion-driven research for big data. Our ontology is made up of 1,264 concepts and 2,030 semantic relationships. However, the growth of big data is straining the capacities of current semantic fusion and reasoning practices. Considering the massive parallelism of DNA strands, we propose a novel DNA-based semantic fusion model. In this model, a parallel strategy is developed to encode the semantic information in DNA for a large volume of remote sensing data. The semantic information is read in a parallel and bit-wise manner and an individual bit is converted to a base. By doing so, a considerable amount of conversion time can be saved, i.e., the cluster-based multi-processes program can reduce the conversion time from 81,536 seconds to 4,937 seconds for 4.34 GB source data files. Moreover, the size of result file recording DNA sequences is 54.51 GB for parallel C program compared with 57.89 GB for sequential Perl. This shows that our parallel method can also reduce the DNA synthesis cost. In addition, data types are encoded in our model, which is a basis for building type system in our future DNA computer. Finally, we describe theoretically an algorithm for DNA-based semantic fusion. This algorithm enables the process of integration of the knowledge from disparate remote sensing data sources into a consistent, accurate, and complete representation. This process depends solely on ligation reaction and screening operations instead of the ontology."
