https://openalex.org/W1980745639,"Achieving high resolution under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions with the force microscope can be difficult for reactive surfaces, where the interaction forces between the tip and the samples can be relatively large. A force detection scheme that makes use of a modified cantilever beam and senses the force gradient through frequency modulation is described. The reconstructed silicon (111)-(7×7) surface was imaged in a noncontact mode by force microscopy with atomic resolution (6 angstroms lateral, 0.1 angstrom vertical)."

Semiconductor light sources are attractive owing to their reliability and amenability to mass manufacture. However, large band gaps are required to achieve blue color. A class of compound semiconductors formed by metal nitrides, GaN and its allied compounds AIGaN and InGaN, exhibits properties well suited for not only blue and blue-green emitters, but also for ultraviolet emitters and detectors. What thwarted engineers and scientists from fabricating useful devices from these materials in the past was the poor quality of material and lack of p-type doping. Both of these obstacles have recently been overcome to the point where highluminosity blue and blue-green light-emitting diodes are now available in the marketplace."
https://openalex.org/W2012299619,"Recent advances in radiometric dating and isotopic stratigraphy have resulted in a different placement of the Permian-Triassic boundary within the sedimentary sequence of the Sydney Basin of southeastern Australia. This boundary at 251 million years ago was a time of abrupt decline in both diversity and provincialism of floras in southeastern Australia and extinction of the Glossopteris flora. Early Triassic vegetation was low in diversity and dominated by lycopods and voltzialean conifers. The seed fern Dicroidium appeared in the wake of Permian-Triassic boundary floral reorganization, but floras dominated by Dicroidium did not attain Permian levels of diversity and provinciality until the Middle Triassic (244 million years ago)."

High water pressures appear to be accompanied by a reduction in the coupling of ice with the bed that is sufficient to reduce or eliminate shearing. The instability of large ice masses may result from similar decoupling rather than from pervasive bed deformation, as has been commonly thought."
https://openalex.org/W2061412679,"The solar neutrino puzzle is deepening into a paradox that refutes the basic logic of the reaction chain that powers the sun by the fusion of protons into heavy elements. Experiments now reveal a serious anomaly in the relative neutrino fluxes from the different steps in the chain. Neutrinos from boron-8 at the end of the chain are seen but hardly any are seen from beryllium-7, without which the observed boron-8 cannot be made. The only apparent way to avoid a paradoxical ""missing link"" in the sun's energy chain is a nonzero neutrino mass, an idea that can be tested in future experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2073275720,"Leaf-cutting ants harvest fresh vegetation that they then use as food for symbiotic fungi. When cutting leaf fragments, the ants produce high-frequency vibrations with a specialized organ located on the gaster. This stridulation behavior is synchronized with movements of the mandible, generating complex vibrations of the mandibles. The high vibrational acceleration of the mandible (up to three times the gravitational force at peak acceleration at about 1000 hertz) appears to stiffen the material to be cut. An identical effect is achieved when soft material is sectioned with a vibratome. This hypothesis is supported by experiments simulating the cutting process with vibrating isolated mandibles: When tender leaves were cut, the vibration of the mandible reduced force fluctuations and thus permitted a smoother cut to be made."
https://openalex.org/W2026464905,"The surface microstructure of c-axis (Ca,Sr)CuO(2) thin films, grown by laser molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO(3)(001) substrates, was studied by ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Images were obtained for codeposited Ca1-xSrxCuO(2) thin films, which show a layered-type growth mode. The surfaces consist of atomically flat terraces separated by steps that are one unit cell high. A pronounced dependence of the growth mechanism on the Sr/Ca ratio of the films was observed. Atomic resolution STM images of the CuO(2) sheets in the ab plane show a square lattice with an in-plane spacing of 4 angstroms; the lattice contains different concentrations of point defects, depending on the polarity of the sample-tip bias."

https://openalex.org/W2077211080,"The feasibility of using negative ion chemistry to mitigate stratospheric ozone depletion by chlorine-containing radicals, as proposed recently, is addressed here. Previous in situ measurements of the negative ion composition of the stratosphere show that chlorine-containing ions represent only a small fraction of total ions. New measurements of the negative ion temporal evolution in the stratosphere show that the fractional abundance of chlorine-containing ions is never greater than 1 percent at any time in the ion evolution. On the basis of these and other arguments, using negative ion chemistry to mitigate ozone depletion by chlorine-containing compounds is not feasible."

And that may have been fitting, given the meeting's focus on sudden events in Earth history: the first moments of fault rupture, repeated outbursts of icebergs during the last ice age, and a shift in the seasons in the middle of this century."
