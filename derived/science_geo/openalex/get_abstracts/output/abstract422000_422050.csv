https://openalex.org/W2005792762,"Amyloid protein is well known to induce neuronal cell death, whereas only little is known about its effect on astrocytes. We found that amyloid peptides activated caspase 3 and induced apoptosis in primary cultured astrocytes, which was prevented by caspase 3 inhibition. Apoptosis was also prevented by shRNA-mediated down-regulation of PAR-4, a protein sensitizing cells to the sphingolipid ceramide. Consistent with a potentially proapoptotic effect of PAR-4 and ceramide, astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques in brain sections of the 5xFAD mouse (and Alzheimer disease patient brain) showed caspase 3 activation and were apoptotic when co-expressing PAR-4 and ceramide. Apoptosis was not observed in astrocytes with deficient neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), indicating that ceramide generated by nSMase2 is critical for amyloid-induced apoptosis. Antibodies against PAR-4 and ceramide prevented amyloid-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that apoptosis was mediated by exogenous PAR-4 and ceramide, potentially associated with secreted lipid vesicles. This was confirmed by the analysis of lipid vesicles from conditioned medium showing that amyloid peptide induced the secretion of PAR-4 and C18 ceramide-enriched exosomes. Exosomes were not secreted by nSMase2-deficient astrocytes, indicating that ceramide generated by nSMase2 is critical for exosome secretion. Consistent with the ceramide composition in amyloid-induced exosomes, exogenously added C18 ceramide restored PAR-4-containing exosome secretion in nSMase2-deficient astrocytes. Moreover, isolated PAR-4/ceramide-enriched exosomes were taken up by astrocytes and induced apoptosis in the absence of amyloid peptide. Taken together, we report a novel mechanism of apoptosis induction by PAR-4/ceramide-enriched exosomes, which may critically contribute to Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2109537367,"Synthesis of truncated androgen receptor (AR) splice variants has emerged as an important mechanism of prostate cancer (PCa) resistance to AR-targeted therapy and progression to a lethal castration-resistant phenotype. However, the precise role of these factors at this stage of the disease is not clear due to loss of multiple COOH-terminal AR protein domains, including the canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the AR hinge region. Despite loss of this NLS, we show that diverse truncated AR variant species have a basal level of nuclear localization sufficient for ligand-independent transcriptional activity. Whereas full-length AR requires Hsp90 and importin-Î² for active nuclear translocation, basal nuclear localization of truncated AR variants is independent of these classical signals. For a subset of truncated AR variants, this basal level of nuclear import can be augmented by unique COOH-terminal sequences that reconstitute classical AR NLS activity. However, this property is separable from ligand-independent transcriptional activity. Therefore, the AR splice variant core consisting of the AR NH(2)-terminal domain and DNA binding domain is sufficient for nuclear localization and androgen-independent transcriptional activation of endogenous AR target genes. Indeed, we show that truncated AR variants with nuclear as well as nuclear/cytoplasmic localization patterns can drive androgen-independent growth of PCa cells. Together, our data demonstrate that diverse truncated AR species with varying efficiencies of nuclear localization can contribute to castration-resistant PCa pathology by driving persistent ligand-independent AR transcriptional activity."

The properties of LDs vary greatly among tissues, and LD-binding proteins, the perilipin family in particular, play critical roles in determining such diversity. Overaccumulation of TAG in LDs of non-adipose tissues may cause lipotoxicity, leading to diseases such as diabetes and cardiomyopathy. However, the physiological significance of non-adipose LDs in a normal state is poorly understood. To address this issue, we generated and characterized mice deficient in perilipin 5 (Plin5), a member of the perilipin family particularly abundant in the heart. The mutant mice lacked detectable LDs, containing significantly less TAG in the heart. Particulate structures containing another LD-binding protein, Plin2, but negative for lipid staining, remained in mutant mice hearts. LDs were recovered by perfusing the heart with an inhibitor of lipase. Cultured cardiomyocytes from Plin5-null mice more actively oxidized fatty acid than those of wild-type mice. Production of reactive oxygen species was increased in the mutant mice hearts, leading to a greater decline in heart function with age. This was, however, reduced by the administration of N-acetylcysteine, a precursor of an antioxidant, glutathione. Thus, we conclude that Plin5 is essential for maintaining LDs at detectable sizes in the heart, by antagonizing lipase(s). LDs in turn prevent excess reactive oxygen species production by sequestering fatty acid from oxidation and hence suppress oxidative burden to the heart.Background: Perilipin family proteins are important in determining the properties of lipid droplets (LDs).Results: Perilipin 5-deficient mice lack detectable LDs, exhibit enhanced fatty acid oxidation, and suffer increased ROS production in the heart.Conclusion: Perilipin 5 protects the heart from oxidative burden by sequestering fatty acid from excessive oxidation.Significance: These findings may help to increase understanding of the functions of non-adipose LDs.

LDs are found in nearly all cell types, but their properties vary greatly among tissues. White adipose tissue (WAT) has large unilocular LDs that store an enormous amount of TAG in case of increased energy demand. LDs of other tissues, however, are usually much smaller. Their physiological significance is less well understood, although a possible role is in sequestering fatty acid (FA) in a chemically inert form, TAG, to circumvent the lipotoxicity of FA and its derivatives (1Schaffer J.E. Lipotoxicity. When tissues overeat.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar).

LDs carry a defined set of surface-binding proteins whose compositions differ among cell types. The perilipin family, conventionally called the PAT family, is a representative group of LD-binding proteins composed of five members (2Brasaemle D.L. Thematic review series. Adipocyte biology.

These proteins have related amino acid sequences, particularly in the amino-terminal region called the PAT1 domain (2Brasaemle D.L. Thematic review series. Adipocyte biology.

Plin2 and Plin3 are expressed in many cell types, whereas Plin4 is abundant in adipose tissue. In contrast, we (4Yamaguchi T. Matsushita S. Motojima K. Hirose F. Osumi T.

The functions of other perilipin family members are less well understood, although the proteins were shown to protect TAG from attack by lipases (17Bell M. Wang H. Chen H. McLenithan J.C. Gong D.W.

Plin2â/â mice are resistant to a high fat diet-induced hepatosteatosis (18Chang B.H. Li L. Paul A. Taniguchi S. Nannegari V. Heird W.C. Chan L.

Biol. 2006; 26: 1063-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and Plin3 compensates for the defect of Plin2 in these mice (19Sztalryd C. Bell M. Lu X. Mertz P. Hickenbottom S. Chang B.H. Chan L. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Functional compensation for adipose differentiation-related protein (ADFP) by Tip47 in an ADFP null embryonic cell line.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34341-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Some 60â70% of the large energy demand of the heart for contractile function is fulfilled by FA (20van der Vusse G.J. van Bilsen M. Glatz J.F. Cardiac fatty acid uptake and transport in health and disease.Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, the heart has an extremely high capacity of lipid turnover and particularly small LDs. We presumed that Plin5 has a critical role in determining the properties and functions of LDs in the heart, and hence it is the key to understanding the physiological significance of heart LDs. Accordingly, we generated and characterized Plin5 knock-out (Plin5â/â) mice. To our surprise, Plin5â/â mice lacked detectable LDs in the heart, substantiating the essential role of Plin5 in maintaining heart LDs. These mice suffered from an accelerated decline in heart contractile function with age, probably due to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We propose that LDs contribute to suppressing oxidative stress in the heart by sequestering FA from excessive oxidative metabolism. Plin5â/â mice were produced by using the standard gene disruption procedure (Fig. 1A). The Plin5â/â mice were backcrossed to the C57BL/6J strain (CLEA Japan, Inc.) for four generations. Plin5+/+ and Plin5â/â mice were obtained by mating respective homozygous parents. Mice were housed under standard conditions at 24â26 Â°C with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle and given free access to standard chow (CLEA Japan, Inc.) and water. For some experiments, mice were fasted overnight by food deprivation. For the treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the chemical was dissolved in water at 1.88 mg/ml and given to the mice instead of water. The treatment was continued from 16 to 18 weeks of age to the day of experiment at 30â32 weeks of age, replacing the solution every 2â3 days. Assuming that mice 30 g in body weight drink 8 ml of water per day on average (21Bachmanov A.A. Reed D.R. Beauchamp G.K. Tordoff M.G. Food intake, water intake, and drinking spout side preference of 28 mouse strains.Behav. Genet. 2002; 32: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), this dose would correspond to 500 mg of NAC/kg/day. All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by University of Hyogo for the care and use of experimental animals. Tissues were fixed with 10% formalin/PBS, incubated with 10% sucrose/PBS, and then with 20% sucrose/PBS, each overnight at 4 Â°C. The tissues were embedded in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek) and sectioned 10 Î¼m thick in a cryostat (Leica CM3050S-III). Sections were air-dried and stored at â80 Â°C until used. After removal of the O.C.T. compound by washing with water, sections were stained for lipid with 0.18% Oil Red O (ORO) in 60% isopropyl alcohol. Sections were washed with 60% isopropyl alcohol, counterstained with hematoxylin, and subjected to microscopic analysis. Cryosections as prepared above were freed from the O.C.T. compound and permeabilized with methanol for 20 min at â20 Â°C. After washing with PBS three times for 5 min each at room temperature, sections were blocked with 2% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies to Plin5 (raised in rabbit (4Yamaguchi T. Matsushita S. Motojima K. Hirose F. Osumi T. MLDP, a novel PAT family protein localized to lipid droplets and enriched in the heart, is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î±.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14232-14240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)) and Plin2 (raised in guinea pig) and diluted 1000-fold in 2% BSA/PBS overnight at 4 Â°C. Secondary antibodies, Alexa 488- and 594-conjugated anti-guinea pig and rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), respectively, were used at a 500-fold dilution in 2% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. For double staining of Plin5 and lipid, permeabilization with methanol was omitted to avoid a loss of lipid. Because of freezing and thawing of the cryosections, antibodies were allowed to access intracellular compartments, although the fluorescence signals were inevitably weaker than those obtained by usual permeabilization. Sections were first stained for Plin5 and then with 100 Î¼m Bodipy 493/503 (Molecular Probes). Samples were examined in a confocal laser microscope (Zeiss LSM510). Dissected tissues were prefixed with 2% glutaraldehyde/PBS at 4 Â°C. After being washed with PBS, tissues were fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide/PBS for 2 h at 4 Â°C. Specimens were embedded in Quetol-812 (Nissin EM), and then sectioned and observed in a JEM-1200EX (JEOL). Lipids were extracted from tissues according to a standard procedure (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar). TAG and FA levels were measured using triglyceride E-test (WAKO) and nonesterified fatty acid C-test (WAKO), respectively. Protein was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), using BSA as a standard. Protein extracts were prepared from tissues by using lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm EDTA). Protein concentrations were quantified, and the extracts were subjected to immunoblotting. Total RNA was prepared from cardiac ventricles using QIAzol reagent (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed. Target genes were amplified with a SYBR qPCR kit (KAPA Biosystems) and quantified using an ABI PRISM7000 (Applied Biosystems). The hearts from fed and fasted wild-type and Plin5â/â mice were homogenized in 500 Î¼l of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. After the removal of nuclei and cell debris by centrifugation at 700 Ã g for 10 min, 300 Î¼l of the postnuclear supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 60% sucrose and placed below a 5-ml 0â30% (w/v) sucrose gradient in a centrifuge tube. Samples were centrifuged for 6 h at a maximal gravity of 140,000 Ã g at 4 Â°C in a swinging bucket rotor, S52ST, in a Hitachi CS100GXL ultracentrifuge. Samples were collected into 24 consecutive portions of 230 Î¼l each from the top and combined into eight fractions by mixing three consecutive portions for subsequent analyses. Because a substantial amount of pellet was obtained at the bottom, it was resuspended in 230 Î¼l of 30% sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), and numbered as fraction 9. For immunoblotting, a one-third volume of fraction 9 relative to those of fractions 1â8 was loaded onto gels. In another centrifugal experiment, 0â51.2% (w/v) sucrose gradient was employed. Mice fasted overnight were perfused with 10 ml of 50 Î¼m bromoenol lactone (BEL) in saline for 6 min. The heart was then immediately isolated and analyzed. For the visualization of LDs, Nile Red staining was performed with frozen sections. In vitro lipase assay was performed as described (23Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Defective lipolysis and altered energy metabolism in mice lacking adipose triglyceride lipase.Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Ventricular myocytes were obtained as described previously (24Nakamura T.Y. Goda K. Okamoto T. Kishi T. Nakamura T. Goshima K. Contractile and morphological impairment of cultured fetal mouse myocytes induced by oxygen radicals and oxidants. Correlation with intracellular Ca2+ concentration.Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 758-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricular tissues isolated 1.5â3 days after birth were cut into small pieces and digested to produce single cells with an enzyme solution (3:1 mixture of 1 mg/ml collagenase and 0.25% trypsin in PBS). The cells obtained were seeded into collagen-coated 35-mm dishes and incubated in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation overnight, attached cells were subjected to an FA oxidation assay. In each experiment, cardiomyocytes obtained from 3 to 4 mice were seeded into six 35-mm dishes and incubated overnight, as described above. Cells were cultured for a further 2 days in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 200 Î¼m oleic acid conjugated with BSA to allow most cells to start spontaneous beating. Cells were then treated with 1 ml of preincubation medium (DMEM, 200 Î¼m oleic acid) with or without 40 Î¼m etomoxir (three dishes each) for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated in 1 ml of the assay medium (DMEM, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) containing 4 Î¼m [1-14C]palmitic acid conjugated with Î±-cyclodextrin), supplemented with or without 40 Î¼m etomoxir for 1 h. During this procedure, each 35-mm dish was uncovered and put in a covered 10-cm dish containing a piece of filter paper soaked in 1 n NaOH to trap radioactive CO2 (â1st filter paperâ). After incubation, the culture supernatants were transferred to test tubes, and the cells were dissolved in 300 Î¼l of cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were quantified for 50-Î¼l aliquots. One hundred microliters of 10% BSA followed by 150 Î¼l of 3 m perchloric acid were added to the remaining cell lysates, which were then mixed and centrifuged. The supernatants contained intracellular acid-soluble materials (ASM), representing active metabolic intermediates. The pellet was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1), and the organic layer was collected (intracellular acid-insoluble fraction, representing cellular lipids). The culture supernatants were also mixed with BSA and perchloric acid and left for 30 min at room temperature, during which time the tubes were covered with parafilm attached with NaOH-soaked filter paper to trap CO2 forced out from the culture supernatants (â2nd filter paperâ). The mixtures were then centrifuged and separated into acid-soluble (extracellular ASM, representing dead-end metabolites such as acetic acid) and acid-insoluble (extracellular acid-insoluble fraction, mostly representing unincorporated FA) fractions, as described above. The filter paper and soluble and insoluble fractions were subjected to scintillation counting. Î²-Oxidation activity was assessed by the radioactivity of CO2 (sum of radioactivities of 1st and 2nd filter papers), intracellular as well as extracellular ASM, with the first two representing metabolites en route to complete oxidation in mitochondria. Incorporation of FA was evaluated from the sum of the radioactivity of CO2, intracellular and extracellular ASM, and the intracellular acid-insoluble fraction. Values obtained for three culture dishes were averaged and used as a result of a single experiment. Blood glucose levels were determined by Glutest sensor (SKK). Serum ketone bodies were determined with a Î²-hydroxybutyrate assay kit (Cayman). Insulin was quantified using an insulin ELISA kit (Shibayagi). Mice were put in cages individually and allowed to access food and water ad libitum during the experiment. Food intake was measured for 10 days, and average intake per day was calculated. The respiratory gas analysis was performed with an Arco-2000 (Arco System), as described previously (25Matsumura S. Saitou K. Miyaki T. Yoneda T. Mizushige T. Eguchi A. Shibakusa T. Manabe Y. Tsuzuki S. Inoue K. Fushiki T. Mercaptoacetate inhibition of fatty acid Î²-oxidation attenuates the oral acceptance of fat in BALB/c mice.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 295: R82-R91Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Locomotor activity was measured with a 14-channel DAS system (Neuroscience). Heart tissue samples were homogenized in lysis buffer as described above. Protein concentrations were quantified, and the extracts were subjected to a TBARS analysis, according to a published procedure (26Ohkawa H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Assay for lipid peroxides in animal tissues by thiobarbituric acid reaction.Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (23164) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. For age-matched mice under 1.5% isoflurane anesthesia, heart rate and rhythm were monitored using 4-limb-lead electrocardiography (TMH150, Visual Sonics). Left ventricular contractile forces were quantified by transthoracic echocardiography using Vevo2100 (Visual Sonics). The percentage of left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) was calculated as follows: ((LVID;d â LVID;s)/LVID;d) Ã 100, where LVID;d and LVID;s indicate left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, respectively. When the animals were also subjected to a TBARS assay, the hearts were excised several days after the echocardiographic measurement. All data are shown as means Â± S.E. Data were analyzed with Student's t test, and differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The correlation between heart parameters and TBARS values was assessed by a regression analysis. Plin5â/â mice were generated (Fig. 1, A and B), and the absence of Plin5 mRNA and protein in tissues of mutant mice was confirmed (Fig. 1, C and D). Expression of Plin4, a close neighbor of Plin5 in the genome, was not affected (Fig. 1C). Intercrossing of Plin5+/â mice provided Plin5â/â offspring at a Mendelian ratio. Deletion of Plin5 caused no abnormality in either cumulative body weight or body length (data not shown). Weights of tissues, including the heart, were not significantly different between the two genotypes of mice at 16â20 weeks of age (data not shown). Thus, Plin5 deficiency does not cause apparent defects in growth and development. Further experiments were performed with male mice of age 16â20 weeks, unless otherwise noted. Based on the particularly abundant expression of Plin5 in the heart (4Yamaguchi T. Matsushita S. Motojima K. Hirose F. Osumi T.

Accordingly, we first stained the heart sections of wild-type and Plin5â/â mice with ORO (Fig. 2A). In wild-type mice, small LDs were observed in a limited number of heart cells in the fed state. LDs were markedly augmented upon fasting as reported previously (27Suzuki J. Shen W.J. Nelson B.D. Selwood S.P. Murphy Jr., G.M. Kanehara H. Takahashi S. Oida K. Miyamori I. Kraemer F.B.

Surprisingly, no LDs were detected in the hearts of Plin5â/â mice by ORO staining either in the fed or fasted state. By electron microscopy, LDs were not observed in the hearts of fasted Plin5â/â mice (Fig. 2B). We also measured the content of TAG and FA in the heart. Consistent with the apparent absence of LDs, the TAG content in the hearts of Plin5â/â mice was lower than that in control mice (Fig. 3A, panel a), in both fed and fasted animals. The FA level was also lower in the hearts of Plin5â/â mice than that of wild-type mice (Fig. 3B, panel a).FIGURE 3TAG and FA contents in the tissues of fed and fasted wild-type and Plin5â/â mice.

Using biophysical and biochemical approaches, we discovered that CB2 receptors can form heteromers with CB1 receptors in transfected neuronal cells and in rat brain pineal gland, nucleus accumbens, and globus pallidus. Within CB1-CB2 receptor heteromers expressed in a neuronal cell model, agonist co-activation of CB1 and CB2 receptors resulted in a negative cross-talk in Akt phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth. Moreover, one specific characteristic of CB1-CB2 receptor heteromers consists of both the ability of CB1 receptor antagonists to block the effect of CB2 receptor agonists and, conversely, the ability of CB2 receptor antagonists to block the effect of CB1 receptor agonists, showing a bidirectional cross-antagonism phenomenon. Taken together, these data illuminate the mechanism by which CB2 receptors can negatively modulate CB1 receptor function.

The endocannabinoid system is known to have a broad impact on a variety of tissues. It has been shown to heavily influence cardiovascular and immune systems as well as to control progenitor cell proliferation (1Klein T.W. Newton C. Larsen K. Lu L. Perkins I. Nong L. Friedman H.

More recently, the endocannabinoid system has emerged as a major player in the complex web of neuromodulators, constituting a new intercellular communication network mainly involved in the control of neurotransmitter release (4Piomelli D.

By acting as retrograde messengers at various synapses, these endogenous arachidonic acid derivatives participate in controlling processes, such as motor activity, memory and learning, appetite, emesis, nociception, and some motivational responses (8Ameri A.

There are two known cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, with strong evidence of a third in the form of GPR55, and all have been considered as therapeutic targets for basal ganglia disorders (15Romero J.

CB1 receptors mediate psychoactivity, whereas CB2 receptor-selective agonists lack psychoactivity but are implicated in the control of fundamental neural cell processes, such as proliferation and survival, and their pharmacological manipulation might be useful for both delaying the progression of neurodegenerative disorders and inhibiting the growth of glial tumors (17Palazuelos J.

CB1 is the most abundant receptor in the central nervous system, and, besides its classical influence on mood and emotion, it has been demonstrated to play a role in the modulation of memory processing and in metabolism (19Zanettini C.

The ubiquitous expression pattern of CB1 receptors reflects the complexity and the variety of functions the endocannabinoid system impacts in neuronal activity. CB1 receptors are often localized presynaptically, where their stimulation usually inhibits neurotransmitter release (4Piomelli D. The molecular logic of endocannabinoid signaling.Nat. Rev.

Presynaptically, CB1 receptors are localized in GABAergic terminals of interneurons or collaterals from medium spiny neurons and also in glutamatergic but not in dopaminergic terminals (23Pickel V.M.

The related receptor, CB2, traditionally was thought to be expressed in peripheral tissue, where it can help control inflammation and various immunological responses (1Klein T.W. Newton C. Larsen K.

Other supplements were 2 mm l-glutamine for HEK-293T and SH-SY5Y cells, 1 mm sodium pyruvate for SH-SY5Y cells, and 100 Î¼m hypoxanthine, 0.02 Î¼m aminopterin, 16 Î¼m thymidine (HAT supplement) for NG108-15 cells. The human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS. All supplements were from Invitrogen. Cells were maintained at 37 Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and were passaged when they were 80â90% confluent (i.e. approximately twice a week). HEK-293T or SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with the corresponding fusion protein cDNA by the ramified PEI (Sigma) method. Cells were incubated (4 h) with the corresponding cDNA together with ramified PEI (5 ml of 10 mm PEI for each mg of cDNA) and 150 mm NaCl in a serum-starved medium. After 4 h, the medium was changed to a fresh complete culture medium. 72 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in quick succession in Hanks' balanced salt solution (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4Â·12H2O, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 1.26 mm CaCl2Â·2H2O, 0.4 mm MgSO4Â·7H2O, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1% glucose (w/v), detached by gently pipetting, and resuspended in the same buffer. To control the cell number, sample protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin dilutions as standards. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (3 month old, â¼350 g), receiving water and food ad libitum, were obtained from the animal facility of the Faculty of Biology (University of Barcelona). 4% isoflurane (2-chloro-2-(difluoromethoxy)-1,1,1-trifluoroethane)-anesthetized animals were killed by decapitation at 20:00 h (after the light period), and pineal glands were immediately dissected. All procedures were approved by the Catalan Ethical Committee for Animal Use (CEAA/DMAH 4049 and 5664). Pinealocytes were prepared from rat pineal glands as described previously by da Silveira Cruz-Machado et al. (51da Silveira Cruz-Machado S. Carvalho-Sousa C.E. Tamura E.K. Pinato L. Cecon E. Fernandes P.A. de Avellar M.C. Ferreira Z.S. Markus R.P. TLR4 and CD14 receptors expressed in rat pineal gland trigger NFKB pathway.J. Pineal Res. 2010; 49: 183-192PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, pinealocytes were obtained by trypsinization (0.25%, 37 Â°C, 15 min) followed by mechanical dispersion in the presence of fetal bovine serum. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in defined culture medium BGJb (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (pH 7.4). The total number of cells and fractional survival was estimated by trypan blue exclusion. Cells (200,000 cells/well) were plated on polylysine-coated 6-well chamber plates and maintained at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2 for 48 h prior to use. Rats were decapitated with a guillotine, and the brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold oxygenated (O2/CO2, 95%/5%) Krebs-HCO3â buffer (124 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 26 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4). The brains were sliced at 4 Â°C in a brain matrix (Zivic Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA) into 0.5-mm coronal slices. Slices were kept at 4 Â°C in Krebs-HCO3â buffer during the dissection of the nucleus accumbens and the globus pallidus. For signaling experiments, each slice was transferred into an incubation tube containing 1 ml of ice-cold Krebs-HCO3â buffer, and the ERK1/2 phosphorylation was determined as described below. For proximity ligation assays, slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. The slices were then washed in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.8) and treated for 5 min with 1% Na2BH4 dissolved in TBS, followed by successive TBS washes until all Na2BH4 was eliminated. Finally, the slices were cryopreserved in a 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4 Â°C and stored at â20 Â°C until sectioning. 15-Î¼m-thick slices were cut on a freezing cryostat (Leica Jung CM-3000) and mounted on slide glass. Slices were thawed at 4 Â°C, washed in TBS, and rocked with the blocking solution (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 h at 37 Â°C in a humidified atmosphere. Primary cultures of pinealocytes or SH-SY5Y cells transfected or not with 3 Î¼g of cDNA corresponding to CB2R-HA (Missouri S&T Resource Center), were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 20 mm glycine to quench the aldehyde groups. After permeabilization with PBS-glycine containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 5 min, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Rat nucleus accumbens slices were obtained as described above. The receptor-receptor molecular interaction in these samples was detected using the Duolink II in situ PLA detection kit (Olink Bioscience). To detect heteromers in pinealocytes or in nucleus accumbens slices, the direct PLA-linked primary antibodies were used. The rabbit anti-CB1 receptor antibody (Thermo Scientific) was linked to a plus PLA probe, and the rabbit anti-CB2 receptor antibody (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) was linked to a minus PLA probe following the instructions of the supplier. After a 1-h incubation at 37 Â°C with the blocking solution in a preheated humidity chamber, pinealocytes or slices were incubated overnight with these PLA probe-linked antibodies (1:1000) at 4 Â°C. After washing with wash buffer at room temperature, samples were processed for ligation, amplification, and detection as described by the manufacturer. As negative controls, pinealocytes or slices were incubated overnight with the plus PLA probe-linked rabbit anti-CB1 receptor antibody and a goat anti-D4 receptor primary antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 Â°C, followed by an incubation (2 h, 37 Â°C) in a preheated humidity chamber with Duolink II minus PLA probe anti-goat diluted in the antibody diluent. To detect heteromers in SH-SY5Y cells, transfected or non-transfected (as negative controls) cells were incubated (1 h, 37 Â°C) with the blocking solution in a preheated humidity chamber and then incubated overnight with the primary antibodies: rabbit anti-CB1 receptor antibody (1:1000; Thermo Scientific) and mouse monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) in the antibody diluent medium. SH-SY5Y cells were washed with washing buffer at room temperature and incubated (2 h, 37 Â°C) in a preheated humidity chamber with PLA probes detecting rabbit or mouse antibodies (Duolink II plus PLA probe anti-rabbit and Duolink II minus PLA probe anti-mouse) and processed as described above. Samples were mounted using the mounting medium with DAPI and observed in a Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). After 72 h of transfection, HEK-292T cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed with PBS containing 20 mm glycine to quench the aldehyde groups. After permeabilization with PBS-glycine containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 5 min, cells were incubated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After 1 h at room temperature, protein-Rluc was labeled with the primary mouse monoclonal anti-Rluc antibody (1:100; Chemicon, Billerica, MA) for 1 h, washed, and stained with the secondary antibody Cy3 donkey anti-mouse (1:200; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Protein-YFP was detected by its fluorescence properties. The samples were rinsed several times and mounted with a medium suitable for immunofluorescence (30% Mowiol, Calbiochem). The samples were observed in a Leica SP2 confocal microscope. Total cellula"

We had observed that pigs infected with Trichuris suis for 21 days showed significant changes in the proximal colon microbiota. In this study, interactions between worm burden and severity of disruptions to the microbial composition and metabolic potentials in the porcine proximal colon microbiota were investigated using metagenomic tools. Pigs were infected by a single dose of T. suis eggs for 53 days. Among infected pigs, two cohorts were differentiated that either had adult worms or were worm-free. Infection resulted in a significant change in the abundance of approximately 13% of genera detected in the proximal colon microbiota regardless of worm status, suggesting a relatively persistent change over time in the microbiota due to the initial infection. A significant reduction in the abundance of Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus indicated a change in the fibrolytic capacity of the colon microbiota in T. suis infected pigs. In addition, â¼10% of identified KEGG pathways were affected by infection, including ABC transporters, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis as well as Î±-linolenic acid metabolism. Trichuris suis infection modulated host immunity to Campylobacter because there was a 3-fold increase in the relative abundance in the colon microbiota of infected pigs with worms compared to naÃ¯ve controls, but a 3-fold reduction in worm-free infected pigs compared to controls. The level of pathology observed in infected pigs with worms compared to worm-free infected pigs may relate to the local host response because expression of several Th2-related genes were enhanced in infected pigs with worms versus those worm-free. Our findings provided insight into the dynamics of the proximal colon microbiota in pigs in response to T. suis infection."
https://openalex.org/W2045203842,"CTCF is a highly conserved, multifunctional zinc finger protein involved in critical aspects of gene regulation including transcription regulation, chromatin insulation, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and higher order chromatin organization. Such multifunctional properties of CTCF suggest an essential role in development. Indeed, a previous report on maternal depletion of CTCF suggested that CTCF is essential for pre-implantation development. To distinguish between the effects of maternal and zygotic expression of CTCF, we studied pre-implantation development in mice harboring a complete loss of function Ctcf knockout allele. Although we demonstrated that homozygous deletion of Ctcf is early embryonically lethal, in contrast to previous observations, we showed that the Ctcf nullizygous embryos developed up to the blastocyst stage (E3.5) followed by peri-implantation lethality (E4.5âE5.5). Moreover, one-cell stage Ctcf nullizygous embryos cultured ex vivo developed to the 16â32 cell stage with no obvious abnormalities. Using a single embryo assay that allowed both genotype and mRNA expression analyses of the same embryo, we demonstrated that pre-implantation development of the Ctcf nullizygous embryos was associated with the retention of the maternal wild type Ctcf mRNA. Loss of this stable maternal transcript was temporally associated with loss of CTCF protein expression, apoptosis of the developing embryo, and failure to further develop an inner cell mass and trophoectoderm ex vivo. This indicates that CTCF expression is critical to early embryogenesis and loss of its expression rapidly leads to apoptosis at a very early developmental stage. This is the first study documenting the presence of the stable maternal Ctcf transcript in the blastocyst stage embryos. Furthermore, in the presence of maternal CTCF, zygotic CTCF expression does not seem to be required for pre-implantation development."
https://openalex.org/W2046672558,"Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) causes urethritis, cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease. The MG treatment failure rate using 1 g azithromycin at an Australian Sexual Health clinic in 2007-9 was 31% (95%CI 23-40%). We developed a rapid high resolution melt analysis (HRMA) assay targeting resistance mutations in the MG 23S rRNA gene, and validated it against DNA sequencing by examining pre- and post-treatment archived samples from MG-infected patients.Available MG-positive pre-treatment (n = 82) and post-treatment samples from individuals with clinical treatment failure (n = 20) were screened for 23S rRNA gene mutations. Sixteen (20%) pre-treatment samples possessed resistance mutations (A2058G, A2059G, A2059C), which were significantly more common in patients with symptomatic azithromycin-treatment failure (12/26; 44%) than in those clinically cured (4/56; 7%), p<0.001. All 20 patients experiencing azithromycin-failure had detectable mutations in their post-treatment samples. In 9 of these cases, the same mutational types were present in both pre- and post-treatment samples indicating transmitted resistance, whilst in 11 of these cases (55%), mutations were absent in pre-treatment samples indicating likely selection of resistant isolates have occurred. HRMA was able to detect all mutational changes determined in this study by DNA sequencing. An additional HRMA assay incorporating an unlabelled probe was also developed to detect type 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms found in other populations, with a slightly lower sensitivity of 90%.Treatment failure is associated with the detection of macrolide resistance mutations, which appear to be almost equally due to selection of resistant isolates following exposure to 1 g azithromycin and pre-existing transmitted resistance. The application of a rapid molecular assay to detect resistance at the time of initial detection of infection allows clinicians to shorten the time to initiate effective second line treatment. This has the potential to reduce transmission of resistant strains and to avoid sequelae associated with persistent untreated infection."
https://openalex.org/W2095375670,"Pathogenic generation of amyloid Î²-peptide (AÎ²) by sequential cleavage of Î²-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Î²- and Î³-secretases is widely believed to causally underlie Alzheimer disease (AD). Î²-Secretase initially cleaves APP thereby generating a membrane-bound APP C-terminal fragment, from which Î³-secretase subsequently liberates 37-43-amino acid long AÎ² species. Although the latter cleavages are intramembranous and although lipid alterations have been implicated in AD, little is known of how the Î³-secretase-mediated release of the various AÎ² species, in particular that of the pathogenic longer variants AÎ²(42) and AÎ²(43), is affected by the lipid environment. Using a cell-free system, we have directly and systematically investigated the activity of Î³-secretase reconstituted in defined model membranes of different thicknesses. We found that bilayer thickness is a critical parameter affecting both total activity as well as cleavage specificity of Î³-secretase. Whereas the generation of the pathogenic AÎ²(42/43) species was markedly attenuated in thick membranes, that of the major and rather benign AÎ²(40) species was enhanced. Moreover, the increased production of AÎ²(42/43) by familial AD mutants of presenilin 1, the catalytic subunit of Î³-secretase, could be substantially lowered in thick membranes. Our data demonstrate an effective modulation of Î³-secretase activity by membrane thickness, which may provide an approach to lower the generation of the pathogenic AÎ²(42/43) species."
https://openalex.org/W1986247562,"Despite the importance of microRNAs (miRs) for regulation of the delicate balance between cell proliferation and death, evidence for their specific involvement during death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis is scarce. Transfection with miR-133b rendered resistant HeLa cells sensitive to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±)-induced cell death. Similarly, miR-133b caused exacerbated proapoptotic responses to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or an activating antibody to Fas/CD95. Comprehensive analysis, encompassing global RNA or protein expression profiling performed by microarray experiments and pulsed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (pSILAC), led to the discovery of the antiapoptotic protein Fas apoptosis inhibitory molecule (FAIM) as immediate miR-133b target. Moreover, miR-133b impaired the expression of the detoxifying protein glutathione-S-transferase pi (GSTP1). Expression of miR-133b in tumor specimens of prostate cancer patients was significantly downregulated in 75% of the cases, when compared with matched healthy tissue. Furthermore, introduction of synthetic miR-133b into an ex-vivo model of prostate cancer resulted in impaired proliferation and cellular metabolic activity. PC3 cells were also sensitized to apoptotic stimuli after transfection with miR-133b similar to HeLa cells. These data reveal the ability of a single miR to influence major apoptosis pathways, suggesting an essential role for this molecule during cellular transformation, tumorigenesis and tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2123234696,"Background Response rates for surveys of alcohol use are declining for all modes of administration (postal, telephone, face-to-face). Low response rates may result in estimates that are biased by selective non-response. We examined non-response bias in the NZ GENACIS survey, a postal survey of a random electoral roll sample, with a response rate of 49.5% (n = 1924). Our aim was to estimate the magnitude of non-response bias in estimating the prevalence of current drinking and heavy episodic (binge) drinking. Methods We used the âcontinuum of resistanceâ model to guide the investigation. In this model the likelihood of response by sample members is related to the amount of effort required from the researchers to elicit a response. First, the demographic characteristics of respondents and non-respondents were compared. Second, respondents who returned their questionnaire before the first reminder (early), before the second reminder (intermediate) or after the second reminder (late) were compared by demographic characteristics, 12-month prevalence of drinking and prevalence of binge drinking. Results Demographic characteristics and prevalence of binge drinking were significantly different between late respondents and early/intermediate respondents, with the demographics of early and intermediate respondents being similar to people who refused to participate while late respondents were similar to all other non-respondents. Assuming non-respondents who did not actively refuse to participate had the same drinking patterns as late respondents, the prevalence of binge drinking amongst current drinkers was underestimated. Adjusting the prevalence of binge drinkers amongst current drinkers using population weights showed that this method of adjustment still resulted in an underestimate of the prevalence. Conclusions The findings suggest non-respondents who did not actively refuse to participate are likely to have similar or more extreme drinking behaviours than late respondents, and that surveys of health compromising behaviours such as alcohol use are likely to underestimate the prevalence of these behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W1973334614,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmetal disorder associated with mutations in the methyl-CpGâbinding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene. MeCP2-deficient mice recapitulate the neurological degeneration observed in RTT patients. Recent studies indicated a role of not only neurons but also glial cells in neuronal dysfunction in RTT. We cultured astrocytes from MeCP2-null mouse brain and examined astroglial gene expression, growth rate, cytotoxic effects, and glutamate (Glu) clearance. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that expression of astroglial marker genes, including GFAP and S100Î², was significantly higher in MeCP2-null astrocytes than in control astrocytes. Loss of MeCP2 did not affect astroglial cell morphology, growth, or cytotoxic effects, but did alter Glu clearance in astrocytes. When high extracellular Glu was added to the astrocyte cultures and incubated, a time-dependent decrease of extracellular Glu concentration occurred due to Glu clearance by astrocytes. Although the shapes of the profiles of Glu concentration versus time for each strain of astrocytes were grossly similar, Glu concentration in the medium of MeCP2-null astrocytes were lower than those of control astrocytes at 12 and 18 h. In addition, MeCP2 deficiency impaired downregulation of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 and 2 (EAAT1/2) transcripts, but not induction of glutamine synthetase (GS) transcripts, upon high Glu exposure. In contrast, GS protein was significantly higher in MeCP2-null astrocytes than in control astrocytes. These findings suggest that MeCP2 affects astroglial genes expression in cultured astrocytes, and that abnormal Glu clearance in MeCP2-deficient astrocytes may influence the onset and progression of RTT."
https://openalex.org/W2072043666,"Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is an immunoreceptor predominantly expressed on exhausted T cells, which through an interaction with its ligand (PD-L1), controls peripheral tolerance by limiting effector functions of T lymphocytes. qRT-PCR for PD-1, PD-L1 and their splicing forms as well as flow cytometric assessment of surface expression was performed in a cohort of 58 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. In functional studies, we assessed the influence of the proliferative response of leukemic B-cells induced by IL-4 and CD40L on PD-1 transcripts and expression on the protein level. The median level of PD-1, but not PD-L1, transcripts in CLL patients was higher in comparison to healthy volunteers (HVs, n = 43, p = 0.0057). We confirmed the presence of PD-1 and PD-L1 on the CLL cell surface, and found the expression of PD-1, but not PD-L1, to be higher among CLL patients in comparison to HVs (47.2% vs. 14.8%, p<0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier curves for the time to progression and overall survival in groups with high and low surface expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 revealed no prognostic value in CLL patients. After stimulation with IL-4 and CD40L, protein expression of PD-1 was significantly increased in samples that responded and up-regulated CD38. PD-1, which is aberrantly expressed both at mRNA and cell surface levels in CLL cells might represent a novel immunotolerant molecule involved in the pathomechanism of the disease, and could provide a novel target for future therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2085446920,"Subthreshold depression is highly prevalent in the general population and causes great loss to society especially in the form of reduced productivity while at work (presenteeism). We developed a highly-structured manualized eight-session cognitive-behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists (tCBT).We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre-existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan. The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire (HPQ). In the course of the trial the follow-up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study.The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual. Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP (n = 58) and to EAP alone (n = 60). The BDI-II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group after 4 months (p<0.001, Effect size = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.32 to 1.05). However, there was no statistically significant decrease in absolute and relative presenteeism (p = 0.44, ES = 0.15, -0.21 to 0.52, and p = 0.50, ES = 0.02, -0.34 to 0.39, respectively).Remote CBT, including tCBT, may provide easy access to quality-assured effective psychotherapy for people in the work force who present with subthreshold depression. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in longer terms. The study was funded by Sekisui Chemicals Co. Ltd.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00885014."
https://openalex.org/W2040041432,"Mild hypothermia is the only effective treatment confirmed clinically to improve neurological outcomes for comatose patients with cardiac arrest. However, the underlying mechanism is not fully elucidated. In this study, our aim was to determine the effect of mild hypothermia on mitochondrial oxidative stress in the cerebral cortex. We intravascularly induced mild hypothermia (33Â°C), maintained this temperature for 12 h, and actively rewarmed in the inbred Chinese Wuzhishan minipigs successfully resuscitated after 8 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation. Cerebral samples were collected at 24 and 72 h following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). We found that mitochondrial malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels were significantly increased in the cerebral cortex in normothermic pigs even at 24 h after ROSC, whereas mild hypothermia attenuated this increase. Moreover, mild hypothermia attenuated the decrease in Complex I and Complex III (i.e., major sites of reactive oxygen species production) activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and increased antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity. This increase in MnSOD activity was consistent with the upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA and protein expressions, and with the increase of Nrf2 nuclear translocation in normothermic pigs at 24 and 72 h following ROSC, whereas mild hypothermia enhanced these tendencies. Thus, our findings indicate that mild hypothermia attenuates mitochondrial oxidative stress in the cerebral cortex, which may be associated with reduced impairment of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, and enhancement of MnSOD activity and expression via Nrf2 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2001178856,"Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved process that is linked to diurnal cycles and normal daytime wakefulness. Healthy sleep and wakefulness are integral to a healthy lifestyle; this occurs when an organism is able to maintain long bouts of both sleep and wake. Homer proteins, which function as adaptors for group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors, have been implicated in genetic studies of sleep in both Drosophila and mouse. Drosophila express a single Homer gene product that is upregulated during sleep. By contrast, vertebrates express Homer as both constitutive and immediate early gene (H1a) forms, and H1a is up-regulated during wakefulness. Genetic deletion of Homer in Drosophila results in fragmented sleep and in failure to sustain long bouts of sleep, even under increased sleep drive. However, deletion of Homer1a in mouse results in failure to sustain long bouts of wakefulness. Further evidence for the role of Homer1a in the maintenance of wake comes from the CREB alpha delta mutant mouse, which displays a reduced wake phenotype similar to the Homer1a knockout and fails to up-regulate Homer1a upon sleep loss. Homer1a is a gene whose expression is induced by CREB. Sustained behaviors of the sleep/wake cycle are created by molecular pathways that are distinct from those for arousal or short bouts, and implicate an evolutionarily-conserved role for Homer in sustaining these behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2090973056,"Integrating POC CD4 testing technologies into HIV counseling and testing (HCT) programs may improve post-HIV testing linkage to care and treatment. As evaluations of these technologies in program settings continue, estimates of the costs of POC CD4 tests to the service provider will be needed and estimates have begun to be reported. Without a consistent and transparent methodology, estimates of the cost per CD4 test using POC technologies are likely to be difficult to compare and may lead to erroneous conclusions about costs and cost-effectiveness. This paper provides a step-by-step approach for estimating the cost per CD4 test from a provider's perspective. As an example, the approach is applied to one specific POC technology, the Pima Analyzer. The costing approach is illustrated with data from a mobile HCT program in Gauteng Province of South Africa. For this program, the cost per test in 2010 was estimated at $23.76 (material costs = $8.70; labor cost per test = $7.33; and equipment, insurance, and daily quality control = $7.72). Labor and equipment costs can vary widely depending on how the program operates and the number of CD4 tests completed over time. Additional costs not included in the above analysis, for on-going training, supervision, and quality control, are likely to increase further the cost per test. The main contribution of this paper is to outline a methodology for estimating the costs of incorporating POC CD4 testing technologies into an HCT program. The details of the program setting matter significantly for the cost estimate, so that such details should be clearly documented to improve the consistency, transparency, and comparability of cost estimates."
https://openalex.org/W1973419331,"Whole transcriptome analyses have revealed a large number of novel transcripts including long and short noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Currently, there is great interest in characterizing the functions of the different classes of ncRNAs and their relevance to cellular processes. In particular, nuclear long ncRNAs may be involved in controlling various aspects of biological regulation, such as stress responses. By a combination of bioinformatic and experimental approaches, we identified 25 novel nuclear long ncRNAs from 6,088,565 full-length human cDNA sequences. Some nuclear long ncRNAs were conserved among vertebrates, whereas others were found only among primates. Expression profiling of the nuclear long ncRNAs in human tissues revealed that most were expressed ubiquitously. A subset of the identified nuclear long ncRNAs was induced by the genotoxic agents mitomycin C or doxorubicin, in HeLa Tet-off cells. There were no commonly altered nuclear long ncRNAs between mitomycin C- and doxorubicin-treated cells. These results suggest that distinct sets of nuclear long ncRNAs play roles in cellular defense mechanisms against specific genotoxic agents, and that particular long ncRNAs have the potential to be surrogate indicators of a specific cell stress."
https://openalex.org/W2032500449,"Mutations in PARK7/DJ-1 gene are associated to autosomal recessive early onset forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although large gene deletions have been linked to a loss-of-function phenotype, the pathogenic mechanism of missense mutations is less clear. The L166P mutation causes misfolding of DJ-1 protein and its degradation. L166P protein may also accumulate into insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates with a mechanism facilitated by the E3 ligase TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Upon proteasome impairment L166P activates the JNK/p38 MAPK apoptotic pathway by its interaction with TRAF and TNF Receptor Associated Protein (TTRAP). When proteasome activity is blocked in the presence of wild-type DJ-1, TTRAP forms aggregates that are localized to the cytoplasm or associated to nucleolar cavities, where it is required for a correct rRNA biogenesis. In this study we show that in post-mortem brains of sporadic PD patients TTRAP is associated to the nucleolus and to Lewy Bodies, cytoplasmic aggregates considered the hallmark of the disease. In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, misfolded mutant DJ-1 L166P alters rRNA biogenesis inhibiting TTRAP localization to the nucleolus and enhancing its recruitment into cytoplasmic aggregates with a mechanism that depends in part on TRAF6 activity. This work suggests that TTRAP plays a role in the molecular mechanisms of both sporadic and familial PD. Furthermore, it unveils the existence of an interplay between cytoplasmic and nucleolar aggregates that impacts rRNA biogenesis and involves TRAF6."
https://openalex.org/W2040165379,"The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the cardiovascular-protective effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) may be due, in part, to its ability to stimulate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation. The role of AMPK in EPA-induced eNOS phosphorylation was investigated in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), in mice deficient of either AMPKÎ±1 or AMPKÎ±2, in eNOS knockout (KO) mice, or in Apo-E/AMPKÎ±1 dual KO mice. EPA-treatment of BAEC increased both AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation and AMPK activity, which was accompanied by increased eNOS phosphorylation, NO release, and upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2). Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of AMPK abolished EPA-enhanced NO release and eNOS phosphorylation in HUVEC. This effect of EPA was absent in the aortas isolated from either eNOS KO mice or AMPKÎ±1 KO mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet. EPA via upregulation of UCP-2 activates AMPKÎ±1 resulting in increased eNOS phosphorylation and consequent improvement of endothelial function in vivo."

Neutrophils represent the major fraction of circulating immune cells, but receptors and mechanisms by which neutrophils sense RNA are poorly defined. Here, we analyzed the mRNA and protein expression patterns and the subcellular localization of the RNA receptors RIG-I, MDA-5, TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8 in primary neutrophils and immortalized neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells. Our results demonstrate that both neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells express RIG-I, MDA-5, and TLR8 at the mRNA and protein levels, whereas TLR3 and TLR7 are not expressed at the protein level. Subcellular fractionation, flow cytometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and immuno-transmission electron microscopy provided evidence that, besides the cytoplasm, RIG-I and MDA-5 are stored in secretory vesicles of neutrophils and showed that RIG-I and its ligand, 3p-RNA, co-localize at the cell surface without triggering neutrophil activation. In summary, this study demonstrates that neutrophils express a distinct pattern of RNA recognition receptors in a non-canonical way, which could have essential implications for future RNA-based therapeutics.

https://openalex.org/W2080234284,"Canonical Wnt signaling strongly inhibits chondrogenesis. Previously, we identified Twist1 as a critical downstream mediator of Wnt in repression of chondrocyte differentiation. However, the mechanistic basis for the antichondrogenic activity of Twist1 has not heretofore been established. Here, we show that Twist1 suppresses cartilage development by directly inhibiting the transcriptional activity of Sox9, the master regulator of chondrogenesis. Twist1, through its carboxyl-terminal Twist-box, binds to the Sox9 high mobility group DNA-binding domain, inhibiting Sox9 transactivation potential. In chondrocyte precursor cells, Twist1, in a Twist-box-dependent manner, inhibits Sox9-dependent activation of chondrocyte marker gene expression by blocking Sox9-enhancer DNA association. These findings identify Twist1 as an inhibitor of Sox9 and further suggest that the balance between Twist1 and Sox9 may determine the earliest steps of chondrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2037808736,"Murine protein serine-threonine kinase 38 (MPK38) is a member of the AMP-activated protein kinase-related serine/threonine kinase family. In this study, we show that MPK38 physically associates with p53 via the carboxyl-terminal domain of MPK38 and the central DNA-binding domain of p53. This interaction is increased by 5-fluorouracil or doxorubicin treatment and is responsible for Ser(15) phosphorylation of p53. Ectopic expression of wild-type Mpk38, but not kinase-dead Mpk38, stimulates p53-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner and up-regulates p53 targets, including p53, p21, MDM2, and BAX. Consistently, knockdown of MPK38 shows an opposite trend, inhibiting p53-mediated transcription. MPK38 functionally enhances p53-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in a kinase-dependent manner by stimulating p53 nuclear translocation. We also demonstrate that MPK38-mediated p53 activation is induced by removing MDM2, a negative regulator of p53, from the p53-MDM2 complex as well as by stabilization of interaction between p53 and its positive regulators, including NM23-H1, serine/threonine kinase receptor-associated protein, and 14-3-3. This leads to the enhancement of p53 stability. Together, these results suggest that MPK38 may act as a novel regulator for promoting p53 activity through direct phosphorylation of p53 at Ser(15)."

Although the bone metastasis of prostate cancer is characterized by increased ossification, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are not fully understood. Here, the roles of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in the interactions between prostate cancer cells and bone stromal cells were investigated. In human prostate cancer LNCaP cells, BMP-4 induced the production of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) through a Smad-dependent pathway. In mouse stromal MC3T3-E1 cells, SHH up-regulated the expression of activin receptor IIB (ActR-IIB) and Smad1, which in turn enhanced BMP-responsive reporter activities in these cells. The combined stimulation with BMP-4 and SHH of MC3T3-E1 cells cooperatively induced the expression of osteoblastic markers, including alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, collagen type II Î±1, and osteocalcin. When MC3T3-E1 cells and LNCaP cells were co-cultured, the osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells, which was induced by BMP-4, was accelerated by SHH from LNCaP cells. Furthermore, LNCaP cells and BMP-4 cooperatively induced the production of growth factors, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in MC3T3-E1 cells, and these may promote the proliferation of LNCaP cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that BMPs provide favorable circumstances for the survival of prostate cancer cells and the differentiation of bone stromal cells in the bone microenvironment, possibly leading to the osteoblastic metastasis of prostate cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2005772425,"Cysteamine, an anti-oxidant aminothiol, is the treatment of choice for nephropathic cystinosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease. Cysteamine is a chemo-sensitization and radioprotection agent and its antitumor effects have been investigated in various tumor cell lines and chemical induced carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated whether cysteamine has anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects in transplantable human pancreatic cancer, an aggressive metastatic disease.Cysteamine's anti-invasion effects were studied by matrigel invasion and cell migration assays in 10 pancreatic cancer cell lines. To study mechanism of action, we examined cell viability and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity in the cysteamine-treated cells. We also examined cysteamine's anti-metastasis effect in two orthotopic murine models of human pancreatic cancer by measuring peritoneal metastasis and survival of animals. Cysteamine inhibited both migration and invasion of all ten pancreatic cancer cell lines at concentrations (<25 mM) that caused no toxicity to cells. It significantly decreased MMPs activity (IC(50) 38-460 ÂµM) and zymographic gelatinase activity in a dose dependent manner in vitro and in vivo; while mRNA and protein levels of MMP-9, MMP-12 and MMP-14 were slightly increased using the highest cysteamine concentration. In vivo, cysteamine significantly decreased metastasis in two established pancreatic tumor models, although it did not affect the size of primary tumors. Additionally, cysteamine prolonged survival of mice in a dose-dependent manner without causing any toxicity. Similar to the in vitro results, MMP activity was significantly decreased in animal tumors treated with cysteamine. Cysteamine had no clinical or preclinical adverse effects in the host even at the highest dose.Our results suggest that cysteamine, an agent with a proven safety profile, may be useful for inhibition of metastasis and prolonging the survival of a host with pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2091822825,"Background In the context of a potential bioterrorist attack sensitive and fast detection of functionally active toxins such as ricin from complex matrices is necessary to be able to start timely countermeasures. One of the functional detection methods currently available for ricin is the endpoint cytotoxicity assay, which suffers from a number of technical deficits. Methodology/Findings This work describes a novel online cytotoxicity assay for the detection of active ricin and Ricinus communis agglutinin, that is based on a real-time cell electronic sensing system and impedance measurement. Characteristic growth parameters of Vero cells were monitored online and used as standardized viability control. Upon incubation with toxin the cell status and the cytotoxic effect were visualized using a characteristic cell indexâtime profile. For ricin, tested in concentrations of 0.06 ng/mL or above, a concentration-dependent decrease of cell index correlating with cytotoxicity was recorded between 3.5 h and 60 h. For ricin, sensitive detection was determined after 24 h, with an IC50 of 0.4 ng/mL (for agglutinin, an IC50 of 30 ng/mL was observed). Using functionally blocking antibodies, the specificity for ricin and agglutinin was shown. For detection from complex matrices, ricin was spiked into several food matrices, and an IC50 ranging from 5.6 to 200 ng/mL was observed. Additionally, the assay proved to be useful in detecting active ricin in environmental sample materials, as shown for organic fertilizer containing R. communis material. Conclusions/Significance The cell-electrode impedance measurement provides a sensitive online detection method for biologically active cytotoxins such as ricin. As the cell status is monitored online, the assay can be standardized more efficiently than previous approaches based on endpoint measurement. More importantly, the real-time cytotoxicity assay provides a fast and easy tool to detect active ricin in complex sample matrices."
https://openalex.org/W1981716295,"Background The acute phase response (APR) is characterized by alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism leading to an increased delivery of energy substrates. In adipocytes, there is a coordinated decrease in Free Fatty acids (FFAs) and glucose storage, in addition to an increase in FFAs mobilization. Serum Amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase protein mainly associated with High Density Lipoproteins (HDL). We hypothesized that enrichment of HDL with SAA, during the APR, could be implicated in the metabolic changes occurring in adipocytes. Methodology/Principal Findings In vitro differentiated human adipocytes (hMADS) were treated with SAA enriched HDL or recombinant SAA and the metabolic phenotype of the cells analyzed. In hMADS, SAA induces an increased lipolysis through an ERK dependent pathway. At the molecular level, SAA represses PPARÎ³2, C/EBPÎ± and SREBP-1c gene expression, three transcription factors involved in adipocyte differentiation or lipid synthesis. In addition, the activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway by SAA leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as in the case of immune cells. These latter findings were replicated in freshly isolated mature human adipocytes. Conclusions/Significance Besides its well-characterized role in cholesterol metabolism, SAA has direct metabolic effects on human adipocytes. These metabolic changes could be at least partly responsible for alterations of adipocyte metabolism observed during the APR as well as during pathophysiological conditions such as obesity and conditions leading to insulin resistant states."
https://openalex.org/W2013564453,"Background Epigenetics is defined as heritable changes in gene expression that are not based on changes in the DNA sequence. Posttranslational modification of histone proteins is a major mechanism of epigenetic regulation. The kinase PRK1 (protein kinase C related kinase 1, also known as PKN1) phosphorylates histone H3 at threonine 11 and is involved in the regulation of androgen receptor signalling. Thus, it has been identified as a novel drug target but little is known about PRK1 inhibitors and consequences of its inhibition. Methodology/Principal Finding Using a focused library screening approach, we identified the clinical candidate lestaurtinib (also known as CEP-701) as a new inhibitor of PRK1. Based on a generated 3D model of the PRK1 kinase using the homolog PKC-theta (protein kinase c theta) protein as a template, the key interaction of lestaurtinib with PRK1 was analyzed by means of molecular docking studies. Furthermore, the effects on histone H3 threonine phosphorylation and androgen-dependent gene expression was evaluated in prostate cancer cells. Conclusions/Significance Lestaurtinib inhibits PRK1 very potently in vitro and in vivo. Applied to cell culture it inhibits histone H3 threonine phosphorylation and androgen-dependent gene expression, a feature that has not been known yet. Thus our findings have implication both for understanding of the clinical activity of lestaurtinib as well as for future PRK1 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2092344319,"Prostate cancer (PCa) and colorectal cancer (CRC) are the most commonly diagnosed cancers and cancer-related causes of death in Poland. To date, numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with susceptibility to both cancer types have been identified, but their effect on disease risk may differ among populations.To identify new SNPs associated with PCa and CRC in the Polish population, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using DNA sample pools on Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays. A total of 135 PCa patients and 270 healthy men (PCa sub-study) and 525 patients with adenoma (AD), 630 patients with CRC and 690 controls (AD/CRC sub-study) were included in the analysis. Allele frequency distributions were compared with t-tests and Ï(2)-tests. Only those significantly associated SNPs with a proxy SNP (p<0.001; distance of 100 kb; r(2)>0.7) were selected. GWAS marker selection was conducted using PLINK. The study was replicated using extended cohorts of patients and controls. The association with previously reported PCa and CRC susceptibility variants was also examined. Individual patients were genotyped using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays.The GWAS selected six and 24 new candidate SNPs associated with PCa and CRC susceptibility, respectively. In the replication study, 17 of these associations were confirmed as significant in additive model of inheritance. Seven of them remained significant after correction for multiple hypothesis testing. Additionally, 17 previously reported risk variants have been identified, five of which remained significant after correction.Pooled-DNA GWAS enabled the identification of new susceptibility loci for CRC in the Polish population. Previously reported CRC and PCa predisposition variants were also identified, validating the global nature of their associations. Further independent replication studies are required to confirm significance of the newly uncovered candidate susceptibility loci."

The results showed that measles epidemics peaked approximately every 3 to 5 years with the range of measles cases detected between 56,850 and 140,048 per year. The Chinese MeV strains represented three genotypes; 1501 H1, 1 H2 and 5 A. Genotype H1 was the predominant genotype throughout China continuously circulating for at least 16 years. Genotype H1 sequences could be divided into two distinct clusters, H1a and H1b. A 4.2% average nucleotide divergence was found between the H1a and H1b clusters, and the nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid homologies of H1a viruses were 92.3%â100% and 84.7%â100%, H1b were 97.1%â100% and 95.3%â100%, respectively. Viruses from both clusters were distributed throughout China with no apparent geographic restriction and multiple co-circulating lineages were present in many provinces. Cluster H1a and H1b viruses were co-circulating during 1993 to 2005, while no H1b viruses were detected after 2005 and the transmission of that cluster has presumably been interrupted. Analysis of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid changes in the N proteins of H1a and H1b viruses showed no evidence of selective pressure. This study investigated the genotype and cluster distribution of MeV in China over a 16-year period to establish a genetic baseline before MeV elimination in Western Pacific Region (WPR). Continuous and extensive MeV surveillance and the ability to quickly identify imported cases of measles will become more critical as measles elimination goals are achieved in China in the near future. This is the first report that a single endemic genotype of measles virus has been found to be continuously circulating in one country for at least 16 years."
https://openalex.org/W2003069166,"On the basis of data in the literature, the percentages of dextral versus sinistral species of snails have been calculated for western Europe, Turkey, North America (north of Mexico), and Japan. When the family of Clausiliidae is represented, about a quarter of all snail species may be sinistral, whereas less than one per cent of the species may be sinistral where that family does not occur. The number of single-gene speciation events on the basis of chirality, resulting in the origin of mirror image species, is not closely linked to the percentage of sinistral versus dextral species in a particular region. Turkey is nevertheless exceptional by both a high percentage of sinistral species and a high number of speciation events resulting in mirror image species. Shell morphology and genetic background may influence the ease of chirality-linked speciation, whereas sinistrality may additionally be selected against by internal selection. For the Clausiliidae, the fossil record and the recent fauna suggest that successful reversals in coiling direction occurred with a frequency of once every three to four million years."
https://openalex.org/W2021243878,"Pulses of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells help maintain blood glucose in a narrow range, although the source of these pulses is unclear. It has been proposed that a positive feedback circuit exists within the glycolytic pathway, the autocatalytic activation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), which endows pancreatic beta-cells with the ability to generate oscillations in metabolism. Flux through PFK1 is controlled by the bifunctional enzyme PFK2/FBPase2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase) in two ways: via (1) production/degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru2,6-BP), a potent allosteric activator of PFK1, as well as (2) direct activation of glucokinase due to a protein-protein interaction. In this study, we used a combination of live-cell imaging and mathematical modeling to examine the effects of inducibly-expressed PFK2/FBPase2 mutants on glucose-induced Ca(2+) pulsatility in mouse islets. Irrespective of the ability to bind glucokinase, mutants of PFK2/FBPase2 that increased the kinase:phosphatase ratio reduced the period and amplitude of Ca(2+) oscillations. Mutants which reduced the kinase:phosphatase ratio had the opposite effect. These results indicate that the main effect of the bifunctional enzyme on islet pulsatility is due to Fru2,6-BP alteration of the threshold for autocatalytic activation of PFK1 by Fru1,6-BP. Using computational models based on PFK1-generated islet oscillations, we then illustrated how moderate elevation of Fru-2,6-BP can increase the frequency of glycolytic oscillations while reducing their amplitude, with sufficiently high activation resulting in termination of slow oscillations. The concordance we observed between PFK2/FBPase2-induced modulation of islet oscillations and the models of PFK1-driven oscillations furthermore suggests that metabolic oscillations, like those found in yeast and skeletal muscle, are shaped early in glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2038743662,"Altered functional neuroanatomy of high-order cognitive processing has been described in very preterm individuals (born before 33 weeks of gestation; VPT) compared to controls in childhood and adolescence. However, VPT birth may be accompanied by different types of adverse neonatal events and associated brain injury, the severity of which may have differential effects on brain development and subsequent neurodevelopmental outcome. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to investigate how differing degrees of neonatal brain injury, detected by neonatal ultrasounds, affect the functional neuroanatomy of memory processing in VPT young adults. We used a verbal paired associates learning task, consisting of four encoding, four cued-recall and four baseline condition blocks. To further investigate whether differences in neural activation between the groups were modulated by structural brain changes, structural MRI data were also collected. We studied 12 VPT young adults with a history of periventricular haemorrhage with associated ventricular dilatation, 17 VPT individuals with a history of uncomplicated periventricular haemorrhage, 12 individuals with normal ultrasonographic findings, and 17 controls. Results of a linear trend analysis demonstrated that during completion of the paired associates learning task right frontal and right parietal brain activation decreased as the severity of neonatal brain injury increased. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in on-line task performance and participants' intelligence quotient (IQ) at assessment. This pattern of differential activation across the groups was observed particularly in the right middle frontal gyrus during encoding and in the right posterior cingulate gyrus during recall. Structural MRI data analysis revealed that grey matter volume in the right superior temporal gyrus, right cerebellum, left middle temporal gyrus, right globus pallidus and right medial frontal gyrus decreased with increasing severity of neonatal brain injury. However, the significant between-group functional neuroanatomical differences were not directly attributable to the detected structural regional differences."
https://openalex.org/W2054555545,"Trioecy is an uncommon sexual system in which males, females, and hermaphrodites co-occur as three clearly different gender classes. The evolutionary stability of trioecy is unclear, but would depend on factors such as hermaphroditic sex allocation and rates of outcrossing vs. selfing. Here, trioecious populations of Mercurialis annua are described for the first time. We examined the frequencies of females, males and hermaphrodites across ten natural populations and evaluated the association between the frequency of females and plant densities. Previous studies have shown that selfing rates in this species are density-dependent and are reduced in the presence of males, which produce substantially more pollen than hermaphrodites. Accordingly, we examined the evolutionary stability of trioecy using an experiment in which we (a) indirectly manipulated selfing rates by altering plant densities and the frequency of males in a fully factorial manner across 20 experimental plots and (b) examined the effect of these manipulations on the frequency of the three sex phenotypes in the next generation of plants. In the parental generation, we measured the seed and pollen allocations of hermaphrodites and compared them with allocations by unisexual plants. In natural populations, females occurred at higher frequencies in denser patches, a finding consistent with our expectations. Under our experimental conditions, however, no combination of plant densities and male frequencies was associated with increased frequencies of females. Our results suggest that the factors that regulate female frequencies in trioecious populations of M. annua are independent of those regulating male frequencies (density), and that the stable co-existence of all three sex phenotypes within populations is unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W2092458899,"The goal of the current study was to determine whether the sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1)/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway is involved in myogenic vasoconstriction under normal physiological conditions. In the present study, we assessed whether endogenous S1P generated by pressure participates in myogenic vasoconstriction and which signaling pathways are involved in SK1/S1P-induced myogenic response under normal physiological conditions.We measured pressure-induced myogenic response, Ca(2+) concentration, and 20 kDa myosin light chain phosphorylation (MLC(20)) in rabbit posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs). SK1 was expressed and activated by elevated transmural pressure in rabbit PCAs. Translocation of SK1 by pressure elevation was blocked in the absence of external Ca(2+) and in the presence of mechanosensitive ion channel and voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel blockers. Pressure-induced myogenic tone was inhibited in rabbit PCAs treated with sphingosine kinase inhibitor (SKI), but was augmented by treatment with NaF, which is an inhibitor of sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphohydrolase. Exogenous S1P further augmented pressure-induced myogenic responses. Pressure induced an increase in Ca(2+) concentration leading to the development of myogenic tone, which was inhibited by SKI. Exogenous S1P further increased the pressure-induced increased Ca(2+) concentration and myogenic tone, but SKI had no effect. Pressure- and exogenous S1P-induced myogenic tone was inhibited by pre-treatment with the Rho kinase inhibitor and NADPH oxidase inhibitors. Pressure- and exogenous S1P-induced myogenic tone were inhibited by pre-treatment with S1P receptor blockers, W146 (S1P1), JTE013 (S1P2), and CAY10444 (S1P3). MLC(20) phosphorylation was increased when the transmural pressure was raised from 40 to 80 mmHg and exogenous S1P further increased MLC(20) phosphorylation. The pressure-induced increase of MLC(20) phosphorylation was inhibited by pre-treatment of arteries with SKI.Our results suggest that the SK1/S1P pathway may play an important role in pressure-induced myogenic responses in rabbit PCAs under normal physiological conditions."

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of such a diagnostic test, MRI+CLP (contrastophore-linker-pharmacophore), should it become clinically available.We compared the cost-effectiveness of MRI+CLP to that of standard diagnosis using currently available cognition tests and of standard MRI, and investigated the impact of a hypothetical treatment efficient in early AD. The primary analysis was based on the current French context for 70-year-old patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). In alternative ""screen and treat"" scenarios, we analyzed the consequences of systematic screenings of over-60 individuals (either population-wide or restricted to the ApoE4 genotype population). We used a Markov model of AD progression; model parameters, as well as incurred costs and quality-of-life weights in France were taken from the literature. We performed univariate and probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analyses. The base-case preferred strategy was the standard MRI diagnosis strategy. In the primary analysis however, MRI+CLP could become the preferred strategy under a wide array of scenarios involving lower cost and/or higher sensitivity or specificity. By contrast, in the ""screen and treat"" analyses, the probability of MRI+CLP becoming the preferred strategy remained lower than 5%.It is thought that anti-beta-amyloid compounds might halt the development of dementia in early stage patients. This study suggests that, even should such treatments become available, systematically screening the over-60 population for AD would only become cost-effective with highly specific tests able to diagnose early stages of the disease. However, offering a new diagnostic test based on beta-amyloid markers to elderly patients with MCI might prove cost-effective."

The results of tandem affinity purification suggested that trypanosome CTR9 associates with homologues of Leo1 and Cdc73; genes encoding homologues of Rtf1 and Paf1 were not found. RNAi targeting CTR9 resulted in at least ten-fold decreases in 131 essential mRNAs: they included several that are required for gene expression and its control, such as those encoding subunits of RNA polymerases, exoribonucleases that target mRNA, RNA helicases and RNA-binding proteins. Simultaneously, some genes from regions subject to chromatin silencing were derepressed, possibly as a secondary effect of the loss of two proteins that are required for silencing, ISWI and NLP1."

This work addresses the acute and long-term effects of hyperthermia in the highly metastatic melanoma cell line B16-F10.Melanoma cells were submitted to one heat treatment, 45Â°C for 30 min, and thereafter were kept at 37Â°C for an additional period of 14 days. Cultures maintained at 37Â°C were used as control. Cultures were assessed for the heat shock reaction.Immediately after the heat shock, cells began a process of fast degradation, and, in the first 24 h, cultures showed decreased viability, alterations in cell morphology and F-actin cytoskeleton organization, significant reduction in the number of adherent cells, most of them in a process of late apoptosis, and an altered gene expression profile. A follow-up of two weeks after heat exposure showed that viability and number of adherent cells remained very low, with a high percentage of early apoptotic cells. Still, heat-treated cultures maintained a low but relatively constant population of cells in S and G(2)/M phases for a long period after heat exposure, evidencing the presence of metabolically active cells.The melanoma cell line B16-F10 is susceptible to one hyperthermia treatment at 45Â°C, with significant induced acute and long-term effects.

https://openalex.org/W1967216344,"The longitudinal relationship between central plastic changes and clinical presentations of peripheral hearing impairment remains unknown. Previously, we reported a unique plastic pattern of âhealthy-side dominanceâ in acute unilateral idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL). This study aimed to explore whether such hemispheric asymmetry bears any prognostic relevance to ISSNHL along the disease course. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), inter-hemispheric differences in peak dipole amplitude and latency of N100m to monaural tones were evaluated in 21 controls and 21 ISSNHL patients at two stages: initial and fixed stage (1 month later). Dynamics/Prognostication of hemispheric asymmetry were assessed by the interplay between hearing level/hearing gain and ipsilateral/contralateral ratio (I/C) of N100m latency and amplitude. Healthy-side dominance of N100m amplitude was observed in ISSNHL initially. The pattern changed with disease process. There is a strong correlation between the hearing level at the fixed stage and initial I/Camplitude on affected-ear stimulation in ISSNHL. The optimal cut-off value with the best prognostication effect for the hearing improvement at the fixed stage was an initial I/Clatency on affected-ear stimulation of 1.34 (between subgroups of complete and partial recovery) and an initial I/Clatency on healthy-ear stimulation of 0.76 (between subgroups of partial and no recovery), respectively. This study suggested that a dynamic process of central auditory plasticity can be induced by peripheral lesions. The hemispheric asymmetry at the initial stage bears an excellent prognostic potential for the treatment outcomes and hearing level at the fixed stage in ISSNHL. Our study demonstrated that such brain signature of central auditory plasticity in terms of both N100m latency and amplitude at defined time can serve as a prognostication predictor for ISSNHL. Further studies are needed to explore the long-term temporal scenario of auditory hemispheric asymmetry and to get better psychoacoustic correlates of pathological hemispheric asymmetry in ISSNHL."

Malnutrition outcomes were defined as body mass index (BMI), Fat-free mass index (FFMI) and Fat mass index (FMI). Separate linear predictive models including albumin were fit to these outcomes in HIV negative and HIV positive women by CD4 strata (CD4>350,200â350 and <200 cells/Âµl). Results In unadjusted models for each outcome in HIV-negative and HIV positive women with CD4>350 cells/Âµl, serum albumin was not significantly associated with BMI, FFMI or FMI. Albumin was significantly associated with all three outcomes (p<0.05) in HIV+ women with CD4 200â350 cells/Âµl, and highly significant in HIV+ women with CD4<200 cells/Âµl (P<0.001). In multivariable linear regression, albumin remained associated with FFMI in women with CD4 count<200 cells/Âµl (p<0.01) but not in HIV+ women with CD4>200. Discussion While serum albumin is widely used to indicate nutritional status it did not consistently predict malnutrition outcomes in HIV- women or HIV+ women with higher CD4. This result suggests that albumin may measure end stage disease as well as malnutrition and should not be used as a proxy for nutritional status without further study of its association with validated measures."
https://openalex.org/W2056617304,"The commonly recognized mechanisms for spatial regulation inside the cell are membrane-bounded compartmentalization and biochemical association with subcellular organelles. We use computational modeling to investigate another spatial regulation mechanism mediated by the microtubule network in the cell. Our results demonstrate that the mitotic spindle can impose strong sequestration and concentration effects on molecules with binding affinity for microtubules, especially dynein-directed cargoes. The model can recapitulate the essence of three experimental observations on distinct microtubule network morphologies: the sequestration of germ plasm components by the mitotic spindles in the Drosophila syncytial embryo, the asymmetric cell division initiated by the time delay in centrosome maturation in the Drosophila neuroblast, and the diffusional block between neighboring energids in the Drosophila syncytial embryo. Our model thus suggests that the cell cycle-dependent changes in the microtubule network are critical for achieving different spatial regulation effects. The microtubule network provides a spatially extensive docking platform for molecules and gives rise to a âstructured cytoplasmâ, in contrast to a free and fluid environment."
https://openalex.org/W1975499443,"Studies on human fertility genes have identified numerous risk/protective alleles involved in the occurrence of reproductive system diseases causing infertility or subfertility. Investigations we carried out in populations at natural fertility seem to suggest that the clinical relevance that some fertility genes are now acquiring depends on their interaction with contemporary reproductive behaviors (birth control, delayed childbearing, and spacing birth order, among others). In recent years, a new physiological role in human fertility regulation has emerged for the tumor- suppressor p53 gene (P53), and the P53 Arg72Pro polymorphism has been associated with recurrent implantation failure in humans. To lend support to our previous observations, we examined the impact of Arg72Pro polymorphism on fertility in two samples of Italian women not selected for impaired fertility but collected from populations with different (premodern and modern) reproductive behaviors. Among the women at near-natural fertility (n = 98), the P53 genotypes were not associated with different reproductive efficiency, whereas among those with modern reproductive behaviors (n = 68), the P53 genotypes were associated with different mean numbers of children [Pro/Pro = 0.75<Pro/Arg = 1.7<Arg/Arg = 2, (p = 0.056)] and a significant negative relationship between the number of children and P53 Pro allele frequencies (p = 0.028) was observed. These results are consistent with those of clinical studies reporting an association between the P53 Pro allele and recurrent implantation failure. By combining these findings with previous ones, we suggest here that some common variants of fertility genes may have become ""detrimental"" following exposure to modern reproductive patterns and might therefore be associated with reduced reproductive success. Set within an evolutionary framework, this change could lead to the selection of a set of gene variants fitter to current reproductive behaviors as the shift to later child-bearing age in developed countries."
https://openalex.org/W2023200299,"Background It has been extensively developed in recent years that cell-permeable small molecules, such as polyamide, can be programmed to disrupt transcription factor-DNA interfaces and can silence aberrant gene expression. For example, cyclic pyrrole-imidazole polyamide that competes with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) for binding to glucocorticoid response elements could be expected to affect the DNA dependent binding by interfering with the protein-DNA interface. However, how such small molecules affect the transcription factor-DNA interfaces and gene regulatory pathways through DNA structure distortion is not fully understood so far. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present work, we have constructed some models, especially the ternary model of polyamides+DNA+GR DNA-binding domain (GRDBD) dimer, and carried out molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations for them to address how polyamide molecules disrupt the GRDBD and DNA interface when polyamide and protein bind at the same sites on opposite grooves of DNA. Conclusions/Significance We found that the cyclic polyamide binding in minor groove of DNA can induce a large structural perturbation of DNA, i.e. a >4 Ã widening of the DNA minor groove and a compression of the major groove by more than 4 Ã as compared with the DNA molecule in the GRDBD dimer+DNA complex. Further investigations for the ternary system of polyamides+DNA+GRDBD dimer and the binary system of allosteric DNA+GRDBD dimer revealed that the compression of DNA major groove surface causes GRDBD to move away from the DNA major groove with the initial average distance of â¼4 Ã to the final average distance of â¼10 Ã during 40 ns simulation course. Therefore, this study straightforward explores how small molecule targeting specific sites in the DNA minor groove disrupts the transcription factor-DNA interface in DNA major groove, and consequently modulates gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2014024181,"Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) terminate glutamatergic synaptic transmission by removing glutamate from the synaptic cleft into neuronal and glial cells. EAATs are not only secondary active glutamate transporters but also function as anion channels. Gating of EAAT anion channels is tightly coupled to transitions within the glutamate uptake cycle, resulting in Na(+)- and glutamate-dependent anion currents. A point mutation neutralizing a conserved aspartic acid within the intracellular loop close to the end of transmembrane domain 2 was recently shown to modify the substrate dependence of EAAT anion currents. To distinguish whether this mutation affects transitions within the uptake cycle or directly modifies the opening/closing of the anion channel, we used voltage clamp fluorometry. Using three different sites for fluorophore attachment, V120C, M205C, and A430C, we observed time-, voltage-, and substrate-dependent alterations of EAAT3 fluorescence intensities. The voltage and substrate dependence of fluorescence intensities can be described by a 15-state model of the transport cycle in which several states are connected to branching anion channel states. D83A-mediated changes of fluorescence intensities, anion currents, and secondary active transport can be explained by exclusive modifications of substrate translocation rates. In contrast, sole modification of anion channel opening and closing is insufficient to account for all experimental data. We conclude that D83A has direct effects on the glutamate transport cycle and that these effects result in changed anion channel function."
https://openalex.org/W2061032265,"Background HIV prevention trials are increasingly being conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Women at risk for HIV are also at risk of pregnancy. To maximize safety, women agree to avoid pregnancy during trials, yet pregnancies occur. Using data from the HVTN 503/âPhambiliâ vaccine trial, we report pregnancy incidence during and after the vaccination period and identify factors, measured at screening, associated with incident pregnancy. Methods To enrol in the trial, women agreed and were supported to avoid pregnancy until 1 month after their third and final vaccination (âvaccination periodâ), corresponding to the first 7 months of follow-up. Unsterilized women, pooled across study arms, were analyzed. Poisson regression compared pregnancy rates during and after the vaccination period. Cox proportional hazards regression identified associations with first pregnancy. Results Among 352 women (median age 23 yrs; median follow-up 1.5 yrs), pregnancy incidence was 9.6/100 women-years overall and 6.8/100 w-yrs and 11.3/100 w-yrs during and after the vaccination period, respectively [Rate Ratio = 0.60 (0.32â1.14), p = 0.10]. In multivariable analysis, pregnancy was reduced among women who: enrolled at sites providing contraception on-site [HR = 0.43, 95% CI (0.22â0.86)]; entered the trial as injectable contraceptive users [HR = 0.37 (0.21â0.67)] or as consistent condom users (trend) [HR = 0.54 (0.28â1.04)]. Compared with women with a single partner of HIV-unknown status, pregnancy rates were increased among women with: a single partner whose status was HIV-negative [HR = 2.34(1.16â4.73)] and; 2 partners both of HIV-unknown status [HR = 4.42(1.59â12.29)]. Women with 2 more of these risk factors: marijuana use, heavy drinking, or use of either during sex, had increased pregnancy incidence [HR = 2.66 (1.24â5.72)]. Conclusions It is possible to screen South African women for pregnancy risk at trial entry. Providing injectable contraception for free on-site and supporting consistent condom use may reduce incident pregnancy. Screening should determine the substance use, partnering, and HIV status of both members of the couple for both pregnancy and HIV prevention.

https://openalex.org/W2061422947,"HSP90 chaperones a large number of proteins, and it plays essential roles in multiple signaling pathways to maintain protein homeostasis in the cytosol. In addition, HSP90 has been implicated in mediating recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, no pharmacologic agents have been developed to interrogate this pathway. Herein we demonstrate that a peptide-based inhibitor that was previously reported to inhibit the master Toll-like receptor-chaperone gp96, an endoplasmic reticulum paralog of HSP90, in fact blocks HSP90-LPS interaction. It inhibited the binding of LPS to the cell surface of both wild type and gp96-null cells and thereby abrogated the cellular response to LPS but not to other Toll-like receptor ligands. We also generated a series of peptide derivatives (named peptide inhibitors of endotoxin responsiveness (PIERs)) from the N-terminal helix structure of HSP90 and demonstrated their effectiveness in blocking LPS activity.

Prodromou C. Structure and mechanism of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone machinery.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 271-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic form of HSP90 includes HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1, also known as HSPC1 and HSPC3, respectively (2Kampinga H.H. Hageman J. Vos M.J. Kubota H. Tanguay R.M. Bruford E.A. Cheetham M.E. Chen B. Hightower L.E. Guidelines for the nomenclature of the human heat shock proteins.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2009; 14: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Several paralogs of HSP90 exist in other cellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum gp96 (also known as grp94 and HSPC4) and mitochondrion TRAP-1 (HSPC5). Cytosolic HSP90 chaperones a large number of clients, and it is essential for organism survival as demonstrated with yeast. As a member of the GHKL (gyrase, HSP90, histidine kinases, and MutL) superfamily, HSP90 adopts a âVâ-shaped parallel homodimer structure (3Ali M.M. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Meyer P. Panaretou B.

The ATPase activity is conserved among all its orthologs and paralogs and is critical for its role as a molecular chaperone.

LPS or endotoxin is one of the most potent microbial products that can stimulate robust host inflammatory responses (4Beutler B. Rietschel E.T. Innate immune sensing and its roots: the story of endotoxin.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Study of a spontaneous LPS-resistant C3H/HeJ mouse strain led to the discovery of TLR4 as the receptor for LPS (5Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Defective LPS signaling in C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice: mutations in Tlr4 gene.Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6422) Google Scholar). The dimer of TLR4 forms a complex with two MD-2 molecules (6Kim H.M. Park B.S. Kim J.I. Kim S.E. Lee J. Oh S.C. Enkhbayar P. Matsushima N. Lee H. Yoo O.J. Lee J.O. Crystal structure of the TLR4-MD-2 complex with bound endotoxin antagonist Eritoran.Cell. 2007; 130: 906-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The binding of LPS by MD-2 brings the two protomers of TLR4 together, triggering conformational changes in the cytoplasmic toll/interleukin 1 receptor domains of TLR4 to activate downstream signaling. TLR4 is the only TLR that utilizes all four known adaptors, MyD88, toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adapter-inducing interferon-Î², TRIF-related adaptor molecule and toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (7Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. The adaptor molecule TIRAP provides signalling specificity for Toll-like receptors.Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 8Kawai T. Akira S. Toll-like receptors and their crosstalk with other innate receptors in infection and immunity.Immunity. 2011; 34: 637-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). The signaling of TLR4 is regulated spatially and temporarily. LPS binds to TLR4Â·MD-2 complex on the cell surface, and the complex then engages and MyD88 to initiate the proinflammatory pathway. LPS-bound TLR4Â·MD-2 complex can also be endocytosed and transported into the endolysosome compartment (9Kagan J.C. Su T. Horng T. Chow A. Akira S. Medzhitov R. TRAM couples endocytosis of Toll-like receptor 4 to the induction of interferon-Î².Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). It is in the endolysosome that toll/interleukin 1 receptor domains of TLR4 binds to TRIF-related adaptor molecule and toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-Î², initiating the late NFÎºB signaling. This event in the endolysosome also triggers signaling of interferon regulatory factor pathways, leading to the production of type I IFNs (10Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Phosphoinositide-mediated adaptor recruitment controls Toll-like receptor signaling.Cell. 2006; 125: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Two other molecules, LPS-binding protein and CD14, are known to play important roles in LPS binding. LPS-binding protein is a soluble protein that helps to extract LPS from Gram-negative bacterial cell walls (11Tobias P.S. Mathison J.C. Ulevitch R.J. A family of lipopolysaccharide binding proteins involved in responses to Gram-negative sepsis.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13479-13481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mostly expressed as a membrane bound form on cells of myeloid lineages, CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein (12Gupta D. Kirkland T.N. Viriyakosol S. Dziarski R. CD14 is a cell-activating receptor for bacterial peptidoglycan.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Without a signaling tail, CD14 functions as a co-receptor by transferring LPS from LPS-binding protein to TLR4Â·MD-2 complex. However, additional molecules other than CD14 might act as co-receptors for TLR4. The earliest evidence for the involvement of HSP90 came from the LPS-like molecule Taxol, which induces TNFÎ± in mouse macrophages (13Byrd C.A. Bornmann W. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Pavletich N. Rosen N. Nathan C.F. Ding A. Heat shock protein 90 mediates macrophage activation by Taxol and bacterial lipopolysaccharide.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 5645-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It was found that HSP70 and HSP90 were the two major Taxol-binding proteins. The role of HSP70 and HSP90 was further suggested by their direct binding to LPS and the indirect evidence of interaction between HSP70Â·HSP90 and LPS through fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies (14Triantafilou K. Triantafilou M. Ladha S. Mackie A. Dedrick R.L. Fernandez N. Cherry R.

Immunol. 2001; 62: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Later on, it was shown that HSP70 and HSP90 function in a complex that also includes CXCR4 and growth differentiation factor 5 (17Triantafilou M. Triantafilou K. Heat-shock protein 70 and heat-shock protein 90 associate with Toll-like receptor 4 in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As an endoplasmic reticulum paralog of HSP90, gp96 is the master chaperone for TLRs (18Randow F. Seed B. Endoplasmic reticulum chaperone gp96 is required for innate immunity but not cell viability.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 19Yang Y. Liu B. Dai J.

With the exception of TLR3, the rest of the TLRs are exclusively dependent on gp96 for folding and functional expression despite the abundance of other HSPs in the endoplasmic reticulum (21Liu B. Yang Y. Qiu Z. Staron M. Hong F. Li Y. Wu S. Li Y. Hao B. Bona R. Han D. Li Z. Folding of Toll-like receptors by the HSP90 paralogue gp96 requires a substrate-specific cochaperone.Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Overexpression of gp96 causes lupus-like diseases in a manner that is dependent on TLR4 (22Liu B. Dai J. Zheng H. Stoilova D. Sun S. Li Z. Cell surface expression of an endoplasmic reticulum resident heat shock protein gp96 triggers MyD88-dependent systemic autoimmune diseases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15824-15829Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Liu B. Yang Y. Dai J. Medzhitov R. Freudenberg M.A. Zhang P.L. Li Z. TLR4 up-regulation at protein or gene level is pathogenic for lupus-like autoimmune disease.J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6880-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). On the other hand, deletion of gp96 from the macrophage compartment leads to LPS resistance (19Yang Y. Liu B. Dai J. Srivastava P.K. Zammit D.J. LefranÃ§ois L. Li Z. Heat shock protein gp96 is a master chaperone for toll-like receptors and is important in the innate function of macrophages.Immunity. 2007; 26: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Therefore, gp96 appears to be an attractive drug target for inflammation, sepsis, and autoimmune disease. In a recent study utilizing in silico methods, a peptide inhibitor of gp96 was designed by targeting the N-terminal helix-loop-helix sequence, and the authors demonstrated that this peptide could effectively inhibit LPS responses both in vitro and in vivo (24Kliger Y. Levy O. Oren A. Ashkenazy H. Tiran Z. Novik A. Rosenberg A. Amir A. Wool A. Toporik A. Schreiber E. Eshel D. Levine Z. Cohen Y. Nold-Petry C. Dinarello C.A. Borukhov I.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism of action was that this peptide mimics the sequence of the helix, therefore disrupting the helix-helix interaction and the chaperoning function of gp96. However, based on the crystal structure of gp96 (25Dollins D.E. Warren J.J. Immormino R.M. Gewirth D.T. Structures of GRP94-nucleotide complexes reveal mechanistic differences between the hsp90 chaperones.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 41-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), this N-terminal helix structure is unlikely to be a substrate-binding site. In addition, the inhibitory effect of this peptide has a very rapid kinetics, arguing against its roles in inhibiting gp96-mediated TLR folding as the mechanism of its action. In the current study, we demonstrate that N-terminal helix-based peptides from both HSP90 and gp96 are able to inhibit LPS binding to HSP90 and to attenuate LPS-mediated NFÎºB signaling in a manner that is independent of their activity against gp96. THP-1 and SKBR3 cell lines were obtained from ATCC. Wild type or gp96 KO mutant pre-B cell lines were kind gifts from B. Seed and were described previously (18Randow F. Seed B.

For cell surface staining, a single cell suspension of live cells was obtained and washed in FACS buffer twice. Fc receptor blocking with or without serum was performed depending on the individual primary antibody used for staining. Primary and secondary antibody staining was performed stepwise with FACS buffer washing in between. Propidium iodide was added right before FACS instrumentation to gate out dead cells. For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were stimulated in the presence of 10 Î¼g/ml brefeldin A before harvesting and washing with FACS buffer. Cell permeabilization was done with 0.25% saponin in FACS buffer. The same buffer was used in subsequent steps including blocking, washing, and antibody staining. The last washing step before FACS instrumentation was done with FACS buffer alone without detergent. Stained cells were acquired on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Purified HSP90 (1 Î¼g) was incubated on ice in the presence of biotin-LPS (2 Î¼g/ml) and/or PIER1 peptide (5 Î¼m) at 4 Â°C for 30 min. The mixture was then incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads at 4 Â°C overnight. Beads were then washed with Tris lysis buffer and subjected to boiling in SDS loading buffer for 5 min prior to resolving by SDS-PAGE. The intensity of Western blot bands was quantified by ImageJ software. Biotin-LPS stock (500 Î¼g/ml) was diluted in complete RPMI 1640 medium to the desired working concentration. About 0.2 million cells were resuspended in 50 Î¼l of medium/well in a 96-well plate. Another 50 Î¼l of biotin-LPS suspension was added into the same well. The plate was then placed on a gentle shaker and rocked at 37 Â°C for 30 min. After the incubation, cells were harvested from the well into cold PBS, washed with PBS and FACS buffer, and stained with streptavidin-allophycocyanin antibody at 4 Â°C for 30 min. Samples were then thoroughly washed with FACS buffer and analyzed on a FACSCalibur. We synthesized a 37-mer peptide corresponding to residues 444â480 of gp96 based on the study by Kliger et al. (24Kliger Y. Levy O. Oren A. Ashkenazy H. Tiran Z. Novik A. Rosenberg A. Amir A. Wool A. Toporik A. Schreiber E. Eshel D. Levine Z. Cohen Y. Nold-Petry C. Dinarello C.A. Borukhov I.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For consistency in this study, we named this peptide PIER1. We tested PIER1 activity using a murine pre-B cell line that stably expresses the NFÎºB-GFP reporter. When stimulated with LPS for 16â18 h, the untreated pre-B cell line had a dose-dependent induction of NFÎºB-GFP (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the Kliger et al. (24Kliger Y. Levy O. Oren A.

Liu B. Dai J. Srivastava P.K. Zammit D.J. LefranÃ§ois L. Li Z.

Commun. 2010; 1: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Inhibition of gp96 affects the de novo TLR biogenesis, but it is not expected to affect the preexisting mature TLRs, which argues against gp96 being the target of PIER1. To further address this possibility, we also examined the effect of PIER1 on TLR2 and TLR9 signaling using Pam3CSK4 and CpG, respectively. The folding and assembly of both TLR2 and TLR9 are dependent on gp96 in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen before transport to the cell surface and endolysosome, respectively. If PIER1-mediated suppression of LPS responsiveness were via inhibition of the chaperone function of gp96, we would also expect significant inhibition of TLR2 and TLR9 function. Contrary to this prediction, we found that PIER1 had no activity against NFÎºB activation induced by TLR2 or TLR9 ligands. Therefore, we conclude that PIER1 inhibit LPS responsiveness in a gp96-independent manner. We next examined the effect of PIER1 on LPS binding to the cell surface. Given the fact that PIER1 inhibition does not require preincubation of cells before adding LPS, we hypothesized that the inhibitory effect of PIER1 is at the upstream level of the LPS response, i.e. the binding of LPS to the TLR4Â·MD-2 complex. This consideration is also consistent with the fact that PIER1 is not expected to enter cells readily. We performed a standard LPS binding assay with biotinylated LPS followed by streptavidin-conjugated FITC to detect bound LPS on the cell surface (Fig. 2). Strikingly, we found that LPS was able to bind to both WT and gp96-null pre-B cells, and this binding was significantly inhibited by PIER1 (Fig. 3). Because gp96 mutant pre-B cells do not express cell surface gp96, TLR4Â·MD-2, or CD14 (18Randow F. Seed B.

Additionally, a sequence alignment between HSP90 and gp96 of both human and mouse origin demonstrated that the target sequence of PIER1 peptide is highly conserved, especially in the first half of the HSP90 sequence. We performed a direct binding assay by incubating purified HSP90 with biotin-LPS in the presence or absence of PIER1. After a 30-min incubation period, we pulled down the HSP90Â·LPS complex with streptavidin beads followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. We found that HSP90 could directly bind to LPS, and this binding was significantly inhibited by 5 Î¼m PIER1 (Fig. 4). As proposed by the Kliger et al. (24Kliger Y. Levy O. Oren A. Ashkenazy H.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) study, the design of PIER1 peptide is based on a potential helix-helix interaction between PIER1 and the target sequence in the HSP that requires a conformation-dependent interaction. To examine this possibility, we designed another peptide, PIER2, by substituting the middle two residues in the helix of PIER1, Val and Arg, with two Pro residues. We hypothesized that the inflexible backbone of two Pro residues will kink the helix-loop-helix structure of PIER1 peptide, therefore abolishing its inhibitory effect. In addition, we designed PIER3 peptide based on the target region of HSP90 (Fig. 5A). We tested the efficacy of these two peptides in the same murine pre-B cell line as described earlier. As predicted, PIER3 was equally effective in inhibiting LPS-mediated NFÎºB-GFP activation. Introduction of Pro to PIER1 (PIER2) completely abolished the inhibitory effect of PIER1 (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that PIER inhibits LPS responsiveness by blocking LPS binding in a conformation-dependent manner. To further determine the roles of cell surface HSP90 in LPS signaling, we took advantage of a well characterized cell-impermeable HSP90 inhibitor, dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin-N-oxide (27Tsutsumi S.

Findings indicate adequate levels of DHT are essential for prostate growth, development, and differentiation, and elevated levels are associated with prostate diseases. Insufficient DHT levels cause developmental defects in the prostate, and conditions that lead to abnormally high DHT levels cause serious virilization syndromes, indicating that regulation of DHT levels is essential. To initiate prostate organogenesis, the urogenital sinus mesenchyme and urogenital sinus epithelium interact upon receiving signals from DHT-occupied androgen receptors in urogenital sinus mesenchyme/stromal cells, giving rise to basal and luminal epithelia (2Cunha G.R.

Moreover, the presence of 5Î±-steroid reductase 2 (5Î±-SR-2) primarily in luminal cells (7Pelletier G. Expression of steroidogenic enzymes and sex steroid receptors in human prostate.Best Pract. Res.

The DHT-occupied androgen receptor in luminal cells mediates all prostate-specific functions. The importance of testosterone reduction to DHT by 5Î±-SR-2 has been confirmed by malformation of prostate external genitalia during development due to type 2 enzyme deficiencies or in animals treated with 5Î±-SR-2 inhibitors (1Russell D.W. Wilson J.D. Steroid 5Î±-reductase: two genes/two enzymes.Annu. Rev.

For the first time, studies have described an alternative DHT biosynthetic pathway that bypasses testosterone in prostate cell lines (9Luu-The V. Assessment of steroidogenic pathways that do not require testosterone as intermediate.Horm. Mol. Biol. Clin. Invest. 2011; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and intratumoral prostate tissues (10Chang K.H. Li R. Papari-Zareei M. Watumull L. Zhao Y.D. Auchus R.J. Sharifi N.

Because 4-androstenedione derived from DHEA can be reduced at the 17-keto position to testosterone by a 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase or at the 5Î±-position to 5Î±-androstanedione by a 5Î±-SR, two consecutive reductive steps starting with 5Î±-androstanedione reduction by 5Î±-SR-1 over 5Î±-SR-2 and 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase generate DHT (see Fig. 1B). Analyses of intratumoral prostate tissues that ranged from hormone-naÃ¯ve prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer revealed that the level of 5Î±-SR-1 increased as 5Î±-SR-2 decreased, indicating that 5Î±-SR-1 becomes the dominant enzyme that controls the development of the alternative pathway (10Chang K.H.

This finding strongly indicates that the emergence of this alternative pathway is causative in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (9Luu-The V.

https://openalex.org/W2037367597,"Cell-mediated transgenesis, based on somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), provides the opportunity to shape the genetic make-up of cattle. Bovine primary fetal fibroblasts, commonly used cells for SCNT, have a limited lifespan, and complex genetic modifications that require sequential transfections can be challenging time and cost-wise. To overcome these limitations, SCNT is frequently used to rejuvenate the cell lines and restore exhausted growth potential. We have designed a construct to be used in a 2-step cassette exchange experiment. Our transgene contains a puromycin resistance marker gene and an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) expression cassette, both driven by a strong mammalian promoter, and flanked by loxP sites and sequences from the bovine Î²-casein locus. Several transgenic cell lines were generated by random insertion into primary bovine cell lines. Two of these original cell lines were rederived by SCNT and new primary cells, with the same genetic makeup as the original donors, were established. While the original cell lines were puromycin-resistant and had a characteristic EGFP expression profile, all rejuvenated cell lines were sensitive to puromycin, and displayed varied EGFP expression, indicative of various degrees of silencing. When the methylation states of individual CpG sites within the transgene were analyzed, a striking increase in transgene-specific methylation was observed in all rederived cell lines. The results indicate that original transgenic donor cells and their rejuvenated derivatives may not be equivalent and differ in the functionality of their transgene sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2116023619,"Livestock movements in Great Britain are well recorded, have been extensively analysed with respect to their role in disease spread, and have been used in real time to advise governments on the control of infectious diseases. Typically, livestock holdings are treated as distinct entities that must observe movement standstills upon receipt of livestock, and must report livestock movements. However, there are currently two dispensations that can exempt holdings from either observing standstills or reporting movements, namely the Sole Occupancy Authority (SOA) and Cattle Tracing System (CTS) Links, respectively. In this report we have used a combination of data analyses and computational modelling to investigate the usage and potential impact of such linked holdings on the size of a Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) epidemic. Our analyses show that although SOAs are abundant, their dynamics appear relatively stagnant. The number of CTS Links is also abundant, and increasing rapidly. Although most linked holdings are only involved in a single CTS Link, some holdings are involved in numerous links that can be amalgamated to form ""CTS Chains"" which can be both large and geographically dispersed. Our model predicts that under a worst case scenario of ""one infected - all infected"", SOAs do pose a risk of increasing the size (in terms of number of infected holdings) of a FMD epidemic, but this increase is mainly due to intra-SOA infection spread events. Furthermore, although SOAs do increase the geographic spread of an epidemic, this increase is predominantly local. Whereas, CTS Chains pose a risk of increasing both the size and the geographical spread of the disease substantially, under a worse case scenario. Our results highlight the need for further investigations into whether CTS Chains are transmission chains, and also investigations into intra-SOA movements and livestock distributions due to the lack of current data."
https://openalex.org/W2075556715,"Background The optimal structure of an internal medicine ward team at a teaching hospital is unknown. We hypothesized that increasing the ratio of attendings to housestaff would result in an enhanced perceived educational experience for residents. Methods Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (HUMC) is a tertiary care, public hospital in Los Angeles County. Standard ward teams at HUMC, with a housestaffâ¶attending ratio of 5â¶1, were split by adding one attending and then dividing the teams into two experimental teams containing ratios of 3â¶1 and 2â¶1. Web-based Likert satisfaction surveys were completed by housestaff and attending physicians on the experimental and control teams at the end of their rotations, and objective healthcare outcomes (e.g., length of stay, hospital readmission, mortality) were compared. Results Nine hundred and ninety patients were admitted to the standard control teams and 184 were admitted to the experimental teams (81 to the one-intern team and 103 to the two-intern team). Patients admitted to the experimental and control teams had similar age and disease severity. Residents and attending physicians consistently indicated that the quality of the educational experience, time spent teaching, time devoted to patient care, and quality of life were superior on the experimental teams. Objective healthcare outcomes did not differ between experimental and control teams. Conclusions Altering internal medicine ward team structure to reduce the ratio of housestaff to attending physicians improved the perceived educational experience without altering objective healthcare outcomes."

The complex plasmid replication system includes Î±, Î² and Î³ origins of replication. Pairwise BLASTn comparison of pECTm80 with plasmid pE001 reveals a conserved plasmid backbone suggestive of a common ancestral lineage. Plasmid pECTm80 is of potential clinical importance, as it carries multiple genes to ensure its stable maintenance through successive bacterial cell divisions and multiple antibiotic resistance genes."
