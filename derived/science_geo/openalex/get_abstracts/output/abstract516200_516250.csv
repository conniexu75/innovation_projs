https://openalex.org/W2018005623,"MALAT1, a highly conserved long noncoding RNA, is deregulated in several types of cancers. However, its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and its posttranscriptional regulation remain poorly understood. In this study we provide first evidences that a posttranscriptional regulation mechanism of MALAT1 by miR-101 and miR-217 exists in ESCC cells. This posttranscriptional silencing of MALAT1 could significantly suppress the proliferation of ESCC cells through the arrest of G2/M cell cycle, which may be due to MALAT1-mediated up-regulation of p21 and p27 expression and the inhibition of B-MYB expression. Moreover, we also found the abilities of migration and invasion of ESCC cells were inhibited after overexpression of miR-101, miR-217, or MALAT1 siRNA. This might be attributed to the deregulation of downstream genes of MALAT1, such as MIA2, HNF4G, ROBO1, CCT4, and CTHRC1. A significant negative correlation exists between miR-101 or miR-217 and MALAT1 in 42 pairs of ESCC tissue samples and adjacent normal tissues. Mice xenograft data also support the tumor suppressor role of both miRNAs in ESCCs. MALAT1, a highly conserved long noncoding RNA, is deregulated in several types of cancers.

In eastern Asia ESCC shows a relatively high morbidity and mortality compared with Western countries (1.Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Hao Y. Xu J. Thun M.J. Cancer statistics, 2009.CA Cancer J.

Epidemiological evidences indicate that heavy alcohol drinking, tobacco smoking, micronutrient deficiency, and dietary carcinogen exposure are major environmental risk factors of this fatal disease (2.Gao Y.T.

Multiple cancer causal protein-coding genes, either as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, have been identified in the majority of cancer-associated human genomic loci (8.Eichler E.E. Flint J. Gibson G.

Accumulated evidences indicate that noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes also play a crucial role in malignant transformation and/or cancer progression (9.Esteller M. Non-coding RNAs in human disease.Nat.

Among different kinds of ncRNAs, the discovery of endogenous ∼22 nucleotides ncRNAs, named microRNAs (miRNAs), not only disclosed a new layer of gene expression regulation but also revealed the direct involvement of ncRNAs in tumorigenesis (12.Ambros V. microRNAs: tiny regulators with great potential.Cell. 2001; 107: 823-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 13.Bartel D.P.

Recently, many long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) ranging in size from several hundred base pairs (bp) to tens of thousands bp have been identified as a new class of cancer-associated ncRNAs in human (9.Esteller M.

Among >3000 human lncRNAs, <1% have been functionally characterized (14.Ponting C.P. Oliver P.L. Reik W. Evolution and functions of long noncoding RNAs.Cell. 2009; 136: 629-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4047) Google Scholar). Metastasis associated in lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1; also known as NEAT2) is a highly conserved mRNA-like lncRNA that was originally identified with high expression in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (15.Ji P. Diederichs S. Wang W. Böing S. Metzger R. Schneider P.M. Tidow N. Brandt B. Buerger H. Bulk E. Thomas M. Berdel W.E. Serve H. Müller-Tidow C.

It has also been found that MALAT1 is overexpressed in many other human malignancies, including breast, pancreas, colon, prostate, and liver (16.Lin R. Maeda S. Liu C. Karin M. Edgington T.S. A large noncoding RNA is a marker for murine hepatocellular carcinomas and a spectrum of human carcinomas.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar).

Therefore, fine-regulation of MALAT1 is critical for cancer development. Interestingly, lncRNAs may potentially interact with miRNAs and modulate each other's expression. On the one hand, lncRNAs may function as a competing endogenous RNAs to miRNAs. On the other hand, miRNAs could inhibit expression of lncRNAs through Argonaute 2 (Ago2)-mediated pathway (24.Jalali S.

However, how lncRNA MALAT1 is regulated by miRNAs at the transcriptional level and its involvement in ESCC remains largely unknown. In the current study we found that miR-101 and miR-217 could silence MALAT1 in ESCCs, and this posttranscriptional regulation may lead to inhibition of growth, invasion, and metastasis of ESCC cells. Total RNA was isolated from either culture cells or tissue samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were reverse-transcribed (RT) into cDNA with different RT primers using Revert Ace kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). PCR primers used for detecting MALAT1, β-actin, and MALAT1 downstream genes (p21, p27, B-MYB, MIA2, HNF4G, ROBO1, CCT4, and CTHRC1) were described previously (17.Tripathi V. Shen Z. Chakraborty A.

Stem-loop RT-PCR primers for human miR-101, miR-217, and U6 were synthesized by Ribobio (Guangzhou, China). For miR-101, miR-217, and U6 detection, RNA samples were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Revert Ace transcriptase by specific stem-loop RT primers according to the manufacturer's instruction. The stem-loop PCR was performed as previously described (26.Zhang Z. Zhu Z. Watabe K. Zhang X. Bai C. Xu M. Wu F. Mo Y.Y. Negative regulation of lncRNA GAS5 by miR-21.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 1558-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Transcript levels were measured against an endogenous control by quantitative PCR using the SYBR® Green I fluorogenic dye using the Mastercycler ep realplex system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Total RNA was extracted from KYSE30 cell line and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The sequence corresponding to the wild-type MALAT1 3′ end was amplified by PCR and inserted in the XbaI restriction site of the reporter plasmid pGL3-control (Promega). The primers used were as follows: 5′-AACTCTAGAGCTTGGCTCTTCCTTCTGTTC-3′/5′-AACTCTAGACCTCAACACTCAGCCTTTATC-3′. The plasmid was named as pGL3-MAL. For construction of MALAT1 reporter gene plasmids with a mutant miR-101 binding site or a mutant miR-217 binding site, the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's construction. These mutant plasmids were named as pGL3-mut101 or pGL3-mut217. Wild-type and mutant inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-MAL, pGL3-mut101, or pGL3-mut217) and a renilla luciferase vector (pRL-SV40, Promega) plus small RNAs (miR-101 mimics, miR-217 mimics, or negative control RNAs) were co-transfected into KYSE30, KYSE150, or KYSE450 cells with Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen). Three independent transfection experiments were performed, and each was done in triplicate. Firefly luciferase activities derived from pGL3-control-derived plasmids were normalized to renilla luciferase activity from pRL-SV40 using a luciferase assay system (Promega) as reported previously (29.Zhang X.

Human ESCC cell lines (KYSE30, KYSE150, and KYSE450) were cultured in RMPI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. KYSE30 and KYSE150 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well. KYSE450 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well. Cells were transfected with 10 nm miR-101 mimics, miR-217 mimics, negative control RNA (NC), or MALAT1 siRNAs (siM) (Genepharma, Shanghai, China) combined with Lipofectamine® RNAi Max (Invitrogen). Cells were then harvested by trypsin digestion, washed in cold PBS twice, dyed with trypan blue, and counted under microscopy at 24 and 48 h after transfection. A total of 8000 KYSE150 cells were transfected with 10 nm NC RNA, miR-101 mimics, miR-217 mimics, or siM into a 6-well cell culture plate. After 14 days, cells were washed with cold PBS twice and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. After cancer cells were dyed with crystal violet, colony number in each well was counted. When reaching ∼90% confluence, the cell layer was scratched. Cells were then continued cultured at 37 °C. The average extent of wound closure was quantified. During transwell assays, the transwell chambers were coated with 100 μl of BD Biosciences Matrigel™ overnight in cell incubator. Cells (1 × 104 cells in 200 μl of medium with 0.2% BSA) transfected with 10 nm miR-101 mimics, miR-217 mimics, siM, or NC were added to upper transwell chambers (pore 8 μm, Corning). A medium containing 10% FBS (650 μl) was added to the lower wells. After 48 h of incubation, cells were fixed and stained, and the nonmigratory cells were scraped from the upper part of the filter. Cells migrated to the lower wells through pores were stained with 0.2% crystal violet solution and counted. Cells were transfected with 10 nm miR-101 mimics, miR-217 mimics, or NC and harvested at 48 h after transfection. After washing with cold PBS twice, cells were fixed with ethanol at −20 °C overnight and washed with cold PBS twice again. After treatment with RNase A at 37 °C for 0.5 h and dyed with propidium iodide, the samples were detected with the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). During apoptosis assays, apoptosis was determined using the Alexa Fluor® 488 annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis kit (Invitrogen) with the FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Twenty-four pairs of ESCC tissues and esophagus normal tissues adjacent to the tumors were obtained from surgically removed specimens of ESCC patients in Shandong Cancer Hospital, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences. Eighteen pairs of ESCC and normal tissues were obtained from Huaian No. 2 Hospital. The tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen after resection. No patients in the current study received chemotherapy or radiation therapy before the surgery. This study was approved by the institutional Review Boards. A part of the tissue samples has been reported previously (31.Zhou L. Zhang X. Li Z. Zhou C. Li M. Tang X. Lu C. Li H. Yuan Q. Yang M.

Five-week-old female nude BALB/c mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratory (Beijing, China). To evaluate the tumor suppressor role of miR-101 and miR-217 in vivo, 1 × 107 KYSE150 cells transfected with 30 nm miR-101, miR-217, or siM were inoculated subcutaneously into fossa axillaris of 12 nude mice (n = 3 per group). Tumor volumes were measured three times a week. All procedures involving mice were approved by the institutional Review Board of Huaian No. 2 Hospital. All data are presented as the means ± S.D. unless stressed. Student's t test was used to examine the differences in luciferase reporter gene expression, and Spearman's correlation was used to test the significance of association between miR-101 or miR-217 expression and MALAT1 RNA expression. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with SPSS software package (Version 16.0, SPSS Inc.). Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) is a biochemical method used for identifying the binding sites of cellular RNA-binding proteins and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes. Using this method, Hafner et al. (33.Hafner M. Landthaler M. Burger L. Khorshid M. Hausser J. Berninger P. Rothballer A. Ascano Jr., M. Jungkamp A.C. Munschauer M. Ulrich A. Wardle G.S. Dewell S. Zavolan M. Tuschl T. Transcriptome-wide identification of RNA-binding protein and microRNA target sites by PAR-CLIP.Cell. 2010; 141: 129-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar) drew a precise map binding sites of Ago proteins across the transcriptome of HEK293 cells. Based on these data, Jalali et al. evaluated systematic transcriptome wide lncRNA-miRNA interactions (24.Jalali S. Bhartiya D. Lalwani M.K. Sivasubbu S. Scaria V. Systematic transcriptome wide analysis of lncRNA-miRNA interactions.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e53823Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), which provide a good resource for exploring the potential miRNA-dependent lncRNA regulation in human cells. Interestingly, we found that Ago2 protein probably binds to the 3′ end region (from 6615 to 6650 nt) of MALAT1 lncRNA in human cells (Fig. 1A). This MALAT1 6615–6650-nt region was highly conserved in different mammals (Fig. 1A), suggesting its potential function significance as a posttranscriptional regulation region. MiRcode was then utilized to predict potential miRNA candidates, which may target this region. As a result, miR-101, miR-217, miR-383, and miR-503 were identified as candidates for further evaluations (Fig. 1A). To verified whether MALAT1 might be regulated by miRNAs, we first knocked down Ago2 (the catalytic subunit of RNA-induced silencing complex, RISC) as well as Dicer (an essential enzyme during miRNA maturing) and examined expression changes of MALAT1 in ESCC cells (Fig. 1, B and 1C). As expected, we found 1.2–1.5-fold elevated MALAT1 RNA expression after depressed Ago2 expression in KYSE30, KYSE150, and KYSE450 cells. Also, there was a 1.2–1.4-fold increased MALAT1 RNA expression after inhibition of Dicer expression in these cell lines. These results gave some clues that miRNAs might participate in MALAT1 regulation. We then tested the possible regulation of MALAT1 RNA expression by miR-101, miR-217, miR-383, and miR-503 in ESCC cells (Fig. 1D). Although overexpression of miR-101 and miR-217 could significantly inhibit MALAT1 RNA expression, miR-383 and miR-503 showed little impact. To validate this observation, antagomirs of miR-101 and miR-217 were employed to inhibit endogenous miR-101 and miR-217 expression. We found a 1.2–1.6-fold up-regulation of MALAT1 RNA expression in ESCC cells after transfection with antagomirs of both miRNAs (Fig. 1E). Given the relative low endogenous expression of miR-101 and miR-217 in ESCC cell lines, it was possible that further inhibition of miR-101 and miR-217 by antagomirs only yielded a marginal effect on MALAT1 RNA expression, whereas their low expression in ECSS cells also provided a clue that miR-101 and miR-217 might be tumor suppressors. To examine the potential miRNA-lincRNA interaction experimentally, a 343-bp human MALAT1 3′ end region (from 6423 to 6765 nucleotides) was subcloned downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (named as pGL3-MAL) and co-transfected into KYSE30, KYSE150, and KYSE450 cells with miR-101 mimics, miR-217 mimics, or NC RNA. MiR-101 produced a 42.8, 58.4, and 41.5% decrease in relative luciferase activity compared with NC RNA-transfected KYSE30, KYSE150, and KYSE450 cells (all p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B, left panel). Similarly, there was 30.3, 86.7, and 35.1% decreased relative luciferase activity in these ESCC cells with miR-217 overexpression compared with the NC RNA group (all p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B, left panel). We also measured firefly luciferase mRNA expression with RT-quantitative PCR. As expected, pGL3-MAL firefly luciferase mRNA level was significantly inhibited by miR-101 or miR-217 (Fig. 2B, right panel). An analogous reporter with point substitutions disrupting the target sites of miR-101 or miR-217 (Fig. 2A) was also co-transfected with miR-101 mimics, miR-217 mimics, or NC RNA. There was no significant decrease in relative luciferase activity for cells transfected with miR-101 or miR-217 mimics compared with NC RNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2B, left panel). It has been reported that lncRNA MALAT1 can modulate cellular proliferation through regulating cell cycle progression. Therefore, miR-101 and miR-217 may also be involved in control of ESCC cell growth through silencing MALAT1 RNA expression. We found that miR-101, miR-217, or MALAT1 siRNA could significantly inhibit proliferation of KYSE150 and KYSE30 cells in both a dose-dependent and time-dependent way (all p < 0.01) (Fig. 3A). Colony formation assays also support the tumor suppressor role of both miRNAs (Fig. 3B). To gain insight into the functional relevance of miR-101 and miR-217 through MALAT1 depletion, we examined the impacts of these miRNAs on KYSE30 cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Fig. 3C). Compared with NC RNA-transfected KYSE30 cells, both miR-101 and miR-217 could result in a significantly reduced G1 population (NC, 59.4%; miR-101, 31.7%; miR-217, 32.1%), marginally increased replication (S-phase) (NC, 30.9%; miR-101, 34.2%; miR-217, 42.5%), and significantly elevated G2/M population (NC, 9.6%; miR-101, 34.1%; miR-217, 25.4%). Similar results have been found in KYSE150 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). However, no significant miRNA-induced apoptosis was observed in both cell lines (data not shown). Moreover, we did not observe a growth depression in KYSE450 cells (data not shown). Because impacts of lncRNA MALAT1 on ESCC invasion and metastasis were still largely unclear, we investigated how siM, miR-101, and miR-217 regulate migration and invasion of ESCC cells. The wound-healing assays demonstrated that siM, miR-101, and miR-217 impaired the motility of the KYSE30, KYSE150, and KYSE450 cells compared with control cells transfected with NC RNA (Fig. 4A). Next, the impact of miR-101 and miR-217 on invasiveness of KYSE30, KYSE150, and KYSE450 cells was determined using the Matrigel invasion assay system. Reduced invasion ability of ESCC cells was observed after elevated expression of miR-101 and miR-217 (Fig. 4B). In line with this, MALAT1 siRNA can also inhibit the invasion of these ESCC cells (Fig. 4B). We also confirmed this observation using antagomirs of miR-101 and miR-217 and found enhanced invasion ability of ESCC cells transfected with these antagomirs (Fig. 4B). Considering the regulation of miR-101 and miR-217 on cell cycle progression as well as metastasis of ESCC cells, we examined expression of multiple MALAT1 downstream genes involved in cell cycle control (p21, p27, and B-MYB) and metastasis regulation (MIA2, ROBO1, CTHRC1, and CCT4) (Fig. 5). Neither miR-101 nor miR-217 has been proven or has potential binding sites in these genes predicted by Targetscan. We found that overexpression of miR-101 and miR-217 or siM up-regulated expression of p21 and p27 and inhibited B-MYB expression in both KYSE30 and KYSE150 cell lines but not in KYSE450, which was consistent with our results on how these miRNAs influence ESCC cell proliferation and cell cycle. Moreover, miR-101, miR-217, or MALAT1 siRNA could not only increase expression of MIA2, HNF4G, and ROBO1, which are negative regulators of migration and invasion, but also depress expression of CCT4 and CTHRC1, which are positive regulators of metastasis, in all three ESCC cell lines. We further examined expression of miR-101, miR-217, and lncRNA MALAT1 in 42 pairs of ESCC tissue samples, and adjacent normal tissues from two different medical centers. For Shandong cohort, significant up-regulation of MALAT1 in ESCC tissues was observed compared with normal tissues (p < 0.01) (see Fig. 6A"
https://openalex.org/W2053654862,"Neurotrophins and their receptors are frequently expressed in malignant gliomas, yet their functions are largely unknown. Previously, we have shown that p75 neurotrophin receptor is required for glioma invasion and proliferation. However, the role of Trk receptors has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the importance of TrkB and TrkC in survival of brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs). Here, we show that human malignant glioma tissues and also tumor-initiating cells isolated from fresh human malignant gliomas express the neurotrophin receptors TrkB and TrkC, not TrkA, and they also express neurotrophins NGF, BDNF, and neurotrophin 3 (NT3). Specific activation of TrkB and TrkC receptors by ligands BDNF and NT3 enhances tumor-initiating cell viability through activation of ERK and Akt pathways. Conversely, TrkB and TrkC knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of Trk signaling decreases neurotrophin-dependent ERK activation and BTIC growth. Further, pharmacological inhibition of both ERK and Akt pathways blocked BDNF, and NT3 stimulated BTIC survival. Importantly, attenuation of BTIC growth by EGFR inhibitors could be overcome by activation of neurotrophin signaling, and neurotrophin signaling is sufficient for long term BTIC growth as spheres in the absence of EGF and FGF. Our results highlight a novel role for neurotrophin signaling in brain tumor and suggest that Trks could be a target for combinatorial treatment of malignant glioma. Background: The role of Trk neurotrophin receptors in glioma is unknown. Results: TrkB and TrkC are required for survival of brain tumor-initiating cells in the absence of EGF and FGF. Conclusion: Trk receptors can control the survival of BTICs in the absence of EGF and FGF. Significance: Trks may be important targets for treatment of malignant gliomas."

Recently, we have shown that low metformin concentrations found in the portal vein suppress glucose production in hepatocytes through activation of AMPK. Moreover, low concentrations of metformin were found to activate AMPK by increasing the phosphorylation of AMPKα at Thr-172. However, the mechanism underlying the increase in AMPKα phosphorylation at Thr-172 and activation by metformin remains unknown. In the current study, we find that low concentrations of metformin promote the formation of the AMPK αβγ complex, resulting in an increase in net phosphorylation of the AMPK α catalytic subunit at Thr-172 by augmenting phosphorylation by LKB1 and antagonizing dephosphorylation by PP2C."

https://openalex.org/W2071694479,"The identification of biological and pathophysiological processes implicated in different forms of dementia is itself dependent on reliable descriptions of cognitive performance and capacities. However, traditional instruments are often unable to detect subtle declines in cognitive functions due to natural variation at the time of testing. Mobile technologies permit the repeated assessment of cognitive functions and may thereby provide more reliable descriptions of early cognitive difficulties that are inaccessible to clinic or hospital-based instruments. This assessment strategy is also able to characterize in real-time the dynamic associations between cognitive performance and specific daily life behaviors or activities. In a cohort of elderly rural residents, 60 individuals were administered neuropsychological and neuroimaging exams as well as a one-week period of electronic ambulatory monitoring of behavior, semantic memory performance, and daily life experiences. Whereas imaging markers were unrelated to traditional neuropsychological test scores, they were significantly associated with mobile assessments of semantic memory performance. Moreover, certain daily life activities such as reading or completing crossword puzzles were associated with increases in semantic memory performance over the subsequent hours of the same day. The revolution in mobile technologies provides unprecedented opportunities to overcome the barriers of time and context that characterize traditional hospital and clinical-based assessments. The combination of both novel and traditional methods should provide the best opportunity for identifying the earliest risk factors and biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2051724555,"The Fc domain of IgG has been the target of multiple mutational studies aimed at altering the pH-dependent IgG/FcRn interaction to modulate IgG pharmacokinetics. These studies have yielded antibody variants with disparate pharmacokinetic characteristics, ranging from extended in vivo half-life to those exhibiting extremely rapid clearance. To better understand pH-dependent binding parameters that govern these outcomes and limit FcRn-mediated half-life extension, we generated a panel of novel Fc variants with high affinity binding at acidic pH that vary in pH 7.4 affinities and assessed pharmacokinetic outcomes. Pharmacokinetic studies in human FcRn transgenic mice and cynomolgus monkeys showed that multiple variants with increased FcRn affinities at acidic pH exhibited extended serum half-lives relative to the parental IgG. Importantly, the results reveal an underappreciated affinity threshold of neutral pH binding that determines IgG recycling efficiency. Variants with pH 7.4 FcRn affinities below this threshold recycle efficiently and can exhibit increased serum persistence. Increasing neutral pH FcRn affinity beyond this threshold reduced serum persistence by offsetting the benefits of increased pH 6.0 binding. Ultra-high affinity binding to FcRn at both acidic and neutral pH leads to rapid serum clearance."

Two anti-human TNFR1 Nbs were linked with an anti-albumin Nb to generate Nb Alb-70-96 named “TNF Receptor-One Silencer” (TROS). TROS selectively binds and inhibits TNF/TNFR1 and lymphotoxin-α/TNFR1 signaling with good affinity and IC50 values, both of which are in the nanomolar range. Surface plasmon resonance analysis reveals that TROS competes with TNF for binding to human TNFR1. In HEK293T cells, TROS strongly reduces TNF-induced gene expression, like IL8 and TNF, in a dose-dependent manner; and in ex vivo cultured colon biopsies of CD patients, TROS inhibits inflammation. Finally, in liver chimeric humanized mice, TROS antagonizes inflammation in a model of acute TNF-induced liver inflammation, reflected in reduced human IL8 expression in liver and reduced IL6 levels in serum. These results demonstrate the considerable potential of TROS and justify the evaluation of TROS in relevant disease animal models of both acute and chronic inflammation and eventually in patients.

https://openalex.org/W2054275327,"The majority of terrestrial biomass is wood, but the elemental composition of its potential consumers, xylophages, differs hugely from that of wood. This causes a severe nutritional imbalance. We studied the stoichiometric relationships of 11 elements (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Na) in three species of pine-xylem-feeding insects, Stictoleptura rubra, Arhopalus rusticus (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae) and Chalcophora mariana (Coleoptera, Buprestidae), to elucidate their mechanisms of tissue growth and to match their life histories to their dietary constraints. These beetles do not differ from other Coleoptera in their absolute elemental compositions, which are approximately 1000 (N), 100 (P, Cu) and 50 (K, Na) times higher than in dead but undecayed pine wood. This discrepancy diminishes along the wood decay gradient, but the elemental concentrations remain higher by an order of magnitude in beetles than in highly decayed wood. Numerical simulation of the life history of S. rubra shows that feeding on nutrient-poor undecayed wood would extend its development time to implausible values, whereas feeding on highly decomposed wood (heavily infected with fungi) would barely balance its nutritional budget during the long development period of this species. The changes in stoichiometry indicate that the relative change in the nutrient levels in decaying wood cannot be attributed solely to carbon loss resulting from decomposer respiration: the action of fungi substantially enriches the decaying wood with nutritional elements imported from the outside of the system, making it a suitable food for wood-eating invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2067299582,"Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages and spent photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells requires several proteins, including MerTK receptors and associated Gas6 and protein S ligands. In the retina, POS phagocytosis is rhythmic, and MerTK is activated promptly after light onset via the αvβ5 integrin receptor and its ligand MFG-E8, thus generating a phagocytic peak. The phagocytic burst is limited in time, suggesting a down-regulation mechanism that limits its duration. Our previous data showed that MerTK helps control POS binding of integrin receptors at the RPE cell surface as a negative feedback loop. Our present results show that a soluble form of MerTK (sMerTK) is released in the conditioned media of RPE-J cells during phagocytosis and in the interphotoreceptor matrix of the mouse retina during the morning phagocytic peak. In contrast to macrophages, the two cognate MerTK ligands have an opposite effect on phagocytosis and sMerTK release, whereas the integrin ligand MFG-E8 markedly increases both phagocytosis and sMerTK levels. sMerTK acts as a decoy receptor blocking the effect of both MerTK ligands. Interestingly, stimulation of sMerTK release decreases POS binding. Conversely, blocking MerTK cleavage increased mostly POS binding by RPE cells.

In addition to the sequential receptor-ligand activation steps undertaken by the αvβ5 integrin receptor, MerTK also controls the number of particles to be engulfed (36.Wu Y. Singh S. Georgescu M.-M.

Cell. 2012; 104: 326-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), thus acting as a negative feedback regulator. However, in contrast to macrophages, RPE cell phagocytosis follows a diurnal cyclic rhythm despite the permanent contact between POS and RPE cells (5.LaVail M.M. Rod outer segment disk shedding in rat retina: relationship to cyclic lighting.Science. 1976; 194: 1071-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), suggesting that a more sophisticated regulatory mechanism exists in RPE cells. There are numerous ways by which ligand/receptor function can be regulated, such as the control of cell surface receptor numbers, their ligand affinities, or the production of a soluble form of the receptor by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain (38.Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Soluble receptors for cytokines and growth factors: generation and biological function.Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Soluble receptors can have more than one occupation (39.Heaney M.L. Golde D.W. Soluble cytokine receptors.Blood. 1996; 87: 847-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); they may function as binding proteins to stabilize ligands in the extracellular matrix and enhance interaction with the membrane-bound receptors, can down-regulate ligand-related activation and associated downstream signaling, or might act as decoy receptors by competing with full-length membrane receptors for ligand binding. Recently, both Axl and MerTK have been shown to be cleaved and released as soluble proteins by fibroblasts and macrophages, respectively (40.Costa M. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Cleavage and release of a soluble form of the receptor tyrosine kinase ARK in vitro and in vivo.J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 41.Sather S.

A soluble form of the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase inhibits macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells and platelet aggregation.Blood. 2007; 109: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The soluble form of MerTK (sMerTK) was found to function as a decoy receptor for Gas6 and inhibit activation of full-length membrane-bound receptors (41.Sather S. Kenyon K.D. Lefkowitz J.B. Liang X. Varnum B.C. Henson P.M. Graham D.K. A soluble form of the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase inhibits macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells and platelet aggregation.Blood. 2007; 109: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that sMerTK is released by RPE cells in vitro, and MerTK cleavage is potentiated by MFG-E8. In addition, sMerTK contributes to the down-regulation of POS binding and subsequent internalization by acting as a decoy receptor as well as by down-regulating directly the phagocytic capacity of RPE cells. Furthermore, sMerTK release is rhythmic in vivo and thus may help limit the phagocytic peak duration. Reagents were from Invitrogen, unless otherwise stated. Recombinant proteins and antibodies against mouse MerTK, mouse MFG-E8, and mouse Gas6 were from R & D Systems, and recombinant protein S was from MP Biomedicals. Other antibodies used against various proteins were as follows: PEDF (Abcam); mouse CD51 (αv integrin) and mouse Tyro3 (BD Transduction Laboratories); rabbit β5 integrin H-96, MerTK E-20, and IRBP C-18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit tubulin (Sigma); rabbit ZO-1 (Invitrogen); and rabbit phospho-MerTK (FabGennix Inc. International). J774 macrophage cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% FCS, supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids and 1% sodium pyruvate. The rat RPE-J cell line (ATCC) was maintained at 32 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM with 4% CELLect Gold FCS (ICN), supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and 1% nonessential amino acids. For experiments, J774 cells were used 3 days after splitting. RPE cells were plated on Alcian blue-coated 24- or 96-well plates and allowed to polarize for 6 days before use. Wild-type mice (129T2/SvEmsJ) were housed under cyclic 12-h light/12-h dark conditions (light onset at 8:00 h) and fed ad libitum. Animals were handled according to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. For experiments, mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation at different times during the day. The 11 time points analyzed were as follows: 6:00, 7:00, 8:00 (light onset), 9:00, 10:00 (phagocytosis peak), 11:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 (light offset), 22:00, and 24:00. Eyeballs were carefully enucleated and rinsed in HBSS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. The lens and vitreous humor were dissected out. Retinas were delicately separated from the eyecups containing the RPE/choroid layers and quickly frozen in independent tubes in liquid nitrogen. For each animal, one eye was used for RNA extraction and gene expression testing and the second eye for protein expression level assessment (see below). POS were isolated according to established protocols (42.Parinot C. Rieu Q. Chatagnon J. Finnemann S.C. Nandrot E.F. Large-scale purification of porcine or bovine photoreceptor outer segments for phagocytosis assays on retinal pigment epithelial cells.J. Vis. Exp. 2014; 94: e52100Google Scholar) from porcine eyes fresh from the slaughterhouse. Briefly, in the dark under dim red light, eyeballs were separated into anterior and posterior halves, and retinae were collected in homogenization buffer (20% sucrose, 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm taurine). Following collection, the retina suspension was shaken to disrupt the different cell layers and filtered three times through gauze to remove large tissue fragments. The resulting crude retina suspensions were layered onto continuous 25–60% sucrose gradients (in Tris acetate, pH 7.2, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm taurine) and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 50 min at 4 °C (Beckman SW32-Ti swing rotor). The resulting orange bands were collected and diluted in 4–5 volumes of buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.2, 5 mm taurine, followed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C (Beckman JA25.50 rotor). Pellets were washed in buffer containing 10% sucrose, 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.2, 5 mm taurine. The suspensions were spun at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C before resuspending in 10% sucrose, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 5 mm taurine and centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Isolated POS were resuspended, counted, aliquoted, and frozen in DMEM containing 2.5% sucrose. For labeling, POS were resuspended in 10% sucrose, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 5 mm taurine and incubated with 1 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Molecular Probes) for 1.5 h at room temperature by rotating. Labeled POS were then washed and frozen as described above. Cells were challenged with ∼10 POS per RPE cell resuspended in the culture medium without FCS for durations ranging from 1 h to overnight depending on the experiment. In some assays, recombinant integrin or MerTK ligand proteins at various concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μg/ml and recombinant MerTK (200 ng/μl) were incubated with FITC-POS in serum-free medium for 1 h at room temperature on a rotator to allow binding. Coated FITC-POS were washed twice in equal volumes of serum-free medium and resuspended at equal particle concentration before challenging the cells. For POS phagocytosis quantification assays, cells were washed three times with PBS-CM (0.2 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+) at the end of the incubation times. To measure internalized POS, some wells were incubated with trypan blue for 10 min to quench fluorescence of surface-bound FITC-labeled POS as described previously (13.Finnemann S.C. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A.D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Phagocytosis of rod outer segments by retinal pigment epithelial cells requires α(v)β5 integrin for binding but not for internalization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12932-12937Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Nontreated wells allow the measurement of total phagocytosis, corresponding to the fluorescence of both bound and internalized POS. All cells were then washed twice with PBS-CM and fixed with ice-cold methanol. Nuclei were counterstained using DAPI. FITC-POS and DAPI-labeled nuclei were quantified by fluorescence plate reading (Infinite M1000, Magellan 6 software, Tecan). Binding ratios were calculated by subtracting results obtained in internalization (trypan blue-treated) from total phagocytosis (untreated) wells. Corresponding S.D. were calculated using Equation 1,S.D.binding=((S.D.total2/ntotal)+(S.D.intern2/nintern))(Eq-1) Cells were incubated in serum-free medium or POS for various lengths of time to obtain MerTK release in the culture medium. Soluble proteins present in the conditioned media (CM) of cultured cells were collected and concentrated ∼6-fold using Amicon ultracentrifugal filter units (Millipore) with a cutoff limit of 30 kDa. When CM were used to resuspend POS, the cutoff limit of the columns was at 100 kDa, to remove growth factors and ligands secreted by RPE cells from the CM, and the concentration factor was ∼50-fold. Soluble proteins from the interphotoreceptor matrix of mouse eyes were washed from each separated cup (RPE/choroid) and corresponding retina in HBSS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 20 min on a shaker at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C for further clean-up (Sorvall M120 S.E. Discovery, S120-AT2 rotor). Cultured cells were solubilized in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, buffer with 1 mm PMSF and 1% each of protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). Tissues were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, with 1 mm PMSF, and 1% each of protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. Whole cell lysates representing ∼8% of 1 well of a 24-well plate and 7.5% of one eye cup/retina were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman). For soluble extracellular proteins, ∼30% of concentrated conditioned media and 25% of interphotoreceptor matrix proteins mixed 1:1 between separated cups and matched retina samples were used. Immunoblots were probed with primary antibodies overnight and secondary antibodies for 2 h, washed four times in 1× TBS, 0.05–1% Tween 20 at room temperature followed by chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Chemiluminescence films (Amersham Biosciences) were scanned, and signals were quantified using ImageJ 1.45s (National Institutes of Health). After incubation with unlabeled POS, cells were washed twice with HBSS-CM (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) or PBS-CM for surface or intracellular labeling, respectively. Briefly, for live labeling of cell surface proteins, antibodies were diluted in HBSS-CM, and cells were incubated for 45 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with PBS-CM before TCA fixation on ice for 15 min. Fixed cells were re-hydrated with PBS-CM and treated with 30 mm glycine in PBS-CM, and nonspecific sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS-CM. Primary antibody incubation for intracellular labeling were performed overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with 1% BSA in PBS-CM. AlexaFluor secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were incubated on cells for 2 h at room temperature, followed by washing with PBS-CM, labeling cell nuclei with DAPI, and mounting onto glass slides with Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc.). All fluorescent images were acquired with an upright Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope using the Fluoview 2.1c software. Similar stacks of images were compiled and further treated equally for signal output levels using Adobe Photoshop CS6. Relative surface fluorescence levels were quantified with Image J 1.45s. Total RNAs were extracted from separated retina and RPE/choroid according to the manufacturer's protocol using two DNase steps (Illustra RNAspin Mini, GE Healthcare). RNAs were verified on 1% agarose gels and yields assessed using a spectrophotometer. 500 ng of RNAs were converted to cDNAs in a 50-μl volume following the instructions provided for 1 h at 42 °C (Reverse Transcription System, Promega). qPCRs using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix were processed as follows on a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System apparatus (Applied Biosystems): 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min. The ribosomal protein Rho0 (Rplp0) gene was used as internal control. Oligonucleotides with the following sequences were designed to obtain 150-bp amplicons: Rplp0, forward 5′-CCTGAAGTGCTCGACATCAC and reverse 5′-TGCCAGGACGCGCTTGTAC; MerTK, forward 5′-CGTCTGTCCTAACCGTACCT and reverse 5′-GTACTGTTGAGGATATGGACT. Relative amounts of MerTK were calculated using the 2∧−ΔΔCt method evaluating differences in fold expression with the internal control and amounts at 8 a.m. (8:00, light onset) being set as 1. To investigate the possible role of shed MerTK receptors on POS tethering and internalization, CM were collected after the overnight incubation of RPE-J or J774 cells on 10-cm dishes and concentrated on filter columns with a cutoff at 100 kDa to eliminate ligands and growth factors. Each CM from one dish was used for 20 wells of a 96-well plate. FITC-POS were resuspended either in medium or in each CM, and naive cells were ch"

https://openalex.org/W2006963735,"Human skin is a primary target of oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from both extrinsic and intrinsic sources. Oxidative stress inhibits the production of collagen, the most abundant protein in skin, and thus contributes to connective tissue aging. Here we report that cysteine-rich protein 61 (CCN1), a negative regulator of collagen production, is markedly induced by ROS and mediates loss of type I collagen in human dermal fibroblasts. Conversely, antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine significantly reduced CCN1 expression and prevented ROS-induced loss of type I collagen in both human dermal fibroblasts and human skin in vivo. ROS increased c-Jun, a critical member of transcription factor AP-1 complex, and increased c-Jun binding to the AP-1 site of the CCN1 promoter. Functional blocking of c-Jun significantly reduced CCN1 promoter and gene expression and thus prevented ROS-induced loss of type I collagen. Targeting the c-Jun/CCN1 axis may provide clinical benefit for connective tissue aging in human skin."
https://openalex.org/W2073612080,"Delayed transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome is a nearly universal phenomenon in metazoans. Immediately following fertilization, development is controlled by maternally deposited products, and it is not until later stages that widespread activation of the zygotic genome occurs. Although the mechanisms driving this genome activation are currently unknown, the transcriptional activator Zelda (ZLD) has been shown to be instrumental in driving this process in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we define functional domains of ZLD required for both DNA binding and transcriptional activation. We show that the C-terminal cluster of four zinc fingers mediates binding to TAGteam DNA elements in the promoters of early expressed genes. All four zinc fingers are required for this activity, and splice isoforms lacking three of the four zinc fingers fail to activate transcription. These truncated splice isoforms dominantly suppress activation by the full-length, embryonically expressed isoform. We map the transcriptional activation domain of ZLD to a central region characterized by low complexity. Despite relatively little sequence conservation within this domain, ZLD orthologs from Drosophila virilis, Anopheles gambiae, and Nasonia vitripennis activate transcription in D. melanogaster cells. Transcriptional activation by these ZLD orthologs suggests that ZLD functions through conserved interactions with a protein cofactor(s). We have identified distinct DNA-binding and activation domains within the critical transcription factor ZLD that controls the initial activation of the zygotic genome."
https://openalex.org/W1985646955,"Annexin 1 (ANXA1) is an endogenous anti-inflammatory protein implicated in cancer. ANXA1 was previously shown to be regulated by hsa-miR-196a. However, whether ANXA1 itself regulates microRNA (miR) expression is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the regulation of miR by ANXA1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells. MCF7-EV (Empty vector) and MCF7-V5 (ANXA1-V5 expressing cells) were subjected to a miR microarray. Microarray analysis revealed a number of miRNAs which were dysregulated in MCF7-V5 cells. 2 novel miRNAs (miR562 and miR26b*) were validated, cloned and functionally characterized. As ANXA1 constitutively activates NF-κB activity to modulate breast cancer metastasis, we found that miR26b* and miR562 directly targeted the canonical NF-κB pathway by targeting the 3′ UTR and inhibiting expression of Rel A (p65) and NF-κB1 (p105) respectively. MiR562 inhibited wound healing, which was reversed when ANXA1 was overexpressed. Overexpression of either miR562 or miR26b* in MCF-7 cells enhanced endothelial tube formation when cocultured with human umbilical cord endothelial cells while conversely, treatment of MCF7 cells with either anti-miR562 or anti-miR26b* inhibited endothelial tube formation after co-culture. Further analysis of miR562 revealed that miR562-transfected cell conditioned media enhances endothelial cell tube formation, indicating that miR562 increased angiogenic secreted factors from MCF-7 breast tumor cells. TNFα was increased upon overexpression of miR562, which was reversed when ANXA1 was co-transfected In conclusion, this data suggests that ANXA1-regulated miR26b* and miR562 may play a role in wound healing and tumor-induced endothelial cell tube formation by targeting NF-κB expression and point towards a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1987284357,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a morphine-conjugate vaccine (M-KLH) on the acquisition, maintenance, and reinstatement of heroin self-administration (HSA) in rats, and on heroin and metabolite distribution during heroin administration that approximated the self-administered dosing rate. Vaccination with M-KLH blocked heroin-primed reinstatement of heroin responding. Vaccination also decreased HSA at low heroin unit doses but produced a compensatory increase in heroin self-administration at high unit doses. Vaccination shifted the heroin dose-response curve to the right, indicating reduced heroin potency, and behavioral economic demand curve analysis further confirmed this effect. In a separate experiment heroin was administered at rates simulating heroin exposure during HSA. Heroin and its active metabolites, 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM) and morphine, were retained in plasma and metabolite concentrations were reduced in brain in vaccinated rats compared to controls. Reductions in 6-AM concentrations in brain after vaccination were consistent with the changes in HSA rates accompanying vaccination. These data provide evidence that 6-AM is the principal mediator of heroin reinforcement, and the principal target of the M-KLH vaccine, in this model. While heroin vaccines may have potential as therapies for heroin addiction, high antibody to drug ratios appear to be important for obtaining maximal efficacy."

In vivo, amyloid deposits are found in the extracellular space and involve a variety of accessory molecules, such as glycosaminoglycans, one of the main components of the extracellular matrix. Glycosaminoglycans are a group of negatively charged heteropolysaccharides composed of repeating disaccharide units. In this study, we investigated the effect of glycosaminoglycans on the kinetics of amyloid fibril formation of three AL cardiac amyloidosis light chains. These proteins have similar thermodynamic stability but exhibit different kinetics of fibril formation. We also studied single restorative and reciprocal mutants and wild type germ line control protein. We found that the type of glycosaminoglycan has a different effect on the kinetics of fibril formation, and this effect seems to be associated with the natural propensity of each AL protein to form fibrils. Heparan sulfate accelerated AL-12, AL-09, κI Y87H, and AL-103 H92D fibril formation; delayed fibril formation for AL-103; and did not promote any fibril formation for AL-12 R65S, AL-103 delP95aIns, or κI O18/O8. Chondroitin sulfate A, on the other hand, showed a strong fibril formation inhibition for all proteins. We propose that heparan sulfate facilitates the formation of transient amyloidogenic conformations of AL light chains, thereby promoting amyloid formation, whereas chondroitin sulfate A kinetically traps partially unfolded intermediates, and further fibril elongation into fibrils is inhibited, resulting in formation/accumulation of oligomeric/protofibrillar aggregates.

https://openalex.org/W2030637216,"In the present study we investigated the interplay between matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) and NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) in the process of dopamine (DA) neuronal death. We found that MMP3 activation causes the induction of Nox1 via mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and subsequently Rac1 activation, eventually leading to Nox1-derived superoxide generation in a rat DA neuronal N27 cells exposed to 6-OHDA. While a MMP3 inhibitor, NNGH, largely attenuated mitochondrial ROS and subsequent Nox1 induction, both apocynin, a putative Nox inhibitor and GKT137831, a Nox1 selective inhibitor failed to reduce 6-OHDA-induced mitochondrial ROS. However, both inhibitors for MMP3 and Nox1 similarly attenuated 6-OHDA-induced N27 cell death. RNAi-mediated selective inhibition of MMP3 or Nox1 showed that knockdown of either MMP3 or Nox1 significantly reduced 6-OHDA-induced ROS generation in N27 cells. While 6-OHDA-induced Nox1 was abolished by MMP3 knockdown, Nox1 knockdown did not alter MMP3 expression. Direct overexpression of autoactivated MMP3 (actMMP3) in N27 cells or in rat substantia nigra (SN) increased expression of Nox1. Selective knockdown of Nox1 in the SN achieved by adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression of Nox1-specific shRNA largely attenuated the actMMP3-mediated dopaminergic neuronal loss. Furthermore, Nox1 expression was significantly attenuated in Mmp3 null mice treated with N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Together we established novel molecular mechanisms underlying oxidative stress-mediated dopaminergic neuronal death in which MMP3 activation is a key upstream event that leads to mitochondrial ROS, Nox1 induction and eventual dopaminergic neuronal death. Our findings may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approach."

Many tissues, including the lungs, heart, skin, and eyes, can develop excessive scar tissue as a result of tissue injury, chronic inflammation, or autoimmune disease. Unfortunately, there are few, if any, effective treatments to prevent excess scarring, and new treatment strategies are needed. Using HEK293FT cells stably transfected with a TGFβ-dependent luciferase reporter, we performed a small molecule screen to identify novel compounds with antiscarring activity. We discovered that the polyether ionophore salinomycin potently inhibited the formation of scar-forming myofibroblasts. Salinomycin (250 nm) blocked TGFβ-dependent expression of the cardinal myofibroblast products α smooth muscle actin, calponin, and collagen in primary human fibroblasts without causing cell death. Salinomycin blocked phosphorylation and activation of TAK1 and p38, two proteins fundamentally involved in signaling myofibroblast and scar formation. Expression of constitutively active mitogen activated kinase kinase 6, which activates p38 MAPK, attenuated the ability of salinomycin to block myofibroblast formation, demonstrating that salinomycin targets the p38 kinase pathway to disrupt TGFβ signaling.

PTS2-carrying proteins interact with their cognate receptor protein PEX7 that mediates their transport to peroxisomes by a concerted action with a co-receptor protein, which in mammals is the PTS1 receptor PEX5L. Using a modified version of the mammalian two-hybrid assay, we demonstrate that the interaction strength between cargo and PEX7 is drastically increased in the presence of the co-receptor PEX5L. In addition, cargo binding is a prerequisite for the interaction between PEX7 and PEX5L and ectopic overexpression of PTS2-carrying cargo protein drastically increases the formation of PEX7-PEX5L complexes in this assay. Consistently, we find that the peroxisomal transfer of PEX7 depends on cargo binding and that ectopic overexpression of cargo protein stimulates this process. Thus, the sequential formation of a highly stable trimeric complex involving cargo protein, PEX7 and PEX5L stabilizes cargo binding and is a prerequisite for PTS2-mediated peroxisomal import.

Thus, the sequential formation of a highly stable trimeric complex involving cargo protein, PEX7 and PEX5L stabilizes cargo binding and is a prerequisite for PTS2-mediated peroxisomal import. Proteins compartmentalized within organelles reach their destination by the concerted action of a targeting signal and the corresponding receptor protein that recognizes such signals and mediates the initiation of protein transport (1.Blobel G.

Soluble proteins destined for peroxisomes are folded before the import and, thus, this import system has a special status. Peroxisomes are single membrane-bound organelles that exert a variety of metabolic functions such as degradation of hydrogen peroxide and fatty acids (α- and β-oxidation) (5.Wanders R.J.

Their importance is highlighted by the existence of severe inherited human disorders caused either by the absence of all peroxisomal functions (peroxisome biogenesis disorders) (6.Steinberg S.J. Dodt G. Raymond G.V. Braverman N.E. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders.Biochim. Biophys.

The import of peroxisomal matrix proteins is initiated by the recognition of a peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS) 2The abbreviations used are: PTSperoxisomal targeting signalRCDP1rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1EGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinUASupstream activating sequenceRFPred fluorescent protein. by cognate receptors. One type of signal (PTS1) is found at the extreme C terminus of the protein and is recognized by the receptor PEX5, whereas another type of signal (PTS2) is located in proximity to the N terminus of the protein and is recognized by the receptor PEX7. In fungi and metazoa the majority of peroxisomal matrix proteins is imported via the PTS1-dependent pathway, whereas in plants numerous proteins use the PTS2-dependent import pathway (8.Reumann S.

The PTS2-type peroxisomal targeting signal was originally described as a peptide with the consensus sequence (R/K)(L/V/I)X5(Q/H)(L/A) (9.Glover J.R. Andrews D.W. Subramani S. Rachubinski R.A.

Thereby, the previously defined positions are indicated as S1 to S4, whereas the intermediate five less characterized positions are indicated from X1 to X5 resulting in S1S2X1X2X3X4X5S3S4, which will be used throughout the text. Frequency-based approaches predicted revised consensus sequences for PTS2 motifs: R-(L/V/I/Q)-X-X-(L/V/I/H)-(L/S/G/A)-X-(H/Q)-(L/A) for the most common PTS2 variants and (R/K)-(L/V/I/Q)-X-X-(L/V/I/H/Q)-(L/S/G/A/K)-X-(H/Q)-(L/A/F) comprising essentially all known possibilities (11.Petriv O.I.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PTS2 has to form an α-helical conformation, in which all important residues orient their side chains in the same direction and that a flexible linker domain connects the PTS2-helix with the core protein to expose the signal properly (10.Kunze M.

The PTS2 receptor PEX7 belongs to the family of seven-bladed WD-40 repeat proteins, which share a characteristic shape (12.van der Voorn L. Ploegh H.L. The WD-40 repeat.FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).

In this model, two evolutionary conserved glutamate residues (Glu-113, Glu-200) are part of the binding groove and charge-inverting substitutions of these residues interfere with cargo binding, whereas a third similarly conserved glutamate (Glu-287) is proximal to the binding groove but its mutation retains cargo binding (10.Kunze M.

This model for the human PEX7-cargo interaction has recently been corroborated by resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the yeast ScPex7p bound to a PTS2-carrying cargo protein, which shows a virtually identical binding mode (16.Pan D.

The transport of PEX7-cargo complexes to the peroxisomal surface is exerted by additional proteins summarized as co-receptors.

Sowinski S. Kunau W.H. Schliebs W.

In mammalian PEX5 this domain is encoded by an independent exon that is facultatively omitted by alternative splicing giving rise to a long and short isoform of PEX5 (PEX5L and PEX5S), whereas in plants the short isoform occurs only in rice (24.Lee J.R.

Furthermore, all co-receptors harbor sequences for docking at the peroxisomal membrane and further integration (25.Kerssen D. Hambruch E. Klaas W. Platta H.W. de Kruijff B. Erdmann R. Kunau W.H.

From this perspective, PEX7 exerts a bridging function that links various cargo proteins harboring a PTS2 signal with the co-receptor protein such as PEX5L that mediates transport and receptor recycling. Thus, PTS2-carrying proteins are imported by a piggyback-like mechanism that has been amply demonstrated in peroxisomal protein import (29.Glover J.R. Andrews D.W. Rachubinski R.A.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1245-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), whereby PEX7 acts as platform to handle diverse proteins. The subsequent translocation of PTS2-carrying cargo proteins across the peroxisomal membrane is mechanistically still enigmatic, but most likely resembles the better understood import of PTS1-carrying proteins (32.Girzalsky W. Saffian D. Erdmann R. Peroxisomal protein translocation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 724-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present work we use a modified application of the mammalian two-hybrid assay to reveal the counterwise stabilizing effect of cargo and co-receptor binding to PEX7 on the stability of the trimeric complex. Thereby, we provide evidence that in PTS2-mediated protein import the interaction between PEX7 and cargo protein is a prerequisite for co-receptor binding, which reciprocally stabilizes the receptor-cargo interaction and initiates transfer of this complex to peroxisomes.

Cells were cultivated in DMEM (COS7) or RPMI1640 (fibroblasts) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (BioWhittaker). For transfection cells were incubated with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions using Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) or electroporation. 32–48 h after transfection, cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were washed, permeabilized (5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS), and blocked in blocking solution (PBS with 10% FCS and 5% bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science)). After incubation with primary antibodies from different species (rabbit, α-PMP70 (1:2000, ABR); mouse, α-EGFP (1:800, Roche Applied Science)), slides were washed with PBS several times and exposed to compatible secondary antibodies (Cy2- and Cy3-labeled goat α-rabbit IgG and goat α-mouse IgG, 1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Finally, cells were mounted in PBS/glycerol (1:9) with 3% DABCO (Sigma). For microscopic analysis the invert microscope IX71 equipped with a CCD camera (CAM-XM10) and an appropriate filter set was used together with analysis and C-M-cell software (Olympus). During the analysis of subcellular distribution, cells that showed extremely high expression levels were avoided, because in these usually a cytosolic distribution of the reporter protein was observed, probably due to saturation of the PTS2-dependent import pathway. The expression plasmid pcDNA3.1_zeo-PEX5L was cloned by excising the ORF of PEX5L from pCD2 (PEX5L-IRES-EGFP-SKL, kindly provided by Marc Fransen, Leuven, Belgium) using restriction enzymes BglII/SalI and inserting this DNA fragment into pcDNA3.1_zeo that had been linearized using BamHI and XhoI. PTS2thiolase (RS1E)-EGFP was generated by digesting the reporter protein lacking a PTS2 signal (PTS2-tester) (10.Kunze M. Neuberger G. Maurer-Stroh S. Ma J. Eck T. Braverman N. Schmid J.A.

GAL4DBD-HA-PEX5L (pM-HA-PEX5L) was obtained by combining (i) the vector backbone of the empty plasmid pM digested with SalI and NdeI, (ii) a pM variant containing an additional HA tag behind the GAL4-DBD digested with NdeI and BamHI, and (iii) the ORF of PEX5L obtained by digestion of CD2 with BglII/SalI.

GAL4DBD-PEX7 was generated by digesting empty plasmid pM with EcoRI and XbaI and ligating with the ORF of PEX7 that was obtained by excision from expression plasmid myc-PEX7 (10.Kunze M. Neuberger G.

Variants of GAL4DBD-PEX7 were obtained by the same procedure using ORFs from myc-HsPEX7 variants using plasmids encoding the corresponding mutations (plasmids are listed in supplemental Table S1). COS7 cells were transfected in 24-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (1.5 μl of Lipofectamine) with the following plasmids: 0.1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid pFR-Luc (Stratagene) and 0.05 μg of pCMV-β-Gal (P204, Promega) for normalization were combined with the appropriate combination of either (i) for 2 plasmids of 0.35 μg of bait (GAL4DBD encoding plasmids) and 0.35 μg of prey (VP16AD encoding plasmids) or (ii) for 3 plasmids with each 0.23 μg of bait, 0.23 μg of prey, and 0.23 μg of expression vector. After 48 h, the cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with 50 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 0.5% Triton X-100, cOmplete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 20 min. The extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 15,300 × g, and the supernatant was measured. The luciferase assay was performed according to the protocol of the MatchmakerTM system (Clontech) using the pRF-Luc vector (Stratagene) as reporter plasmid for the detection of interaction by luminescence-based luciferase activity measurements (SynergyH4 reader; BioTek) and using plasmid pCMV-β-Gal for normalization of transfection efficiency by measuring β-galactosidase activity (34.Sughra K.

In the predicted structure of human PEX7, a highly conserved glutamate residue at position 287 is located in proximity to the PTS2-binding groove (Fig. 1A) and the charge-inverting mutation E287R reduced the affinity of PEX7 to the cargo protein, although binding was retained (10.Kunze M. Neuberger G. Maurer-Stroh S. Ma J. Eck T. Braverman N. Schmid J.A. Eisenhaber F. Berger J. Structural requirements for interaction of peroxisomal targeting signal 2 and its receptor PEX7.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 45048-45062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This raised the question, whether a PEX7 variant harboring this mutation is functional and able to compensate for PEX7 deficiency. Thus, we cotransfected human skin fibroblasts obtained from a healthy human subject (Fig. 1B) or from an RCDP1 patient lacking functional PEX7 (Fig. 1, C–E) with the PTS2-reporter protein (PTS2thiolase-EGFP) and either an empty vector (Fig. 1, B and C), an expression plasmid encoding myc-tagged human PEX7 (myc-PEX7) (Fig. 1D) or a variant thereof harboring the E287R mutation (myc-PEX7E287R) (Fig. 1E). In cells transfected with the empty plasmid the reporter protein appeared punctate in cells from the healthy person and colocalized with the peroxisomal marker protein PMP70 (Fig. 1B), whereas in cells from the RCDP1 patient the protein was evenly distributed across the cell (Fig. 1C). In cells from an RCDP1 patient expressing myc-PEX7 the reporter protein showed a punctate staining pattern colocalizing with the peroxisomal marker PMP70 indicating peroxisomal import (Fig. 1D), but in cells expressing the mutated myc-PEX7E287R form the reporter protein was again evenly distributed across the cell (Fig. 1E). This demonstrates that the E287R mutation destroys the ability of PEX7 to restore PTS2-mediated import in RCDP1 cells although cargo binding is retained in this PEX7 variant. Because the transport of cargo-loaded PEX7 to the surface of peroxisomes requires interaction between PEX7 and the long isoform of PEX5 (PEX5L), we hypothesized that the E287R mutation interferes with the binding to PEX5L. Thus, we tested the interaction between PEX7 and PEX5L in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. When COS7 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding PEX5L fused to the C terminus of the VP16-activation domain (prey) (VP16AD-PEX5L) and PEX7 fused to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain (bait) (GAL4DBD-PEX7) together with a luciferase reporter plasmid (five copies of the GAL4-binding element in front of luciferase, UAS5xGAL4-BE-luciferase) and a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid for normalization, we obtained a significant and specific increase in the relative luciferase activity compared with controls indicating a specific interaction between the proteins (Fig. 1F). However, when VP16AD-PEX5L was cotransfected with the PEX7 variant harboring the E287R mutation the reporter protein activity was comparable with the background level suggesting that an interaction between the proteins does not occur (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that the E287R mutation interferes with the interaction between receptor and co-receptor and, thus, the inability of PEX7E287R to restore PTS2-mediated import is caused by a defect in peroxisomal transport of the receptor. To confirm the reduced interaction between PEX7E287R and the prototypic cargo protein (PTS2thiolase-EGFP) relative to native PEX7, we again performed a mammalian two-hybrid assay using GAL4DBD-PEX7 and VP16AD-PTS2thiolase-EGFP, thus inverting bait and prey compared with our previous work (10.Kunze M.

However, clinical data regarding the HPV infection rate among LSCC patients remain largely inconsistent. Methods In total, 674 LSCC patients from three major hospitals in Shanghai were enrolled in this study. We determined the patients' HPV infection status using immunohistochemistry and the GenoArray HPV genotyping assay and calculated their long-term survival rate using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results The total P16-positive rate according to immunostaining results was 7.57% (51/674). None of the P16-negative patients were HPV-positive according to the HPV genotyping test. The rate of HPV infection among patients with LSCC was 4.9% (33/674). HPV infection was more common among nonsmokers (P<0.05), nondrinkers (P<0.05), and patients with supraglottic LSCC (P<0.05). Of the 33 HPV-positive patients, 28 (84.8%) were infected with HPV-16, 2 with HPV-18, 1 with HPV-31, 1 with HPV-33 and 1 with HPV-45. The 3-year overall survival rate and progression-free survival rate were higher in HPV-positive than HPV-negative patients, but the difference was not statistically significant (76.3% vs. 70.7%, P = 0.30 and 65.1% vs. 58.3%, P = 0.37, respectively). Conclusion HPV was not a main causal factor in LSCC carcinogenesis in this Chinese population. HPV infection did not alter patients' overall survival or progression-free survival rates in this study."

Of all the prostaglandins (PGE1, PGE2, PGF2α, and PGI2) and leukotrienes (LTD4 and LTE4) tested; PGE1, PGE2 and LTD4 inhibited the growth of IMR-32 cells to a significant degree at the highest doses used. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4), 19,20-dihydroxydocosapentaenoate (19, 20 DiHDPA) and 10(S),17(S)-dihydroxy-4Z,7Z,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid (protectin: 10(S),17(S)DiHDoHE), metabolites of DHA, significantly inhibited the growth of IMR-32 cells. Pre-treatment with AA, GLA, DGLA and EPA and simultaneous treatment with all PUFAs used in the study augmented growth inhibitory action of bleomycin. Surprisingly, both indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) at 60 and 20 µg/ml respectively enhanced the growth of IMR-32 cells even in the presence of bleomycin. AA enhanced oxidant stress in IMR-32 cells as evidenced by an increase in lipid peroxides, superoxide dismutase levels and glutathione peroxidase activity. These results suggest that PUFAs suppress growth of human neuroblastoma cells, augment growth inhibitory action of bleomycin by enhancing formation of lipid peroxides and altering the status of anti-oxidants and, in all probability, increase the formation of lipoxins, resolvins and protectins from their respective precursors that possess growth inhibitory actions."
https://openalex.org/W2046812745,"Schwann cells are an important cell source for regenerative therapy for neural disorders. We investigated the role of the transcription factor sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 10 (SOX10) in the proliferation and myelination of Schwann cells. SOX10 is predominantly expressed in rat sciatic nerve-derived Schwann cells and is induced shortly after birth. Among transcription factors known to be important for the differentiation of Schwann cells, SOX10 potently transactivates the S100B promoter. In cultures of Schwann cells, overexpressing SOX10 dramatically induces S100B expression, while knocking down SOX10 with shRNA suppresses S100B expression. Here, we identify three core response elements of SOX10 in the S100B promoter and intron 1 with a putative SOX motif. Knockdown of either SOX10 or S100B enhances the proliferation of Schwann cells. In addition, using dissociated cultures of dorsal root ganglia, we demonstrate that suppressing S100B with shRNA impairs myelination of Schwann cells. These results suggest that the SOX10-S100B signaling axis critically regulates Schwann cell proliferation and myelination, and therefore is a putative therapeutic target for neuronal disorders."

In this study, one rice population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used to determine the genetic characteristics of seed vigor, including the germination potential, germination rate, germination index and time for 50% of germination, at 4 (early), 5 (middle) and 6 weeks (late) after heading in two years. A total of 24 additive and 9 epistatic quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed vigor were identified using QTL Cartographer and QTLNetwork program respectively in 2012; while 32 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers associated with seed vigor were detected using bulked segregant analysis (BSA) in 2013. The additive, epistatic and QTL × development interaction effects regulated the dry maturity developmental process to improve seed vigor in rice. The phenotypic variation explained by each additive, epistatic QTL and QTL × development interaction ranged from 5.86 to 40.67%, 4.64 to 11.28% and 0.01 to 1.17%, respectively. The QTLs were rarely co-localized among the different maturity stages; more QTLs were expressed at the early maturity stage followed by the late and middle stages. Twenty additive QTLs were stably expressed in two years which might play important roles in establishment of seed vigor in different environments. By comparing chromosomal positions of these stably expressed additive QTLs with those previously identified, the regions of QTL for seed vigor are likely to coincide with QTL for grain size, low temperature germinability and seed dormancy; while 5 additive QTL might represent novel genes. Using four selected RILs, three cross combinations of seed vigor for the development of RIL populations were predicted; 19 elite alleles could be pyramided by each combination."

Conclusion: Zeppo2 plays a role in mammary gland homeostasis. Significance: Deregulation of Zeppo2 could result in breast cancer development. Proper embryogenesis relies on the strict regulation of key transcriptional regulatory genes. Recently, the members of the NET subfamily of zinc finger proteins that are related to the Sp family of transcription factors have been identified as important regulators during development. In particular, ZNF503/Zeppo2 (zinc finger elbow-related proline domain protein 2, Zpo2/Nolz1/Zfp503) is a regulatory factor that is conserved across many species. In Drosophila, elbow, a protein closely related to ZPO2, serves as a transcriptional repressor that is involved in tracheal development (1Dorfman R. Glazer L. Weihe U. Wernet M.F. Shilo B.Z. Elbow and Noc define a family of zinc finger proteins controlling morphogenesis of specific tracheal branches.Development. 2002; 129: 3585-3596PubMed Google Scholar).

Although Zpo1 plays a significant role in mammary gland homeostasis, little is known about the role of Zpo2 in the mammary gland. In this report, we demonstrate that ZPO2 is a transcriptional repressor that is expressed in a diverse array of tissues, including the mammary gland. We show that, in mammary epithelial cells, ZPO2 regulates cellular migration and proliferation. Moreover, Zpo2 expression is up-regulated during breast cancer progression, and overexpression of Zpo2 leads to higher tumor seeding in recipient lungs during mammary tumor transplant experiments.

MMTV-PyMT mammary tumor cells were cultured in DME-H21 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For three-dimensional Matrigel cultures, EpH4.9 or PyMT cells were placed in low-adhesion plates to form aggregates. The larger aggregates were broken into smaller aggregates by pipetting several times, and the aggregates were separated to form single cells by gravity. The cell aggregates were resuspended in cold Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and plated in 50-μl 12-well plates.

To sort primary mouse mammary epithelial cells into basal and luminal fractions, mammary glands from adult virgin female mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f, CD24, and lineage markers (CD45, CD31, and Ter119) (eBioscience, catalog nos. 17-0495-82, 48-0242-82, 12-0451, 11-0311-85, and 11-5921-82, respectively). Analysis and cell sorting were performed on a LSRII instrument (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar) and FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). The Rac1/Cdc42 activation assay kit (Millipore) was used to measure RAC1 activity in EpH4.9 cell lysates. 1 × 104 control or Zpo2-overexpressing MMTV-PyMT tumor cells were transplanted into 6 week-old syngeneic FVB female mice via tail vein injection. 6 weeks post-transplant, the animals were harvested, and the lungs were analyzed for tumor seeding. We first examined Zpo2 expression in normal mouse embryos. Whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that Zpo2 expression in mammary placodes was evident as early as embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and was clearly detectable by E13.5 (Fig. 1A). We also detected Zpo2 expression in embryonic lung and kidney (Fig. 1B). Zpo2 expression persisted in adult mammary epithelial cells. We fractionated basal and luminal mammary epithelial cells from 6-week-old female mice using FACS (Fig. 2, A and B) and examined Zpo2 expression via qRT-PCR (Fig. 2C). Zpo2 mRNA was expressed in both mammary basal and luminal epithelial compartments. However, Zpo2 was more abundant in basal cells compared with luminal cells (Fig. 2C). To validate our findings in human breast tissue, we utilized the Human Protein Atlas database to examine Zpo2 expression in adult mammary glands. On the basis of histological analysis provided by the Human Protein Atlas database, Zpo2 expression was apparent in both mammary epithelial compartments with higher levels in the basal cell layer than the luminal cell compartment. We also examined ZPO1 expression via the Human Protein Atlas database. Interestingly, unlike Zpo2, Zpo1 expression was detected equally in both mammary cell compartments. In addition to the mammary gland, ZPO2 expression was also present in other tissues. The Human Protein Atlas database indicated a high or medium Zpo2 expression level in 52 of 81 analyzed adult tissues, including lung, kidney, and intestine. Overall, these observations suggest that Zpo2 may play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis because its expression initiates during development and continues through adulthood in most tissues, including the mammary gland. To investigate a functional role for Zpo2 in mammary epithelial cells, we first determined its cellular localization. Immunostaining for endogenous ZPO2 in EpH4.9 cells indicated that ZPO2 is strictly targeted to the nucleus (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, analysis of the Zpo2 sequence suggests that Zpo2 lacks a bona fide nuclear localization signal. Therefore, we examined the protein domain(s) required for nuclear targeting of ZPO2. Similar to the mammalian ZPO1 and the ZPO2 ortholog in zebrafish Nlz2 (12Runko A.P. Sagerström C.G. Isolation of nlz2 and characterization of essential domains in Nlz family proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11917-11925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), ZPO2 contains an Sp-box domain on the N terminus and a single Zn2+ finger domain, followed by a proline-tyrosine (PT)-rich domain in the C-terminal region (Fig. 2E). We generated several truncated V5-tagged Zpo2 constructs and examined the cellular localization of the expressed proteins. Although full-length V5-tagged ZPO2 clearly localized to the nucleus, the Zpo2 construct lacking the PT domain in the C terminus failed to localize to the nucleus and appeared cytoplasmic (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that the C-terminal domain plays a pivotal role in nuclear localization of ZPO2. Transcriptional repression by the NET subfamily of zinc finger proteins may be mediated through its interaction with the corepressor Groucho (Grg) (1Dorfman R. Glazer L. Weihe U. Wernet M.F. Shilo B.Z. Elbow and Noc define a family of zinc finger proteins controlling morphogenesis of specific tracheal branches.Development. 2002; 129: 3585-3596PubMed Google Scholar, 12Runko A.P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11917-11925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Analysis of the ZPO2 protein sequence suggests a predicted Grg4 binding site on the N terminus flanking the Sp-Box protein domain. Therefore, a potential interaction between ZPO2 and GRG4 could promote transcriptional repression activity by ZPO2 in mammary cells. We found that Grg4 is expressed in the developing mammary gland (5Slorach E.M. Chou J. Werb Z. Zeppo1 is a novel metastasis promoter that represses E-cadherin expression and regulates p120-catenin isoform expression and localization.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 471-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and this prompted us to further investigate whether ZPO2 and GRG4 interact in mouse mammary epithelial cells. Co-IP of V5-tagged Zpo2 and FLAG-tagged Grg4 in EpH4.9 lysates followed by Western blot analysis using ZPO2 and GRG4 antibodies indicated that ZPO2 and GRG4 exist in a complex (Fig. 2F). Additionally, to demonstrate transcriptional activity of ZPO2, we generated a DNA construct containing full-length Zpo2 coupled to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Zpo2-Gal4). We examined the effect of Zpo2-Gal4 on gene expression using a GAL4-luciferase reporter gene in mammary EpH4.9 cells. We observed that increasing levels of Zpo2-Gal4 reduced the reporter activity, suggesting that ZPO2 functions as a transcriptional repressor in mammary cells (Fig. 2G). To identify the protein domain(s) responsible for transcriptional repression, we generated several truncated versions of Zpo2 coupled to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Reporter analysis using the GAL4-luciferase system indicated that Zpo2 possesses two transcriptional regulatory domains (Fig. 3), one at the N terminus and the second at the C terminus. Both the N-terminal Sp-box domain (Zpo2 construct 3, ΔZn2+ finger ΔPT rich) and the C-terminal PT rich domain (Zpo2 construct 11, PT-rich domain) were individually sufficient to diminish the luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 3). Our previous studies indicated that Zpo1 enhances cellular motility in mammary epithelial cells (5Slorach E.M. Chou J. Werb Z. Zeppo1 is a novel metastasis promoter that represses E-cadherin expression and regulates p120-catenin isoform expression and localization.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 471-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether Zpo2 exerts similar effects on the mammary cells. To gain insight into the effect of Zpo2 expression on cellular behavior in mammary epithelial cells, we generated EpH4.9 and MMTV-PyMT (PyMT) cell lines that stably expressed full-length Zpo2 or Zpo2-shRNA (shZpo2). The expression level of Zpo2 in EpH4.9 and PyMT stable lines was verified by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4, A–D). To evaluate whether Zpo2 enhances cell motility in mammary epithelial cells, we performed scratch assays. Zpo2-overexpressing cells were significantly more motile than the control cells (Fig. 4, E and G). The Zpo2-expressing cells were able to close the gap between the two invading fronts more efficiently than the control cells. Conversely, knockdown of Zpo2 slowed the migration of cells, and the invading fronts did not close the gaps as efficiently as the control cells (Fig. 4, F and H). Moreover, to further validate the effect of Zpo2 on cell motility and migration, we performed three-dimensional culture assays. We placed aggregates of control and Zpo2-overexpressing cells in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures and examined their colony morphology. Although non-tumorigenic EpH4.9 control cells were non-invasive and formed tight spherical colonies, Zpo2-overexpressing cells were very invasive and dispersed throughout the Matrigel matrix 7 days post-seeding (Fig. 5A). Conversely, targeted knockdown of Zpo2 inhibited the invasive phenotype, and shZpo2 cells formed colonies that were significantly more compact than the control cells 7 days post-seeding (Fig. 5A). PyMT mammary tumor cells are highly invasive, and, 7 days post-seeding, the control cells form many invading processes through the Matrigel matrix. However, overexpression of Zpo2 in PyMT cells expedited the invasive phenotype. Within 3 days post-seeding, the Zpo2-overexpressing PyMT cells demonstrated the full invasive phenotype through the Matrigel matrix (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, down-regulation of Zpo2 completely inhibited the cellular motility, and the colonies failed to demonstrate the invasive phenotype (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that Zpo2 promotes cellular invasion and migration. We next asked whether altered cell-cell adhesion contributed to the effects of Zpo2 on cellular migration. Activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK/PTK2) and down-regulation of E-cadherin play a pivotal role in initiating cellular migration and metastasis (13Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Focal adhesion kinase: in command and control of cell motility.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar, 14Zhao J. Guan J.L. Signal transduction by focal adhesion kinase in cancer.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2009; 28: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We first examined the activation state of FAK in Zpo2-expressing cells by performing immunostaining using phospho-FAK (pFAK) antibody. Zpo2-overexpressing cells demonstrated high levels of pFAK compared with the control (Fig. 6A). Additionally, Western blot analysis indicated that, in response to Zpo2 expression, both EpH4.9 and PyMT cells increase FAK activity, as demonstrated by higher levels of pFAK staining (Fig. 6B). Conversely, down-regulation of Zpo2 decreased FAK activity, as demonstrated by lower pFAK staining in the Western blot analysis (Fig. 6B). The immunostaining and Western blot analysis suggest a correlation between Zpo2 expression levels and FAK activation in mammary cells. Loss of cell-cell adhesion because of down-regulation of E-cadherin results in cell dispersal (15Behrens J. Mareel M.M. Van Roy F.M. Birchmeier W.

We asked whether higher pFAK staining in cells expressing Zpo2 correlates with reduced E-cadherin levels. Immunostaining for E-cadherin in the EpH4.9 and PyMT stable cell lines indicated a decrease in overall E-cadherin staining in Zpo2-overexpressing cells compared with the control (Fig. 6C). Similarly, Western blot analysis indicated a reduction in E-cadherin expression in Zpo2-expressing cells compared with the control (Fig. 6D). However, down-regulation of Zpo2 via shRNA enhanced E-cadherin levels in both EpH4.9 and PyMT cells, as detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6D). Overall, our data suggest that overexpression of Zpo2 initiates cellular motility in part by activation of FAK and down-regulation of E-cadherin in mammary cells. FAK activation influences the activity of Src family of kinases (SFK) as well as the RhoA GTPases RAC1 and RHOA (19Chang F. Lemmon C.A. Park D. Romer L.H.

Interestingly, overexpression of Zpo2 in EpH4.9 cells up-regulated RAC1 and SFK protein levels and down-regulated the RHOA expression level (Fig. 7A). Moreover, in response to Zpo2 overexpression, RAC1 demonstrated higher activity levels, as detected by presence of more GTP-bound RAC1 species compared with control EpH4.9 cells (Fig. 7A). Next we examined loss of Rac1 or RhoA and the subsequent effect on cellular motility in Zpo2-overexpressing cells. We knocked down Rac1 and RhoA separately in Zpo2-expressing EpH4.9 cells utilizing siRNA-mediated gene silencing (Fig. 7B). Although Rac1 knockdown disrupted Zpo2-induced cellular invasion (Fig. 7C), RhoA knockdown dramatically increased the invasive phenotype exerted by Zpo2 (Fig. 7C). These data suggest that the cellular invasion induced by Zpo2 relies on the activity of RAC1 and inhibition of RHOA. Western blot analysis indicated that Zpo2 up-regulates SFK expression levels. Because SFKs regulate Rho GTPase activity, we also inhibited SFK activity and examined cellular invasion in EpH4.9-Zpo2 cells. Inhibition of SFK by SU6656 also disrupted cellular invasion in Zpo2-expressing cells (Fig. 7D). Overall, our data indicate that Zpo2 promotes cellular migration through activation of FAK and down-regulation of E-cadherin. Moreover, cellular motility induced by Zpo2 is SFK/RAC1-dependent. To determine whether Zpo2 influences the proliferative state of mammary epithelial cells, we first examined candidate cell cycle-associated gene expression levels in response to Zpo2 expression. Induction of Zpo2 in EpH4.9 cells increased cyclin D2 and cyclin E levels, as indicated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 8A). We also examined the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) Cdk1 and Cdk2. qRT-PCR analysis of T47D cells indicated that Zpo2 expression elevates Cdk1 and Cdk2 levels compared with control cells (Fig. 8B). Additionally, Zpo2-overexpressing cells showed a 40-fold increase in Ki67 levels by qRT-PCR, whereas targeted knockdown of Zpo2 via shRNA significantly reduced Ki67 levels (Fig. 8C). Moreover, immunostaining analysis for phospho-histone H3 (pH3) indicated that Zpo2 indeed increased proliferation in EpH4.9 and PyMT cells (Fig. 8, D and E). Collectively, our data demonstrate that Zpo2 promotes mammary cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2504175247,"Background In resource constrained settings, immunological assessment through CD4 count is used to assess response to first line Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). In this study, we aim to investigate factors associated with immunological treatment failure. Methods A matched case-control study design was used. Cases were subjects who already experienced immunological treatment failure and controls were those without immunological failure after an exactly or approximately equivalent duration of first line treatment with cases. Data were analyzed using SPSS v16.0. Conditional logistic regression was carried out. Results A total of 134 cases and 134 controls were included in the study. At baseline, the mean age ±1 SD of cases was 37.5±9.7 years whereas it was 36.9±9.2 years among controls. The median baseline CD4 counts of cases and controls were 121.0 cells/µl (IQR: 47–183 cells/µl) and 122.0 cells/µl (IQR: 80.0–189.8 cells/µl), respectively. The median rate of CD4 cells increase was comparable for the two groups in the first six months of commencing HAART (P = 0.442). However, the median rate of CD4 increase was significantly different for the two groups in the next 6 months period (M6 to M12). The rate of increment was 8.8 (IQR: 0.5, 14.6) and 1.8 (IQR: 8.8, 11.3) cells/µl/month for controls and cases, respectively (Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.003). In conditional logistic regressions grouped baseline CD4 count (P = 0.028), old age group and higher educational status (P<0.001) were significant predictors of immunological treatment failure. Conclusion Subjects with immunological treatment failure have an optimal rate of immunological recovery in the first 6 months of treatment with first line HAART, but relative to the non-failing group the rate declines at a later period, notably between 6 and 12 months. Low baseline CD4 count, old age and higher educational status were associated with immunological treatment failure."
https://openalex.org/W2043908442,"Streptococcus mutans, a major acidogenic component of the dental plaque biofilm, has a key role in caries etiology. Previously, we demonstrated that the VicRK two-component signal transduction system modulates biofilm formation, oxidative stress and acid tolerance responses in S. mutans. Using in vitro phosphorylation assays, here we demonstrate for the first time, that in addition to activating its cognate response regulator protein, the sensor kinase, VicK can transphosphorylate a non-cognate stress regulatory response regulator, GcrR, in the presence of manganese. Manganese is an important micronutrient that has been previously correlated with caries incidence, and which serves as an effector of SloR-mediated metalloregulation in S. mutans. Our findings supporting regulatory effects of manganese on the VicRK, GcrR and SloR, and the cross-regulatory networks formed by these components are more complex than previously appreciated. Using DNaseI footprinting we observed overlapping DNA binding specificities for VicR and GcrR in native promoters, consistent with these proteins being part of the same transcriptional regulon. Our results also support a role for SloR as a positive regulator of the vicRK two component signaling system, since its transcription was drastically reduced in a SloR-deficient mutant. These findings demonstrate the regulatory complexities observed with the S. mutans manganese-dependent response, which involves cross-talk between non-cognate signal transduction systems (VicRK and GcrR) to modulate stress response pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1972091845,"Although endometriosis is suspected to be a cause of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), the mechanism(s) underlying this process have not been elucidated. Recently, androgens were shown to promote oocyte maturation and to play a role in folliculogenesis. In addition, several reports have documented low testosterone levels in the follicular fluid obtained from endometriosis patients. We therefore examined whether the low levels of serum testosterone are associated with the apoptosis of granulosa cells in follicles obtained from endometriosis patients. Serum samples were collected from 46 patients with endometriosis and from 62 patients without endometriosis who received assisted reproductive therapy. Specimens of the ovaries obtained from 10 patients with endometrioma were collected using laparoscopy. The mean serum testosterone concentration in the patients with endometriosis was significantly lower than that observed in the patients without endometriosis. Furthermore, high expression of a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 member, BimEL, in the follicles was found to be associated with a low serum testosterone level. We clarified the underlying mechanisms using a basic approach employing human immortalized granulosa cells derived from a primary human granulosa cell tumor, the COV434 cell line. The in vitro examination demonstrated that testosterone inhibited apoptosis induced by sex steroids depletion via the PI3K/Akt-FoxO3a pathway in the COV434 cells. In conclusion, we elucidated the mechanism underlying the anti-apoptotic effects of testosterone on granulosa cells, and found that a low-testosterone status is a potentially important step in the development of premature ovarian insufficiency in patients with endometriosis."
https://openalex.org/W2021834212,"Lead (Pb) is found to impair cognitive function. Synaptic structural plasticity is considered to be the physiological basis of synaptic functional plasticity and has been recently found to play important roles in learning and memory. To study the effect of Pb on spatial learning and memory at different developmental stages, and its relationship with alterations of synaptic structural plasticity, postnatal rats were randomly divided into three groups: Control; Pre-weaning Pb (Parents were exposed to 2 mM PbCl2 3 weeks before mating until weaning of pups); Post-weaning Pb (Weaned pups were exposed to 2 mM PbCl2 for 9 weeks). The spatial learning and memory of rats was measured by Morris water maze (MWM) on PND 85–90. Rat pups in Pre-weaning Pb and Post-weaning Pb groups performed significantly worse than those in Control group (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the performance of MWM between the two Pb-exposure groups. Before MWM (PND 84), the number of neurons and synapses significantly decreased in Pre-weaning Pb group, but not in Post-weaning Pb group. After MWM (PND 91), the number of synapses in Pre-weaning Pb group increased significantly, but it was still less than that of Control group (p<0.05); the number of synapses in Post-weaning Pb group was also less than that of Control group (p<0.05), although the number of synapses has no differences between Post-weaning Pb and Control groups before MWM. In both Pre-weaning Pb and Post-weaning Pb groups, synaptic structural parameters such as thickness of postsynaptic density (PSD), length of synaptic active zone and synaptic curvature increased significantly while width of synaptic cleft decreased significantly compared to Control group (p<0.05). Our data demonstrated that both early and late developmental Pb exposure impaired spatial learning and memory as well as synaptic structural plasticity in Wistar rats."

Structure and mechanism of DNA polymerases.Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 401-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The first step involves binding of the enzyme to the DNA, and the second step is the binding of a dNTP and two metal ions into the active site of the enzyme. The third step involves a conformational change from an open to a closed state that aligns the incoming dNTP, the 3′-OH of the nascent DNA strand, and the metal ions in a precise arrangement to allow phosphodiester bond formation. Following the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the growing DNA chain, a second conformational change occurs that allows for the release of pyrophosphate. The length of the DNA strand has now increased by one nucleotide. The DNA polymerase can either remain bound to the DNA and continue synthesis (called “processive synthesis”) or dissociate from the DNA and then bind again for the next nucleotide incorporation (called “distributive synthesis”) (9Goodman M.F.

The eukaryotic B-family polymerases are composed of several subunits. Yeast Pol ϵ consists of four subunits, Pol2, Dpb2, Dpb3, and Dpb4 (10Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A.

Pol2 can be further divided into two domains, the N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain that interacts with Dpb2, Dpb3, and Dpb4. The catalytic domain of Pol2 contains the polymerase site for synthesizing DNA and a 3′–5′ exonuclease site that is responsible for proofreading the newly synthesized DNA (12Budd M.E. Sitney K.C.

We will refer to the catalytic domain (amino acids 1–1228) as Pol2core and to the holoenzyme with all four subunits as Pol ϵ for the remainder of this work. The recently solved high resolution structure of Pol2core (amino acids 1–1228) revealed a domain that is not found among other DNA polymerases (13Hogg M. Osterman P. Bylund G.O. Ganai R.A.

This so-called P domain allows Pol ϵ to encircle double-stranded DNA as the DNA leaves the polymerase active site, and this domain was shown to be important for the processivity and polymerase activity of Pol2core. Pol ϵ replicates DNA with high fidelity. In general, it has been shown that the fidelity of replicative DNA polymerases is determined by three factors: the selection of correct nucleotides at the polymerase active site, the low likelihood to extend a mismatch, and the ability to excise the mismatch in the exonuclease site if incorporated. In vitro studies of Pol ϵ have suggested that the exonuclease activity increases the fidelity by 100-fold or more (14Shcherbakova P.V. Pavlov Y.I. Chilkova O. Rogozin I.B. Johansson E. Kunkel T.A.

The exonuclease and polymerase rates for yeast Pol ϵ have not yet been reported. In order to better understand the mechanism of DNA synthesis by Pol ϵ, it is important to determine its various kinetic rate constants. This will expand our knowledge of how Pol ϵ maintains high fidelity and processivity inside the cell. In addition, the C-terminal domain of Pol2 and the three accessory subunits have previously been implicated in checkpoint activation, initiation of DNA replication, positioning of Pol ϵ on the leading strand, processive DNA synthesis, and replication fidelity (21Navas T.A.

The processivity of Pol ϵ is likely to be influenced by amino acids located in the thumb domain and palm domains, the P domain, the Dpb3 and Dpb4 subunits, interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, interactions with the CMG complex (the replicative helicase), and dNTP concentrations. However, the relative contributions of the different determinants are still unclear. In this work, we have explored the kinetic mechanisms of DNA synthesis by yeast Pol ϵ and yeast Pol2core to ask if the C terminus and the accessory subunits influence the exonuclease and polymerase rates and/or the loading of yeast Pol ϵ. We found that Pol ϵ has high polymerization and exonuclease rates as would be expected from a replicative polymerase. We also found that the C terminus and the accessory subunits do not influence the catalytic rates but do influence the processivity of polymerization and facilitate the loading of yeast Pol ϵ onto the DNA. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol ϵ exo−, Pol2core exo− (amino acids 1–1228), and Pol2core (amino acids 1–1228) were tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST tag) at the N terminus and purified as described (13Hogg M.

The exonuclease-deficient variants, Pol ϵ exo− and Pol2core exo−, carry two amino acid substitutions, D290A and E292A, that are present in the previously studied pol2-4 allele (28Morrison A. Bell J.B. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. Eukaryotic DNA polymerase amino acid sequence required for 3′–5′ exonuclease activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 9473-9477Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Pol ϵ was purified by conventional chromatography as described previously (29Asturias F.J. Cheung I.K. Sabouri N. Chilkova O. Wepplo D. Johansson E. Structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase ϵ by cryo-electron microscopy.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). All variants were expressed under the control of an inducible Gal1-10 galactose promoter in S. cerevisiae strain Py116. Proteins were typically purified from 90–120 liters of yeast grown in glycerol-lactate medium. After a final gel filtration step over a Sephadex 200 column, the purified proteins were concentrated to 5–17 mg/ml in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride, and 800 mm NaAC (pH 7.8). Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany) and gel-purified before use. Primer-template duplexes were prepared by mixing 6 μm primer strand with 7.2 μm template strand in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl, heating to 85 °C for 5 min in a heating block, and slow cooling to room temperature. All experiments were performed on a Rapid Quench QFM-400 (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) in RQ buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 25 °C unless otherwise specified. A reaction mixture containing DNA, enzyme, and RQ buffer was loaded into syringe A, and a reaction mixture containing magnesium acetate, deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), and RQ buffer was loaded in syringe B of the rapid quench machine (specific reaction ingredients and concentrations are described below). Syringe C was loaded with water for washing, and syringe D was loaded with 3 m HCl to quench the reactions. Each time point consisted of mixing 20 μl from syringe A and 20 μl from syringe B in the reaction chamber, allowing the reaction to occur for the preset time, quenching with 20 μl of 3 m HCl, and collecting the reaction products from the exit line. The reaction products were neutralized with 100 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8) and mixed with 150 μl of formamide containing 20 mm EDTA and 0.1% bromphenol blue. A total of 8 μl of this reaction mixture was loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea and 25% formamide in 1× TBE (Tris/borate/EDTA) buffer. The gel was scanned with a Typhoon Scanner 9400 (GE Healthcare) at the Alexa 532-nm setting to excite the fluorophore (tetrachlorofluorescein) that was covalently bound to the 5′-end of the primer DNA. The band intensities were quantified with ImageQuant version 5.2 software (GE Healthcare), and relative intensities were calculated by dividing the intensity of a specific band by the total intensity of all observed bands. The data were analyzed and plotted with GraphPad Prism version 5.01. Exonuclease rates were determined by loading syringe A with 400 nm enzyme, 38 nm DNA, and 1 mm EDTA in RQ buffer and syringe B with 16 mm magnesium acetate in RQ buffer. The final concentrations of reactants were 200 nm enzyme, 19 nm DNA substrate, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 8 mm magnesium acetate. The data were fit to the following equation.

Data were analyzed using the global fit functions in the KinTek software (Kintek Corp.). Syringe A was loaded with 80 nm enzyme in RQ buffer, and syringe B was loaded with 38 nm DNA, 16 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 μm dTTP in RQ buffer.

A preincubated solution of Pol ϵ exo− (65 nm) or Pol2core exo− (65 nm) and the indicated concentrations of 50/80-mer (5–150 nm) was rapidly mixed with a solution containing 100 μm dTTP and magnesium acetate. The reactions were quenched after 50 ms with 3 m HCl, neutralized with Tris-HCl (pH 8), and mixed with formamide dye before loading onto the sequencing gel. The products formed were plotted in the quadratic equation given below (31Zahurancik W.J. Klein S.J. Suo Z.

The concentrations given are final. The high fidelity of Pol ϵ is in part due to its 3′–5′ exonuclease activity, which allows for efficient removal of misincorporated nucleotides (6Morrison A.

To examine the kinetics of the exonuclease reaction and to clarify whether the accessory subunits and/or C terminus of Pol ϵ influence the exonucleolytic removal of the 3′-terminal nucleotide, we used four different substrates: single-stranded DNA, a perfectly primed template, and primer-templates ending with either one or two mispaired nucleotides at the 3′ terminus of the primer (Table 1). Exonuclease rates were determined by preincubating the respective DNA substrate with either saturating concentrations of wild-type Pol2core or Pol ϵ and then initiating the reaction by mixing the enzyme-DNA complexes with Mg2+. Loss of the 3′-nucleotide from single-stranded DNA, primed template, single-mismatched DNA, and double-mismatched DNA was quantified and plotted against time (Fig. 2). The resulting curves were fitted to a biphasic decay equation (Equation 1) with a fast phase and a slow phase. It has previously been suggested that the slow phase is observed due to the primer terminus switching between the exonuclease and polymerase active sites of replicative DNA polymerases or the binding of free polymerase to DNA (32Bloom L.B.

Excising one nucleotide from a single-mismatched and double-mismatched DNA gave a Kfast of 33 and 46 s−1 when excising 61 and 49%, respectively. A correctly paired primer-end was removed at a slower rate, 11 s−1, and only about 33% of the substrate was removed during the fast phase. In contrast to the variation seen for the Kfast, the Kslow was measured to be about 1 s−1 for all four substrates. The fast phase was the major contributor to the exonuclease reaction, so only the rate obtained for the fast phase was considered below.TABLE 2Kinetics of exonucleolytic degradation51TaSingle-stranded DNA.50/80bCorrectly paired primer-template.51T/80cSingle mismatch at 3′-end of primer-template.51TT/80dDouble mismatch at 3′-end of primer-template kfast represents the exonuclease rates of the fast phase, whereas Afast denotes the amplitude of the fast phase.Pol2core kfast (s−1)47 ± 512 ± 365 ± 835 ± 3 Afast (nm)118.812.913.5Pol ϵ kfast (s−1)49 ± 511 ± 233 ± 446 ± 8 Afast (nm)11.66.211.69.3a Single-stranded DNA.b Correctly paired primer-template.c Single mismatch at 3′-end of primer-template.d Double mismatch at 3′-end of primer-template kfast represents the exonuclease rates of the fast phase, whereas Afast denotes the amplitude of the fast phase. Open table in a new tab The observed rate constants for Pol2core and Pol ϵ were comparable except for the removal of a single mismatch in which the rate constant of Pol2core is greater than that of Pol ϵ (Table 2). This difference was not seen when the two last nucleotides in the primer were mismatched. To measure the maximum rate of incorporation by Pol ϵ and the ground state affinity of dTTP for the binary complex of Pol ϵ and DNA (Table 1), we saturated the DNA substrate with enzyme (200 nm Pol ϵ and 19 nm DNA) and started the reaction by the addition of Mg2+ and dTTP ranging in concentration from 0.5 to 500 μm (final concentrations). The amount of product formed was plotted against time using a double-exponential equation with a fast phase and a slow phase for each dTTP concentration (Equation 2). As for the exonuclase reactions, the slower phase is probably observed due to switching of the primer terminus between the polymerase and exonuclease active sites or association of free Pol ϵ with DNA substrate. The single-turnover rates were determined for both the Pol2core exo− and Pol ϵ exo− enzymes (TABLE 3, TABLE 4). The fast phase was the major contributor to the polymerization reaction, and only the rate constants for the fast phase were plotted against dTTP concentration according to Equation 3 to calculate kpol and KddTTP (Fig. 3). The maximum polymerization rate constant (kpol) was ∼352 s−1, and the KddTTP was ∼25 μm for Pol2core exo−, and similar values of kpol ∼319 s−1 and KddTTP ∼21 μm were found for Pol ϵ exo− (Table 5). The similarities in kinetic constants between the two enzymes indicate that the accessory subunits of Pol ϵ do not influence the ground state affinity for dTTP or the maximal rate of polymerization when adding a single nucleotide.TABLE 3kobs obtained at different dTTP concentrations for Pol ϵ exo−dNTP0.5 μm1 μ"
https://openalex.org/W2079959139,"The mechanisms responsible for active DNA demethylation remain elusive in Metazoa. A previous study that utilized zebrafish embryos provided a potent mechanism for active demethylation in which three proteins, AID, MBD4, and GADD45 are involved. We recently found age-dependent DNA hypomethylation in zebrafish, and it prompted us to examine if AID and MBD4 could be involved in the phenomenon. Unexpectedly, however, we found that most of the findings in the previous study were not reproducible. First, the injection of a methylated DNA fragment into zebrafish eggs did not affect either the methylation of genomic DNA, injected methylated DNA itself, or several loci tested or the expression level of aid, which has been shown to play a role in demethylation. Second, aberrant methylation was not observed at certain CpG islands following the injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides against aid and mbd4. Furthermore, we demonstrated that zebrafish MBD4 cDNA lacked a coding region for the methyl-CpG binding domain, which was assumed to be necessary for guidance to target regions. Taken together, we concluded that there is currently no evidence to support the proposed roles of AID and MBD4 in active demethylation in zebrafish embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2031445919,"Speech impairment is one of the most intriguing and least understood effects of alcohol on cognitive function, largely due to the lack of data on alcohol effects on vocalizations in the context of an appropriate experimental model organism. Zebra finches, a representative songbird and a premier model for understanding the neurobiology of vocal production and learning, learn song in a manner analogous to how humans learn speech. Here we show that when allowed access, finches readily drink alcohol, increase their blood ethanol concentrations (BEC) significantly, and sing a song with altered acoustic structure. The most pronounced effects were decreased amplitude and increased entropy, the latter likely reflecting a disruption in the birds’ ability to maintain the spectral structure of song under alcohol. Furthermore, specific syllables, which have distinct acoustic structures, were differentially influenced by alcohol, likely reflecting a diversity in the neural mechanisms required for their production. Remarkably, these effects on vocalizations occurred without overt effects on general behavioral measures, and importantly, they occurred within a range of BEC that can be considered risky for humans. Our results suggest that the variable effects of alcohol on finch song reflect differential alcohol sensitivity of the brain circuitry elements that control different aspects of song production. They also point to finches as an informative model for understanding how alcohol affects the neuronal circuits that control the production of learned motor behaviors."

We found that laforin adopts a dimeric quaternary structure, topologically similar to the prototypical dual specificity phosphatase VH1. The interface between the laforin carbohydrate-binding module and the dual specificity phosphatase domain generates an intimate substrate-binding crevice that allows for recognition and dephosphorylation of phosphomonoesters of glucose.

The interface between the laforin carbohydrate-binding module and the dual specificity phosphatase domain generates an intimate substrate-binding crevice that allows for recognition and dephosphorylation of phosphomonoesters of glucose. We identify novel molecular determinants in the laforin active site that help decipher the mechanism of glucan phosphatase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2171041690,"Progress in control of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is often not uniform, usually due to the effect of one or more sometimes unknown epidemiological factors impairing the success of eradication programs. Use of spatial analysis can help to identify clusters of persistence of disease, leading to the identification of these factors thus allowing the implementation of targeted control measures, and may provide some insights of disease transmission, particularly when combined with molecular typing techniques. Here, the spatial dynamics of bTB in a high prevalence region of Spain were assessed during a three year period (2010-2012) using data from the eradication campaigns to detect clusters of positive bTB herds and of those infected with certain Mycobacterium bovis strains (characterized using spoligotyping and VNTR typing). In addition, the within-herd transmission coefficient (β) was estimated in infected herds and its spatial distribution and association with other potential outbreak and herd variables was evaluated. Significant clustering of positive herds was identified in the three years of the study in the same location (""high risk area""). Three spoligotypes (SB0339, SB0121 and SB1142) accounted for >70% of the outbreaks detected in the three years. VNTR subtyping revealed the presence of few but highly prevalent strains within the high risk area, suggesting maintained transmission in the area. The spatial autocorrelation found in the distribution of the estimated within-herd transmission coefficients in herds located within distances <14 km and the results of the spatial regression analysis, support the hypothesis of shared local factors affecting disease transmission in farms located at a close proximity."
https://openalex.org/W1977648215,"Although radiation therapy is commonly used for treatment for many human diseases including cancer, ionizing radiation produces reactive oxygen species that can damage both cancer and healthy cells. Synthetic triterpenoids, including CDDO-Me, act as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant modulators primarily by inducing the transcription factor Nrf2 to activate downstream genes containing antioxidant response elements (AREs). In the present series of experiments, we determined if CDDO-Me can be used as a radioprotector in normal non-cancerous human lung and breast epithelial cells, in comparison to lung and breast cancer cell lines. A panel of normal non-cancerous, partially cancer progressed, and cancer cell lines from both lung and breast tissue was exposed to gamma radiation with and without pre-treatment with CDDO-Me. CDDO-Me was an effective radioprotector when given ∼18 hours before radiation in epithelial cells (average dose modifying factor (DMF) = 1.3), and Nrf2 function was necessary for CDDO-Me to exert these radioprotective effects. CDDO-Me did not protect cancer lines tested from radiation-induced cytotoxicity, nor did it protect experimentally transformed human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) with progressive oncogenic manipulations. CDDO-Me also protected human lymphocytes against radiation-induced DNA damage. A therapeutic window exists in which CDDO-Me protects normal cells from radiation by activating the Nrf2 pathway, but does not protect experimentally transformed or cancer cell lines. This suggests that use of this oral available, non-toxic class of drug can protect non-cancerous healthy cells during radiotherapy, resulting in better outcomes and less toxicity for patients."
https://openalex.org/W2041904087,"Lipochitin oligosaccharides (LCOs) are signaling molecules required by ecologically and agronomically important bacteria and fungi to establish symbioses with diverse land plants. In plants, oligo-chitins and LCOs can differentially interact with different lysin motif (LysM) receptors and affect innate immunity responses or symbiosis-related pathways. In animals, oligo-chitins also induce innate immunity and other physiological responses but LCO recognition has not been demonstrated. Here LCO and LCO-like compounds are shown to be biologically active in mammals in a structure dependent way through the modulation of angiogenesis, a tightly-regulated process involving the induction and growth of new blood vessels from existing vessels. The testing of 24 LCO, LCO-like or oligo-chitin compounds resulted in structure-dependent effects on angiogenesis in vitro leading to promotion, or inhibition or nil effects. Like plants, the mammalian LCO biological activity depended upon the presence and type of terminal substitutions. Un-substituted oligo-chitins of similar chain lengths were unable to modulate angiogenesis indicating that mammalian cells, like plant cells, can distinguish between LCOs and un-substituted oligo-chitins. The cellular mode-of-action of the biologically active LCOs in mammals was determined. The stimulation or inhibition of endothelial cell adhesion to vitronectin or fibronectin correlated with their pro- or anti-angiogenic activity. Importantly, novel and more easily synthesised LCO-like disaccharide molecules were also biologically active and de-acetylated chitobiose was shown to be the primary structural basis of recognition. Given this, simpler chitin disaccharides derivatives based on the structure of biologically active LCOs were synthesised and purified and these showed biological activity in mammalian cells. Since important chronic disease states are linked to either insufficient or excessive angiogenesis, LCO and LCO-like molecules may have the potential to be a new, carbohydrate-based class of therapeutics for modulating angiogenesis."

Npas4 was localized primarily in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of neurons. The Npas4 protein levels increased in the acute phase of seizures (between 6 h and 72 h) and decreased in the chronic phases (between 7 d and 60 d) in the rat model. Npas4 expression was knocked down by specific siRNA interference. Then, the animals were treated with pilocarpine, and the effects on seizures were evaluated on the 7th day. The onset latencies of pilocarpine-induced seizures were decreased, while the seizure frequency, duration and attack rate increased in these rats. Our study indicates that Npas4 inhibits seizure attacks in pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats."
https://openalex.org/W2076018596,"In the present paper, we have created several novel journal similarity metrics. The MeSH odds ratio measures the topical similarity of any pair of journals, based on the major MeSH headings assigned to articles in MEDLINE. The second metric employed the 2009 Author-ity author name disambiguation dataset as a gold standard for estimating the author odds ratio. This gives a straightforward, intuitive answer to the question: Given two articles in PubMed that share the same author name (lastname, first initial), how does knowing only the identity of the journals (in which the articles were published) predict the relative likelihood that they are written by the same person vs. different persons? The article pair odds ratio detects the tendency of authors to publish repeatedly in the same journal, as well as in specific pairs of journals. The metrics can be applied not only to estimate the similarity of a pair of journals, but to provide novel profiles of individual journals as well. For example, for each journal, one can define the MeSH cloud as the number of other journals that are topically more similar to it than expected by chance, and the author cloud as the number of other journals that share more authors than expected by chance. These metrics for journal pairs and individual journals have been provided in the form of public datasets that can be readily studied and utilized by others."

https://openalex.org/W2016542628,"Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a component of innate and adaptive immune systems implicated in immune, autoimmune responses and in the control of obesity and cancer. NKT cells develop from common CD4+ CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocyte precursors after the rearrangement and expression of T cell receptor (TCR) Vα14-Jα18 gene. Temporal regulation and late appearance of Vα14-Jα18 rearrangement in immature DP thymocytes has been demonstrated. However, the precise control of lifetime of DP thymocytes in vivo that enables distal rearrangements remains incompletely defined. Here we demonstrate that T cell factor (TCF)-1, encoded by the Tcf7 gene, is critical for the extended lifetime of DP thymocytes. TCF-1-deficient DP thymocytes fail to undergo TCR Vα14-Jα18 rearrangement and produce significantly fewer NKT cells. Ectopic expression of Bcl-xL permits Vα14-Jα18 rearrangement and rescues NKT cell development. We report that TCF-1 regulates expression of RORγt, which regulates DP thymocyte survival by controlling expression of Bcl-xL. We posit that TCF-1 along with its cofactors controls the lifetime of DP thymocytes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1991125221,"We tested the hypothesis that pressure-support ventilation (PSV) allows a reduction in emergence time and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) removal time after general anesthesia compared to volume-controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV). Because spontaneous breathing (SB) is often used with LMA under general anesthesia, patients were allocated randomly to three groups (CMV, SB and PSV). Thirty-six consecutive ASA I-II patients scheduled for knee arthroscopic surgery under general anesthesia with a LMA and breathing throughout the ventilator circuit were included. Hemodynamic and ventilatory variables were recorded before and 10-min after general anesthesia-induction, at the surgical incision, at the end of anaesthetic drugs infusion and when the patient was totally awake (which defines emergence time). LMA removal time, drug consumption were recorded at the end of the surgical procedure. Leak fraction around the LMA was also evaluated. LMA removal time was significantly higher in the CMV-group (18 ± 6 min) compared to both SB (8 ± 4 min) and PSV (7 ± 4 min, P < 0.05) groups as well as for emergence time: CMV-group (32 ± 12 min), SB (17 ± 7 min) and PSV (13 ± 6 min, P < 0.05) groups. Total propofol consumption was significantly lower in the PSV-group (610 ± 180 mg) than in both CMV (852 ± 330 mg) and SB (734 ± 246 mg, P < 0.05) groups. Air leaks around the LMA was significantly higher in the CMV-group than in the SB and PSV groups (16% vs 3% and 7%, all P<0.05). In conclusion, in knee arthroscopic surgery, in comparison to CMV, PSV use during general anesthesia in unparalyzed patients decreases LMA removal time, propofol consumption and leaks around LMA while improving ventilatory variables without adverse effects.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN17382426."
https://openalex.org/W2066072335,"Background There are striking differences in breast cancer incidence between Asian and western women. Rates vary substantially within Asia also, with Mongolia's even lower than China's. These profound differences have been speculated to be due in part to diet, mediated by circulating hormone concentrations. Methods Sex steroid hormone concentrations were measured in women living in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and the United Kingdom (U.K.). Diet was obtained by interview and national survey data. Mean hormone differences were compared by country, and systematic variation by number of days since last menstrual period was modeled and adjusted for age and parity; difference in overall area under the curves was assessed. Findings The diet in Mongolia was higher in meat and dairy than in the U.K. Mean testosterone concentrations were 18.5% lower (p<0.0001) while estradiol concentrations were 19.1% higher (p = 0.02) in Mongolian than British women, adjusted for age and parity. Progesterone was almost 50% higher in Mongolian women (p = 0.04), particularly during the follicular phase and early luteal surge. Hormone concentrations generally were similar in Mongolian women born in Ulaanbaatar compared with those born in rural areas, although there was a decreasing progesterone trend by degree of westernization (rural Mongolia; urban Mongolia; U.K.). Mean hormone differences were similar when restricted to parous women, and with further adjustment for body mass index, height, and smoking status. Interpretation These data augment accumulating evidence that circulating estrogens are unlikely to explain reduced breast cancer rates in Asia compared with the west, and suggest casting a wider net with respect to biomarkers. Lower testosterone and higher progesterone in Mongolian women raise the possibility that these hormones may be important to consider. In addition, the almost exclusive dietary reliance of Mongolians on meat and dairy argues against beneficial effects of a low-fat diet on circulating hormones explaining international breast cancer differences."
https://openalex.org/W2094167104,"Background Managing emerging vaccine safety signals during an influenza pandemic is challenging. Federal regulators must balance vaccine risks against benefits while maintaining public confidence in the public health system. Methods We developed a multi-criteria decision analysis model to explore regulatory decision-making in the context of emerging vaccine safety signals during a pandemic. We simulated vaccine safety surveillance system capabilities and used an age-structured compartmental model to develop potential pandemic scenarios. We used an expert-derived multi-attribute utility function to evaluate potential regulatory responses by combining four outcome measures into a single measure of interest: 1) expected vaccination benefit from averted influenza; 2) expected vaccination risk from vaccine-associated febrile seizures; 3) expected vaccination risk from vaccine-associated Guillain-Barre Syndrome; and 4) expected change in vaccine-seeking behavior in future influenza seasons. Results Over multiple scenarios, risk communication, with or without suspension of vaccination of high-risk persons, were the consistently preferred regulatory responses over no action or general suspension when safety signals were detected during a pandemic influenza. On average, the expert panel valued near-term vaccine-related outcomes relative to long-term projected outcomes by 3∶1. However, when decision-makers had minimal ability to influence near-term outcomes, the response was selected primarily by projected impacts on future vaccine-seeking behavior. Conclusions The selected regulatory response depends on how quickly a vaccine safety signal is identified relative to the peak of the pandemic and the initiation of vaccination. Our analysis suggested two areas for future investment: efforts to improve the size and timeliness of the surveillance system and behavioral research to understand changes in vaccine-seeking behavior."

Extensins are believed to form a cross-linked network in the plant cell wall through the tyrosine-derivatives isodityrosine, pulcherosine, and di-isodityrosine. Overexpression of three synthetic genes encoding different elastin-arabinogalactan protein-extensin hybrids in tobacco suspension cultured cells yielded novel cross-linking glycoproteins that shared features of the extensins, arabinogalactan proteins and elastin. The cell wall properties of the three transgenic cell lines were all changed, but in different ways. One transgenic cell line showed decreased cellulose crystallinity and increased wall xyloglucan content; the second transgenic cell line contained dramatically increased hydration capacity and notably increased cell wall biomass, increased di-isodityrosine, and increased protein content; the third transgenic cell line displayed wall phenotypes similar to wild type cells, except changed xyloglucan epitope extractability. These data indicate that overexpression of modified extensins may be a route to engineer plants for bioenergy and biomaterial production."

Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD), a powerful method to study crystal structure and phase changes, was used to detect the glass or ice formation in water, tissue culture medium (TCM)-199, vitrification solution 2 (VS2), and vitrified bovine COCs and morulae. Data revealed Debye's rings and peaks associated with the hexagonal ice crystals at 3.897, 3.635, 3.427, 2.610, 2.241, 1.912 and 1.878 Å in both water and TCM-199, whereas VS2 showed amorphous (glassy) appearance, at 102K (−171°C). An additional peak of sodium phosphate monobasic hydrate (NaH2PO4.H2O) crystals was observed at 2.064 Å in TCM-199 only. All ice and NaH2PO4.H2O peaks were detected in the non-vitrified (control) and vitrified COCs, except two ice peaks (3.145 and 2.655 Å) were absent in the vitrified COCs. The intensities of majority of ice peaks did not differ between the non-vitrified and vitrified COCs. The non-vitrified bovine morulae in TCM-199 demonstrated all ice- and NaH2PO4.H2O-associated Debye's rings and peaks, found in TCM-199 alone. There was no Debye's ring present in the vitrified morulae. In conclusion, SXRD is a powerful method to confirm the vitrifiability of a solution and to detect the glass or ice formation in vitrified cells and tissues. The vitrified bovine COCs exhibited the hexagonal ice crystals instead of glass formation whereas the bovine morulae underwent a typical vitrification."
https://openalex.org/W2049190998,"Determining the location of rare proteins in cells typically requires the use of on-sample amplification. Antibody based recognition and enzymatic amplification is used to produce large amounts of visible label at the site of protein expression, but these techniques suffer from the presence of nonspecific reactivity in the biological sample and from poor spatial control over the label. Polymerization based amplification is a recently developed alternative means of creating an on-sample amplification for fluorescence applications, while not suffering from endogenous labels or loss of signal localization. This manuscript builds upon polymerization based amplification by developing a stable, archivable, and colorimetric mode of amplification termed Polymer Dye Labeling. The basic concept involves an interfacial polymer grown at the site of protein expression and subsequent staining of this polymer with an appropriate dye. The dyes Evans Blue and eosin were initially investigated for colorimetric response in a microarray setting, where both specifically stained polymer films on glass. The process was translated to the staining of protein expression in human dermal fibroblast cells, and Polymer Dye Labeling was specific to regions consistent with desired protein expression. The labeling is stable for over 200 days in ambient conditions and is also compatible with modern mounting medium."

Exclusion criteria: 1) alternate etiologies for increased tone and 2) injection with botulinum toxin within the 6 months preceding the study. Design Single center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with two treatment cycles of 16 weeks. Assessments occurred at 2, 6, 12 and16 weeks following injections. Subjects received up to 300 U of Incobotulinumtoxin A in arm(s). Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures Primary outcome measure was the modified caregiver burden scale (mCBS); exploratory secondary outcome measures were also performed. Analysis of variance and mixed modeling techniques were used to evaluate treatment effects. Results Incobotulinumtoxin A treatment produced significant improvement in mCBS total score −1.11 (–2.04 to −0.18) (Treatment effect and 95% CI), dressing sub-score −0.36 (–0.59 to 0.12), and cleaning under the left and right armpits sub-score −0.5 (–0.96 to −0.04), −0.41 (–0.79 to −0.04) respectively. PROM in the left and right elbow increased by 27.67 degrees (13.32–42.02) and 22.07 degrees (9.76–34.39) respectively. PROM in the left and right shoulder increased by 11.92 degrees (5.46–18.38) and 8.58 degrees (3.73–13.43) respectively. No significant treatment effect was found for GAS, VAS and PAINAD scales or change in time to perform care. No adverse drug reactions occurred.

https://openalex.org/W2028781805,"Human N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (hMPG) initiates base excision repair of a number of structurally diverse purine bases including 1,N6-ethenoadenine, hypoxanthine, and alkylation adducts in DNA. Genetic studies discovered at least eight validated non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) of the hMPG gene in human populations that result in specific single amino acid substitutions. In this study, we tested the functional consequences of these nsSNPs of hMPG. Our results showed that two specific arginine residues, Arg-141 and Arg-120, are important for the activity of hMPG as the germ line variants R120C and R141Q had reduced enzymatic activity in vitro as well as in mammalian cells. Expression of these two variants in mammalian cells lacking endogenous MPG also showed an increase in mutations and sensitivity to an alkylating agent compared with the WT hMPG. Real time binding experiments by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy suggested that these variants have substantial reduction in the equilibrium dissociation constant of binding (KD) of hMPG toward 1,N6-ethenoadenine-containing oligonucleotide (ϵA-DNA). Pre-steady-state kinetic studies showed that the substitutions at arginine residues affected the turnover of the enzyme significantly under multiple turnover condition. Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy further showed that both variants had significantly decreased nonspecific (undamaged) DNA binding. Molecular modeling suggested that R141Q substitution may have resulted in a direct loss of the salt bridge between ϵA-DNA and hMPG, whereas R120C substitution redistributed, at a distance, the interactions among residues in the catalytic pocket. Together our results suggest that individuals carrying R120C and R141Q MPG variants may be at risk for genomic instability and associated diseases as a consequence."
https://openalex.org/W2073678722,"Pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) is a highly conserved enzyme that evolved a second, unrelated function in mammals, as a transcriptional coactivator. As a coactivator, PCD is known as DCoH or dimerization cofactor of the transcription factor HNF-1. These two activities are associated with a change in oligomeric state: from two dimers interacting as an enzyme in the cytoplasm to a dimer interacting with a dimer of HNF-1 in the nucleus. The same interface of DCoH forms both complexes. To determine how DCoH partitions between its two functions, we studied the folding and stability of the DCoH homotetramer. We show that the DCoH1 homotetramer is kinetically trapped, meaning once it forms it will not dissociate to interact with HNF-1. In contrast, DCoH2, a paralog of DCoH1, unfolds within hours. A simple mutation in the interface of DCoH2 from Ser-51 to Thr, as found in DCoH1, increases the kinetic stability by 9 orders of magnitude, to τ(½) ∼ 2 million years. This suggests that the DCoH1·HNF-1 complex must co-fold to interact. We conclude that simple mutations can dramatically affect the dissociation kinetics of a complex. Residue 51 represents a ""kinetic hot spot"" instead of a ""thermodynamic hot spot."" Kinetic regulation allows PCD to adopt two distinct functions. Mutations in DCoH1 associated with diabetes affect both functions of DCoH1, perhaps by disrupting the balance between the two DCoH complexes."

Subsequently, the replication proteins, such as helicase, primase, and DNA polymerase, are loaded onto the unwound region.

The RepE initiator is a double-stranded and single-stranded DNA-binding protein that forms an atypical open complex at the onset of replication of plasmid pAMβ1 from Gram-positive bacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10234-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The replication initiator Rep of the E. coli plasmid ColE2-P9 (297 amino acids, 34 kDa) is another exception. This Rep specifically binds to the replication origin of the plasmid (Ori; 31 bp) (12Itoh T. Horii T.

The ColE2-P9 Ori is the smallest origin among those identified and analyzed to date (15Yagura M. Nishio S.Y. Kurozumi H. Wang C.F. Itoh T. Anatomy of the replication origin of plasmid ColE2-P9.J.

This Ori can be divided into three functional regions; subregions I and II are important for Rep binding, whereas subregions II and III are important for initiation of DNA replication, and subregion III contains the template sequence for primer RNA synthesis (15Yagura M. Nishio S.Y. Kurozumi H. Wang C.F. Itoh T. Anatomy of the replication origin of plasmid ColE2-P9.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Rep has been thought to consist of two functional domains: an N-terminal primase domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (E2Rep-DBD, residues 175–297) (Fig. 1B). The C-terminal region of E2Rep-DBD determines its binding specificity to Ori (17Han M. Yagura M. Itoh T. Specific interaction between the initiator protein (Rep) and origin of plasmid ColE2-P9.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1061-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 21Aoki K. Shinohara M. Itoh T.

Biol. 1996; 257: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of E2Rep-DBD contains a functionally unknown region called the PriCT (primase C-terminal) domain that is commonly found near the C termini of some primases belonging to the superfamily of archaeo-eukaryotic primases (23Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Leipe D.D. Aravind L. Origin and evolution of the archaeo-eukaryotic primase superfamily and related palm-domain proteins: structural insights and new members.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3875-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The PriCT domain of E2Rep-DBD has been shown to be involved in origin unwinding (17Han M. Yagura M. Itoh T. Specific interaction between the initiator protein (Rep) and origin of plasmid ColE2-P9.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1061-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 21Aoki K. Shinohara M. Itoh T. Distinct functions of the two specificity determinants in replication initiation of plasmids ColE2-P9 and ColE3-CA38.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2392-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rep binds to and unwinds Ori as a monomer (24Han M. Aoki K. Yagura M. Itoh T. The ColE2-P9 Rep protein binds to the origin DNA as a monomer.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). All of these data suggest a novel mechanism of origin unwinding by the E2Rep-DBD. For the past 20 years, however, a growing number of plasmids containing putative Rep proteins and origins closely related to those of plasmid ColE2-P9 have been described (15Yagura M. Nishio S.Y. Kurozumi H. Wang C.F. Itoh T. Anatomy of the replication origin of plasmid ColE2-P9.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These ColE2-related plasmids were found in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive host bacteria and now form a large plasmid family (NCBI nucleotide database). They probably share a common mechanism of plasmid DNA replication initiation that is mediated by initiator proteins closely related to ColE2 Rep (ColE2 Rep-related proteins). The unique initiation mechanism of the plasmid ColE2-P9 DNA replication has thus far been studied using biochemical and genetic approaches. The molecular mechanisms of the specific binding to and unwinding of Ori by Rep, however, have remained unknown due to the lack of structural information. In this paper, we present the crystal structure of the ColE2 Rep protein in complex with Ori DNA. This structure indicates that the conserved yet functionally unknown PriCT domain plays important roles in Ori unwinding. The results therefore provide the first structural evidence demonstrating the functional importance of the conserved PriCT domain and reveal how a single protein can mediate DNA unwinding. The E2Rep-DBD protein (Arg175–Lys297) was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) using the pET-28M vector, which is the modified version of the pET-28b(+) vector (Merck Millipore) to attach an octapeptide (MGHHHHHH) at the N terminus of the target protein. The cells were grown at 37 °C until reaching an A600 of 0.5, and overexpression of E2Rep-DBD was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for 10 h at 16 °C before harvesting. The cells were suspended in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and DNase I and disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged to clarify, and the supernatant was applied onto a His-trap crude FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol. The column was washed with 6 column volumes of the wash buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 2 column volumes of the elution buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 m NaCl, 0.5 m imidazole, and 10% glycerol. The eluted protein was purified using a Superdex75pg 16/60 size exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The purified protein was mixed with 23-bp Ori DNA at a molar ratio of protein/DNA = 1:1.1 for crystallization. The oligonucleotide DNA fragments were purchased from the manufacturer (Hokkaido System Science, Hokkaido, Japan). The protein/DNA mixture was dialyzed against the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Complex formation was confirmed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and the complex was concentrated for crystallization using a centrifugal ultrafiltration device (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). Initial crystallization screening of the E2Rep-DBD·Ori DNA complex was performed using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in a 96-well crystallization plate (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Kremsmünster, Austria) at 20 °C with the commercially available screening kits Crystal Screen, Crystal Screen II, and Natrix (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and Wizard I and Wizard II (Emerald BioStructures, Bedford, MA). The crystals used for structure determination were obtained in a solution consisting of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.4, 0.6 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.5 m LiSO4 in a 24-well VDX plate (Hampton Research) at 20 °C. The crystals took several weeks to grow. Native x-ray intensity data were collected from a cryocooled crystal at Beamline BL17A in Photon Factory (KEK, Tsukuba, Japan). The heavy atom derivative was obtained by the soaking method (5 mm K2Pt(CN)4 in the solution). Single wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected using the platinum-soaked crystal on Beamline AR-NE3A at the Photon Factory. The data were processed using HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). A substructure analysis was performed by the single wavelength anomalous diffraction method using SOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Automated MAD and MIR structure solution.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), and the initial phases were calculated using PHASER (27McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D.

The platinum atoms were found in the intermolecular spaces among the protein molecules in the crystal, and the partial atomic model corresponding to the N-terminal domain of the protein was obtained using RESOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of the complex of E2Rep-DBD (residues 175–294) and 23-bp DNA comprising subregions I and II of Ori (Fig. 1A) was determined to 2.7 Å resolution. The final atomic model includes E2Rep-DBD residues Arg175–Lys291, the non-template strand (5Thy–22Thy), and the template strand (13′Gua–32′Cyt) (Fig. 2). Helices H1–H3 form a helix bundle, which corresponds to the conserved PriCT domain (the PriCT module). Helix H4 (the H4 module) connects the PriCT module and the C-terminal module consisting of helices H5–H7 (the HTH module). Helices H6-H7 in this module form an HTH motif with H7 corresponding to the recognition helix (Fig. 2A). The three E2Rep-DBD modules are connected with loops and form an elongated fold, indicating that the protein conformation is likely to be flexible, or at least not fixed, without its binding partner, duplex Ori DNA. The surface of E2Rep-DBD is significantly positively charged (Fig. 2B), and nearly one-third of the surface area of the protein (2,606 Å2 of 9,583 Å2 calculated by using PISA (35Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar)) contributes to its interaction with DNA. Although E2Rep-DBD is small (15 kDa), this interaction surface area is comparable with that observed in larger protein·DNA complexes, such as the archaeal DNA replication initiator Cdc6·Orc1 complex (Protein Data Bank entry 2QBY) (36Dueber E.L. Corn J.E. Bell S.D. Berger J.M. Replication origin recognition and deformation by a heterodimeric archaeal Orc1 complex.Science. 2007; 317: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which has a molecular mass of 85 kDa and a protein-DNA interaction surface area with its 33-bp duplex DNA of 2,699 Å2. The HTH module binds to the major groove near the upstream end of Ori DNA (Figs. 2A and 3). The H4 module binds to the minor groove of the duplex DNA, and the double-helical structure of the DNA is broken near the N terminus of this module. The PriCT module binds to the single-stranded template strand of Ori DNA, just upstream of the template sequence for the primer RNA, whereas the non-template strand extends toward the solvent without any interaction with the protein. The unwinding of a limited region of Ori DNA in the crystal is consistent with previous biochemical data (17Han M. Yagura M. Itoh T. Specific interaction between the initiator protein (Rep) and origin of plasmid ColE2-P9.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1061-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains two complex molecules (complex I: Protein Data Bank chains A, C, and D; complex II: Protein Data Bank chains B, E, and F). Comparison of their tertiary structures showed that they are in slightly different conformations. The structures of the N-terminal segments (amino acid residues 175–239, which correspond to the PriCT module) of the two complex molecules were identical, and so were those of the C-terminal segments (amino acid residues 249–291, which correspond to the H4 and HTH modules). The root mean square deviations for comparisons are 0.27 and 0.54 Å for the main chain atoms of the N- and C-terminal segments of the protein, respectively (the values were calculated using PROLSQ in the CCP4 suite (34Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar)). Obvious differences, however, existed in the relative positions of the two segments in the complexes (Fig. 2C). The overall structure and the protein-DNA interactions, especially in the C-terminal segment, were very similar between these complexes (see below for further discussion). Thus, in this paper, only the structure of complex I has been shown in the figures, except for Figs. 2 (C and D) and 4C. E2Rep-DBD has an elongated fold, and thus the HTH and H4 modules can interact with sites of duplex Ori DNA that are considerably distant from each other. The HTH module of E2Rep-DBD exclusively binds to subregion I of Ori, which is important for stably anchoring Rep onto the DNA (15Yagura M. Nishio S.Y. Kurozumi H. Wang C.F. Itoh T. Anatomy of the replication origin of plasmid ColE2-P9.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Five interactions with the bases (Arg282-28′Gua, Tyr286-28′Gua and 29′Thy, Ala283-7Ade, and Arg287-6Gua) and three interactions with the phosphate backbone (Ser281, Thr284, and Lys290) from helix H7, the DNA-binding helix, were observed (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4A). Helix H6, the first helix of the HTH motif, is shorter than those found in canonical HTHs, probably due to the presence of Pro274, which is located immediately N-terminal to the helix. As a result, the E2Rep-DBD HTH is more compact than the typical HTH motif. Arg270 and Ser271 in helix H5, adjacent to the HTH motif, also contribute to base recognition and DNA binding stabilization, respectively (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4A). The C-terminal region of Rep containing this HTH module is necessary and sufficient for specific binding to Ori (17Han M. Yagura M. Itoh T. Specific interaction between the initiator protein (Rep) and origin of plasmid ColE2-P9.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1061-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, the crystal structure clearly shows that the Rep HTH module is the primary region that mediates binding specificity and affinity with its Ori site. It is noted that the tight binding of the HTH module to Ori DNA through these extensive contacts using the amino acids from helices H7 and H5 results in widening of the DNA major groove (17 Å compared with 11 Å in B-DNA). The H4 module and the loop connecting this module to the C-terminal HTH module (H4-H5 loop) bind along the minor groove of duplex DNA to the upstream and central parts of subregion II (Fig. 3), which is important for binding with Rep and replication (15Yagura M.

https://openalex.org/W2091293019,"Objective and Methods This paper proposes an inegrative two-stage genome-wide search for pairwise epistasis on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). The traits are clustered into multi-trait complexes that account for correlations between them that may result from common epistasis effects. The search is done by first screening for epistatic regions and then using dense markers within the identified regions, resulting in substantial reduction in the number of tests for epistasis. The FDR is controlled using a hierarchical procedure that accounts for the search structure. Each combination of trait and marker-pair is tested using a model that accounts for both statistical and functional interpretations of epistasis and considers orthogonal effects, such that their contributions to heritability can be estimated individually. We examine the impact of using multi-trait complexes rather than single traits, and of using a hierarchical search for epistasis rather than skipping the initial screen for epistatic regions. We apply the proposed algorithm on Arabidopsis transcription data. Principal Findings Both epistasis detection power and heritability contributed by epistasis increased when using multi-trait complexes rather than single traits. Epistatic effects common to the eQTLs included in the complexes have higher chance of being identified by analysis of multi-trait complexes, particularly when epistatic effects on individual traits are small. Compared to direct testing for all potential epistatic effects, the hierarchical search was substantially more powerful in detecting epistasis, while controlling the FDR at the desired level. Association in functional roles within genomic regions was observed, supporting an initial screen for epistatic QTLs."
