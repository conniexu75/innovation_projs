https://openalex.org/W2083430062,"The efficient introduction of genetic material into quiescent nerve cells is important in the study of brain function and for gene therapy of neurological disorders. A replication-deficient adenoviral vector that contained a reporter gene encoding beta-galactosidase infected rat nerve cells in vitro and in vivo. beta-Galactosidase was expressed in almost all sympathetic neurons and astrocytes in culture. After stereotactic inoculations into the rat hippocampus and the substantia nigra, beta-galactosidase activity was detected for 2 months. Infected cells were identified as microglial cells, astrocytes, or neurons with anatomical, morphological, and immunohistochemical criteria. No obvious cytopathic effect was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2051541258,"The experiments reported here document that the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (pRB) plays an important role in the production and maintenance of the terminally differentiated phenotype of muscle cells. We show that pRB inactivation, through either phosphorylation, binding to T antigen, or genetic alteration, inhibits myogenesis. Moreover, inactivation of pRB in terminally differentiated cells allows them to reenter the cell cycle. In addition to its involvement in the myogenic activities of MyoD, pRB is also required for the cell growth-inhibitory activity of this myogenic factor. We also show that pRB and MyoD directly bind to each other, both in vivo and in vitro, through a region that involves the pocket and the basic-helix-loop-helix domains, respectively. All the results obtained are consistent with the proposal that the effects of MyoD on the cell cycle and of pRB on the myogenic pathway result from the direct binding of the two molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2126043518,"T cells bearing T cell receptor (TCR) gamma and delta chain heterodimers are first generated early in ontogeny. They form distinct subsets that differ in their TCR repertoires and tissue distribution. Disruption of the mouse TCR C delta gene segment by a gene targeting method caused the complete loss of T cells bearing TCR gamma delta chains, but had little or no effect on the development of T cells bearing TCR alpha beta chains. The analyses of TCR gamma and delta genes in the mutant mice suggest that intracellular mechanisms acting at the level of DNA rearrangement play key roles in the differential gamma and delta gene rearrangements and in the generation of the highly restricted junctional sequences during fetal thymic development."
https://openalex.org/W1505149221,"Myeloperoxidase, secreted by activated phagocytes, produces the powerful cytotoxin hypochlorous acid from H2O2 and Cl-. We show that the enzyme can also employ H2O2 to oxidize L-tyrosine to tyrosyl radical, yielding the stable cross-linked product dityrosine. Dityrosine synthesis by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2 system did not require halide and was partially inhibited by Cl-. At physiological concentrations of Cl-, L-tyrosine, and other plasma amino acids, purified myeloperoxidase utilized 26% of the H2O2 in the reaction mixture to form dityrosine. Aminotriazole, cyanide, and azide inhibited the reaction. Phorbol ester-stimulated human neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages similarly generated dityrosine from L-tyrosine by a pathway inhibited by catalase, aminotriazole, and azide. The requirement for H2O2 and the inhibition by heme poisons suggest that activated phagocytes synthesize dityrosine by a peroxidative mechanism. These results indicate that L-tyrosine can compete effectively with Cl- as a substrate for myeloperoxidase and raise the possibility that formation of tyrosyl radical may play a role in the phagocyte inflammatory response. Because dityrosine is protease-resistant, stable to acid hydrolysis, and intensely fluorescent, its identification in tissues may pinpoint targets where phagocytes inflict oxidative damage in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2082181748,"Mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid hormones elicit distinct physiologic responses, yet the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) bind to and activate transcription similarly from a consensus simple hormone response element (HRE). The activities of GR and MR at plfG, a 25-base pair composite response element to which both the steroid receptors and transcription factor AP1 can bind, are analyzed here. Under conditions in which GR represses AP1-stimulated transcription from plfG, MR was inactive. With the use of MR-GR chimeras, a segment of the NH2-terminal region of GR (amino acids 105 to 440) was shown to be required for this repression. Thus, the distinct physiologic effects mediated by MR and GR may be determined by differential interactions of nonreceptor factors with specific receptor domains at composite response elements."
https://openalex.org/W2037184237,"The gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABAA) receptor is a ligand-gated ionophore involved in synaptic inhibition. Biochemical and molecular biological studies indicate that considerable receptor heterogeneity exists, but physiological differences between inhibitory GABAA synaptic responses have not been identified in the brain. The present report describes two anatomically segregated GABAA-mediated synaptic currents in the hippocampal CA1 region that have distinct physiological, pharmacological, and functional properties. GABAA,fast enters at or near the cell body, decays rapidly (3-8 ms), is blocked by furosemide, and rapidly curtails the excitatory response. GABAA,slow enters far from the cell body, decays slowly (30-70 ms), is not blocked by furosemide, and underlies the conventionally recognized early inhibitory postsynaptic potential. The receptors producing these responses may represent subtypes of the GABAA receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2066612759,"Invasion of host cells is essential for the pathogenicity of Salmonella. We have recently shown that invasion of cultured epithelial cells by S. typhimurium is accompanied by activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. In this report we show that S. typhimurium invasion stimulated a rapid increase in the levels of free intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in cultured epithelial cells. Mutants defective in invasion were unable to induce these calcium fluxes, and addition of calcium antagonists blocked wild-type S. typhimurium entry. These results indicate that [Ca2+]i increase is required for bacterial entry. Further analysis demonstrated that phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase activities resulting in production of leukotrienes are required for bacterial entry. Addition of the leukotriene D4 to Henle-407 cells caused both an increase in [Ca2+]i and the internalization of an invasion-defective mutant of S. typhimurium. Furthermore, S. typhimurium caused the activation of mitogen-activated protein (also known as extracellular signal-regulated protein) kinase in infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2003861265,"Ligand-gated ion channels gated by glutamate constitute the major excitatory neurotransmitter system in the mammalian brain. The functional modulation of GluR6, a kainate-activated glutamate receptor, by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) was examined with receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. Kainate-evoked currents underwent a rapid desensitization that was blocked by lectins. Kainate currents were potentiated by intracellular perfusion of PKA, and this potentiation was blocked by co-application of an inhibitory peptide. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the site or sites of phosphorylation on GluR6. Although mutagenesis of two serine residues, Ser684 and Ser666, was required for complete abolition of the PKA-induced potentiation, Ser684 may be the preferred site of phosphorylation in native GluR6 receptor complexes. These results indicate that glutamate receptor function can be directly modulated by protein phosphorylation and suggest that a dynamic regulation of excitatory receptors could be associated with some forms of learning and memory in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W1566912406,"The chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily about which little is known of its functional role in the cell. However, it is able to repress hormonal induction of target genes by vitamin D3 receptor (VDR), thyroid hormone receptor (TR), and retinoic acid receptor (RAR). We have shown previously that COUP-TF can bind a wide variety of A/GGGTCA repeats. This promiscuous recognition of response elements correlates with the ability of COUP-TF I to repress other receptors that bind to A/GGGTCA repeats with different spacings between the half-sites. Here we show that repression of transactivation by these receptors is a general phenomenon for the COUP-TF subfamily, as inhibition is also observed with COUP-TF II. This repression is also dose-dependent on COUP-TF. Inhibition of VDR, TR, and RAR activities also occurs through natural physiological response elements found in the osteocalcin, myosin heavy chain, and beta RAR promoters, respectively. In search of the mechanisms of repression by COUP-TF we show that it does not involve the formation of detectable functionally inactive heterodimers between COUP-TF and VDR, TR, and RAR. Instead, we show that the mechanism of repression could occur at three different levels: (a) active silencing of transcription and dual competition for; (b) occupancy of DNA binding sites; and (c), heterodimer formation with retinoid X receptor, the coregulator of VDR, TR, and RAR. The silencing activity was localized to the putative ligand binding domain of COUP-TF. We postulate that COUP-TF may play a master role in regulating transactivation by VDR, TR, and RAR."
https://openalex.org/W1596456096,"Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases are critically involved in controlling cell cycle progression in virtually all cells. The recent identification of candidate G1 cyclins in mammalian cells has been a major advance in this field, but the exact functions of these cyclins are unknown. The expression of three D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) was investigated in primary human T lymphocytes as these cells were induced to leave G0, traverse G1, and enter S phase by T cell-specific mitogens. G0 phase T cells expressed low levels of cyclin D2, but not cyclin D3. Treatment of these cells with phytohemagglutinin and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in the presence of fetal calf serum resulted in rapid induction of cyclin D2 RNA in early G1 and slower induction of cyclin D3 in late G1. Cyclin D1 was not detected in T cells under any condition tested. Treatment of T cells with hydroxyurea to arrest cells at G1/S did not block induction of either D2 or D3. However, arrest of cells in mid G1 with deferoxamine blocked D3 expression without affecting D2. Cyclosporin A blocked the induction of both cyclin D2 and D3. Polyclonal antisera were prepared in rabbits against both cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and used to examine cyclin D2 and D3 proteins in [35S]methionine-labeled T cells. Protein levels were found to correlate closely with RNA levels for both cyclins. No detectable histone H1 kinase activity could be precipitated with either cyclin. However, several cellular proteins were observed to coprecipitate with the cyclins, including several proteins that were observed to associate only with D3. These results indicate that striking differences exist in the induction and regulation of two candidate G1 cyclins in human T cells and suggest that these cyclins could participate in multiple cell cycle checkpoints during G0, G1, or S phase."
https://openalex.org/W1987026484,"Two mutations in the sodium channel alpha subunit that have been implicated as the cause of periodic paralysis were studied by functional expression in a mammalian cell line. Both mutations disrupted inactivation without affecting the time course of the onset of the sodium current or the single-channel conductance. This is the same functional defect that was observed in myotubes cultured from affected patients and proves that these mutations are not benign polymorphisms. Unlike the currents in the myotubes, however, there was no consistent potassium dependence for the noninactivating component. These mutations also define new regions of the sodium channel alpha subunit that are involved in the process of inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2042917581,"D-raf, a Drosophila homolog of Raf-1, plays key roles in multiple signal transduction pathways. Dsor1, a putative factor downstream of D-raf, was genetically identified by screening of dominant suppressors of D-raf. Dsor1Su1 mapped on X chromosome significantly suppressed the D-raf mutant phenotypes, and the loss-of-function mutations of Dsor1 showed phenotypes similar to those of the D-raf null mutations. Dsor1Su1 also significantly suppressed the mutations of other terminal class genes acting further upstream of D-raf. Molecular cloning of Dsor1 revealed its product with striking similarity to the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinase activator and yeast PBS2, STE7, and byr1. Our genetic results demonstrate the connection between raf and the highly conserved protein kinase cascade involving MAP kinase in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1570629413,"Insulin stimulates the appearance of anti-tyrosine(P)-immunoprecipitable phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity in adipocytes, predominantly in an intracellular membrane fraction (Kelly, K. L., Ruderman, N. B., and Chen, K. S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3423-3428). Neither the mechanism underlying this activation nor the precise subcellular compartment in which it occurs is known. To address these questions, studies were performed using isolated rat adipocytes and subcellular fractions of these cells. In intact cells, insulin stimulated the rapid appearance of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in 32P-labeled adipocytes without changing the labeling of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. This effect was accompanied by the tyrosyl phosphorylation of a 185-kDa protein, tentatively identified as IRS-1, with which PI 3-kinase became associated. The majority of the p85, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, in untreated adipocytes was present in the cytosol; however, neither the activity of PI 3-kinase nor the total amount of p85 in this fraction was modified in response to insulin. In contrast, insulin increased the association of p85 with IRS-1, the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the IRS-1 associated with p85, and the total activity of PI 3-kinase in the plasma membranes and low density membranes. After insulin treatment, similar amounts of p85 were bound to IRS-1 in the low density and plasma membrane fractions; however, tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase activity were an order of magnitude greater in the low density membranes. The complex of tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS-1.p85 that formed in response to insulin was localized to a very low density vesicle subpopulation that could be distinguished from vesicles containing the GLUT-4 glucose transporter and the insulin receptor. These data suggest that the activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin in the adipocyte involves the formation of a complex between IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase in a very low density membrane fraction that is not enriched in GLUT-4 or insulin receptors. They also suggest that PI 3-kinase activation correlates more closely with the extent of tyrosyl phosphorylation of the IRS-1 complexed to PI 3-kinase than it does to the amount of p85 bound to IRS-1."
https://openalex.org/W1991864133,"Adenosine is released in the brain in significant quantities in response to increased cellular activity. Adenosine has been shown either to decrease synaptic transmission or to produce an excitatory response in hippocampal synapses, resulting in increased glutamate release. Previous reports have shown that adenosine or its analogs reduced Ca2+ current in dorsal root ganglion and hippocampal neurons. Here we show that the selective activation of adenosine receptor subtypes has different effects on Ca2+ channels from acutely isolated pyramidal neurons from the CA3 region of guinea pig hippocampus. Activation of A1 receptors inhibited primarily N-type Ca2+ current. In contrast, activation of A2b receptors resulted in significant potentiation of P-type but not N-type Ca2+ current. This potentiation could be inhibited by blocking the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Because of the ubiquity of adenosine, the differential effects on Ca2+ channels of adenosine receptor subtype activation may have significant implications for neuronal excitability."
https://openalex.org/W1495033801,"The peroxidative activity of Cu,Zn-containing superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD) was studied by using a chromogen, 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) which reacts with .OH radicals to form ABTS+, and the spin traps, N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). The formation of ABTS+. in this study required both active Cu,Zn-SOD and H2O2 and followed first order kinetics with respect to SOD and H2O2. However, it showed a binding isotherm with ABTS that yielded a dissociation constant of ABTS-enzyme as Kd = 7.1 +/- 0.5 microM. The Kd values for DMPO and PBN were obtained as 0.63 and 11 mM, respectively, by competition reactions. A radical scavenger, formate anion, inhibits the formation of ABTS+., whereas ethanol does not. The results together indicate that DMPO and anionic scavengers have easy access inside the positively charged active channel of Cu,Zn-SOD and are thus in a position to intercept the newly formed .OH radicals. PBN and ethanol, however, stay outside of the channel and are not able to compete with ABTS for .OH radicals. We trapped free radicals, which were produced in the presence of free radical scavengers, with PBN. The formation curve of PBN-hydroxyethyl radical adduct observed in the presence of ethanol indicated that the enzyme became inactivated in a relatively short period. In contrast, in the presence of anionic scavenger formate, formyl radicals were produced catalytically, and the enzyme activity was protected by the formate against H2O2 inactivation. Thus Cu,Zn-SOD behaves as an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of free radicals using anionic scavengers and H2O2 as substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1485488844,"There is little information concerning the intracellular function of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakis- and hexakisphosphate, despite their being the most abundant inositol polyphosphates. Current opinions that they play passive roles as antioxidants (Graf, E., Mahoney, J. R., Bryant, R. G., and Eaton, J. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3620-3624) or housekeeping molecules (Berridge, M. J., and Irvine, R. F. (1989) Nature 341, 197-205) arises from belief in their metabolic lethargy. However, we have discovered that cell homogenates, incubated with 5 mM fluoride and 5 mM ATP, converted both inositol hexakisphosphate (Km = 2 +/- 0.5 microM, Vmax = 9 +/- 2 pmol/mg of protein/min) and inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (Km = 13 +/- 4 microM, Vmax = 11 +/- 5 pmol/mg of protein/min) to more polar products. These reactions were also observed in intact cells treated with 0.5-20 mM fluoride, and the precursor/product relationships were confirmed by comparing the effects of fluoride on cells differentially labeled with [3H]inositol in either short-term or pulse-chase protocols. The novel products were determined to be inositol pyrophosphates because of their relatively specific hydrolysis by tobacco pyrophosphatase and alkaline phosphatase. The pyrophosphates were metabolized rapidly by cell homogenates back to their pentakisphosphate and hexakisphosphate precursors. This endogenous pyrophosphatase activity was inhibited by up to 99% by 5 mM fluoride in vitro. In intact cells incubated with 10 mM fluoride, about 20% of the inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate pool, and 50% of the inositol hexakisphosphate pool were each converted to pyrophosphate derivatives within 1 h."
https://openalex.org/W2027197361,"Opioids are regarded to act via receptors interacting with heterotrimeric pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins. In membranes of SH-SY5Y cells, the mu-selective agonist [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAGO) and the delta-selective agonist [D-Pen2,Pen5]-enkephalin (DPDPE) stimulated incorporation of the photoreactive GTP analog [alpha-32P]GTP azidoanilide into proteins comigrating with the alpha subunits of G(i1), G(i2), G(i3), G(o1), and another form of G(o), presumably G(o2). In membranes of PTX-treated cells, both agonists were ineffective. Subtype-specific immunoprecipitation of G protein alpha subunits photolabeled in the absence or presence of agonists revealed profound differences between mu and delta opioid receptors in coupling to PTX-sensitive G proteins. Whereas activated delta opioid receptors preferentially coupled to G(i1), activated mu opioid receptors more effectively coupled to G(i3). Additionally, we provide evidence that G(o) subtypes are also differentially activated by the two receptors. Thus, mu and delta opioid receptors appear to discriminate between PTX-sensitive G proteins and lead to activation of distinct G protein subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2020251125,"The effect of protein kinase C (PKC) stimulation on Ca2+ channels was studied in frog sympathetic neurons. 12,13-Phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) consistently augmented Ca2+ channel currents in whole-cell recordings. This enhancement was blocked by staurosporine and PKC(19–31), but not produced by 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, indicating that PDBu acts via PKC. Both N- and L-type currents, as isolated pharmacologically, were increased. PKC enhancement was independent of the extent of G protein activation, indicating that it was not caused by removal of tonic G protein inhibition. In unitary recordings PDBu produced dramatic increases in single N- and L-type channel activity by sharply decreasing closed time intervals between adjacent openings, but did not alter the unitary current size or mean open time. This up-modulation by PKC may constitute a positive feedback mechanism in the regulation of neuronal Ca2+ channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2058269689,"To investigate the mechanism of interaction of the toxin colicin E1 with membranes, three cysteine substitution mutants and the wild type of the channel-forming fragment were spin labeled at the unique thiol. Time-resolved interaction of these labeled proteins with phospholipid vesicles was investigated with stopped-flow electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The fragment interacts with neutral bilayers at low pH, indicating that the interaction is hydrophobic rather than electrostatic. The interaction occurs in at least two distinct steps: (i) rapid adsorption to the surface; and (ii) slow, rate-limiting insertion of the hydrophobic central helices into the membrane interior."
https://openalex.org/W1491410831,"Using the glycoprotein of the tsO45 mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) as a marker, we have developed a system capable of measuring vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the trans Golgi network (TGN) in vitro. Movement from the ER to the cis Golgi compartment was assessed by the conversion of VSV-G from a totally endoglycosidase D (endo D)-resistant form to a species containing one endo D-resistant and one endo D-sensitive oligosaccharide (GD1). Similarly, delivery to the medial cisternae was measured by the appearance of the completely endo D-sensitive form of VSV-G (GD2) or by the acquisition of complete resistance to endoglycosidase H (endo H) (GHr) and delivery to the TGN by the appearance of an endo H-resistant form of VSV-G which was sensitive to digestion with neuraminidase and subsequently beta-galactosidase (GHt). Movement between each sequential compartment required ATP and soluble proteins (cytosol) and was inhibited by nonhydrolyzable analogues of GTP and by an antibody toward the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor NSF. In contrast, fractionation of the cytosol by ammonium sulfate precipitation indicated that distinct proteins were required for movement between successive compartments. Similarly, inclusion of a mutant form of the small molecular weight GTP-binding protein rab1A inhibited movement between the ER and cis Golgi, and between the cis and medial cisternae, but did not affect transport from the medial Golgi to the TGN. Conversely, the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine prevented movement between the medial Golgi and the TGN but did not influence transport between the ER and early Golgi compartments. This study provides the first demonstration that vesicular transport between the ER and TGN can be reconstituted in a cytosol-dependent fashion in vitro, allowing a direct analysis of the roles of individual components in multiple transport events."
https://openalex.org/W2160765485,"Sustained elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by cell surface receptors is often dependent on influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane through routes not involving voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. We demonstrate that intracellular release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), either from stimulation of transfected human muscarinic receptors or from photolytic release of caged InsP3, activates whole cell Ca2+ current in the Jurkat T cell line. Whole cell voltage clamp recordings indicate that the current is carried by a Ca(2+)-selective channel that resembles T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in relative conductance of different cation species. Elevation of internal Ca2+ inactivates the channel, whereas internal perfusion with inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) does not affect it. Photolytic release of caged 1-(alpha-glycerophosphoryl)-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate, an analog of InsP3 which activates InsP3 receptors but is not readily metabolized to InsP4, also activates the current. We conclude that generation of InsP3 is sufficient to activate Ca(2+)-selective channels in the plasma membrane of T cells. InsP3 may have its effect indirectly through depletion of Ca2+ stores, or directly with a plasma membrane-associated InsP3 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1519638961,"The FixL and FixJ proteins of Rhizobium meliloti control the expression of other nif and fix genes in response to oxygen levels. FixL is a hemoprotein kinase that senses oxygen availability and responds to the absence of oxygen by activation of its autophosphorylating activity followed by transfer of the phosphate to FixJ. FixJ in turn activates the nifA and fixK promoters. In vitro studies reported here with a soluble truncated version of FixL (FixL*) indicate that, while low oxygen tension specifically increases the autophosphorylating activity of FixL*, the ability of phospho-FixL* to act as a phosphate donor to FixJ is not affected by the presence or absence of oxygen. FixL* is also shown to possess a phosphatase activity that is repressed under anaerobic conditions only when the protein is in the phosphorylated form. A fixL mutant that induces a higher level of nifA promoter activity in the presence of fixJ in vivo displayed both an increased autophosphorylating activity and a decreased phosphatase activity in vitro. These data provide evidence for a role for both autophosphorylation and phosphatase activities of FixL in the mechanism by which oxygen tension within the alfalfa nodule induces expression of bacterial nitrogen fixation genes during symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W1528717760,"The gene that encodes the beta 3 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyrate-Type A (GABAA) receptor is widely expressed in brain tissue and has been associated with imprinted genetic disorders. Here, the 5' regions of the human and rat genes were characterized and found to be highly conserved in both coding and non-coding sequences. A novel transcript of the human gene revealed the existence of an alternative exon 1 (exon 1a) that encodes a variant signal sequence. Relative levels of the alternative transcripts were found to vary between fetal and adult brain, and between different brain regions. Endogenous beta 3 subunit transcripts were also detected in several immortalized cell lines, including human kidney 293 cells. Transcription of exon 1 is initiated from multiple sites within a pyrimidine-rich region of the gene. This region of the human gene also exhibits strong promoter activity and binds nuclear factors at a site which overlaps the transcriptional start sites. The promoter element was shown to bind Sp1 and at least one other unidentified nuclear factor."
https://openalex.org/W1532696415,"We have mapped the basal promoter activity of the mouse cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit Vb gene to the -17 to +20 region which contains two putative ets binding sites flanking an NF-E1 site fused to an Sp1 site. A 17-nucleotide sequence flanking the major transcription start site (-8 to +9), referred to as 17Inr (initiator sequence) was able to drive CAT activity in 3T3 cells to a level comparable to the construct containing sequences -17 to +20. This suggests that the 17Inr sequence contains the initiator activity. The 17Inr contains a pyrimidine-rich sequence, commencing with a CA that corresponds to the major transcription start site. Primer extension of RNA from transfected cells demonstrated that transcription initiation with the 17Inr template occurs at a site identical to the endogenous gene. DNA-protein binding by gel mobility shift and methylation interference analyses indicated that the pyrimidine-rich sequence immediately flanking the transcription start site consists of an NF-E1 factor binding motif with an overlapping upstream Sp1 binding site. A 13-nucleotide sequence, 13Inr (-4 to +9), which retains the NF-E1 binding activity but does not bind Sp1, was able to promote chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression at levels similar to the 17Inr sequence, suggesting that NF-E1 factor binding is critical for initiator function. Finally, using an in vitro transcription system from Drosophila embryos we demonstrate that NF-E1 is necessary for transcription activation of both the 17Inr and the 13Inr initiator templates. Thus NF-E1 binding appears to be important for basal promoter function of the mouse COXVb gene."

https://openalex.org/W1490181254,"Polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) have been shown to induce transcription of the cytochrome P-450IA1 gene by activating an intracellular receptor protein (the Ah- or dioxin receptor) to bind to specific DNA sequences, termed xenobiotic response elements (XREs). However, the expression and inducibility of the cytochrome P-450IA1 activity exhibit tissue-specific differences. With regard to the TCDF induction response, we have examined three human cell types of endodermal (the hepatoma cell line HepG2), ectodermal (normal keratinocytes), and mesodermal origin (normal fibroblasts). DNase I hypersensitivity analysis of the 5' flank and first intron of the P-450IA1 gene showed that in the nonresponsive fibroblasts the chromatin structure lacked open regions while in the two responsive cell types (keratinocytes and HepG2) several constitutive hypersensitive sites as well as TCDF-induced alterations in the chromatin structure could be detected. This observation might correlate with the fact that the XRE, in either the context of the P-450IA1 gene sequences or in front of a heterologous promoter, was inefficient in directing a TCDF induction response in fibroblasts. In in vitro DNA binding studies, the dioxin receptor was activated to a DNA-binding nuclear form in all three cell types. However, in fibroblast nuclear extracts two novel constitutive protein-XRE complexes were detected. The fibroblast factor(s) were immunochemically distinct from the receptor but exhibited indistinguishable DNA binding specificity. These data are compatible with a model where the P-450IA1 is noninducible in fibroblasts due to the presence of a putative repressor(s) which may compete effectively with the receptor for binding to the response element as indicated by in vitro DNA-binding off-rate experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1546706272,"Single portal vein smooth muscle cells were voltage-clamped using the whole cell patch-clamp technique. Intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was simultaneously monitored using the fluorescence from the dye indo-1. Noradrenaline (NA, 10 microM) evoked a transient increase in [Ca2+]i, due to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InP3)-induced Ca2+ release, followed by a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, caused by extracellular Ca2+ entry. This phase was maintained as long as NA was present and was never observed when the agonist was only briefly applied (3 s). Neither ryanodine, nor caffeine produced the Ca2+ influx whereas the complete depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pool in the absence of external Ca2+ allowed, when Ca2+ was readmitted, the activation of the Ca2+ entry which was used to replenish Ca2+ store. During NA stimulation, the Ca2+ entry was activated even if the Ca2+ pool had not been totally emptied. The Ca2+ entry pathway involved was blocked by Ni2+ and Mn2+, was not permeable to these ions, and was more sensitive to heparin than the InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. Thus, the complete depletion of Ca2+ store activates a Ca2+ influx which is modulated by NA such as in its presence, a partial depletion is enough to induce Ca2+ entry."

Addition of biotin or epsilon-amino-hexanoic acid-iminobiotin at the epsilon-LysB29 position to form BpaB25,B29 epsilon-biotinyl (BBpa) or BpaB25,B29 epsilon-(Aha-iminobiotin) analogues had little adverse effect on receptor binding affinity and provided a convenient handle for affinity purification, gel shift assays, and blotting of cross-linked complexes with avidin. The analogues were readily 125I-iodinated with the majority of 125I being incorporated at the TyrA14 position; the monoiodo-A14 derivative was easily separated from other forms by high performance liquid chromatography. Photolysis of a complex of the insulin receptor and either BpaB25 insulin or [125I]iodo-TyrA14,BpaB25 insulin yields a covalent insulin-receptor complex. The efficiency of cross-linking with these reagents was unusually high, ranging from 60 to 100%. Furthermore, cross-linking to the insulin receptor results in kinase activation in vitro, and in intact cells insulin receptor phosphorylation and internalization were both activated. Notably, even at saturating concentrations one molecule of BpaB25 insulin covalently cross-linked each alpha 2 beta 2 receptor, demonstrating that holoreceptor activation occurs with one high affinity insulin binding site occupied and, if a second insulin binds with lower affinity it must be in a different orientation. Bpa insulin analogues form a new class of photoaffinity reagents which facilitate studies relating insulin-insulin receptor structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1583530717,"Insulin has been shown to be important for normal liver regeneration to occur. The mechanisms whereby insulin may exert its effects on hepatocyte growth, however, are still unknown. The rat and human insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a specific target molecule for the insulin receptor beta subunit kinase and will bind to signal transducing molecules containing Src homology 2 domains through its multiple tyrosyl phosphorylation (TP) sites. This investigation examined how IRS-1 may be involved in insulin action during hepatocyte growth induced by two-thirds partial hepatectomy. The TP of IRS-1 was strikingly enhanced prior to the major wave of hepatocyte DNA synthesis at 24 h; IRS-1 protein and mRNA expression increased in parallel to a lesser extent after partial hepatectomy. TP of insulin receptor beta subunit, which enhances its kinase activity toward IRS-1, was increased in association with TP of IRS-1. Finally, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, one of signal transducing molecules containing Src homology 2 domains, was associated with IRS-1 following TP in vivo. These observations suggest that IRS-1 protein may play an important role in transmitting the insulin signal to intracellular regulators involved in hepatocyte growth."
https://openalex.org/W2077566099,"African trypanosomes evade the immune response of their hosts by sequentially expressing different variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs). We isolated a bloodstream trypanosome clone of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense that expresses a VSG normally present during the metacyclic stage of the parasite in the insect vector. Associated with the bloodstream reexpression of this metacyclic VSG is a gene conversion in which the duplicated, expressed gene of 1650 nt contains 11 scattered point mutations when compared with its donor gene. Analysis of an uncloned population of bloodstream trypanosomes revealed another VSG reexpressor of the same donor gene in which the coding region had undergone 24 point mutations. The mutations are unique to the duplicated gene and appear to be nontemplated. The generation of these mutations provides a way for the trypanosome to increase further its antigenic diversity."

https://openalex.org/W1565222183,"It has previously been shown that exocytic and endocytic membrane traffic are inhibited in mitotic mammalian cells. Here we have used a cell-free intra-Golgi transport assay supplemented with heterologous cytosols to mimic this effect in vitro. Cytosols with high histone kinase activity, made either from mitotic cells or by cyclin A treatment of interphase cells, inhibited intra-Golgi transport by up to 75%. Inhibition of transport was reversed by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine or by reduction in ATP levels leading to inactivation of histone kinase. The data indicate that cell cycle control of intra-Golgi transport is due to a reversible modification of cytosol, and this assay system may be used to study the molecular mechanism of mitotic transport inhibition in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2135088141,"Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy has been applied to study the solution binding of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to synthetic DNA duplex [d(GCGATCGC)]2. The structure of the complex at a molar ratio of 1:1 drug:duplex has been investigated. NMR results indicate that DAPI binds selectively in the minor groove of the DNA region containing only two A:T base pairs. The results disagree with conclusions drawn from footprinting experiments and show that the presence of the G3NH2 group in the minor groove does not prevent the binding. A molecular model is proposed that closely resembles the crystal structure previously published for the interaction of DAPI with the dodecamer [d(CGCGAATTCGCG)]2, containing four A:T base pairs in the binding site. In this model, DAPI lies in the minor groove, nearly isohelical, with its aromatic rings adjacent to H4' protons of T5 and C6 deoxyribose and the NH indole group oriented toward the DNA axis. The binding does not perturb the B-type conformation of the duplex, and the DNA oligomer conserves its 2-fold symmetry, indicating that fast exchange dynamics exist between the two stereochemically equivalent binding sites of the palindromic sequence. The binding constant and the exchange rate between free and bound species were also measured by NMR spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1600808722,"gCap39 is an actin filament end-capping protein which is a member of the gelsolin family. Unlike gelsolin, gCap39 does not sever actin filaments and is a cytoplasmic as well as nuclear protein. We report here that gCap39 is phosphorylated, while gelsolin is not. gCap39 is phosphorylated on serines and threonines at multiple sites, and phospho-gCap39 is resolved by isofocusing into multiple isoforms which are more acidic than unphosphorylated gCap39. In vitro dephosphorylation eliminates the acidic isoforms. Okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, stimulates gCap39 phosphorylation in vivo. It preferentially increases labeling of several peptides and enhances labeling of phosphothreonines relative to phosphoserines. The phosphorylation state of gCap39 in cells is therefore regulated by a balance between kinases and okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases, and phosphorylation sites containing threonines appear to be particularly sensitive to the phosphatases. Subcellular fractionation shows that the nuclear fraction contains 17 +/- 5% (n = 3) of total gCap39. Compared with the soluble cytoplasm, nuclear gCap39 has a 1.7 +/- 0.2 (n = 3) fold increase in the amount of 32P label incorporation and a higher ratio of acidic/basic gCap39. We conclude that phospho-gCap39 is preferentially associated with nuclei and suggest that phosphorylation of gCap39 is functionally significant."
https://openalex.org/W1556148269,"Molecular properties of superoxide (O2-)-producing cytochrome b558 purified from neutrophils were investigated focusing on the mechanism of the catalytic reaction. The purified cytochrome, which was depleted of FAD, exhibited high O2(-)-generating activity with consumption of NADPH in the presence of microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. Exogenous additions of CO, CN-, or N3- had no effect on the enzymatic activity. Potentiometric titration of the ferric-ferrous couple of the cytochrome showed that the midpoint reduction potential was -255 mV at pH 7.4. When the reaction of the reduced cytochrome with O2 was analyzed by stopped flow and rapid scanning spectrophotometry, the ferrous form was found to be converted to the ferric form at a rate constant of 9.3 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 at 10 degrees C without showing formation of an oxygenated intermediate. EPR measurement of the ferric cytochrome at 10 K showed that the electronic spin state was in a low spin with g values of 3.2, 2.05, and 1.5. These results suggest that the heme in a six-coordinated low spin state catalyzes one electron reduction of O2 without ligation of O2 to the heme iron during the catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1485514804,"The submitochondrial location of the NAD+ glycohydrolase (NADase) and its role in mitochondrial ADP-ribosyl transfer reactions were investigated in isolated rat liver mitochondria. The NADase catalyzes the hydrolysis of NAD+ to ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. Hydrolysis of intramitochondrial NAD+ has been suggested to be the first step in a nonenzymatic mono(ADP-ribosylation) by free ADP-ribose of an inner membrane-associated acceptor peptide and that this protein is involved in regulating calcium efflux from mitochondria during exposure to oxidants. The results of the present study indicate that mitochondrial NADase activity lies outside the matrix space, however. This was determined by assessing the rates of hydrolysis of externally added NAD+ by intact mitochondria and comparing these rates with those obtained when the mitochondria were permeabilized with detergent. No significant difference was observed in the rate of NAD+ hydrolysis when detergent was added indicating that NAD+ hydrolysis by mitochondria does not necessitate its access to the matrix space. The submitochondrial location of the NADase was investigated further by digitonin titration of isolated mitochondria. Digitonin titration of the mitochondria released NADase activity with the outer membrane marker, monoamine oxidase. The digitonin titration data also suggest that the outer membrane is the exclusive location of the NADase. The incorporation of radioactive label derived from [3H]NAD+ into submitochondrial particles proceeds at comparable rates in the absence or presence of NADase activity, indicating that the production of free ADP-ribose is not necessary for intramitochondrial ADP-ribosyl transfer reactions. Thus the conclusions of this study suggest that due to the submitochondrial location of the NADase, it does not participate in intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotide hydrolysis or nonenzymatic mono(ADP-ribosylation) during oxidative stress in mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W2060438079,"Myoballs were cultured from muscle biopsies of patients having Becker-type recessive generalized myotonia (RGM). Single-channel recordings showed that the conductance of the ""intermediate"" Cl- channel, the Cl- channel having the highest membrane density and accounting for most of the Cl- conductance in myoballs, was reduced to about 50%. All other channel parameters tested, such as gating properties, ion selectivity, and regulatory pathways, were not different from controls. Two other Cl- channel types were only rarely observed and did not seem different from controls. Also, the macroscopic Cl- conductance measured with tight-seal whole-cell recording was smaller than controls, particularly in the positive membrane potential domain. These results might explain myotonia in RGM on the single-channel level."
https://openalex.org/W2108120335,"A lysed preparation of isolated insulin secretory granules efficiently cleaved murine proopiomelanocortin (mPOMC) at physiologically important Lys-Arg processing sites. This processing was mostly attributed to an activity that co-eluted with the proinsulin processing type-II endopeptidase from anion exchange chromatography (Lys-Arg-directed; Davidson, H. W., Rhodes, C. J., and Hutton, J. C. (1988) Nature 333, 93-96). The principal peptide hormone products generated by the insulin secretory granule lysate were identified by specific radioimmunoassay and NH2-terminal microsequencing analysis of high performance liquid chromatography-separated products as alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, corticotropin-like intermediate, gamma-lipotropin, beta-endorphin-(1-31), 18-kDa NH2-terminal fragment and, to a lesser extent, adrenocorticotrophin and beta-lipotropin. This processing had an acidic pH optimum (pH 5-5.5) and was Ca(2+)-dependent (K0.5 activation = 5-80 microM). With increasing Ca2+ concentrations there was an increase in the extent to which mPOMC was processed. The in vitro processing of mPOMC by the insulin secretory granule endopeptidase activity reported here is in excellent agreement with the in vivo processing of this prohormone by a combination of PC2 and PC3, candidates of prohormone endpeptidase, in gene transfer studies with cells that express the regulated secretory pathway (Thomas, L., Leduc, R., Thorne, B. A., Smeekens, S. S., Steiner, D. F., and Thomas, G. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 5297-5301)."
https://openalex.org/W1532564319,"Pituitary-derived trophic hormones regulate cell-type-specific expression of VL30 retrotransposons in tissues that are engaged in steroidogenesis. We show that adrenocorticotropic hormone and forskolin induced VL30 transcription in the steroidogenic adrenal cell line Y1 and that the transcriptional activation was cell type- and protein kinase A-dependent. Three novel cAMP-responsive elements (CREs), within the VL30 long terminal repeat, were identified and shown to activate transcription synergistically when templates bearing multiple sites were compared with templates bearing a single site. This type of regulation was evident only in forskolin-treated cells, and the response elements were found to be inactive as mediators of constitutive transcription. In vitro binding analyses indicated that a consensus CRE and the nonconsensus VL30 CREs differ with respect to binding affinity and specificity to a number of nuclear factors that were identified to be related to proteins within the CREB, Jun, and C/EBP families of transcription factors. The relatively low affinity and/or a restricted binding specificity of the VL30 CREs made it possible to detect forskolin-induced binding of CREB- and Jun-related proteins to these sequences. We suggest that cAMP-induced transcription, specific for steroidogenic cells, can be mediated by a novel type of nonconsensus CREs and that the mechanism for this type of gene regulation is distinct from that mediated through a consensus CRE. We also report the identification of a novel factor, distinct from previously characterized CRE-binding proteins, that constitutively binds to the identified CREs."
https://openalex.org/W1577670416,"The treatment of primary cultures of bovine adrenocortical cells with nanomolar concentrations of ACTH induces a 10-fold increase in the synthesis of a secreted protein of apparent molecular mass 195 kDa on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. This corticotropin-induced secreted protein (CISP) appears to be an oligomeric calcium-binding protein. Its secretion under serum-free culture conditions is sustained over 4 days in the continuous presence of ACTH. Induction of CISP secretion by ACTH is mimicked by cAMP analogs and adenylate cyclase activators. We report here the purification of CISP to apparent homogeneity with an overall yield of 43% using a combination of heparin-agarose and Mono-Q chromatographies. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence and the sequence of several tryptic peptides revealed that CISP is structurally related to the members of the thrombospondin (TSP) family. Among these members, bovine CISP appeared to be more homologous to mouse TSP2 (85% identity in the 29 amino acid long NH2-terminal sequence) than to TSP1 (18% identity in the same region). We also observed that CISP binds Ca2+ and is an adhesive protein for bovine adrenocortical cells. Thus, CISP possesses both structural and functional properties of thrombospondins. Whether CISP represents the bovine form of TSP2 or a novel member of the expanding thrombospondin family will need to be elucidated by cloning and sequencing of a larger portion of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1594956479,"beta, gamma-Bidentate CrATP, a stable exchange-inert metal-nucleotide analog, was used as a probe of the conformation of the substrates at the active site of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). The paramagnetic effects of Cr3+ on the longitudinal relaxation rates (1/T1p) of the 1H, 31P, and 13C nuclei of 3-phospho-D-glycerate (3PGA) were examined to determine the distances between enzyme-bound CrATP and the nuclei of 3PGA in the ternary PGK.CrATP.3PGA complex. Kinetic studies indicated that Ki(CrATP) was dependent on the concentration of 3PGA that was abolished in the presence of activator sulfate ion. Similarly, NMR studies showed that the environment of CrATP bound at the active site was altered by the presence of sulfate ion. The determined metal-to-nucleus distances show the close proximity of the substrates at the active site of PGK, which is consistent with a hinge-bending mechanism of the enzyme for bringing the two substrates together. Additionally, the presence of an activating concentration of sulfate was observed to cause significant changes in both the relative Cr(3+)-to-3PGA distances and the overall conformation of 3PGA when compared to the findings in the absence of sulfate. This is consistent with the active site being in a less closed configuration when sulfate is present. Under both conditions, models can be constructed that allow for direct transfer of a phosphoryl group between the bound substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1537485228,"Transfection of primate cells with a 6.4-kilobase murine genomic DNA fragment (called ouabain resistance gene or MOR6.5) has been shown previously to confer ouabain resistance (Levenson, R., Racaniello, V., Albritton, L., and Housman, D. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 1489-1493). The mechanism by which this sequence can transfer ouabain resistance remains unclear. In order to further investigate this mechanism, we determined the full-length nucleotide sequence of MOR6.5. Other than mouse repetitive domains, this DNA does not have significant homology with any coding sequence in GenBank. Although potential open reading frames and polyadenylation signals were found, we were unable to detect an MOR6.5 transcript in CV-1 or COS-1 cells transfected with this DNA, either at early or late times following transfection. We show that in early passages of MOR6.5 transfectants which were under ouabain-selective pressure and still contained MOR6.5 DNA sequence, mRNAs for both alpha 1- and beta 1-subunits of the Na,K-ATPase were amplified approximately 10-fold, compared to parental CV-1 cells. These results suggest that MOR6.5 may rescue the cells from ouabain toxicity by inducing transient up-regulation of the messages for the Na,K-ATPase. This might prolong cell survival on ouabain until mutations in the alpha 1-subunit occur, which permanently reduce ouabain inhibition of the pump (Cantley, L. G., Zhou, X.-M., Cunha, M., Epstein, J., and Cantley, L. C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17271-17278). Possible mechanisms for the up-regulation of transcription based on sequence similarities found between MOR6.5 and the 5'-flanking regions of alpha 1- and beta 1-subunit genes are discussed."
