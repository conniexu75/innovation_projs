https://openalex.org/W1528977425,"Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) was previously shown to release Ca2+ from a nonmitochondrial store in sea urchin eggs. In this study, egg homogenates and purified microsomes were monitored with either fura 2 or Ca2+-sensitive minielectrodes to determine whether other stimuli would induce Ca2+ release. Pyridine nucleotides (whose concentrations are known to change at fertilization) were found to release nearly as much Ca2+ as did IP3. Average releases/ml of homogenate were: 0.6 microM IP3, 10.9 nmol of Ca2+; 50 microM NADP, 7.3 nmol of Ca2+; and 100 microM NAD, 6.5 nmol of Ca2+ (n = 6). Specificity was demonstrated by screening a series of other phosphorylated metabolites, and none was found to reproducibly release Ca2+. Calcium release induced by IP3 or NADP was immediate, whereas a lag of 1-4 min occurred with NAD. This lag before NAD-induced Ca2+ release led to the discovery that a soluble egg factor (Mr greater than 100,000) converts NAD into a highly active metabolite that releases Ca2+ without a lag. The NAD metabolite (E-NAD) was purified to homogeneity by high pressure liquid chromatography and produced half-maximal Ca2+ release at about 40 nM. Injection of E-NAD into intact eggs produced both an increase in intracellular Ca2+ (as assayed with indo-1) and a cortical reaction. Following Ca2+ release by each of the active agents (IP3, NAD, and NADP), the homogenates resequestered the released Ca2+ but were desensitized to further addition of the same agent. A series of desensitization experiments showed that homogenates desensitized to any two of these agents still responded to the third, indicating the presence of three independent Ca2+ release mechanisms. This is further supported by experiments using Percoll density gradient centrifugation in which NADP-sensitive microsomes were partially separated from those sensitive to IP3 and NAD."

https://openalex.org/W1975812938,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) increases the incorporation of fibronectin and type I collagen into the extracellular matrix of fibroblasts and epithelial cells and enhances the attachment of thymocytes onto a fibronectin substratum. Investigation of the molecular basis for these effects showed that TGF-β elevates specifically the expression of cell adhesion protein receptors. Treatment of cells with either form of TGF-β, TGF-β1, or TGF-β2, increases the rate of receptor synthesis and the level of receptors on the cell surface. TGF-β acts via two complementary mechanisms, elevation of receptor mRNA and faster kinetics of receptor β subunit precursor to product conversion. The results show that the expression of cell adhesion receptors is susceptible to pretranslational and posttranslational regulation by factors that control cell morphology, proliferation, and differentiation such as TGF-β."
https://openalex.org/W2044075747,"Cultured NIH 3T3 cells devoid of endogenous EGF receptors were transfected with cDNA constructs encoding either the human EGF receptor or an EGF receptor mutant in which Lys721, a key residue in the ATP binding site, was replaced with an alanine residue. The mutant receptor was properly processed, and it displayed both high- and low-affinity surface binding sites. Unlike the wild-type receptor, the mutant receptor did not possess intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity. The initial rate of EGF internalization was similar for wild-type and mutant EGF receptors. Surprisingly, the mutant receptors were not down regulated, but appeared to recycle in transfected cells. These data suggest that degradation of normal EGF receptors after endocytosis is due to the kinase activity endogenous to this receptor. A single amino acid substitution rendered a ""down-regulated"" receptor into a receptor that can recycle from cytoplasmic compartment back to the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W1967178181,"The genome of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 contains at least eight genes, of which three (sor, R, and 3′orf) have no known function. In this study, the role of the sor gene was examined by constructing a series of proviral genomes of HIV-1 that either lacked the coding sequences for sor or contained point mutations in sor. Analysis of four such mutants revealed that although each clone could generate morphologically normal virus particles upon transfection, the mutant viruses were limited in their capacity to establish stable infection. Virus derived from transfection of Cos-1 cells (OKT4-) with sor mutant proviral DNA's was resistant to transmission to OKT4+ ""susceptible"" cells under cell-free conditions, and was transmitted poorly by coculture. In contrast, virus derived from clones with an intact sor frame was readily propagated by either approach. Normal amounts of gag-, env-, and pol-derived proteins were produced by all four mutants and assays in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells indicated that their trans-activating capacity was intact and comparable with wild type. Thus the sor gene, although not absolutely required in HIV virion formation, influences virus transmission in vitro and is crucial in the efficient generation of infectious virus. The data also suggest that sor influences virus replication at a novel, post-translational stage and that its action is independent of the regulatory genes tat and trs."
https://openalex.org/W1966644054,"BSF-1/interleukin-4, a product of activated T cells, has multiple biological activities that affect cells of most hematopoietic lineages. Among these is the ability of BSF-1 to costimulate the growth of mast cells and regulate the production of IgE. We demonstrate here that BSF-1 mRNA is expressed by a majority of transformed mast cell lines and by 5 IL-3-dependent non-transformed mast cell lines. BSF-1 activity, including the ability to enhance the growth of IL-3-dependent mast cells, was detected in the supernatants of transformed mast cells. The role of BSF-1 as a mast cell growth factor, its constitutive production by transformed mast cells, and the lack of IL-3 production by most of these cells raise the possibility that BSF-1 may act as an autocrine growth factor for some transformed mast cells. Furthermore, production of BSF-1 mRNA by nontransformed cells indicates that mast cells may be an important physiologic source of this factor."
https://openalex.org/W1534544965,"A monoclonal antibody (B-5G10) was produced which specifically recognizes the Mr 150,000/130,000 VLA-4 complex on the surface of human cells. Cross-linking studies indicated that the Mr 150,000 alpha 4 subunit of VLA-4 is in noncovalent 1:1 association with the Mr 130,000 VLA beta subunit. In the absence of cross-linking, the VLA-4 alpha 4 beta subunit complex was easily dissociated, especially in Nonidet P-40 detergent, or at elevated pH (above 8.0). Studies of dissociated subunits showed that B-5G10 recognizes an epitope on the Mr 150,000 alpha 4 subunit of VLA-4, whereas the beta subunit is immunologically identical to the Mr 130,000 beta subunit common to all VLA heterodimers. VLA-4 is widely distributed on hematopoietic cells, including thymocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes, monocytes, activated T cells, T and B lymphoblastoid cell lines, and myeloid cell lines. However, VLA-4 is only weakly expressed on most adherent cell lines tested. Immunoprecipitates of VLA-4 often contain additional proteins of Mr 80,000 and Mr 70,000. These are probably derived from the Mr 150,000 alpha 4 subunit because: 1) they are both recognized by anti-alpha 4 sera, but not anti-beta sera; 2) the sum of their sizes is equal to the size of alpha 4; 3) they are selectively coexpressed with alpha 4 and not other VLA alpha subunits; 4) the Mr 80,000 protein has an identical NH2-terminal sequence to alpha 4; 5) like alpha 4, the Mr 70,000 and 80,000 peptides can variably associate with the VLA beta subunit; and 6) trypsin appears to cleave the Mr 150,000 alpha 4 subunit into products of Mr 70,000 and 80,000."

https://openalex.org/W2050329524,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent polypeptide mitogen originally isolated from the adult male mouse submaxillary gland. It also acts as a gastrointestinal hormone. EGF-immunoreactive material has recently been identified within neuronal fibers and terminals in rodent brain. In the present study, EGF was found to enhance survival and process outgrowth of primary cultures of subneocortical telencephalic neurons of neonatal rat brain in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was observed with EGF concentrations as low as 100 picograms per milliliter (0.016 nanomolar) and was dependent on the continuous presence of EGF in the medium. Similar effects were observed with basic fibroblast growth factor, but several other growth-promoting substances, including other mitogens for glial elements, were without effect. Thus EGF, in addition to its mitogenic and hormonal activities, may act as a neurite elongation and maintenance factor for select neurons of the rodent central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2081260818,"Expression of c-myb proto-oncogene messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein has been detected principally in tumors and in normal tissue of hematopoietic origin. In each hematopoietic lineage examined, expression of the c-myb gene is markedly downregulated during hematopoietic maturation. However, the mechanism by which differential expression of the c-myb gene is regulated is not known. In murine B-lymphoid tumor cell lines, the amount of steady-state c-myb mRNA is 10 to more than 100 times greater in pre-B cell lymphomas than in B cell lymphomas and plasmacytomas. The downregulation of c-myb mRNA correlates with events at the pre-B cell-B cell junction. Differential expression of c-myb mRNA levels detected between a pre-B cell lymphoma and a mature B cell lymphoma is now shown to be mediated by a block to transcription elongation in the first intron of the c-myb locus. In addition, this developmentally regulated difference in transcriptional activity is correlated with alterations in higher order chromatin structure as reflected by changes in the patterns of hypersensitivity to deoxyribonuclease I at the 5' end of the c-myb transcription unit. Regulation of transcription elongation may provide a more sensitive mechanism for rapidly increasing and decreasing mRNA levels in response to external stimuli than regulation of the initiation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2007202768,"The protein portion of the immunosuppressive glycoprotein uromodulin is identical to the Tamm-Horsfall urinary glycoprotein and is synthesized in the kidney. Evidence that the glycoproteins are the same is based on amino acid sequence identity, immunologic cross-reactivity, and tissue localization to the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Nucleic acid sequencing of clones for uromodulin isolated from a complementary DNA bank from human kidney predicts a protein 639 amino acids in length, including a 24--amino acid leader sequence and a cysteine-rich mature protein with eight potential glycosylation sites. Uromodulin and preparations of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein bind to recombinant murine interleukin-1 (rIL-1) and human rIL-1 alpha, rIL-1 beta, and recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF). Uromodulin isolated from urine of pregnant women by lectin adherence is more immunosuppressive than material isolated by the original salt-precipitation protocol of Tamm and Horsfall. Immunohistologic studies demonstrate that rIL-1 and rTNF bind to the same area of the human kidney that binds to antiserum specific for uromodulin. Thus, uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein) may function as a unique renal regulatory glycoprotein that specifically binds to and regulates the circulating activity of a number of potent cytokines, including IL-1 and TNF."

https://openalex.org/W2033214263,"The bcl-2 and c-myc proto-oncogenes are brought into juxtaposition with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in particular B-cell lymphomas, resulting in high levels of constitutive accumulation of their messenger RNAs. Precisely how the products of the bcl-2 and c-myc genes contribute to tumorigenesis is unknown, but observations that c-myc expression is rapidly induced in nonneoplastic lymphocytes upon stimulation of proliferation raise the possibility that this proto-oncogene is involved in the control of normal cellular growth. In addition to c-myc, the bcl-2 proto-oncogene also was expressed in normal human B and T lymphocytes after stimulation with appropriate mitogens. Comparison of the regulation of the expression of these proto-oncogenes demonstrated marked differences and provided evidence that, in contrast to c-myc, levels of bcl-2 messenger RNA are regulated primarily through transcriptional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1976645516,"Increased levels of intracellular calcium at either pre- or postsynaptic sites are thought to precede changes in synaptic strength. Thus, to induce long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, periods of intense synaptic stimulation would have to transiently raise the levels of cytosolic calcium at postsynaptic sites—dendritic spines in the majority of cases. Since direct experimental verification of this hypothesis is not possible at present, calcium levels have been studied by numerically solving the appropriate electro-diffusion equations for two different postsynaptic structures. Under the assumption that voltage-dependent calcium channels are present on dendritic spines, free intracellular calcium in spines can reach micromolar levels after as few as seven spikes in 20 milliseconds. Moreover, a short, but high-frequency, burst of presynaptic activity is more effective in raising levels of calcium and especially of the calcium-calmodulin complex than sustained low-frequency activity. This behavior is different from that seen at the soma of a typical vertebrate neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2078172887,"Vaccinia virus recombinants that express cloned genes encoding antigens of unrelated infectious agents, such as hepatitis B virus1 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)2,3, provide a new approach to the development of live vaccines. Although there is evidence that genetically engineered vaccinia viruses have reduced pathogenicity4 a major obstacle to their use as vaccines is that severe complications can occur after vaccination, especially in immunodeficient individuals5,6. We describe here a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing murine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and show that athymic nude mice infected with the recombinant virus resolve the virus infection rapidly whereas mice infected with control virus develop a progressive vaccinal disease. By incorporating the gene for IL-2 in live virus vaccines it may be possible to prevent the severe complications that arise in recipients with an impaired immune system."
https://openalex.org/W1548784534,"We have identified four discrete proteolytic fragments of von Willebrand factor (vWF) that define two collagen-binding domains. Two of the fragments tested, T 96 kDa and T 55 kDa, were generated by digestion with trypsin, and two, Fragments I and III, with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The larger Fragment III, a disulfide-linked homodimer, extends between residues 1 and 1365 of the 2050-residue vWF subunit and comprises the sequence of all the others. T 96 kDa, also a disulfide-linked homodimer, extends between residues 449 and 728. T 55 kDa and Fragment I, both single-chain polypeptides, have a partial sequence overlap corresponding to residues 911-1114, and together extend from residue 730 to 1365. The ability of the fragments to interfere with the vWF-collagen interaction was evaluated by measuring inhibition of 125I-labeled vWF binding to fibrillar bovine collagen types I and III. All the four fragments tested inhibited binding. Native conformation was essential for expression of this function; denaturation with guanidine hydrochloride and reduction of disulfide bonds resulted in marked reduction or complete loss, respectively, of the inhibitory activity at all the concentrations tested. Two monoclonal antibodies were prepared, one directed against T 96 kDa and the other against Fragment I. Both antibodies partially inhibited vWF binding to collagen, and their inhibitory effect was enhanced when they were used together. 125I-Labeled Fragment I bound to collagen in a saturable manner, and the binding was completely blocked by both T 96 kDa and T 55 kDa. Thus, we have identified at least two distinct functional domains of vWF that concurrently mediate the vWF-collagen interaction. The two domains appear to share a common recognition site on collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1608606583,"The present studies were conducted to determine whether luteinizing hormone (LH), a hormone which increases intracellular cAMP, also increases messengers derived from inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in isolated bovine luteal cells. In luteal cells prelabeled with 32PO4, LH provoked increases in labeling of phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, and polyphosphatidylinositol (PIP). No reductions in 32P-prelabeled PIP and PIP2 were observed in LH-treated cells. In luteal cells prelabeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol, LH provoked rapid (10-30 s) and sustained (up to 60 min) increases in the levels of inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (IP, IP2, and IP3, respectively. IP3 was formed more rapidly than IP2 or IP following LH treatment. In addition, LH increased (50%) levels of [3H]inositol phospholipids in 30-min incubations. LiCl (10 mM) enhanced inositol phosphate accumulation in response to LH. Maximal increases in IP3 occurred at 1-10 micrograms/ml of LH. Similar temporal and dose-response relationships were observed for LH-stimulated IP3 and cAMP accumulation. However, exogenous cAMP (8-bromo-cAMP, 5 mM) and forskolin (10 microM) had no effect on inositol phosphate synthesis. The initial (1 min) effects of LH on IP3 and cAMP were independent of extracellular calcium concentrations, whereas the sustained (5 min) effect of LH on IP3, but not cAMP, was dependent on a source of extracellular calcium. LH-stimulated progesterone synthesis was also dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. LH induced rapid and concentration-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i as measured by Quin 2 fluorescence. The LH-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were maximal within 30 s (approximately 2-fold) and remained elevated for at least 10 min. In Ca2+-free media containing 2 mM [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid, LH was still able to increase [Ca2+]i, but the increase was slightly less in magnitude and of shorter duration (2-4 min). These findings demonstrate that LH can rapidly raise levels of IP3 and [Ca2+]i, as well as, cAMP in bovine luteal cells. These findings suggest that at least two second messenger systems exist to mediate the action of LH in the corpus luteum."
https://openalex.org/W1550978696,"Glucocorticoids initiate a cytolytic process in lymphoid cells that is characteristic of programmed cell death. In vivo treatment of adrenalectomized rats with glucocorticoids results in the rapid degradation of the thymocyte genome at internucleosomal sites. This DNA degradation occurs prior to cell death, and considerable evidence indicates that this nucleolytic event is central to the initiation of lymphocytolysis. To further characterize this process, we have searched for the products in thymocytes which may be responsible for steroid-induced DNA degradation. Adrenalectomized rats were treated in vivo with dexamethasone or a vehicle control; nuclear thymocyte proteins were extracted with 0.6 M NaCl and analyzed for protein content or nuclease activity on sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gels containing calf thymus DNA. Glucocorticoid treatment resulted in the induction of two major protein families, a 30-32-kDa protein doublet and a series of 3-4 proteins of 12-19 kDa, both of which express prominent DNase activity. Induction of the lower molecular weight nucleases increased with time after steroid treatment and paralleled the time course of glucocorticoid-mediated DNA degradation. Nuclease induction was blocked by the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486, indicating a steroid receptor-mediated process. When nuclei from glucocorticoid-resistant cells were incubated with nuclear extracts from glucocorticoid-treated rats, the DNA was cleaved at internucleosomal sites, whereas extracts from vehicle-treated animals were virtually inactive. Based on these findings we propose that glucocorticoids, acting via a receptor-mediated pathway, induce a nucleolytic lysis gene product(s) responsible for lymphocytolysis."
https://openalex.org/W96728624,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) were shown previously to be mitogenic for human fibroblasts. Here we show that recombinant human TNF and recombinant human IL-1 alpha increase steady state levels of c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogene mRNAs in quiescent human FS-4 fibroblasts. Proto-oncogene mRNA levels were enhanced within 20 min of TNF or IL-1 addition, peaked at 30 min, and declined to undetectable levels (c-fos) or basal levels (c-myc) by 60 or 90 min. A similar rapid increase in c-fos and c-myc mRNA was seen in quiescent FS-4 cells exposed to cycloheximide. However, in the presence of cycloheximide, both proto-oncogene mRNA levels continued to rise for at least 90 min. The transient nature of the increase in c-myc mRNA levels appears to be a response characteristic for TNF and IL-1 because in quiescent FS-4 cells exposed to 10% fetal bovine serum, steady state levels of c-myc mRNA remained elevated for at least 4 h."
https://openalex.org/W2019927412,"A retroviral vector was used to insert human alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) complementary DNA into the genome of mouse fibroblasts to create a clonal population of mouse fibroblasts secreting human alpha 1AT. After demonstrating that this clone of fibroblasts produced alpha 1AT after more than 100 population doublings in the absence of selection pressure, the clone was transplanted into the peritoneal cavities of nude mice. When the animals were evaluated 4 weeks later, human alpha 1AT was detected in both sera and the epithelial surface of the lungs. The transplanted clone of fibroblasts could be recovered from the peritoneal cavities of those mice and demonstrated to still be producing human alpha 1AT. Thus, even after removal of selective pressure, a single clone of retroviral vector-infected cells that expressed an exogenous gene in vitro, continued to do so in vivo, and when recovered, continued to produce the product of the exogenous gene."
https://openalex.org/W2135277567,"The Ea MHC class II gene with 1.4 kb of 5′-flanking and 0.5 kb of 3′-flanking sequences was introduced into (H-2b × s)F2 mice, which do not express their endogenous Ea gene. The transgene was expressed in thymic tissue and in adherent spleen cells and was induced in peritoneal exudate cells by α-interferon. In contrast to the normal Ea gene, there was no expression in B lymphocytes. Since transgenic animals made with constructs containing 3.2 kb and 2 kb of 5′-flanking sequences show normal expression pattern of the Ea gene, it appears that deletion of 5′-flanking sequences between −1.4 kb and −2 kb inactivated or eliminated regulatory sequences required for expression of Ea specifically in B cells. The presence of pBR327 DNA linked to the −1.4 kb Ea transgene suppresses expression in peripheral adherent cells, yielding mice expressing Ea only in the thymus. These mice appear to be tolerant to I-E, as measured in mixed leukocyte response experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1604917383,"The dynamics of the T cell antigen receptor on a murine antigen specific T cell hybridoma have been analyzed using a monoclonal anti-receptor antibody. When this antibody, A2B4-2, is bound to surface receptors, no internalization is seen at 4 degrees C. Upon warming to 37 degrees C, between 20 and 30% of the antibody molecules are internalized over 20-30 min as measured by sensitivity to external acid. This level of internalization is identical if monovalent Fab fragments are used. In contrast, cross-linking of the anti-receptor antibody with a second antibody leads to rapid internalization of 100% of prebound surface A2B4-2. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) leads to the rapid internalization of up to 65% of the surface A2B4-2 or A2B4-2 Fab fragments. This effect requires protein kinase C and can be completely inhibited by depleting this kinase from the cells by long term treatment with high doses of PMA. Pretreatment of the T cells with PMA leads to a 40-50% drop in surface T cell antigen receptor expression. Despite the loss of surface receptors, the uptake of A2B4-2 in PMA-treated cells at 37 degrees C is identical to that seen in control cells. The total uptake of A2B4-2 at 37 degrees C is 25-30% greater than the number of surface receptors in control cells and about 100-150% greater than the number of surface receptors in PMA-treated cells. At steady state the percentage of total A2B4-2 on the cell surface is 75% for control cells and 38% for PMA-treated cells. The good agreement of these numbers with the percent internalization of a cohort of surface receptors suggests that all receptors are constantly cycling. The effect of PMA is to alter the kinetic parameters of this cycling, thus changing the steady state distribution of receptors between the plasma membrane and internal, presumably endosomal compartments. Measurement of initial rates of internalization suggests that the PMA effect can be largely explained by an increase in the internalization rate constant."
https://openalex.org/W1533778318,"Growth-arrested human fibroblasts respond to mitogenic stimulation with a rapid, transient increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+. This event may be crucial to the activation of Na/H exchange and subsequent DNA synthesis. Previous studies have implicated calmodulin (CaM) as a possible mediator of the effects of Ca2+ on these processes. here, we demonstrate that a specific CaM-dependent protein kinase (CaM-PK) system is rapidly activated in quiescent fibroblasts stimulated by a variety of mitogens. Cytoplasmic extracts of two human fibroblast cell types contained a major Ca2+-stimulated phosphoprotein of Mr 100,000 and pI 6.8 (Mr 100,000). This protein was shown by peptide mapping and immunological criteria to be identical to the prominent CaM-PK III substrate previously identified in a number of mammalian cells and tissues (Palfrey, H. C. (1983) FEBS Lett. 157, 183-190; Nairn, A.C., Bhagat, B., and Palfrey, H.C. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 7939-7943). Stimulation of 32P-labeled serum-deprived fibroblasts with serum, individual growth factors (bradykinin, vasopressin, and epidermal growth factor), or Ca2+ ionophores resulted in a rapid 2- to 10-fold increase in the phosphorylation of Mr 100,000 as determined by immunoprecipitation using polyclonal antibodies. With serum or individual growth factors, the effect peaked at 0.5-1 min then declined back to base line within 5 min. Time course studies showed that the phosphorylation state of Mr 100,000 closely paralleled but lagged slightly behind the Ca2+ transient (measured with fura-2). Thus, dephosphorylation of Mr 100,000 must follow shortly after Ca2+ levels begin to decline. The effects of serum, bradykinin, and vasopressin on both the rise in intracellular Ca2+ and the phosphorylation of Mr 100,000 were independent of external Ca2+, whereas the effects of epidermal growth factor and A23187 required external Ca2+. Phosphorylation of Mr 100,000 in intact cells took place on threonine residues, a major portion occurring in the same major phosphopeptide found in the protein labeled in vitro. These results show that mitogenic activation of human fibroblasts leads to the binding of Ca2+ to CaM and the subsequent activation of CaM-dependent processes."
https://openalex.org/W1997393065,"An integrating x-ray area detector that operates on the basis of laser-stimulated luminescence was used in a diffraction study of muscle contraction. The area detector has a dynamic range of 1 to 105, a sensitivity about 60 times greater with approximately 1/300 as much fog background as x-ray film. It is erasable and reusable but, like film, can integrate at a practically unlimited counting rate. The high sensitivity and wide dynamic range of the detector resulted in a sufficient reduction in the exposure time to make possible the recording of a clear x-ray diffraction pattern, with up to 2.0-nanometer axial spacing, from a contracting frog skeletal muscle in as little as 10 seconds with synchrotron radiation. During the isometric contraction of the muscle, most of the actin diffraction lines increased in intensity without noticeable changes in their peak positions. Changes also occurred in diffraction intensities from the myosin heads. The results indicate that during contraction the structure of the actin filaments differs from that in the rigor state, suggesting a possible structural change in the actin subunits themselves; the myosin heads during contraction retain the axial periodicity of the myosin filament and become aligned in a more perpendicular manner to the actin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1569768856,"Angiotensin stimulates rapid and prominent increases in inositol polyphosphates and their metabolites in bovine glomerulosa cells labeled with [3H]inositol. In addition to the early formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins-1,3,4-P3), as well as their intermediate product, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins-1,3,4,5-P4), delayed increases in two new InsP4 isomers were consistently observed by high resolution high performance liquid chromatography. Studies on the metabolism of purified Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 preparations, labeled with [3H]inositol and 32P to monitor sites of dephosphorylation, were performed in permeabilized glomerulosa cells. In addition to rapid degradation of Ins-1,3,4,5-P3 to Ins-1,3,4-P3 and then to Ins-3,4-P2, there was delayed formation of one of the putative InsP4 isomers observed during AII stimulation in intact cells. The kinetics of formation of the new InsP4 isomer, and the lack of phosphate in its 5 position based on isotope ratios, were consistent with its origin from Ins-1,3,4-P3. This was confirmed by the conversion of [3H]Ins-1,3,4-P3 to the new InsP4 isomer in permeabilized cells by a kinase distinct from that which phosphorylates Ins-1,4,5-P3. These results have demonstrated that the dephosphorylation sequence of Ins-1,4,5-P3 metabolism is accompanied by a complex cycle of higher phosphorylations with formation of new intermediates of potential significance in cellular regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1516070458,"Recent evidence has revealed that a highly sensitive and specific guanine nucleotide regulatory process controls intracellular Ca2+ release within N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (Gill, D. L., Ueda, T., Chueh, S. H., and Noel, M. W. (1986) Nature 320, 461-464). The present report documents GTP-induced Ca2+ release within quite distinct cell types, including the DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cell line. GTP-induced Ca2+ release has similar GTP sensitivity and specificity among cells and rapidly mobilizes up to 70% of Ca2+ specifically accumulated within a nonmitochondrial Ca2+-pumping organelle within permeabilized DDT2MF-2 cells. Maximal GTP-induced release of Ca2+ is observed to be greater than inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release (the latter being approximately 30% of total releasable Ca2+). After maximal IP3-induced release, further IP3 addition is ineffective, whereas subsequent addition of GTP further releases Ca2+ to equal exactly the extent of Ca2+ release observed by addition of GTP in the absence of IP3. This suggests that IP3 releases Ca2+ from the same pool as GTP, whereas GTP also releases from an additional pool. The effects of GTP appear to be reversible since simple washing of GTP-treated cells restores their previous Ca2+ uptake properties. Electron microscopic analysis of GTP-treated membrane vesicles reveals their morphology to be unchanged, whereas treatment of vesicles with 3% polyethylene glycol, known to enhance GTP-mediated Ca2+ release, clearly induces close coalescence of membranes. In the presence of 4 mM oxalate, GTP induces a rapid and profound uptake, as opposed to release, of Ca2+. The findings suggest that GTP-activated Ca2+ movement is a widespread phenomenon among cells, which can function on the same Ca2+ pool mobilized by IP3, and although activating Ca2+ movement by a mechanism distinct from IP3, does so via a process that does not appear to involve fusion between membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2008443499,A sea urchin DNA clone complementary to an embryonic messenger RNA whose protein product bears striking homology to the epidermal growth factor family of proteins has been identified and characterized. The structure of the protein is similar to that of previously identified regulatory genes in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis. RNA gel blot hybridization showed a unique temporal pattern of expression of this gene during embryogenesis and transcript enrichment in the embryonic ectoderm. These results suggest that this member of the epidermal growth factor gene family plays a role in early development decisions in sea urchin embryos.
https://openalex.org/W1547341521,"The transferrin receptor cycles rapidly between cell surface and endosomal membrane compartments. Treatment of cultured cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) at 37 degrees C causes a rapid redistribution of transferrin receptors from an intracellular compartment to the cell surface. The effects of EGF and IGF-I on the kinetics of the cycling of the transferrin receptor in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells were compared. The primary site of EGF action was found to be an increase in the rate of transferrin receptor exocytosis. The exocytotic rate constant was measured to be 0.11 min-1 in control cells and 0.33 min-1 in EGF-treated cells. In contrast, IGF-I was found to increase the cell surface expression of transferrin receptors by causing a small increase in the rate of exocytosis (from 0.11 to 0.17 min-1) and a decrease in the rate of endocytosis (from 0.33 to 0.24 min-1). It is concluded that the mechanisms for EGF and IGF-I action to increase the cell surface expression of the transferrin receptor are distinct. A kinetic model of the cycling of the transferrin receptor based on experimentally determined rate constants is presented. The model predicts that a consequence of IGF-I action on transferrin receptor cycling is to decrease the apparent Km for the uptake of diferric transferrin by cells. This prediction is confirmed by direct measurement of the accumulation of 59Fe-labeled diferric transferrin by A431 cells. These data demonstrate that the accumulation of iron by cultured cells is a complex function of the rate of cycling of the transferrin receptor and that this process is under acute regulation by growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1954010972,"Type beta transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) is found in large amounts in bone tissue, and is a potent mitogen for osteoblast-enriched cell cultures obtained from fetal rat parietal bone. Because other local and systemic factors may be presented to bone cells simultaneously with TGF-beta, it is important to understand the effects of this complex growth regulator in such circumstances. Unlike the effects observed in many tissue systems, TGF-beta does not invariably inhibit the mitogenic response of bone cells to other growth promoters. In contrast, other factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and type alpha tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) limit the response of osteoblastic bone cells to TGF-beta. TGF-beta is a much weaker mitogen for fibroblastic cells obtained from fetal rat bone, whereas fetal bovine serum, EGF, bFGF, and TNF-alpha are more potent stimulators. In addition, TGF-beta does not significantly impair the response of the fibroblastic bone cells to the other tested agents. These findings reinforce a role of TGF-beta as an anabolic bone growth regulator, and suggest that its function may be modified by other local or systemic agents that can also affect bone cells."
https://openalex.org/W1489729774,"To investigate possible mechanisms through which 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) affects cell proliferation and differentiation, we have studied the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the binding and mitogenic activity of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in RCJ 1.20 cells, an established, non-tumorigenic cell line derived from 21-day-old fetal rat calvaria. 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused a dose- and time-dependent 2- to 3-fold increase in the number of receptors for EGF. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 metabolites of vitamin D3 were ineffective in eliciting changes in EGF binding. Saturation and Scatchard analyses indicated that an increase in available unoccupied high affinity EGF binding sites was responsible for the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced EGF binding. In addition, 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhanced EGF-dependent growth of RCJ 1.20 cells in soft agar. The potentiation of EGF effects on RCJ 1.20 cell growth by 1,25-(OH)2D3 may be related to the 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of EGF binding. However, the induction of anchorage-independent growth by 1,25-(OH)2D3 appears to be due to the stimulation of transforming growth factor beta-like activity. These results provide a possible explanation for the mechanism whereby the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on cell proliferation and bone metabolism may be mediated."
https://openalex.org/W1532473763,"The heptapeptide Ile-Arg-Ile-Cys-Arg-Lys-Gly-ethyl ester, having the amino acid sequence around the SH1 of myosin heavy chain, was coprecipitated with F-actin after ultracentrifugation. The heptapeptide inhibited the formation of acto-S-1 rigor complex by competing with S-1 for actin. Assuming a simple competitive inhibition, the dissociation constant of acto-heptapeptide complex was evaluated as 0.23 mM. An N-terminal tripeptide derivative from the heptapeptide Ile-Arg-Ile-methyl ester also formed a complex with F-actin with a dissociation constant of 1.1 mM. However, the other piece, Cys-Arg-Lys-Gly-ethyl ester, and a tetrapeptide, Val-Leu-Glu-Gly-ethyl ester, having the sequence adjacent to the N-terminal of the heptapeptide, scarcely bound with F-actin. These results suggest that part of the actin-binding site of myosin heavy chain around SH1 (Katoh, T., Katoh, H., and Morita, F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6723-6727) has the sequence of Ile-Arg-Ile and it is located adjacent to SH1 on its N-terminal side."
https://openalex.org/W2011941338,"The human T cell receptor gamma locus, including eleven variable-region, five joining-region, and two constant-region segments, is contained in 160 kilobases. During T cell somatic development these genes undergo rearrangement by deletion of the sequences separating the variable and joining regions. The molecular map of this locus was completely defined by deletion mapping and restriction mapping. Restriction fragments were resolved by standard agarose electrophoresis and field inversion electrophoresis. These studies demonstrate that the deletions in this locus, which occur during the formation of a functional T cell receptor gamma-chain gene, range from 50 to 145 kilobases in length. These studies also provide a structural basis for understanding the development of the gamma-chain peptide repertoire, and extends the potential of the emerging pulsed-field electrophoretic technology."
https://openalex.org/W1507458844,"We have examined initial assembly of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation on cell surfaces with radiolabeled human factor VIIa and a human fetal lung cell line possessing abundant functional tissue factor activity. Binding of factor VIIa to these cells was observed and was time- and temperature-dependent. Binding of factor VIIa was quantitatively equivalent at 37 and 6 degrees C, although the kinetics of binding differed. The radiolabeled ligand bound by the cell was indistinguishable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis from the factor VIIa offered. Factor VIIa binding was influenced by calcium ions. The binding appears to involve at least two classes of calcium-dependent binding sites. Optimal binding occurred at 2 mM calcium for both classes of sites, and there was inhibition of binding to the high affinity sites at higher calcium. Association of factor VIIa was specific, saturable, had a Kd of 123 +/- 37 pm, and factor VIIa interacted with about 100,000 binding sites per cell. Once established, specific binding was rapidly reversible. Direct cellular binding of human factor X also was observed and was calcium, time- and temperature-dependent. Factor X binding was specific and saturable with half-maximal binding at 87.6 +/- 27.4 nM to 6.03 +/- 1.03 X 10(6) sites per cell. Specific high affinity binding of factor VIIa correlated with generation of factor Xa. A direct linear relationship was observed at low factor VIIa binding; however, at higher bound factor VIIa, the relationship was nonstoichiometric, i.e. less factor Xa was formed per mole of factor VIIa. Expression of specific binding sites for factors VIIa and X provides further substantiation for the molecular assembly hypothesized to initiate the extrinsic coagulation protease cascade on cells."
https://openalex.org/W1603406891,"A method for the extraction of cyclic inositol phosphates in the absence of acid after short incubation times is described. A modified high pressure liquid chromatography method is also described which separates inositol 1,2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate (IcP3), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (I(1,4,5)P3), and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (I(1,3,4)P3). Mouse pancreatic minilobules were preincubated with [3H]inositol for 1 h in the absence of lithium, washed, and incubated without and with carbamylcholine without lithium for various times. On adding carbamylcholine, I(1,4,5)P3 peaked at 10 s, followed by a fall to a steady-state level which was two-thirds the peak value. This level was maintained for 20 min. IcP3, on the other hand, rose very slowly; at 10 s, it was only 5% of I(1,4,5)P3. It continued to rise until it equaled the steady-state level of I(1,4,5)P3 at 20 min. I(1,3,4)P3 rose gradually but at a faster rate than IcP3, peaking at 40 s at the same level as that achieved by I(1,4,5)P3 at that time and then falling in parallel with I(1,4,5)P3. Assuming equal potencies of IcP3 and I(1,4,5)P3 in mobilizing intracellular stores of Ca2+ in pancreatic minilobules, as seen in Limulus photoreceptor cells, platelets, and 3T3 cells, IcP3 would appear to play no messenger role at very early times. Thus, I(1,4,5)P3 should be responsible for almost all of Ca2+ release at very early times (10 s), while at later times (20 min) IcP3 and I(1,4,5)P3 should contribute equally to Ca2+ release. The significance of these results is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1753455118,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) produces uterine contractions in tissues removed from immature and adult rats. EGF produces both an increase in resting tone and the development of rhythmic contractions, and this effect is abolished by treatment with antibodies against EGF. The ED50 for this response is observed at an EGF concentration of 3.5 nm. This in vitro effect of EGF requires treatment of the animals in vivo with estradiol for 24 h before removal of uterine tissue. This effect of estradiol does not appear to be due solely to an induction of tissue EGF receptors. These results demonstrate a new activity of EGF and suggest a previously unrecognized function for this peptide growth factor.— Gardner, R. M.; Lingham, R. B.; Stancel, G. M.

https://openalex.org/W1581672519,"The LSTRA cell line contains an elevated level of a tyrosine protein kinase of apparent molecular weight of 56,000 (pp56Tcell). Analysis of the tryptic fragments of this protein labeled in vivo with 32P shows that it contains four sites of tyrosine phosphorylation and one site of serine phosphorylation. Two of the sites of in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation are also labeled in vitro when membranes are incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP. One of the sites that is labeled in vivo and in vitro (site 1) is identical in sequence with the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation in the transforming protein of the Rous sarcoma virus. Analysis of the sites of in vivo phosphorylation in pp56Tcell from LSTRA cells treated with 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) reveals that this agent induces at least four new sites of serine phosphorylation. Treatment with PMA also causes a selective reduction in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in site 1. Thus PMA causes new sites of serine phosphorylation in pp56Tcell and reduces the amount of phosphate in one of the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1604447247,"The uvsX gene product is essential for DNA repair and general recombination in T4 bacteriophage. The ability of UvsX protein to catalyze the homologous pairing of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in vitro was examined by electron microscopic (EM), nitrocellulose filter binding, and gel electrophoretic methods. Optimal joining was observed at ratios of UvsX protein:ssDNA of 2 nucleotides/protein monomer. At this level, the ssDNA was fully covered by UvsX protein as seen by EM, while the dsDNA appeared protein-free. Using this stoichiometry, the pairing of circular ssDNA with homologous supertwisted dsDNA was found to produce a high frequency of complexes in which a supertwisted dsDNA molecule was joined to a UvsX protein-ssDNA filament over a distance of less than 100 base pairs. These joints were labile to deproteinization and must have been paranemic. Pairing of linear ssDNA containing buried homology to the dsDNA produced identical structures. Pairing of fully homologous linear ssDNA and supertwisted dsDNA yielded D-loop joints (plectonemic) as seen by EM following deproteinization. Both the paranemic and the plectonemic joints were at sites of homology, as demonstrated by restriction cleavage of the complexes. Visualization of the joined complexes prior to deproteinization showed that 50% of the joints had the architecture of the paranemic joints, whereas in the remainder, a topologically relaxed dsDNA circle merged with the UvsX protein-ssDNA filament for a distance of 450 base pairs. The structure of the filament was not visibly altered in this region. These observations are similar, but not identical, to findings in parallel studies utilizing the RecA protein of Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1493326759,"The 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase domain of the trifunctional enzyme C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase appears to undergo a conformational change in the presence of tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates, MgATP, and ammonium ion. The binding of these ligands increases the denaturation temperature of the enzyme by 12 degrees C, abolishes the cold lability of the enzyme, and alters its susceptibility to digestion by chymotrypsin. The results suggest that a conformational change is dependent upon binding of the third glutamate residue of tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates and the beta-phosphoryl group of MgATP. The Km values for MgATP and formate are lowered 3.6- and 520-fold, respectively, when tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate is used as the substrate in place of tetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate. A sensitive coupled assay involving C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase was developed to determine the activity of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase. The assay gives linear rates with the tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates as substrates but not with the monoglutamate form."

https://openalex.org/W1520226413,"Abstract Microcalorimetric titrations of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) skeletal troponin C with Ca2+ were carried out in the absence of Mg2+ at 25 degrees C and at pH 7.0. The observed enthalpy titration curve was divided into three stages. The first stage of the titration (up to 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein) was characterized as an extremely exothermic process (delta H = -52 kJ/mol of site), the second one (titration from 2 to 3 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein) as a weakly endothermic process (delta H = +26 kJ/mol of site), and the final one (over 3 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein) as a moderately exothermic process (delta H = -35 kJ/mol of site). The endothermic process of Ca2+ binding to the third site (the second stage) has the same property as that of the Ca2+ binding to every site of calmodulin but is distinctly different from those of the calmodulin-trifluoperazine complex and parvalbumins. This may suggest that an endothermic nature of Ca2+ binding, the reaction being driven solely by entropy change, is characteristic of the regulatory reactions of Ca2+ binding proteins accompanying the interaction with other proteins. The third Ca2+ binding site of bullfrog troponin C is, therefore, possibly involved in the regulation of muscle contraction."
https://openalex.org/W1539647831,"Soaking frog motor nerve terminals in a hypertonic solution produces an increase in the size of miniature end plate potentials (mepp's) and miniature end plate currents (mepc's) after the preparations are returned to normal Ringer's solution. There is substantial evidence that the size increase occurs because additional acetylcholine (ACh+) is incorporated into the quanta. It has been proposed that ACh+ loading into synaptic vesicles requires a proton gradient. As a step in testing this hypothesis the effects of millimolar concentrations of NH4+, methylamine+, or trimethylamine+ in the extracellular solution on the increase in quantal size were measured. These substances would be expected to accumulate in acid intracellular compartments, which would diminish the acidity. The increase in quantal size was blocked by these substances, in agreement with the idea that the proton gradient is involved in ACh+ accumulation. Tetanic stimulation in solutions containing 5 mM NH4Cl also produces a decrease in quantal size, not seen in controls in NH4+-free solution. The inhibition of transmitter packaging by ammonia may play a role in the neural sequelae of hepatic failure."

Using a modified acid wash technique, cell surface-bound EGF was removed. Utilizing sucrose density centrifugation, the residual cell-associated EGF was separated into plasma membrane-associated and intracellular vesicle-associated forms. Using these procedures we have identified a transient form of cell-associated EGF that is still attached to the plasma membrane but not accessible to the extracellular fluid. This form of EGF appears to be the precursor for endosomic EGF. We suggest that this intermediate form represents the receptor-ligand complex shown by electronmicroscopy to be located in narrow-necked plasma membrane invaginations (Willingham, M.
