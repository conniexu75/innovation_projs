https://openalex.org/W2037269076,"Soil ecosystems harbor the most complex prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities on Earth. Experimental approaches studying these systems usually focus on either the soil community's taxonomic structure or its functional characteristics. Many methods target DNA as marker molecule and use PCR for amplification.Here we apply an RNA-centered meta-transcriptomic approach to simultaneously obtain information on both structure and function of a soil community. Total community RNA is random reversely transcribed into cDNA without any PCR or cloning step. Direct pyrosequencing produces large numbers of cDNA rRNA-tags; these are taxonomically profiled in a binning approach using the MEGAN software and two specifically compiled rRNA reference databases containing small and large subunit rRNA sequences. The pyrosequencing also produces mRNA-tags; these provide a sequence-based transcriptome of the community. One soil dataset of 258,411 RNA-tags of approximately 98 bp length contained 193,219 rRNA-tags with valid taxonomic information, together with 21,133 mRNA-tags. Quantitative information about the relative abundance of organisms from all three domains of life and from different trophic levels was obtained in a single experiment. Less frequent taxa, such as soil Crenarchaeota, were well represented in the data set. These were identified by more than 2,000 rRNA-tags; furthermore, their activity in situ was revealed through the presence of mRNA-tags specific for enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation and CO(2) fixation.This approach could be widely applied in microbial ecology by efficiently linking community structure and function in a single experiment while avoiding biases inherent in other methods."
https://openalex.org/W2162723667,"Elevated plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an indicator of microbial translocation from the gut, is a likely cause of systemic immune activation in chronic HIV infection. LPS induces monocyte activation and trafficking into brain, which are key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated dementia (HAD). To determine whether high LPS levels are associated with increased monocyte activation and HAD, we obtained peripheral blood samples from AIDS patients and examined plasma LPS by Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, peripheral blood monocytes by FACS, and soluble markers of monocyte activation by ELISA. Purified monocytes were isolated by FACS sorting, and HIV DNA and RNA levels were quantified by real time PCR. Circulating monocytes expressed high levels of the activation markers CD69 and HLA-DR, and harbored low levels of HIV compared to CD4(+) T-cells. High plasma LPS levels were associated with increased plasma sCD14 and LPS-binding protein (LBP) levels, and low endotoxin core antibody levels. LPS levels were higher in HAD patients compared to control groups, and were associated with HAD independently of plasma viral load and CD4 counts. LPS levels were higher in AIDS patients using intravenous heroin and/or ethanol, or with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection, compared to control groups. These results suggest a role for elevated LPS levels in driving monocyte activation in AIDS, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of HAD, and provide evidence that cofactors linked to substance abuse and HCV co-infection influence these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2062821836,"Extreme climatic conditions may alter historic host-pathogen relationships and synchronize the temporal and spatial convergence of multiple infectious agents, triggering epidemics with far greater mortality than those due to single pathogens. Here we present the first data to clearly illustrate how climate extremes can promote a complex interplay between epidemic and endemic pathogens that are normally tolerated in isolation, but with co-infection, result in catastrophic mortality. A 1994 canine distemper virus (CDV) epidemic in Serengeti lions (Panthera leo) coincided with the death of a third of the population, and a second high-mortality CDV epidemic struck the nearby Ngorongoro Crater lion population in 2001. The extent of adult mortalities was unusual for CDV and prompted an investigation into contributing factors. Serological analyses indicated that at least five “silent” CDV epidemics swept through the same two lion populations between 1976 and 2006 without clinical signs or measurable mortality, indicating that CDV was not necessarily fatal. Clinical and pathology findings suggested that hemoparsitism was a major contributing factor during fatal epidemics. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we measured the magnitude of hemoparasite infections in these populations over 22 years and demonstrated significantly higher levels of Babesia during the 1994 and 2001 epidemics. Babesia levels correlated with mortalities and extent of CDV exposure within prides. The common event preceding the two high mortality CDV outbreaks was extreme drought conditions with wide-spread herbivore die-offs, most notably of Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer). As a consequence of high tick numbers after the resumption of rains and heavy tick infestations of starving buffalo, the lions were infected by unusually high numbers of Babesia, infections that were magnified by the immunosuppressive effects of coincident CDV, leading to unprecedented mortality. Such mass mortality events may become increasingly common if climate extremes disrupt historic stable relationships between co-existing pathogens and their susceptible hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2000183684,"Recent infectious disease models illustrate a suite of mechanisms that can result in lower incidence of disease in areas of higher disease host diversity–the ‘dilution effect’. These models are particularly applicable to human zoonoses, which are infectious diseases of wildlife that spill over into human populations. As many recent emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, the mechanisms that underlie the ‘dilution effect’ are potentially widely applicable and could contribute greatly to our understanding of a suite of diseases. The dilution effect has largely been observed in the context of Lyme disease and the predictions of the underlying models have rarely been examined for other infectious diseases on a broad geographic scale. Here, we explored whether the dilution effect can be observed in the relationship between the incidence of human West Nile virus (WNV) infection and bird (host) diversity in the eastern US. We constructed a novel geospatial contrasts analysis that compares the small differences in avian diversity of neighboring US counties (where one county reported human cases of WNV and the other reported no cases) with associated between-county differences in human disease. We also controlled for confounding factors of climate, regional variation in mosquito vector type, urbanization, and human socioeconomic factors that are all likely to affect human disease incidence. We found there is lower incidence of human WNV in eastern US counties that have greater avian (viral host) diversity. This pattern exists when examining diversity-disease relationships both before WNV reached the US (in 1998) and once the epidemic was underway (in 2002). The robust disease-diversity relationships confirm that the dilution effect can be observed in another emerging infectious disease and illustrate an important ecosystem service provided by biodiversity, further supporting the growing view that protecting biodiversity should be considered in public health and safety plans."
https://openalex.org/W2071133957,"The parkin was first identified as a gene implicated in autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism. Deregulation of the parkin gene, however, has been observed in various human cancers, suggesting that the parkin gene may be important in tumorigenesis. To gain insight into the physiologic role of parkin, we generated parkin−/− mice lacking exon 3 of the parkin gene. We demonstrated here that parkin−/− mice had enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and developed macroscopic hepatic tumors with the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma. Microarray analyses revealed that parkin deficiency caused the alteration of gene expression profiles in the liver. Among them, endogenous follistatin is commonly upregulated in both nontumorous and tumorous liver tissues of parkin-deficient mice. Parkin deficiency resulted in suppression of caspase activation and rendered hepatocytes resistant to apoptosis in a follistatin-dependent manner. These results suggested that parkin deficiency caused enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, resulting in hepatic tumor development, partially through the upregulation of endogenous follistatin. The finding that parkin-deficient mice are susceptible to hepatocarcinogenesis provided the first evidence showing that parkin is indeed a tumor suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2109064685,"Among the ten pharmacological inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) currently in clinical trials, the purine roscovitine (CYC202, Seliciclib) is undergoing phase 2 trials against non-small-cell lung and nasopharyngeal cancers. An extensive medicinal chemistry study, designed to generate more potent analogues of roscovitine, led to the identification of an optimal substitution at the N6 position (compound CR8). An extensive selectivity study (108 kinases) highlights the exquisite selectivity of CR8 for CDK1/2/3/5/7/9. CR8 was 2- to 4-fold more potent than (R)-roscovitine at inhibiting these kinases. Cocrystal structures of (R)-CR8 and (R)-roscovitine with pCDK2/cyclin A showed that both inhibitors adopt essentially identical positions. The cellular effects of CR8 and (R)-roscovitine were investigated in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. CR8 inhibited the phosphorylation of CDK1 and 9 substrates, with a 25–50 times higher potency compared to (R)-roscovitine. CR8 was consistently more potent than (R)-roscovitine at inducing apoptotic cell death parameters: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium reduction (40-fold), lactate dehydrogenase release (35-fold), caspases activation (68-fold) and poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase cleavage (50-fold). This improved cell death-inducing activity of CR8 over (R)-roscovitine was observed in 25 different cell lines. Altogether these results show that second-generation analogues of (R)-roscovitine can be designed with improved antitumor potential."
https://openalex.org/W2024770568,"The use of D2/D3 dopaminergic agonists in Parkinson's disease (PD) may lead to pathological gambling. In a placebo-controlled double-blind study in healthy volunteers, we observed riskier choices in a lottery task after administration of the D3 receptor-preferring agonist pramipexole thus mimicking risk-taking behavior in PD. Moreover, we demonstrate decreased activation in the rostral basal ganglia and midbrain, key structures of the reward system, following unexpected high gains and therefore propose that pathological gambling in PD results from the need to seek higher rewards to overcome the blunted response in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1972907808,"The mRNA of the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 has been reported to be overexpressed in 90% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in over 80% of colon, ovary and uterus carcinomas. Elevated FAT10 expression in malignancies was attributed to transcriptional upregulation upon the loss of p53. Moreover, FAT10 induced chromosome instability in long-term in vitro culture, which led to the hypothesis that FAT10 might be involved in carcinogenesis. In this study we show that interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α synergistically upregulated FAT10 expression in liver and colon cancer cells 10- to 100-fold. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that FAT10 mRNA was significantly overexpressed in 37 of 51 (72%) of human HCC samples and in 8 of 15 (53%) of human colon carcinomas. The FAT10 cDNA sequences in HCC samples were not mutated and intact FAT10 protein was detectable. FAT10 expression in both cancer tissues correlated with expression of the IFN-γ- and TNF-α-dependent proteasome subunit LMP2 strongly suggesting that proinflammatory cytokines caused the joint overexpression of FAT10 and LMP2. NIH3T3 transformation assays revealed that FAT10 had no transforming capability. Taken together, FAT10 qualifies as a marker for an interferon response in HCC and colon carcinoma but is not significantly overexpressed in cancers lacking a proinflammatory environment."
https://openalex.org/W2129977027,"Cumulative evidence supports bidirectional interactions between astrocytes and neurons, suggesting glial involvement of neuronal information processing in the brain. Cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) concentration is important for astrocytes as Ca2+ surges co-occur with gliotransmission and neurotransmitter reception. Cerebral cortex is organized in layers which are characterized by distinct cytoarchitecture. We asked if astrocyte-dominant layer 1 (L1) of the somatosensory cortex was different from layer 2/3 (L2/3) in spontaneous astrocytic Ca2+ activity and if it was influenced by background neural activity. Using a two-photon laser scanning microscope, we compared spontaneous Ca2+ activity of astrocytic somata and processes in L1 and L2/3 of anesthetized mature rat somatosensory cortex. We also assessed the contribution of background neural activity to the spontaneous astrocytic Ca2+ dynamics by investigating two distinct EEG states (“synchronized” vs. “de-synchronized” states). We found that astrocytes in L1 had nearly twice higher Ca2+ activity than L2/3. Furthermore, Ca2+ fluctuations of processes within an astrocyte were independent in L1 while those in L2/3 were synchronous. Pharmacological blockades of metabotropic receptors for glutamate, ATP, and acetylcholine, as well as suppression of action potentials did not have a significant effect on the spontaneous somatic Ca2+ activity. These results suggest that spontaneous astrocytic Ca2+ surges occurred in large part intrinsically, rather than neural activity-driven. Our findings propose a new functional segregation of layer 1 and 2/3 that is defined by autonomous astrocytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2078446518,"The persistent evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) highlights the need for novel vaccination techniques that can quickly and effectively respond to emerging viral threats. We evaluated the use of optimized consensus influenza antigens to provide broad protection against divergent strains of H5N1 influenza in three animal models of mice, ferrets, and non-human primates. We also evaluated the use of in vivo electroporation to deliver these vaccines to overcome the immunogenicity barrier encountered in larger animal models of vaccination.Mice, ferrets and non-human primates were immunized with consensus plasmids expressing H5 hemagglutinin (pH5HA), N1 neuraminidase (pN1NA), and nucleoprotein antigen (pNP). Dramatic IFN-gamma-based cellular immune responses to both H5 and NP, largely dependent upon CD8+ T cells were seen in mice. Hemaggutination inhibition titers classically associated with protection (>1:40) were seen in all species. Responses in both ferrets and macaques demonstrate the ability of synthetic consensus antigens to induce antibodies capable of inhibiting divergent strains of the H5N1 subtype, and studies in the mouse and ferret demonstrate the ability of synthetic consensus vaccines to induce protection even in the absence of such neutralizing antibodies. After challenge, protection from morbidity and mortality was seen in mice and ferrets, with significant reductions in viral shedding and disease progression seen in vaccinated animals.By combining several consensus influenza antigens with in vivo electroporation, we demonstrate that these antigens induce both protective cellular and humoral immune responses in mice, ferrets and non-human primates. We also demonstrate the ability of these antigens to protect from both morbidity and mortality in a ferret model of HPAI, in both the presence and absence of neutralizing antibody, which will be critical in responding to the antigenic drift that will likely occur before these viruses cross the species barrier to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2073766253,"Heterogeneous and uncontrolled differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in embryoid bodies (EBs) limits the potential use of hESCs for cell-based therapies. More efficient strategies are needed for the commitment and differentiation of hESCs to produce a homogeneous population of specific cell types for tissue regeneration applications.We report here that significant chondrocytic commitment of feeder-free cultured human embryonic stem cells (FF-hESCs), as determined by gene expression and immunostaining analysis, was induced by co-culture with primary chondrocytes. Furthermore, a dynamic expression profile of chondrocyte-specific genes was observed during monolayer expansion of the chondrogenically-committed cells. Chondrogenically-committed cells synergistically responded to transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and beta1-integrin activating antibody by increasing tissue mass in pellet culture. In addition, when encapsulated in hydrogels, these cells formed cartilage tissue both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, the absence of chondrocyte co-culture did not result in an expandable cell population from FF-hESCs.The direct chondrocytic commitment of FF-hESCs can be induced by morphogenetic factors from chondrocytes without EB formation and homogenous cartilage tissue can be formed in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2040603601,"Background In order to improve malaria control, and under the aegis of WHO recommendations, many efforts are being devoted to developing new tools for identifying geographic areas with high risk of parasite transmission. Evaluation of the human antibody response to arthropod salivary proteins could be an epidemiological indicator of exposure to vector bites, and therefore to risk of pathogen transmission. In the case of malaria, which is transmitted only by anopheline mosquitoes, maximal specificity could be achieved through identification of immunogenic proteins specific to the Anopheles genus. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the IgG response to the Anopheles gambiae gSG6 protein, from its recombinant form to derived synthetic peptides, could be an immunological marker of exposure specific to Anopheles gambiae bites. Methodology/Principal Findings Specific IgG antibodies to recombinant gSG6 protein were observed in children living in a Senegalese area exposed to malaria. With the objective of optimizing Anopheles specificity and reproducibility, we designed five gSG6-based peptide sequences using a bioinformatic approach, taking into consideration i) their potential antigenic properties and ii) the absence of cross-reactivity with protein sequences of other arthropods/organisms. The specific anti-peptide IgG antibody response was evaluated in exposed children. The five gSG6 peptides showed differing antigenic properties, with gSG6-P1 and gSG6-P2 exhibiting the highest antigenicity. However, a significant increase in the specific IgG response during the rainy season and a positive association between the IgG level and the level of exposure to Anopheles gambiae bites was significant only for gSG6-P1. Conclusions/Significance This step-by-step approach suggests that gSG6-P1 could be an optimal candidate marker for evaluating exposure to Anopheles gambiae bites. This marker could be employed as a geographic indicator, like remote sensing techniques, for mapping the risk of malaria. It could also represent a direct criterion of efficacy in evaluation of vector control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2043894440,"Once thought of as simply an oily barrier that maintains cellular integrity, lipids are now known to play an active role in a large variety of cellular processes. Phosphoinositides are of particular interest because of their remarkable ability to affect many signaling pathways. Ion channels and transporters are an important target of phosphoinositide signaling, but identification of the specific phosphoinositides involved has proven elusive. TRPV1 is a good example; although phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) can potently regulate its activation, we show that phosphatidylinositol (4)-phosphate (PI(4)P) and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P(3)) can as well. To determine the identity of the endogenous phosphoinositide regulating TRPV1, we applied recombinant pleckstrin homology domains to inside-out excised patches. Although a PI(4,5)P(2)-specific pleckstrin homology domain inhibited TRPV1, a PI(3,4,5)P(3)-specific pleckstrin homology domain had no effect. Simultaneous confocal imaging and electrophysiological recording of whole cells expressing a rapamycin-inducible lipid phosphatase also demonstrates that depletion of PI(4,5)P(2) inhibits capsaicin-activated TRPV1 current; the PI(4)P generated by the phosphatases was not sufficient to support TRPV1 function. We conclude that PI(4,5)P(2), and not other phosphoinositides or other lipids, is the endogenous phosphoinositide regulating TRPV1 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2164036826,"The p53 tumour suppressor is involved in several crucial cellular functions including cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. p53 stabilization occurs under hypoxic and DNA damage conditions. However, only in the latter scenario is stabilized p53 capable of inducing the expression of its pro-apoptotic targets. Here we present evidence that under hypoxia-mimicking conditions p53 acetylation is reduced to a greater extent at K320 site targeted by P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) than at K382 site targeted by p300/CBP. The limited amounts of acetylated p53 at K320 are preferentially recruited to the promoter of the p21WAF-1/CIP-1 gene, which appears to be unaffected by hypoxia, but are not recruited to the BID promoter and hence p53 is incapable of upregulating pro-apoptotic BID in hypoxic conditions. As the K320 p53 acetylation is the site predominantly affected in hypoxia, the PCAF histone acetyltransferase activity is the key regulator of the cellular fate modulated by p53 under these conditions. In addition, we provide evidence that PCAF acetylates hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in hypoxic conditions and that the acetylated HIF-1α is recruited to a particular subset of its targets. In conclusion, PCAF regulates the balance between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in hypoxia by modulating the activity and protein stability of both p53 and HIF-1α."
https://openalex.org/W2150693815,"Background The transcription factor B-Myb is present in all proliferating cells, and in mice engineered to remove this gene, embryos die in utero just after implantation due to inner cell mass defects. This lethal phenotype has generally been attributed to a proliferation defect in the cell cycle phase of G1. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we show that the major cell cycle defect in murine embryonic stem (mES) cells occurs in G2/M. Specifically, knockdown of B-Myb by short-hairpin RNAs results in delayed transit through G2/M, severe mitotic spindle and centrosome defects, and in polyploidy. Moreover, many euploid mES cells that are transiently deficient in B-Myb become aneuploid and can no longer be considered viable. Knockdown of B-Myb in mES cells also decreases Oct4 RNA and protein abundance, while over-expression of B-MYB modestly up-regulates pou5f1 gene expression. The coordinated changes in B-Myb and Oct4 expression are due, at least partly, to the ability of B-Myb to directly modulate pou5f1 gene promoter activity in vitro. Ultimately, the loss of B-Myb and associated loss of Oct4 lead to an increase in early markers of differentiation prior to the activation of caspase-mediated programmed cell death. Conclusions/Significance Appropriate B-Myb expression is critical to the maintenance of chromosomally stable and pluripotent ES cells, but its absence promotes chromosomal instability that results in either aneuploidy or differentiation-associated cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1989321356,"Background Therapeutic intervention in many neurological diseases is thwarted by the physical obstacle formed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that excludes most drugs from entering the brain from the blood. Thus, identifying efficacious modes of drug delivery to the brain remains a “holy grail” in molecular medicine and nanobiotechnology. Brain capillaries, that comprise the BBB, possess an endogenous receptor that ferries an iron-transport protein, termed p97 (melanotransferrin), across the BBB. Here, we explored the hypothesis that therapeutic drugs “piggybacked” as conjugates of p97 can be shuttled across the BBB for treatment of otherwise inoperable brain tumors. Approach Human p97 was covalently linked with the chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel (PTAX) or adriamycin (ADR) and following intravenous injection, measured their penetration into brain tissue and other organs using radiolabeled and fluorescent derivatives of the drugs. In order to establish efficacy of the conjugates, we used nude mouse models to assess p97-drug conjugate activity towards glioma and mammary tumors growing subcutaneously compared to those growing intracranially. Principal Findings Bolus-injected p97-drug conjugates and unconjugated p97 traversed brain capillary endothelium within a few minutes and accumulated to 1–2% of the injected by 24 hours. Brain delivery with p97-drug conjugates was quantitatively 10 fold higher than with free drug controls. Furthermore, both free-ADR and p97-ADR conjugates equally inhibited the subcutaneous growth of gliomas growing outside the brain. Evocatively, only p97-ADR conjugates significantly prolonged the survival of animals bearing intracranial gliomas or mammary tumors when compared to similar cumulated doses of free-ADR. Significance This study provides the initial proof of concept for p97 as a carrier capable of shuttling therapeutic levels of drugs from the blood to the brain for the treatment of neurological disorders, including classes of resident and metastatic brain tumors. It may be prudent, therefore, to consider implementation of this novel delivery platform in various clinical settings for therapeutic intervention in acute and chronic neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2106597654,"Background PepT1, an intestinal epithelial apical di/tripeptide transporter, is normally expressed in the small intestine and induced in colon during chronic inflammation. This study aimed at investigating PepT1 regulation by butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by commensal bacteria and accumulated inside inflamed colonocyte. Results We found that butyrate treatment of human intestinal epithelial Caco2-BBE cells increased human PepT1 (hPepT1) promoter activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with maximal activity observed in cells treated with 5 mM butyrate for 24 h. Under this condition, hPepT1 promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression levels were increased as assessed by luciferase assay, real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. hPepT1 transport activity was accordingly increased by ∼2.5-fold. Butyrate did not alter hPepT1 mRNA half-life indicating that butyrate acts at the transcriptional level. Molecular analyses revealed that Cdx2 is the most important transcription factor for butyrate-induced increase of hPepT1 expression and activity in Caco2-BBE cells. Butyrate-activated Cdx2 binding to hPepT1 promoter was confirmed by gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Moreover, Caco2-BBE cells overexpressing Cdx2 exhibited greater hPepT1 expression level than wild-type cells. Finally, treatment of mice with 5 mM butyrate added to drinking water for 24 h increased colonic PepT1 mRNA and protein expression levels, as well as enhanced PepT1 transport activity in colonic apical membranes vesicles. Conclusions Collectively, our results demonstrate that butyrate increases PepT1 expression and activity in colonic epithelial cells, which provides a new understanding of PepT1 regulation during chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2147122298,"Mutations in PfCRT (Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistant transporter), particularly the substitution at amino acid position 76, confer chloroquine (CQ) resistance in P. falciparum. Point mutations in the homolog of the mammalian multidrug resistance gene (pfmdr1) can also modulate the levels of CQ response. Moreover, parasites with the same pfcrt and pfmdr1 alleles exhibit a wide range of drug sensitivity, suggesting that additional genes contribute to levels of CQ resistance (CQR). Reemergence of CQ sensitive parasites after cessation of CQ use indicates that changes in PfCRT are deleterious to the parasite. Some CQR parasites, however, persist in the field and grow well in culture, which may reflect adaptive changes in the parasite genome to compensate for the mutations in PfCRT. Using three isogenic clones that have different drug resistance profiles corresponding to unique mutations in the pfcrt gene (106/1K76, 106/176I, and 106/76I-352K), we investigated changes in gene expression in these parasites grown with and without CQ. We also conducted hybridizations of genomic DNA to identify copy number (CN) changes in parasite genes. RNA transcript levels from 45 genes were significantly altered in one or both mutants relative to the parent line, 106/1K76. Most of the up-regulated genes are involved in invasion, cell growth and development, signal transduction, and transport activities. Of particular interest are genes encoding proteins involved in transport and/or regulation of cytoplasmic or compartmental pH such as the V-type H+ pumping pyrophosphatase 2 (PfVP2), Ca2+/H+ antiporter VCX1, a putative drug transporter and CN changes in pfmdr1. These changes may represent adaptations to altered functionality of PfCRT, a predicted member of drug/metabolite transporter superfamily found on the parasite food vacuole (FV) membrane. Further investigation of these genes may shed light on how the parasite compensates for functional changes accompanying drug resistance mutations in a gene coding for a membrane/drug transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2061391357,"Background Despite wide recognition that children with disability often have poor oral health, few high quality, controlled results are available. Method Twenty-four objective and subjective criteria covering feeding, autonomy, access to dental care, oral hygiene, oral disease, general health and behavior were evaluated in a observational cross-sectional study of 2,487 children with disability (DC group), 4,772 adolescents with disability (DA group) and 1,641 children without disability (NDC group). Five algorithms ranked the subjects according to clinical criteria in three original oral health indices: the Clinical Oral Health Index (COHI), indicating the level of oral health problems, the Clinical Oral Care Needs Index (COCNI) giving dental care need levels, and the Clinical Oral Prevention Index (COPI) determining possible needs in terms of dental education initiatives. Results DC-group children presented poorer oral health and had greater needs in both treatment and preventive oral health actions than NDC-group children (OR = 3.97, 95% CI = 3.25–4.86 for COHI; OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.77–2.28 for COCNI; OR = 5.25, 95% CI = 4.55–6.02 for COPI). These conditions were worse again in the DA group comparing to the DC group (OR = 3.52, 95% CI = 2.7–4.6 for COHI; OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.38–1.69 for COCNI; OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.39–1.69 for COPI). Conclusion Clinical indices generated by algorithmic association of various clinical indicators allow sensitive clinical measurement, and in this study demonstrated inequalities in oral health for children with disabilities schooling in institutions. Questions need now to be addressed as to the measures that could be taken to compensate for this situation."
https://openalex.org/W1980747541,"The determination of left/right body axis during early embryogenesis sets up a developmental cascade that coordinates the development of the viscera and is essential to the correct placement and alignment of organ systems and vasculature. Defective left-right patterning can lead to congenital cardiac malformations, vascular anomalies and other serious health problems. Here we describe a novel role for the T-box transcription factor gene Tbx6 in left/right body axis determination in the mouse.Embryos lacking Tbx6 show randomized embryo turning and heart looping. Our results point to multiple mechanisms for this effect. First, Dll1, a direct target of Tbx6, is down regulated around the node in Tbx6 mutants and there is a subsequent decrease in nodal signaling, which is required for laterality determination. Secondly, in spite of a lack of expression of Tbx6 in the node, we document a profound effect of the Tbx6 mutation on the morphology and motility of nodal cilia. This results in the loss of asymmetric calcium signaling at the periphery of the node, suggesting that unidirectional nodal flow is disrupted. To carry out these studies, we devised a novel method for direct labeling and live imaging cilia in vivo using a genetically-encoded fluorescent protein fusion that labels tubulin, combined with laser point scanning confocal microscopy for direct visualization of cilia movement.We conclude that the transcription factor gene Tbx6 is essential for correct left/right axis determination in the mouse and acts through effects on notch signaling around the node as well as through an effect on the morphology and motility of the nodal cilia."
https://openalex.org/W2013843163,"Abstract The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, which likely plays a key role in Alzheimer disease, is derived from the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) through consecutive proteolytic cleavages by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme and γ-secretase. Unexpectedly γ-secretase inhibitors can increase the secretion of Aβ peptides under some circumstances. This “Aβ rise” phenomenon, the same inhibitor causing an increase in Aβ at low concentrations but inhibition at higher concentrations, has been widely observed. Here we show that the Aβ rise depends on the β-secretase-derived C-terminal fragment of APP (βCTF) or C99 levels with low levels causing rises. In contrast, the N-terminally truncated form of Aβ, known as “p3,” formed by α-secretase cleavage, did not exhibit a rise. In addition to the Aβ rise, low βCTF or C99 expression decreased γ-secretase inhibitor potency. This “potency shift” may be explained by the relatively high enzyme to substrate ratio under conditions of low substrate because increased concentrations of inhibitor would be necessary to affect substrate turnover. Consistent with this hypothesis, γ-secretase inhibitor radioligand occupancy studies showed that a high level of occupancy was correlated with inhibition of Aβ under conditions of low substrate expression. The Aβ rise was also observed in rat brain after dosing with the γ-secretase inhibitor BMS-299897. The Aβ rise and potency shift are therefore relevant factors in the development of γ-secretase inhibitors and can be evaluated using appropriate choices of animal and cell culture models. Hypothetical mechanisms for the Aβ rise, including the “incomplete processing” and endocytic models, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2068294480,"Patients with Doublecortin (DCX) mutations have severe cortical malformations associated with mental retardation and epilepsy. Dcx knockout (KO) mice show no major isocortical abnormalities, but have discrete hippocampal defects. We questioned the functional consequences of these defects and report here that Dcx KO mice are hyperactive and exhibit spontaneous convulsive seizures. Changes in neuropeptide Y and calbindin expression, consistent with seizure occurrence, were detected in a large proportion of KO animals, and convulsants, including kainate and pentylenetetrazole, also induced seizures more readily in KO mice. We show that the dysplastic CA3 region in KO hippocampal slices generates sharp wave-like activities and possesses a lower threshold for epileptiform events. Video-EEG monitoring also demonstrated that spontaneous seizures were initiated in the hippocampus. Similarly, seizures in human patients mutated for DCX can show a primary involvement of the temporal lobe. In conclusion, seizures in Dcx KO mice are likely to be due to abnormal synaptic transmission involving heterotopic cells in the hippocampus and these mice may therefore provide a useful model to further study how lamination defects underlie the genesis of epileptiform activities."

We investigated sHsp membrane function in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PPC 6803 using mutants of the single sHsp from this organism, Hsp17. We examined mutants in the N-terminal arm, L9P and Q16R, for altered interaction with thylakoid and lipid membranes and examined the effects of these mutations on thylakoid functions. These mutants are unusual in that they retain their oligomeric state and chaperone activity in vitro but fail to confer thermotolerance in vivo. We found that both mutant proteins had dramatically altered membrane/lipid interaction properties. Whereas L9P showed strongly reduced binding to thylakoid and model membranes, Q16R was almost exclusively membrane-associated, properties that may be the cause of reduced heat tolerance of cells carrying these mutations. Among the lipid classes tested, Q16R displayed the highest interaction with negatively charged SQDG. In Q16R cells a specific alteration of the thylakoid-embedded Photosystem II (PSII) complex was observed. Namely, the binding of plastoquinone and quinone analogue acceptors to the QB site was modified. In addition, the presence of Q16R dramatically reduced UV-B damage of PSII activity because of enhanced PSII repair. We suggest these effects occur at least partly because of increased interaction of Q16R with SQDG in the PSII complex. Our findings further support the model that membrane association is a functional property of sHsps and suggest sHsps as a possible biotechnological tool to enhance UV protection of photosynthetic organisms.

Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) 2The abbreviations used are:Hspheat shock proteinsHspsmall HspMGDGmonogalactosyl diacylglycerolSQDGsulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerolMGlcDGmonoglucosyl diacylglycerolPQplastoquinonePSIIphotosystem IIWTwild typeTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidDMBQ2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinoneDCBQ2,5-dichloro-p-benzoquinonepBQp-benzoquinone. are a ubiquitous family of ATP-independent chaperones defined by their conserved α-crystallin domain, which is flanked by an N-terminal arm of variable length and sequence and by a short C-terminal extension (1van Montfort R.L.M.

Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In their native state the majority of sHsps are found as large oligomers with 12 to greater than 32 subunits dependent on the sHsp (3Waters E.R. Lee G.J. Vierling E. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 325-338Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 4Stamler R. Kappe G. Boelens W. Slingsby C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). sHsps can capture unfolding proteins to form stable complexes and prevent their irreversible aggregation. The coaggregation of sHsps with aggregation-prone proteins facilitates subsequent efficient disaggregation (5Basha E. Lee G.J. Breci L.A. Hausrath A.C. Buan N.R. Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Besides acting as molecular chaperones, sHsps also exhibit widely documented membrane interactions in prokaryotes, plants, and mammalian systems (7Nakamoto H. Vigh L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), which can profoundly affect various membrane functions. Lipid-specific interactions of sHsps were shown not only to modulate the molecular order and polymorphism of the membrane lipid phase (8Török Z. Goloubinoff P. Horváth I. Tsvetkova N.M. Glatz A.

In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, a well characterized photosynthetic model organism, the single sHsp Hsp17 (also known as Hsp16.6), is essential for tolerance to high temperature (12Lee S. Owen H.A. Prochaska D.J. Barnum S.R. Curr. Microbiol. 2000; 40: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and its amount greatly increases during UV-B stress (13Huang L. McCluskey M.P. Ni H. LaRossa R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6845-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Consistent with the chaperone model of sHsp activity, Hsp17 interacts with a large number of heat-labile proteins in vivo and can prevent irreversible protein aggregation in vitro (5Basha E. Lee G.J. Breci L.A. Hausrath A.C. Buan N.R. Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7566-7575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, Synechocystis Hsp17 possesses not only protein-protective activity but also the ability to stabilize the lipid phase of membranes (9Tsvetkova N.M. Horváth I. Török Z. Wolkers W.F. Balogi Z. Shigapova N. Crowe L.M. Tablin F. Vierling E. Crowe J.H. Vigh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13504-13509Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and a portion of Hsp17 is typically found in the thylakoid-containing fraction of cell extracts. Thus, this sHsp appears to play an additional role in membrane quality control, potentially contributing to the maintenance of thylakoid integrity, especially under stress conditions (12Lee S. Owen H.A. Prochaska D.J. Barnum S.R. Curr. Microbiol. 2000; 40: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A link to membrane function is also reflected in the observation that transcription of the hsp17 gene is strongly regulated by subtle changes in the physical order of the membranes (14Horváth I. Glatz A. Varvasovszki V. Török Z. Páli T. Balogh G. Kovács E. Nádasdi L. Benkö S. Joó F. Vigh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3513-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Analysis of Synechocystis hsp17 deletion and wild type cells provided evidence that heat-induced membrane dynamical changes are causally related to the membrane lipid-Hsp17 interaction. The more heat-sensitive Synechocystis Δhsp17 strain displayed a significantly reduced stability of thylakoid electron transfer during heat stress in parallel with a strong increase in membrane fluidity as measured by 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) anisotropy (8Török Z. Goloubinoff P. Horváth I. Tsvetkova N.M. Glatz A. Balogh G. Varvasovszki V. Los D.A. Vierling E. Crowe J.H. Vigh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3098-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Differential scanning calorimetry studies revealed that in vitro Hsp17 strongly stabilizes the lamellar liquid-crystalline phase at the expense of the nonlamellar lipid phase (HII), which is known to disrupt membranes under severe heat or osmotic stress (9Tsvetkova N.M. Horváth I. Török Z. Wolkers W.F. Balogi Z. Shigapova N. Crowe L.M. Tablin F. Vierling E. Crowe J.H. Vigh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13504-13509Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Recently a novel “heat shock lipid,” the highly saturated MGlcDG, was identified as rapidly accumulating in Synechocystis cells exposed to combined heat and light stress (10Balogi Z. Török Z. Balogh G. Josvay K. Shigapova N. Vierling E. Vigh L. Horváth I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 436: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A preferential interaction of Hsp17 with this nonbilayer phase-forming MGlcDG together with MGDG is consistent with the hypothesis that optimization of the membrane physical state by thylakoid-associated sHsps is likely mediated via specific lipid-sHsp interactions. Additional evidence for the physiological relevance of thylakoid-associated Hsp17 was presented by Lee et al. (12Lee S. Owen H.A. Prochaska D.J. Barnum S.R. Curr. Microbiol. 2000; 40: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), who found that inactivation of hsp17 results in greatly reduced photosynthetic oxygen evolution in heat-stressed Synechocystis. Studies with Synechococcus PCC 7942 strain further demonstrated that constitutive expression of HspA, a sHsp from the thermophilic Synechococcus vulcanus, confers cellular thermotolerance and greatly increases the thermostability of both photosystem II (PSII) electron transport and light-harvesting phycocyanins (15Nakamoto H. Suzuki N. Roy S.K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is shown that UV-B radiation led to the induction of the heat shock response in Synechocystis. Heat shock regulon members whose mRNAs were elevated include dnaJ, dnaK, groEL, groES, clpB, htpG, and hspA. The htpA gene encoding Hsp17 was up-regulated ∼20-fold compared with ∼3-fold for the other chaperones (13Huang L. McCluskey M.P. Ni H. LaRossa R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6845-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because a subset of Hsp17 was shown to be thylakoid-associated (14Horváth I. Glatz A. Varvasovszki V. Török Z. Páli T. Balogh G. Kovács E. Nádasdi L. Benkö S. Joó F. Vigh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3513-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the possibility that it plays a more specific, unexplored function in UV-B stress. Besides DNA damage the main target site of UV-B radiation is the PSII complex of the photosynthetic apparatus, which is a thylakoid bound water-plastoquinone oxido-reductase. UV-B inactivates the catalytic site of the water-oxidizing complex in PSII and leads to the degradation of the D1 (and to a lesser extent of D2) subunit of the PSII reaction center (16Vass I. Handbook of Photosynthesis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 931-950Google Scholar). Restoration of PSII activity occurs via subsequent de novo synthesis of the UV-B damaged D1 (and D2) subunits (17Sass L. Spetea C. Máté Z. Nagy F. Vass I. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 55-62Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To define more precisely those features of Synechocystis Hsp17 that are essential for its in vivo function, the effects of Hsp17 mutations have been tested in systematic studies both in vivo and in vitro (18Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32674-32683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Giese K.C. Basha E. Catague B.Y. Vierling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18896-18901Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The majorities of mutations studied were in the conserved α-crystallin domain and were found to disrupt Hsp17 oligomerization and to reduce both in vitro chaperone activity and in vivo thermotolerance. However, interestingly, mutations in the N terminus (L9P and Q16R), a region known to play a role in sHsp oligomerization and proposed to be important for substrate binding, were found to exert only minor effects on the oligomeric state of Hsp17, with L9P oligomers being somewhat less stable and Q16R more stable than wild type. Most surprisingly, these mutants could be shown to act as chaperones in vitro in protection of firefly luciferase but did not support in vivo cellular thermotolerance equivalent to wild type (20Giese K.C. Basha E. Catague B.Y. Vierling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18896-18901Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the general chaperone action, as defined by in vitro biochemical assays, does not adequately explain the complete role of sHsps in vivo. In the present study we examined whether the two N-terminal mutations of Hsp17 altered the extent and/or mode of thylakoid and lipid association as well as thylakoid function during stress. Interestingly, the mutant L9P protein showed reduced association with thylakoid and lipid membranes, whereas the Q16R mutant protein was almost exclusively associated with the thylakoid and liposome fraction. Cells carrying Q16R showed specific effects of Hsp17 with the PSII complex impacting PQ binding to the QB site and reducing the extent of UV-B damage. This effect is related to significant improvement of PSII repair and suggests a novel and specific function for thylakoid-associated sHsp. In addition, these results suggest a potential role for sHsps as biotechnological tools to enhance UV protection in photosynthetic organisms. Plasmids, Strains, and Culture Conditions—Synechocystis 6803 hsp17 and its mutants were subcloned into the HpaI and ApaI sites of the plasmid pNaive containing a spectinomycin resistance marker for transformation into Synechocystis. For expression in Escherichia coli, the genes were inserted into the same sites in pJC20/Hpa, a modified version of pJC20 described previously (18Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Pools of pNaive containing mutated hsp17 were isolated from E. coli and transformed into the Synechocystis strain HK-1/ΔClpB1, which is null for both hsp17 and clpB1 (18Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in an illuminated 30 °C incubator on BG-11 agar plates, buffered with 10 mm TES, pH 8.2, supplemented with 5 mm glucose, 50 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml spectinomycin dihydrochloride, and 100 μg/ml erythromycin sulfate, as appropriate (18Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Suspension cultures were grown photoautotrophically (35 μE/m2/s) in BG-11, buffered with 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, supplemented with 5 mm glucose. The cells in exponential growth phase (A800 = 1.5 ± 0.3) were used in the experiments. In all of the experiments, the cells were treated at 42 °C for 3 h to induce Hsp production. Lipid Binding Assay—Large unilamellar vesicles were made of total polar lipids isolated from cells grown at 30 °C and then treated at 42 °C for 3 h by the extrusion method using polycarbonate filters of 200-nm pore size. Liposomes and purified proteins at a final concentration of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively, were incubated in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 20 mm sodium chloride for 1 h at room temperature. The protein-lipid mixture was pelleted at 60,000 rpm (Beckman, TLA-100.3) and separated to lipid-bound and supernatant fractions. Soluble samples were concentrated by acetone precipitation, and then both fractions were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. After boiling, equal portions of soluble and lipid-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and revealed by Coomassie staining. Radioactively labeled lipids were prepared by metabolic incorporation of [14C]carbonate into fatty acid backbones. Briefly, 100 ml of cells were grown on 3.4 mm sodium [14C]bicarbonate (0.9 mCi), yielding a total polar lipid mixture with a specific activity of 0.4 mCi/mg. Lipid binding experiments were repeated with liposomes made of 14C-labeled lipids as described above. The radioactive lipid content of protein samples separated by SDS-PAGE was detected by fluorography (21Skinner M.K. Griswold M. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and by liquid scintillation counting. Monolayer Experiments—Interaction of sHsps with monomolecular lipid layers was measured using a KSV3000 Langmuir Blodget instrument (KSV Instruments, Helsinki). Briefly, isolated lipids dissolved in chloroform at 0.4 mg/ml concentration were directly spread onto the surface of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 20 mm sodium chloride buffer at room temperature. Initial surface pressure of the lipid layer was adjusted to 22.0 ± 0.1 mN/m at a constant surface area. The sHsp of interest was injected underneath the monolayer, and subsequent changes in surface pressure, which are proportional to the strength of the interaction, were monitored. The extent of interaction was determined by calculating the maximal changes in surface pressure caused by the insertion of the actual sHsps as indicated. Kinetics of protein-lipid interaction was followed by monitoring the equilibration of 4.2 μg/ml sHsp with the monomolecular lipid layer (22Torok Z. Horvath I. Goloubinoff P. Kovacs E. Glatz A. Balogh G. Vigh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). UV-B Treatment—Heat-treated Synechocystis cells were exposed to UV-B radiation in open, rectangular glass containers, in which 100 ml of culture formed a 1-cm-deep layer. The containers were immersed into a temperature-controlled incubator to keep the suspension at 30 °C during the treatment. The cells, at a chlorophyll concentration of 6.5 μg of Chla/ml, were maintained in suspension by magnetic stirring. UV-B light was provided by a Vilbert-Lourmat VL-215 M lamp in combination with a 0.1-mm cellulose acetate filter (Clarfoil; Courtaluds Chemicals). The UV intensity at the surface of the cell suspension was 4.5 W/m2, which corresponds to 12 μmol/m2 s photon flux density at 312 nm. During recovery, the cells were illuminated by 40–50 μmol/m2 s visible light by an array of halogen spot lamps. Oxygen Evolution Measurements—Steady state rates of oxygen evolution were measured using a Hansatech DW2 O2 electrode at a light intensity of 1000 μmol·m–2·s–1 of photosynthetically active radiation (400–700 nm) in the presence of 0.5 mm DMBQ. For some measurements DCBQ or pBQ was also used as electron acceptors. Usually, 1 ml of heat-treated cells at 6.5 μg of Chla/ml were used in each measurement. The results are expressed as percentages of the oxygen evolution rate measured at time 0. Flash Fluorescence Measurements—Flash-induced increase and the subsequent decay of chlorophyll fluorescence yield were measured by a double-modulation fluorometer (PSI Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic) in the 150 μs to 100 s time ranges. Heat-treated samples were dark adapted for 3 min, and measurements were performed as described earlier (23Vass I. Kirilovsky D. Etienne A.-L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12786-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Multicomponent deconvolution of the curves was done using a fitting function with three components: two exponentials and one hyperbolic as described earlier (23Vass I. Kirilovsky D. Etienne A.-L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12786-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar): F(t) – F0 = A1 exp(–t/T1) + A2 exp(–t/T2) + A3/(1 + t/T3), where F(t) is the variable fluorescence yield, F0 is the basic fluorescence level before the flash, A1–A3 are the amplitudes, and T1–T3 are the time constants. The nonlinear correlation between the fluorescence yield and the redox state of QA was corrected by using the Joliot model with a value of 0.5 for the energy transfer parameter between PSII subunits (24Joliot A. Joliot P. C. R. Acad. Sci. 1964; 258: 4622-4625Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation and Immunoblotting—A thylakoid membrane fraction was prepared by breakage of heat-treated cells with glass beads (150–200 μm in diameter) at 4 °C followed by differential centrifugation according to Ref. 25Komenda J. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9625-9631Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar. Soluble fractions were concentrated by acetone precipitation and used as cytosolic samples. Protein composition was assessed by electrophoresis in a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel. For D1 immunoblotting the thylakoid membrane fraction was solubilized in Tris/HCl buffer as in Ref. 26Allahverdiyeva Y. Deak Zs. Szilárd A. Diner B.A. Nixon P.J. Vass I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3523-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, adjusted at 0.2 μg of Chla/lane and separated overnight at 18 °C. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schuell), and the membrane was probed with a global PsbA antibody (chicken anti PsbA). The secondary antibody was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-chicken IgY. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by colorimetric reaction using a BCIP-NBT system. The linearity of the immunoresponse was verified by loading a dilution series of samples. Protein levels were quantified using the National Institutes of Health program ImageJ. sHsp content of thylakoid and soluble fractions were determined by immunoblotting. Protein loads of 20 μg were separated by gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon™-P membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride, 0.45 μm; Millipore). Antigens were revealed by anti-Hsp16.6 rabbit antiserum, created against purified recombinant Hsp16.6 (i.e. Hsp17) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma), and then visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Other Methods—Lipids were isolated from heat-treated Synechocystis and analyzed as described earlier (27Vigh L. Los D.A. Horvath I. Murata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9090-9094Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared as detailed previously (9Tsvetkova N.M. Horváth I. Török Z. Wolkers W.F. Balogi Z. Shigapova N. Crowe L.M. Tablin F. Vierling E. Crowe J.H. Vigh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13504-13509Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The concentration of WT and mutant proteins was assayed by the microBCA method. Mutations Affecting Membrane Association of Hsp17—It has been shown that point mutations in Synechocystis Hsp17 can affect the physical properties as well as in vitro and in vivo chaperone activity of these sHsps (5Basha E. Lee G.J. Breci L.A. Hausrath A.C. Buan N.R. Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7566-7575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Giese K.C. Basha E. Catague B.Y. Vierling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18896-18901Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two mutations, both of which are located in the N-terminal arm of Hsp17 (L9P and Q16R), influenced neither the oligomeric state nor the in vitro chaperone activity of Hsp17, although they impaired heat tolerance in vivo. Because in vivo malfunctioning of L9P and Q16R mutants could not be interpreted on the basis of the current chaperone activity models, we investigated whether the mutated proteins have altered cellular localization that could lead to loss of thermotolerance. Exponentially growing Synechocystis cells were heat-treated for 3 h at 42 °C in the light to allow Hsp17 to accumulate and then thylakoid and cytosolic fractions were isolated. Immunoblot analysis revealed (Fig. 1) that WT Hsp17 is equally distributed between thylakoid and cytosolic fractions. In contrast, the L9P protein appears primarily in the soluble, whereas the Q16R mutant is found exclusively in thylakoid membrane fraction. These results clearly demonstrate that the N-terminal point mutations of Hsp17 protein, although they do not modify the overall oligomerization state, result in altered cellular localization compared with WT. We have attempted to learn whether the Q16R mutant protein is permanently associated with any of the photosynthetic complexes. To this end thylakoids isolated from the cells were solubilized with 0.5% β-dodecyl maltoside, and protein complexes were separated by blue native PAGE. Lanes were cut from the blue native gel and migrated into a second dimension SDS gel. After blotting, specific antibodies were used to identify D1 and Hsp17 proteins. We found that Hsp17 did not migrate together with the proteins of PSII or any other complexes (data not shown), but it behaved rather as a “free” protein. Thus, although the Q16R-Hsp17 protein is found on thylakoid membrane, its association to any photosystem complex, as predictable from results presented in this paper, is not “strong enough” to withstand separation on the gel system. Interaction of Mutant Hsp17 Proteins with Lipid Membranes—According to our previous studies, thylakoid association of Hsp17 may be established via its interaction with membrane lipids (8Török Z.

Liposomes made of total polar lipids isolated from Synechocystis cells grown at 30 °C and heat shocked at 42 °C for 3 h were incubated with purified recombinant proteins and then fractionated to soluble and liposome-associated, pellet fractions. Equal portions of soluble and sedimented samples were solubilized under reducing conditions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 2). Tested at a protein to lipid mass ratio of 1–2, both the WT and Q16R mutant Hsp17 were associated completely with the liposomes, whereas the L9P protein was almost exclusively localized to the soluble fraction (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, despite solubilization of the lipid-bound sHsps under harsh reducing conditions, some portion of Hsp17 displayed a lower mobility on the gel, migrating at a position corresponding to the molecular mass of an Hsp17 dimer (∼30 kDa). Purified recombinant Hsp17 proteins showed no protein band in the corresponding region as visible by Coomassie staining (Fig. 2, A and B). The appearance of this ∼30-kDa form could result from the presence and/or consequence of lipids bound to Hsp17 proteins. Although this band was observed for all three proteins incubated with liposomes, it was especially prominent in samples with the Q16R mutant. To test whether the dimerization, especially in the case of Q16R mutant, was initiated by lipids associated with the dimer form or whether the liposome treatment resulted in change of protein structure without lipid binding, we repeated the binding experiment using a radioactively 14C-labeled Synechocystis lipid mixture. The gel was exposed to fluorography to visualize any radioactive lipids bound to Q16R protein. As Fig. 2C shows, a radioactive band is detected at the ∼30-kDa regions that can originate only from the dimer bound lipids. Radioactivity of the excised ∼30-kDa band was confirmed by liquid scintillation counting compared with an inactive gel region of similar size, yielding activities of 189.0 ± 25.7 and 63.6 ± 5.1 dpm, respectively. It is known that lipids unusually resistant to harsh solubilization of the m"

Such increases and decreases of slow wave activity are limited to the cortical regions involved in specific task performance during wakefulness. Here, we test the hypothesis that reorganization of motor cortex produced by long-term potentiation (LTP) affects EEG activity of this brain area during subsequent sleep.By pairing median nerve stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralateral motor cortex, one can potentiate the motor output, which is presumed to reflect plasticity of the neural circuitry. This paired associative stimulation increases M1 cortical excitability at interstimulus intervals of 25 ms. We compared the scalp distribution of sleep EEG power following paired associative stimulation at 25 ms to that following a control paradigm with 50 ms intervals. It is shown that the experimental manipulation by paired associative stimulation at 25 ms induces a 48% increase in amplitude of motor evoked potentials. This LTP-like potentiation, induced during waking, affects delta and theta EEG power in both REM and non-REM sleep, measured during the following night. Slow-wave activity increases in some frontal and prefrontal derivations and decreases at sites neighboring and contralateral to the stimulated motor cortex. The magnitude of increased amplitudes of motor evoked potentials by the paired associative stimulation at 25 ms predicts enhancements of slow-wave activity in prefrontal regions.An LTP-like paradigm, presumably inducing increased synaptic strength, leads to changes in local sleep regulation, as indexed by EEG slow-wave activity. Enhancement and depression of slow-wave activity are interpreted in terms of a simultaneous activation of both excitatory and inhibitory circuits consequent to the paired associative stimulation at 25 ms."

https://openalex.org/W2122521083,"The Background Ribonuclease L (RNASEL), encoding the 2′-5′-oligoadenylate (2-5A)-dependent RNase L, is a key enzyme in the interferon induced antiviral and anti-proliferate pathway. Mutations in RNASEL segregate with the disease in prostate cancer families and specific genotypes are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) is the major risk factor for uterine cervix cancer and for a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). HPV, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and sequences from mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) have been detected in breast tumors, and the presence of integrated SV40 T/t antigen in breast carcinomas correlates with an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. A genetic predisposition could explain why some viral infections persist and induce cancer, while others disappear spontaneously. This points at RNASEL as a strong susceptibility gene. Methodology/Principal Findings To evaluate the implication of an abnormal activity of RNase L in the onset and development of viral induced cancers, the study was initiated by searching for germline mutations in patients diagnosed with uterine cervix cancer. The rationale behind is that close to 100% of the cervix cancer patients have a persistent HPV infection, and if a defective RNase L were responsible for the lack of ability to clear the HPV infection, we would expect to find a wide spectrum of mutations in these patients, leading to a decreased RNase L activity. The HPV genotype was established in tumor DNA from 42 patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the uterine cervix and somatic tissue from these patients was analyzed for mutations by direct sequencing of all coding and regulatory regions of RNASEL. Fifteen mutations, including still uncharacterized, were identified. The genotype frequencies of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) established in the cervix cancer patients were compared between 382 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), 199 patients with primary unilateral breast cancer and 502 healthy Danish control individuals. We found that the genotype frequencies of only one of the 15 mutations, the yet uncharacterized 5′UTR mutation rs3738579 differed significantly between cancer patients and control individuals (P-value: 4.43×10−5). Conclusion/Significance In conclusion, we have discovered an increased risk, a heterozygous advantage and thereby a protective effect linked to the RNASEL SNP rs3738579. This effect is found for patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the uterine cervix, HNSCC, and breast cancer thus pointing at RNASEL as a general marker for cancer risk and not restricted to familial prostate cancer."

The polymer is first produced as polymannuronic acid and the guluronic acid residues are then introduced at the polymer level by mannuronan C-5-epimerases. The structure of the catalytic A-module of the Azotobacter vinelandii mannuronan C-5-epimerase AlgE4 has been determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.1-A resolution. AlgE4A folds into a right-handed parallel beta-helix structure originally found in pectate lyase C and subsequently in several polysaccharide lyases and hydrolases. The beta-helix is composed of four parallel beta-sheets, comprising 12 complete turns, and has an amphipathic alpha-helix near the N terminus. The catalytic site is positioned in a positively charged cleft formed by loops extending from the surface encompassing Asp(152), an amino acid previously shown to be important for the reaction. Site-directed mutagenesis further implicates Tyr(149), His(154), and Asp(178) as being essential for activity. Tyr(149) probably acts as the proton acceptor, whereas His(154) is the proton donor in the epimerization reaction."

In contrast, astrocytes can affect disease by modulating the nervous system's microenvironment. Interestingly, little is known how astrocytes communicate with MP to influence disease.MP-astrocyte crosstalk was investigated by a proteomic platform analysis using vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped HIV infected murine microglia. The microglial-astrocyte dialogue was significant and affected microglial cytoskeleton by modulation of cell death and migratory pathways. These were mediated, in part, through F-actin polymerization and filament formation. Astrocyte secretions attenuated HIV-1 infected microglia neurotoxicity and viral growth linked to the regulation of reactive oxygen species.These observations provide unique insights into glial crosstalk during disease by supporting astrocyte-mediated regulation of microglial function and its influence on the onset and progression of neuroAIDS. The results open new insights into previously undisclosed pathogenic mechanisms and open the potential for biomarker discovery and therapeutics that may influence the course of HIV-1-mediated neurodegeneration."

Whether similar lateralization of function for communicative signal production is present in other primates remains a topic of considerable debate. In the current study, we examined whether oro-facial movements associated with the production of learned attention-getting sounds are differentially lateralized compared to facial expressions associated with the production of species-typical emotional vocalizations in chimpanzees.Still images captured from digital video were used to quantify oro-facial asymmetries in the production of two attention-getting sounds and two species-typical vocalizations in a sample of captive chimpanzees. Comparisons of mouth asymmetries during production of these sounds revealed significant rightward biased asymmetries for the attention-getting sounds and significant leftward biased asymmetries for the species-typical sounds.These results suggest that the motor control of oro-facial movements associated with the production of learned sounds is lateralized to the left hemisphere in chimpanzees. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the antecedents for lateralization of human speech may have been present in the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans approximately 5 mya and are not unique to the human lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1979061052,"Uptake of low density lipoproteins (LDL) by their receptor, LDLR, is the primary mechanism by which cells incorporate cholesterol from plasma. Mutations in LDLR lead to familial hypercholesterolemia, a common disease affecting 1 in 500 of the human population. LDLR is a modular protein that uses several small repeats to bind LDL. The repeats contain around 40 residues, including three disulfide bonds and a calcium ion. Repeat 5 (LR5) is critical for LDL and β-migrating very low density lipoprotein binding. Based on the crystal structure of LDLR at endosomal pH (but close to extracellular calcium concentration), LR5 has been proposed to bind to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor domain of LDLR in the endosome, thus releasing the LDL particles previously bound in extracellular conditions. We report here the conformational stability of LR5 as a function of temperature and calcium concentration under both extracellular and endosomal pH conditions. The repeat was very stable when it bore a bound calcium ion but was severely destabilized in the absence of calcium and even further destabilized at acidic versus neutral pH. The temperature and calcium concentration dependence of LR5 stability clearly indicate that under endosomal conditions the unfolded conformation of the repeat is largely dominant. We thus propose a new mechanism for LDL release in the endosome in which calcium depletion and decreased stability at acidic pH drives LR5 unfolding, which triggers LDL release from the receptor.

A β-hairpin at the N terminus is the only element of secondary structure in LR5, which additionally contains a small hydrophobic core formed by one isoleucine and one phenylalanine residue. The isolated LR5 repeat exhibiting the correct disulfide pattern is stable in the presence of Ca2+ (33Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but when the Ca2+ ion is removed, it adopts a non-native apoLR5 conformation (33Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The structural and functional importance of the Ca2+ ion is further stressed by the fact that recombinant LR5 cannot form native disulfide bonds in the absence of Ca2+ (33Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and that LDL binding is impaired at low Ca2+ concentrations (34Schneider W.J. Basu S.K. McPhaul M.J. Goldstein J.L.

Many mutations of the LDLR gene have been described that lead to FH, an autosomal, dominant disease (35Dedoussis G.V. Schmidt H. Genschel J. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 24: 443-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although FH homozygotes are very unusual and die at an early age, FH heterozygotes abound, representing 0.2% of the human population (36Goldstein J.L. Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Scrivor C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York2001: 2863-2913Google Scholar). It is well established that many LDLR mutations observed in patients with FH cause a local unfolding of the receptor, which compromises its correct functioning (3Anderson R.G. Goldstein J.L.

Understanding LDLR function at the molecular level may help fight FH.LDL release is essential for receptor recycling; a release mechanism has been proposed that is based on the x-ray structure of the receptor at endosomal pH (29Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). According to this mechanism, the EGF precursor domain of LDLR becomes, at acidic endosomal pH, a better ligand of the N-terminal binding domain than LDL, thus enforcing the release of the lipoprotein particle from the receptor (24Beglova N. Jeon H. Fisher C. Blacklow S.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 298: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). It is, however, unclear at present whether the EGF precursor domain participates actively in the mechanism of LDL release or rather sequesters the N-terminal binding domain once LDL is released from the receptor. It should be mentioned that, despite the wealth of structural and functional information available on LR5 (20Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 31North C.L. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13127-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32North C.L.

Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the conformational stability of this repeat has not yet been quantitated. There are good reasons for doing so because, protein stability being generally low, protein function is quite sensitive to point mutations, pH or temperature modifications, or ligand concentration. In this respect, the changes in pH and Ca2+ concentration experienced by the endosome relative to the initial extracellular conditions that allow LDL binding to LDLR could significantly modify the stability of LR5 or of other binding repeats in the receptor so as to influence LDL release by simply reducing the stability of the LDL·LDLR complex.We have recently reported the oxidative folding pathway of LR5 (39Arias-Moreno X. Arolas J.L. Aviles F.X. Sancho J. Ventura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13627-13637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using a combination of calorimetric and spectroscopic techniques, we report here the conformational stability of LR5 as a function of Ca2+ concentration and temperature at both extracellular and endosomal pH, which sheds light on the mechanisms involved in receptor recycling. The stability phase diagrams of LR5 in endosomal and extracellular conditions indicate that the lower stability of LR5 at low pH and low Ca2+ concentrations triggers its unfolding in the endosome, thus providing a mechanism for LDL release from the receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Expression—The plasmid pLDLR2, containing the full-length cDNA of LDLR was used as template to PCR-amplify the fragment corresponding to LR5, using the Expand high fidelity PCR Kit (Roche Applied Science) and to clone it into a pGEM-T plasmid (Promega). The following primers, which introduce flanking XhoI and BamHI restriction sites, were used: 5′-GTGGATCCAAGCCCCTGCTCGGCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTCAAGCGCAGTTTTCCTCGTC-3′. After cloning, the sequence of LR5 was confirmed, and the fragment was cloned into the expression vector pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) from which LR5 can be expressed as a protein fused with glutathione-sulfhydryl transferase from Schistosoma japonicum. To that end, the purified pGEX-4T-3 plasmid, containing the LR5 sequence, was introduced into competent Escherichia coli BL21 cells, and transformed colonies were selected in agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Typically, 11-liter cultures in LB medium were prepared in Erlenmeyer flasks, and 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was used to induce expression of the fusion protein.LR5 Purification—E. coli BL21 cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 and sonicated. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto an affinity column (GSTPrep FF16/10, Amersham Biosciences) from which the fusion protein was purified with high yield. To release LR5, the fusion protein was cleaved with bovine thrombin from Sigma (10 units of thrombin/mg of GSTLR5). The N-terminal residue of the LR5 thus released is glycine instead of the wild-type aspartate. After cleavage, LR5 was refolded under conditions permitting disulfide exchange by exhaustive dialysis at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, containing 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm cysteine, and 0.5 mm cystine. LR5 was finally purified by RP-HPLC on a C18 preparative column (Symmetry columns) using a 0–100% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% aqueous orthophosphoric acid. Protein elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm, and the purity of the repeat was determined by electrophoresis (PhastGel System, GE Healthcare) with silver staining (Amersham Biosciences). A single, strong band corresponding to LR5 was obtained, indicating that the repeat was pure (99%). MALDI-TOF MS using a Bruker Ultraflex confirmed the purity of the isolated protein. To determine the uniqueness of the disulfide pattern, analytical RP-HPLC on a C18 column (Vydac) was performed using a 15–35% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% aqueous orthophosphoric acid. Under these conditions a single peak was obtained, which was verified by MALDI-TOF MS (39Arias-Moreno X. Arolas J.L. Aviles F.X. Sancho J. Ventura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13627-13637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to contain three disulfide bridges. The concentration of LR5 was determined using the theoretical extinction coefficient (40Wilkins M.R. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Williams K.L. Appel R.D. Hochstrasser D.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 531-552PubMed Google Scholar) ϵ280 = 6050 m-1cm-1.Spectroscopic Characterization of LR5 under a Variety of Solution Conditions—Fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectra were acquired to search for spectroscopic differences between the folded, thermally unfolded (80 °C), and GdnSCN (3 m) unfolded apoLR5 in the presence and absence of calcium. To mimic extracellular conditions, a 10 mm PIPES buffer with 150 mm NaCl was used, and for endosomal conditions, 10 mm MES, pH 5.5, with 150 mm NaCl was used. Typically, apoLR5 was obtained by adding 1.5 mm EDTA to the protein solution, and the calcium-bound form was obtained by adding 10 mm CaCl2.Fluorescence emission spectra (300–450 nm, with excitation at 280 nm) were acquired in a thermostated Aminco-Bowman series 2 spectrophotometer (Spectronic Instruments) using 2 μm LR5 samples. Far-UV CD spectra were acquired from 260 to 195 nm in a 1-mm-path length cuvette with 60 μm LR5, and near-UV CD spectra were recorded from 325 to 245 nm in a 40-mm-path length cuvette using 115 μm LR5. All CD spectra were recorded in a thermostated Chirascan (Applied Photophysics).GdnSCN Denaturation—Chemical denaturation curves of apoLR5 were obtained using GdnSCN (Fluka) as the denaturant, and these were followed by tryptophan fluorescence emission. Typically, 1.5 μm LR5 samples in 10 mm PIPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, plus different GdnSCN concentrations from 0 to 6 m were prepared, and their fluorescence was measured at 9.5, 15.5, and 25.0 °C. The unfolded curves were fitted to a two-state equation (Equation 1) (41Pace C.N. Laurents D.V. Thomson J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2564-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 42Genzor C.G. Beldarrain A. Gomez-Moreno C. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Sancho J.

In Equation 1, the free energy is given by ΔG=ΔGw-mD(Eq. 2) where ΔGw is the free energy of unfolding in the experimental buffer without denaturant.Thermal Denaturation Followed by Spectroscopic Characterization—Thermal denaturation curves of apoLR5 at pH 7.0 and 5.5 (in the buffers described above, with 1.5 mm EDTA) were followed by far-UV CD, near-UV CD, and tryptophan fluorescence emission. The curves were recorded from 5 to 90 °C at a scan rate of 1.5–2.0 °C/min. LR5 concentrations, wavelengths, and path lengths were 60 μm, 227.5 nm, and 1 mm (far-UV CD); 115 μm, 267.5 nm, and 0.4 cm (near-UV CD); and 2 μm, 350 nm (excitation at 280 nm), and 1 cm (fluorescence emission). Unfolding curves were fitted (43Makhatadze G.I. Kim K.S. Woodward C. Privalov P.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 44Campos L.A. Sancho J. Proteins. 2006; 63: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to a two-state equation (Equation 3), F=FN+mNT+(FD+mDT)e-ΔG/RT1+e-ΔG/RT(Eq. 3) where F is the spectroscopic signal, T is absolute temperature, and FN and FD refer, respectively, to the spectroscopic signals of native and denatured LR5 at a reference temperature (T0) and are assumed to vary linearly with temperature with slopes mN and mD.In Equation 3, ΔG, free energy of the unfolding, is given by ΔG=ΔH(1-T/Tm)+ΔCp(T-Tm-Tln(T/Tm))(Eq. 4) where Tm is the melting temperature, and ΔCp and ΔH are the heat capacity and enthalpy changes, respectively, at the melting temperature.Thermal Denaturation Followed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The heat capacity of LR5 was measured as a function of temperature at pH 7 and 5.5 in a differential scanning VP-DSC MicroCalorimeter (Microcal LLC, Northampton, MA). Protein samples and reference solutions were degassed and carefully loaded into the cells to avoid bubble formation. The base line of the instrument was routinely recorded with both cells filled with buffer before the experiments were performed. To reach the conditions of the experiments, LR5 samples were lyophilized, resuspended, and passed through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Thermal denaturation scans were performed with 400 μm protein solutions in either pH 7.0 or 5.5, with 150 mm EDTA or 1.5 mm CaCl2 when required. Experiments were carried out at a scanning rate of 1 °C/min from 10 to 100 °C. The reversibility of unfolding, as checked by sample reheating after cooling inside the calorimetric cell, was higher than 80%. LR5 denaturation in the absence of calcium was analyzed assuming a two-state transition model. The excess average unfolding enthalpy is given by 〈ΔH(T)〉=FU(T)ΔH(T)(Eq. 5) where ΔH(T) is the unfolding enthalpy at temperature T, and FU(T) is the fraction of unfolded protein molecules, which is governed by Equation 4. The temperature derivative of the excess average unfolding enthalpy equals the excess heat capacity, which is the direct observable when measured with the calorimeter.LR5 denaturation in the presence of calcium was analyzed assuming a two-state transition coupled to calcium dissociation. Total protein and ligand concentrations were [P]T=[N]+[U]+[NL]=(1+K)[N]+KL[N][L](Eq. 6) [L]T=[L]+[NL]=[N]+KL[N][L](Eq. 7) where [N], [NL], and [U] are the concentrations of free native, bound native, and unfolded protein, [L] is the concentration of free ligand, K is the unfolding equilibrium constant, and KL is the ligand binding equilibrium constant, which is temperature-dependent according to KL(T)=KL(T0)exp(-ΔHL(T0)RT(1-T/T0)-ΔCPLR(1-(T0/T)-ln(T/T0)))(Eq. 8) where KL(T0) and ΔHL(T0) are the binding constant and the binding enthalpy, respectively, at reference temperature T0 (usually 25 °C) and ΔCPL is the change in heat capacity upon binding. The concentration of any species at any temperature is calculated for any total concentration of protein and ligand from the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants for unfolding and binding, KL(T), by solving Equations 6 and 7.On the other hand, the excess average enthalpy in the presence of ligand is as follows (45Straume M. Freire E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), 〈ΔH(T)〉=FU(T)(ΔH(T)+FBΔHL(T))(Eq. 9) where FB is the fraction of protein molecules bound to ligand. The temperature derivative of the excess average enthalpy equals the excess heat capacity, which is the direct observable when measured with the calorimeter.Calcium Binding to LR5 Followed by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal calorimetry experiments (ITC) were performed in a VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (Microcal) in the presence of a slight excess of EDTA (46Nielsen A.D. Fuglsang C.C. Westh P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Purified LR5 solutions typically carry free calcium coming from impurities in the buffer solution. Complete removal of calcium from the protein solution using a Chelex resin was attempted, but it was not successful and led to protein aggregation. Therefore, titration experiments were performed in the presence of a chelator (EDTA) (46Nielsen A.D. Fuglsang C.C. Westh P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because the affinity of EDTA for calcium is higher than that of LR5, in a typical ITC experiment with excess EDTA, injected calcium binds first to EDTA, and once EDTA is saturated, titration of apoLR5 begins. As described (47Griko Y.V. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 79: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), calcium binding to EDTA is coupled to the release of one proton, and, consequently, the binding affinity is highly dependent on pH. In addition, the binding enthalpy is dependent on pH and on the buffer ionization enthalpy. A similar behavior was expected for the binding of calcium to LR5. Because the purpose here was to determine the calcium binding affinities at extracellular and endosomal pH values, the enthalpy values reported are the observed buffer-dependent enthalpies of binding under the conditions assayed, and determination of buffer-independent binding enthalpies will be left for future work.After degassing all solutions, the experiments were carried out with 15 μm LR5 in a 10 mm solution of the appropriate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and EDTA. The buffers used were: at pH 7, PIPES (ionization enthalpy: 2.74 kcal/mol); and at pH 5.5, sodium acetate (ionization enthalpy: 0.12 kcal/mol). To estimate the heat capacity change upon binding, experiments were carried out at different temperatures. To check the performance of the method, thermodynamic parameters for the binding of calcium to EDTA were determined under the same conditions. They were in agreement with data described previously (47Griko Y.V. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 79: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and were used in the analysis performed to determine the parameters for the binding of calcium to LR5. In titration experiments of LR5 in the presence of EDTA, two coupled binding equilibria were considered, M+L⇆ML(Eq. 10) Q+L⇆QL(Eq. 11) where M refers to the macromolecule (LR5), Q to the chelator (EDTA), and L to the ligand (calcium). From the mass balances of macromolecule, chelator and ligand, the total concentration of ligand can be written as [L]r=[L]+[M]TKM[L]1+KM[L]+[Q]TKQ[L]1+KQ[L](Eq. 12) where Km and KQ are the binding constants of ligand to the macromolecule and chelator, respectively. Km is the association constant KL from the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The last two terms in Equation 12 represent the concentration of ligand bound to the macromolecule and chelator, respectively. The equation can be solved numerically and allows the concentration of each complex to be calculated. Because the heat evolved per injection is proportional to the variation of [ML] and [QL] and the corresponding molar binding enthalpies, the observed heat effect, qi, associated with any injection (i) is given b"

Telomerase RNA subunits are phylogenetically highly divergent, and different strategies have evolved to demarcate the boundary of the template region. The recent identification of the gene encoding telomerase RNA in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (ter1+) has opened the door for structure-function analyses in a model that shares many features with the telomere maintenance machinery of higher eukaryotes. Here we describe a structural element in TER1 that defines the 5′ boundary of the template. Disruption of a predicted long range base pairing interaction between template-adjacent nucleotides and a sequence further upstream resulted in reverse transcription beyond the template region and caused telomere shortening. Normal telomere length was restored by combining complementary nucleotide substitutions in both elements, showing that base pairing, not a specific sequence, limits reverse transcription beyond the template. The template boundary described here resembles that of budding yeasts and some mammalian telomerases. However, unlike any previously characterized boundary element, part of the paired region overlaps with the template itself, thus necessitating disruption of these interactions during most reverse transcription cycles. We show that changes in the paired region directly affect the length of individual telomeric repeat units. Our data further illustrate that marginal alignment of the telomeric 3′ end with RNA sequences downstream of the template is responsible for primer slippage, causing incorporation of strings of guanosines at the start of a subset of repeats.

The reverse transcriptase telomerase replenishes terminal DNA sequences lost through incomplete DNA replication and nucleolytic degradation (1Collins K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Without functional telomerase, telomeres undergo progressive shortening with each cell division, a process that eventually limits the proliferative potential of affected cells. Mutations in human telomerase subunits cause dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a group of disorders characterized by insufficient renewal capacity of cells caused by shortening of telomeres (2Mitchell J.R.

Conversely, activation of telomerase is critical for continued proliferation of most cancer cells, making the enzyme a promising target for anti-cancer drugs. At its core, telomerase is comprised of the catalytic protein subunit TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) and a TER (telomerase RNA) component (7Cech T.R. Cell. 2004; 116: 273-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Together, TERT and TER are sufficient to reconstitute activity in vitro, but additional factors are required for telomere maintenance in vivo. Whereas TERT has a highly conserved catalytic domain, telomerase RNA subunits vary widely in size from ∼150 nucleotides in ciliates and ∼450 nucleotides in vertebrates to over 1,500 nucleotides in some yeasts (8Theimer C.A. Feigon J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Chen J.L. Greider C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Even among closely related species, substantial variation in telomerase RNA sequence exists. For example, the telomerase RNA subunits of four sensu stricto Saccharomyces species share only 43% sequence identity (10Zappulla D.C. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10024-10029Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Despite widely divergent primary sequences, conserved structural elements have been identified in ciliates (11Romero D.P.

Biol. 2004; 14: 1148-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and a universal RNA core has been proposed (15Lin J. Ly H. Hussain A. Abraham M. Pearl S. Tzfati Y. Parslow T.G. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whereas viral reverse transcriptases make DNA copies of large RNA molecules, telomerase repeatedly copies only a few nucleotides of its RNA subunit to generate telomeric repeats. In most eukaryotes, the template region consists of one and a half telomeric repeats. To ensure that only the template sequence is copied onto the ends of chromosomes, the boundaries must be precisely defined. This challenge has been met with surprisingly diverse solutions over the course of eukaryotic evolution. In ciliates, the conserved sequence motif 5′-(U)GUCA-3′ is located two nucleotides upstream of the template (12Lingner J. Hendrick L.L. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1984-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16McCormick-Graham M. Romero D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and defines the template boundary (17Autexier C. Greider C.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2227-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Closer examination revealed that the template boundary sequence overlaps with a high affinity binding site recognized by the RNA binding domain of TERT, suggesting that a TERT-RNA interaction blocks copying of the template past the boundary (18Lai C.K. Miller M.C. Collins K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In Kluyveromyces and Saccharomyces yeast species, nucleotides directly adjacent to the template are base-paired with complementary sequences several hundred nucleotides upstream. This bulged stem structure, rather than a specific sequence, determines the 5′ end of the template and prevents read-through into paired sequences (19Tzfati Y. Fulton T.B. Roy J. Blackburn E.H. Science. 2000; 288: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Seto A.G. Umansky K. Tzfati Y. Zaug A.J. Blackburn E.H. Cech T.R. RNA. 2003; 9: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the secondary structure of human telomerase, the template-proximal element of the P1 helix starts eight nucleotides upstream of the template. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the P1 helix and its distance from the template are critical for template boundary definition in human telomerase (21Chen J.L. Greider C.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2747-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The 5′ end of the RNA subunit in mouse is located only two nucleotides upstream of the template, and the distance to the end defines the template boundary (21Chen J.L. Greider C.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2747-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In all vertebrates, telomerase adds the hexameric repeat sequence GGTTAG, but substantial variability in repeat length and sequence is found in lower eukaryotes. For example, in Kluyveromyces and Candida yeast species, perfect copies of up to 26-nucleotide template sequences are repeatedly copied onto chromosome ends. In other fungi, some protozoa, and slime molds, shorter but heterogeneous repeats are found at chromosome ends (reviewed in Ref. 22Wellinger R.J. Sen D. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 735-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Multiple possible alignment registers (23Singer M.S. Gottschling D.E. Science. 1994; 266: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), slippage during repeat synthesis (24Collins K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 187-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and nucleotide misincorporation (25McCormick-Graham M. Haynes W.J. Romero D.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3233-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have all been found to account for the addition of variable repeat sequences from a single RNA template. Among well studied species, repeat heterogeneity is most prominent in the two evolutionarily distant fungi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Careful examination of telomeric sequences added by telomerase in S. cerevisiae revealed that heterogeneity arises through a combination of two mechanisms: abortive reverse transcription partway through the template and multiple alignment possibilities of the telomeric 3′ overhang with the RNA (26Forstemann K. Lingner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7277-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Early analysis of S. pombe telomeric sequences suggested a high degree of sequence heterogeneity with a consensus of T1-2ACA0-1C0-1 G1-6 or T1-3ACA0-2C0-1G1-8 (27Konig P. Rhodes D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Zakian V.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1601-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). It was later pointed out that this consensus included uncommon variations and that 5′-GGTTACA-3′ describes the majority of telomeric repeats (29Hiraoka Y. Henderson E. Blackburn E.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of a much larger sample of cloned telomeres revealed that S. pombe telomeres are comprised of constant GGTTAC core repeats separated by up to 10 nucleotides of spacer sequence (30Trujillo K.M. Bunch J.T. Baumann P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9119-9128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). How this unusual sequence pattern is generated has remained enigmatic largely because the gene encoding the telomerase RNA subunit in fission yeast was unknown until earlier this year (31Leonardi J. Box J.A. Bunch J.T. Baumann P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Webb C.J. Zakian V.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As expected for a telomerase core component, deletion of S. pombe ter1+ results in progressive telomere attrition, followed by widespread cell death and the emergence of survivors with circular chromosomes. A series of point mutations helped define which nucleotides in the RNA sequence are copied into telomeric repeats and thus constitute the template region (31Leonardi J. Box J.A. Bunch J.T. Baumann P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify the boundary element and to understand the mechanism underlying telomere repeat heterogeneity, we have now examined the sequence and structure adjacent to the template. We show that long range base pairing interactions create a boundary element that defines the 5′ end of the template. Surprisingly, the boundary element partially overlaps the template, and synthesis of most repeats found in natural telomere sequences involves partial opening of the paired region. Constructs and Strains—A knock-out for ter1+ was generated by replacing nucleotides 23-1422 of the RNA-encoding region with the kanamycin resistance gene in a diploid strain as described (33Baumann P. Cech T.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The resulting strain is referred to as PP407 (h+/- ade6-M210/ade6-M216 his3-D1/his3-D1 leu1-32/leu1-32 ura4-D18/ura4-D18 ter1+ ter1:kanr). Mutations in ter1 were introduced using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on pJW10, a plasmid containing a genomic DNA fragment of the ter1+ locus (31Leonardi J. Box J.A. Bunch J.T. Baumann P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). DNA constructs were sequence verified and introduced into PP407 by electroporation. Diploid transformants were selected on Edinburgh minimal media (EMM) supplemented with adenine, histidine, and leucine (EMM AHL) and sporulated on malt extract agar plates. Spores harboring a mutant ter1 plasmid were germinated on pombe minimal glutamate (PMG) supplemented with adenine, histidine, and leucine, and haploid strains deleted for the genomic copy of ter1+ were identified by growth on YEA geneticin. At least four isolates of each mutant were subjected to four serial restreaks on EMM AHL before cells were transferred into 20 ml of liquid EMM AHL for 18 h followed by genomic DNA isolation. Primer Extension—Total or poly(A) enriched RNA (5 μg) and RNA isolated from Trt1-Myc immunoprecipitations were incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide BLoli1116 (tatacttaaggcctatgaatc; 2 pmol) and dNTPs (10 nmol) in 13 μl of double distilled H2O at 65 °C for 5 min. The reaction volume was increased to 20 μl by the addition of RNase inhibitor (RNasin Plus, 40 units), dithiothreitol (final concentration, 5 mm), first strand buffer (Invitrogen), and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 units; Invitrogen), and reactions were incubated at 55 °C for 60 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of stop buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m EDTA, 2.5% (w/v) SDS, and 1% (w/v) proteinase K) and incubation at 42 °C for 10 min. Nucleic acids were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and solubilized in 3 μl of NaOH (0.1 m) and 7 μl of formamide. Radiolabeled primer extension products were separated on 8% Tris borate-EDTA, 8 m urea gels next to dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing reactions using cloned ter1+ as a template. Telomere Length and Capture Assay—Genomic DNA isolation and telomeric Southern blots were performed as described (34Bunch J.T. Bae N.S. Leonardi J. Baumann P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5567-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). S. pombe telomeres were cloned from genomic DNA samples using the G overhang capture assay (31Leonardi J. Box J.A. Bunch J.T. Baumann P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, a partial duplex (0.5 pmol) comprised of DNA oligonucleotides PBoli733 (gcgtacgactcactgtagatnnnnn-3′-O(CH2)2CH2OH) and PBoli749 (5′-phosphate-atctacagtgagtcgtacgcaa-3′ biotin) was incubated with 1 μg of S. pombe genomic DNA in a “Quick Ligation” reaction (New England Biolabs). Products were digested with EcoRI (40 units) for 3 h at 37 °C, and terminal DNA fragments ligated to the biotinylated tag were recovered on magnetic streptavidin beads (Dynal). After two washes in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m NaCl and two washes in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, chromosome end fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with PBoli434 (gtgtggaattgagtatggtga) and PBoli745 (gcgtacgactcactgtagat). PCR products were cloned into the pCR4blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) for sequence analysis of individual telomeres. Telomere Sequence Analysis—Telomeric sequences from each strain were compiled in FASTA format, and the relative abundance of different repeat sequences in each sample was determined using TweenMotif (30Trujillo K.M. Bunch J.T. Baumann P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9119-9128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Excel. The invariant sequence gggttacaaggttacgtggttacacggttaca found at the beginning of all telomeres was excluded from the analysis. Tween-Motif is an interactive Windows program for visualizing the locations of a specified target motif within a set of nucleotide sequences, as well as the gaps between the repeating motifs. The program creates a summary table of the frequency counts of the gap sequences that can be pasted into an Excel spread-sheet for further analysis. The TweenMotif program is available for download from the Baumann Lab web site, along with source code and sample analysis files. Determining the 5′ End of TER1—To appropriately characterize structure and function of an RNA, the 5′ and 3′ ends need to be accurately determined. The 5′ end of TER1 had previously been mapped by reverse transcribing this part of the RNA, followed by terminal transferase-mediated addition of a homooligomeric nucleotide tail for PCR amplification of the cDNA product (31Leonardi J. Box J.A. Bunch J.T. Baumann P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The reported 5′ end was based on four independently derived clones. Using a similar experimental approach, Webb and Zakian (32Webb C.J. Zakian V.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) identified two alternative starting positions: one 6 nucleotides further upstream and another one 1 nucleotide downstream. Shorter clones could be the product of degradation or may reflect naturally occurring 5′ end heterogeneity, as reported for budding yeast (14Dandjinou A.T. Levesque N. Larose S. Lucier J.F. Abou Elela S. Wellinger R.J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1148-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have now used reverse transcription from a radiolabeled primer to quantitatively assess the abundance of different 5′ ends in multiple RNA samples (Fig. 1). The dominant end (52%) was observed at position -6 relative to that of our original clones isolated from total cellular RNA preparations and from affinity-purified telomerase. We will therefore refer to this position as +1 from here onwards. Interestingly, a band at position -1 was observed in oligo(dT)-purified RNA (Fig. 1, lane 8), suggesting that longer transcripts may be processed to the +1 position prior to capping. An Essential Paired Element Borders the Template Region—We previously reported that a nucleotide substitution in TER1 at position 233 (formerly 227) results in corresponding changes in telomeric DNA, suggesting that G233 is part of the template (31Leonardi J. Box J.A. Bunch J.T. Baumann P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, a C232A mutation was not incorporated into telomeres, consistent with this residue being outside of the template. To elucidate what defines the 5′ boundary element, we examined the sequence and putative structure upstream of the template. In the absence of mutational studies or co-variation analysis, secondary structure elements are inherently difficult to predict for large RNAs. Despite this caveat, we were intrigued to find that Mfold software predicts RNA sequences upstream of the template to be base-paired. The two most commonly observed folds are shown in Fig. 2A. The structure shown on top forms a longer, energetically favored helix including a bulged U at position 231. However, two nucleotides that are part of the template (U234 and G233) are engaged in base pairing interactions. If this conformation exists in vivo, the pairing at the base of the stem would have to be disrupted in most rounds of extension because at least U234 is copied 80% of the time (31Leonardi J. Box J.A. Bunch J.T. Baumann P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In an alternative local structure, the bulged U231 forms a G:U wobble, with G161 placing the start of the helix two nucleotides away from the 5′ end of the template (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). To test whether base pairing upstream of the template is critical for telomerase function, we substituted four nucleotides with their Watson-Crick complementary base in the two regions predicted to form the paired element. Disruption mutant A (DMA) 3The abbreviations used are:DMAdisruption mutant ADMBdisruption mutant BCMcompensatory mutant. replaces nucleotides 163-166 in the distal paired element with the complementary sequence of the template-proximal paired element, thereby disrupting the predicted pairing interactions (Fig. 2B). Reciprocally, disruption mutant B (DMB) replaces nucleotides 226-229 in the template-proximal paired element. We also generated a compensatory mutant (CM) that combines the mutant sequences of DMA and DMB, thereby restoring the potential for base pairing while changing the sequence of both paired elements (Fig. 2B). Computational analysis of DMA and DMB using Mfold predicted that these sequence changes disrupted the putative helix and the central domain of the predicted structure without affecting the global fold of the RNA. Similarly, in silico folding supported that CM would restore the predicted pairing interactions while maintaining the same global fold (data not shown). disruption mutant A disruption mutant B compensatory mutant. The three mutant RNA subunits, as well as wild type TER1 and empty vector controls were introduced into a ter1+/- diploid strain. Transformants were selected and sporulated to derive haploid strains containing the respective plasmid but lacking the genomic copy of ter1+. These strains were propagated for ∼70 generations prior to analyzing telomere length. At this point, cells containing the vector control had lost most telomeric repeats (Fig. 2C, lane 1). In contrast, cells harboring a copy of the wild type ter1+ gene maintained normal telomeres (lane 2). The DMA and DMB cells had very short telomeres, indicating that telomerase activity was compromised (lanes 3-6). Combining the deleterious DMA and DMB mutations in the CM restored normal telomere length (lanes 7 and 8). Northern blotting confirmed that telomere shortening in the DMA and DMB mutants is not a consequence of reduced TER1 RNA levels (Fig. 2D). These results support that the computationally predicted helix downstream of the template exists in vivo. Disruption of the paired region compromises telomerase function, whereas restoring base pairing with a different sequence was sufficient to rescue telomerase function to wild type levels. The Paired Region Functions as a Boundary Element in Vivo and in Vitro—To characterize the effects of the paired element mutations more directly, we introduced them into a pre-senescent ter1- strain containing Myc epitope-tagged Trt1. Telomerase was immunopurified from extracts, and activity was assayed on beads (35Haering C.H. Nakamura T.M. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6367-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using an S. pombe telomeric primer ending in the sequence... GGTTACG-3′, wild type telomerase added up to six nucleotides with a dominant pausing site at position +4 (Fig. 3A). Previous work using the same primer and assay conditions showed that nucleotide incorporation was consistent with addition of the sequence 5′-GTTACA-3′ (31Leonardi J. Box J.A. Bunch J.T. Baumann P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity was 3.3- and 2.5-fold reduced for the DMA and DMB mutants, respectively. Despite the reduction in overall activity, incorporation of an additional nucleotide was observed for DMA and, to a lesser extent, for DMB (Fig. 3A). Reverse transcription did not technically extend beyond the last nucleotide of the flexible template boundary, but this last nucleotide, G233, is only used ≤8% of the time in vivo. To assess whether the DMA and DMB mutations caused a shift toward longer repeat units in vivo, we cloned telomeres from cells expressing each telomerase RNA and compared the frequencies of the three most common repeats with wild type. The sequence GGTTACA(G), describing the most common repeat for wild type telomeres, was only modestly reduced in DMA and DMB strains (Fig. 3B). However, the extended repeat described by the sequence GGTTACAC(G) was over 4-fold more abundant in telomeres generated in the presence of DMA. Conversely, the frequency of short GGTTAC(G) repeats was proportionally reduced in this mutant (Fig. 3B). Despite the presence of similarly short telomeres in DMB, the shift toward longer repeat units was not apparent for this mutant (Fig. 3B). Closer examination of 83 telomeres cloned from the DMA mutant revealed direct evidence for reverse transcription of nontemplate nucleotides, with the sequence 5′-ACACGA-3′ (bold nucleotides are encoded by C232 and U231 5′ of the template; see Fig. 2, A and B) being identified (Fig. 3C). On two occasions telomeres terminated in this sequence, and in one instance the sequence was followed by a stutter of six guanosines at the start of the next repeat. In the remaining two cases, found within the same telomere, the sequence ACACGA was followed by TTA, suggesting that reverse transcription beyond the template had resulted in the use of an alternative register of alignment in the following cycle. Evidence for reverse transcription beyond the template was also observed in the DMB strain, whereas telomere sequences from the CM strain were indistinguishable from wild type (data not shown). The presence of the ACACGA sequence at the ends of telomeres and preceding aberrant repeats indicates that additional rounds of telomerase action are compromised once read-through into telomere-adjacent sequences has occurred. Read-through products may also be subject to exonucleolytic degradation because protection by telomere-binding proteins is compromised by the nontelomeric sequence. This may explain why read-through products were detected in <10% of telomeres from the mutant strains. Taken together, these results provide strong support for a paired region 5′ of the template acting as a boundary element in vivo. An Extended Helix Shortens Repeat Length and Compromises Telomere Maintenance—Pairing of nucleotides immediately 5′ of the template with a distal element in the RNA appears to be the most widespread solution for defining the template boundary of telomerase in different species. However, unlike other species where the paired element is either directly adjacent or several nucleotides away from the template itself, the paired region and the template overlap by two nucleotides in the energetically favored conformation of fission yeast TER1. We hypothesized that telomere repeat heterogeneity in fission yeast may be a direct consequence of this overlap. To test whether a longer, more stable boundary element would result in a greater abundance of short repeats, we extended the potential for base pairing by replacing two nucleotides upstream of the distal paired element (Fig. 4A). If a telomeric DNA end aligns with G241, only the first four of the eight bases that normally constitute the template are unpaired in this ter1-17 mutant. Cells expressing ter-17 in place of wild type ter1+ had only slightly shortened telomeres (Fig. 4B). The overall reduction in telomere hybridization signal relative to the loading control may be due to the reduced ability of a wild type telomere probe to hybridize to the telomeric repeats generated in this mutant. Alternatively, or in addition, a fraction of telomeres may have been lost altogether as a consequence of the mutation. Although we did not further investigate the latter possibility, telomeric hybridization of similar intensity was observed after 40 and 70 generations, arguing against the possibility that the cultures were being taken over by survivors with circular chromosomes ("
https://openalex.org/W2152773856,"Background Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) may be zoonotic. Recently the “immuno-modulators” methotrexate, azathioprine and 6-MP and the “anti-inflammatory” 5-ASA have been shown to inhibit MAP growth in vitro. We concluded that their most plausible mechanism of action is as antiMAP antibiotics. The “immunosuppressants” Cyclosporine A, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus (FK 506) treat a variety of “autoimmune” and “inflammatory” diseases. Rapamycin and Tacrolimus are macrolides. We hypothesized that their mode of action may simply be to inhibit MAP growth. Methodology The effect on radiometric MAP 14CO2 growth kinetics of Cyclosporine A, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus on MAP cultured from humans (Dominic & UCF 4) or ruminants (ATCC 19698 & 303) and M. avium subspecies avium (ATCC 25291 & 101) are presented as “percent decrease in cumulative GI” (%-ΔcGI.) Principal Findings The positive control clofazimine has 99%-ΔcGI at 0.5 µg/ml (Dominic). Phthalimide, a negative control has no dose dependent inhibition on any strain. Against MAP there is dose dependent inhibition by the immunosuppressants. Cyclosporine has 97%-ΔcGI by 32 µg/ml (Dominic), Rapamycin has 74%-ΔcGI by 64 µg/ml (UCF 4) and Tacrolimus 43%-ΔcGI by 64 µg/ml (UCF 4) Conclusions We show heretofore-undescribed inhibition of MAP growth in vitro by “immunosuppressants;” the cyclic undecapeptide Cyclosporine A, and the macrolides Rapamycin and Tacrolimus. These data are compatible with our thesis that, unknowingly, the medical profession has been treating MAP infections since 1942 when 5-ASA and subsequently azathioprine, 6-MP and methotrexate were introduced in the therapy of some “autoimmune” and “inflammatory” diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2142638061,"A network of frontal and parietal brain regions is commonly recruited during tasks that require the deliberate ‘top-down’ control of thought and action. Previously, using simple target detection, we have demonstrated that within this frontoparietal network, the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in particular is sensitive to the presentation of target objects. Here, we use a range of target/non-target morphs to plot the target selective response within distinct frontoparietal sub-regions in greater detail. The increased resolution allows us to examine the extent to which different cognitive factors can predict the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response to targets. Our results reveal that both probability of positive identification (similarity to target) and proximity to the 50% decision boundary (ambiguity) are significant predictors of BOLD signal change, particularly in the right VLPFC. Furthermore, the profile of target related signal change is not static, with the degree of selectivity increasing as the task becomes familiar. These findings demonstrate that frontoparietal sub-regions are recruited under increased cognitive demand and that when recruited, they adapt, using both fast and slow mechanisms, to selectively respond to those items that are of the most relevance to current intentions."
https://openalex.org/W1975993695,"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) is overexpressed in solid tumors and leukemia. However, the mechanism of SPHK1 overexpression by oncogenes has not been defined. We found that v-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells showed a high SPHK1 mRNA, SPHK1 protein and SPHK enzyme activity. siRNA of SPHK1 inhibited the growth of v-Src-NIH3T3, suggesting the involvement of SPHK1 in v-Src-induced oncogenesis. v-Src-NIH3T3 showed activations of protein kinase C-α, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Their inhibition suppressed SPHK1 expression in v-Src-NIH3T3, whereas their overexpression increased SPHK1 mRNA in NIH3T3. Unexpectedly, the nuclear run-on assay and the promoter analysis using 5′-promoter region of mouse SPHK1 did not show any significant difference between mock- and v-Src-NIH3T3. Furthermore, the half-life of SPHK1 mRNA in mock-NIH3T3 was nearly 15 min, whereas that of v-Src-NIH3T3 was much longer. Examination of two AU-rich region-binding proteins, AUF1 and HuR, that regulate mRNA decay reciprocally, showed decreased total AUF1 protein associated with increased tyrosine-phosphorylated form and increased serine-phosphorylated HuR protein in v-Src-NIH3T3. Modulation of AUF1 and HuR by their overexpression or siRNA revealed that SPHK1 mRNA in v-Src- and mock-NIH3T3 was regulated reciprocally by these factors. Our results showed, for the first time, a novel mechanism of v-Src-induced SPHK1 overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2003132649,"Background Pancreatic cancer cells generate metastases because they can survive the stress imposed by the new environment of the host tissue. To mimic this process, pancreatic cancer cells which are not stressed in standard culture conditions are injected into nude mice. Because they develop xenografts, they should have developed adequate stress response. Characterizing that response might provide new strategies to interfere with pancreatic cancer metastasis. Methodology/Principal Findings In the human pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1, Mia-PaCa2, Capan-1, Capan-2 and BxPC3, we used Affymetrix DNA microarrays to compare the expressions of 22.000 genes in vitro and in the corresponding xenografts. We identified 228 genes overexpressed in xenografts and characterized the implication of one of them, WSB1, in the control of apoptosis and cell proliferation. WSB1 generates 3 alternatively spliced transcripts encoding distinct protein isoforms. In xenografts and in human pancreatic tumors, global expression of WSB1 mRNA is modestly increased whereas isoform 3 is strongly overexpressed and isoforms 1 and 2 are down-regulated. Treating Mia-PaCa2 cells with stress-inducing agents induced similar changes. Whereas retrovirus-forced expression of WSB1 isoforms 1 and 2 promoted cell growth and sensitized the cells to gemcitabine- and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, WSB1 isoform 3 expression reduced cell proliferation and enhanced resistance to apoptosis, showing that stress-induced modulation of WSB1 alternative splicing increases resistance to apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. Conclusions/Significance Data on WSB1 regulation support the hypothesis that activation of stress-response mechanisms helps cancer cells establishing metastases and suggest relevance to cancer development of other genes overexpressed in xenografts."
https://openalex.org/W2028531522,"Keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR) is a splice variant of the FGFR2 gene expressed in epithelial cells. Activation of KGFR is a key factor in the regulation of physiological processes in epithelial cells such as proliferation, differentiation and wound healing. Alterations of KGFR signaling have been linked to the pathogenesis of different epithelial tumors. It has been also hypothesized that its specific ligand, KGF, might contribute to the development of resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in epithelial cancers and tamoxifen in estrogen-positive breast cancers.Small interfering RNA was transfected into a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), a breast cancer derived cell line (MCF-7) and a keratinocyte primary culture (KCs) to induce selective downregulation of KGFR expression. A strong and highly specific reduction of KGFR expression was observed at both RNA (reduction = 75.7%, P = 0.009) and protein level. KGFR silenced cells showed a reduced responsiveness to KGF treatment as assessed by measuring proliferation rate (14.2% versus 39.0% of the control cells, P<0.001) and cell migration (24.6% versus 96.4% of the control cells, P = 0.009). In mock-transfected MCF-7 cells, KGF counteracts the capacity of 5-FU to inhibit cell proliferation, whereas in KGFR silenced cells KGF weakly interferes with 5-FU antiproliferative effect (11.2% versus 28.4% of the control cells, P = 0.002). The capacity of 5-FU to induce cell death is abrogated by co-treatment with KGF, whereas in KGFR silenced cells 5-FU efficiently induces cell death even combined to KGF, as determined by evaluating cell viability. Similarly, the capacity of tamoxifen to inhibit MCF-7 and KCs proliferation is highly reduced by KGF treatment and is completely restored in KGFR silenced cells (12.3% versus 45.5% of the control cells, P<0.001).These findings suggest that selective inhibition of the KGF/KGFR pathway may provide a useful tool to ameliorate the efficacy of the therapeutic strategies for certain epithelial tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2020554336,"Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide (SPIO) complexed with cationic transfection agent is used to label various mammalian cells. Labeled cells can then be utilized as an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probes. However, certain number of in vivo administered labeled cells may be cleared from tissues by the host's macrophages. For successful translation to routine clinical application of SPIO labeling method it is important that this mode of in vivo clearance of iron does not elicit any diverse immunological effects. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that SPIO agent ferumoxides-protamine sulfate (FePro) incorporation into macrophages does not alter immunological properties of these cells with regard to differentiation, chemotaxis, and ability to respond to the activation stimuli and to modulate T cell response. We used THP-1 cell line as a model for studying macrophage cell type. THP-1 cells were magnetically labeled with FePro, differentiated with 100 nM of phorbol ester, 12-Myristate-13-acetate (TPA) and stimulated with 100 ng/ml of LPS. The results showed 1) FePro labeling had no effect on the changes in morphology and expression of cell surface proteins associated with TPA induced differentiation; 2) FePro labeled cells responded to LPS with slightly higher levels of NFkappaB pathway activation, as shown by immunobloting; TNF-alpha secretion and cell surface expression levels of CD54 and CD83 activation markers, under these conditions, were still comparable to the levels observed in non-labeled cells; 3) FePro labeling exhibited differential, chemokine dependent, effect on THP-1 chemotaxis with a decrease in cell directional migration to MCP-1; 4) FePro labeling did not affect the ability of THP-1 cells to down-regulate T cell expression of CD4 and CD8 and to induce T cell proliferation. Our study demonstrated that intracellular incorporation of FePro complexes does not alter overall immunological properties of THP-1 cells. The described experiments provide the model for studying the effects of in vivo clearance of iron particles via incorporation into the host's macrophages that may follow after in vivo application of any type of magnetically labeled mammalian cells. To better mimic the complex in vivo scenario, this model may be further exploited by introducing additional cellular and biological, immunologically relevant, components."
https://openalex.org/W2131155436,"Hollow smooth muscle organs such as the bladder undergo significant changes in wall tension associated with filling and distension, with attendant changes in muscle tone. Our previous study indicated that stretch induces Ca(2+) release occurs in the form of Ca(2+) sparks and Ca(2+) waves in urinary bladder myocytes. While, the mechanism underlying stretch-induced Ca2+ release in smooth muscle is unknown.We examined the transduction mechanism linking cell stretch to Ca(2+) release. The probability and frequency of Ca(2+) sparks induced by stretch were closely related to the extent of cell extension and the time that the stretch was maintained. Experiments in tissues and single myocytes indicated that mechanical stretch significantly increases the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the amplitude and duration of muscle contraction. Stretch-induced Ca(2+) sparks and contractility increases were abrogated by the NO inhibitor L-NAME and were also absent in eNOS knockout mice. Furthermore, exposure of eNOS null mice to exogenously generated NO induced Ca(2+) sparks. The soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ did not inhibit SICR, but this process was effectively blocked by the PI3 kinase inhibitors LY494002 and wortmannin; the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS were up-regulated by 204+/-28.6% and 258+/-36.8% by stretch, respectively. Moreover, stretch significantly increased the eNOS protein expression level.Taking together, these results suggest that stretch-induced Ca2+ release is NO dependent, resulting from the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway in smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2075490206,"Iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) is a key iron sensor that post-transcriptionally regulates mammalian iron homeostasis by binding to iron-responsive elements (IREs) in mRNAs that encode proteins involved in iron metabolism (e.g. ferritin and transferrin receptor 1). During iron deficiency, IRP2 binds IREs to regulate mRNA translation or stability, whereas during iron sufficiency IRP2 is degraded by the proteasome. Here, we identify an iron-independent IRP2 phosphorylation site that is regulated by the cell cycle. IRP2 Ser-157 is phosphorylated by Cdk1/cyclin B1 during G2/M and is dephosphorylated during mitotic exit by the phosphatase Cdc14A. Ser-157 phosphorylation during G2/M reduces IRP2 RNA-binding activity and increases ferritin synthesis, whereas Ser-157 dephosphorylation during mitotic exit restores IRP2 RNA-binding activity and represses ferritin synthesis.

Because the cellular response to iron depletion is G1/S cell cycle arrest, iron chelators are used clinically as anti-proliferative agents (7Buss J.L. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Curr. Med.

Although iron is essential for cellular proliferation, excess iron can be toxic due to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Cellular iron levels are therefore tightly regulated to maintain a balance between insufficient and excessive iron. IRP1 and IRP2 are the primary iron sensors in mammalian cells (1Hentze M.W.

IRPs are cytosolic RNA-binding proteins that post-transcriptionally regulate iron uptake by transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and divalent metal transporter 1, iron export by ferroportin, and iron storage by ferritin. When iron is limited, IRPs bind with high affinity to IREs located in the 5′-untranslated regions of ferritin and ferroportin, mRNAs and in the 3′-untranslated regions of TfR1 and divalent metal transporter 1 mRNAs. IRP binding during iron deficiency inhibits the translation of 5′-IRE-containing mRNAs (e.g. ferritin) and stabilizes 3′-IRE-containing mRNAs (e.g. TfR1). During iron sufficiency, IRPs lose affinity for IREs, stimulating the translation of 5′-IRE-containing mRNAs and destabilizing 3′-IRE-containing mRNAs. By regulating iron transport and sequestration, IRPs directly modulate the amount of bioavailable iron. IRPs also regulate other IRE-containing mRNAs that encode proteins involved in the citric acid cycle (mitochondrial aconitase) (11Gray N.K. Pantopoulos K. Dandekar T. Ackrell B.A.C Hentze M.W. Proc.

Petrak J. Cmejlova J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) mRNAs each contain an IRE that binds IRPs in vitro, but the physiological roles of these IREs in vivo have not been entirely determined. The expanding number of IRE-containing mRNAs suggests that IRPs have more extensive functions than originally thought. IRP1 and IRP2 share 64% sequence identity, but their RNA-binding activities are regulated by different mechanisms. Iron regulates IRP1 primarily by stimulating the assembly of an [4Fe-4S] cluster, which converts it from an RNA-binding protein into a cytosolic aconitase (16Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Tang C.K. Chin J. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7536-7540Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In contrast, IRP2 does not assemble an [4Fe-4S] cluster during iron sufficiency (17Phillips J.D. Guo B. Yu Y. Brown F.M. Leibold E.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) but is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (18Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

The exact mechanism for IRP2 iron-mediated degradation has remained elusive. In addition to iron, IRP RNA-binding activities are also regulated by hypoxia. IRP1 RNA-binding activity is decreased during hypoxia due to stabilization of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in the aconitase form of the protein (20Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Conversely, hypoxia increases IRP2 RNA-binding activity due to protein stabilization (21Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Schneider B.D. Leibold E.A.

The regulation of IRP RNA-binding activities by oxygen deserves significant consideration due to the hypoxic nature of most tissues. At physiological oxygen concentrations (3–6%), IRP1 exists primarily in its c-aconitase form, whereas IRP2 is stabilized and functions solely as an RNA-binding protein (23Meyron-Holtz E.G. Ghosh M.C. Rouault T.A. Science. 2004; 306: 2087-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In accordance, mouse models of IRP1 and IRP2 deficiency have revealed that IRP1 cannot fully compensate for a lack of IRP2 (24LaVaute T. Smith S. Cooperman S. Iwai K. Land W. Meyron-Holtz E.

IRP1 and IRP2 are also regulated by phosphorylation. Treatment of HL-60 and HEK293 cells with the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulates IRP1 phosphorylation at Ser-138 and Ser-711 (28Eisenstein R.S. Tuazon P.T.

Phosphorylation of IRP1 at Ser-711 inhibits the forward citrate to isocitrate aconitase reaction without altering RNA-binding activity (30Pitula J.S. Deck K.M. Clarke S.L. Anderson S.A. Vasanthakumar A. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10907-10912Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Ser-138 destabilizes the [4Fe-4S] cluster (32Brown N.M. Anderson S.A. Steffen D.W. Carpenter T.B. Kennedy M.C. Walden W.E. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15235-15240Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which increases RNA-binding activity and enhances the iron-mediated degradation of IRP1 (31Clarke S.L. Vasanthakumar A. Anderson S.A. Pondarre C. Koh C.M. Deck K.M. Pitula J.S. Epstein C.J. Fleming M.D. Eisenstein R.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). IRP2 is also phosphorylated in PMA-treated HL-60 cells (29Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). PMA increases IRP2 RNA binding by activating a latent pool of redox-sensitive IRP2. In that study, the identity of the phosphorylated residue(s) and the mechanism of IRP2 phosphorylation were not determined. Here, we identify an iron-independent IRP2 phosphorylation site that is regulated by the cell cycle. IRP2 Ser-157 is phosphorylated during G2/M by Cdk1/cyclin B1 and dephosphorylated during mitotic exit by Cdc14A. Ser-157 phosphorylation regulates IRP2 RNA-binding activity and ferritin expression during mitosis. Our data provide evidence for a mechanism to modulate iron bioavailability during the cell cycle. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The WT rat IRP2 cDNA was C-terminally tagged with 5×-Myc and cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) with NheI and XbaI. IRP2-Myc was cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) by engineering KpnI and ApaI restriction sites on the N and C termini, respectively, and was subsequently used to generate the S503A, S407A, and S157A IRP2-Myc mutants by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange). The WT human IRP2 cDNA was N-terminally tagged with 2×-FLAG and cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO with XhoI and ApaI. The S157A FLAG-IRP2 mutant was generated from WT FLAG-IRP2 by site-directed mutagenesis. A TEV-10×-His tag and an ApaI restriction site were engineered onto the C terminus of 2×-FLAG-IRP2. 2×-FLAG-IRP2-TEV-10×-His was cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO with XhoI and ApaI. The Myc-Cdc14A pcDNA3 plasmid was a kind gift from Jiri Lukas (Institute of Cancer Biology, Danish Cancer Society) (33Mailand N. Lukas C. Kaiser B.K. Jackson P.K. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 318-322Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and was used to generate the catalytically inactive C278S Cdc14A mutant by site-directed mutagenesis. All nucleotide changes generated by site-directed mutagenesis were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture—HEK293T, HEK293, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Flp-In T-REx-293 cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen), and 15 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells stably expressing WT FLAG-IRP2, S157A FLAG-IRP2, or FLAG-IRP2-TEV-His were generated by transfecting Flp-In T-REx-293 cells with the appropriate FLAG-IRP2 pcDNA5/FRT/TO plasmid and the Flp recombinase plasmid pOG44. Stable isogenic integrants were selected with 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen), and expression was induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). Cell Synchronization and Flow Cytometry—To inhibit Cdk1 activity, cells were treated with 10 μm purvalanol A (Calbiochem). To enrich for cells in G2/M, HEK293 or HeLa cells were treated with 1 μm nocodazole (Sigma) for 18 h. For nocodazole release experiments, nocodazole was removed by washing cells three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were harvested at the indicated times after release. Double-thymidine blocks were performed by treating HeLa cells with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 16 h. Cells were washed in PBS, split, and released into thymidine-free media for 10 h. Thymidine was added for an additional 16 h, and then cells were washed and released into thymidine-free media. At the indicated times, duplicate plates of cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (see below) for Western blot analysis or fixed with 70% ethanol for flow cytometry. After fixation, cells were rehydrated in PBS, stained with propidium iodide (Sigma), and analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences). Cell cycle distribution was modeled using ModFit software (Verity Software House). Antibodies—Antibodies used in this study include anti-Myc (9E10) (sc-40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (F3165, Sigma), anti-IRP2 (18Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anti-β-tubulin (69126, MP Biomedicals), anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser-10) (06-570, Upstate), anti-cyclin B1 (MAB3684, Chemicon), anti-ferritin (F5012, Sigma), anti-transferrin receptor (13-6800, Invitrogen), anti-phospho-Cdk1-Tyr15 (PA1–4617, Affinity BioReagents), and anti-Cdk1 (PSTAIR) (06-923, Upstate). The anti-phospho IRP2-Ser-157 antibody (IRP2-pS157) was generated by Covance (Denver, PA). Rabbits were immunized with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated phosphopeptide CKAGKLS(p)PLKVQ (amino acids 152–162) that was synthesized at the DNA/Peptide Facility at the University of Utah. IRP2-pSer-157 was purified by applying serum to a SulfoLink column (Pierce) coupled with the phosphopeptide. Eluted fractions were then applied to a SulfoLink column coupled with the unphosphorylated peptide. The unbound fractions containing IRP2-pSer-157 were assayed for specificity by dot blotting with the phosphopeptide and nonphosphopeptide. Specificity was also confirmed by Western blotting with WT and S157A FLAG-IRP2 expressing cellular extracts. Cytosolic Extract Preparation for Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitations—Protein extracts were prepared by lysing PBS-washed cells in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, and 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate) or Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, and 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate) for Cdc14A experiments. Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) were included in the lysis buffer for immunoprecipitations. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min, and protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie Plus reagent (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were performed in PBS with 6 μg of anti-Myc (Santa Cruz) or 6 μgof anti-FLAG (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Recombinant protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) was added for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with PBS containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, boiled in SDS-loading buffer, and loaded onto an 8% SDS-PAGE or 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). [32P]Orthophosphate Labeling and Phosphopeptide Mapping—HEK293T cells were transfected with IRP2-Myc. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, one plate of cells was treated with 100 μm deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) for 16 h, and one plate was left untreated. After 16 h, cells were prelabeled for 2 h with 2.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% Tris-dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 50 μm MG132 (Sigma). Because the DFO was removed during media exchange, 100 μm DFO was added back to the original DFO-treated plate. After the 2 h prelabel, 100 μg/ml ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) was added to the untreated plate, and cells were labeled for an additional 8 h in the presence of DFO or FAC. Cells were harvested with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and IRP2-Myc was immunoprecipitated from 2 mg of cellular extract with 10 μg of anti-Myc antibody and protein G-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was destained, dried, and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Radiolabeled IRP2-Myc was excised from the gel and digested with 10 μg of trypsin (Roche Applied Science) or 2.5 μgof Lys-C (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, at 37 °C overnight. The supernatant was recovered from the gel slices and lyophilized to dryness. Phosphopeptides were separated by two-dimensional peptide mapping as described (34Van der Geer P. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 31-59Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were suspended in electrophoresis buffer (2.5% formic acid, 7.8% acetic acid, pH 1.9) and spotted onto 20 × 20 cm cellulose TLC plates. Electrophoresis was carried out at 1300 V for 1 h. The plates were dried and subjected to ascending chromatography in phospho-chromatography buffer (62.5% isobutyric acid, 1.9% n-butanol, 4.8% pyridine, 2.9% acetic acid). Phosphopeptides were visualized with a PhosphorImager, scraped from the TLC plate, and eluted with electrophoresis buffer. Eluted phosphopeptides were subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis (34Van der Geer P. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 31-59Google Scholar) and Edman 32P-release sequencing, which was performed by the DNA/Peptide Facility (University of Utah) using previously described methods (35MacDonald J.A. Mackey A.J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A.J Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 314-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assays—WT or S157A FLAG-IRP2 was immunoprecipitated from tetracycline-induced T-REx-293 stable cells using 6 μg of anti-FLAG antibodies and protein G-agarose. The agarose beads were washed three times in PBS followed by a wash in Cdk kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Brij 35). Beads were then incubated with the indicated amounts of recombinant Cdk1-cyclin B1 or Cdk2-cyclin A (New England Biolabs), 200 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 1× Cdk kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Radioactivity was quantified with a PhosphorImager prior to immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg of total RNA, random primers, and SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using SYBR GreenER qPCR supermix (Invitrogen) and an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Primer sequences were previously described (14Sanchez M. Galy B. Dandekar T. Bengert P. Vainshtein Y. Stolte J. Muckenthaler M.U. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22865-22874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and relative amplification efficiencies were validated prior to using the comparative CT method to determine mRNA -fold change. The data represent the average ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical significance of the differences between time points within an individual transcript was determined by a one-way analysis of variance: *, p ≤ 0.0027. [35S]Methionine/Cysteine Labeling and Immunoprecipitations—HeLa cells synchronized by a double thymidine block were washed with PBS and cultured for the last 1.5 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (5% fetal bovine serum, Cys-, and Met-free) containing 100 μCi/ml (1175 Ci/mmol) Tran35S-Label (MP Biomedicals, Inc.). For immunoprecipitations, 300 μg of cell lysate was incubated with either 6 μl of anti-ferritin or 2 μl of anti-transferrin receptor antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Recombinant protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) was added for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with PBS containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, boiled in SDS-loading buffer, and resolved on 8% or 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were dried and analyzed by phosphorimaging. RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A [32P]GTP-labeled ferritin-L probe (100,000 cpm) was incubated with 12 μg of protein extract for 10 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of 20 units of RNase T1 (Roche Applied Science) and 100 μgof sodium heparin (Sigma) for 10 min each (36Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). IRP2 was supershifted with anti-IRP2 for 20 min, and RNA complexes were resolved by 5% non-denaturing PAGE. Band intensity was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Identification of an in Vivo Iron-independent IRP2 Phosphorylation Site—To identify in vivo IRP2 phosphorylation sites, HEK293T cells expressing IRP2-Myc were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Immunoprecipitated radiolabeled IRP2-Myc was analyzed by two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. The IRP2 tryptic peptide map yielded one major phosphorylated peptide (1) and two minor phosphorylated peptides (2 and 3), none of which were significantly altered by treatment with the iron chelator DFO or FAC (Fig. 1A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of peptide 1 revealed that IRP2 was phosphorylated on a serine(s) (Fig. 1B). To identify the major iron-independent IRP2 phosphorylation site (peptide 1), a strategy was devised employing Edman phosphate release sequencing and bioinformatics (37Mackey A.J. Haystead T.A.J Pearson W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3859-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Candidate phosphoamino acids were identified from the cleavage of radiolabeled phosphoprotein analysis (37Mackey A.J. Haystead T.A.J Pearson W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3859-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the cycle of Edman phosphate release. Tryptic peptide 1 released phosphate in Edman cycle 5 (Fig. 1C). Because bioinformatics indicated that four IRP2 tryptic peptides contained a serine in the fifth position, in vivo phosphorylated IRP2-Myc was subjected to Lys-C phosphopeptide mapping (data not shown) to narrow the number of candidate peptides. Edman phosphate release sequencing of the major Lys-C peptide also released phosphate in cycle 5 (Fig. 1C). Assuming complete digestion, this narrowed the candidate IRP2 phosphorylation sites to Ser-503 and Ser-735, while partial digestion also implicated Ser-407 and Ser-157 (Fig. 1D). Ser-735 is not conserved in IRP2 orthologues, so it was eliminated as a potential candidate. [32P]Orthophosphate labeling of HEK293T cells transfected with WT, S503A, S407A, or S157A IRP2-Myc indicated that S157A IRP2-Myc incorporated ∼70% less 32P than WT IRP2-Myc (Fig. 1E). These data identify Ser-157 as the major IRP2 phosphorylation site but show that IRP2 can be phosphorylated at other sites. Mass spectrometry of FLAG-IRP2-His purified from DFO- and FAC-treated HEK293 cells confirmed that Ser-157 is phosphorylated during iron deficiency and sufficiency (Table 1). Additionally, Ser-157 phosphorylation was not modulated by DFO or FAC treatment in HEK293 cells, as determined by Western blotting with IRP2 Ser-157 phosphospecific antibodies (IRP2-pS157) (“Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. S1), verifying that IRP2 Ser-157 phosphorylation is iron-independent (supplemental Fig. S2).TABLE 1Detection of IRP2 Ser-157 phosphorylation by mass spectrometrySequenceTheoretical molecular massDFOFACMH+MH22+MH+MH33+KLSPL636.325637.332637.334AGKLSPL764.383765.393KAGKLSPL892.478447.248AGKLSPLK892.478447.247AGKLSPLKVQPK1344.753449.259 Open table in a new tab IRP2 Ser-157 Is Phosphorylated during Mitosis by Cdk1/Cyclin B1—Ser-157 is conserved in IRP2 orthologues and is located within a canonical Cdk motif (SpPLK), which suggests that Ser-157 phosphorylation may be cell cycle-regulated. To determine whether IRP2 Ser-157 was a Cdk phosphorylation site, stably expressed FLAG-IRP2 was immunoprecipitated from asynchronous Flp-In T-REx 293 cells and used as a substrate for in vitro kinase assays with recombinant Cdk1/cyclin B1 or Cdk2/cyclin A.

Radiolabeled FLAG-IRP2 was not detected in the absence of exogenously added kinase, indicating that the endogenous Ser-157 kinase was not immunoprecipitated with FLAG-IRP2 (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 2 and 6).

This occurs through the transient repression in primordial germ cells of RNA polymerase II, specifically by disrupting Ser2 phosphorylation on its C-terminal domain. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that contrary to expectation the Drosophila polar granule component (pgc) gene functions as a protein rather than a non-coding RNA. Surprisingly, pgc encodes a 71-residue, dimeric, alpha-helical oligopeptide repressor. In vivo data show that Pgc ablates Ser2 phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain and completely suppresses early zygotic transcription in the soma. Conclusions/Significance We thus identify pgc as a novel oligopeptide that readily inhibits gene expression. Germ cell repression of transcription in Drosophila is thus catalyzed by a small inhibitor protein."
https://openalex.org/W2081344700,"Nematode infections are a ubiquitous feature of vertebrate life. In nature, such nematode infections are acquired by continued exposure to infective stages over a prolonged period of time. By contrast, experimental laboratory infections are typically induced by the administration of a single (and often large) dose of infective stages. Previous work has shown that the size of an infection dose can have significant effects on anti-nematode immune responses. Here we investigated the effect of different infection regimes of Strongyloides ratti, comparing single and repeated dose infections, on the host immune response that was elicited. We considered and compared infections of the same size, but administered in different ways. We considered infection size in two ways: the maximum dose of worms administered and the cumulative worm exposure time. We found that both infection regimes resulted in Th2-type immune response, characterised by IL4 and IL13 produced by S. ratti stimulated mesenteric lymph node cells, anti-S. ratti IgG(1) and intestinal rat mast cell protease II (RMCPII) production. We observed some small quantitative immunological differences between different infection regimes, in which the concentration of IL4, IL13, anti-S. ratti IgG(1) and IgG(2a) and RMCPII were affected. However, these differences were quantitatively relatively modest compared with the temporal dynamics of the anti-S. ratti immune response as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W2146142927,"The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) undergoes sequential proteolytic cleavages through the action of β- and γ-secretase, which result in the generation of toxic β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides and a C-terminal fragment consisting of the intracellular domain of APP (AICD). Mutations leading to increased APP levels or alterations in APP cleavage cause familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, identification of factors that regulate APP steady state levels and/or APP cleavage by γ-secretase is likely to provide insight into AD pathogenesis. Here, using transgenic flies that act as reporters for endogenous γ-secretase activity and/or APP levels (GAMAREP), and for the APP intracellular domain (AICDREP), we identified mutations in X11L and ubiquilin (ubqn) as genetic modifiers of APP. Human homologs of both X11L (X11/Mint) and Ubqn (UBQLN1) have been implicated in AD pathogenesis. In contrast to previous reports, we show that overexpression of X11L or human X11 does not alter γ-secretase cleavage of APP or Notch, another γ-secretase substrate. Instead, expression of either X11L or human X11 regulates APP at the level of the AICD, and this activity requires the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of X11. In contrast, Ubqn regulates the levels of APP: loss of ubqn function leads to a decrease in the steady state levels of APP, while increased ubqn expression results in an increase in APP levels. Ubqn physically binds to APP, an interaction that depends on its ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, suggesting that direct physical interactions may underlie Ubqn-dependent regulation of APP. Together, our studies identify X11L and Ubqn as in vivo regulators of APP. Since increased expression of X11 attenuates Aβ production and/or secretion in APP transgenic mice, but does not act on γ-secretase directly, X11 may represent an attractive therapeutic target for AD."

In contrast, the Escherichia coli RNAP is unable to initiate transcription from GGGA-containing promoters that lack the −35 element.

Most housekeeping promoters are recognized by RNAP holoenzyme containing the major σ subunit (called σ70 in Escherichia coli or σA in other bacteria). The −10 (TATAAT) and the −35 (TTGACA) consensus elements of these promoters interact with conserved regions 2.4 and 4.2 of σ, respectively (1Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A subset of promoters (the so-called extended −10 promoters) contain a TG motif one nucleotide upstream of the −10 element that is recognized by region 2.5 of σ; these promoters do not require the −35 element for their activity (2Barne K.A.

In addition to specific interactions with conserved promoter elements, nonspecific RNAP-DNA interactions also contribute to promoter recognition.

Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29710-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sigma subunits of the σ70 class are unable to recognize promoters in the absence of the RNAP core. We have recently demonstrated that isolated σA from thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus can recognize single-stranded DNA aptamers (sTaps, for sigma T. aquaticus aptamers) that contain a −10-like element followed by the tetranucleotide motif GGGA (8Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E. Stavrovskaya E. Klimasauskas S. Nikiforov V. Heyduk T. Severinov K. Kulbachinskiy A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Using site-specific DNA-protein cross-linking, we demonstrated that the GGGA motif interacts with region 1.2 of σA. Furthermore, double-stranded DNA fragments based on sTap sequences served as efficient promoters for T. aquaticus RNAP holoenzyme, and their recognition depended on the presence of the GGGA motif but did not require the presence of the −35 promoter element or the TG motif characteristic of extended −10 promoters. Thus, the GGGA motif is a bona fide basal promoter element for T. aquaticus RNAP. Indeed, we found that similar motifs are present in natural promoters and increase stability of promoter complexes of RNAPs from T. aquaticus and related bacteria (8Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E. Stavrovskaya E. Klimasauskas S. Nikiforov V. Heyduk T. Severinov K. Kulbachinskiy A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics analysis suggested that up to 33% of predicted promoters in the genome of Thermus thermophilus contain GGGA-like motifs. In contrast, no preference for such motifs was found in E. coli promoter sequences (8Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E.

In a parallel study, it was shown that E. coli RNAP σ70 holoenzyme can also specifically recognize promoter region immediately downstream of the −10 consensus element (9Haugen S.P. Berkmen M.B. Ross W. Gaal T. Ward C. Gourse R.L. Cell. 2006; 125: 1069-1082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because of the apparent ability of this promoter region to mediate stringent response-dependent inhibition of transcription from E. coli rRNA and tRNA promoters, it was termed “discriminator” (10Travers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 973-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substitutions in this region (including a C to G substitution in this region 2 base pairs downstream of the −10 element) in the E. coli rrnB P1 promoter were demonstrated to dramatically increase promoter complex stability (9Haugen S.P. Berkmen M.B. Ross W. Gaal T. Ward C. Gourse R.L. Cell. 2006; 125: 1069-1082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, residues 99–107 from σ70 region 1.2 cross-linked to photoreactive G-nucleotide analogues introduced one and two base pairs downstream of −10 elements of rrnB P1 and λ PR promoters (9Haugen S.P.

Therefore, G nucleotides at these positions are likely specifically recognized by σ70 region 1.2, and this interaction apparently stabilizes promoter complexes. Surprisingly, however, RNAPs from T. aquaticus and E. coli were found to differ in recognition of promoters containing the GGGA element (8Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I.

Although in the case of T. aquaticus RNAP, the −10 element and the GGGA element were sufficient for transcription initiation, E. coli RNAP required the −35 element whether the GGGA element was present or not. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the observed species specificity of promoter recognition and analyzed the roles of different structural elements of the T. aquaticus RNAP holoenzyme in the recognition of promoters containing the GGGA element.

The library used for the selection was based on the sequence of the 75-nucleotide-long sTap2 aptamer and contained a random region in place of the GGGA motif (see Fig. 2A). The library (100 pmol) was incubated with either wild type T. aquaticus σA or chimeric σ eT in 300 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 240 mm NaCl, and 60 mm KCl for 30 min at 25 °C. 15 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was added, and incubation continued for 20 min with occasional shaking. The sorbent was washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer (for a total time of 30 min), and the σ-DNA complexes were eluted with 300 μl of binding buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluted DNA was amplified using primers corresponding to fixed regions of the library (PL, 5′-GGGAGCTCAGAATAAACGCTCAA; PR, BBB-5′-GATCCGGGCCTCATGTCGAA, where B is a biotin residue). Two DNA strands were separated by size on 10% denaturing PAGE, and the non-biotinylated strand was used for the next round of selection. After three rounds of selection, the enriched library was amplified with primers containing EcoRI and HindIII sites and cloned into the pUC19 plasmid. In Vitro Transcription—Double-stranded DNA fragments containing aptamer sequences were prepared by PCR from the aptamer pUC19 clones as described (8Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E.

Holoenzymes were prepared by incubating the core enzyme (100 nm) with σ (500 nm) for 5 min at 25 °C. Promoter DNA fragments were added to 50 nm, and the samples were incubated for 15 min at temperatures indicated in the figure legends. NTPs were added to 100 μm (including 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP), and transcription was performed for 10 min. In open complex stability measurements, heparin was added (50 μg/ml) at different time points prior to NTP addition, and the transcription reaction was performed for 3 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of a stop buffer containing 8 m urea and 20 mm EDTA. The RNA products were separated by 15% denaturing PAGE and analyzed by phosphorimaging. The Specificity of Recognition of GGGA-containing Promoters Is Determined by the Core Enzyme of RNAP—In our previous study, we demonstrated that T. aquaticus σA RNAP holoenzyme but not E. coli σ70 RNAP holoenzyme is able to initiate transcription on synthetic promoters based on aptamers specific to σA (sTaps) (8Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E. Stavrovskaya E. Klimasauskas S. Nikiforov V. Heyduk T. Severinov K. Kulbachinskiy A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recognition of these promoters by T. aquaticus σA RNAP holoenzyme depends on the GGGA element located immediately downstream of the −10 promoter consensus element and does not require either the −35 or the TG promoter elements. The ability of thermophilic T. aquaticus RNAP but not the mesophilic E. coli RNAP to initiate transcription on sTap-based promoters could be due to higher temperature optimum of the former enzyme, because high temperature facilitates DNA melting, including localized melting of promoter DNA. To test the role of reaction temperature on transcription from sTap promoters, we performed transcription on one of the promoters, sTap2, with E. coli and T. aquaticus RNAPs at temperatures varying from 37 to 55 °C (Fig. 1). As a control, we analyzed the temperature dependence of transcription from the T7 A1 promoter, a strong −10/–35 class promoter. Because the control template also contained a downstream λ tR2 terminator, transcription from this template resulted in two (terminated and “run-off”) transcripts. We found that T. aquaticus RNAP was active on both templates at all of the temperatures tested, although its activity at 37 °C was much lower than at 55 °C, as expected (Fig. 1, lanes 1–4). In contrast, E. coli RNAP, although active on the T7 A1 promoter at all of the temperatures tested (Fig. 1, lanes 5–8, lower panel), was unable to transcribe from sTap2 (Fig. 1, lanes 5–8, upper panel). Thus, the absence of transcription from the sTap template by the E. coli RNAP (and conversely, efficient transcription by the T. aquaticus enzyme from this template) cannot be explained by nonspecific stimulation of promoter melting at high temperature. In agreement with published data (19Wilson K.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the efficiency of transcription termination (measured as a ratio of the terminated transcript to the sum of terminated and run-off transcripts) by E. coli core RNAP on λ tR2 was dramatically increased at high temperatures (Fig. 1, lower panel, lanes 5–8 and 9–12). In contrast, termination efficiency of T. aquaticus RNAP did not depend on temperature within the range studied (Fig. 1, lower panel, lanes 1–4). The result may indicate that at high temperatures, elongation complexes of T. aquaticus RNAP are more stable than E. coli RNAP complexes. Such higher stability may be adaptive for an obligate thermophile such as T. aquaticus and allow the synthesis of full-sized transcripts to occur. Because the GGGA element was first identified in single-stranded DNA aptamers specific to T. aquaticus σA subunit, one could expect that the inability of E. coli RNAP holoenzyme to initiate transcription on promoters containing this element is entirely due to the inability of σ70 to recognize this element. To test this, we analyzed transcription by a hybrid holoenzyme consisting of E. coli core and T. aquaticus σA. This RNAP was active on the T7 A1 promoter at all of the temperatures tested but was unable to initiate transcription on the sTap2 promoter (Fig. 1, lanes 9–12). Thus, T. aquaticus σA cannot promote transcription initiation on sTap2 by E. coli core, even though it recognizes the GGGA element both in aptamers and, in the context of T. aquaticus RNAP holoenzyme, in promoters. The result thus suggests that the inability of E. coli σ70 holoenzyme to recognize the sTap2 promoter is determined by the core enzyme and not by the σ70 subunit. E. coli σ70 Region 1.2 Specifically Recognizes the GGGA Element in Aptamers and Promoters—Because E. coli σ70 does not form an active holoenzyme with T. aquaticus core RNAP (12Kulbachinskiy A. Bass I. Bogdanova E. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7818-7820Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Kuznedelov K. Minakhin L. Severinov K. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we could not directly test its ability to recognize sTap-based promoters in complex with T. aquaticus RNAP core. Therefore, to analyze the specificity of σ70 interactions with DNA immediately downstream of the −10 element, we performed in vitro oligonucleotide selection using a library based on the previously characterized σA-specific sTap2 aptamer in which the region corresponding to the GGGA element was randomized (Fig. 2A). It should be noted that specific recognition of sTap2 by the σA subunit depends on aptamer contacts with several parts of the σ subunit, including regions 1.2, 2, and 4 (Ref. 8Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E. Stavrovskaya E. Klimasauskas S. Nikiforov V. Heyduk T. Severinov K. Kulbachinskiy A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar and unpublished data). Thus, to specifically probe the interactions of σ70 region 1.2 with the GGGA element, we performed oligonucleotide selection using a chimeric σA subunit in which the N-terminal part, including the entire region 1.2, was replaced with a corresponding sequence from σ70 (σ eT, E. coli σ70 amino acids 1–127 introduced instead of T. aquaticus σA amino acids 1–125). As a control, we performed the same selection with wild type σA. After three rounds of selection, enriched libraries were cloned, and sequences of five randomly chosen clones from each library were determined. In both cases, most clones contained the original GGGA motif (Fig. 2A). The result suggests that σ70 region 1.2 recognizes the GGGA element in single-stranded DNA aptamers with the same specificity as region 1.2 of T. aquaticus σA. We next asked whether σ70 region 1.2 can also recognize the GGGA element in sTap-based promoters. To test this, we performed transcription from an sTap2-based template using RNAP holoenzyme reconstituted from T. aquaticus core enzyme and chimeric σ subunit eT (Fig. 2B). The reconstituted holoenzyme efficiently transcribed from both the T7 A1 control template and from the sTap2 promoter template (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4). Thus, when in the context of T. aquaticus RNAP holoenzyme, σ70 region 1.2 is able to recognize the GGGA element in the sTap2 promoter. At the same time, holoenzyme reconstituted from the E. coli core enzyme, and the σ eT subunit was unable to transcribe from the sTap2 template (Fig. 2B, lane 6), thus providing additional evidence that the inability of E. coli RNAP to recognize this promoter is determined by the core enzyme. The GGGA Element Stabilizes Promoter Complexes Formed by the E. coli σ70 RNAP Holoenzyme—The results of experiments presented in the previous section demonstrate that region 1.2 of E. coli σ70 can specifically recognize the GGGA element both in single-stranded aptamers and in sTap-based promoters. Because the E. coli σ70 holoenzyme RNAP is inactive on GGGA-containing promoters lacking the −35 element, we asked whether it can specifically recognize this element when the −35 element is present. To test this, we analyzed transcription by the E. coli σ70 RNAP holoenzyme from two variants of the sTap2 promoter containing consensus −35 promoter element introduced 18 nucleotides upstream of the −10 element (8Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E. Stavrovskaya E. Klimasauskas S. Nikiforov V. Heyduk T. Severinov K. Kulbachinskiy A. Mol.

Previously, we demonstrated that the −35 element artificially placed at this promoter position in galP1 and sTap2 templates could be efficiently recognized by E. coli RNAP (7Minakhin L. Severinov K.

The first variant, sTap2+35, contained both the GGGA element and the −35 element; the second, sTap2+35-GGGA, contained the −35 element but had the GGGA sequence replaced with CCCT (Fig. 3A). In agreement with published data (8Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E. Stavrovskaya E. Klimasauskas S. Nikiforov V. Heyduk T. Severinov K. Kulbachinskiy A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), E. coli RNAP efficiently transcribed from both promoters; the amount of run-off transcript synthesized from the template containing the GGGA element was higher (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). Remarkably, the amount of abortive transcripts (and the ratio of abortive to run-off transcripts) produced on the sTap2+35 template was much higher than that produced on sTap2+35-GGGA. Likewise, the T. aquaticus RNAP holoenzyme also synthesized much larger amounts of abortive RNAs on sTap2+35 compared with sTap2+35-GGGA (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). This indicated that in the presence of the −35 element, the GGGA element hinders promoter escape, presumably because it introduces additional point(s) of contact of RNAP with the promoter. We have previously reported that the GGGA element increases the stability of promoter complexes formed by T. aquaticus RNAP on promoters containing the −35 element (8Feklistov A. Barinova N. Sevostyanova A. Heyduk E. Bass I. Vvedenskaya I. Kuznedelov K. Merkiene E. Stavrovskaya E. Klimasauskas S. Nikiforov V. Heyduk T. Severinov K. Kulbachinskiy A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To test whether the GGGA element could play a similar role in promoter recognition by E. coli RNAP holoenzyme, we compared lifetimes of promoter complexes formed by E. coli σ70 holoenzyme on sTap2+35 and sTap2+35-GGGA promoters. The stabilities of promoter complexes were measured in a run-off transcription assay in the presence of heparin that was added at different time points prior to nucleotide addition (Fig. 3C). We found that complexes formed on sTap2+35 were stable and dissociated with a half-life of about 1 h. In contrast, complexes formed on sTap2+35-GGGA were highly unstable, with a half-life of less than 1 min (Fig. 3D). Thus, the GGGA element greatly stabilizes promoter complexes formed by E. coli RNAP holoenzyme on the −10/–35 type promoters. Recognition of Promoters Containing the GGGA Element by T. aquaticus RNAP Depends on the Presence of σ Region 4, αCTDs, and the β Flap Domain—Because σ subunits of both T. aquaticus and E. coli RNAPs recognize the GGGA element but only the former enzyme can initiate transcription from GGGA-containing promoters in the absence of the −35 element, specific RNAP interactions with GGGA cannot be sufficient for efficient recognition of this type of promoters. Previous studies demonstrated that nonspecific RNAP contacts with upstream promoter sequences play an essential role in promoter recognition by E. coli RNAP (see Introduction). In particular, nonspecific contacts of αCTDs and σ region 4 with promoter DNA increase the efficiency of transcription initiation on different types of promoters (5Davis C.A. Capp M.W. Record Jr., M.T. Saecker R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Ross W. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, in the context of the E. coli σ70 RNAP holoenzyme, the flexible flap domain of the β subunit is required for proper positioning of σ region 4 to allow efficient recognition of the −35 promoter element (16Kuznedelov K. Minakhin L. Niedziela-Majka A. Dove S.L. Rogulja D. Nickels B.E. Hochschild A. Heyduk T. Severinov K. Science. 2002; 295: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This suggests that the β flap may also promote nonspecific interactions of σ region 4 with DNA; however, this conjecture has not been tested directly. Finally, T. aquaticus core RNAP contains an insertion of a large nonconserved domain at the N terminus of the β′ subunit (β′NCD), which interacts with the σ subunit (in a nonconserved segment between regions 1 and 2) (14Kuznedelov K.

Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The β′NCD might therefore also contribute to the specificity of promoter recognition. To assess the role of these RNAP domains in the recognition of GGGA-containing promoters by T. aquaticus RNAP, we analyzed T. aquaticus RNAP mutants with deletions of β′NCD (Δβ′NCD, β′ amino acids 159–453 removed), αCTDs (ΔαCTD, α amino acids 230–313 removed; this RNAP also harbored deletion of the β′NCD), region 4.2 of the σA subunit (Δσ4, σ amino acids 391–438 removed), and the β flap domain (Δβflap, β amino acids 757–786 removed). The activities of the wild type and mutant T. aquaticus RNAPs on different variants of the sTap2 promoter were compared with activities on control promoters T7 A1 and galP1 (an extended −10 promoter). The variants of the sTap2 promoter included wild type sTap2, sTap2-GGGA (in which the GGGA element was replaced with CCCT), sTap2+35, and sTap2+35-GGGA (Fig. 3A). The results are presented in Fig. 4.

This function is achieved by a complex antioxidant defence system composed of redox-active proteins and low MW antioxidants. Here, we disrupted the P. berghei plasmoredoxin gene that encodes a parasite-specific 22 kDa member of the thioredoxin superfamily. The successful generation of plasmoredoxin knockout mutants in the rodent model malaria parasite and phenotypic analysis during life cycle progression revealed a non-vital role in vivo. Our findings suggest that plasmoredoxin fulfils a specialized and dispensable role for Plasmodium and highlights the need for target validation to inform drug development strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2151011428,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is believed to initiate somatic hypermutation (SHM) by deamination of deoxycytidines to deoxyuridines within the immunoglobulin variable regions genes. The deaminated bases can subsequently be replicated over, processed by base excision repair or mismatch repair, leading to introduction of different types of point mutations (G/C transitions, G/C transversions and A/T mutations). It is evident that the base excision repair pathway is largely dependent on uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) through its uracil excision activity. It is not known, however, which endonuclease acts in the step immediately downstream of UNG, i.e. that cleaves at the abasic sites generated by the latter. Two candidates have been proposed, an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE) and the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 complex. The latter is intriguing as this might explain how the mutagenic pathway is primed during SHM. We have investigated the latter possibility by studying the in vivo SHM pattern in B cells from ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (Mre11 deficient) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS1 deficient) patients. Our results show that, although the pattern of mutations in the variable heavy chain (VH) genes was altered in NBS1 deficient patients, with a significantly increased number of G (but not C) transversions occurring in the SHM and/or AID targeting hotspots, the general pattern of mutations in the VH genes in Mre11 deficient patients was only slightly altered, with an increased frequency of A to C transversions. The Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 complex is thus unlikely to be the major nuclease involved in cleavage of the abasic sites during SHM, whereas NBS1 might have a specific role in regulating the strand-biased repair during phase Ib mutagenesis."

In infected cells, HCV genomic single-stranded ∼9600-nucleotide RNA messenger directs the synthesis of the ∼3000-amino acid polyprotein precursor (4Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J.

The same genomic ssRNA serves as a template for the synthesis of the full-length minus strand, which is used for the overproduction of the virus-specific genomic ssRNA. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), represented by nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B), is a single subunit catalytic component of the viral replication machinery responsible for both of these steps.The catalytic domain of HCV RdRp has the “right-hand” configuration closely resembling those of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) (8Huang H.

The fingers and thumb subdomains of the HCV RdRp interact extensively with each other. This interaction is mediated by two loops (Λ1 and Λ2) emanating from the fingers subdomain (12Ago H. Adachi T.

The 32P-labeled RNA probe, containing 681-nucleotide Bsp120I/KpnI fragment, complementary to NS5B coding sequence, was synthesized by runoff in vitro transcription in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, purified as described below, and used for Northern hybridization. The specific activity of the 32P-labeled RNA was ∼2.0 × 109 cpm/μg.HCV subgenomic RNA for RdRp assays and transient replication assays was produced from ScaI-linearized pFK-I341PI-Luc/NS3-3′/Con1/ET plasmids, containing different mutations by runoff in vitro transcription with phage T7 RNA polymerase and purified according to Lohmann et al. (29Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, the 200-μl transcription reaction contained 5-10 μg of linearized DNA, 1 unit/μl T7 RNA polymerase, 2.5 mm NTPs, and 0.4 unit/μl RNase inhibitor in optimized transcription buffer (Promega) complemented by dithiothreitol. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, 1 unit of RQ1 DNase per 1 μg of DNA was added for 30 min. The samples were phenol/chloroform-extracted, RNA-precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and pellet-washed several times with 70% ethanol. RNA pellet was dried and suspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. To remove contaminating NTPs, RNA templates were additionally purified on Sephadex G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Resulting A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios for HCV subgenomic RNA exceeded 2.1 as determined by ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.). Integrity of RNA was confirmed by denaturing formaldehyde gel electrophoresis.To produce the 32P-labeled RNA for nitrocellulose filter binding assays 5′-phosphates of poly(rC) and HCV subgenomic RNA were removed with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction was carried out for 3 h at 50 °C. The phage T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas MBI) was used to label the dephosphorylated RNA in a forward reaction using 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP as a substrate at 37 °C for 20 min. The RNA was purified as described above. The specific activity of the 32P-labeled RNA was ∼1.8×106 cpm/μg for poly(rC) and ∼0.5 × 106 cpm/μg for HCV subgenomic RNA.HCV RdRp and mAb Production and Purification—The E. coli) strain BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) was used for the expression of recombinant NS5B mutant proteins. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin. When cultures reached A600 = 0.6, protein expression was induced by 0.6 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside and further incubated at 17 °C for 16-18 h. N-terminal His10-tagged fusion mutant proteins were affinity-purified to near homogeneity by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography on Ni2+-Sepharose (Qiagen) according to Binder et al. (30Binder M. Quinkert D. Bochkarova O. Klein R. Kezmic N. Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5270-5283Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The NS5B was eluted with 1 ml of storage buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 30% glycerol, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin standard (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213177) Google Scholar). The protein was divided into smaller aliquots (NS5B concentrations were between 7.5 and 17.5 μm), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C.The HCV RdRp-specific mAbs were purified from ascitic fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation and protein G affinity chromatography on a standard fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare) according to Juronen et al. (32Juronen E. Parik J. Toomik P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 136: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The IgG concentration was estimated at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.4 and using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) with IgG antibody standard. The purified mAbs were stored either as ammonium sulfate precipitates in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C or in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50% glycerol at -20 °C. For all functional assays, mAb buffer was exchanged to TN buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) by consecutive diluting and concentrating the samples using Amicon ultracentrifugal (Millipore) filter unit devices.Primer-dependent and de Novo RdRp Assays—For primer-dependent RdRp assay poly(rC) was mixed with (rG)12 primer, denatured at 95 °C for 2 min, and incubated 5 min at 4 °C prior to use. For primer-independent (de novo) RdRp assay, HCV subgenomic RNA was denatured similarly.Primer-dependent RdRp assays containing 0.12 μm HCV NS5B, 0.4 μg of poly(rC) pre-annealed with 4 pmol of (rG)12 primer, and various mAbs concentrations (0.048-1.2 μm) were performed in RP buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, 10 units of RNasin (Promega)) in a total volume of 25 μl. Because of the addition of HCV RdRp and mAb, the reactions also contained 40 mm NaCl, 0.04% Triton X-100, 5 mm imidazole, 0.6% glycerol, and 0.2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. If not otherwise indicated, in primer-dependent RdRp reactions the NS5B and mAbs were preincubated at 4 °C for 10 min, after that RNA was added and incubation was extended for another 10 min at 4 °C. The RdRp reactions were initiated by the addition of NTPs CTP, UTP, and ATP at a final concentration of 0.5 mm each and 1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP per reaction. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. For the single cycle RdRp assays, heparin (at 5 μg/ml final concentration) was added simultaneously with NTPs. The primer-dependent RdRp assays for different HCV NS5B mutant enzymes were performed similarly but without preincubations and in the absence of mAbs and heparin. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid, 0.5% tetrasodium pyrophosphate (Na4PPi), and 100 μg of herring sperm DNA. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the samples were filtered through glass microfiber GF/C filters (Whatman and Schleicher & Schuell), washed with 1% trichloroacetic acid, containing 0.1% Na4PPi, and dried for 15 min at 56 °C. The bound radioactivity was then measured by liquid scintillation counting of [32P]GMP incorporated into synthesized RNA.Primer-independent (de novo) RdRp assays were performed exactly as primer-dependent assays with the following exceptions. HCV NS5B concentration was adjusted to 0.36 μm; HCV subgenomic RNA was used at a concentration 0.012 μm, and mAbs concentrations were between 0.144 and 3.6 μm. After NS5B, mAb, and RNA preincubations, the RdRp reactions were initiated by the addition of NTPs GTP, UTP, and ATP at a final concentration of 0.5 mm each and 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP complemented with unlabeled 10 μm CTP per reaction. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h. After addition of 20 μg of glycogen and 0.3 m sodium acetate, the samples were extracted with acidic phenol and chloroform mixture; RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and the pellet was washed once with 70% ethanol. The RNA pellets were dissolved at 70 °C for 15 min in a 50% formamide, 0.25 mm EDTA, SDS, and 0.012% of bromphenol blue, xylene cyanol FF, ethidium bromide each. The samples were cooled at 4 °C prior to loading onto denaturing 6% formaldehyde agarose gel containing 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis was performed at 5 V/cm. Gels were dried, exposed, scanned with Typhoon Trio Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences), and analyzed using ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperRX x-ray films (Fuji).Inhibitory Concentration 50% (IC50) Determination—Because mAbs only partially blocked the HCV RdRp activity, both a residual activity and IC50 values were determined. IC50 (half-maximal effect) is expressed as the mean with a 95% confidence interval (CI). IC50 was estimated from the normalized HCV RdRp activity values plotted as a function of logarithmic mAb concentration fitted with a following four-parameter logistic Equation 1,y=B+(T-B)/(1+10(logIC50-logX)·n)(Eq. 1) where y is the response variable (cpm); X is the mAb concentration; IC50 is the concentration of mAb that provokes a response halfway between the residual activity response (B) and response in the absence of mAb (T), and n is the Hill slope factor. When the n value was set to 1, the three-parameter logistic equation was obtained. Both equations describe the sigmoidal dose-response curve, and the equation selection was based on the Akaike's Information Criteria (33Akaike H. No to Hattatsu. 1992; 24: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar) using the GraphPad 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego). For statistical analyses, the equality and normality of the standard deviations and goodness of curve fit were tested.Nitrocellulose Filter Binding Assays—RNA binding assays were performed identically to RdRp assays in 25 μl of RP buffer omitting the NTP addition. The concentration of HCV NS5B was set to 0.36 μm (600 ng), and mAbs concentrations were between 0.144 and 3.6 μm. After NS5B and mAb, a 10-min incubation at 4 °C, 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled poly(rC)·(rG)12, or HCV subgenomic replicon RNAs were added, and incubation was extended for another 10 min at 4 °C. Then the reactions were supplemented with 75 μl of RP buffer containing 200 ng of respective analogous unlabeled RNA, yielding a 100-μl total reaction volume. Under these conditions ∼10% of the input RNA was bound. After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, samples were filtered through 0.45-μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane filters (BA 85; Schleicher and Schuell), which had been presoaked in RP buffer for 1 h at 25 °C. Membrane filters were washed with 5 ml of RP buffer, and bound radioactivity was then measured by liquid scintillation counting. Background as determined by analogous titrations with NS5B omitted, and analogous titrations with NS5B substituted for bovine serum albumin were subtracted. The nonspecific binding of bovine serum albumin and RNA to the nitrocellulose membrane filters was below 0.1%.ELISA—Indirect ELISAs with proteins and peptides were performed according to Pfaff et al. (34Pfaff E. Mussgay M. Bohm H.O. Schulz G.E. Schaller H. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Direct ELISAs with hybridomas were performed according to Juronen et al. (35Juronen E. Tasa G. Uuskula M. Pooga M. Mikelsaar A.V. Hybridoma. 1996; 15: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation reactions were performed as described by Moradpour and colleagues (36Moradpour D.

Virol. 2005; 79: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10 μg/liter of Na2SeO3. The Huh7 cell lines harboring selectable HCV replicons contained 0.5 mg/ml G418 (PAA). RNA transfection experiments were carried out using electroporation in the GenePulser Xcell apparatus (Bio-Rad). Electroporation of RNA was performed as described previously (25Krieger N. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4614-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 26Lohmann V.

Virol. 2005; 79: 13778-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and capacitance was adjusted to 950 microfarads and voltage to 270 V. In brief, after addition of RNA to a 0.4-cm-wide cuvette (Bio-Rad) containing the 0.4 × 107 cells in 400 μl of cytomix buffer (38van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), the capacitor was discharged exponentially. The cells were immediately suspended, transferred to the DMEM containing 1.25% DMSO, and plated onto 60-mm dishes. After overnight incubation, the medium was changed to DMSO-free.COS7 cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. DNA was transfected into cells using electroporation in 250 μl of cytomix buffer. The capacitance was adjusted to 97 microfarads and voltage to 180 V. After discharging the capacitor, the cells were transferred to a fresh Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and plated onto 100-mm dishes.Transient Replication Assays—Huh7 or Huh7-Lunet cells were transfected by electroporation with HCV subgenomic luciferase replicons at 1.5 μg per each transfection. Cells were harvested at different time points and lysed with a cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, the lysate was mixed with luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and luminescence was measured. The values obtained with cells harvested 4 h post-electroporation were used to determine transfection efficiency. Total protein content in the lysate was measured in Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) for normalization of the replication signals.RESULTSAntibody Production, Characterization, and Epitope Mapping—Recombinant HCV NS5B RdRp was expressed in E. coli and purified to near"
https://openalex.org/W2012703689,"Genes encoding the peptide deformylase enzyme (def) are present in all eubacteria and are involved in the deformylation of the N-formyl group of newly synthesized polypeptides during protein synthesis. We compared the amino acid sequences of this enzyme in different mycobacterial species and found that they are highly conserved (76% homology with 62% identity); however, when this comparison was extended to other eubacterial homologs, it emerged that the mycobacterial proteins have an insertion region containing three consecutive arginine residues (residues 77–79 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis peptide deformylase (mPDF)). Here, we demonstrate that these three arginines are important for the activity of mPDF. Circular dichroism studies of wild-type mPDF and of mPDF containing individual conservative substitutions (R77K, R78K, or R79K) or combined substitutions incorporated into a triple mutant (R77K/R78K/R79K) indicate that such mutations cause mPDF to undergo structural alterations. Molecular modeling of mPDF suggests that the three arginines are distal to the active site. Molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type and mutant mPDF structures indicate that the arginines may be involved in the stabilization of substrate binding pocket residues for their proper interaction with peptide(s).

The first amino acid incorporated during polypeptide biosynthesis in eukaryotes is methionine. On the other hand, in prokaryotes and in eukaryotic organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts), ribosomal protein biosynthesis is initiated with N-formyl-methionyl-tRNA. Thus, all nascent polypeptides in prokaryotes are formylated at their amino termini (1Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meinnel T. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7737-7740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Giglione C. Perrie M. Meinnel T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Since peptidases acting at NH2 termini are unable to utilize formylated NH2 termini as substrates, the removal of the formyl group is mandatory for polypeptide maturation in all cases in which the removal of the NH2-terminal methionine is essential for protein folding or function.

We have earlier cloned, expressed, and characterized the peptide deformylase enzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We found that M. tuberculosis peptide deformylase (mPDF) is an iron-containing protein that is enzymatically active as a multimer (15Saxena R. Chakraborti P.K. Biohem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 16Saxena R. Chakraborti P.K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8216-8220Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+ by environmental oxygen results in inactivation of the PDF of Escherichia coli (17Rajagopalan P.T. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22305-22310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we found mPDF to be stable at 30 °C with a half-life of ∼4 h. Also, preincubation with an oxidizing agent like H2O2 had no significant effect on activity (15Saxena R. Chakraborti P.K. Biohem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of mPDF revealed several features, such as the presence of three conserved motifs (motif I, GXGXAAXQ; motif II, EGCLS; motif III, QHEXXH, in which X represents any hydrophobic residue), one insertion (amino acid residues 74–85) between motifs I and II, and an extended COOH terminus (amino acid residues 182–197). We also showed that the first six amino acids (residues 74–79) of the insertion region mentioned above play a role in stabilizing mPDF and in imbuing it with resistance to oxidizing agents like H2O2 (16Saxena R. Chakraborti P.K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8216-8220Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This finding is difficult to reconcile with the finding (7Li Y. Chen Z. Gong W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that deletion of similar insertions in other bacteria fails to affect enzyme activity. There are three consecutive arginine residues in the insertion region (residues 74–85). Through detailed structure-function analyses, we show here that these three arginines are important for mPDF activity. CD spectroscopic studies of the mutants incorporating conservative substitutions (R77K, R78K, and R79K, individually and as a triple mutant) reveal structural alterations in comparison with wild-type mPDF. Molecular modeling of mPDF based on structural homology with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PDF suggests that these arginines are not in the vicinity of the enzyme active site. Molecular dynamics simulations with wild-type and mutant structures, on the other hand, reveal that these arginines might help in the interaction of substrate with amino acid residues in the substrate binding pocket of mPDF. Thus, all of these lines of evidence indicate the importance of arginines of the insertion region of mPDF for its enzyme activity. Materials—Restriction/modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. ECL Western blotting detection kit, PCR DNA and gel band purification kit, and protein molecular weight markers were from GE Healthcare; the Expand long template PCR system was from Roche Applied Science; Herculase fusion DNA polymerase was from Stratagene; VentR DNA polymerase was from New England Biolabs; and plasmid DNA preparation kits were from Qiagen. All other fine chemicals and reagents, including catalase, N-formyl-Met-Ala, and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, were procured from Sigma. Different media for bacterial culture were obtained from Difco. Oligonucleotides used in this study were custom synthesized (Biobasic/IDT/Ocimum Biosolutions). DNA Manipulation and Generation of mPDF Mutants—Genomic DNA isolated from M. tuberculosis strain H37Ra (18Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was used for PCR amplification and subsequent cloning of the def gene (Rv0429c) in expression vector (pET-mPDF) as described elsewhere (15Saxena R. Chakraborti P.K. Biohem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). PCR-based methods were employed for generation of mutations in mPDF. For each mutation, two external (CR26 and CR27) and two internal (designed incorporating mutation) primers (supplemental Table 1) were used. To generate deletion (ΔMTA/ΔIR) or point mutants (R77K, R77A, R77D, R78K, R78A, R78D, R79K, R79A, and R79D), two sets of primary (pET-mPDF as the template) and one set of secondary (mixture of primary reaction products as the template) PCRs were carried out by the overlap extension method (19Shirley K. Sheng Y.C. John J.S. Alice W. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 143-155Google Scholar) using Herculase fusion DNA polymerase. For the triple mutant, R77K/R78K/R79K, a ∼400-bp megaprimer, was PCR-amplified with one internal (CK32; designed incorporating mutations) and one external primer (CR27) using R79K as the template, following a method described previously elsewhere (20Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene. 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this megaprimer, along with the external primer, CR26, upon PCR amplification using R79K DNA as the template, yielded the triple mutant. PCR products containing desired mutations were digested with SacII/HindIII and incorporated into pET-mPDF. All of these constructs and the wild-type mPDF construct were individually transformed into E. coli strain DH5α to build up the DNA for further processing. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing using an automated DNA sequencer. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The wild-type construct (pET-mPDF) and different mutant constructs were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for overexpression and subsequent purification of NH2-terminally histidine-tagged fusion proteins. Overnight cultures of these clones (∼15 h at 37 °C in LB broth containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin) were reinoculated and grown to an A600 of 0.8. Cells were then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C, harvested after 12 h, suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml catalase, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and sonicated. The pellet fraction obtained through centrifugation (∼12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 3 m urea and 2% Triton X-100. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed (14 h at 4 °C) to remove urea, and the protein was purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column as described earlier (15Saxena R. Chakraborti P.K. Biohem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Finally, mPDF and its different mutants were eluted (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 10 μg/ml catalase). The concentrations of the stock of the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-purified mPDF and its different mutants were maintained at 3.5 mg/ml and stored at –80 °C until used in assays. Unless mentioned otherwise, mPDF and its mutants were diluted (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 μg/ml catalase) prior to use in assays. Enzyme Assay—The ability of mPDF or different mutants to deformylate formyl-Met-Ala was assessed through a spectrophotometric assay, as previously described (15Saxena R. Chakraborti P.K. Biohem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, in a total of 50 μl of reaction volume, wild-type (70 ng) or mutant (280 ng for R77K, R77A, R77D, R78K, R78A, R78D, 1 μg for R79K, R79A, R79D, and 1.6 μg for R77K/R78K/R79K) protein in 1× assay buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 μg/ml catalase) was incubated with the substrate (0–40 mm N-formyl-Met-Ala) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 4% HClO4 and further incubated (30 °C for 2 h) with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid reagent (0.01% in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.4). Following the addition of 10% SDS (250 μl) and 1 m HCl (125 μl), the highly chromogenic derivative generated due to reaction of primary amine with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid was monitored through measurement of the absorption at 335 nm. The values obtained were corrected by subtracting the blank (all ingredients except enzyme) readings. The specific enzyme activity was calculated from standard curves prepared with methionine (0–42.8 nmol) and expressed as nmol of free amino group produced/min/mg of protein. Km and Vmax values were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots, and for calculating kcat values, the molecular mass of recombinant mPDF was taken as 22.6 kDa. Unless mentioned otherwise, data for enzyme activity represent mean ± S.D. of values from three independent experiments. Western Blotting—The recombinant mPDF protein (∼1 mg/ml) was used to raise polyclonal antibody in rabbit (21Sarin J. Aggarwal S. Chaba R. Varshney G.C. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44590-44597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which recognizes native enzymes of M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis. For Western blotting, purified proteins (1 μg of protein/slot) or the soluble fractions of cell lysates (50 μg of protein/slot) were resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm) using a mini-transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to ensure transfer, processed using anti-mPDF or anti-His antibody, and detected through an ECL detection system following the manufacturer's (GE Healthcare) recommended protocol. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded in a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Measurements in the far ultraviolet region (250–187 nm) were performed on protein solutions (0.15–0.3 mg/ml) employing a cell with path length of 0.5 cm at 25 °C. The mean residue ellipticity, [θ], was calculated using a mean residue molecular mass of 110 Da. Each spectrum reported is an average of 10 scans. Blank spectra of aqueous buffer were used to correct the observed spectra. Confocal Microscopy—M. smegmatis culture (∼105 cells/3 ml of 7H9 Middlebrook broth supplemented with a 10% mixture of albumin, dextrose, and catalase) was grown (37 °C/200 rpm) in the presence and absence of different 5′-phosphothiorate-modified antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides for 24 h. Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (100 μl). Following mounting of samples (5–10 μl) on glass slides, fluorescence emitted by cells was visualized on an inverted LSM510 META laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) fitted with a Plan-Apochromat ×100 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. For detection of green fluorescence, the 488 line of an argon ion laser was directed over an HFT UV/488 beam splitter, and fluorescence was detected in multitrack configuration using an NFT 490 beam splitter in combination with a BP 505–530 band pass filter. Images were finally processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5. Bioinformatic Analysis—Nucleotide-derived amino acid sequence of mPDF has been compared with a nonredundant data base using BLAST (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhant J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). The multiple-sequence alignment of the retrieved sequences is carried out using ClustalX (23Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar) with default values for gap opening and extension penalties. Molecular Modeling—The structure of mPDF was predicted by the ROBETTA server (24Chivian D. Kim D.E. Malmstrom L. Bradley P. Robertson T. Murphy P. Strauss C.E. Bonneau R. Rohl C.A. Baker D. Proteins. 2003; 53: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) using the structure of P. aeruginosa PDF (Protein Data Bank code 1N5N) (25Kreusch A. Spraggon G. Lee C.C. Klock H. McMullan D. Ng K. Shin T. Vincent J. Warner I. Ericson C. Lesley S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), since it shows highest sequence homology (38% identity, 49% similarity). Five models of the structure of mPDF were predicted by the server. Superposition of these five structures revealed that the core regions of mPDF are conserved (with an average r.m.s. deviation of 0.3 Å), whereas large deviations were observed at the flexible loops (with average r.m.s. deviation of 6.0 Å). These structures were subjected to energy minimization, and the structure with minimum energy was selected. The convergence criterion used was an r.m.s. gradient of 0.01 Å. The energy-minimized structure of mPDF was stereochemically validated using PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and subsequently used in molecular dynamics studies. The energy minimization and molecular dynamics were carried out using the Sander module of the AMBER9 package (27Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6709) Google Scholar). AMBER FF03 all atom force field (28Duan Y. Wu C. Chowdhury S. Lee M.C. Xiong G. Zhang W. Yang R. Cieplak P. Luo R. Lee T. J. Comput. Chem. 2003; 24: 1999-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (3762) Google Scholar) was used for proteins, ions, and water molecules. Structures for different mutants of mPDF were generated using PYMOL (29DeLano W.L. The PyMOL molecular graphics system. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA1998http://www.pymol.orgGoogle Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on wild-type and mutant (R77K/R78K/R79K) structures. Both proteins were immersed in a truncated octahedron box filled with about 8000 TIP3P water molecules. The expansion and shrinkage of all covalent bonds connecting to a hydrogen atom were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm (30Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C J. Comput. Phy. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (17193) Google Scholar). Periodic boundary conditions were applied to avoid the edge effect in all calculations. The structures of the protein immersed in water were neutralized by the addition of the required amount of counter ions. The energy minimization for this system was achieved in two steps. The solvent and ions were energy-minimized first, keeping the protein fixed with restraint force of 100 kcal/mol/Å2. In the next step, all atoms of solute and solvent were minimized without any restrained energy. In each step, the minimization was executed by 1000 steps of steepest descent and 2000 steps of conjugate gradient methods. The nonbonded interactions were calculated with a 12 Å cut-off. The molecular dynamics simulations were performed on this system at 300 K for 10 ns using an NVT ensemble. A time step of 1 fs was used for integration of Newtonian equations, and the snapshots were saved every 2 ps. Analysis of production run (last 9 ns) of the simulations was done using the ptraj module of AMBER 9. Insertion Region of mPDF Contributes to Peptide Deformylase Activity—The presence of an insertion sequence in PDFs of Gram-positive bacteria is well known (15Saxena R. Chakraborti P.K. Biohem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 25Kreusch A. Spraggon G. Lee C.C. Klock H. McMullan D. Ng K. Shin T. Vincent J. Warner I. Ericson C. Lesley S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mPDF also possesses insertion between motifs I and II (amino acid residues 74–85; denoted as IR in Fig. 1A). Among different mycobacterial species, this region of PDF exhibits ∼84% identity (Fig. 1A). To identify crucial residues in this region, we constructed three deletion mutants (Fig. 1B), expressed them as His-tagged proteins, and examined their activities. The expression of different mutant proteins was confirmed by Western blot using rabbit polyclonal antiserum against recombinant mPDF (Fig. 1C, inset). In an earlier report (16Saxena R. Chakraborti P.K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8216-8220Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we noted that the ΔID mutant (i.e. with residues 74–79 deleted) did not show any activity. Here, we show that the deformylase activity of the ΔMTA mutant (i.e. with only residues 74–76 deleted) is comparable with that of the wild type (Fig. 1C), although deletion of the entire insertion region in the ΔIR mutant (i.e. with residues 74–85 deleted) completely abolishes activity (Fig. 1C). These results establish that the region comprising residues 77–85 in the insertion region is essential for the deformylase activity of mPDF. Three Consecutive Arginines in the Insertion Region Are Important for the mPDF Enzyme Activity—Intriguingly, among the critical residues in the insertion sequence, three consecutive arginines are conserved in the PDF homologs of different mycobacterial species (Fig. 1A). To elucidate the role of these residues, we generated mutants substituting all three arginines with lysine (either individually or together). In comparison with wild-type mPDF, the deformylation ability of all of the mutants was found to be affected (Fig. 2A and Table 1), the effect being most dramatic in the triple mutant in which no activity could be detected, during incubations with increasing concentrations (2.5–40 mm) of substrate (N-formyl-Met-Ala). This was reflected in assays carried out using increasing concentrations of protein (Fig. 2A, inset). The effect was also reflected in the enzyme's turnover rate, since significant decreases in the kcat values were observed (Table 1). Furthermore, as reflected in Km values, mutation of these arginines appears to affect enzyme-substrate affinity (Table 1). The effect of the mutations was not Lys-specific, since substitution of Arg with either Ala or Asp also resulted in significant inhibition in activity compared with wild-type mPDF (Table 1), as would be expected, since nonconservative mutations could be expected to show an effect where conservative mutations also show effects. In subsequent studies, therefore, only arginine-to-lysine (R77K, R78K, R79K) mutants were used.TABLE 1Kinetics of deformylase activity exhibited by mPDF mutantsSampleKmkcatkcat/KmNumber of experimentsmms-1m-1 s-1Wild type4.1 ± 0.25.0 ± 0.31220 ± 63R77K6.9 ± 1.41.8 ± 0.3266 ± 344R77A6.5 ± 1.71.6 ± 0.2252 ± 354R77D9.3 ± 2.50.6 ± 0.267 ± 113R78K5.6 ± 0.91.6 ± 0.3293 ± 473R78A6.4 ± 1.71.7 ± 0.2270 ± 605R78D11.7 ± 2.20.8 ± 0.257 ± 113R79K5.0 ± 0.40.24 ± 0.0252 ± 43R79A3.4 ± 1.00.08 ± 0.0522 ± 63R79DNDaND, not detectable.NDND3R77K/R78K/R79KNDNDND3a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab The influence of the mutations on the enzymatic stability of mPDF was examined by monitoring the activity as a function of time (Fig. 2B). The activity of R77K exhibited a half-life marginally lower than that of wild-type mPDF (3.7 ± 0.5 h as opposed to 4.1 ± 0.7 h). In comparison, a far more significant decrease in half-life with respect to activity was noticed with R78K (2.2 ± 0.3 h) and R79K (half-life = 0.6 ± 0.1 h). To know the contributions of these arginines in conferring resistance to oxidizing agents, we monitored the effect of H2O2 on the activity of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2C, preincubation with H2O2 (500 mm) for 15 min resulted in significant decreases in the deformylase activity of R79K, compared with wild type or R77K or R78K mPDF. Thus, these findings establish the role of three arginines in modulating the activity of mPDF. Three Arginines Contribute to the Tertiary Structure of mPDF—The possibility of any structural alterations having occurred in the mutant proteins (R77K, R78K, R79K, or R77K/R78K/R79K) was explored by examining their far-UV CD spectra between 250 and 187 nm. The far-UV CD spectrum of mPDF shows negative minima at 208 and 222 nm (indicative of a predominantly helical structure); however, the low mean residue ellipticity of about –6000 at 222 nm indicates the presence of other (sheet and coil) structures (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the mutant proteins show significant alterations of secondary structures. In all mutants, there was a reduction in the ellipticity at 222 nm and an increase, as well as a blue shifting, of the 208 nm bands, clearly indicating a relative increase in the content of random coil structures in the proteins (Fig. 3). As expected, random coil structures yielded a negative band at 198 nm, and when their content was increased in relation to other structures within the protein, there was a shifting of negative minima in the range of 200–210 nm to lower wavelengths as well as shifting of the crossover point (i.e. the wavelength at which the spectrum crossed the zero line in the ellipticity plot). To understand why mutations of the arginines (R77K/R78K/R79K) alter the structure of the protein, molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on both wild-type and mutant mPDFs. The three-dimensional structure of mPDF was predicted through homology modeling on the ROBETTA server (24Chivian D. Kim D.E. Malmstrom L. Bradley P. Robertson T. Murphy P. Strauss C.E. Bonneau R. Rohl C.A. Baker D. Proteins. 2003; 53: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and using P. aeruginosa PDF as template (25Kreusch A. Spraggon G. Lee C.C. Klock H. McMullan D. Ng K. Shin T. Vincent J. Warner I. Ericson C. Lesley S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as already mentioned. The modeled structure reveals that all three arginines (residues 77–79) are surface-exposed, and also they are distal to the active site, as shown in Fig. 4. Notably, prediction of disordered regions in this structural model on the SPRITZ server (31Vullo A. Bortolami O. Pollastri G. Tosatto S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W164-W168Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggests that the three arginine residues, Arg77–Arg79, are in an ordered conformation and not in disordered regions. To map the substrate binding pocket of mPDF, the predicted structure was superimposed with E. coli PDF, a bacterial structure (ePDF; Protein Data Bank code 1BS8) (32Becker A. Schlichting I. Kabsch W. Groche D. Schultz S. Wagner A.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that is complexed with a tripeptide (Met-Ala-Ser). Furthermore, it has been shown that the interaction between this peptide and PDFs are similar in Gram-positive as well as in Gram-negative bacteria (25Kreusch A. Spraggon G. Lee C.C. Klock H. McMullan D. Ng K. Shin T. Vincent J. Warner I. Ericson C. Lesley S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Smith K.J. Petit C.M. Aubart K. Smyth M. McManus E. Jones J. Fosberry A. Lewis C. Lonetto M. Christensen S.B. Protein Science. 2003; 12: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The superposition of mPDF with ePDF, as shown in Fig. 4, reveals that most of the amino acid residues (Gly49, Val50, Gly51, Glu104, Gly105, Cys106, Leu107, Arg144, and Met145) of mPDF lining the cavity within 5 Å of the substrate are identical to that of the ePDF. The amino acid positions Val50, Arg144, and Met145 in mPDF are in correspondence with Ile44, Ile128, and Cys1"
https://openalex.org/W2046239077,"Cancers have been revealed to be extremely heterogenous in terms of the frequency and types of mutations present in cells from different malignant tumors. Thus, it is likely that uniform clinical treatment is not optimal for all patients, and that the development of individualized therapeutic regimens may be beneficial. We describe the generation of multiple, unique small peptides nine to thirty-four amino acids in length which, when labeled with the radioisotope 32P, bind with vastly differing efficiencies to cell lines derived from different colon adenocarcinomas. In addition, the most effective of these peptides permanently transfers the 32P radioisotope to colorectal cancer cellular proteins within two hours at a rate that is more than 150 times higher than in cell lines derived from other cancers or from the normal tissues tested. Currently, the only two FDA-approved radioimmunotherapeutic agents in use both employ antibodies directed against the B cell marker CD20 for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. By using the method described herein, large numbers of different 32P-labeled peptides can be readily produced and assayed against a broad spectrum of cancer types. This report proposes the development and use of 32P-labeled peptides as potential individualized peptide-binding therapies for the treatment of colon adenocarcinoma patients."

https://openalex.org/W2106738467,"Genetic association studies are identifying genetic risks for common complex ocular traits such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The subjects used for discovery of these loci have been largely from clinic-based, case-control studies. Typically, only the primary phenotype (e.g., AMD) being studied is systematically documented and other complex traits (e.g., affecting the eye) are largely ignored. The purpose of this study was to characterize these other or secondary complex ocular traits present in the cases and controls of clinic-based studies being used for genetic study of AMD. The records of 100 consecutive new patients (of any diagnosis) age 60 or older for which all traits affecting the eye had been recorded systematically were reviewed. The average patient had 3.5 distinct diagnoses. A subset of 10 complex traits was selected for further study because they were common and could be reliably diagnosed. The density of these 10 complex ocular traits increased by 0.017 log-traits/year (P = 0.03), ranging from a predicted 2.74 at age 60 to 4.45 at age 90. Trait-trait association was observed only between AMD and primary vitreomacular traction (P = 0.0009). Only 1% of subjects age 60 or older had no common complex traits affecting the eye. Extrapolations suggested that a study of 2000 similar subjects would have sufficient power to detect genetic association with an odds ratio of 2.0 or less for 4 of these 10 traits. In conclusion, the high prevalence of complex traits affecting the aging eye and the inherent biases in referral patterns leads to the potential for confounding by undocumented secondary traits within case-control studies. In addition to the primary trait, other common ocular phenotypes should be systematically documented in genetic association studies so that adjustments for potential trait-trait associations and other bias can be made and genetic risk variants identified in secondary analyses."
