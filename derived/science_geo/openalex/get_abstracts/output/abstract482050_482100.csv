https://openalex.org/W1983770566,"Cells with sphere forming capacity, spheroid cells, are present in the malignant ascites of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and represent a significant impediment to efficacious treatment due to their putative role in progression, metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. The exact mechanisms that underlie EOC metastasis and drug resistance are not clear. Understanding the biology of sphere forming cells may contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic opportunities for metastatic EOC. Here we generated spheroid cells from human ovarian cancer cell lines and primary ovarian cancer. Xenoengraftment of as few as 2000 dissociated spheroid cells into immune-deficient mice allowed full recapitulation of the original tumor, whereas >10(5) parent tumor cells remained non-tumorigenic. The spheroid cells were found to be enriched for cells with cancer stem cell-like characteristics such as upregulation of stem cell genes, self-renewal, high proliferative and differentiation potential, and high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. Furthermore, spheroid cells were more aggressive in growth, migration, invasion, scratch recovery, clonogenic survival, anchorage-independent growth, and more resistant to chemotherapy in vitro. (13)C-glucose metabolic studies revealed that spheroid cells route glucose predominantly to anaerobic glycolysis and pentose cycle to the detriment of re-routing glucose for anabolic purposes. These metabolic properties of sphere forming cells appear to confer increased resistance to apoptosis and contribute to more aggressive tumor growth. Collectively, we demonstrated that spheroid cells with cancer stem cell-like characteristics contributed to tumor generation, progression and chemotherapy resistance. This study provides insight into the relationship between tumor dissemination and metabolic attributes of human cancer stem cells and has clinical implications for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1993833941,"Structural plasticity in the adult brain is essential for adaptive behavior. We have found a remarkable anatomical plasticity in the basal ganglia of adult mice that is regulated by dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs). By modulating neuronal excitability, striatal D2Rs bidirectionally control the density of direct pathway collaterals in the globus pallidus that bridge the direct pathway with the functionally opposing indirect pathway. An increase in bridging collaterals is associated with enhanced inhibition of pallidal neurons in vivo and disrupted locomotor activation after optogenetic stimulation of the direct pathway. Chronic blockade with haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia, decreases the extent of bridging collaterals and rescues the locomotor imbalance. These findings identify a role for bridging collaterals in regulating the concerted balance of striatal output and may have important implications for understanding schizophrenia, a disease involving excessive activation of striatal D2Rs that is treated with D2R blockers."

Using these reporters in combination with different Cre drivers, we have defined the topographies of XCI mosaicism for multiple CNS cell types and of retinal vascular dysfunction in a model of Norrie disease. Depending on cell type, fluctuations in the XCI mosaic are observed over a wide range of spatial scales, from neighboring cells to left versus right sides of the body.

These data imply a major role for XCI in generating female-specific, genetically directed, stochastic diversity in eutherian mammals on spatial scales that would be predicted to affect CNS function within and between individuals. For animals such as dipteran insects, birds, and mammals, in which males and females possess distinct complements of sex chromosomes, a mechanism is needed to normalize the relative levels of gene expression from the autosomes, present at two copies per somatic cell, and the shared sex chromosome, present at either one or two copies. In female mammals, this normalization is achieved by epigenetic silencing of most of the genes on one of the two X chromosomes, a process referred to as X chromosome inactivation (XCI). The discovery of XCI followed from the observation that female eutherian mammals show somatic mosaicism for traits such as coat color and that the nuclei of female somatic cells possess a condensed chromatin structure, the Barr body (Lyon, 1962Lyon M.F. Sex chromatin and gene action in the mammalian X-chromosome.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1962; 14: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar). XCI is initiated early in embryogenesis and is complete by approximately embryonic day (E) 6.5 in the mouse (with some variation among tissues; Tan et al., 1993Tan S.S. Williams E.A. Tam P.P.

For XCI in embryonic tissues, the choice between maternal and paternal X chromosomes appears to be random, but in extraembryonic tissues the paternal X chromosome is selectively inactivated (Takagi and Sasaki, 1975Takagi N.

Since its discovery, XCI has served as a paradigm for epigenetic regulation (Lee, 2011Lee J.T. Gracefully ageing at 50, X-chromosome inactivation becomes a paradigm for RNA and chromatin control.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The intrachromosomal spreading of inactivation is controlled by a large noncoding RNA, Xist, which is transcribed from and associates in cis with the inactive X chromosome. The inactive chromosome is characterized by increased DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications. In the context of human genetic disease, the implications of XCI for heterozygous females have long been recognized (reviewed in Willard, 2001Willard H.F. The sex chromosomes and X chromosome inactivation.in: Scriver C.R. Baudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. Eighth Edition. McGraw Hill, New York2001: 1191-1211Google Scholar). In the context of neurologic disease, the effects of XCI vary with disease (Dobyns et al., 2004Dobyns W.B. Filauro A. Tomson B.N. Chan A.S. Ho A.W. Ting N.T. Oosterwijk J.C. Ober C. Inheritance of most X-linked traits is not dominant or recessive, just X-linked.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2004; 129A: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For example, carriers of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) deficiency (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) are usually unaffected (Jinnah and Friedmann, 2001Jinnah H.A. Friedmann T. Lesch-Nyhan disease and its variants.in: Scriver C.R. Baudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. Eighth Edition. McGraw Hill, New York2001: 2537-2570Google Scholar). By contrast, carriers of MECP2 deficiency (Rett syndrome) invariably exhibit serious neurologic symptoms (Chahrour and Zoghbi, 2007Chahrour M. Zoghbi H.Y. The story of Rett syndrome: from clinic to neurobiology.Neuron. 2007; 56: 422-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). XCI also has the potential to create cellular diversity that is advantageous. Among New World primates, polymorphic variation within a single X-linked visual pigment gene confers trichromatic color vision on females heterozygous for alleles that encode pigments with different spectral sensitivities, whereas homozygous females and hemizygous males have dichromatic color vision (Jacobs, 1998Jacobs G.H. A perspective on color vision in platyrrhine monkeys.Vision Res. 1998; 38: 3307-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similarly, female mice genetically engineered to carry a pair of X-linked visual pigment alleles coding for spectrally distinct pigments acquire an added dimension of chromatic discrimination (Jacobs et al., 2007Jacobs G.H. Williams G.A. Cahill H. Nathans J. Emergence of novel color vision in mice engineered to express a human cone photopigment.Science. 2007; 315: 1723-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These observations emphasize the importance of knowing the spatial- and cell-type-specific patterns of XCI, most especially in the nervous system where cell location, type, and function are tightly controlled. They also emphasize the importance of knowing which genes obey, escape, or are quantitatively influenced by XCI. The present study addresses these questions with the use of mice that have been genetically engineered to visualize XCI in defined cell types at single-cell resolution. Previous work with gene-targeted mice has shown that reporters inserted at the X-linked Hprt locus obey XCI (Ciavatta et al., 2006Ciavatta D. Kalantry S. Magnuson T. Smithies O. A DNA insulator prevents repression of a targeted X-linked transgene but not its random or imprinted X inactivation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 9958-9963Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To construct a dual color system for visualizing XCI, we modified an Hprt targeting vector in which tandem insulators flank a central reporter cassette, and we detected the desired gene targeting event by the restoration of Hprt activity in embryonic stem cells that carry a partial deletion of the Hprt gene (Ciavatta et al., 2006Ciavatta D. Kalantry S. Magnuson T. Smithies O. A DNA insulator prevents repression of a targeted X-linked transgene but not its random or imprinted X inactivation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 9958-9963Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2009Yang G.S. Banks K.G. Bonaguro R.J. Wilson G. Dreolini L. de Leeuw C.N. Liu L. Swanson D.J. Goldowitz D. Holt R.A. Simpson E.M. Next generation tools for high-throughput promoter and expression analysis employing single-copy knock-ins at the Hprt1 locus.Genomics. 2009; 93: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1A, the XCI reporters consist of a CMV/beta-actin enhancer/promoter, a LoxP-transcription stop-LoxP (LSL) cassette, and coding sequences for a nuclear-localized fluorescent protein, either GFP or tdTomato (HprtLSL-GFP and HprtLSL-tdT). Combining the two reporters in a heterozygous female together with a cell-type-specific Cre transgene or knockin allele marks the pattern of XCI in the cell type of interest. We note that this Cre-activated dual color XCI system only works in somatic tissues if the Cre transgene or knockin allele is not expressed in the germline, because each parent of the female test mouse must contribute one of the two Hprt reporters. As summarized in Table S1, this requirement was met by most but not all of the 25 cell-type-specific Cre lines tested. Excision of the LSL cassette with a germline Cre recombinase generates the constitutively active alleles HprtGFP and HprttdT. A survey of various embryonic, neonatal, and adult tissues from HprtGFP/tdT females provides an overview of the topography of XCI mosaicism (Figures 1B–1R; except where indicated otherwise, the images in Figure 1 are of HprtGFP/tdT females). The paternal X chromosome is mostly inactivated in extraembryonic tissue (Figure 1B), as is well established (Takagi and Sasaki, 1975Takagi N. Sasaki M. Preferential inactivation of the paternally derived X chromosome in the extraembryonic membranes of the mouse.Nature. 1975; 256: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, West et al., 1977West J.D.

Preferential expression of the maternally derived X chromosome in the mouse yolk sac.Cell. 1977; 12: 873-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and at E7.5 and E8.5 embryonic cells show finely mixed XCI mosaics (Figures 1B and 1C). At E9.5, there is clear somite-to-somite heterogeneity in the relative abundances of GFP+ (green, G) and tdT+ (red, R) cells, characterized hereafter as the [R/(R + G)] ratio (Figure 1D). The postnatal day (P)2 retina shows radially oriented zones of a single color spanning the full thickness of the retina, in keeping with previous studies of XCI and lineage tracing in the retina (Figure 1E; Fekete et al., 1994Fekete D.M. Perez-Miguelsanz J. Ryder E.F. Cepko C.L. Clonal analysis in the chicken retina reveals tangential dispersion of clonally related cells.Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 666-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Reese et al., 1999Reese B.E. Necessary B.D. Tam P.P. Faulkner-Jones B. Tan S.S. Clonal expansion and cell dispersion in the developing mouse retina.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2965-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Using Pv-Cre and K14-Cre, the XCI mosaic can be selectively visualized in adult cerebellar Purkinje neurons (Figure 1F) and in skin and hair follicles (Figure 1G), respectively. In the skin and cornea, contiguous patches of keratinocytes and endothelial cells express the same XCI reporter (Figures 1H and 1I). In the most superficial layers of the epidermis, where keratinocytes undergo programmed cell death, there is a loss of nuclear localization of the reporters. Many intestinal villi exhibit vertical stripes of GFP+ and tdT+ cells, reflecting the upward migration of clonal epithelial cells from the site of stem cell proliferation at the base of the crypts (Figure 1J). Skeletal muscle fibers, visualized using an Mlc-Cre transgene, show a range of colors intermediate between green and red, which presumably reflects the ratio of GFP+ to tdT+ myoblasts that fused to form each myotube, as seen in the flat-mounted diaphragm (Figure 1K). In the tongue musculature, a marked difference in color across the midline likely reflects the contributions of different ratios of GFP+:tdT+ progenitors from the left and right sides of the embryo (Figures 1L and 1M). In contrast to skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle (Figures 1N and 1O) and smooth muscle (Figure 1P) do not form by cell fusion and therefore do not exhibit colors intermediate between green and red. In cartilage, clusters of cells expressing the same XCI reporter show little intermingling, presumably due to the limited mobility of clonally derived progeny in the cartilage micro-environment (Figure 1Q). A flat-mount view of the organ of Corti shows fine-grained intermingling of GFP+ and tdT+ auditory hair cells and nonsensory epithelial cells (Figure 1R). In all adult tissues examined other than skeletal muscle, labeled nuclei were either GFP+ or tdT+, and none contained a mixture of the two reporters, consistent with the mutually exclusive nature of XCI. Images from HprtGFP/tdT females costained with DAPI reveal either GFP or tdT accumulation in every nucleus (data not shown), indicating that these knockin reporters are not subject to variegation. Therefore, the fidelity of reporter expression is limited only by the fidelity of Cre expression. This is in contrast to some transgenes and reporters (Ramírez et al., 2001Ramírez A. Milot E. Ponsa I. Marcos-Gutiérrez C. Page A. Santos M. Jorcano J. Vidal M. Sequence and chromosomal context effects on variegated expression of keratin 5/lacZ constructs in stratified epithelia of transgenic mice.Genetics. 2001; 158: 341-350PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the observed XCI variation within tissues, the overall [R/(R + G)] ratio varies widely between individuals, including littermates (Figures 1S and 1T). Interindividual XCI variation in the mouse is referable—at least in part—to allelic variation in the X chromosome controlling element (Xce) as well as other X-linked loci (Cattanach, 1975Cattanach B.M. Control of chromosome inactivation.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1975; 9: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, Thorvaldsen et al., 2012Thorvaldsen J.L. Krapp C. Willard H.F. Bartolomei M.S. Nonrandom X chromosome inactivation is influenced by multiple regions on the murine X chromosome.Genetics. 2012; 192: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the next several sections, we analyze local, global, and interindividual differences in the topography of XCI mosaicism for a series of cell types within the CNS. As noted in the Introduction, the topography of XCI mosaicism among cone photoreceptors is of special interest. Using a cone photoreceptor-specific Cre transgene, we studied this topography in the adult retina (Figure 2). X-Y location and GFP+ versus tdT+ identity was determined for each cone in four 640 um × 640 um territories in both retinas from 11 Cone-Cre;HprtLSL-GFP/LSL-tdT mice (4 × 2 × 11 = 88 territories; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). A total of 521,161 cones were included in this analysis. By visual inspection, the cone XCI mosaic exhibits substantial inhomogeneity on a spatial scale of tens to hundreds of microns (Figure 2A). The fraction of red cones, [R/(R + G)], within each imaged territory ranged from 0.15 to 0.8, and within a single retina, the [R/(R + G)] ratios for different territories varied by as much as 0.5 (Figure 2B). Similar degrees of spatial inhomogeneity were observed in the XCI mosaics of several classes of amacrine cells and one class of retinal ganglion cells (Figure S1). Two methods—referred to as “the square method” and “the circle method”—were used to quantify the magnitude and spatial scale of XCI inhomogeneity by assessing [R/(R + G)] ratios at different scales (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In the square method, each of the 88 territories was subdivided into grids of decreasing size and the [R/(R + G)] ratio was calculated for each subdivision (Figures 2C–2E). In the circle method (Rodieck, 1991Rodieck R.W. The density recovery profile: a method for the analysis of points in the plane applicable to retinal studies.Vis. Neurosci. 1991; 6: 95-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the [R/(R + G)] ratio was determined for cones located within a series of concentric annuli centered on each cone (Figure 2F). Control distributions for both methods were constructed by randomly permuting the GFP+ and tdT+ identities within each image. Using the square method, Figure 2C shows histograms of [R/(R + G)] ratios for each of a series of progressively smaller subdivisions. The resulting probability density functions show that the inhomogeneity of the experimental data is greater than that of the randomly permuted data at every spatial scale. This differential was quantified by comparing the variances of the experimental and randomly permuted data for each of the 20 subdivision scales tested (including no subdivisions). As expected, the variances progressively increase with decreasing size of the subdivisions, but at every spatial scale the variance of the experimental data is greater than that of the randomly permuted data (Figures 2D and 2E). The circle method confirms the broad spatial scale of XCI inhomogeneity and further shows that within a Voronoi distance of ∼5 cone territories (∼30 um) the [R/(R + G)] ratio rapidly asymptotes toward the territory’s mean ratio and between Voronoi distances of ∼5 and ∼25 cone territories (∼30 um to ∼150 um) there is a slower approach to the mean (Figure 2F). Of note, there is substantial variation between territories in the rate at which the [R/(R + G)] ratio asymptotes. Spatial inhomogeneity in the adult XCI mosaic is governed by two factors: (1) the ratio of founder cells to adult cells (i.e., the number of cell divisions required to produce the adult structure), and (2) cell migration and intermixing during development. (Cell death is neglected for this analysis.) The retinal cone mosaic presents an especially attractive system for exploring these factors because the mosaic is confined to two dimensions and the number of cells that were scored is very large. Using the data set described above, a series of simulations were carried out for each of the 88 territories imaged. For these simulations, we systematically varied the number of progenitors (12 conditions) and the extent of cell migration (19 conditions) for a total of 12 × 19 = 228 conditions, and ran each condition 400 times (Figures 2H and 2I). The simulated XCI mosaics were analyzed using the circle method, and we then compared the simulated and experimental values of the circle method parameters D and X0 that define the spatial scale of XCI inhomogeneity (Figures 2G and 2J). Within a plane defined by D and X0, the 88 experimental data points sweep out a broad arc (black dots in J), and when compared to the simulated data the mean of the experimental data is centered at approximately six cell divisions and at a migration parameter of ∼1.0, roughly the geometric midpoint of the range tested. However, the most striking aspect of this comparison is the large range of parameter values required to optimally fit all 88 experimental data points. Like the retina, the simple geometry and biological importance of the organ of Corti (OC) recommends it as a tissue in which to study the topography of XCI mosaicism. Using Calb2-Cre;HprtLSL-GFP/LSL-tdT mice, in which reporter expression is activated in auditory hair cells, we analyzed 44 flat mounted P5 OCs, of which 42 represent paired left and right samples (Figures 3A and S2). From these images, 99,507 hair cells were scored for R versus G identity, X-Y position, and position within each of four rows (inner hair cell [IHC], outer hair cell row 1 [OHC-1], OHC-2, or OHC-3; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Substantial variation is observed in the [R/(R + G)] ratio for individual OCs, ranging from 0.1 to 0.9, with a mean ± SD of 0.45 ± 0.16 (Figures 3E and 3F). Approximately 70% of this [R/(R + G)] variation arises from interindividual differences in XCI mosaicism and ∼30% reflects differences between left and right OCs within individuals (Figure 3F). Using a one-dimensional analog of the two-dimensional circle method described above (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we observe almost no correlation in R versus G identities between neighboring cells along each of the four rows of hair cells (Figure 3B). The R versus G correlation is also extremely low between nearest-neighbor cell pairs in adjacent rows of OHCs and is essentially zero between IHCs and OHCs (Figure 3C). These observations imply very thorough intermixing of nearby cells during development of the sensory epithelium. Intermixing appears to be less effective on a large scale, as changes in [R/(R + G)] ratio are apparent along the length of several OCs (Figures 3A, S2D, S2G, and S2H). To quantify this phenomenon, the ordered list of hair cells comprising each hair cell row in the 44 OCs was divided into tenths and the difference in [R/(R + G)] values was calculated for all pairs of subdivisions within each row. The mean of the absolute value of these differences is plotted in Figure 3D, which shows that, on average, there is a progressive decorrelation of [R/(R + G)] ratio with greater distance along the OC. These data are consistent with a model in which variation in the topography of XCI mosaicism along the OC reflects statistical fluctuations in a relatively small population of progenitors. The developing cerebral cortex exhibits two distinct patterns of neurogenesis. Excitatory neurons (pyramidal cells) are generated in the ventricular zone and migrate radially into the immediately overlying cortex (Parnavelas, 2000Parnavelas J.G. The origin and migration of cortical neurones: new vistas.Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 126-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). By contrast, inhibitory interneurons are generated in the ganglionic eminences and undergo long-range tangential migrations to populate the entire cortex (Wonders and Anderson, 2006Wonders C.P. Anderson S.A. The origin and specification of cortical interneurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Here, we ask how these proliferation and migration patterns affect the XCI mosaics for different types of cortical neurons. Because the cortical column, the fundamental unit of cortical information processing, encompasses a region of several hundred microns in diameter, there is a special interest in comparing this spatial scale to that of XCI mosaicism. In the adult brain, excitatory neurons were visualized with Camk2-Cre;HprtLSL-GFP/LSL-tdT mice (Figure 4A), and inhibitory GABAergic interneurons with Gad2-Cre;HprtLSL-GFP/LSL-tdT mice. Additionally, a subpopulation of excitatory neurons—layer 4/5 cortical pyramidal cells—was visualized with a Rbp4-Cre driver, and three subpopulations of inhibitory interneurons were visualized with Pv-Cre, Sst-Cre, and Vip-Cre drivers (Figure 4A). For each genotype, six to nine 1 mm × 3 mm images were obtained from sagittal sections of cortex (Figure 4B) and GFP+ and tdT+ cells were scored manually (Figure 4A, central panels). Following the logic of the square method, each cortical image was divided into a series of stripes as shown in Figure 4B and the [R/(R + G)] ratio was determined for each stripe (Figure 4C). As a control, 1,000 random permutations of R versus G identities were performed for each image. By visual inspection, each of the labeled neuronal populations shows substantial intermingling of GFP+ and tdT+ cells. However, a comparison of the variances of the experimental and permuted data reveals a striking difference between pyramidal and interneuron populations (Figure 4D). For pyramidal neurons, the mean variance of the experimental data is ∼10-fold (Rbp4-expressing neurons) or ∼100-fold (Camk2-expressing neurons) larger than the mean variance of the permuted controls, and this difference in variances is apparent on all spatial scales examined. The largest spatial scales (e.g., dividing the 1 mm × 3 mm image into 2, 4, 8, or 16 stripes) encompass the scale of cortical columns (in the mouse barrel cortex, individual barrels have diameters of 150–300 um; Jan et al., 2008Jan T.A. Lu L. Li C.X. Williams R.W. Waters R.S. Genetic analysis of posterior medial barrel subfield (PMBSF) size in somatosensory cortex (SI) in recombinant inbred strains of mice.BMC Neurosci. 2008; 9: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity of XCI mosaicism most likely reflects the coarse-grained division of the neural tube into zones of clonally related progenitors (described below) and the limited tangential migration of pyramidal neurons from their origin in the ventricular zone (Tan et al., 1998Tan S.S. Kalloniatis M. Sturm K. Tam P.P. Reese B.E. Faulkner-Jones B. Separate progenitors for radial and tangential cell dispersion during development of the cerebral neocortex.Neuron. 1998; 21: 295-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). By contrast, all four interneuron types show roughly the same mean variances for experimental and randomly permuted data (Figure 4D). Apparently, interneurons become finely intermixed during proliferation in the ganglionic eminences and/or during tangential migration across the cortex. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) invade the developing neural tube beginning at ∼E9.5 (Stenman et al., 2008Stenman J.M. Rajagopal J. Carroll T.J. Ishibashi M. McMahon J. McMahon A.P. Canonical Wnt signaling regulates organ-specific assembly and differentiation of CNS vasculature.Science. 2008; 322: 1247-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and they spread radially across the developing retina from the optic disc beginning at ∼P0 (Fruttiger, 2007Fruttiger M. Development of the retinal vasculature.Angiogenesis. 2007; 10: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In both tissues, relatively small numbers of ECs invade their targets and then proliferate in situ, an angiogenic sequence that should favor spatial inhomogeneity in the vascular XCI mosaic. Countering the propensity toward local clonality is the high mobility of developing ECs (Jakobsson et al., 2010Jakobsson L. Franco C.A. Bentley K. Collins R.T. Ponsioen B. Aspalter I.M. Rosewell I. Busse M. Thurston G. Medvinsky A. et al.Endothelial cells dynamically compete for the tip cell position during angiogenic sprouting.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). To visualize the XCI mosaic among vascular ECs, we examined brain sections and retina flatmounts in Tie2-Cre;HprtLSL-GFP/LSL-tdT mice. In a set of eight P2 retinas, the [R/(R + G)] ratio for the entire vascular plexus ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 (Figures 5A and 5E ). In P5, P15, and adult retinas, the [R/(R + G)] ratio for single radial arteries and veins generally clustered within ±0.2 of the mean for an individual retina, and across the population surveyed, these ratios varied from <0.1 to ∼0.9 (Figures 5B and 5F). Capillaries within the outer plexiform layer (OPL) showed substantial region-to-region variation in [R/(R + G)] ratio as seen in comparing Figures 5C and 5D. In each of four adult brains, we counted GFP+ and tdT+ ECs in four territories within coronal sections of the cerebral cortex, two in each hemisphere, with ∼8,000 ECs per territory (data not shown). One brain showed minimal variability, with the four [R/(R + G)] ratios clustered near the mean of 0.7. By contrast, the [R/(R + G)] ratios in the three other brains varied over a range of ∼0.5 for each brain. These data suggest that X-linked variation that produces a cell autonomous EC phenotype could generate region-to-region variability in heterozygous females. Correlating XCI mosaicism with cellular and/or physiological defects in mouse models of X-linked disease can reveal determinants of clinical phenotype in female carriers, as demonstrated here for Norrie disease, an X-linked disorder in which mutations in NDP, the gene coding for a glial-derived ligand (Norrin), lead to defects in retinal vascular proliferation, tissue invasion, and barrier formation (for review, see Berger and Ropers, 2001Berger W.

https://openalex.org/W2016355218,"Ischemic stroke results in disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), edema formation and neuronal cell loss. Some neuroprotective factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) favor edema formation, while others such as erythropoietin (Epo) can mitigate it. Both factors are controlled by hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIF) and the activity of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD). We hypothesize that activation of the adaptive hypoxic response by inhibition of PHD results in neuroprotection and prevention of vascular leakage. Mice, subjected to cerebral ischemia, were pre- or post-treated with the novel PHD inhibitor FG-4497. Inhibition of PHD activity resulted in HIF-1α stabilization, increased expression of VEGF and Epo, improved outcome from ischemic stroke and reduced edema formation by maintaining BBB integrity. Additional in vitro studies using brain endothelial cells and primary astrocytes confirmed that FG-4497 induces the HIF signaling pathway, leading to increased VEGF and Epo expression. In an in vitro ischemia model, using combined oxygen and glucose deprivation, FG-4497 promoted the survival of neurons. Furthermore, FG-4497 prevented the ischemia-induced rearrangement and gap formation of the tight junction proteins zonula occludens 1 and occludin, both in cultured endothelial cells and in infarcted brain tissue in vivo. These results indicate that FG-4497 has the potential to prevent cerebral ischemic damage by neuroprotection and prevention of vascular leakage."
https://openalex.org/W2042704577,"System level understanding of the cell requires detailed description of the cell state, which is often characterized by the expression levels of proteins. However, understanding the cell state requires comprehensive information of the cell, which is usually obtained from a large number of cells and their disruption. In this study, we used Raman spectroscopy, which can report changes in the cell state without introducing any label, as a non-invasive method with single cell capability. Significant differences in Raman spectra were observed at the levels of both the cytosol and nucleus in different cell-lines from mouse, indicating that Raman spectra reflect differences in the cell state. Difference in cell state was observed before and after the induction of differentiation in neuroblastoma and adipocytes, showing that Raman spectra can detect subtle changes in the cell state. Cell state transitions during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation were visualized when Raman spectroscopy was coupled with principal component analysis (PCA), which showed gradual transition in the cell states during differentiation. Detailed analysis showed that the diversity between cells are large in undifferentiated ESC and in mesenchymal stem cells compared with terminally differentiated cells, implying that the cell state in stem cells stochastically fluctuates during the self-renewal process. The present study strongly indicates that Raman spectral morphology, in combination with PCA, can be used to establish cells' fingerprints, which can be useful for distinguishing and identifying different cellular states."
https://openalex.org/W2128210247,"Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is rising in middle income countries. Population based strategies to reduce specific CHD risk factors have an important role to play in reducing overall CHD mortality. Reducing dietary salt consumption is a potentially cost-effective way to reduce CHD events. This paper presents an economic evaluation of population based salt reduction policies in Tunisia, Syria, Palestine and Turkey.Three policies to reduce dietary salt intake were evaluated: a health promotion campaign, labelling of food packaging and mandatory reformulation of salt content in processed food. These were evaluated separately and in combination. Estimates of the effectiveness of salt reduction on blood pressure were based on a literature review. The reduction in mortality was estimated using the IMPACT CHD model specific to that country. Cumulative population health effects were quantified as life years gained (LYG) over a 10 year time frame. The costs of each policy were estimated using evidence from comparable policies and expert opinion including public sector costs and costs to the food industry. Health care costs associated with CHDs were estimated using standardized unit costs. The total cost of implementing each policy was compared against the current baseline (no policy). All costs were calculated using 2010 PPP exchange rates. In all four countries most policies were cost saving compared with the baseline. The combination of all three policies (reducing salt consumption by 30%) resulted in estimated cost savings of $235,000,000 and 6455 LYG in Tunisia; $39,000,000 and 31674 LYG in Syria; $6,000,000 and 2682 LYG in Palestine and $1,3000,000,000 and 378439 LYG in Turkey.Decreasing dietary salt intake will reduce coronary heart disease deaths in the four countries. A comprehensive strategy of health education and food industry actions to label and reduce salt content would save both money and lives."
https://openalex.org/W2031113865,"Background Many genome-wide association studies pointed out that SLC2A9 gene, which encodes a voltage-driven urate transporter, SLC2A9/GLUT9 (a.k.a. URATv1), as one of the most influential genes for serum urate levels. SLC2A9 is reported to encode two splice variants: SLC2A9-S (512 amino acids) and SLC2A9-L (540 amino acids), only difference being at their N-termini. We investigated isoform-specific localization of SLC2A9 in the human kidney and role of N-terminal amino acids in differential sorting in vitro. Methodology/Principal Findings Isoform specific antibodies against SLC2A9 were developed and human kidney sections were stained. SLC2A9-S was expressed in the apical side of the collecting duct while SLC2A9-L was expressed in the basolateral side of the proximal tubule. GFP fused SLC2A9s were expressed in MDCK cells and intracellular localization was observed. SLC2A9-S was expressed at both apical and basolateral membranes, whereas SLC2A9-L was expressed only at the basolateral membrane. Although SLC2A9-L has a putative di-leucine motif at 33th and 34th leucine, deletion of the motif or replacement of leucine did not affect its subcellular localization. When up to 16 amino acids were removed from the N-terminal of SLC2A9-S or when up to 25 amino acids were removed from the N-terminal of SLC2A9-L, there was no change in their sorting. Deletion of 20 amino acids from SLC2A9-S was not expressed in the cell. More than 30 amino acids deletion from SLC2A9-L resulted in expression at both apical and basolateral membranes as well as in the lysosome. When amino acids from 25th and 30th were changed to alanine in SLC2A9-L, expression pattern was the same as wild-type. Conclusions/Significance SLC2A9-L was expressed in the basolateral membrane of kidney proximal tubules in humans and this isoform is likely to responsible for urate reabsorption. N-terminal amino acids unique to each isoform played an important role in protein stability and trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2087513367,"Telomerase is required for the unlimited lifespan of cancer cells. The vast majority of pancreatic adenocarcinomas overexpress telomerase activity and blocking telomerase could limit their lifespan. GRN163L (Imetelstat) is a lipid-conjugated N3′→P5′ thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide that blocks the template region of telomerase. The aim of this study was to define the effects of long-term GRN163L exposure on the maintenance of telomeres and lifespan of pancreatic cancer cells. Telomere size, telomerase activity, and telomerase inhibition response to GRN163L were measured in a panel of 10 pancreatic cancer cell lines. The cell lines exhibited large differences in levels of telomerase activity (46-fold variation), but most lines had very short telomeres (2–3 kb in size). GRN163L inhibited telomerase in all 10 pancreatic cancer cell lines, with IC50 ranging from 50 nM to 200 nM. Continuous GRN163L exposure of CAPAN1 (IC50 = 75 nM) and CD18 cells (IC50 = 204 nM) resulted in an initial rapid shortening of the telomeres followed by the maintenance of extremely short but stable telomeres. Continuous exposure to the drug eventually led to crisis and to a complete loss of viability after 47 (CAPAN1) and 69 (CD18) doublings. Crisis In these cells was accompanied by activation of a DNA damage response (γ-H2AX) and evidence of both senescence (SA-β-galactosidase activity) and apoptosis (sub-G1 DNA content, PARP cleavage). Removal of the drug after long-term GRN163L exposure led to a reactivation of telomerase and re-elongation of telomeres in the third week of cultivation without GRN163L. These findings show that the lifespan of pancreatic cancer cells can be limited by continuous telomerase inhibition. These results should facilitate the design of future clinical trials of GRN163L in patients with pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2030600198,"Inhibitory microcircuits are wired with a precision that underlies their complex regulatory roles in neural information processing. In the spinal cord, one specialized class of GABAergic interneurons (GABApre) mediates presynaptic inhibitory control of sensory-motor synapses. The synaptic targeting of these GABAergic neurons exhibits an absolute dependence on proprioceptive sensory terminals, yet the molecular underpinnings of this specialized axoaxonic organization remain unclear. Here, we show that sensory expression of an NB2 (Contactin5)/Caspr4 coreceptor complex, together with spinal interneuron expression of NrCAM/CHL1, directs the high-density accumulation of GABAergic boutons on sensory terminals. Moreover, genetic elimination of NB2 results in a disproportionate stripping of inhibitory boutons from high-density GABApre-sensory synapses, suggesting that the preterminal axons of GABApre neurons compete for access to individual sensory terminals. Our findings define a recognition complex that contributes to the assembly and organization of a specialized GABAergic microcircuit."
https://openalex.org/W2068318767,"The notion that already existing memories can be modified after their reactivation has received an increasing amount of experimental support, with empirical data accumulating across species and memory paradigms. However, there is no evidence for systems-level task-free intrinsic signatures of memory modification. Here, using a combination of behavioral, brain stimulation, and neuroimaging paradigms, we report that noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation interference with a reactivated motor memory altered offline task-free corticostriatal interregional functional connectivity, reducing it compared to stimulation in which the reactivated memory was intact. Furthermore, the modulated functional connectivity predicted offline memory modification. This reduction in functional connectivity recovered after additional execution of the memorized task, and the interference did not affect control cerebellar-cortical functional connectivity. This demonstrates that intrinsic task-free offline brain activity can be modulated by noninvasive interaction with existing memories and strongly correlates with behavioral measurements of changes in memory strength."
https://openalex.org/W2083708774,"The blood meal of the female malaria mosquito is a pre-requisite to egg production and also represents the transmission route for the malaria parasite. The proper and rapid assimilation of proteins and nutrients in the blood meal creates a significant metabolic challenge for the mosquito. To better understand this process we generated a global profile of metabolite changes in response to blood meal of Anopheles gambiae, using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). To disrupt a key pathway of amino acid metabolism we silenced the gene phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) involved in the conversion of the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. We observed increased levels of phenylalanine and the potentially toxic metabolites phenylpyruvate and phenyllactate as well as a reduction in the amount of tyrosine available for melanin synthesis. This in turn resulted in a significant impairment of the melanotic encapsulation response against the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. Furthermore silencing of PAH resulted in a significant impairment of mosquito fertility associated with reduction of laid eggs, retarded vitellogenesis and impaired melanisation of the chorion. Carbidopa, an inhibitor of the downstream enzyme DOPA decarboxylase that coverts DOPA into dopamine, produced similar effects on egg melanization and hatching rate suggesting that egg chorion maturation is mainly regulated via dopamine. This study sheds new light on the role of amino acid metabolism in regulating reproduction and immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2067473404,"Protein Tyrosin Kinase 7 (PTK7) is upregulated in several human cancers; however, its clinical implication in breast cancer (BC) and lymph node (LN) is still unclear. In order to investigate the function of PTK7 in mediating BC cell motility and invasivity, PTK7 expression in BC cell lines was determined. PTK7 signaling in highly invasive breast cancer cells was inhibited by a dominant-negative PTK7 mutant, an antibody against the extracellular domain of PTK7, and siRNA knockdown of PTK7. This resulted in decreased motility and invasivity of BC cells. We further examined PTK7 expression in BC and LN tissue of 128 BC patients by RT-PCR and its correlation with BC related genes like HER2, HER3, PAI1, MMP1, K19, and CD44. Expression profiling in BC cell lines and primary tumors showed association of PTK7 with ER/PR/HER2-negative (TNBC-triple negative BC) cancer. Oncomine data analysis confirmed this observation and classified PTK7 in a cluster with genes associated with agressive behavior of primary BC. Furthermore PTK7 expression was significantly different with respect to tumor size (ANOVA, p = 0.033) in BC and nodal involvement (ANOVA, p = 0.007) in LN. PTK7 expression in metastatic LN was related to shorter DFS (Cox Regression, p = 0.041). Our observations confirmed the transforming potential of PTK7, as well as its involvement in motility and invasivity of BC cells. PTK7 is highly expressed in TNBC cell lines. It represents a novel prognostic marker for BC patients and has potential therapeutic significance."
https://openalex.org/W2075430413,"The survival and colonization of tumor cells at new locations involve a variety of complex genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental factors. TRIM24 was originally named transcription intermediary factor 1-alpha (TIF1α), which was associated with cellular proliferation and was an oncogene in tumor development. Here we provide the first evidence of the expression profile and clinicopathological significance of TRIM24 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunohistochemistry was employed to determine the expression level of TRIM24 in HCC tissues and noncancerous liver tissues. Elevated TRIM24 level was found in 61.4% HCC samples (51/83) correlating with AFP (P = 0.036), poor differentiation (P = 0.004), intrahepatic metastasis (P = 0.004), recurrence (P = 0.000006), and shorter tumor-free survival time (P = 0.002). Small interfering RNA induced down-regulation of TRIM24 promoted apoptosis in HCC cell line HepG2. Moreover, western blotting analysis revealed that knockdown of TRIM24 increased the protein levels of p53, Bax, and Caspase-8, and decreased Bcl-2, Survivin, Cyclin D1, and CDK4. Depletion of TRIM24 decreased Snail, Slug, β-catenin, and Vimentin, and increased E-cadherin expression, which suggested the involvement of TRIM24 in EMT. These results indicated that TRIM24 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of human HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2061594475,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly cancer with a poor prognosis that is characterized by excessive mitogenic pathway activation and marked chemoresistance to a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic drugs. Dual specificity protein phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) is a key negative regulator of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Yet, DUSP1 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) in PDAC where it paradoxically enhances colony formation in soft agar and promotes in vivo tumorigenicity. However, it is not known whether DUSP1 overexpression contributes to PDAC chemoresistance. Using BxPC3 and COLO-357 human PCCs, we show that gemcitabine activates c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), key kinases in two major stress-activated signaling pathways. Gemcitabine-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation mediates increased apoptosis, but also transcriptionally upregulates DUSP1, as evidenced by increased DUSP1 mRNA levels and RNA polymerase II loading at DUSP1 gene body. Conversely, shRNA-mediated inhibition of DUSP1 enhances JNK and p38 MAPK activation and gemcitabine chemosensitivity. Using doxycycline-inducible knockdown of DUSP1 in established orthotopic pancreatic tumors, we found that combining gemcitabine with DUSP1 inhibition improves animal survival, attenuates angiogenesis, and enhances apoptotic cell death, as compared with gemcitabine alone. Taken together, these results suggest that gemcitabine-mediated upregulation of DUSP1 contributes to a negative feedback loop that attenuates its beneficial actions on stress pathways and apoptosis, raising the possibility that targeting DUSP1 in PDAC may have the advantage of enhancing gemcitabine chemosensitivity while suppressing angiogenesis."

Targeted stimulation of individual cones was combined with simultaneous recording from multiple retinal ganglion cells of identified types. The visual signal initiated by an individual cone produced strong responses with different kinetics in three of the four numerically dominant ganglion cell types.

In the visual system, the elementary sensory signal is transduction of light in a retinal photoreceptor cell. Parallel circuits process and transform this signal into spatiotemporal patterns of activity in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which are then transmitted to the brain and mediate visual function (Sterling and Demb, 2004Sterling P.

It also appears that, in daylight vision, the signals from individual cone photoreceptor signals can be detected centrally (Hofer et al., 2005Hofer H. Carroll J. Neitz J. Neitz M. Williams D.R.

However, fundamental questions remain about the signal arising from a single cone. What is the strength of this elementary signal in the downstream parallel pathways of the primate visual system? Do the specialized visual representations in different pathways arise from differential processing of elementary signals? How do the signals from different cones contribute to forming the spatial structure, kinetics, and nonlinearities in receptive fields of downstream neurons? Ultimately, these questions pertain not only to visual or sensory systems but also to the processing and representation of elementary signals in neural circuits generally. We examined the activity produced at the output of the primate retina by selective visual stimulation of individual cone photoreceptors and how this activity depends on stimulus strength, on the particular cone stimulated, and on the flow of visual signals through parallel retinal circuits. The results establish the basic properties of the elementary visual signal and how they shape the retinal output. To probe the elementary signal, light responses of RGCs were recorded from peripheral primate retina ex vivo using a high-density 512-electrode array (Chichilnisky and Baylor, 1999Chichilnisky E.J.

Dabrowski W. et al.Functional connectivity in the retina at the resolution of photoreceptors.Nature. 2010; 467: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The light responses of each RGC were first characterized at a coarse spatial scale by stimulating the retina with spatiotemporal noise and computing the spike-triggered average stimulus (see Experimental Procedures). This characterization was performed at an intensity that modulated cone signals but kept the rods in saturation (Rodieck, 1998Rodieck R.W. The First Steps in Seeing. Sinauer, Sunderland1998Google Scholar). Several features of the spike-triggered average, including spatial receptive field size and response dynamics, were used to identify the four numerically dominant ganglion cell types: ON and OFF midget, and ON and OFF parasol. The receptive fields of these cells were then measured at high resolution using spatiotemporal noise with small pixels. This characterization revealed punctate islands of light sensitivity within each receptive field (Figure 1A), which correspond to the locations of individual cones in the photoreceptor mosaic (Field et al., 2010Field G.D. Gauthier J.L. Sher A. Greschner M. Machado T.A. Jepson L.H. Shlens J. Gunning D.E. Mathieson K. Dabrowski W. et al.Functional connectivity in the retina at the resolution of photoreceptors.Nature. 2010; 467: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). High resolution receptive fields of many RGCs were then combined during ongoing recording to produce a local map of the cone mosaic (Figure 1B; see Experimental Procedures). Over some regions, the regular spacing of identified cones within the map indicated that it was nearly complete. To explore the visual signal initiated by individual cones, the cone mosaic map was then used to design second-pass high resolution stimuli, in which small regions of the display were selected to illuminate single cones without illuminating neighbors (e.g., Figure 2, black polygonal outlines). Brief steps of light were presented within these regions, as increments or decrements from a uniform gray field, while recording the activity of RGCs. L and M (Long- and middle-wavelength sensitive) cones were primarily targeted; S (short-wavelength sensitive) cones provide, at most, weak input to the RGC types tested (Field et al., 2010Field G.D. Gauthier J.L. Sher A. Greschner M. Machado T.A. Jepson L.H. Shlens J. Gunning D.E. Mathieson K. Dabrowski W. et al.Functional connectivity in the retina at the resolution of photoreceptors.Nature. 2010; 467: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Single-cone stimulation produced robust patterns of firing in RGCs, with single-trial responses often clearly discriminable from baseline firing (Figure 2). Strong responses were routinely observed in OFF midget and OFF parasol cells. ON midget cells generally responded somewhat more weakly (Figure 2, right column), while the ON parasol cells tested did not respond reliably to single-cone stimulation (see Discussion). In what follows, analysis will be focused on ON and OFF midget cells and OFF parasol cells. Signals from a single cone diverged to drive firing in more than one recorded RGC simultaneously (Figure 3). The observed signal divergence was consistent with the apparent overlap of receptive fields obtained from spatiotemporal noise stimulation at single-cone resolution (Field et al., 2010Field G.D. Gauthier J.L. Sher A. Greschner M. Machado T.A. Jepson L.H. Shlens J. Gunning D.E. Mathieson K.

Because RGCs of the same type exhibited relatively little receptive field overlap (Devries and Baylor, 1997Devries S.H. Baylor D.A.

Cones contributing to RGC receptive field surround regions were only weakly detectable in receptive field maps measured with spatiotemporal noise. However, the locations of cones in the receptive field surround could be inferred from the receptive field centers of neighboring RGCs. Stimulation of these surround cones resulted in weaker RGC responses, of opposite polarity (Figure 3, lower right panels). Different cone inputs to a given RGC typically elicited responses of different magnitude and kinetics, even when the stimulus contrast was the same (Figure 2). Does every cone drive the RGC with unique contrast response and kinetics? This possibility would complicate the interpretation of measurements of synaptic strength and plasticity. A simpler possibility would be that the cones providing input to a RGC vary only in the overall strength of their input but otherwise produce identical responses. To test this possibility, responses were measured as a function of contrast for each of four selected cone inputs to a given RGC. Response to single-cone stimulation increased nonlinearly with contrast, following an accelerating form suggesting thresholding and noise in the retinal circuitry and consistent with previous findings (Chichilnisky and Kalmar, 2002Chichilnisky E.J. Kalmar R.S. Functional asymmetries in ON and OFF ganglion cells of primate retina.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2737-2747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the response nonlinearity associated with different cones had a common form, the contrast axes for the four input cones were rescaled to allow for differences in cone input strength. After rescaling, these functions superimposed closely (Figure 4A), suggesting equivalent nonlinear response characteristics. Residual deviations after rescaling were 0.9%–6.5% of the maximum response amplitude across 47 RGCs tested (Figure 4B). To test whether the kinetics of response were also equivalent, responses elicited by stimulation of different cones but producing roughly equal response magnitude in a given RGC were compared (Figure 4A, bottom panel insets). The dynamics of these responses matched closely, even though the stimulus contrast eliciting them often differed significantly (e.g., Figure 4A, left panels). Thus, after normalizing for the overall input strength of each cone, RGC contrast response and kinetics were independent of the cone of origin (that is, they were univariant; see Discussion). Different RGC types exhibit diverse response properties, e.g., the well-established higher contrast sensitivity and more transient light responses in parasol compared to midget cells (Gouras, 1968Gouras P. Identification of cone mechanisms in monkey ganglion cells.J. Physiol. 1968; 199: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Kaplan and Shapley, 1986Kaplan E. Shapley R.M. The primate retina contains two types of ganglion cells, with high and low contrast sensitivity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1986; 83: 2755-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, Croner and Kaplan, 1995Croner L.J. Kaplan E. Receptive fields of P and M ganglion cells across the primate retina.Vision Res. 1995; 35: 7-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 1989Lee B.B. Martin P.R. Valberg A. Sensitivity of macaque retinal ganglion cells to chromatic and luminance flicker.J. Physiol. 1989; 414: 223-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). How do these specializations come about? A simple possibility is that these differences arise from the processing of elementary cone signals via the retinal circuitry and thus are evident in RGC responses to single-cone stimulation. To probe the origin of differences in contrast sensitivity, OFF midget and OFF parasol response amplitudes were compared as a function of contrast using single-cone stimulation. This measurement generally revealed similar contrast sensitivity in the two cell types, with slightly higher sensitivity in midget cells in some recordings (Figure 5A). Thus, the greater contrast sensitivity of parasol cells under stimulation at larger spatial scales apparently does not derive from the processing of individual cone signals in the retinal circuitry. Alternatively, the difference in contrast sensitivity could arise from the convergence of a larger number of cone inputs to parasol cells than midget cells (Kaplan et al., 1990Kaplan E. Lee B.B. Shapley R.M. New views of primate retinal function.in: Osborne N. Chader J. Progress in Retinal Research. Vol. 9. Pergamon Press, New York1990: 273-336Google Scholar). To test this possibility, the response of each RGC to stimulation of the entire receptive field center was estimated from the contrast-response function of a single cone within the receptive field (Figure 5A), scaled on the contrast axis by the fraction of the total input to the RGC provided by that cone, as estimated from receptive field maps obtained by reverse correlation (e.g., Figures 1, 2, and 3; see Discussion). This calculation produced contrast-response functions that were significantly steeper for parasol than for midget cells (Figure 5B), consistent with previous findings using coarser stimuli. The distribution of estimated contrast gains (initial slopes of contrast-response functions) for individual midget and parasol cells also resembled the distribution of contrast gains previously observed with drifting grating stimuli (Figure 5C) (Kaplan and Shapley, 1986Kaplan E. Shapley R.M. The primate retina contains two types of ganglion cells, with high and low contrast sensitivity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1986; 83: 2755-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Thus, the higher contrast sensitivity of OFF parasol cells relative to OFF midget cells may be a consequence of the difference in the number of cones providing input to cells of the two types (Kaplan et al., 1990Kaplan E. Lee B.B. Shapley R.M. New views of primate retinal function.in: Osborne N. Chader J. Progress in Retinal Research. Vol. 9. Pergamon Press, New York1990: 273-336Google Scholar). Although single-cone stimulation did not yield reliable responses in ON parasol cells, simultaneous stimulation of two cones in ON midget and ON parasol cells yielded similar or slightly higher sensitivity in midget cells (data not shown), consistent with the results of single-cone analysis in OFF midget and OFF parasol cells (see Discussion). To probe the origin of differences in response kinetics between midget and parasol cells, we compared the time course of response to single-cone stimulation. The response was notably more transient in parasol cells (Figures 2 and 3). Furthermore, the kinetics of single-cone responses were approximately predicted by the convolution of the light step time course with the impulse response of the RGC inferred from large-scale spatiotemporal noise stimulation, in both midget and parasol cells (data not shown) (Chichilnisky, 2001Chichilnisky E.J. A simple white noise analysis of neuronal light responses.Network. 2001; 12: 199-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the distinction between sustained and transient classes of RGCs does not depend on the aggregation of cone signals over space but arises from retinal processing of individual cone signals (see Discussion). Previous work has characterized the receptive fields of midget and parasol RGCs in primate retina using reverse correlation with high-resolution spatiotemporal noise stimuli (Field et al., 2010Field G.D. Gauthier J.L. Sher A. Greschner M. Machado T.A. Jepson L.H. Shlens J. Gunning D.E. Mathieson K. Dabrowski W. et al.Functional connectivity in the retina at the resolution of photoreceptors.Nature. 2010; 467: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This approach provides a rapid quantitative summary of cone input strength across the receptive field. Given the significant known nonlinearities in RGCs (e.g., Hochstein and Shapley, 1976Hochstein S. Shapley R.M. Linear and nonlinear spatial subunits in Y cat retinal ganglion cells.J. Physiol. 1976; 262: 265-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, Shapley and Victor, 1981Shapley R.M. Victor J.D. How the contrast gain control modifies the frequency responses of cat retinal ganglion cells.J. Physiol. 1981; 318: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), how accurately does this linear approximation capture the strength of cone inputs? A simple possibility is that the nonlinearities in RGC responses are of a form and magnitude that permit approximately veridical estimates of cone input strengths using spatiotemporal noise (e.g., see Chichilnisky, 2001Chichilnisky E.J. A simple white noise analysis of neuronal light responses.Network. 2001; 12: 199-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this possibility, the finding of univariance was exploited to obtain an estimate of the relative input strength of every cone in the receptive field. First, for each cone, a single scale factor was identified that, when multiplied by the contrast of the stimulus presented to that cone, brought its contrast-response function into register with the contrast-response functions of the other cones (see Figure 4). Because this factor effectively rescaled the stimulus, it was taken to indicate the relative strength of the input from that cone. The collection of scale factors obtained this way from every cone produced a spatial map of cone input strength (Figures 6B–6F, top). This map was then compared to the cone input strength map inferred from reverse correlation with spatiotemporal noise stimuli (Figures 6B–6F, bottom). The cone input strength maps obtained using the two approaches were similar in these examples and in aggregate (Figure 6G), although small discrepancies were visible (see Discussion). Across 21 OFF midget cells tested, the median R2 value relating the cone strength values obtained with the two methods was 0.80. Therefore, despite the nonlinear responses to stimulation of individual cones, receptive field maps obtained with spatiotemporal noise provided a roughly accurate description of the relative strength of input from each cone to each RGC. The structure of the activity in RGCs produced by stimulation of a single cone generally followed simple rules. Signals from each cone diverged to parallel retinal circuits, producing robust responses in at least three major RGC types, with similar magnitude but different kinetics in OFF midget and OFF parasol cells. For a given RGC, the contrast-response function and kinetics of light responses initiated by different cones were similar, yielding an effectively univariant light response. Differences in contrast sensitivity between midget and parasol cells were mostly attributable to cone convergence, whereas differences in response kinetics arose from processing of individual cone signals. The relative strengths of isolated inputs from different cones were well approximated by the input strength estimated using reverse correlation with high-resolution spatiotemporal noise. The divergence of signals from individual cones to multiple parallel circuits in the retina was strongly predicted from anatomical work showing that each cone feeds multiple bipolar cells of different types (Grünert et al., 1994Grünert U. Martin P.R. Wässle H. Immunocytochemical analysis of bipolar cells in the macaque monkey retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 348: 607-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Chun et al., 1996Chun M.H. Grünert U. Martin P.R. Wässle H. The synaptic complex of cones in the fovea and in the periphery of the macaque monkey retina.Vision Res. 1996; 36: 3383-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently, this prediction was reinforced in physiological recordings from complete populations of the four major primate RGC types, revealing the locations of individual cones in their receptive fields (Field et al., 2010Field G.D. Gauthier J.L. Sher A. Greschner M. Machado T.A. Jepson L.H. Shlens J. Gunning D.E. Mathieson K. Dabrowski W. et al.Functional connectivity in the retina at the resolution of photoreceptors.Nature. 2010; 467: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In that work, each of the four major RGC populations effectively sampled the entire mosaic of L and M (long and medium wavelength-sensitive) cones over a region of the retina, implying that, in general, each cone provided input to each of the four cell types. The current results on divergence (Figure 3) confirm these predictions and provide insight into the factors controlling response magnitude and kinetics in the different RGC types. The observation of robust RGC responses to stimulation of an individual photoreceptor has some precedent. A large body of work indicates that absorption of one or a few photons in rod photoreceptors can drive reliable visual signals in RGCs and can mediate effective stimulus detection in humans (see Field et al., 2005Field G.D. Sampath A.P. Rieke F. Retinal processing near absolute threshold: from behavior to mechanism.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 491-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, cones exhibit much lower unitary photovoltages than rods (Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1995Schneeweis D.M. Schnapf J.L. Photovoltage of rods and cones in the macaque retina.Science. 1995; 268: 1053-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and their signals are transmitted to RGCs by distinct circuitry under distinct adaptation conditions. Thus, a stronger prediction comes from anatomical work showing that, in the foveal region of the retina, midget RGCs receive input from only one cone (Wässle et al., 1994Wässle H. Grünert U. Martin P.R. Boycott B.B. Immunocytochemical characterization and spatial distribution of midget bipolar cells in the macaque monkey retina.Vision Res. 1994; 34: 561-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, Kolb and Marshak, 2003Kolb H. Marshak D. The midget pathways of the primate retina.Doc. Ophthalmol. 2003; 106: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Presumably, then, foveal midget cells can be strongly driven by one cone, and indeed behavioral evidence indicates that single-cone stimulation in central retina can produce reliable visual percepts (Hofer et al., 2005Hofer H. Carroll J. Neitz J. Neitz M. Williams D.R. Organization of the human trichromatic cone mosaic.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9669-9679Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, Sincich et al., 2009Sincich L.C. Zhang Y. Tiruveedhula P. Horton J.C. Roorda A. Resolving single cone inputs to visual receptive fields.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 967-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, at the peripheral retinal eccentricities sampled here, midget cells typically received significant input from 5–15 cones, while parasol cells received significant input from 40–80 cones (Figure 1). Thus, the present results demonstrate that even a cone that forms a relatively small fraction of the total input to a RGC can drive strong light responses in that cell. These findings are consistent with work in turtle retina indicating that electrical stimulation of a single cone yields robust firing in an RGC (Baylor and Fettiplace, 1977Baylor D.A. Fettiplace R. Transmission from photoreceptors to ganglion cells in turtle retina.J. Physiol. 1977; 271: 391-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); in this work, the number of cones in the receptive field was not measured but was probably larger than in primate midget cells. More recently, electrical stimulation of individual cones in primate retina was shown to drive significant synaptic currents in parasol cells (Ala-Laurila et al., 2011Ala-Laurila P. Greschner M. Chichilnisky E.J. Rieke F. Cone photoreceptor contributions to noise and correlations in the retinal output.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The present findings are also consistent with currents evoked in salamander RGCs by stimuli illuminating 1–2 cones (Soo et al., 2011Soo F.S. Schwartz G.W. Sadeghi K. Berry 2nd, M.J. Fine spatial information represented in a population of retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although again the number of cones feeding the RGCs was not reported. Reliable single-cone responses were not observed in ON parasol cells, which have the largest number of cone inputs of the RGC types tested, although responses to simultaneous stimulation of cone pairs were robust in some cases (data not shown). It remains to be determined whether this finding reflects different sensitivity in ON-parasol cells or limitations of the experimental preparation. Recent findings indicate that primate cones themselves respond more weakly to high-contrast increments than to high-contrast decrements (J. Angueyra & F. Rieke, personal communication), which may help explain the weaker responses in ON compared to OFF RGCs observed here, given that they were primarily targeted with matched polarity stimuli. This fact, coupled with the tendency toward slightly lower single-cone sensitivity in parasol cells compared to midget cells (Figure 5A), may explain the weak single-cone responses in ON parasol cells relative to the other cell types. In principle, cone-cone gap junction coupling (Hornstein et al., 2004Hornstein E.P. Verweij J. Schnapf J.L. Electrical coupling between red and green cones in primate retina.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) could contribute to divergence of single-cone signals. The results shown in Figure 3 suggest, however, that this effect is not large. For example, strong cones in receptive field center regions were observed immediately adjacent to known locations of cones that provided no discernible input, while cones in the receptive field surround generated robust responses of opposite polarity. However, the possibility of sporadic or nonisotropic cone coupling in some cases cannot be excluded. In principle, the multiple cone inputs that drive responses in an RGC could produce signals with distinct properties. For example, different cones could drive a given RGC with a different response time course, or a different dependence on stimulus contrast, depending on the specific ret"

Endothelial injury is considered to be an initiating factor for pulmonary vascular remodeling in animal models of PAH. Our previous study shows that simultaneous exposure to HIV-Trans-activator of transcription (Tat) and cocaine exacerbates both disruption of tight junction proteins and permeability of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells compared with either treatment alone. We here now demonstrate that this HIV-Tat and cocaine mediated endothelial dysfunction accompanies with increase in hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals generation and involves redox sensitive signaling pathway. Pretreatment with antioxidant cocktail attenuated the cocaine and Tat mediated disassembly of Zonula Occludens (ZO)-1 and enhancement of endothelial monolayer permeability. Furthermore, inhibition of NADPH oxidase by apocynin or siRNA-mediated knockdown of gp-91(phox) abolished the Tat/cocaine-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, suggesting the NADPH oxidase mediated generation of oxidative radicals. In addition, ROS dependent activation of Ras and ERK1/2 Kinase was observed to be mediating the TJP-1 disassembly, and endothelial dysfunction in response to cocaine and Tat exposure. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that Tat/cocaine -mediated production of ROS activate Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway that contributes to disruption of tight junction protein leading to pulmonary endothelial dysfunction associated with pulmonary vascular remodeling."

In this work, we describe miRNAs which are upregulated in Oncidium orchid roots after colonization by the fungus. Growth promotion and vigorous root development were observed in Oncidium hybrid orchid, while seedlings were colonized by P. indica. We performed a genome-wide expression profiling of small RNAs in Oncidium orchid roots either colonized or not-colonized by P. indica. After sequencing, 24,570,250 and 24744,141 clean reads were obtained from two libraries. 13,736 from 17,036,953 unique sequences showed homology to either 86 miRNA families described in 41 plant species, or to 46 potential novel miRNAs, or to 51 corresponding miRNA precursors. The predicted target genes of these miRNAs are mainly involved in auxin signal perception and transduction, transcription, development and plant defense. The expression analysis of miRNAs and target genes demonstrated the regulatory functions they may participate in. This study revealed that growth stimulation of the Oncidium orchid after colonization by P. indica includes an intricate network of miRNAs and their targets. The symbiotic function of P. indica on Oncidium orchid resembles previous findings on Chinese cabbage. This is the first study on growth regulation and development of Oncidium orchid by miRNAs induced by the symbiotic fungus P. indica."

Most of these programs have mechanisms to control the precision and accuracy with which visual stimuli are presented as well as the response times. However, external factors, often related to the technology used to display the visual information, can have a noticeable impact on the actual performance and may be easily overlooked by researchers. The aim of this study is to measure the precision and accuracy of the timing mechanisms of some of the most popular software packages used in a typical laboratory scenario in order to assess whether presentation times configured by researchers do not differ from measured times more than what is expected due to the hardware limitations. Despite the apparent precision and accuracy of the results, important issues related to timing setups in the presentation of visual stimuli were found, and they should be taken into account by researchers in their experiments."

Systemizing is defined as the drive to analyze a system in terms of the rules that govern the system in order to predict its behavior. Using voxel-based morphometry and questionnaires in a large sample of normal, right-handed young adults, we investigated the regional gray matter volume (rGMV) correlates of empathizing and systemizing and additionally those of the D score, which is the difference between systemizing and empathizing, to reveal the comprehensive picture of those correlates. Negative rGMV correlates of empathizing and positive rGMV correlates of the D score (formed by the negative correlation between rGMV and empathizing), were found primarily in nodes in the default mode network, mirror neuron system, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and the lateral part of the prefrontal cortex together with other areas. Positive rGMV correlates of systemizing and of the D score (formed by the positive correlation between rGMV and systemizing) were found primarily in nodes in the external attention system, middle cingulate cortex, and other regions. Negative rGMV correlates of systemizing were found in an area close to the left posterior insula and putamen. These findings reconcile some previously inconsistent findings, provide other new findings and suggest that these areas contribute to empathizing–systemizing. Furthermore, the negative/positive rGMV correlates of empathizing and positive/negative rGMV correlates of systemizing overlapped substantially. This may be in line with the notion that empathizing and systemizing compete neurally in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2092092194,"The organization of lipids within biological membranes is poorly understood. Some studies have suggested lipids group into microdomains within cells, but the evidence remains controversial due to non-native imaging techniques. A recently developed NanoSIMS technique indicated that sphingolipids group into microdomains within membranes of human fibroblast cells. We extended this NanoSIMS approach to study the localization of hopanoid lipids in bacterial cells by developing a stable isotope labeling method to directly detect subcellular localization of specific lipids in bacteria with ca. 60 nm resolution. Because of the relatively small size of bacterial cells and the relative abundance of hopanoid lipids in membranes, we employed a primary (2)H-label to maximize our limit of detection. This approach permitted the analysis of multiple stable isotope labels within the same sample, enabling visualization of subcellular lipid microdomains within different cell types using a secondary label to mark the growing end of the cell. Using this technique, we demonstrate subcellular localization of hopanoid lipids within alpha-proteobacterial and cyanobacterial cells. Further, we provide evidence of hopanoid lipid domains in between cells of the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme. More broadly, our method provides a means to image lipid microdomains in a wide range of cell types and test hypotheses for their functions in membranes."

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has demonstrated immunomodulatory properties in autoimmune murine and ex vivo human models. Our aim was to study serum levels of VIP during the follow-up of an early arthritis (EA) cohort and to analyze its value as a biomarker predicting severity and therapeutic requirements.Data from 91 patients on an EA register were analyzed (76% rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 24% undifferentiated arthritis, 73% women, and median age 54 years; median disease duration at entry, 5.4 months). We collected per protocol sociodemographic, clinical, and therapeutic data. VIP levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay in sera harvested from the 91 patients (353 visits; 3.9 visit/patient) and from 100 healthy controls. VIP values below the 25(th) percentile of those assessed in healthy population were considered low. To determine the effect of independent variables on VIP levels, we performed a longitudinal multivariate analysis nested by patient and visit. A multivariate ordered logistic regression was modeled to determine the effect of low VIP serum levels on disease activity at the end of follow-up.VIP concentrations varied considerably across EA patients. Those fulfilling the criteria for RA had the lowest values in the whole sample, although no significant differences were observed compared with healthy donors. Disease activity, which was assessed using DAS28, inversely correlated with VIP levels. After a two-year follow-up, those patients with low baseline levels of VIP displayed higher disease activity and received more intensive treatment.Patients who are unable to up-regulate VIP seem to have a worse clinical course despite receiving more intense treatment. Therefore, measurement of VIP levels may be suitable as a prognostic biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W1979127424,"Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma represent the two most common primary bone tumours in childhood and adolescence, with bone metastases being the most adverse prognostic factor. In prostate cancer, osseous metastasis poses a major clinical challenge. We developed a preclinical orthotopic model of Ewing sarcoma, reflecting the biology of the tumour-bone interactions in human disease and allowing in vivo monitoring of disease progression, and compared this with models of osteosarcoma and prostate carcinoma. Human tumour cell lines were transplanted into non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NSG) and Rag2(-/-/)γc(-/-) mice by intrafemoral injection. For Ewing sarcoma, minimal cell numbers (1000-5000) injected in small volumes were able to induce orthotopic tumour growth. Tumour progression was studied using positron emission tomography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and bioluminescent imaging. Tumours and their interactions with bones were examined by histology. Each tumour induced bone destruction and outgrowth of extramedullary tumour masses, together with characteristic changes in bone that were well visualised by computed tomography, which correlated with post-mortem histology. Ewing sarcoma and, to a lesser extent, osteosarcoma cells induced prominent reactive new bone formation. Osteosarcoma cells produced osteoid and mineralised ""malignant"" bone within the tumour mass itself. Injection of prostate carcinoma cells led to osteoclast-driven osteolytic lesions. Bioluminescent imaging of Ewing sarcoma xenografts allowed easy and rapid monitoring of tumour growth and detection of tumour dissemination to lungs, liver and bone. Magnetic resonance imaging proved useful for monitoring soft tissue tumour growth and volume. Positron emission tomography proved to be of limited use in this model. Overall, we have developed an orthotopic in vivo model for Ewing sarcoma and other primary and secondary human bone malignancies, which resemble the human disease. We have shown the utility of small animal bioimaging for tracking disease progression, making this model a useful assay for preclinical drug testing."
https://openalex.org/W2065481158,"With the trend of an increasing aged population worldwide, Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, as one of the major causes of dementia in elderly people is of growing concern. Despite the many hard efforts attempted during the past several decades in trying to elucidate the pathological mechanisms underlying AD and putting forward potential therapeutic strategies, there is still a lack of effective treatments for AD. The efficacy of many potential therapeutic drugs for AD is of main concern in clinical practice. For example, large bodies of evidence show that the anti-tumor histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, suberoylanilidehydroxamic acid (SAHA), may be of benefit for the treatment of AD; however, its extensive inhibition of HDACs makes it a poor therapeutic. Moreover, the natural flavonoid, curcumin, may also have a potential therapeutic benefit against AD; however, it is plagued by low bioavailability. Therefore, the integrative effects of SAHA and curcumin were investigated as a protection against amyloid-beta neurotoxicity in vitro. We hypothesized that at low doses their synergistic effect would improve therapeutic selectivity, based on experiments that showed that at low concentrations SAHA and curcumin could provide comprehensive protection against Aβ25–35-induced neuronal damage in PC12 cells, strongly implying potent synergism. Furthermore, network analysis suggested that the possible mechanism underlying their synergistic action might be derived from restoration of the damaged functional link between Akt and the CBP/p300 pathway, which plays a crucial role in the pathological development of AD. Thus, our findings provided a feasible avenue for the application of a synergistic drug combination, SAHA and curcumin, in the treatment of AD."

Control was assessed by symptom questionnaire (children) and by Asthma Control Questionnaire and current exacerbation (adults). Saliva was collected in all subjects. We applied principal component analysis to a 10-plex panel of relevant inflammatory markers to characterize marker profiles and determined if profiles were associated with asthma control.There were similar, strong correlations amongst biologically related markers in both populations: eosinophil-related: eotaxin-1/CCL11, RANTES/CCL5, and IL-5 (p<.001); myeloid/innate: IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1/CCL2, and IL-8/CXCL8 (p<.001). The first three principal components captured ≥74% of variability across all ten analytes in both populations. In adults, the Principal Component 1 score, broadly reflective of all markers, but with greater weight given to myeloid/innate markers, was associated with Asthma Control Questionnaire score and exacerbation. The Principal Component 3 score, reflective of IP-10/CXCL10, was associated with current exacerbation. In children, the Principal Component 1, 2, and 3 scores were associated with recent asthma symptoms. The Principal Component 2 score, reflective of higher eosinophil markers, was inversely correlated with symptoms.

Using the diet, we established and validated a dietary exposure assay by using the protease inhibitor E-64 as positive control. Dose-dependent responses were documented for all observed life-table parameters of P. japonica including survival, pupation and eclosion rates, development time and adult weight. Results suggested that the dietary assay can detect the effects of insecticidal compounds on the survival and development of P. japonica. Using the established dietary assay, we subsequently tested the toxicity of Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac and Cry1F proteins that are expressed by transgenic maize, cotton or rice plants to P. japonica larvae. The diet containing E-64 was included as a positive control. Survival and development of P. japonica larvae were not adversely affected when the diet contained purified Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, or Cry1F at 500 µg/g diet representing a worst-case exposure scenario. In contrast, P. japonica larvae were adversely affected when the diet contained E-64. The bioactivity and stability of the Cry proteins in the diet and Cry protein uptake by the ladybird larvae were confirmed by bioassay with a Cry-sensitive insect species and by ELISA. The current study describes a suitable experimental system for assessing the potential effects of gut-active insecticidal compounds on ladybird beetle larvae. The experiments with the Cry proteins demonstrate that P. japonica larvae are not sensitive to Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac and Cry1F."

Functional inactivation of Hjv leads to severe iron overload in humans and mice due to marked suppression of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin. To investigate the role of Hjv in body iron sensing, Hjv-/- mice and isogenic wild type controls were placed on a moderately low, a standard or a high iron diet for four weeks. Hjv-/- mice developed systemic iron overload under all regimens. Transferrin (Tf) was highly saturated regardless of the dietary iron content, while liver iron deposition was proportional to it. Hepcidin mRNA expression responded to fluctuations in dietary iron intake, despite the absence of Hjv. Nevertheless, iron-dependent upregulation of hepcidin was more than an order of magnitude lower compared to that seen in wild type controls. Likewise, iron signaling via the BMP/Smad pathway was preserved but substantially attenuated. These findings suggest that Hjv is not required for sensing of body iron levels and merely functions as an enhancer for iron signaling to hepcidin."

However, in a subset of rats, kainic acid treatment does not induce overt behaviorally obvious acute SE. The goal of this study was to compare the neuroanatomical and behavioral changes induced by kainate in rats that developed convulsive SE to those who did not. Adult male Wistar rats were treated with kainic acid and tested behaviorally 5 months later. Rats that had experienced convulsive SE showed impaired performance on the spatial water maze and passive avoidance tasks, and on the context and tone retention tests following fear conditioning. In addition, they exhibited less anxiety-like behaviors than controls on the open-field and elevated plus-maze tests. Histologically, convulsive SE was associated with marked neuron loss in the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 fields, and in the dentate hilus. Rats that had not experienced convulsive SE after kainate treatment showed less severe, but significant impairments on the spatial water maze and passive avoidance tasks. These rats had fewer neurons than control rats in the dentate hilus, but not in the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 fields. Correlational analyses revealed significant relationships between spatial memory indices of rats and neuronal numbers in the dentate hilus and CA3 pyramidal field. These results show that a part of the animals that do not display intense behavioral seizures (convulsive SE) immediately after an epileptogenic treatment, later in life, they may still have noticeable structural and functional changes in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2118114211,"The role of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in the control of emotional behavior remains to be determined. We analyzed the effects of the central administration of 1-oleoyl-LPA (LPA 18∶1) in rats tested for food consumption and anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors. For this purpose, the elevated plus-maze, open field, Y maze, forced swimming and food intake tests were performed. In addition, c-Fos expression in the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG) was also determined. The results revealed that the administration of LPA 18∶1 reduced the time in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze and induced hypolocomotion in the open field, suggesting an anxiogenic-like phenotype. Interestingly, these effects were present following LPA 18∶1 infusion under conditions of novelty but not under habituation conditions. In the forced swimming test, the administration of LPA 18∶1 dose-dependently increased depression-like behavior, as evaluated according to immobility time. LPA treatment induced no effects on feeding. However, the immunohistochemical analysis revealed that LPA 18∶1 increased c-Fos expression in the DPAG. The abundant expression of the LPA1 receptor, one of the main targets for LPA 18∶1, was detected in this brain area, which participates in the control of emotional behavior, using immunocytochemistry. These findings indicate that LPA is a relevant transmitter potentially involved in normal and pathological emotional responses, including anxiety and depression."

https://openalex.org/W2084025901,"Model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, allow us to address a wide range of biological questions with experimental rigour. However, studies in model species need to be complemented by comparative studies if we are to fully understand the functional properties and evolutionary history of developmental processes. The establishment of new model organisms is crucial for this purpose. One of the first essential steps to establish a species as an experimental model is to carefully describe its life cycle and development. The resulting staging scheme serves as a framework for molecular studies, and allows us to homologise developmental processes between species. In this paper, we have characterised the life cycle and development of an emerging non-drosophilid dipteran model system: the moth midge Clogmia albipunctata. In particular, we focus on early embryogenesis (cleavage and blastoderm cycles before gastrulation), on formation and retraction of extraembryonic tissues, and on formation of the germ line. Considering the large evolutionary distance between the two species (approximately 250 million years), we find that the development of C. albipunctata is remarkably conserved compared to D. melanogaster. On the other hand, we detect significant differences in morphology and timing affecting the development of extraembryonic tissues and the germ line. Moreover, C. albipunctata shows several heterochronic shifts, and lacks head involution and associated processes during late stages of development."
https://openalex.org/W2105443877,"Model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, provide powerful experimental tools for the study of development. However, approaches using model systems need to be complemented by comparative studies for us to gain a deeper understanding of the functional properties and evolution of developmental processes. New model organisms need to be established to enable such comparative work. The establishment of new model system requires a detailed description of its life cycle and development. The resulting staging scheme is essential for providing morphological context for molecular studies, and allows us to homologise developmental processes between species. In this paper, we provide a staging scheme and morphological characterisation of the life cycle for an emerging non-drosophilid dipteran model system: the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita. We pay particular attention to early embryogenesis (cleavage and blastoderm stages up to gastrulation), the formation and retraction of extraembryonic tissues, and the determination and formation of germ (pole) cells. Despite the large evolutionary distance between the two species (approximately 150 million years), we find that M. abdita development is remarkably similar to D. melanogaster in terms of developmental landmarks and their relative timing."
https://openalex.org/W1969116665,"It is likely that the strength of selection acting upon a mutation varies through time due to changes in the environment. However, most population genetic theory assumes that the strength of selection remains constant. Here we investigate the consequences of fluctuating selection pressures on the quantification of adaptive evolution using McDonald-Kreitman (MK) style approaches. In agreement with previous work, we show that fluctuating selection can generate evidence of adaptive evolution even when the expected strength of selection on a mutation is zero. However, we also find that the mutations, which contribute to both polymorphism and divergence tend, on average, to be positively selected during their lifetime, under fluctuating selection models. This is because mutations that fluctuate, by chance, to positive selected values, tend to reach higher frequencies in the population than those that fluctuate towards negative values. Hence the evidence of positive adaptive evolution detected under a fluctuating selection model by MK type approaches is genuine since fixed mutations tend to be advantageous on average during their lifetime. Never-the-less we show that methods tend to underestimate the rate of adaptive evolution when selection fluctuates."
https://openalex.org/W2013777833,"Heterosis, the greater vigor of hybrids compared to their parents, has been exploited in maize breeding for more than 100 years to produce ever better performing elite hybrids of increased yield. Despite extensive research, the underlying mechanisms shaping the extent of heterosis are not well understood, rendering the process of selecting an optimal set of parental lines tedious. This study is based on a dataset consisting of 112 metabolite levels in young roots of four parental maize inbred lines and their corresponding twelve hybrids, along with the roots' biomass as a heterotic trait. Because the parental biomass is a poor predictor for hybrid biomass, we established a model framework to deduce the biomass of the hybrid from metabolite profiles of its parental lines. In the proposed framework, the hybrid metabolite levels are expressed relative to the parental levels by incorporating the standard concept of additivity/dominance, which we name the Combined Relative Level (CRL). Our modeling strategy includes a feature selection step on the parental levels which are demonstrated to be predictive of CRL across many hybrid metabolites. We demonstrate that these selected parental metabolites are further predictive of hybrid biomass. Our approach directly employs the diallel structure in a multivariate fashion, whereby we attempt to not only predict macroscopic phenotype (biomass), but also molecular phenotype (metabolite profiles). Therefore, our study provides the first steps for further investigations of the genetic determinants to metabolism and, ultimately, growth. Finally, our success on the small-scale experiments implies a valid strategy for large-scale experiments, where parental metabolite profiles may be used together with profiles of selected hybrids as a training set to predict biomass of all possible hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W2023971486,"The mouse genome consists of six functional actin genes of which the expression patterns are temporally and spatially regulated during development and in the adult organism. Deletion of beta-actin in mouse is lethal during embryonic development, although there is compensatory expression of other actin isoforms. This suggests different isoform specific functions and, more in particular, an important function for beta-actin during early mammalian development. We here report a role for beta-actin during neural crest ontogeny. Although beta-actin null neural crest cells show expression of neural crest markers, less cells delaminate and their migration arrests shortly after. These phenotypes were associated with elevated apoptosis levels in neural crest cells, whereas proliferation levels were unchanged. Specifically the pre-migratory neural crest cells displayed higher levels of apoptosis, suggesting increased apoptosis in the neural tube accounts for the decreased amount of migrating neural crest cells seen in the beta-actin null embryos. These cells additionally displayed a lack of membrane bound N-cadherin and dramatic decrease in cadherin-11 expression which was more pronounced in the pre-migratory neural crest population, potentially indicating linkage between the cadherin-11 expression and apoptosis. By inhibiting ROCK ex vivo, the knockout neural crest cells regained migratory capacity and cadherin-11 expression was upregulated. We conclude that the presence of beta-actin is vital for survival, specifically of pre-migratory neural crest cells, their proper emigration from the neural tube and their subsequent migration. Furthermore, the absence of beta-actin affects cadherin-11 and N-cadherin function, which could partly be alleviated by ROCK inhibition, situating the Rho-ROCK signaling in a feedback loop with cadherin-11."
https://openalex.org/W2094152435,"Neuropeptides play essential roles in a variety of physiological responses that contribute to the development and reproduction of insects. Both the diapause hormone (DH) and pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) belong to the PBAN/pyrokinin neuropeptide family, which has a conserved pentapeptide motif FXPRL at the C-terminus. We identified the full-length cDNA encoding DH-PBAN in Maruca vitrata, a major lepidopteran pest of leguminous crops. The open reading frame of Marvi-DH-PBAN is 591 bp in length, encoding 197 amino acids, from which five putative neuropeptides [DH, PBAN, α-subesophageal ganglion neuropeptide (SGNP), β-SGNP and γ-SGNP] are derived. Marvi-DH-PBAN was highly similar (83%) to DH-PBAN of Omphisa fuscidentalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), but possesses a unique C-terminal FNPRL motif, where asparagine has replaced a serine residue present in other lepidopteran PBAN peptides. The genomic DNA sequence of Marvi-DH-PBAN is 6,231 bp in size and is composed of six exons. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that the Marvi-DH-PBAN protein sequence is closest to its homolog in Crambidae, but distant from Diptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera DH-PBAN, which agrees with the current taxonomy. DH-PBAN transcripts were present in the head and thoracic complex, but absent in the abdomen of M. vitrata. Real-time quantitative PCR assays have demonstrated a relatively higher expression of Marvi-DH-PBAN mRNA in the latter half of the pupal stages and in adults. These findings represent a significant step forward in our understanding of the DH-PBAN gene architecture and phylogeny, and raise the possibility of using Marvi-DH-PBAN to manage M. vitrata populations through molecular techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2032815392,"Voltage-gated ion channels exhibit complex properties, which can be targeted in pharmacological therapies for disease. Here, we report that the pro-oxidant, tert-butyl dihydroquinone (BHQ), modulates Cav2.1 Ca2+ channels in ways that oppose defects in channel gating and synaptic transmission resulting from a familial hemiplegic migraine mutation (S218L). BHQ slows deactivation, inhibits voltage-dependent activation, and potentiates Ca2+-dependent facilitation of Cav2.1 channels in transfected HEK293T cells. These actions of BHQ help offset the gain of function and reduced Ca2+-dependent facilitation of Cav2.1 channels with the S218L mutation. Transgenic expression of the mutant channels at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction causes abnormally elevated evoked postsynaptic potentials and impaired synaptic plasticity, which are largely restored to the wild-type phenotypes by BHQ. Our results reveal a mechanism by which a Cav2.1 gating modifier can ameliorate defects associated with a disease-causing mutation in Cav2.1."
https://openalex.org/W2050753268,"Signals of fighting indicate an animal's intention to attack and so they serve to prevent costly aggressive encounters. However, according to theory, a signal that is different in design (i.e. a novel signal) but that fails to inform fighting intentions will result in negative fitness consequences for the bearer. In the present study we used males of the territorial damselfly Hetaerina americana, which have a red wing spot during territory defense that has evolved as a signal of fighting ability. By producing a novel signal (covering the red spot with blue ink) in territory owners, we investigated: a) the behavioral responses by conspecific males; b) survival cost and c) three physiological mediators of impaired survival: muscular fat reserves, muscle mass and immune ability. We predicted that males with the novel signal would be attacked more often by conspecifics as the former would fail to convey fighting ability and intentions adequately. This will result in lower survival and physiological condition for the novel signal bearers. We found that, compared to control males (males whose red spot was not changed), experimental males had reduced survival, were less able to hold a territory, and had a reduced muscle mass. It seems that spot modified males were not able to effectively communicate their territory tenancy, which may explain why they lost their defended sites. Our results provide support for theoretical models that a novel signal that fails to informing fighting ability may lead to a fitness cost for bearers."
https://openalex.org/W2020664009,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are cation-selective channels present in retina, brain and heart. The activity of HCN channels contributes to signal integration, cell excitability and pacemaker activity. HCN1 channels expressed in photoreceptors participate in keeping light responses transient and are required for normal mesopic vision. The subcellular localization of HCN1 varies among cell types. In photoreceptors HCN1 is concentrated in the inner segments while in other retinal neurons, HCN1 is evenly distributed though the cell. This is in contrast to hippocampal neurons where HCN1 is concentrated in a subset of dendrites. A key regulator of HCN1 trafficking and activity is tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b interacting protein (TRIP8b). Multiple splice isoforms of TRIP8b are expressed throughout the brain and can differentially regulate the surface expression and activity of HCN1. The purpose of the present study was to determine which isoforms of TRIP8b are expressed in the retina and to test if loss of TRIP8b alters HCN1 expression or trafficking. We found that TRIP8b colocalizes with HCN1 in multiple retina neurons and all major splice isoforms of TRIP8b are expressed in the retina. Photoreceptors express three different isoforms. In TRIP8b knockout mice, the ability of HCN1 to traffic to the surface of retinal neurons is unaffected. However, there is a large decrease in the total amount of HCN1. We conclude that TRIP8b in the retina is needed to achieve maximal expression of HCN1."
https://openalex.org/W2030907624,"Modern anti-retroviral therapy is highly effective at suppressing viral replication and restoring immune function in HIV-infected persons. However, such individuals show reduced physiological performance and increased frailty compared with age-matched uninfected persons. Contemporary anti-retroviral therapy is thought to be largely free from neuromuscular complications, whereas several anti-retroviral drugs previously in common usage have been associated with mitochondrial toxicity. It has recently been established that patients with prior exposure to such drugs exhibit irreversible cellular and molecular mitochondrial defects. However the functional significance of such damage remains unknown. Here we use phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) to measure in vivo muscle mitochondrial oxidative function, in patients treated with contemporary anti-retroviral therapy, and compare with biopsy findings (cytochrome c oxidase (COX) histochemistry). We show that dynamic oxidative function (post-exertional ATP (adenosine triphosphate) resynthesis) was largely maintained in the face of mild to moderate COX defects (affecting up to ∼10% of fibers): τ½ ADP (half-life of adenosine diphosphate clearance), HIV-infected 22.1±9.9 s, HIV-uninfected 18.8±4.4 s, p = 0.09. In contrast, HIV-infected patients had a significant derangement of resting state ATP metabolism compared with controls: ADP/ATP ratio, HIV-infected 1.24±0.08×10−3, HIV-uninfected 1.16±0.05×10−3, p = 0.001. These observations are broadly reassuring in that they suggest that in vivo mitochondrial function in patients on contemporary anti-retroviral therapy is largely maintained at the whole organ level, despite histochemical (COX) defects within individual cells. Basal energy requirements may nevertheless be increased."
https://openalex.org/W2042736148,"Chromosomal anomalies in human embryos produced by in vitro fertilization are very common, which include numerical (aneuploidy) and structural (deletion, duplication or others) anomalies. Our previous study indicated that chromosomal deletion(s) is the most common structural anomaly accounting for approximately 8% of euploid blastocysts. It is still unknown if these deletions in human euploid blastocysts have clinical significance. In this study, we analyzed 15 previously diagnosed euploid blastocysts that had chromosomal deletion(s) using Agilent oligonucleotide DNA microarray platform and localized the gene location in each deletion. Then, we used OMIM gene map and phenotype database to investigate if these deletions are related with some important genes that cause genetic diseases, especially developmental delay or intellectual disability. As results, we found that the detectable chromosomal deletion size with Agilent microarray is above 2.38 Mb, while the deletions observed in human blastocysts are between 11.6 to 103 Mb. With OMIM gene map and phenotype database information, we found that deletions can result in loss of 81-464 genes. Out of these genes, 34–149 genes are related with known genetic problems. Furthermore, we found that 5 out of 15 samples lost genes in the deleted region, which were related to developmental delay and/or intellectual disability. In conclusion, our data indicates that all human euploid blastocysts with chromosomal deletion(s) are abnormal and transfer of these embryos may cause birth defects and/or developmental and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, the embryos with chromosomal deletion revealed by DNA microarray should not be transferred to the patients, or further gene map and/or phenotype seeking is necessary before making a final decision."
https://openalex.org/W2030203770,"Exome sequence capture and massively parallel sequencing can be combined to achieve inexpensive and rapid global analyses of the functional sections of the genome. The difficulties of working with relatively small quantities of genetic material, as may be necessary when sharing tumor biopsies between collaborators for instance, can be overcome using whole genome amplification. However, the potential drawbacks of using a whole genome amplification technology based on random primers in combination with sequence capture followed by massively parallel sequencing have not yet been examined in detail, especially in the context of mutation discovery in tumor material. In this work, we compare mutations detected in sequence data for unamplified DNA, whole genome amplified DNA, and RNA originating from the same tumor tissue samples from 16 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer. The results obtained provide a comprehensive overview of the merits of these techniques for mutation analysis. We evaluated the identified genetic variants, and found that most (74%) of them were observed in both the amplified and the unamplified sequence data. Eighty-nine percent of the variations found by WGA were shared with unamplified DNA. We demonstrate a strategy for avoiding allelic bias by including RNA-sequencing information."
https://openalex.org/W1993180764,"A large group of odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) has attracted great scientific interest as promising building blocks in constructing optical biosensors for dangerous substances, such as toxic and explosive molecules. Native tissue-extracted bovine OBP (bOBP) has a unique dimer folding pattern that involves crossing the α-helical domain in each monomer over the other monomer's β-barrel. In contrast, recombinant bOBP maintaining the high level of stability inherent to native tissue bOBP is produced in a stable native-like state with a decreased tendency for dimerization and is a mixture of monomers and dimers in a buffered solution. This work is focused on the study of the quaternary structure and the folding-unfolding processes of the recombinant bOBP in the absence and in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). Our results show that the recombinant bOBP native dimer is only formed at elevated GdnHCl concentrations (1.5 M). This process requires re-organizing the protein structure by progressing through the formation of an intermediate state. The bOBP dimerization process appears to be irreversible and it occurs before the protein unfolds. Though the observed structural changes for recombinant bOBP at pre-denaturing GdnHCl concentrations show a local character and the overall protein structure is maintained, such changes should be considered where the protein is used as a sensitive element in a biosensor system."
https://openalex.org/W2036596206,"We investigated the polymorphism of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and Duffy erythrocyte antigens in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients in southern Brazil. One hundred and eighty-three CKD patients, over 18 years old, on hemodialysis, were included. HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 typing was performed using the LABType®SSO (One Lambda, Inc.). Duffy phenotypes were determined by gel column agglutination using anti-Fy(a) and anti-Fy(b) monoclonal anti-sera. The patients' predominant ages ranged between 51 and 70 years (43%) and the predominant gender, ethnic group and dialysis period were, respectively, male (62%), white (62%) and 1-3 years (40%). The highest and lowest frequencies of Duffy phenotypes were Fy(a+b+) and Fy(a-b-), respectively. Nineteen HLA-A, 30 HLA-B and 13 HLA-DRB1 allele groups were identified. The most frequent HLA allele groups were HLA-A*01, -A*02, -A*03, -A*11, -A*24; HLA-B*07, -B*15, -B*35, -B*44, -B*51; HLA-DRB1*03, -DRB1*04, -DRB1*07, -DRB1*11 and -DRB1*13. Statistically significant differences were observed in the Duffy and HLA polymorphisms compared between CKD patients and healthy subjects. The Fy(a+b-) phenotype (p<0.0001, OR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.60-4.07) was the most frequent in the patients (p<0.05), and the Fy(a+b+) phenotype (p = 0.0039, OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.18-2.51) was the most frequent in the healthy subjects in the same region of Paraná state (p<0.05). Regarding HLA, the HLA-B*42, -B*45, -B*51 and -DRB1*03 allele groups were the most frequent in the patients (p<0.05), and the HLA-B*44 allele group was the most frequent in the healthy subjects in the same region of Brazil (p<0.05). The polymorphism of these two markers among CKD patients in southern Brazil and healthy subjects of other studies, suggests that these markers might be involved with CKD development. Further studies should be undertaken to analyze the markers' influence on CKD and the long-term results from kidney transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2036081010,"The multidrug-resistant phenotype of tumor cells is acquired via an increased capability of drug efflux by ABC transporters and causes serious problems in cancer treatment. With the aim to uncover whether changes induced by epigenetic mechanisms in the expression level of drug transporter genes correlates with changes in the drug resistance phenotypes of resistant cells, we studied the expression of drug transporters in rat hepatoma cell lines. We found that of the three major rat ABC transporter genes Abcb1a, Abcb1b and Abcc1 the activity of only Abcb1b increased significantly in colchicine-selected, drug-resistant cells. Increased transporter expression in drug-resistant cells results primarily from transcriptional activation. A change in histone modification at the regulatory regions of the chromosomally adjacent Abcb1a and Abcb1b genes differentially affects the levels of corresponding mRNAs. Transcriptional up- and down-regulation accompany an increase in acetylation levels of histone H3 lysine 9 at the promoter regions of Abcb1b and Abcb1a, respectively. Drug efflux activity, however, does not follow tightly the transcriptional activity of drug transporter genes in hepatoma cells. Our results point out the need for careful analysis of cause-and-effect relationships between changes in histone modification, drug transporter expression and drug resistance phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2083355345,"The cellular and molecular-scale processes underlying the stability of coral-Symbiodinium endosymbioses remain unclear despite decades of investigation. As the coral gastroderm is the only tissue layer characterized by this unique symbiotic association, the membranes of these symbiotic gastrodermal cells (SGCs) may play important roles in the initiation and maintenance of the endosymbiosis. In order to elucidate the interactions between the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates and their coral hosts, a thorough characterization of SGC membranes is therefore required. Cell surface proteins of isolated SGCs were biotinylated herein by a cell impermeant agent, biotin-XX sulfosuccinimidyl ester. The in situ distribution of these biotinylated proteins was uncovered by both fluorescence and transmission electron microscopic imaging of proteins bound to Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated streptavidin. The identity of these proteins was then determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Nineteen (19) proteins were identified, and they are known to be involved in the molecular chaperone/stress response, cytoskeletal remodeling, and energy metabolism. These results not only reveal the molecular characters of the host SGC membrane, but also provide critical insight into understanding the possible role of host membranes in this ecologically important endosymbiotic association."
https://openalex.org/W2014918922,"This article presents the NeoHelp visual stimulus set created to facilitate investigation of need-of-help recognition with clinical and normative populations of different ages, including children. Need-of-help recognition is one aspect of socioemotional development and a necessary precondition for active helping. The NeoHelp consists of picture pairs showing everyday situations: The first item in a pair depicts a child needing help to achieve a goal; the second one shows the child achieving the goal. Pictures of birds in analogue situations are also included. These control stimuli enable implementation of a human-animal categorization task which serves to separate behavioral correlates specific to need-of-help recognition from general differentiation processes. It is a concern in experimental research to ensure that results do not relate to systematic perceptual differences when comparing responses to categories of different content. Therefore, we not only derived the NeoHelp-pictures within a pair from one another by altering as little as possible, but also assessed their perceptual similarity empirically. We show that NeoHelp-picture pairs are very similar regarding low-level perceptual properties across content categories. We obtained data from 60 children in a broad age range (4 to 13 years) for three different paradigms, in order to assess whether the intended categorization and differentiation could be observed reliably in a normative population. Our results demonstrate that children can differentiate the pictures' content regarding both need-of-help category as well as species as intended in spite of the high perceptual similarities. We provide standard response characteristics (hit rates and response times) that are useful for future selection of stimuli and comparison of results across studies. We show that task requirements coherently determine which aspects of the pictures influence response characteristics. Thus, we present NeoHelp, the first open-access standardized visual stimuli set for investigation of need-of-help recognition and invite researchers to use and extend it."
https://openalex.org/W2020173686,"Chronic tinnitus is a brain network disorder with involvement of auditory and non-auditory areas. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the temporal cortex has been investigated for the treatment of tinnitus. Several small studies suggest that motor cortex excitability is altered in people with tinnitus. We retrospectively analysed data from 231 patients with chronic tinnitus and 120 healthy controls by pooling data from different studies. Variables of interest were resting motor threshold (RMT), short-interval intra-cortical inhibition (SICI), intra-cortical facilitation (ICF), and cortical silent period (CSP). 118 patients were tested twice - before and after ten rTMS treatment sessions over the left temporal cortex. In tinnitus patients SICI and ICF were increased and CSP was shortened as compared to healthy controls. There was no group difference in RMT. Treatment related amelioration of tinnitus symptoms were correlated with normalisations in SICI. These findings confirm earlier studies of abnormal motor cortex excitability in tinnitus patients. Moreover our longitudinal data suggest that altered SICI may reflect a state parameter, whereas CSP and ICF may rather mirror a trait-like predisposing factor of tinnitus. These findings are new and innovative as they enlarge the knowledge about basic physiologic and neuroplastic processes in tinnitus."

https://openalex.org/W2085870335,"Background Variability in intracoronary computed tomography (CT) number may influence vessel quantification. We confirmed the feasibility of a novel method for measuring vessel diameter and area using coronary CT angiography (CCTA) with an optimized intracoronary CT number, 350 HU. Methods We performed intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging in 52 patients with significant stenosis detected by coronary CT angiography targeting 350 HU using a CT number-controlling system. We measured 0-to-0 HU distances in the cross-sectional coronary images of 32 patients. We analyzed the ratio of 0-to-0 HU distances in CT images to media-to-media distances in IVUS images (C:I ratio). The area of ≥0 HU for 103 representative points in the remaining 20 patients was compared to the area of the traced external elastic membrane (EEM) in IVUS images. Results There was a strong correlation between 0-to-0 HU distance in CT images and media-to-media diameter in IVUS images (r = 0.97, p<0.001). The C:I ratio was 1.1. EEM area was estimated by dividing the area of ≥0 HU by the square of C:I. There was also a strong correlation between the estimated EEM area and the EEM area in IVUS images (r = 0.95, p<0.001). Conclusions Media-to-media diameter and EEM area can be estimated by CCTA targeting the optimized intracoronary CT number when blood vessel borders are defined at 0 HU."
