These tetragonal materials, synthesized at high pressure and temperature, are different from the previously known germanium and silicon disulfides."
https://openalex.org/W2049772653,"Adults of three cichlid species, Hemichromis bimaculatus Gill, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum (Gunther), and Pterophyllum sp., produce sounds of apparent biological significance. Both sexes of H. bimaculatus produce sounds, but whether both sexes in the other species produce sounds has not been established. The most intense tone frequencies in H. bimaculatus and C. nigrofasciatum lie generally between 300 and 500 cycles per second. The sound produced by Pterophyllum sp., however, has a broad maximum intensity around 3500 cycles per second and component frequencies over 10,000 cycles per second. Sound production appears to depend on the aggressiveness of the individual."

The movements are usually accomplished at night in rain, fog, or cloudy weather when visible celestial cues may not be available. The sensory basis for the orienting ability is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1977588439,"A diet of senescent Brassica spp. delayed sexual maturation in the desert locust. The senescent leaves were shown to be short of gibberellins, and a dietary supplement of gibberellin A(3) (1 microgram per locust per day) restored the rate of maturation to that found in animals feeding on green leaves. An external application of eugenol had a similar effect. The sexual immaturity of desert locusts during the dry season may result from the senescent condition of their desert food plants."

https://openalex.org/W1969728537,The changes which take place in the tail of the male lyrebird as it develops to maturity over a period of 7 to 8 years are attributable both to moulting and to processes whereby certain plain feathers are transformed into filamentaries and medians by growth of the rachis and loss of barbs and barbules.

https://openalex.org/W2067376678,"Cyr61 is a secreted, heparin-binding, extracellular matrix-associated
protein whose activities include the promotion of adhesion and chemotaxis, and
the stimulation of fibroblast and endothelial cell growth. Many, if not all,
of these activities of Cyr61 are mediated through interactions with integrins.
We explore the role of Cyr61 in the early development of Xenopus
laevis. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments show that Xcyr61 is
required for normal gastrulation movements. This role is mediated in part
through the adhesive properties of Xcyr61 and its related ability to modulate
assembly of the extracellular matrix. In addition, Xcyr61 can, in a
context-dependent manner, stimulate or inhibit signalling through the Wnt
pathway. These properties of Xcyr61 provide a mechanism for integrating cell
signalling, cell adhesion and cell migration during gastrulation."
