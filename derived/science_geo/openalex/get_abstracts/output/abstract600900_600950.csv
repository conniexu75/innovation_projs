https://openalex.org/W2773981699,"Breast cancer (BC) comprises multiple distinct subtypes that differ genetically, pathologically, and clinically. Here, we describe a robust protocol for long-term culturing of human mammary epithelial organoids. Using this protocol, >100 primary and metastatic BC organoid lines were generated, broadly recapitulating the diversity of the disease. BC organoid morphologies typically matched the histopathology, hormone receptor status, and HER2 status of the original tumor. DNA copy number variations as well as sequence changes were consistent within tumor-organoid pairs and largely retained even after extended passaging. BC organoids furthermore populated all major gene-expression-based classification groups and allowed in vitro drug screens that were consistent with in vivo xeno-transplantations and patient response. This study describes a representative collection of well-characterized BC organoids available for cancer research and drug development, as well as a strategy to assess in vitro drug response in a personalized fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2952602120,"Single-cell analysis of the adult human brain is facilitated by improved methods for RNA-seq and hypersensitive-site mapping. Detailed characterization of the cell types in the human brain requires scalable experimental approaches to examine multiple aspects of the molecular state of individual cells, as well as computational integration of the data to produce unified cell-state annotations. Here we report improved high-throughput methods for single-nucleus droplet-based sequencing (snDrop-seq) and single-cell transposome hypersensitive site sequencing (scTHS-seq). We used each method to acquire nuclear transcriptomic and DNA accessibility maps for >60,000 single cells from human adult visual cortex, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. Integration of these data revealed regulatory elements and transcription factors that underlie cell-type distinctions, providing a basis for the study of complex processes in the brain, such as genetic programs that coordinate adult remyelination. We also mapped disease-associated risk variants to specific cellular populations, which provided insights into normal and pathogenic cellular processes in the human brain. This integrative multi-omics approach permits more detailed single-cell interrogation of complex organs and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2774307122,"Droplet single-cell RNA-sequencing (dscRNA-seq) has enabled rapid, massively parallel profiling of transcriptomes. However, assessing differential expression across multiple individuals has been hampered by inefficient sample processing and technical batch effects. Here we describe a computational tool, demuxlet, that harnesses natural genetic variation to determine the sample identity of each droplet containing a single cell (singlet) and detect droplets containing two cells (doublets). These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments in which cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than in standard workflows. Using simulated data, we show that 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per cell are sufficient to assign 97% of singlets and identify 92% of doublets in pools of up to 64 individuals. Given genotyping data for each of eight pooled samples, demuxlet correctly recovers the sample identity of >99% of singlets and identifies doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. We apply demuxlet to assess cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in 8 pooled lupus patient samples treated with interferon (IFN)-β and perform eQTL analysis on 23 pooled samples."

Despite the fundamental importance of proper gene control to cell identity and development, the proteins that contribute to structural interactions between enhancers and promoters are poorly understood. There is considerable evidence that enhancer-promoter interactions can be facilitated by transcriptional cofactors such as Mediator, structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes such as cohesin, and DNA binding proteins such as CTCF. Mediator can physically bridge enhancer-bound transcription factors and the promoter-bound transcription apparatus (Allen and Taatjes, 2015Allen B.L. Taatjes D.J.

Constraining DNA interactions within CTCF-CTCF loop structures in this manner may facilitate proper enhancer-promoter contacts. Evidence that CTCF-CTCF interactions play important global roles in chromosome loop structures but are only occasionally directly involved in enhancer-promoter contacts (Phillips and Corces, 2009Phillips J.E. Corces V.G. CTCF: Master weaver of the genome.Cell. 2009; 137: 1194-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) led us to consider the possibility that a bridging protein analogous to CTCF might generally participate in enhancer-promoter interactions. We report here that Yin Yang 1 (YY1) contributes to enhancer-promoter interactions in a manner analogous to DNA looping mediated by CTCF. YY1 and CTCF share many features: both are essential, ubiquitously expressed, zinc-coordinating proteins that bind hypo-methylated DNA sequences, form homodimers, and thus facilitate loop formation. The two proteins differ in that YY1 preferentially occupies interacting enhancers and promoters, whereas CTCF preferentially occupies sites distal from these regulatory elements that tend to form larger loops and participate in insulation. Deletion of YY1 binding sites or depletion of YY1 can disrupt enhancer-promoter contacts and normal gene expression. Thus, YY1-mediated structuring of enhancer-promoter loops is analogous to CTCF-mediated structuring of TADs, CTCF contact domains, and insulated neighborhoods. This model of YY1-mediated structuring of enhancer-promoter loops accounts for diverse functions reported previously for YY1, including contributions to both gene activation and repression and to gene dysregulation in cancer. We sought to identify a protein factor that might contribute to enhancer-promoter interactions in a manner analogous to that of CTCF at insulators. Such a protein would be expected to bind active enhancers and promoters, be essential for cell viability, show ubiquitous expression, and be capable of dimerization. To identify proteins that bind active enhancers and promoters, we sought candidates from chromatin immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS), using antibodies directed toward histones with modifications characteristic of enhancer and promoter chromatin (H3K27ac and H3K4me3, respectively) (Creyghton et al., 2010Creyghton M.P. Cheng A.W. Welstead G.G. Kooistra T. Carey B.W. Steine E.J. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Frampton G.M.

USA. 2010; 107: 21931-21936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar), conducted previously in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (Ji et al., 2015Ji X. Dadon D.B. Abraham B.J. Lee T.I. Jaenisch R. Bradner J.E. Young R.A. Chromatin proteomic profiling reveals novel proteins associated with histone-marked genomic regions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 3841-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of 26 transcription factors that occupy both enhancers and promoters (Figure 1A), four (CTCF, YY1, NRF1, and ZBTB11) are essential based on a CRISPR cell-essentiality screen (Figure 1B) (Wang et al., 2015Wang T.

YY1 and CTCF share additional features: like CTCF, YY1 is a zinc-finger transcription factor (Klenova et al., 1993Klenova E.M. Nicolas R.H. Paterson H.F. Carne A.F. Heath C.M. Goodwin G.H.

The high-confidence YY1 interactions are depicted as red arcs, while high-confidence CTCF interactions are depicted as purple arcs. ChIP-seq binding profiles for YY1, CTCF, and H3K27ac, and stranded GRO-seq signal are displayed as reads per million per base pair at the Klf9 locus in mES cells. The Klf9 gene is indicated in the gene model and the interacting super-enhancers are labeled under the H3K27ac ChIP-seq track. (F) Metagene analysis showing the occupancy of YY1 at typical enhancer constituents and super-enhancer constituents. ChIP-seq profiles are shown in mean reads per million per base pair for elements of each class in a ± 2kb region centered on each region. To facilitate comparisons of the same factor between different regions the total ChIP-seq signal in the region was quantified and is displayed in the top right corner of the plot for each metagene analysis. The number of elements surveyed is listed at the top of the plot. Both plots are floored at the minimum amount of typical enhancer constituent signal. (G) Heatmaps displaying for each high-confidence YY1 interaction the number of PETs that support the interaction, for interactions that have at least one anchor overlapping a super-enhancer (left) and for interactions that have no ends overlapping a super-enhancer (right). Each row represents an interaction and the color intensity of each row represents the PET count for that interaction.

(I) Model depicting co-immunoprecipitation assay to detect YY1 dimerization. (J) Western blot results showing co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged YY1 and HA-tagged YY1 protein from nuclear lysates prepared from transfected cells. Interaction between FLAG-tagged YY1 and HA-tagged YY1 protein is observed, while interaction with OCT4 protein is not observed. The sources of the datasets used in this figure are listed in Table S4. If YY1 contributes to enhancer-promoter interactions, then chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) (Fullwood et al., 2009Fullwood M.J. Liu M.H. Pan Y.F. Liu J. Xu H.

Mei P.H. et al.An oestrogen-receptor-alpha-bound human chromatin interactome.Nature. 2009; 462: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) for YY1 should show that YY1 is preferentially associated with these interactions. CTCF ChIA-PET, in contrast, should show that CTCF is preferentially associated with insulator DNA interactions. We generated ChIA-PET data for YY1 and CTCF in mESCs and compared these two datasets. The results showed that the majority of YY1-associated interactions connect active regulatory elements (enhancer-enhancer, enhancer-promoter, and promoter-promoter, which we will henceforth call enhancer-promoter interactions), whereas the majority of CTCF-associated interactions connect insulator elements (Figures 1E and S1D). Some YY1-YY1 interactions involved simple enhancer-promoter contacts, as seen in the Raf1 locus (Figure 1F), and others involved more complex contacts among super-enhancer constituents and their target promoters, as seen in the Klf9 locus (Figure S1E). Super-enhancers were generally occupied by YY1 at relatively high densities and exhibited relatively high YY1-YY1 interaction frequencies (Figures S1E–S1H). For both YY1 and CTCF, there was also evidence of enhancer-insulator and promoter-insulator interactions, but these were more pronounced for CTCF (Figure S1D). Previous studies have reported that YY1 can form dimers (López-Perrote et al., 2014López-Perrote A. Alatwi H.E. Torreira E. Ismail A. Ayora S. Downs J.A. Llorca O.

https://openalex.org/W2772697618,"Current genome-editing systems generally rely on inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This may limit their utility in clinical therapies, as unwanted mutations caused by DSBs can have deleterious effects. CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been repurposed to enable target gene activation, allowing regulation of endogenous gene expression without creating DSBs. However, in vivo implementation of this gain-of-function system has proven difficult. Here, we report a robust system for in vivo activation of endogenous target genes through trans-epigenetic remodeling. The system relies on recruitment of Cas9 and transcriptional activation complexes to target loci by modified single guide RNAs. As proof-of-concept, we used this technology to treat mouse models of diabetes, muscular dystrophy, and acute kidney disease. Results demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated target gene activation can be achieved in vivo, leading to measurable phenotypes and amelioration of disease symptoms. This establishes new avenues for developing targeted epigenetic therapies against human diseases.Video Abstracthttps://www.cell.com/cms/asset/4dc4762c-5389-4d46-ae87-f4c10c221cdc/mmc2.mp4Loading ...(mp4, 30.23 MB) Download video"

https://openalex.org/W2774953329,"Layer-dependent fMRI allows measurements of information flow in cortical circuits, as afferent and efferent connections terminate in different cortical layers. However, it is unknown to what level human fMRI is specific and sensitive enough to reveal directional functional activity across layers. To answer this question, we developed acquisition and analysis methods for blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral-blood-volume (CBV)-based laminar fMRI and used these to discriminate four different tasks in the human motor cortex (M1). In agreement with anatomical data from animal studies, we found evidence for somatosensory and premotor input in superficial layers of M1 and for cortico-spinal motor output in deep layers. Laminar resting-state fMRI showed directional functional connectivity of M1 with somatosensory and premotor areas. Our findings demonstrate that CBV-fMRI can be used to investigate cortical activity in humans with unprecedented detail, allowing investigations of information flow between brain regions and outperforming conventional BOLD results that are often buried under vascular biases."
https://openalex.org/W2672878424,"Social behaviors are crucial to all mammals. Although the prelimbic cortex (PL, part of medial prefrontal cortex) has been implicated in social behavior, it is not clear which neurons are relevant or how they contribute. We found that PL contains anatomically and molecularly distinct subpopulations that target three downstream regions that have been implicated in social behavior: the nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala, and ventral tegmental area. Activation of NAc-projecting PL neurons (PL-NAc), but not the other subpopulations, decreased the preference for a social target. To determine what information PL-NAc neurons convey, we selectively recorded from them and found that individual neurons were active during social investigation, but only in specific spatial locations. Spatially specific manipulation of these neurons bidirectionally regulated the formation of a social-spatial association. Thus, the unexpected combination of social and spatial information within the PL-NAc may contribute to social behavior by supporting social-spatial learning."
https://openalex.org/W2775166823,"Cell-fate decisions remain poorly understood at the chromatin level. Here, we map chromatin remodeling dynamics during induction of pluripotent stem cells. ATAC-seq profiling of MEFs expressing Oct4-Sox2-Klf4 (OSK) reveals dynamic changes in chromatin states shifting from open to closed (OC) and closed to open (CO), with an initial burst of OC and an ending surge of CO. The OC loci are largely composed of genes associated with a somatic fate, while the CO loci are associated with pluripotency. Factors/conditions known to impede reprogramming prevent OSK-driven OC and skew OC-CO dynamics. While the CO loci are enriched for OSK motifs, the OC loci are not, suggesting alternative mechanisms for chromatin closing. Sap30, a Sin3A corepressor complex component, is required for the OC shift and facilitates reduced H3K27ac deposition at OC loci. These results reveal a chromatin accessibility logic during reprogramming that may apply to other cell-fate decisions."

https://openalex.org/W2772835320,"Development of biased ligands targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a promising approach for current drug discovery. Although structure-based drug design of biased agonists remains challenging even with an abundance of GPCR crystal structures, we present an approach for translating GPCR structural data into β-arrestin-biased ligands for aminergic GPCRs. We identified specific amino acid-ligand contacts at transmembrane helix 5 (TM5) and extracellular loop 2 (EL2) responsible for Gi/o and β-arrestin signaling, respectively, and targeted those residues to develop biased ligands. For these ligands, we found that bias is conserved at other aminergic GPCRs that retain similar residues at TM5 and EL2. Our approach provides a template for generating arrestin-biased ligands by modifying predicted ligand interactions that block TM5 interactions and promote EL2 interactions. This strategy may facilitate the structure-guided design of arrestin-biased ligands at other GPCRs, including polypharmacological biased ligands."

https://openalex.org/W2774231102,"Two complementary coiled-coil peptides and a bacterial microcompartment shell protein are combined to construct cytoscaffolds within Escherichia coli cells. Targeting enzymes to the cytoplasmic scaffold results in colocalization and improved metabolic flux. We have developed a system for producing a supramolecular scaffold that permeates the entire Escherichia coli cytoplasm. This cytoscaffold is constructed from a three-component system comprising a bacterial microcompartment shell protein and two complementary de novo coiled-coil peptides. We show that other proteins can be targeted to this intracellular filamentous arrangement. Specifically, the enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase have been directed to the filaments, leading to enhanced ethanol production in these engineered bacterial cells compared to those that do not produce the scaffold. This is consistent with improved metabolic efficiency through enzyme colocation. Finally, the shell-protein scaffold can be directed to the inner membrane of the cell, demonstrating how synthetic cellular organization can be coupled with spatial optimization through in-cell protein design. The cytoscaffold has potential in the development of next-generation cell factories, wherein it could be used to organize enzyme pathways and metabolite transporters to enhance metabolic flux."
https://openalex.org/W2775518302,"Cleavage of membrane-anchored proteins by ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) endopeptidases plays a key role in a wide variety of biological signal transduction and protein turnover processes. Among ADAM family members, ADAM10 stands out as particularly important because it is both responsible for regulated proteolysis of Notch receptors and catalyzes the non-amyloidogenic α-secretase cleavage of the Alzheimer's precursor protein (APP). We present here the X-ray crystal structure of the ADAM10 ectodomain, which, together with biochemical and cellular studies, reveals how access to the enzyme active site is regulated. The enzyme adopts an unanticipated architecture in which the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain partially occludes the enzyme active site, preventing unfettered substrate access. Binding of a modulatory antibody to the cysteine-rich domain liberates the catalytic domain from autoinhibition, enhancing enzymatic activity toward a peptide substrate. Together, these studies reveal a mechanism for regulation of ADAM activity and offer a roadmap for its modulation."

Shotgun metagenomics methods enable characterization of microbial communities in human microbiome and environmental samples. Assembly of metagenome sequences does not output whole genomes, so computational binning methods have been developed to cluster sequences into genome 'bins'. These methods exploit sequence composition, species abundance, or chromosome organization but cannot fully distinguish closely related species and strains. We present a binning method that incorporates bacterial DNA methylation signatures, which are detected using single-molecule real-time sequencing. Our method takes advantage of these endogenous epigenetic barcodes to resolve individual reads and assembled contigs into species- and strain-level bins. We validate our method using synthetic and real microbiome sequences. In addition to genome binning, we show that our method links plasmids and other mobile genetic elements to their host species in a real microbiome sample. Incorporation of DNA methylation information into shotgun metagenomics analyses will complement existing methods to enable more accurate sequence binning."
https://openalex.org/W2774778980,"Myofibroblasts participate in physiological wound healing and pathological fibrosis. Myofibroblast differentiation is characterized by the expression of α-smooth muscle actin and extracellular matrix proteins and is dependent on metabolic reprogramming. In this study, we explored the role of glutaminolysis and metabolites of TCA in supporting myofibroblast differentiation. Glutaminolysis converts Gln into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a critical intermediate in the TCA cycle. Increases in the steady-state concentrations of TCA cycle metabolites including α-KG, succinate, fumarate, malate, and citrate were observed in TGF-β1–differentiated myofibroblasts. The concentration of glutamate was also increased in TGF-β1–differentiated myofibroblasts compared with controls, whereas glutamine levels were decreased, suggesting enhanced glutaminolysis. This was associated with TGF-β1–induced expression of the glutaminase (GLS) isoform, GLS1, which converts Gln into glutamate, at both the mRNA and protein levels. The stimulation of GLS1 expression by TGF-β1 was dependent on both SMAD3 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Depletion of extracellular Gln prevented TGF-β1–induced myofibroblast differentiation. The removal of extracellular Gln postmyofibroblast differentiation decreased the expression of the profibrotic markers fibronectin and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and reversed TGF-β1–induced metabolic reprogramming. Silencing of GLS1 expression, in the presence of Gln, abrogated TGF-β1–induced expression of profibrotic markers. Treatment of GLS1-deficient myofibroblasts with exogenous glutamate or α-KG restored TGF-β1–induced expression of profibrotic markers in GLS1-deficient myofibroblasts. Together, these data demonstrate that glutaminolysis is a critical component of myofibroblast metabolic reprogramming that regulates myofibroblast differentiation."

Total plasma cholesterol reduction in populations suffering from primary hypercholesterolemia may lower CHD incidence. This study investigated the cholesterol reducing capacity of Lactobacillus plantarum ECGC 13110402, a strain selected for its high bile salt hydrolase activity, in 49 normal to mildly hypercholesterolaemic adults. Primary efficacy outcomes included effect on blood lipids (total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoproteins (LDL-C), high density lipoproteins (HDL-C) and triacylgycerides (TAG), inflammatory biomarkers and occurrence/severity of gastrointestinal side effects to establish safety and tolerance of the intervention. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure, immune biomarkers, gut microbiota characterisation and metabonome changes. The study was run in a parallel, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised design in which the active group ingested 2x109 CFU encapsulated Lactobacillus plantarum ECGC 13110402 twice daily. Daily ingestion of the active treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in LDL-C in volunteers with baseline TC<5mM during the 0-12 week period (13.9%, P = 0.030), a significant reduction in TC in volunteers with baseline TC≥6mM in the 0-6 week period (37.6%, P = 0.045), a significant decrease in TAG (53.9% P = 0.030) and an increase in HDL-C (14.7%, P = 0.007) in the over 60 years population in the 6-12 week period. A statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure was also observed across the active study group in the 6-12-week period (6.6%, P = 0.003). No impact on gastrointestinal function and side effects was observed during the study. Similar to blood and urine metabonomic analyses, faecal metagenomics did not reveal significant changes upon active or placebo intake.

https://openalex.org/W2772414594,"Somatic cell reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) induces changes in genome architecture reflective of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) state. However, only a small minority of cells typically transition to pluripotency, which has limited our understanding of the process. Here, we characterize the DNA regulatory landscape during reprogramming by time-course profiling of isolated sub-populations of intermediates poised to become iPSCs. Widespread reconfiguration of chromatin states and transcription factor (TF) occupancy occurs early during reprogramming, and cells that fail to reprogram partially retain their original chromatin states. A second wave of reconfiguration occurs just prior to pluripotency acquisition, where a majority of early changes revert to the somatic cell state and many of the changes that define the pluripotent state become established. Our comprehensive characterization of reprogramming-associated molecular changes broadens our understanding of this process and sheds light on how TFs access and change the chromatin during cell-fate transitions."

Analysis of correlated mutations revealed that the substrate-binding and copper-containing surface of LPMO10s composes a network of co-evolved residues and interactions, whose roles in LPMO functionality are unclear. Here, we mutated a subset of these correlated residues in a newly characterized C1/C4-oxidizing LPMO10 from Micromonospora aurantiaca (MaLPMO10B) to the corresponding residues in strictly C1-oxidizing LPMO10s. We found that surface properties near the catalytic copper, i.e. side chains likely to be involved in substrate positioning, are major determinants of the C1:C4 ratio. Several MaLPMO10B mutants almost completely lost C4-oxidizing activity while maintaining C1-oxidizing activity. These mutants also lost chitin-oxidizing activity, which is typically observed for C1/C4-oxidizing, but not for C1-oxidizing, cellulose-active LPMO10s.

All hitherto characterized chitin-active LPMO10s oxidize exclusively the C1-carbon atom, whereas those that act on cellulosic substrates have been shown to either exclusively oxidize the C1 position or generate a mixture of C1- and C4-oxidized products (25Forsberg Z.

Furthermore, LPMO10s that can oxidize both the C1- and the C4-carbon in cellulose are also capable of oxidizing the C1-carbon in chitin (25Forsberg Z. Mackenzie A.K. Sørlie M. Røhr Å.K. Helland R.

LPMOs that oxidize the non-reducing end (C4-oxidizers) produce 4-ketoaldoses (Glc4KGlcn) that are spontaneously hydrated to their corresponding gemdiol (Glc4GemGlcn) form (Fig. 1) (20Isaksen T.

Although members of different LPMO families share low sequence identity, their structural resemblance is conspicuous. The pyramidal core structure of LPMOs consists of a distorted β-sandwich comprising two β-sheets that are connected by a varying number of loops and helices. The surface-exposed active site is part of a flat substrate-binding surface (2Quinlan R.J. Sweeney M.D. Lo Leggio L. Otten H. Poulsen J.C. Johansen K.S. Krogh K.B. Jørgensen C.I. Tovborg M.

Because this copper site is conserved in all types of LPMOs, variation in enzyme performance, substrate specificity, and oxidative regioselectivity must be driven by variation in surrounding amino acids that constitute the binding surface. In LPMO10s, the substrate-binding surface is made up of 20–30 amino acids covering an area of ∼30 by 40 Å (29Hemsworth G.R. Taylor E.J. Kim R.Q. Gregory R.C. Lewis S.J. Turkenburg J.P. Parkin A.

This finding correlates well with the fact that this loop is lacking in LPMO9s that exclusively oxidize C1, but it is more intriguing when considering that strictly C4-oxidizing LPMO9s also lack this loop. It seems that other determinants for oxidative regioselectivity are still to be discovered. On this note, Danneels et al. (32Danneels B. Tanghe M. Joosten H.J. Gundinger T. Spadiut O. Stals I. Desmet T. A quantitative indicator diagram for lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases reveals the role of aromatic surface residues in HjLPMO9A regioselectivity.PLoS One. 2017; 12 (28562644): e017844610.1371/journal.pone.0178446Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) recently showed that aromatic residues on the surface of LPMO9s affect oxidative regioselectivity. In this study, we have compared sequences of LPMO10s that oxidize cellulose at either the C1 or at the C1- and C4-carbons. Surface-exposed residues identified by correlated mutation analysis (33Kuipers R.K. Joosten H.J. Verwiel E. Paans S. Akerboom J. van der Oost J. Leferink N.G. van Berkel W.J. Vriend G. Schaap P.J.

As part of these studies aimed at identifying structural determinants of LPMO functionality and focusing on oxidative regioselectivity, a previously uncharacterized LPMO10 from the bacterium Micromonospora aurantiaca (MaLPMO10B), with predicted mixed C1/C4 activity, was structurally and functionally characterized, including an assessment of the role of its family 2 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM2). Apart from unraveling determinants of oxidative regioselectivity, these site-directed mutagenesis studies provide some insight into the structural determinants of substrate specificity. This study also reveals mutational effects on enzyme stability that are likely related to changes in the rate of production and consumption of H2O2. Facing the scarcity of regioselectivity-related mutagenesis data, we set out to harness information given by natural sequence diversity, focusing on co-evolved residues that could be involved in the divergence between C1-specific and C1/C4-oxidizing cellulose-active LPMO10s. A sequence analysis was carried out with 54 sequences (Table S1) putatively encoding for the C1-specific and the C1/C4-oxidizing cellulose-active LPMO10s (Fig. 2). The global analysis pipeline consisted of the following steps: 1) retrieving the sequences from a larger phylogenetic analysis performed in-house that included all substrate specificities within the AA10 family (i.e. chitin and cellulose; see Fig. S1); 2) performing a structure-guided multiple sequence alignment (MSA); 3) carrying out a correlated mutation analysis (CMA (33Kuipers R.K.

The phylogenetic tree generated in step 1 (Fig. S1) shows two distinct subgroups corresponding to C1-specific and C1/C4-oxidizing cellulose-active LPMO10s. ScLPMO10C (also known as CelS2) and ScLPMO10B are well-studied (25Forsberg Z. Mackenzie A.K. Sørlie M. Røhr Å.K. Helland R. Arvai A.S. Vaaje-Kolstad G. Eijsink V.G.

https://openalex.org/W2775377849,"The balance between self-renewal and differentiation ensures long-term maintenance of stem cell (SC) pools in regenerating epithelial tissues. This balance is challenged during periods of high regenerative pressure and is often compromised in aged animals. Here, we show that target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling is a key regulator of SC loss during repeated regenerative episodes. In response to regenerative stimuli, SCs in the intestinal epithelium of the fly and in the tracheal epithelium of mice exhibit transient activation of TOR signaling. Although this activation is required for SCs to rapidly proliferate in response to damage, repeated rounds of damage lead to SC loss. Consistently, age-related SC loss in the mouse trachea and in muscle can be prevented by pharmacologic or genetic inhibition, respectively, of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. These findings highlight an evolutionarily conserved role of TOR signaling in SC function and identify repeated rounds of mTORC1 activation as a driver of age-related SC decline."

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation has been used to treat malignant hematologic diseases for over 50 years. During this time, its therapeutic potential has expanded to non-malignant hematologic and immunologic disorders. With the emergence of gene therapy strategies and reduced toxicity conditioning regimens, hematopoietic transplantation is poised to expand to additional patient populations. Successful transplantation requires harvesting of hematopoietic stem cells in both sufficient number and quality for robust engraftment, blood cell recovery, and lifelong maintenance of hematopoiesis. The predominant source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplant is mobilized peripheral blood (D’Souza et al., 2017D’Souza A. Lee S. Zhu X. Pasquini M.

Repeated, prolonged sessions of apheresis are particularly common among autologous donors and cause increased patient distress, tie up clinical resources, and increase the cost (Hosing et al., 2011Hosing C. Smith V. Rhodes B. Walters K. Thompson R. Qazilbash M. Khouri I. de Lima M. Balzer R.J.

Enhancing the standard of care for stem cell collection offers an opportunity not only to improve treatment of those who respond poorly to mobilization by G-CSF, but also to expand autologous and allogeneic transplants across the full array of diseases that can potentially be cured. With the goal of developing a new mobilization regimen to overcome the shortcomings of the current standard of care, we began exploring an N-terminal 4-amino acid truncated form of the human chemokine GROβ. This molecule specifically binds to the CXCR2 receptor and with greater potency than full-length GROβ (King et al., 2000King A.G. Johanson K. Frey C.L. DeMarsh P.L. White J.R. McDevitt P. McNulty D. Balcarek J. Jonak Z.L. Bhatnagar P.K. Pelus L.M. Identification of unique truncated KC/GRO beta chemokines with potent hematopoietic and anti-infective activities.J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3774-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This truncated form is used throughout this manuscript and is simply referred to as GROβ. We previously showed that GROβ rapidly mobilizes hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in mice (King et al., 2001King A.G. Horowitz D. Dillon S.B. Levin R. Farese A.M. MacVittie T.J. Pelus L.M.

Horowitz D. Dillon S.B. Levin R. Farese A.M. MacVittie T.J. Pelus L.M.

Based on these animal studies, we performed a single-blind, dose escalating pilot study in humans to assess the tolerability and preliminary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics following intravenous (i.v.) administration of GROβ in healthy volunteers. All subjects received matched placebo in the first session and a dose of GROβ in the second session, separated by at least 4 weeks. GROβ had no adverse effects on clinical laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac output, vital signs, or lung function and was not antigenic in the population studied. Infusion of GROβ at doses ≥90 μg/kg resulted in reported acute lumbar region mid-line back pain, with a maximum tolerated dose of 200 μg/kg. Back pain was reported in 11 subjects (29.7%) following infusion with GROβ compared to 2 subjects (5.3%) receiving placebo and generally resolved without stopping drug infusion within 10 min. No other serious adverse events were reported. In subjects receiving doses ≥60 μg/kg, a modest but significant increase in peripheral CD34+ cell counts, a phenotypic measure of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, was observed compared to matched placebos (Figure 1A). The maximal CD34+ cell count measured was achieved following administration of GROβ in all but one subject (Figure 1B). Although GROβ was well tolerated in humans, the magnitude of mobilization was not expected to be sufficient for clinical harvesting. We previously reported that administration of GROβ following a standard G-CSF regimen increases mobilization in mice. However, this strategy would still require multi-day administration of G-CSF and thus would not be expected to substantially alter standard of care. Single administration with rapid mobilization kinetics would be more ideal. The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (Plerixafor) is approved for clinical mobilization and is used in combination with G-CSF, often when G-CSF has failed to mobilize sufficient numbers of CD34+ cells. Administration of AMD3100 as a standalone agent has been explored in some patient and donor populations (Devine et al., 2008Devine S.M. Vij R. Rettig M. Todt L. McGlauchlen K. Fisher N. Devine H. Link D.C. Calandra G. Bridger G. et al.Rapid mobilization of functional donor hematopoietic cells without G-CSF using AMD3100, an antagonist of the CXCR4/SDF-1 interaction.Blood. 2008; 112: 990-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, Pantin et al., 2017Pantin J.

However, the level of mobilization is below that of G-CSF. With our experience in the healthy volunteer study, we returned to laboratory mouse models to explore the efficacy of a combinatorial strategy using GROβ and AMD3100. In mouse models, the peak mobilization produced by subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of AMD3100 was approximately 1 hr post-treatment (Broxmeyer et al., 2005Broxmeyer H.E. Orschell C.M. Clapp D.W. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Plett P.A. Liles W.C. Li X. Graham-Evans B. Campbell T.B. et al.Rapid mobilization of murine and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) and GROβ peaked within 15 min (King et al., 2001King A.G. Horowitz D. Dillon S.B. Levin R. Farese A.M. MacVittie T.J. Pelus L.M. Rapid mobilization of murine hematopoietic stem cells with enhanced engraftment properties and evaluation of hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization in rhesus monkeys by a single injection of SB-251353, a specific truncated form of the human CXC chemokine GRObeta.Blood. 2001; 97: 1534-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first administered AMD3100, waited for 45 min, and then administered GROβ, with blood analysis 15 min later (Figure 2A). We hypothesized that this dosing strategy would provide peak mobilization for both agents, giving us the maximal response. However, contrary to this hypothesis, we saw no increase in mobilization over GROβ alone. We then altered our strategy and administered both agents simultaneously. Using this simultaneous dosing regimen, peak mobilization was seen within 15 min (Figure 2B; Hoggatt and Pelus, 2012Hoggatt J. Pelus L.M. Hematopoietic stem cell mobilization with agents other than G-CSF.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 904: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar). While each agent given alone had less mobilization than a standard regimen of G-CSF (Figure 2C), the simultaneous combination of GROβ+AMD3100 resulted in significantly greater mobilization than seen with the standard multi-day G-CSF regimen (Figure 2C). Given that peak mobilization following GROβ+AMD3100 occurred within 15 min, mimicking the kinetics of GROβ alone, we hypothesized that the mechanism driving this enhanced mobilization was an enhancement of the GROβ mechanism. We previously demonstrated that GROβ mobilization is mediated by matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (King et al., 2001King A.G. Horowitz D. Dillon S.B. Levin R. Farese A.M. MacVittie T.J. Pelus L.M. Rapid mobilization of murine hematopoietic stem cells with enhanced engraftment properties and evaluation of hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization in rhesus monkeys by a single injection of SB-251353, a specific truncated form of the human CXC chemokine GRObeta.Blood. 2001; 97: 1534-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Pelus et al., 2004Pelus L.M. Bian H. King A.G. Fukuda S. Neutrophil-derived MMP-9 mediates synergistic mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by the combination of G-CSF and the chemokines GRObeta/CXCL2 and GRObetaT/CXCL2delta4.Blood. 2004; 103: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As seen previously, GROβ increased peripheral blood MMP-9 as measured by zymography (Figure 3A), and in addition we now also show similar results measured by ELISA (Figures 3B–3D). The combination of GROβ+AMD3100 substantially increased MMP-9 levels (Figures 3A–3D), compared to either agent used alone. Changes in plasma levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), an endogenous inhibitor of MMP-9, were not seen after administration of any agents (Figure 3C), nor were there significant changes in bone marrow levels (data not shown). We next assessed peripheral MMP-9 over a 24-hr period post-administration. Peak MMP-9 levels were seen within 5–15 min after the combination regimen (Figure 3E) and rapidly returned to baseline within 12 hr. Importantly, the kinetics of peripheral MMP-9 release matched the kinetics of mobilization (Figure 3F). Analysis of numerous independent experiments encompassing 112 individual mice, representing a variety of mouse strains and genetic variants (described in later sections), demonstrated a strong correlation between progenitor cells mobilized to peripheral blood and plasma MMP-9 levels following GROβ or combination treatment (Figure 3G). These results suggest that the mechanism of action of the combinatorial regimen may be like that of GROβ alone and be dependent on MMP-9. Based on the rapid kinetics and the strong correlation of MMP-9 with hematopoietic mobilization, we hypothesized that GROβ and AMD3100 acted through their respective CXCR2 and CXCR4 receptors on neutrophils, resulting in enhanced MMP-9 release. This hypothesis is represented in Figure 4A. We based this hypothesis on our earlier findings with GROβ as a single agent, the large amounts of MMP-9 stored in neutrophil granules making them the logical source, the role of these receptors in differentially regulating neutrophil trafficking (Eash et al., 2010Eash K.J. Greenbaum A.M. Gopalan P.K. Link D.C. CXCR2 and CXCR4 antagonistically regulate neutrophil trafficking from murine bone marrow.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 2423-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and, importantly, the presence of high levels of CXCR2 receptor on neutrophils, while relatively absent on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (Figure S1). To demonstrate the role of neutrophils in mobilization, we treated mice with an anti-Gr-1 antibody to deplete neutrophils (Figure S2). Significant mobilization was seen with the combinatorial regimen compared to either agent alone in isotype-treated mice (Figure 4B), whereas neutrophil depletion resulted in a complete absence of GROβ-mediated mobilization and dramatically decreased mobilization from the combination regimen. In contrast, mobilization with AMD3100 was unaffected by neutrophil depletion.Figure S1Analysis of CXCR2 Surface Expression, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Cell surface staining for CXCR2 (CD182) clone E1 (upper) and clone G4 (lower).

Shown are PMN counts, mean ± SEM of N = 6 mice per group. To demonstrate the role of CXCR4 in the combined response, we used conditional CXCR4 knockout mice as we have previously described (Hoggatt et al., 2013Hoggatt J. Mohammad K.S. Singh P. Hoggatt A.F. Chitteti B.R. Speth J.M. Hu P. Poteat B.A. Stilger K.N. Ferraro F. et al.Differential stem- and progenitor-cell trafficking by prostaglandin E2.Nature. 2013; 495: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Conditional deletion of CXCR4 on its own resulted in mobilization (Figure 4C). GROβ administration resulted in significantly more mobilization than in wild-type mice. In this case, the conditional deletion of CXCR4 replaces the effect of AMD3100, resulting in enhanced mobilization. However, AMD3100 did not mobilize in knockout mice, as expected given its known target. Similarly, there was no additional mobilization with the combination of GROβ+AMD3100 in knockout mice compared to GROβ alone. Likewise, CXCR2 gene deletion significantly reduced mobilization to GROβ (Figure 4D) and prevented any additional mobilization over AMD3100 alone when used in combination. To confirm the role of MMP-9, we used two approaches. First, we mobilized MMP-9 knockout mice and compared them to wild-type controls. Mice deficient in MMP-9 failed to mobilize in response to GROβ (Figure 4E). Mobilization to AMD3100 was unaffected, demonstrating that MMP-9 is not a primary mechanism of AMD3100 on its own. Importantly, there was no additional mobilization with the combination regimen, demonstrating the necessity of MMP-9 for the GROβ+AMD3100 regimen. To further verify, we used an antibody neutralization approach. Mice were given a neutralizing antibody for MMP-9 2 hr prior to treatment, and mobilization was compared to isotype-treated controls. As was the case with MMP-9 knockout mice, there was no mobilization in response to GROβ (Figure 4F). Mobilization to AMD3100 as a single agent was unaffected, and there was no additional mobilization with the combination regimen. The totality of these studies using genetic knockout mice and antibody approaches confirm the model hypothesized (Figure 4A). The rapid mobilization elicited by GROβ+AMD3100 is the result of an agonist effect of GROβ on neutrophil CXCR2 coincident with antagonism of CXCR4 by AMD3100, resulting in release of MMP-9 and subsequent hematopoietic mobilization. The mouse studies described in Figure 4 suggested a crosstalk between the CXCR2 and CXCR4 receptors in neutrophils. Signaling from the CXCR4 receptor appeared to dampen CXCR2-mediated mobilization. To further explore this crosstalk, we utilized freshly harvested human neutrophils and treated them ex vivo with GROβ and AMD3100. Human neutrophils were used in these studies with an eye toward clinical translation of the rapid mobilization regimen but also out of practicality to acquire sufficient numbers for signaling analysis. In preliminary studies, however, mouse peripheral and marrow neutrophils demonstrated similar responses to GROβ and AMD3100 as human neutrophils (data not shown). Signaling downstream of both CXCR2 and CXCR4 receptors is known to cause intracellular calcium mobilization (Duda et al., 2011Duda D.G. Kozin S.V. Kirkpatrick N.D. Xu L. Fukumura D. Jain R.K. CXCL12 (SDF1alpha)-CXCR4/CXCR7 pathway inhibition: An emerging sensitizer for anticancer therapies?.Clin. Cancer Res. 2011; 17: 2074-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, Waugh and Wilson, 2008Waugh D.J. Wilson C. The interleukin-8 pathway in cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 6735-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Human neutrophils treated with GROβ or SDF-1, the ligand for CXCR4, had an increase in calcium mobilization (Figure 5A, left panel). However, when the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 was added, the calcium mobilization response to SDF-1 was blocked (Figure 5A, right panel). In contrast, GROβ+AMD3100 resulted in increased calcium mobilization over GROβ alone, demonstrating enhanced G-protein signaling after the combination. We then pre-treated human neutrophils with pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gαi, or mastoparan, an activator of Gαi signaling. The CXCR4 receptor is capable of activating Gαi and previously shown to be pertussis toxin sensitive (Juremalm et al., 2000Juremalm M. Hjertson M. Olsson N. Harvima I. Nilsson K. Nilsson G. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is expressed within the mast cell lineage and its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha acts as a mast cell chemotaxin.Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3614-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). GROβ treatment of neutrophils increased the release of active MMP-9, as measured by zymography (Figure 5B), and closely matched the molar ratio of MMP-9 and its inhibitor TIMP-1, as measured by ELISA (Figure 5C). When neutrophils were pre-treated with pertussis toxin there was a significant increase in MMP-9 release after GROβ treatment (Figures 5B and 5C). In this case, the inhibition of G-protein signaling mimics the effect of AMD3100, i.e., blocking CXCR4 signaling enhances the GROβ-mediated release of MMP-9. Similarly, mastoparan, which activates Gαi signaling and thus mimics CXCR4 agonism, blocked the GROβ-mediated release of MMP-9 (Figures 5B and 5C). In contrast, cholera toxin, which is an activator of Gαs signaling, had no effect (Figures 5D and 5E), validating the role of Gαi signaling pathways in the response. To further determine the potential regulators of the combination regimen, we pre-treated human neutrophils with signaling pathway inhibitors prior to treatment with GROβ, AMD3100, or the combination. Inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling with SB203580 (Figure 5F), or JAK2 with AG490 (Figure 5G), had no effect on GROβ-mediated release of MMP-9, or the enhanced release in response to the combination treatment. Pre-treatment with PI3K inhibitors, Wortmannin or LY294002, resulted in an increase in GROβ-mediated release of MMP-9 (Figures 5H and 5I, respectively), to a similar degree as combination treatment. Similarly, blockade of MEK1 signaling by PD98059 partially mimicked the effect of AMD3100. Distinct from the effects of these inhibitors in mimicking AMD3100, the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 blocked GROβ-mediated release of MMP-9 as well as the enhanced release from the combination regimen (Figure 5K). This result suggests that Src family kinases are a key signaling pathway downstream of CXCR2 governing MMP-9 release. The donor and patient pool for hematopoietic mobilization is diverse, and the clinical experience with G-CSF has shown broad ranges in the ability to mobilize between individual donors (Vasu et al., 2008Vasu S. Leitman S.F. Tisdale J.F. Hsieh M.M. Childs R.W. Barrett A.J. Fowler D.H. Bishop M.R. Kang E.M. Malech H.L. et al.Donor demographic and laboratory predictors of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell mobilization in an ethnically diverse population.Blood. 2008; 112: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Prior reports in mice have also shown differences in the capacity to mobilize in response to G-CSF or cyclophosphamide (Roberts et al., 1997Roberts A.W. Foote S. Alexander W.S. Scott C. Robb L. Metcalf D. Genetic influences determining progenitor cell mobilization and leukocytosis induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.Blood. 1997; 89: 2736-2744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Watters et al., 2003Watters J.W. Kloss E.F. Link D.C. Graubert T.A. McLeod H.L. A mouse-based strategy for cyclophosphamide pharmacogenomic discovery.J. Appl. Physiol. 2003; 95: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We assessed mobilization in C57BL/6, DBA/2, or their F1 hybrid (BDF1). Mobilization with GROβ or the combination treatment was significantly greater in DBA/2, compared to C57BL/6 mice (Figure 6A), while mobilization with AMD3100 did not differ among the strains. This result suggested that the strain differences were predominantly due to a GROβ-related mechanism. Indeed, when we assessed blood plasma levels for MMP-9 activity, DBA/2 mice exhibited more activity after GROβ or combination treatment than did C57BL/6 mice (Figure 6B). To further explore this differential mobilization, and to account for other potential differences in the bone marrow niche or vasculature, we performed similar experiments in chimeric mice. Lethally irradiated BDF1 mice were transplanted with DBA/2, C57BL/6, or BDF1 bone marrow. In these mice, the microenvironment was the same and only the hematopoietic system differed. As we showed previously, DBA/2 mice had greater mobilization to GROβ and the combination of GROβ+AMD3100 than C57BL/6 mice (Figure 6C). Similarly, DBA/2 chimeric mice demonstrated greater mobilization than C57BL/6 chimeras (Figure 6D). These results demonstrate that the strain differences in mobilization response to GROβ are due to differences in the hematopoietic system. There are numerous genetic differences among strains of mice that could account for the differing mobilization response. However, given that the differences in our experiments seemed to be GROβ dependent, as mouse strains did not differ in mobilization to AMD3100, coupled with the increased MMP-9 activity in the DBA/2 mice (Figure 6B), and the clear constraint to the hematopoietic system (Figure 6D), we hypothesized that the difference in mobilization to the combination regimen was mediated by genetic variation in MMP-9.

In this study, rats with cerebral I/R injury were induced by a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h, followed by reperfusion. The male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups, including the sham-operated, vehicle-treated, 10 mg/kg HHC-treated, 20 mg/kg HHC-treated, and 40 mg/kg HHC-treated I/R groups. The animals were immediately injected with HHC by an intraperitoneal administration at the onset of cerebral reperfusion. After 24 h of reperfusion, the rats were tested for neurological deficits, and the pathology of the brain was studied by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. In addition, the brain tissues were prepared for protein extraction for Western blot analysis, a malondialdehyde (MDA) assay, a nitric oxide (NO) assay, a superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay, a glutathione (GSH) assay, and a glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) assay. The data revealed that the neurological deficit scores and the infarct volume were significantly reduced in the HHC-treated rats at all doses compared to the vehicle group. Treatment with HHC significantly attenuated oxidative stress and inflammation, with a decreased level of MDA and NO and a decreased expression of NF-κB (p65) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the I/R rats. HHC also evidently increased Nrf2 (nucleus) protein expression, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expression, the antioxidative enzymes, and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Moreover, the HHC treatment also significantly decreased apoptosis, with a decrease in Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and an increase in Bcl-XL, which was in accordance with a decrease in the apoptotic neuronal cells. Therefore, the HHC treatment protects the brain from cerebral I/R injury by diminishing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. The antioxidant properties of HHC may play an important role in improving functional outcomes and may offer significant neuroprotection against I/R damage."

This sensory feedback needs to be selectively modulated in a task- and context-dependent manner. Here, we show that inhibitory interneurons (INs) expressing the RORβ orphan nuclear receptor gate sensory feedback to the spinal motor system during walking and are required for the production of a fluid locomotor rhythm. Genetic manipulations that abrogate inhibitory RORβ IN function result in an ataxic gait characterized by exaggerated flexion movements and marked alterations to the step cycle. Inactivation of RORβ in inhibitory neurons leads to reduced presynaptic inhibition and changes to sensory-evoked reflexes, arguing that the RORβ inhibitory INs function to suppress the sensory transmission pathways that activate flexor motor reflexes and interfere with the ongoing locomotor program.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI1MzMzMzg1MTBiYzVjNTFiM2E1ZWU0MDZmMGRlOTJmZiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MDE1MjE2fQ.Jopp01rVtEuf9psKq_QnjQGhg6iVbeSMWsDrww4YTdj7CTHrtDHfpcnXu0dgCEWHloAQHobHYqlpbHvZuhtGyZOVgti87cVCmq_ntpmTQlQB6VQLUm4kmRNVBxTciaB2JUYzqcJygHmEiG_sIhIsKHiYWToiNthDXzlZBBtux0CG2JHIkpbz5MQw--N5BDo4lwCmOKN5yBa4zqaYrcCU9N4YEbbyOxGHQEOZM1cFqIEPZPi9hnmUq1YcqKJ2t6dKdf_txZME7Ac1aNUOwjsDLXkBer94EvA_HX0cRs9NtRmzdccoM-KM1R_dVML4FGSJvpPpp7Bm9SQXhmOk5k5h9A(mp4, (51.19 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2774342205,"Defective nucleotide modifications of mitochondrial tRNAs have been associated with several human diseases, but their pathophysiology remains poorly understood. In this report, we investigated the pathogenic molecular mechanism underlying a hypertension-associated 4435A→G mutation in mitochondrial tRNAMet The m.4435A→G mutation affected a highly conserved adenosine at position 37, 3' adjacent to the tRNA's anticodon, which is important for the fidelity of codon recognition and stabilization. We hypothesized that the m.4435A→G mutation introduced an m1G37 modification of tRNAMet, altering its structure and function. Primer extension and methylation activity assays indeed confirmed that the m.4435A→G mutation created a tRNA methyltransferase 5 (TRMT5)-catalyzed m1G37 modification of tRNAMet We found that this mutation altered the tRNAMet structure, indicated by an increased melting temperature and electrophoretic mobility of the mutated tRNA compared with the wildtype molecule. We demonstrated that cybrid cell lines carrying the m.4435A→G mutation exhibited significantly decreased efficiency in aminoacylation and steady-state levels of tRNAMet, as compared with those of control cybrids. The aberrant tRNAMet metabolism resulted in variable decreases in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded polypeptides in the mutant cybrids. Furthermore, we found that the m.4435A→G mutation caused respiratory deficiency, markedly diminished mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potential, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species in mutant cybrids. These results demonstrated that an aberrant m1G37 modification of mitochondrial tRNAMet affected the structure and function of its tRNA and consequently altered mitochondrial function. Our findings provide critical insights into the pathophysiology of maternally inherited hypertension, which is manifested by the deficient tRNA nucleotide modification."
https://openalex.org/W2773621067,"Executive control involves the ability to flexibly inhibit or change an action when it is contextually inappropriate. Using the complimentary techniques of human fMRI and monkey electrophysiology in a context-dependent stop signal task, we found a functional double dissociation between the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) and the bi-lateral frontal eye field (FEF). Different regions of rVLPFC were associated with context-based signal meaning versus intention to inhibit a response, while FEF activity corresponded to success or failure of the response inhibition regardless of the stimulus response mapping or the context. These results were validated by electrophysiological recordings in rVLPFC and FEF from one monkey. Inhibition of a planned behavior is therefore likely not governed by a single brain system as had been previously proposed, but instead depends on two distinct neural processes involving different sub-regions of the rVLPFC and their interactions with other motor-related brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2773212167,"When trained monkeys discriminate the temporal structure of two sequential vibrotactile stimuli, dorsal premotor cortex (DPC) showed high heterogeneity among its neuronal responses. Notably, DPC neurons coded stimulus patterns as broader categories and signaled them during working memory, comparison, and postponed decision periods. Here, we show that such population activity can be condensed into two major coding components: one that persistently represented in working memory both the first stimulus identity and the postponed informed choice and another that transiently coded the initial sensory information and the result of the comparison between the two stimuli. Additionally, we identified relevant signals that coded the timing of task events. These temporal and task-parameter readouts were shown to be strongly linked to the monkeys’ behavior when contrasted to those obtained in a non-demanding cognitive control task and during error trials. These signals, hidden in the heterogeneity, were prominently represented by the DPC population response."
https://openalex.org/W2775373776,"Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an evident growing disease that affects different cultures throughout the world. T2DM occurs under the influence of three main factors: the genetic background, environmental and behavioral components. Obesity is strongly associated to the development of T2DM in the occident, while in the orient most of the diabetic patients are considered lean. Genetics may be a key factor in the development of T2DM in societies where obesity is not a recurrent public health problem. Herein, two different models of rats were used to understand their differences and reliability as experimental models to study the pathophysiology of T2DM, in two different approaches: the genetic (GK rats) and the environmental (HFD-induced obese rats) influences. GK rats were resistant to weight gain even though food/energy consumption (relative to body weight) was higher in this group. HFD, on the other hand, induced obesity in Wistar rats. White adipose tissue (WAT) expansion in this group was accompanied by immune cells infiltration, inflammation and insulin resistance. GK rats also presented WAT inflammation and insulin resistance; however, no immune cells infiltration was observed in the WAT of this group. Liver of HFD group presented fat accumulation without differences in inflammatory cytokines content, while liver of GK rats didn't present fat accumulation, but showed an increase of IL-6 and IL-10 content and glycogen. Also, GK rats showed increased plasma GOT and GPT. Soleus muscle of HFD presented normal insulin signaling, contrary to GK rats, which presented higher content of basal phosphorylation of GSK-3β. Our results demonstrated that HFD developed a mild insulin resistance in Wistar rats, but was not sufficient to develop T2DM. In contrast, GK rats presented all the typical hallmarks of T2DM, such as insulin resistance, defective insulin production, fasting hyperglycemia/hyperinsulinemia and lipid plasma alteration. Thus, on the given time point of this study, we may conclude that only GK rats shown to be a reliable model to study T2DM."

https://openalex.org/W2772228530,"In order to better understand the complex geologic history of the Mediterranean area, we have analysed evolutionary history, phylogeographic structure and molecular diversity of freshwater fishes belonging to the genus Telestes. As primary freshwater fishes distributed largely in the Mediterranean basin, this genus represents a suitable model system for investigating the historical biogeography of freshwater drainage systems in southern Europe. In this investigation we have included samples representing all Telestes species and based our analyses on one mitochondrial and one nuclear gene. We have investigated phylogenetic structure inside the genus Telestes, estimated divergence times, reconstructed ancestral distribution ranges and described intraspecific molecular diversity. Diversification of Telestes started in the Early Miocene, when the ancestors of T. souffia, lineage comprising T. croaticus and T. fontinalis, and the one comprising T. pleurobipunctatus and T. beoticus got isolated. The remaining species are genetically more closely related and form a common cluster in the recovered phylogenetic trees. Complex geological history of southern Europe, including formation of continental bridges, fragmentation of landmass, closing of the sea corridor, local tectonic activities, led to complicated biogeographical pattern of this genus, caused by multiple colonization events and passovers between ancient rivers and water basins. Especially pronounced diversity of Telestes found in the Adriatic watershed in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina is a consequence of a triple colonization of this area by different lineages, which led to an existence of genetically distinct species in neighboring areas. Significant intraspecific structuring is present in T. souffia, T. muticellus, T. croaticus and T. pleurobipunctatus. Besides in well-structured species, elevated levels of genetic polymorphism were found inside T. turskyi and T. ukliva, as a consequence of their old origin and unconstrained evolutionary history."

Recombinant Env trimers such as the prototype BG505 SOSIP.664 that closely mimic the native Env spike can induce autologous neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against relatively resistant (tier 2) primary viruses. Ideally, Env immunogens should present broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes but limit the presentation of immunodominant non-NAb epitopes that might induce off-target and potentially interfering responses. The V3 loop in gp120 is such a non-NAb epitope that can effectively elicit non-NAbs when animals are immunized with SOSIP.664 trimers. V3 immunogenicity can be diminished, but not abolished, by reducing the conformational flexibility of trimers via targeted sequence changes, including an A316W substitution in V3, that create the SOSIP.v4.1 and SOSIP.v5.2 variants. Here, we further modified these trimer designs by introducing leucine residues at V3 positions 306 and 308 to create hydrophobic interactions with the tryptophan residue at position 316 and with other topologically proximal sites in the V1V2 domain. Together, these modifications further stabilized the resulting SOSIP.v5.2 S306L/R308L trimers in the prefusion state in which V3 is sequestered. When we tested these trimers as immunogens in rabbits, the induction of V3 non-NAbs was significantly reduced compared with the SOSIP.v5.2 trimers and even more so compared with the SOSIP.664 prototype, without affecting the autologous NAb response.

https://openalex.org/W2772925837,"The development of effective antifungal therapeutics remains a formidable challenge because of the close evolutionary relationship between humans and fungi. Mitochondrial function may present an exploitable vulnerability because of its differential utilization in fungi and its pivotal roles in fungal morphogenesis, virulence, and drug resistance already demonstrated by others. We now report mechanistic characterization of ML316, a thiohydantoin that kills drug-resistant Candida species at nanomolar concentrations through fungal-selective inhibition of the mitochondrial phosphate carrier Mir1. Using genetic, biochemical, and metabolomic approaches, we established ML316 as the first Mir1 inhibitor. Inhibition of Mir1 by ML316 in respiring yeast diminished mitochondrial oxygen consumption, resulting in an unusual metabolic catastrophe marked by citrate accumulation and death. In a mouse model of azole-resistant oropharyngeal candidiasis, ML316 reduced fungal burden and enhanced azole activity. Targeting Mir1 could provide a new, much-needed therapeutic strategy to address the rapidly rising burden of drug-resistant fungal infection."

New compounds that stimulate sGC show clinical promise, but where these stimulator compounds bind and how they function remains unknown. Here, using a photolyzable diazirine derivative of a novel stimulator compound, IWP-051, and MS analysis, we localized drug binding to the β1 heme domain of sGC proteins from the hawkmoth Manduca sexta and from human. Covalent attachments to the stimulator were also identified in bacterial homologs of the sGC heme domain, referred to as H-NOX domains, including those from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, Shewanella oneidensis, Shewanella woodyi, and Clostridium botulinum, indicating that the binding site is highly conserved. The identification of photoaffinity-labeled peptides was aided by a signature MS fragmentation pattern of general applicability for unequivocal identification of covalently attached compounds. Using NMR, we also examined stimulator binding to sGC from M. sexta and bacterial H-NOX homologs. These data indicated that stimulators bind to a conserved cleft between two subdomains in the sGC heme domain. L12W/T48W substitutions within the binding pocket resulted in a 9-fold decrease in drug response, suggesting that the bulkier tryptophan residues directly block stimulator binding. The localization of stimulator binding to the sGC heme domain reported here resolves the longstanding question of where stimulators bind and provides a path forward for drug discovery."

Incremental integration of global contours through interplay between visual cortical areas.Neuron. 2014; 82: 682-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) studies have shown that multiple cortical areas are involved in integrating discrete contour fragments into global contours. In particular, individual neurons in both the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher-tier cortical area, V4, can detect camouflaged contours (Figure 1A). However, the contour-related signals in V1 do not emerge until ∼50 ms after neuronal response outset, ∼40 ms later than in V4 (Chen et al., 2014Chen M. Yan Y. Gong X. Gilbert C.D. Liang H. Li W. Incremental integration of global contours through interplay between visual cortical areas.Neuron. 2014; 82: 682-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similar delayed signals in V1 are also present in segmenting visual surfaces (Poort et al., 2012Poort J. Raudies F. Wannig A. Lamme V.A. Neumann H. Roelfsema P.R.

These earlier findings suggest that image grouping and segmentation are mediated by concerted intra- and inter-areal interactions, but the underlying neural process remains largely unclear. Intra- and inter-areal anatomical connections are characterized by feedforward and feedback projections among distinct cortical laminae (for a recent comprehensive study, see Markov et al., 2014Markov N.T. Vezoli J. Chameau P. Falchier A. Quilodran R. Huissoud C. Lamy C. Misery P. Giroud P. Ullman S. et al.Anatomy of hierarchy: feedforward and feedback pathways in macaque visual cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2014; 522: 225-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Moreover, tracing studies have shown that the local intrinsic connections and the projections coming from adjoining areas constitute ∼95% of the afferents of a cortical area (Markov et al., 2011Markov N.T. Misery P. Falchier A. Lamy C. Vezoli J. Quilodran R. Gariel M.A. Giroud P. Ercsey-Ravasz M. Pilaz L.J. et al.Weight consistency specifies regularities of macaque cortical networks.Cereb. Cortex. 2011; 21: 1254-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Therefore, mapping neuronal activities simultaneously in different layers of adjacent visual cortical areas can help uncover the complex neural computations during visual image processing. It has been shown that monkeys’ performance in grouping tasks is severely impaired by lesions of the intermediate-level visual areas V2 (Merigan et al., 1993Merigan W.H. Nealey T.A. Maunsell J.H.R. Visual effects of lesions of cortical area V2 in macaques.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3180-3191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or V4 (Merigan, 1996Merigan W.H. Basic visual capacities and shape discrimination after lesions of extrastriate area V4 in macaques.Vis. Neurosci. 1996; 13: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but not the top-tier areas in the inferotemporal cortex (Huxlin et al., 2000Huxlin K.R. Saunders R.C. Marchionini D. Pham H.A. Merigan W.H. Perceptual deficits after lesions of inferotemporal cortex in macaques.Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role of V2 and V4 in perceptual grouping. Because V1 is also closely engaged in image grouping and segmentation, in the current study we investigate how neural signals emerge, propagate, and interact among different laminae in V1 and V2 to fulfill integration of visual contours. We trained two monkeys (named MO and ML) to do a contour detection task. The contour was formed by collinear bars embedded in a full screen of randomly oriented bars (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). In each trial, the contour was centered—randomly with equal probability—either on the receptive field (RF) of the examined recording site or at the symmetrical location relative to the fixation point (in the opposite visual field). The stimulus was presented for 500 ms. The monkeys maintained fixation until 300 ms after the stimulus disappeared and then made a saccade to indicate the location of the contour. The monkeys’ performance increased with the contour length, reaching a detection rate above 98% for contours longer than 9 bars (Figure 1B). We measured V1 and V2 retinotopic maps corresponding to the lower visual field and identified retinotopically matched locations in these two cortical areas (Figure 1C). We recorded multi-unit activities and local field potentials (LFPs) in V1 and V2 simultaneously using a pair of linear probes (U-Probe with 24 recording contacts spaced 100 μm, Plexon) perpendicular to the cortical surface. V2 recordings were made in the cortical tissue underlying the occipital operculum, immediately posterior to the lunate sulcus, by penetrating through the surface cortex (Figure S1A). The RF sizes (measured as minimum response fields using drifting gratings; STAR Methods) ranged from 0.5°–1.5° in V1 and 2.0°–4.5° in V2 (Figure 1C, right). To delineate the cortical layers, we measured the LFPs evoked by a full-screen checkerboard stimulus (STAR Methods). We applied the current source density (CSD) analysis to the LFPs of recording sites showing significant stimulus-evoked spiking activities. We identified the two adjacent sites on the linear probe between which the CSD polarity was reversed around 50 ms after stimulus onset (Figure 1D, population averaged CSD; Figures S1B and S1C, examples of individual penetrations); the site closer to the superficial cortical layer was defined as depth 0, which provides a reliable estimate of the boundary between cortical layers 4 and 5 (Bollimunta et al., 2008Bollimunta A.

Layer-specificity in the effects of attention and working memory on activity in primary visual cortex.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 13804Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we assigned visually responsive sites into three laminae: the supra-granular (SG), granular (G), and infra-granular (IG) layers (STAR Methods). While the animals were doing the contour detection task, we simultaneously recorded neuronal responses from V1 and V2. The RF locations and preferred orientations of the recording sites along the linear probe in each penetration were very similar (Figure S1D), consistent with the columnar structure of V1 and V2; therefore, we used their median values for placing the contours in a recording session. To make stimulus settings comparable across different V1 or V2 penetrations, we conducted two experimental sessions for each pair of V1 and V2 penetrations, with the contour location and orientation matching the V1 RFs in one session and matching the V2 RFs in the other session. To examine contour-related responses in V1 or V2, we randomly set the contour length to 1, 3, 5, 9, or 13 collinear bars in a trial and randomly placed the contour either on the recorded RFs (defined as the contour-on condition; Figure 1A) or in the opposite quadrant of the visual field (defined as the contour-away condition). Each stimulus condition was repeated in 50 trials. Under the contour-away conditions, a background bar was always set in the RF center at the optimal orientation to provide a consistent control condition against which neuronal responses to contours of different lengths in the contour-on conditions were compared. Note that we examined V1 and V2 responses separately in two different experimental sessions, but neuronal signals were collected simultaneously in both areas for subsequent analysis of inter-areal interactions. Pooling recording sites from different penetrations showed that population responses of neurons increased with the contour length in both V1 and V2 (Figures 2A and 2D ), correlated with the animals’ performance in the detection task. We measured the strength of the contour signal at a recording site by calculating the d′ value of its firing rates (within 0–500 ms) between the contour-on and contour-away conditions (STAR Methods). The contour signals were seen mainly in the SG and upper IG layers of V1 and in the SG and G layers of V2 (Figures 2B and 2E, population data; Figure S1E, example of a single penetration). Moreover, the overall signal strength was much stronger in V2 than in V1 for the same contour length (for the 13-bar contour, the mean d′ averaged across all recorded sites in both animals was 1.81 ± 0.22 in V2 and 0.61 ± 0.11 in V1 (mean ± SEM, two-sided t test, p = 1.1 × 10−5). We quantified the percentage of recording sites that showed significant contour signals (d′ > 0, p < 0.05) to the longest contour (13 bars) at each cortical depth. The laminar distribution pattern of these contour-encoding sites generally coincided with that of contour signals (compare Figures 2C and 2F with Figures 2B and 2E). It is worth noting that the bimodal distribution of contour-encoding sites in V1, with the two peaks located in the SG and IG layers, resembles the laminar distribution of feedback projections from V2 to V1 (Rockland and Virga, 1989Rockland K.S. Virga A. Terminal arbors of individual “feedback” axons projecting from area V2 to V1 in the macaque monkey: a study using immunohistochemistry of anterogradely transported Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin.J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 285: 54-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the strongest contour signals in both V1 and V2 were generated in the middle and lower part of the SG layer (Figures 2B and 2E), roughly corresponding to the main output layer (layer 3) projecting to the downstream areas (Markov et al., 2014Markov N.T. Vezoli J. Chameau P. Falchier A. Quilodran R. Huissoud C. Lamy C. Misery P. Giroud P. Ullman S. et al.Anatomy of hierarchy: feedforward and feedback pathways in macaque visual cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2014; 522: 225-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This suggests that the contour signals can be amplified, respectively, within each cortical area. Response latencies of individual neurons are notoriously difficult to quantify because of random fluctuations of neuronal responses, especially when the responses are weak and the number of trials is limited. To estimate the time required for contour signals to emerge at each cortical depth after stimulus onset, we employed a population measure (STAR Methods). By applying a 10-ms window sliding in 5-ms steps across the spike trains (−300 to 500 ms), we calculated the percentage of recording sites that showed significant contour responses (d′ > 0, p < 0.05) within the sliding window at each time point (Figure 3A). The mean percentage value averaged across the time points before stimulus onset (−300 to 0 ms) was used as a baseline control for the false positive error rate of contour-encoding sites. Percentage values that were 3 SD above this baseline were taken as statistically significant. We identified the first time point when 3 consecutive percentage values were all statistically significant. This time point was defined as the latency of contour signals (white dots in Figure 3A; referred to as the contour response latency). The latencies of stimulus-evoked responses at each cortical depth were calculated similarly (yellow circles in Figure 3A; referred to as the visual response latency; STAR Methods). On average, the visual response latencies in V1 were ∼10 ms longer in the SG layer (MO, 48.6 ± 5.6 ms; ML, 45.0 ± 7.6 ms; bootstrapping, mean ± SD) than the G and IG layers (MO, 39.5 ± 4.2 ms; ML, 35.5 ± 1.5 ms) (p < 0.005 for both monkeys), consistent with previous studies (Nowak et al., 1995Nowak L.G.

The variation of visual response latencies in V2 was small across different depths, with mean values of 47.7 ± 3.3 ms in MO and 40.8 ± 3.4 ms in ML. Unlike visual response latencies, within V1, the contour response latencies in the SG and upper IG layers were relatively shorter than in the G and lower IG layers (bootstrapping, p = 0.036 for MO and 0.039 for ML). Moreover, the contour response latencies across nearly all V1 depths were longer than 100 ms, ∼50 ms longer than the visual response latencies (Figure 3A, top row). In contrast, at most cortical depths within the V2 SG layer, the contour response latencies were 50–60 ms, only ∼15 ms longer than the visual response latencies (Figure 3A, bottom row); in V2 G and IG layers, the contour response latencies were all longer than 100 ms, comparable with V1. To further verify the earlier emergence of contour signals in V2 compared with V1, we plotted the distribution of d′ values based on early neuronal responses (40–100 ms; Figure 3B, left column). The distribution was symmetrical about 0 in V1 but remarkably skewed to the positive side in V2. Moreover, V1 sites showing d′ values significantly larger or smaller than 0 (bootstrapping, p < 0.05) had similarly low incidences (Figure 3B, blue bars, top left panel; positive 8%, negative 5%), suggesting that these significant sites could be largely due to random fluctuations of neuronal responses. However, many more V2 sites showed significant contour signals (d′ > 0, p < 0.05) during the early phase of neuronal responses (Figure 3B, blue bars, bottom left; positive 24%, negative 2%). These results confirmed the presence of a special group of V2 sites (defined as the early sites; Figure 3C, left), in contrast with the other sites, which encoded the contours only in their later response components (defined as the late sites; Figure 3C, right). In spite of such a distinction, we did not see noticeable differences between the early and late sites within the V2 SG layer with respect to basic response properties (two-sided t test for the mean RF sizes along the horizontal and vertical axes and for the mean orientation tuning width, respectively; p = 0.23, 0.47, and 0.77 in MO; p = 0.89, 0.59, 0.16 in ML). Because V2 RFs were on average several times larger than those in V1 (Figure 1C, right), the early contour signals in V2 might result from feedforward or within-RF integration. This speculation was confirmed by calculating the d′ between neuronal responses to contours of different lengths: 5-bar versus 1-bar as a measure of the within-RF integration and 13-bar versus 9-bar as the extra-RF integration. Indeed, the early contour signals in the V2 SG layer were seen only when the collinear bars were confined within the RFs (Figure 3D, left); adding more collinear bars outside of the RFs only enhanced the late response components (Figure 3D, right). Our data imply that, even though the visual signals reach V1 earlier than V2, the contour signals propagate in the reverse direction. Nevertheless, a dramatic and concurrent increase of contour-related responses was seen ∼100 ms after stimulus onset across V1 and V2 sites (Figures 3B, right column, and 3C and 2A and 2D). Previous V1 studies have shown that global visual contours within a cluttered background induce two complementary modulatory effects (Chen et al., 2014Chen M. Yan Y. Gong X. Gilbert C.D. Liang H.

We examined in monkey MO whether such a response pattern was also present in V2. We placed a 13-bar contour at different distances from the RF center in the contour-on condition (insets in Figure 4A), with one of the background bars always located in the RF center at the optimal orientation; in the corresponding contour-away condition, the 13-bar contour was placed symmetrically around the fixation point in the opposite visual field. Each stimulus condition was repeated in 30 trials. Based on the spike trains recorded under the paired contour-on and contour-away conditions, we used a sliding time window to measure the temporal profile of d′ of a recording site after stimulus onset. All recording sites in the SG layer, where the contour signals were the strongest, were averaged to get the population profiles of d′ (Figure 4A). With increasing the distance between the contour and RF center, the temporal profile of d′ dropped rapidly in both V1 and V2, indicating a reduction in contour facilitation. When the contour was moved farther away so that the RF was located on the background elements surrounding the contour (referred to as the contour-near condition to be differentiated from the contour-on and contour-away conditions), the facilitatory effect turned into inhibition (d′ values changed from positive to negative). During the stimulus presentation period, the contour facilitation was rather sustained in both V1 and V2, whereas the background inhibition was dynamically changing (Figure 4A). It was strongest ∼200 ms after stimulus onset and began to decline afterward; it even changed into weak facilitation for contours located near the RF, suggesting dynamic changes of the modulatory zones. To examine the spatial extents of contour-induced modulations and their temporal dynamics, we calculated the d′ values within two separate time windows. The mean d′ of recording sites in the SG layer as a function of the contour-to-RF distance was fitted with a difference of Gaussian function (Figure 4B). Within the first time window (100–200 ms), the mean radius of the facilitatory center in V2 (1.89°, measured from the intersection of the black fitted curve and the horizontal dashed line; Figure 4B, right) was twice of that in V1 (0.89°; Figure 4B, left); the inhibitory surround was ∼4 times as large as the facilitatory center in both V1 and V2. Within the second time window (400–500 ms), the facilitatory center was slightly enlarged, and the background inhibition was weakened (Figure 4B, gray versus black). Figure 4A shows remarkable temporal dynamics of background inhibition, which was measured by pairing the contour-near with contour-away conditions. To further dissect such dynamics, we used the 1-bar contour condition as a baseline control, in which no global contour was present within the full-screen background stimuli. We compared neuronal responses in this no-contour baseline condition with the contour-away condition and the contour-near condition when the RF-to-contour distance was 2.5° in V1 and 3.5° in V2 (Figure 4C). In the contour-away condition, neuronal responses in both V1 and V2 were inhibited (relative to the no-contour baseline condition) ∼200 ms after stimulus onset (Figure 4C, gray versus black), causing a downward shift of the post-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) toward that in the contour-near condition (Figure 4C, gray versus blue) and, thus, a progressive decrease of the background inhibition, as seen in Figure 4A. Given the identical stimuli on the RF side between the no-contour baseline condition and the contour-away condition (see the center and right insets in Figure 4C), the further delayed and cross-hemifield inhibitory effect (referred to as the contralateral suppression) was most likely associated with attentional capture by the salient contour in the opposite visual field. The three types of modulatory effects described above showed similar laminar distribution patterns: they mainly took place in V1 SG and upper IG layers and in V2 SG and G layers (Figures 5A–5C), and the same type of modulation began earlier in V2 than V1 (Figures 5D and 5E). In spite of these similarities, the three modulatory effects markedly differed in their latencies: the contour facilitation emerged earlier (100 ± 7 ms in V1, 66 ± 4 ms in V2; mean ± SD, bootstrapping), the background inhibition started later (126 ± 13 ms in V1, 115 ± 7 ms in V2), and the contralateral suppression was further delayed (249 ± 15 ms in V1, 211 ± 12 ms in V2). Figure 5A shows the time courses of contour facilitation at different cortical depths using population-averaged d′ as a measure. These results are consistent with those measured using the percentage of recording sites showing significant contour signals (Figure 3A). The presence of different modulatory effects dissociable in space and time suggests different processes for grouping contour fragments and segregating background components through complex intra- and inter-areal interactions. The earlier onset of these modulatory effects in V2 compared with V1 points to a countercurrent processing stream. To dissect the interactions between different layers in V1 and V2, we performed the Granger causality (GC) analysis in the frequency domain using spike trains (STAR Methods). Granger causality has been widely used as a statistical measure of the directional influence between two cortical loci (Bosman et al., 2012Bosman C.A. Schoffelen J.M. Brunet N. Oostenveld R.

In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 technique was used to edit MSTN in Shaanbei Cashmere goats and generate knockout animals. RNA sequencing was used to determine and compare the transcriptome profiles of the muscles from three wild-type (WT) goats, three fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) knockout goats (FGF5+/- group) and three goats with disrupted expression of both the FGF5 and MSTN genes (FM+/- group). The sequence reads were obtained using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system and mapped to the Capra hircus reference genome using TopHat (v2.0.9). In total, 68.93, 62.04 and 66.26 million clean sequencing reads were obtained from the WT, FM+/- and FGF5+/- groups, respectively. There were 201 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the WT and FGF5+/- groups, with 86 down- and 115 up-regulated genes in the FGF5+/- group. Between the WT and FM+/- groups, 121 DEGs were identified, including 81 down- and 40 up-regulated genes in the FM+/- group. A total of 198 DEGs were detected between the FGF5+/- group and FM+/- group, with 128 down- and 70 up-regulated genes in the FM+/- group. At the transcriptome level, we found substantial changes in genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, such as stearoyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 2, ELOVL fatty acid elongase 6 and fatty acid synthase, suggesting that the expression levels of these genes may be directly regulated by MSTN and that these genes are likely downstream targets of MSTN with potential roles in lipid metabolism in goats. Moreover, five randomly selected DEGs were further validated with qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with the transcriptome analysis. The present study provides insight into the unique transcriptome profile of the MSTN knockout goat, which is a valuable resource for studying goat genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2773571136,"The premotor cortex (PM) receives inputs from parietal cortical areas representing processed visuospatial information, translates that information into programs for particular movements, and communicates those programs to the primary motor cortex (M1) for execution. Consistent with this general function, intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in the PM of sufficient frequency, amplitude, and duration has been shown to evoke complex movements of the arm and hand that vary systematically depending on the locus of stimulation. Using frequencies and amplitudes too low to evoke muscle activity, however, we found that ICMS in the PM can provide instructions to perform specific reach, grasp, and manipulate movements. These instructed actions were not fixed but rather were learned through associations between the arbitrary stimulation locations and particular movements. Low-amplitude ICMS at different PM locations thus evokes distinguishable experiences that can become associated with specific movements arbitrarily, providing a novel means of injecting information into the nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2774841515,"ATP is mainly generated by glycolysis in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and is consumed to maintain cell viability. Differences in mitochondrial activity among induced (i)PSCs with different degrees of pluripotency are poorly understood. In this study, by comparing gene expression and mitochondrial activity among iPSCs with different degrees of pluripotency, we found that mitochondrial complex I gene expression, complex I activity, and cellular ATP levels were much higher in fully pluripotent stem cell lines than in partially pluripotent stem cell lines. Actin-like protein 6a (Actl6a), a component of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation complexes, was more highly expressed in fully pluripotent stem cell lines. ATP promoted Actl6a expression and histone acetylation. Actl6a knockdown reduced the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and this reduction could not be rescued by the addition of ATP. Furthermore, inhibiting ATP formation by treatment with rotenone reduced the pluripotency of ESCs. These data suggest that the abundance of mitochondrially produced ATP affects stem cell pluripotency via Actl6a-mediated histone acetylation.— Zhang, Y., Cui, P., Li, Y., Feng, G., Tong, M., Guo, L., Li, T., Liu, L., Li, W., Zhou, Q.

Therefore, a low salt diet is now recommended to prevent hypertension and cardiovascular disease. However, it is still unknown whether an excessively low salt diet is beneficial or harmful for the heart.Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) received normal salt chow (0.9% salt diet) and excessively low salt chow (0.01% salt diet referred to as saltless diet) for 8 weeks from 8 to 16 weeks of age. The effects of the excessively low salt diet on the cardiac (pro) renin receptor, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, and sympatho-adrenal systems were investigated.The excessively low salt diet did not affect the systolic blood pressure but significantly increased the heart rate both in WKYs and SHRs. The excessively low salt diet significantly elevated plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin I, II and aldosterone concentrations, and plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations both in WKYs and SHRs. Cardiac expressions of renin, prorenin, (P)RR, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin II AT1 receptor and phosphorylated (p)-ERK1/2, p-HSP27, p-38MAPK, and TGF-ß1 were significantly enhanced by the excessively low salt diet in both WKYs and SHRs. The excessively low salt diet accelerated cardiac interstitial and perivascular fibrosis and increased the cardiomyocyte size and interventricular septum thickness in WKYs and SHRs but the extent was greater in SHRs.An excessively low salt diet damages the heart through activation of plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympatho-adrenal systems and activation of cardiac (P)RR and angiotensin II AT1 receptor and their downstream signals both in WKYs and SHRs."
https://openalex.org/W2773380467,"NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are a subtype of postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors that function as molecular coincidence detectors, have critical roles in models of learning, and are associated with a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. To date, no auxiliary proteins that modify NMDARs have been identified. Here, we report the identification of NRAP-1, an auxiliary protein in C. elegans that modulates NMDAR function. NMDAR-mediated currents were eliminated in nrap-1 mutants, as was NMDA-dependent behavior. We show that reconstitution of NMDA-gated current in Xenopus oocytes, or C. elegans muscle cells, depends on NRAP-1 and that recombinant NRAP-1 can convert silent NMDARs to functional channels. Our data indicate that NRAP-1, secreted from presynaptic neurons, localizes to glutamatergic synapses, where it associates with postsynaptic NMDARs to modify receptor gating. Thus, our studies reveal a novel mechanism for synaptic regulation via pre-synaptic control of NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission."

We found that fructose acutely and transiently suppressed mTORC1 signaling in vitro and in vivo. The constitutive activation of mTORC1 reduced hepatic lipogenic gene expression and produced hypotriglyceridemia after 1 week of fructose feeding. In contrast, glucose did not suppress mTORC1, and the constitutive activation of mTORC1 failed to suppress plasma triglycerides after 1 week of glucose feeding.

https://openalex.org/W2774959352,"Reliable detection of return of spontaneous circulation with minimal interruptions of chest compressions is part of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and routinely done by checking pulsation of carotid arteries. However, manual palpation was time-consuming and unreliable even if performed by expert clinicians. Therefore, automated accurate pulse detection with minimal interruptions of chest compression is highly desirable during cardiac arrest especially in out-of-hospital settings.To investigate whether the acceleration (ACC) signals acquired from accelerometer-based CPR feedback sensor can be used to distinguish perfusing rhythm (PR) from pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in a porcine model of cardiac arrest.Cardiac arrest was induced in 49 male adult pigs. ECG, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and ACC waveforms were simultaneously recorded during CPR. 3-second segments containing compression-free signals during chest compression pauses were extracted and only those segments with organized rhythm were used for analysis. PR was defined as systolic arterial pressure >60 mmHg and pulse pressure >10 mmHg, while PEA was defined as an organized rhythm that does not meet the above criteria for PR. Peak correlation coefficient (CCp) of the cross-correlation function between pre-processed ECG and ACC, was used to discriminate PR and PEA.63 PR and 153 PEA were identified from the total of 1025 extracted segments. CCp was significantly higher for PR as compared to PEA (0.440±0.176 vs. 0.067±0.042, p<0.01) and highly correlated with ABP (r = 0.848, p<0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 0.965, 93.6%, 97.5% and 96.7% for the ACC-based automatic spontaneous pulse detection.In this animal model, the ACC signals acquired from an accelerometer-based CPR feedback sensor can be used to detect the presence of spontaneous pulse with high accuracy."

https://openalex.org/W2774167832,"The improvement in sickle cell anemia (SCA) care resulted in the emergence of a large population of adults living with this disease. The mechanisms of lung injury in this new population are largely unknown. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) represents the current state-of-the-art in the assessment of lung function. The present work uses the FOT to improve our knowledge about the respiratory abnormalities in SCA, evaluates the associations of FOT with the functional exercise capacity and investigates the early detection of respiratory abnormalities.Spirometric classification of restrictive abnormalities resulted in three categories: controls (n = 23), patients with a normal exam (n = 21) and presenting pulmonary restriction (n = 24). FOT analysis showed that, besides restrictive changes (reduced compliance; p<0.001), there is also an increase in respiratory resistance (p<0.001) and ventilation heterogeneity (p<0.01). FOT parameters are associated with functional exercise capacity (R = -0.38), pulmonary diffusion (R = 0.66), respiratory muscle performance (R = 0.41), pulmonary volumes (R = 0.56) and airway obstruction (R = 0.54). The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by investigating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A combination of FOT and machine learning (ML) classifiers showed adequate diagnostic accuracy in the detection of early respiratory abnormalities (AUC = 0.82).In this study, the use of FOT showed that adults with SCA develop a mixed pattern of respiratory disease. Changes in FOT parameters are associated with functional exercise capacity decline, abnormal pulmonary mechanics and diffusion. FOT associated with ML methods accurately diagnosed early respiratory abnormalities. This suggested the potential utility of the FOT and ML clinical decision support systems in the identification of respiratory abnormalities in patients with SCA."
https://openalex.org/W2772934331,"Vascular plants serve as target species for the evaluation of restoration success as they account for most of the plant species diversity and vegetation cover. Although bryophytes contribute considerably to the species diversity of meadows, they are rarely addressed in restoration projects. This project is a first step toward making recommendations for including mosses in alluvial floodplain restoration projects. The opportunity to assess the diversity and ecological requirements of mosses on floodplain meadows presented itself within the framework of a vegetation monitoring that took place in 2014 on meadows located along the northern Upper Rhine. In this area, large-scale meadow restoration projects have taken place since 1997 in both the functional and fossil floodplains. Other studies have shown that bryophytes are generally present in green hay used in restoration, providing inadvertent bryophyte introduction. We compared bryophyte communities in donor and restored communities and correlated these communities with environmental variables-taking into account that the mosses on the restoration sites possibly developed from green hay. This analysis provided insights as to which species of bryophytes should be included in future restoration projects, what diaspores should be used, and how they should be transferred. Data on bryophyte occurrence were gathered from old meadows, and from restoration sites. We found distinct differences in bryophyte composition (based on frequency) in restored communities in functional flood plains compared to donor communities. Generally, restoration sites are still characterized by a lower species-richness, with a significantly lower occurrence of rare and red listed species and a lower species-heterogeneity. In conclusion, our research establishes what mosses predominate in donor and restored alluvial meadows along the northern Upper River, and what microsite conditions favour particular species. This points the way to deliberate introduction of moss diaspores for more complete alluvial meadow restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2772315545,"Interferon α (IFNα) is important for antiviral and anticancer defenses. However, overproduction is associated with autoimmune disorders. Thus, the cell must precisely up- and down-regulate IFNα to achieve immune system homeostasis. The cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) is reported to inhibit IFNα production. However, the mechanism for this antagonism remained unknown. The goal here was to identify this mechanism. Here we examined the signal transduction events that occur during TLR9-induced IRF7 activation. The cFLIP long isoform (cFLIPL) inhibited the expression of IRF7-controlled natural or synthetic genes in several cell lines, including those with abundant IRF7 protein levels (e.g. dendritic cells). cFLIPL inhibited IRF7 phosphorylation; however, cFLIPL-IRF7 interactions were not detectable, implying that cFLIPL acted upstream of IRF7 dimerization. Interestingly, cFLIPL co-immunoprecipitated with IKKα, and these interactions correlated with a loss of IKKα-IRF7 interactions. Thus, cFLIP appears to bind to IKKα to prevent IKKα from phosphorylating and activating IRF7. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a cellular protein that uses this approach to inhibit IRF7 activation. Perhaps this cFLIP property could be engineered to minimize the deleterious effects of IFNα expression that occur during certain autoimmune disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2773864290,"Cytochrome P450 4x1 (Cyp4x1) is expressed at very high levels in the brain but the function of this protein is unknown. It has been hypothesised to regulate metabolism of fatty acids and to affect the activity of endocannabinoid signalling systems, which are known to influence appetite and energy metabolism. The objective of the present investigation was to determine the impact of Cyp4x1 on body weight and energy metabolism by developing a line of transgenic Cyp4x1-knock out mice. Mice were developed with a global knock-out of the gene; the full-length RNA was undetectable, and mice were viable and fertile. Both male and female Cyp4x1-knock out mice gained significantly more body weight on normal lab chow diet compared to control flox mice on the same genetic background. At necropsy, Cyp4x1-knock out male mice had significantly greater intra-abdominal fat deposits (P<0.01), and enlarged adipocytes. Metabolic rate and locomotor activity as inferred from VO2 measures and crossing of infrared beams in metabolic cages were not significantly affected by the mutation in either gender. The respiratory exchange ratio was significantly decreased in male knock out mice (P<0.05), suggesting a greater degree of fat oxidation, consistent with their higher adiposity. When mice were maintained on a high fat diet, VO2 was significantly decreased in both male and female Cyp4x1-knock out mice. We conclude that the Cyp4x1-knock out mouse strain demonstrates a mildly obese phenotype, consistent with the view that cytochrome P450 4x1 plays a role in regulating fat metabolism."

While the national HAV vaccination program is largely associated with the shift of socioeconomic trend in the country, concerns have been raised on the effectiveness of the HAV immunization. The objective of this study was to examine the epidemiological trend of HAV and assess the effectiveness of the nationwide HAV vaccination policy based on a nationally representative sample of the Korean population collected in 2015.We analyzed anti-HAV of 5,856 respondents aged ≥10 years collected from Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data in 2015. We estimated age-adjusted anti-HAV prevalence by sociodemographic and other characteristics. We evaluated the factors associated with anti-HAV positivity among each age group (10-19, 20-29, 30-45 and over 45 years old).The prevalence of anti-HAV among adults aged ≥10 years was 72.5% (95% confidence interval, CI, 73.7-71.4) in 2015. The lowest age-specific prevalence was among adults aged 20-29 years with 11.9% (95% CI 9.3-15.1%). The prevalence of anti-HAV among those aged 10-14 and 15-19 years was 59.7% (95% CI 52.7-66.4) and 24.0% (95% CI 19.5-29.3), respectively. The prevalence of anti-HAV among adults aged between 30 and 44 years rapidly increased from below 20% to above 90%. The prevalence of anti-HAV among adults aged ≥45 years was 97.8% (95% CI 96.0-97.6). Factors significantly associated with anti-HAV positivity among those aged 10-19 years old were young age, higher house income and high influenza vaccination rate. Compared to the respondents aged 10-19 years (those who were subject to the national childhood vaccine recommendation), those aged 20-29 years (those who were not subject to the recommendation) had low adjusted odds ratio (OR, 0.52 95% CI 0.34-.81 P-value = 0.004) for anti-HAV positivity.The age-adjusted anti-HAV prevalence showed a U-shaped association, implying the high dependence of anti-HAV prevalence on age and the epidemiological shift. The inclusion of the hepatitis A vaccine into the national immunization recommendation was effective shown by the increase of immunity in the general population. However, the vaccination rate was low in the low-income group. Young adults aged 20-39 years may benefit from inclusion in the HAV vaccination program due to the significantly low vaccination rate."
