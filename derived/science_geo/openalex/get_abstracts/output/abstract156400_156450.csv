https://openalex.org/W2149353640,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections. A major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. Here we report the complete sequence of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. At 6.3 million base pairs, this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced, and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of P. aeruginosa. Consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability, P. aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism, transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems. We propose that the size and complexity of the P. aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances."

https://openalex.org/W2117641602,"Considerable effort is being devoted to the fabrication of nanoscale devices. Molecular machines, motors and switches have been made, generally operating in solution, but for most device applications (such as electronics and opto-electronics), a maximal degree of order and regularity is required. Crystalline materials would be excellent systems for these purposes, as crystals comprise a vast number of self-assembled molecules, with a perfectly ordered three-dimensional structure. In non-porous crystals, however, the molecules are densely packed and any change in them (due, for example, to a reaction) is likely to destroy the crystal and its properties. Here we report the controlled and fully reversible crystalline-state reaction of gaseous SO2 with non-porous crystalline materials consisting of organoplatinum molecules. This process, including repetitive expansion-reduction sequences (on gas uptake and release) of the crystal lattice, modifies the structures of these molecules without affecting their crystallinity. The process is based on the incorporation of SO2 into the colourless crystals and its subsequent liberation from the orange adducts by reversible bond formation and cleavage. We therefore expect that these crystalline materials will find applications for gas storage devices and as opto-electronic switches."

https://openalex.org/W1648525405,"One of the greatest challenges in robotics is to create machines that are able to interact with unpredictable environments in real time. A possible solution may be to use swarms of robots behaving in a self-organized manner, similar to workers in an ant colony. Efficient mechanisms of division of labour, in particular series-parallel operation and transfer of information among group members, are key components of the tremendous ecological success of ants. Here we show that the general principles regulating division of labour in ant colonies indeed allow the design of flexible, robust and effective robotic systems. Groups of robots using ant-inspired algorithms of decentralized control techniques foraged more efficiently and maintained higher levels of group energy than single robots. But the benefits of group living decreased in larger groups, most probably because of interference during foraging. Intriguingly, a similar relationship between group size and efficiency has been documented in social insects. Moreover, when food items were clustered, groups where robots could recruit other robots in an ant-like manner were more efficient than groups without information transfer, suggesting that group dynamics of swarms of robots may follow rules similar to those governing social insects."

Hbp together with Hrs is thought to play a regulatory role in endocytic trafficking of growth factor-receptor complexes through early endosomes. Association of Hbp with a binding partner(s) via the SH3 domain seems to be essential for Hbp to exert its function. In this study, we searched for Hbp-binding proteins by a far Western screening and isolated a mouse cDNA clone encoding a deubiquitinating enzyme mUBPY as an Hbp SH3-binding protein. mUBPY has two Hbp-SH3 domain binding sites.

It is a novel SH3-binding motif and does not contain the canonical proline-rich consensus binding motif, PXXP.

After growth factor binding, growth factor-receptor complexes are internalized and delivered to early endosomes. Thereafter, they escape recycling to the cell surface and are sorted to the degradation pathway, which leads to the down-regulation of growth factor receptors (1Sorkin A. Waters C.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism by which growth factor-receptor complexes are sorted for lysosomal degradation. Some of the early endosomal proteins may play a regulatory role in this sorting. Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) is an early endosomal protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells stimulated with growth factors (2Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 3Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Since Hrs is likely to be a mammalian homologue of the yeast Vps27p, which is essential for vacuolar and endocytic trafficking through a prevacuolar compartment (4Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), Hrs may be a regulator of endocytic trafficking through early endosomes in mammalian cells. Hrs tightly associates with Hrs-binding protein (Hbp)1 (5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hbp has an N-terminal VHS domain, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a coiled-coil motif, and a ITAM motif and associates with Hrs through the coiled-coil motif. Overexpression of deletion mutants of Hbp lacking either the SH3 domain or the coiled-coil motif inhibits the intracellular degradation of a growth factor and its receptor (5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, Hbp together with Hrs appears to play a regulatory role in the intracellular degradation of growth factor-receptor complexes through early endosomes, and the association of Hbp with a binding partner(s) via the SH3 domain may be essential for Hbp to exert its function. Hrs also associates with STAM (6Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which is homologous to Hbp and has the same domain structures as Hbp (7Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka H. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An SH3 domain deletion mutant of STAM shows dominant negative effects on DNA synthesis stimulated by interleukin-2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (8Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), suggesting that the SH3 domain of STAM is essential for its function. AMSH has been identified as a binding partner of the SH3 domain of STAM and has been shown to be involved in signaling for DNA synthesis stimulated by interleukin-2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (9Tanaka N. Kaneko K. Asao H. Kasai H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takeshita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19129-19135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). SH3 domains are present in many proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signaling and the organization of cytoskeletal matrices and mediate protein-protein interactions that regulate signal transduction (10Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 8-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar,11Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). SH3 domains recognize proline-rich peptides containing the core PXXP. Structural and mutagenic analysis of peptide-SH3 complexes revealed that proline-rich peptides associated with SH3 domains adopt a polyproline type II helix conformation with 3 residues per turn (12Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that peptide sequences other than proline-rich peptides are involved in binding to SH3 domains. The SH3 domain of p53BP2 interacts with a peptide sequence in p53 that is not proline-rich, and the interaction is essential for p53 to associate with p53BP2 (13Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Moreover, a PXXDY consensus sequence is indispensable for binding to the SH3 domain of Eps8, and the domain does not bind to canonical PXXP-containing peptides (14Mongiovi A.M. Romano P.R. Panni S. Mendoza M. Wong W.T. Musacchio A. Cesareni G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, interaction of SH3 domains with peptide sequences without the PXXP core plays a crucial role in the functional association of some SH3 domain-containing proteins with their binding partners. Since the SH3 domain of Hbp seems to be essential for the degradation of growth factor-receptor complexes, identification of its binding partners is necessary to elucidate how Hbp is involved in the degradation pathway. Therefore, we searched for Hbp-binding proteins by a far Western screening of a mouse cDNA library and isolated a cDNA clone encoding mouse UBPY (mUBPY) as an Hbp SH3-binding protein. We found by mutational analysis that a novel peptide sequence PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP is essential for the association of mUBPY with the SH3 domain of Hbp, and PXXP-containing sequences are not involved in this association. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this novel SH3-binding sequence mediates other protein-protein interactions. A λZAP mouse liver cDNA library was screened by a far Western method with the32P-labeled Hbp as a probe. To prepare probe, mouse Hbp cDNA was inserted into the NotI site of the pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein bound to the beads was incubated with human thrombin (Sigma) at room temperature for 4 h. After incubation, the Hbp protein cleaved from the GST tag was incubated with protein kinase (Sigma), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 30 °C. Free ATP was removed by a gel filtration on a Shephadex G-50 column, and the fraction containing the Hbp protein was used as a probe. Nitrocellulose membranes pretreated with 10 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside were overlaid onto phage plaques and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After being treated with blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5% skim milk, and 0.05% Tween 20) at room temperature for 2 h, the membranes were incubated with the probe (5 × 106 cpm/ml) in blocking buffer for 12 h at 4 °C. After a wash in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20, bound proteins were detected by autoradiography. The missing 5′-portion of the cDNA was obtained by 5′-RACE-PCR using Cap Site cDNATM Mouse Testis (Nippon Gene) as a template. The 1RC2 RACE1 primer and 5′-GTCTCAGCTTTCCATCTTGATC-3′ were used for the first PCR, and the 2RC2 RACE2 primer and 5′-CATCTTGATCAGTTACCAACA-3′ were used for nested PCR. To construct an expression vector with the HA-tagged sequence, two oligonucleotides, 5′-TCGAGCCGCCACCATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCACATTACGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACATGGTGGC-3′, were annealed and inserted into XhoI and NotI sites of an expression vector, pME18S (pME-HA). To construct an expression vector with the FLAG-tagged sequence, two oligonucleotides, 5′-TCGAGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGATGACAA-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCCTTGTCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCCATGGTGGC-3′, were annealed and inserted into the XhoI and NotI sites of an expression vector, pME18S (pME-FLAG). The cDNA fragment for the SH3 domain of Hbp was obtained by PCR using oligonucleotide primers withNotI linkers and mouse Hbp cDNA as a template and digested with NotI. cDNAs for full-length Hbp and its SH3 domain deletion mutant were excised from expression vectors pmiw-Hbp and pmiw-HbpΔSH3 (5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), respectively, by digestion withNotI. These cDNAs were inserted into the NotI site of pGEX-2TK vector. GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli. The cDNA encoding N-terminally HA-tagged Hbp was constructed by PCR using oligonucleotide primers with NotI linkers and mouse Hbp cDNA as a template. The PCR product was digested with NotI and inserted into the NotI site of the expression vector pME-HA. The cDNAs encoding N-terminally FLAG-tagged mUBPY and various portions of mUBPY were constructed by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotide primers withNotI linkers and mUBPY cDNA as a template. The PCR products were digested with NotI and inserted into theNotI site of the expression vector pME-FLAG. Expression vectors encoding deletion and point mutants of FLAG-tagged mUBPY were constructed with the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). AMSH cDNA was obtained by PCR using oligonucleotide primers with NotI linkers and human brain Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA (CLONTECH) as a template. The PCR product was digested with NotI and inserted into the NotI site of the expression vector pME-FLAG. Expression vectors encoding deletion mutants of FLAG-tagged AMSH were constructed with the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. The cDNA fragments for SH3 domains of various proteins were obtained by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotide primers with NotI linkers and mouse brain Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA as a template. The PCR products were digested with NotI and inserted into theNotI site of pGEX-2TK vector. GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli. The cDNA of mUBPY (amino acid residues 34–1080) was inserted into the SmaI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Rabbits were immunized with the purified protein, and anti-serum (anti-mUBPY) was raised. NIH3T3 cells and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into COS-7 cells by FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysate was prepared as described previously (5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cell lysate was incubated with purified GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 12 h at 4 °C. After the beads had been washed three times with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, the binding proteins were released by boiling in sample buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 1% SDS, 1% mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol), separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 5 μl of anti-mUBPY antiserum or 2 μg of anti-FLAG epitope monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used. For immunoblotting, 200 times diluted anti-mUBPY antiserum, 1 μg/ml of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, or 1 μg/ml of anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. To isolate cDNA clones encoding Hbp-interacting molecules, we screened a mouse liver cDNA library by a far Western method with the 32P-labeled full-length Hbp as a probe. We isolated several cDNA clones and identified them by computer-assisted sequence homology search. One of the cDNA clones encoded a protein that shared 80.6% amino acid sequence identity with human UBPY (15Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, the protein is a mouse counterpart of UBPY (mUBPY). UBPY is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (UBP) family. UBP family members contain two conserved motifs, a Cys box and a His box, in the catalytic domains (16Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 17Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These motifs are located in the C-terminal region of mUBPY (Fig.1). In addition, domain or motif prediction analysis of mUBPY using the SMART program (18Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After the beads had been washed, the binding proteins were released by boiling in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) using anti-UBPY antibody.

Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because the coiled-coil motif is involved in the interaction of Hbp with Hrs (5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the interaction of Hbp with UBPY may be mediated via the SH3 domain. To examine this possibility, mUBPY in lysates of NIH3T3 cells was assayed for in vitro binding to the immobilized GST-fused SH3 domain of Hbp. mUBPY bound to the GST-fused SH3 domain of Hbp (GST-Hbp-SH3) as well as the GST-fused full-length Hbp (GST-Hbp), whereas it did not bind to the GST-fused full-length Hbp lacking the SH3 domain (GST-HbpΔSH3) (Fig.2). These results indicate that Hbp interacts with mUBPY via the SH3 domain. mUBPY contains six proline-rich sequences that match the minimal SH3-binding motif consensus PXXP (Fig. 1 A). Among them, the647PSSAPPSTPP sequence matches the consensus SH3-binding site of the dynamin family, PXXXPPXXP (20Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). To determine which proline-rich sequence in mUBPY was involved in binding to the SH3 domain of Hbp, FLAG-tagged deletion mutants lacking each PXXP sequence in mUBPY were expressed in COS-7 cells and assayed for in vitro binding to the GST-fused SH3 domain of Hbp. Unexpectedly, all mutants bound to the SH3 domain of Hbp (data not shown), suggesting that mUBPY interacts with the SH3 domain of Hbp through a sequence other than the PXXP motif. Thus, to identify the sequence, a series of FLAG-tagged deletion mutants of mUBPY were expressed in COS-7 cells and assayed for in vitrobinding to the GST-fused SH3 domain of Hbp. The deletion mutant lacking 646 C-terminal amino acid residues () bound to the SH3 domain, whereas the mutant with a further 57-amino acid deletion (residues 1–377) did not (Fig. 3). These results indicate that a SH3-binding sequence in mUBPY is located within amino acids 378–434. Surprisingly, the deletion mutant lacking 506 N-terminal amino acid residues (507–1080) still bound to the SH3 domain, suggesting the presence of another SH3-binding sequence in the C-terminal region of mUBPY. The deletion mutant lacking 665 N-terminal amino acid residues (666–1080) bound to the SH3 domain, whereas the mutant with a further 66-amino acid deletion (732–1080) did not (Fig. 3). These results indicate that another SH3-binding sequence is located within amino acids 666–731. Because the SH3-binding sequences are located within amino acids 378–434 and 666–731, the two sequences were compared with search for a consensus sequence. In addition, the sequences of the corresponding regions in human UBPY were aligned with the mouse sequences. We found that all of these sequences contained 9-amino acid sequences fitting PXXXRXXKP (Fig.4 A). Moreover, the sequence was located in the region of AMSH that mediates association of the protein with the SH3 domain of STAM (9Tanaka N. Kaneko K. Asao H. Kasai H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takeshita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19129-19135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the sequences mediated the binding of UBPY to the SH3 domain of Hbp, FLAG-tagged deletion mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells and assayed for in vitro binding to the GST-fused SH3 domain of Hbp. The N-terminal half (residues 1–506) and C-terminal half (residues 507–1080) of mUBPY lacking the 9 amino acid residues (NΔ(405–413) and CΔ(700–708), respectively) did not bind to the SH3 domain of Hbp (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that PXXXRXXKP is a core sequence of the SH3 domain-binding motif (SBM) of mUBPY. To examine whether the sequences mediate the association of mUBPY with Hbp in vivo, FLAG-tagged full-length mUBPY or its deletion mutants were cotransfected with HA-tagged Hbp into COS-7 cells. Lysates of the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody. The deletion mutants lacking each SBM of mUBPY were coprecipitated with Hbp, whereas the mutant lacking both SBMs was not (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that mUBPY associates with Hbp in vivothrough either of the two SBMs in mUBPY. To investigate the contribution of individual amino acids in the PXXXRXXKP motif to the binding of mUBPY to the SH3 domain of Hbp, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the SBM (405PQVDRTKKP413) in the N-terminal region of mUBPY. FLAG-tagged mutant proteins in which each residue was replaced with an alanine were expressed in COS-7 cells and assayed for in vitro binding to the GST-fused SH3 domain of Hbp. Mutagenesis of the proline at position 405 or 413, the arginine at position 409, or the lysine at position 412 completely abolished binding. Mutagenesis of the valine at position 407 or the asparaginic acid at position 408 markedly reduced binding (Fig. 5). These results indicate that these amino acid residues are critical for the binding of mUBPY to the SH3 domain of Hbp. The valine at position 407 is substituted by an isoleucine in human UBPY, and the asparaginic acid at position 408 is substituted by an asparagine in the consensus motif of the C-terminal region of mUBPY and human UBPY (Fig. 4 A). Thus, the consensus sequence of the novel SBM is most likely PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP. AMSH was reported to bind to the SH3 domain of STAM via the PXXP motif (227PAKPP231) as a major binding site (9Tanaka N. Kaneko K. Asao H. Kasai H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takeshita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19129-19135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In that report, the motif was identified from the result that the deletion mutant of AMSH lacking the sequence of227PAKPP231 did not associate with the SH3 domain of STAM. The proline residue at position 231 corresponds to the first amino acid of the consensus sequence of the novel SBM, PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP (Fig.6 A) and is critical for the consensus sequence to mediate binding to the SH3 domain of Hbp. Thus, it is possible that AMSH associates with STAM via the novel SBM but not the PXXP motif. To examine this possibility, FLAG-tagged deletion mutants of AMSH were expressed in COS-7 cells and assayed forin vitro binding to the GST-fused SH3 domain of STAM. The deletion mutant lacking 227PAKP230 bound to the SH3 domain. However, the deletion mutants lacking the whole SBM or the C-terminal 5 residues failed to bind to the SH3 domain of STAM (Fig.6 B). These results suggest that a major site of AMSH for binding to the SH3 domain of STAM is the SBM but not the PXXP motif. Because the SH3 domain of Hbp is highly homologous to that of STAM (5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is expected to bind to AMSH via the novel SBM. Thus, FLAG-tagged deletion mutants of AMSH expressed in COS-7 cells were assayed forin vitro binding to the GST-fused SH3 domain of Hbp. The deletion mutants lacking the whole SBM or the C-terminal 5 residues did not bind to the SH3 domain of Hbp, whereas the deletion mutant lacking227PAKP230 did (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that AMSH interacts with the SH3 domain of Hbp via the SBM. There are a number of proteins that interact with SH3 domains of partner proteins. The novel SBM may mediate some of these interactions. Thus, we searched a data base for proteins containing the novel SBM by PatternSearch. The consensus sequence of the SBM, PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP, was found in members of the family of Grb2-associated binder (GAB) and the family of B cell linker protein (BLNK) (Fig. 7). It is possible that the sequence mediates the association of these proteins with their binding partners. SH3 domain-containing proteins bind to their binding partners through specific binding motifs. To determine the specificity of mUBPY for binding to SH3 domains, FLAG-tagged mUBPY expressed in COS-7 cells was assayed for in vitro binding to various GST-fused SH3 domains of signaling proteins. mUBPY bound to the SH3 domain of STAM as well as that of Hbp (Fig. 8 A). Interestingly, mUBPY also bound to the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. But it did not bind to the other SH3 domains including the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (Fig. 8 A). The deletion mutant of mUBPY lacking the SBMs failed to bind to the SH3 domains of Hbp and STAM and the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (data not shown), indicating that the SBMs mediate the interaction of mUBPY with these SH3 domains. Because the SH3 domain of Hbp is highly homologous to that of STAM (5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it may be homologous to the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. Thus, we compared the sequence of the SH3 domain of Hbp with those of other proteins (Fig. 8 B). The SH3 domain of Hbp aligned with that of the C-terminal region of Grb2 without any gaps. In addition, there are some amino acid residues that are common in the SH3 domains of Hbp and STAM and the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 but are distinct from those in other SH3 domains. In this study, we have identified mUBPY as a Hbp-SH3 domain-binding protein. UBPY is a deubiquitinating enzyme (15Naviglio S. Matteucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T. Nomura N. Di Fiore P.P. Draetta G.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Deubiquitinating enzymes are subdivided into two groups: ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases and ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UBPs) (21Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). UBPY is a member of the UBP group. UBPs are able to cleave both linear and isopeptide-linked ubiquitin chains. Some UBPs negatively regulate protein degradation by removing ubiquitin from substrates before they are destroyed by proteasomes (22Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), while other UBPs seem to positively regulate proteolysis. Yeast Ubp14 and its mammalian homologue isopeptidase T stimulate substrate degradation by the 26 S proteasome both in vitro (23Hadari T. Warms J.V.B. Rose I.A. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 719-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (24Amerik A.Y. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Yeast Doa4 is required for recycling ubiquitin from both proteasome-bound ubiquitinated intermediates and membrane proteins destined for destruction in the vacuole (25Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Several growth factor receptors such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), epidermal growth factor receptor, and hepatocyte growth factor receptor are ubiquitinated upon ligand stimulation (26Mori S. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Galcheva-Gargova Z. Theroux S.J. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2649-2655PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jeffers M. Taylor G.A. Weidner K.M. Omura S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It has been shown that proteasome inhibitors suppress degradation of PDGFR and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (28Jeffers M. Taylor G.A. Weidner K.M. Omura S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Okuyama Y. Saito Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that in addition to the lysosomal pathway, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in proteolytic degradation of growth factor receptors. Because the deletion mutant of Hbp lacking the SH3 domain shows dominant negative effects on degradation of PDGFR (5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), binding partners of the SH3 domain seem to positively regulate degradation of growth factor receptors. In the present study, UBPY has been shown to associate with Hbp through the SH3 domain both in vitro and in cultured cells. Thus, like Ubp14, isopeptidase T, and Doa4, UBPY associated with Hbp may play a positive regulatory role in proteasomal and/or lysosomal degradation of growth factor receptors, although its mechanism remains to be clarified. mUBPY has two Hbp-SH3 domain binding sites. Mutagenic analysis identified a consensus sequence, PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP, as the Hbp-SH3 domain binding motif. It does not contain the proline-rich consensus binding motif, PXXP (30Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). It is also distinct from the SH3-binding motif, PXXDY, which is found in Eps8-interacting proteins (14Mongiovi A.M. Romano P.R. Panni S. Mendoza M. Wong W.T. Musacchio A. Cesareni G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). There are six proline-rich sequences in mUBPY fitting the consensus sequence, PXXP, but they do not contribute to the interaction of mUBPY with the SH3 domain of Hbp, because the deletion mutant lacking the Hbp-SH3 domain binding motifs failed to bind. Thus, the novel SBM is essential for mUBPY to associate with Hbp. It remains unknown whether the motif alone is sufficient or another sequence is required for the association. Similar sequences to UBPY SBMs are also found in AMSH and members of the BLNK family and the GAB family. AMSH binds to the SH3 domain of STAM. Although a PXXP motif in AMSH was suggested to mediate the interaction of AMSH with the SH3 domain of STAM (9Tanaka N. Kaneko K. Asao H. Kasai H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takeshita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19129-19135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), our in vitro binding assay showed that the consensus sequence of SBM in AMSH contributes to the interaction. By a similar analysis, we showed that AMSH binds to the SH3 domain of Hbp via the SBM. Thus, the SBM present in AMSH seems to be essential for binding to SH3 domains of binding partners, although further examination is required to prove that it is functional in vivo. SLP-76, a member of the BLNK family, associates with Grb2 through the SH3 domain. Mapping of the Grb2-binding site has shown that it is located within amino acids 224–244 in SLP-76 (31Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The sequence contains 233PSIDRSTKP that matches the novel SBM, suggesting that the SBM in SLP-76 mediates the interaction of the protein with the SH3 domain of Grb2. Since SLP-76 plays a crucial role in T-cell receptor signaling through association with Grb2 (32Jackman J. Motto D. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C. Peltz G. Koretzky G. Findell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), the SBM in SLP-76 may be a functional sequence for protein-protein interaction in the signaling. Gab1, a member of the GAB family, also associates with Grb2 through the SH3 domain (33Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 34Fixman E.D. Holgado-Madruga M. Nguyen L. Kamikura D.M. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20167-20172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This association seems to be involved in regulation of growth factor signaling. Very recently, two Grb2-binding sites in Gab1 were identified. The first site matches the proline-rich consensus binding motif PXXP, while the second binding site constitutes the consensus sequence of SBM (35Schaeper U. Gehring N.H. Fuchs K.P. Sachs M. Kempkes B. Bichmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, the SBM in Gab1 may play an important role in Gab1-Grb2 interaction required for growth factor signaling. The novel SBM appears to be a crucial sequence to mediate protein-protein interactions through SH3 domains in some intracellular signaling pathways. We found by in vitro binding assay that the SBM of UBPY binds to the SH3 domains of Hbp and STAM and also to the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 but not to other SH3 domains examined. We also found that the SBM of AMSH binds to the SH3 domains of Hbp and STAM. These findings suggest that these SH3 domains specifically recognize the novel SBM. Thus, the SBMs of SLP-76 and Gab1 probably mediate association of these proteins with Grb2 through the C-terminal, but not N-terminal, SH3 domain. Amino acid sequence comparison shows that the SH3 domains of Hbp and STAM and the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 constitute three-dimensional structures similar to other SH3 domains, suggesting that the proline-rich consensus sequence PXXP is also recognized by these SH3 domains. In fact, the proline-rich consensus sequences in some proteins bind to the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (36den Hertog J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37She H-Y. Rockow S. Tang J. Nishimura R. Skolnik E.Y. Chen M. Margolis B. Li W. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21194-21202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), although such sequences recognized by the SH3 domains of Hbp and STAM have not been identified yet. Although similar three-dimensional structures are suggested, some amino acid residues are characteristic to the SH3 domains of Hbp and STAM and to the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 and are distinct from those in other SH3 domains. The SH3 domain of p53BP2, although it is able to recognize the proline-rich consensus sequences (39Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), interacts with p53 via a distinct peptide sequence (13Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Crystal structural analysis revealed that 3 amino acid residues in the RT loop of the SH3 domain of p53BP2 are critical to recognize the binding site of p53. Tyr469makes hydrogen bonds to Asn247 of p53, and Asp475 and Glu476 make charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds to Arg248 of p53 (13Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Similarly, amino acid residues characteristic in the SH3 domains of Hbp and STAM and the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 may contribute to interaction of the SH3 domains with the SBM. Crystal structural analysis will identify critical amino acid residues in the SH3 domains that interact with individual amino acids in the SBMs."

https://openalex.org/W1554841178,"One of the most striking universal properties of the high-transition-temperature (high-$T_c$) superconductors is that they are all derived from the hole-doping of their insulating antiferromagnetic (AF) parent compounds. From the outset, the intimate relationship between magnetism and superconductivity in these copper-oxides has intrigued researchers. Evidence for this link comes from neutron scattering experiments that show the unambiguous presence of short-range AF correlations (excitations) in cuprate superconductors. Even so, the role of such excitations in the pairing mechanism and superconductivity is still a subject of controversy. For YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, where $x$ controls the hole-doping level, the most prominent feature in the magnetic excitations spectra is the ``resonance''. Here we show that for underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.6}$, where $x$ and $T_c$ are below the optimal values, modest magnetic fields suppress the resonance significantly, much more so for fields approximately perpendicular rather than parallel to the CuO$_2$ planes. Our results indicate that the resonance measures pairing and phase coherence, suggesting that magnetism plays an important role in the superconductivity of cuprates. The persistence of a field effect above $T_c$ favors mechanisms with preformed pairs in the normal state of underdoped cuprates."
https://openalex.org/W2046997377,"Reducing luminal NaCl concentration in the macula densa region of the nephron stimulates renin secretion, and this response is blocked by a specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (Traynor, T. R., Smart, A., Briggs, J. P., and Schnermann, J. (1999) Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 277, F706–710). To study whether low NaCl activates COX-2 activity or expression we clonally derived a macula densa cell line (MMDD1 cells) from SV-40 transgenic mice using fluorescence-activated cell sorting of renal tubular cells labeled with segment-specific fluorescent lectins. MMDD1 cells express COX-2, bNOS, NKCC2, and ROMK, but not Tamm-Horsfall protein, and showed rapid86Rb+ uptake that was inhibited by a reduction in NaCl concentration and by bumetanide or furosemide. Isosmotic exposure of MMDD1 cells to low NaCl (60 mm) caused a prompt and time-dependent stimulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release that was prevented by the COX-2 specific inhibitor NS-398 (10 μm). Reducing NaCl to 60 and 6 mm for 16 h increased COX-2 expression in a chloride-dependent fashion. Low NaCl phosphorylated p38 kinase within 30 min and ERK1/2 kinases within 15 min without changing total MAP kinase levels. Low NaCl-stimulated PGE2 release and COX-2 expression was inhibited by SB 203580 and PD 98059 (10 μm), inhibitors of p38 and ERK kinase pathways. We conclude that low chloride stimulates PGE2 release and COX-2 expression in MMDD1 cells through activation of MAP kinases. Reducing luminal NaCl concentration in the macula densa region of the nephron stimulates renin secretion, and this response is blocked by a specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (Traynor, T.

Both the direct effects of angiotensin to cause vasoconstriction and to enhance tubular Na+ absorption and its indirect actions to regulate the production of aldosterone are major factors in renal Na+ conservation and blood pressure maintenance. The regulation of release and synthesis of renin by body salt content is multifactorial. The macula densa mechanism for control of renin secretion is an intrarenal control system in which a direct consequence of salt depletion, a reduced NaCl concentration in the macula densa segment of the nephron, elicits an activation of the renin-angiotensin system (2Vander A.J. Physiol. Rev. 1967; 47: 359-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In the mammalian kidney, the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle returns to its own glomerulus contacting the glomerular vascular pole with a plaque of epithelial cells, the macula densa (MD).1 The MD cells are in close contact with the vascular smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole and with the renin-producing granular cells. There is ample evidence that the MD cells act as receptors of luminal NaCl concentration and that a reduction in NaCl concentration results in stimulation of renin release and renin synthesis (3Skott O. Briggs J.P. Science. 1987; 237: 1618-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Substantial experimental evidence indicates that prostaglandins act as extracellular mediators of MD-dependent renin secretion. Prostaglandins of the E and I series have been shown to stimulate renin secretion in a number of preparations including in cultured JG cells (4Jensen B.L. Schmid C. Kurtz A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1996; 271: F659-F669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In animals with denervated kidneys, the response of renin to salt depletion or furosemide is significantly suppressed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (5Francisco L.L. Osborn J.L. DiBona G.F. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1982; 243: F537-F542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the perfused JGA preparation, low NaCl-induced renin secretion is completely blocked by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (6Greenberg S.G. Lorenz J.N. He X.R. Schnermann J.B. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1993; 265: F578-F583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the inducible COX-2 isoform in macula densa cells and adjacent thick ascending limb cells suggests that a reduction in luminal NaCl may cause increased COX-2-mediated production of prostaglandins which upon release interact with granular cells to stimulate renin release and renin synthesis. This hypothesis is fully compatible with the observation that in the perfused JGA the COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398 blocks low NaCl-stimulated renin release (1Traynor T.R. Smart A. Briggs J.P. Schnermann J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 277: F706-F710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, COX-2 inhibition has been shown to inhibit renin release in various high renin states such as salt depletion, ACE inhibition, and renal artery stenosis (7Harris R.C. McKanna J.A. Akai Y.

Progress in the understanding of the cellular mechanisms responsible for MD control of prostaglandin release has been hampered by the lack of an appropriate cell model. In this paper we report the development of a cell line with MD-like properties and its use in exploring the mechanisms that may mediate the direct effect of a change in medium NaCl concentration on prostaglandin release and COX-2 gene expression. Our results indicate that a reduction in luminal NaCl concentration causes the rapid phosphorylation of MAP kinases, and that MAP kinase activation is causal in the acute release of PGE2 as well as in the delayed rise in COX-2 mRNA and protein expression.

Mice transgenic for the SV40 large T-antigen (6-TgN(SV)7Bri) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). After decapsulation, the kidney cortex was minced and digested in a dissociation solution (0.25% trypsin, 0.15% collagenase A, and 50 mg/ml DNase I) at 37 °C with vigorous shaking for 1 h. The cells were further dissociated by pipetting the mixture 2–3 times during incubation. The cell suspension was filtered through a 20-μm mesh into a 50-ml centrifuge tube to remove any undigested tissue. The cells were resuspended in cell suspension solution (HBSS, 5% FBS/DNase I, 20 mg/ml) and washed twice with the same suspension solution. The cell suspension was adjusted to 5–10 × 10 5 cells/ml and incubated on ice for 30 min with FITC-conjugated Dolichos biflorus lectin recognizing sugar residues in collecting duct cells and phycoerythrin-conjugatedHelix pomatia lectin recognizing sugar residues on macula densa cells, collecting duct cells, and cells in S1 and S2 segments of proximal tubules solution (50 μg/ml in cell suspension solution). The cells were washed twice with cell suspension solution and analyzed by flow cytometry on a Coulter Elite ESP. Unlabeled cells were used for initial light scatter analysis. The cells were sorted based on their FITC and phycoerythrin fluorescence (Fig. 1 A). Cells that were phycoerythrin-positive and FITC-negative (left upper quadrant of the scatter diagram) were collected aseptically into culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 until confluent. The cells were then cloned by limiting dilution and 12 clones were grown to confluence and frozen in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in fetal bovine serum. Four of these clones were further screened for expression of macula densa cell markers by RT-PCR using positive and negative selection criteria. mRNAs of COX-2, bNOS, NKCC2, ROMK, and oxytocin receptors were chosen as positive selection markers while the expression of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), vasopressin receptor type 2 (V2R), and glucose-6-phosphatase (Glu-6-Pase) was used as negative selection criteria. MMDD1 cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Two protocols were used to reduce extracellular NaCl concentration. In the first protocol, confluent MMDD1 monolayers were exposed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in a 1:1 mixture with isotonic saline (control), 300 mm mannitol or raffinose (to reduce NaCl to half; LS solution 1), 150 mm Na gluconate (to reduce Cl− to half), or 167 mm choline chloride (to reduce Na+ to half). In the second protocol, solutions with Cl− concentrations of 73 (LS solution 2) and 6 mm (LS solution 3) were made by replacing NaCl with Na gluconate.

Influx was measured during a timed exposure of cells to regular influx medium (in mm: 135 NaCl, 5 RbCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 Na2HPO4, 2 Na2SO4, 15 HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1 ouabain) containing 1 μCi/ml 86RbCl. Cells were washed five times with an ice-cold high potassium solution. The cells were incubated in H2O for 5 min, scraped, and passed 3–5 times through a 23-gauge needle with a 3-ml syringe. 86Rb content was measured by scintillation counting, and protein content was determined by Coomassie protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). RT-PCR was performed as described previously (13Singh I. Grams M. Wang W.H. Yang T. Killen P. Smart A. Schnermann J. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol.

Renal Physiol. 1999; 277: F1-F9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primers used for vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R), glucose-6-phosphatase (Glu-6-Pase), and THP cDNA amplification were THP sense, 5′-CTGGATGTCCATAGTGACTC-3′ (bp 1161–1180), antisense, 5′-TGTGGCATAGCAGTTGGTCA-3′ (bp 1541–1560) (accession number NM_017082); V2R sense, 5′-TTTCAAGTGCTACCCCAGCT-3′ (bp 312–331), antisense, 5′-TTTGATTGCTGGGCCCGATT-3′ (bp 609–628) (accession number Z11932); G-6-Pase, sense, 5′-GAACGCCTTCTATGTCCTCT-3′ (bp 150–169), antisense, 5′-CACCGGAATCCATACGTTGA-3′ (bp 460–479) (accession number NM_013098). PCR reactions were performed in the presence of 1.5 μCi/50 μl of [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the product intensity was analyzed by phosphorimaging. Cells were lysed and subsequently sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.5). Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie reagent. 40 μg of protein from whole cell lysates was denatured in boiling water for 10 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, followed by incubation for 1 h with rabbit anti-murine polyclonal antiserum to COX-2 at a dilution of 1:1000. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, blots were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with ECL kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The confluent MMDD1 cells in 6-well plate were lysed by sonication for 10 s in 300 μl of 1 × Laemmli sample buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 1.4% SDS, and 40 mm dithiothreitol (pH 6.8). The protein samples were heated at 60 °C for 15 min and electrophoresis was performed as described above. The blots were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h. The primary antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-p38 at a dilution of 1:1000 were incubated overnight a 4 °C. The secondary antibody and ECL reaction were the same as described above. The blots were stripped in 0.2 m NaOH for 4 min and reprobed with antibodies against total ERK1/2 or total p38 with a similar immunoblotting procedure. PGE2 in the culture media was measured with an enzyme immunoassay kit. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 25 or 50 μl of the medium, along with a serial dilution of PGE2 standard samples were mixed with appropriate amounts of acetylcholinesterase-labeled tracer and PGE2 antiserum, and incubated at room temperature for 18 h. After the wells were emptied and rinsed with wash buffer, 200 μl of Ellman's reagent containing substrate for acetylcholinesterase was added. The enzyme reaction was carried out on a slow shaker at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were read at 415 nm and the results were analyzed by KC4 software (Bio-Tek Instrument, Inc.). Confluent MMDD1 cells grown on glass coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber (40 μl volume) and perfused at about 5 μl/s. The composition of the bath solution was changed through a manifold at the entrance of the perfusion chamber. Experiments were performed on an inverted microscope (Diaphot, Nikon, Melville NY) equipped with differential interference contrast combined with low light level fluorescence as described previously (15Xia P. Bungay P.M. Gibson C.C. Kovbasnjuk O.N. Spring K.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 3302-3312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Preparations were imaged using a 100x/1.3 N.A lens, and an intensified CCD camera (ICCD-1001, Video Scope, Sterling VA). The normal salt solution (NS) contained (in mm): NaCl, 135; KCl, 4.2; CaCl2, 1; Na2HPO4, 1; Na2SO4, 2; HEPES, 15. The composition of the low salt solution (LS) was the same except that NaCl was reduced to 20 and 230 mm mannitol was added to maintain isotonicity. For calcium measurements cells were incubated for 15 min with the calcium fluorophore Fluo-4-AM (5 μm) at 37 °C (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After removing extracellular fluorophore by washing and a 10-min de-esterification period the Fluo-4 signal was monitored continuously at a sampling rate of 0.5 Hz during the change of the perfusion medium from NS to LS (excitation at 477 nm, emission at 520 nm). The responsiveness of the system was checked by treatment of the cells with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (10 μm). For pH measurements cells were incubated for 10 min with BCECF-AM (5 μm) at 37 °C (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Intracellular pH was determined as the excitation ratio signal (488/458 nm) monitored continuously at a sampling rate of 0.1 Hz. During the medium change from NS to LS the sampling rate was increased to 0.5 Hz. The responsiveness of the system was checked by the response of intracellular pH to an ammonium chloride pulse (30 mm). Values shown represent mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test or ANOVA with Bonferroni correction with a p value of less than 0.05 being considered statistically significant. All experiments reported in this study were performed on cells derived from a clone that fulfilled both positive and negative selection criteria by expressing mRNAs of COX-2, bNOS, NKCC2, ROMK, and OT receptors (not shown), but not of THP, V2R, and Glu-6-Pase (Fig.1 B). THP was used as a marker for TAL and DCT, V2R as a marker of TAL and collecting duct cells, and Glu-6-Pase as a marker for PCT. In addition to the initial selection by RT-PCR, expression of COX-2, bNOS, NKCC2, and ROMK was confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting (Fig.2). The bNOS antibody recognized a 100-kDa protein, smaller than the expected size of 155 kDa; nevertheless, antibody binding was completely prevented by pretreatment with bNOS peptide. Cells derived from this clone were designated as MMDD1 cells. After expansion and several initial passages, experiments were performed on cells at passages 5–10. Confluent MMDD1 cells have an epithelial, cobblestone morphology in phase contrast light microscopy (Fig. 3). Electrical resistance of confluent MMDD1 cells was in the order of 100 Ω/cm2, substantially lower than that of M1 or mIMCD-K2 cells, cell lines derived from cortical and medullary collecting ducts, respectively (16Kizer N.L. Lewis B. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1995; 268: F347-F355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Stoos B.A. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Carretero O.A. Ito S. Fejes-Toth G.

MMDD1 cells were found to be cytokeratin positive and vimentin negative confirming their epithelial nature (data not shown). Furthermore, MMDD1 cells retained the ability to bindH. pomatia lectin, and specificity of binding was confirmed by the finding that preincubation with the competing sugarN-acetyl-d-galactosamine (500 μg/ml) eliminated binding of H. pomatia lectin to MMDD1 cells (data not shown).Figure 3Morphology of MMDD1 cells by phase-contrast (left) or Hoffman (right) light microscopy (× 200).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The existence of a functional NKCC2 transporter in MMDD1 cells was confirmed by determining bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb uptake in the presence of ouabain to prevent entry of 86Rb through the Na/K pump. We found measurable uptake of 86Rb within seconds and the uptake was linear for about 10 min (Fig.4 A). Bumetanide in the 10–100 μm concentration range significantly inhibited86Rb uptake in a dose-dependent manner with maximal inhibition being achieved at 60 μm (Fig.4 B). 86Rb uptake was also inhibited by furosemide with maximal inhibition being produced by a concentration of 200 μm (data not shown). 86Rb uptake was inversely related to the NaCl concentration of the medium (Fig.4 C). To study the time course of the effect of low NaCl on PGE2 release and COX-2 expression, confluent MMDD1 cells were incubated in normal salt and low salt medium for 1, 3, 6, and 16 h. Isosmotic normal and low salt medium was made by mixing equal volumes of serum-free culture medium with saline (control), or 300 mm mannitol (low NaCl, LS). Incubation in LS medium induced a rapid and significant increase of PGE2release rate that caused a statistically significant increase in medium PGE2 concentration at 1 h (Fig.5 A). A significant stimulation of COX-2 protein expression was observed at 3 h and further induction was observed at the later time points (Fig. 5 B). PGE2 release by low salt was virtually abolished by the COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398 (10 μm), and by the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 μm) (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on low NaCl-stimulated PGE2 production. MMDD1 cells were treated by normal or low NaCl medium (LS solution 1) for 16 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm NS-398 or indomethacin (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of the nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein on PGE2 release consisted of a complete inhibition of the stimulatory effect of low NaCl (Fig.7). In fact, genistein reduced PGE2 release below basal levels. To determine if a reduction in Na+ or Cl− was responsible for the low NaCl effect on COX-2 expression, confluent MMDD1 cells were incubated in normal salt and low salt medium for 16 h. Isosmotic normal and low salt medium was made by mixing equal volumes of serum-free culture medium with saline (control), 300 mm mannitol or raffinose (to reduce NaCl), 150 mm Na gluconate (to reduce Cl), or 167 mm choline chloride (to reduce Na+). In these experiments MMDD1 cells at passages 5–10 were used. Compared with normal salt control, replacement of NaCl with mannitol or raffinose caused a significant induction of COX-2 protein levels (Fig.8 A). Replacement of Cl− with gluconate had a similar stimulatory effect (Fig.8 A). In contrast, replacement of Na+ with choline did not induce COX-2 expression (Fig. 8 A). Densitometric values are: 20.5 ± 5.4 in NS group, 48.3 ± 11.2 in low NaCl (with mannitol) group (n = 8,p = 0.002 versus NS), 48.5 ± 4.0 in low NaCl (with raffinose) group (n = 8,p < 0.001 versus NS), 36.3 ± 5.8 in low Cl− group (n = 7, p = 0.001). To address the concern that the stimulation of COX-2 might be due to a specific effect of the added carbohydrate, the effect of glucose on COX-2 expression was examined. Glucose at 15 and 25 mm in serum-free medium was without an effect on COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 8 B). The low salt stimulation of COX-2 expression in MMDD1 cells appeared to be a cell type-specific phenomenon because the same treatment had no effect on COX-2 expression in mIMCD-K2 cells, a cell line derived from the inner medullary collecting duct (Fig. 8 C). Bumetanide (120 and 240 μm) and furosemide (220 and 420 μm) augmented COX-2 expression (Fig. 8 D). To further characterize the low Cl− effect on COX-2 expression and PGE2 release, the dose response to varying Cl− concentrations was examined. COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 9 A) and PGE2release (Fig. 9 B) was found to increase in a dose-dependent manner when medium Cl−concentration was reduced to 73 and 6 mm. To study the role of MAP kinases in mediation of low salt stimulation of COX-2 expression in MMDD1 cells, experiments were carried out to test whether exposure to low salt or low Cl− stimulates MAP kinase activity and whether inhibition of MAP kinases with pharmacological inhibitors suppresses the stimulation of COX-2 expression by low salt. ERK1/2 and p38 activity was assessed by phosphorylation of MAP kinases using antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 and p38. PD 98059 and SB 203580 were used to interfere with MEK1/2 and p38, respectively. Low Cl− (6 mm) treatment markedly increased phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and p38 in a time-dependent manner while total ERK1/2 and p38 were not changed (Fig.10). Low salt treatment (1:1 mixing serum-free medium with isotonic mannitol) also increased phosphorylation of the two kinases (data not shown). SB 203580 at 10 μm reduced low salt stimulated COX-2 expression by 60% and PD 98059 at 10 μm abolished the stimulation (Fig.11).Figure 11Effect of the p38 inhibitor SB 203580 (at 10 and 20 μm) and of the p44/42 pathway inhibitor PD 98059 (at 10 μm) on low NaCl-induced COX-2 expression.

Changing the extracellular medium from control to low NaCl solution (20 mm NaCl) while maintaining isotonicity did not affect intracellular Ca2+ concentration in MMDD1 cells. Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity gradually declined to a gray level of 93.4 ± 28.7, but this fall could not be distinguished from the bleach rate of the probe. No Ca2+transients were detected, nor was there a change in Ca2+that developed with a slower time course. In MMDD1 cells exposed to the ionophore A23187 (10 μm), Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity increased markedly. A slight and slowly developing acidification was observed when the control NaCl solution was changed to the low NaCl perfusate with BCECF fluorescence intensity in gray level units falling from 2.56 ± .27 to 2.25 ± .22 (10 experiments with 38 cells; p < 0.05 by paired t test). The measurements of pH were validated by the prompt and marked alkalinization caused by exposure of the cells to an ammonium chloride pulse. MD cells are specialized tubular epithelial cells that play a central role in NaCl-dependent control of glomerular arteriolar tone and renin release. Despite their paucity and inaccessibility, substantial progress has been made using electrophysiological and fluorescent techniques in defining their membrane characteristics and transport functions (18Bell P.D. Lapointe J.Y. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1997; 24: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Lapointe J.Y. Laamarti A. Bell P.D. Kidney Int.

However, understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the generation and release of cell-specific signaling molecules requires availability of MD cells in quantities sufficient for biochemical analysis. In the present study we report the development of a new cell line with MD characteristics and its use in determining the role of MAP kinases in the stimulation of PGE2 release and COX-2 expression by low medium NaCl. A number of cell lines from different parts of the nephron have been established in recent years using SV-40 transgenic mice (16Kizer N.L. Lewis B. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol.

Immortal tubular epithelial cell lines were derived from defined microdissected tubular segments or from tissue enriched in the desired tubule segment. Attempts in our laboratory to develop an MD cell line from microdissected MD specimen have not been successful because of overgrowth with other cells, presumably of mesangial origin. In the present paper we have used a different strategy to obtain a cell clone with MD-like properties. Differential labeling of H. pomatialectin with phycoerythrin and D. biflorus lectin with FITC permitted separation of Helix and Dolichospositive cells by FAC sorting.

G protein-coupled receptor endothelial differentiation gene sphingosine 1-phosphate lysophosphatidic acid transmembrane helix guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate Molecular Operating Environment The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 superfamily includes more than 2000 genes encoding receptors for bioactive molecules ranging from hormones through neurotransmitters (1Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E133-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of these ligands makes GPCRs the target of many drugs and the subject of drug development studies. GPCRs are integral membrane proteins with physical properties that vastly increase the difficulty of standard methods of structure analysis. A precise understanding of their ligand-receptor interactions is essential for the rational design of ligands. Therefore, an atomic resolution map of the binding pocket including the locations of the interactions necessary for ligand binding would provide crucial drug development information. The endothelial differentiation gene (Edg) receptors are GPCRs that are activated by lysophospholipids (Fig. 1). Five members of the Edg family (Edg1, Edg3, Edg5, Edg6, and Edg8) show a preference for sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) (2An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J.

Therefore, receptors for SPP are important targets for the design of receptor-specific ligands both as potential therapeutic agents and to assist in the elucidation of the physiological function of the receptor. Membership of the Edg receptors in the GPCR family confers significant homology with other GPCRs in regard to sequence, topology, and function (14Van Rhee A.M. Jacobson K.A. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 37: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These shared features make the Edg receptors good candidates for homology modeling. Homology modeling uses a known template protein structure to build an analogous structure for a protein sequence having unknown structure. Homology modeling thus assumes that homologous function and amino acid sequences confer three-dimensional structural similarity. GPCRs have extracellular amino termini, intracellular carboxyl termini, and seven alpha-helical domains that span the cell membrane. These shared structural features provide strong constraints for molecular model development. The GPCRs sharing the greatest homology with the Edg receptors are the cannabinoid receptors, which have been previously modeled based on a low resolution structure of rhodopsin (15Bramblett R.D. Panu A.M. Ballesteros J.A. Reggio P.H. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Tao G. McAllister S.D. Andreassi J. Nowell K.W. Cabral G.A. Hurst D.P. Bachtel K.

The success of these post hoc studies in aiding the interpretation of pharmacological data and in predicting the impact of site mutations has encouraged us to undertake a model-driven approach to study the interaction between Edg1 and its natural ligand, SPP. Edg1 was selected for our initial work because it shares significant homology with both the SPP- and LPA-specific members of the family and will serve as a good template for modeling the other Edg receptors. SPP and LPA were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Anti-flag M2 antibody and horseradish peroxidase- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse were purchased from Sigma. The Edg1 model was developed using homology modeling in the MOE program (Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada). The corrected Edg1 sequence from GenBankTM (accession number AFF43420) was aligned against the transmembrane helices (THs) of a rhodopsin model (Protein Data Bank entry 1boj (17Pogozheva I.D. Lomize A.L. Mosberg H.I. Biophys. J. 1997; 70: 1963-1985Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (143) Google Scholar)). The amino-terminal 30 and carboxyl-terminal 50 residues were deleted, because no template structure was available for these regions. Manual realignments were made to remove gaps in the THs. The structure of the seventh TH of the dopamine D2 receptor was obtained from Dr. H. Weinstein (18Konvicka K. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and mutated to produce the corresponding TH for Edg1. This modified structure was substituted into the template structure for homology modeling. The preliminary model was refined by converting cis-amide bonds in the loops totrans-amide bonds and by manually rotating side chains at polarity-conserved positions (19Zhang D. Weinstein H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to optimize hydrogen bonding between the THs. Geometry optimization was performed with the AMBER94 force field (20Cornell W.D.

Interhelical hydrogen bonds formed that were retained upon minimization connect helices 1 and 2 (Asn63 to Asp91), 2 and 3 (Asn86to Ser134), 2 and 4 (Asn86 to Trp168), 2 and 7 (Asp91 to Ser304), 3 and 7 (Ser131 to Ser304), and 4 and 5 (Trp182 to His2O1). Docking of SPP was performed using the docking module in MOE with a docking box encompassing the majority of Edg1. Partial charges on protein atoms were applied from AMBER94 force field, and those on SPP atoms were generated using the semi-empirical AM1 method (21Dewar M.J.S. Zoebisch E.G. Healy E.F.

These geometries were evaluated using the criteria from our previous modeling studies using the incorrect Edg1 sequence (GenBankTM accession number M31210; Refs. 22Bautista D.L. Baker D.L. Wang D.

Geometry optimization of the best complex obtained with the correct Edg-1 sequence (accession number AFF43420) was performed to a 0.01 root mean square gradient after manual optimization of ion-pairing interactions. The amino-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged Edg1 receptor construct (GenBankTM accession number AF233365) was obtained from Dr. T. Hla.

The following day, the transfection medium was replaced with 3 ml of fresh medium. The cells were used the next day for ligand binding and receptor activation assays. The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line (ATCC) does not endogenously express the Edg1 receptor and has been used for the heterologous expression of SPP receptors (6Lee M.-J. Van Brocklyn J.R.

The Edg1 mutants were tested for SPP binding after transient transfection into HEK293 cells as described previously (6Lee M.-J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R.

Transfected cells were homogenized in 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5). Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2 and stored at −80 °C. 5 μg of membrane protein from Edg1 receptor expressing RH7777 cells was incubated in 1.0 ml of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 nm[35S]GTPγS (1191 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)). After incubating for 30 min at 30 °C, bound radioactivity was separated by rapid vacuum filtration through a Whatman GF/B glass filter, and determined by liquid scintillation counting of triplicate samples. For Western blot analysis, lysates from 24-h transfected cells were collected after an 8-h serum starvation, separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The primary antibody was the FLAG epitope tag-specific M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma, 1:500 dilution), and the secondary antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma, 1:4000 dilution). The bound antibody was visualized using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). RH7777 cells transfected with empty vector or plasmids containing Edg1 construct inserts were cultured on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. After an 18-h serum starvation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% NaN3 at 4 °C. The anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:3000 dilution at 4 °C for 12 h. Following three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with a 1:750 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted with Aqua-Mount (Lerner Laboratories, Pittsburgh, PA). For ligand-induced receptor internalization experiments, following 18 h of serum starvation, the cells were treated with 100 nmSPP at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were fixed, and the receptor protein was localized with indirect immunofluorescence using the anti-FLAG antibody as described above. Immunofluorescence staining was viewed by laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss laser scanning system LSM 510. A preliminary homology model of Edg1 was developed from a model of bovine rhodopsin (16Tao G. McAllister S.D. Andreassi J. Nowell K.W. Cabral G.A. Hurst D.P. Bachtel K. Ekman M.C. Reggio P.H. Abood M.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 605-613PubMed Google Scholar) that is consistent with the 9-Å resolution structural data on the rhodopsin molecule (the best structural information available at the time model development began; Ref. 26Schertler G.F.X. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The preliminary model was refined by manually optimizing the interhelical network of hydrogen bonds at polarity-conserved positions followed by energy minimization (19Zhang D. Weinstein H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonds formed that were retained upon minimization connect helices 1 and 2 (Asn63 to Asp91), 2 and 3 (Asn86 to Ser134), 2 and 4 (Asn86 to Trp168), 2 and 7 (Asp91 to Ser304), 3 and 7 (Ser131to Ser304), and 4 and 5 (Trp182 to His2O1). The refined model was used in automated docking studies with SPP to generate a model of their complex. The model complex most consistent with the available data on the ligand selectivity of the Edg1 receptor shows three different ion-pairing interactions with the SPP head-group (Fig. 2 C). Two of these involve cationic amino acids, Arg120 and Arg292, predicted to be within 2 Å of the anionic phosphate group of SPP. The third involves an anionic amino acid, Glu121, positioned within 2.5 Å of the positively charged ammonium group of the sphingosine backbone. These ion-pairing interactions can provide an explanation of why the Edg1 receptor shows a strong preference for SPP over LPA, a glycerophospholipid that lacks an ammonium substituent. LPA is unable to ion-pair with Glu121, leaving the carboxylate of Glu121 within 5 Å of the anionic phosphate of LPA with no counterion to mitigate the repulsive interaction between the two. The theoretical model of the complex between Edg1 and SPP has been compared with the recently published 2.8-Å resolution crystal structure of the inactive form of bovine rhodopsin (27Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation is 3.4 Å for the alpha carbon positions in the helical domains of these structures. A notably similar feature shared by the experimental structure of rhodopsin and the theoretical model of Edg1 is the network of interhelical hydrogen bonds formed by amino acids at corresponding positions. Table Ishows these common interhelical hydrogen bonding networks using helical reference numbers (28Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Conn P.M. Sealfon S.C. Methods in Neurosciences. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 366-428Google Scholar) to point out the correspondence between the different sequences. The first part of each label is the number of the helix in which the residue appears. The second part of each label refers to its position in that helix relative to the most conserved residue in that helix, which is given the number 50. Notably, both structures involve the same residues, 1.50, 2.50, and 7.46, in a hydrogen bonding network. The rhodopsin structure (1F88 in the Protein Data Bank) has the backbone carbonyl of residue 7.46 occupying a central role, hydrogen bonding with both an asparagine (1.50) and a glutamate (2.50) side chain. This arrangement would require a protonated glutamate as shown in Fig. 3 A. The Edg1 model has glutamate 2.50 occupying the central role, hydrogen bonding with the asparagine (1.50) and serine (7.46) side chains. The arrangement in the Edg1 model uses glutamate in its anionic form (Fig. 3 B), which would not be possible in the rhodopsin sequence because the side chain of alanine 7.46 cannot donate a hydrogen bond. A second trio of residues in both structures mediates hydrogen bonds among helices 2, 3, and 4. In both structures asparagine 2.45 occupies a central role, hydrogen bonding with side chains of residues serine 3.42 and tryptophan 4.50. The rhodopsin structure includes an additional hydrogen bond between asparagine 2.45 and the side chain of threonine 4.49 that does not appear in the Edg1 model.Table IComparison of interhelical hydrogen bonding networks in the 2.8-A˙resolution rhodopsin crystal structure and the theoretical Edg 1 receptor modelHydrogen bonding residuesHelical reference numbers 1-aHelical reference numbers include a two-part label.

Open table in a new tab Although the Edg1 model shares several features with the crystal structure of rhodopsin, there are also several notable differences between the structures. These may reflect deficiencies in the model, structural differences that arise because of the sequence differences between the two proteins, or differences between the inactive and active forms of the GPCR structures examined. The most notable difference is in the SPP binding pocket predicted by the Edg1 model. The position of the SPP phosphate in the Edg1 model is occupied by the extracellular beta sheet (β4) that forms the top of the retinal binding site in the rhodopsin structure. The residues in rhodopsin (glutamine 3.26, glutamine 3.29, and phenylalanine 7.34) corresponding to the residues predicted by the Edg1 model to ion-pair with the phosphate of SPP (arginine 3.26, glutamine 3.29, and arginine 7.34) are thus oriented more toward neighboring helices or even outside the helical bundle to make room for β4. Validation of the theoretical model of the Edg1 complex with SPP involved the generation of eight site mutations and evaluation of the ability of SPP to bind and activate these mutant receptors. Five of the site mutations, R120A, R292A, R292V, E121A, and E121Q, were designed specifically to evaluate the importance of the residues shown by the model to ion-pair with SPP. Two of these mutations, R292V and E121Q, introduced residues that are found in the corresponding positions in the LPA receptors of the Edg family. The other three site mutations, K111A, N101K, and N101I, were designed as controls to verify that changes in charge and other properties near to, but outside, the predicted binding pocket do not have as dramatic an impact on the ability of SPP to bind to, and activate the mutant receptors. In the model, Lys111 and Asn101 are 20.2 and 7.1 Å, respectively, from the docked phosphate and are not predicted to interact with SPP. The level of expression and proper targeting of each mutant to the plasma membrane was verified by Western blots and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using monoclonal antibodies recognizing an amino-terminal FLAG epitope (Fig. 4,A and B). The mutants showed expression levels and localization patterns similar to the wild type Edg1. Fig. 5 shows the results of the radioligand binding assays for the wild type Edg1 receptor and the site mutants. Each mutation of an ion-pairing residue showed specific binding dramatically less than the wild type Edg1 receptor and similar to that of the vector-transfected controls. The binding results to mutants R120A, R292A, R292V, E121A, and E121Q showed no concentration dependence in the nanomolar range (data not shown), preventing Scatchard analysis to calculate Kd values.Figure 5Radioligand binding assays of SPP with the Edg1 receptor and Edg1 mutants expressed in HEK293 cells using 1 nm radiolabeled SPP and 1 μm unlabeled SPP.

To verify that the mutations have similar effects on ligand binding and subsequent receptor activation and have not caused constitutive activation, receptor activation was assessed using a ligand-induced [35S]GTPγS binding assay. Fig. 6 A demonstrates that four of the mutations to the proposed ion-pairing residues, R120A, R292A, R292V, and E121A, all produce a receptor that SPP is unable to activate at concentrations up to 100 nm. Calculated EC50concentrations for each mutant are shown in Fig. 6 B. These results confirm and extend those from the radioligand binding assays that demonstrated that the receptor was unable to specifically bind SPP at a concentration of 1 nm. The fifth mutation involving an ion-pairing residue, E121Q, is a mutation that changes a residue conserved in the SPP binding Edg receptor subfamily (Edg1, -3, -5, -6, and -8) to a residue conserved in the LPA binding subfamily (Edg2, -4, and -7). This mutation, only at the maximal 1 μm ligand concentration, showed a slight but detectable 17% activation relative to the response of the wild type receptor, indicating that the glutamine residue is able to interact somewhat with the protonated 2-amino group of SPP, perhaps by hydrogen bonding. It should be noted that this result is not in conflict with the radioligand binding assay, which was performed at an 8-fold lower concentration than the 8.1 nm Kd for SPP on the Edg1 receptor (6Lee M.-J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) and gives a higher background in the higher concentration range due to the hydrophobic nature of the ligand. The control mutations K111A, N101K, and N101I showed activation results that were expected based on the radioligand binding results and were similar to that of the wild type Edg1. Activation of a GPCR is terminated by ligand-induced internalization of the receptor, which can be followed by the translocation of the epitope-tagged receptor from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. In complete agreement with the results of the [35S]GTPγS binding assay, mutants of the predicted ion-pairing residues did not show internalization (Fig. 7), indicating that they were not activated during the prolonged 15-min incubation with the 100 nm physiological concentration of the ligand. This is in contrast to the control mutations, which produced receptors that were activated and internalized by SPP treatment under the same conditions. Starting from the DNA-derived amino acid sequence, a theoretical model of the Edg1 receptor and its complex with SPP has been developed. The Edg1 receptor model demonstrates an interhelical hydrogen bonding network that is very similar to that found in the recently reported 2.8-Å resolution crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (27Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Docking studies with this model have predicted that SPP best fits into a pocket formed within the helical bundle, a region that has been experimentally identified as the ligand binding pocket for several GPCRs (14Van Rhee A.M. Jacobson K.A. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 37: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The model predicts three ion-pairing interactions critical to the recognition of SPP by Edg1. These include two ion pairs between cationic amino acids, Arg120 and Arg292, and the anionic phosphate of SPP, as well as a single ion pair between an anionic amino acid, Glu121, and the protonated amino group of SPP. The importance of these ion-pairing interactions identified by the model has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent radioligand binding assays for both specific binding of SPP by the receptor and receptor activation. There are 42 basic amino acids (19 of them are arginine) and 20 acidic amino acids (10 of them are glutamate) in the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of Edg1. Thus identification of the critical residues involved in ion pairing by either random or alanine/cysteine-scanning mutagenesis would have been prohibitive. Several studies have delineated the specificity of ligand recognition by the Edg1 receptor. Non-phosphorylated sphingosine derivatives (sphingosine, sphinganine, ceramide) have been demonstrated not to compete with the binding of SPP and/or not to activate the receptor. Phospholipids lacking a basic amine (sphingomyelin, LPA, lysophosphatidyl inositol) also fail either to compete with SPP binding or to activate the receptor at physiologically relevant concentrations. Additionally, SPP-phosphonate, having one less atom between the cationic and anionic moieties, was unable to compete with SPP (29Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.-J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L.

Of the many compounds evaluated for Edg1 interaction, only dihydro-SPP (29Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.-J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Liu C.H.

Dihydro-SPP and SPP-homophosphonate were almost as effective as SPP itself at displacing radiolabeled SPP, whereas sphingosylphosphorylcholine was 1–2 orders of magnitude weaker in binding affinity. These studies collectively demonstrate that the anionic phosphate and cationic amino groups, as well as the distance between them, are critical components of the interaction between SPP and Edg1. The predicted interactions also provide insight into the ligand selectivity differences within the Edg receptor family. Relevant portions of the amino acid sequences of Edg1 through Edg8 have been aligned and are shown in Fig. 8. The SPP-specific receptors, Edg1, -3, -5, -6, and -8, all share an anionic residue that corresponds to the Glu121 residue in the Edg1 receptor predicted by the model to interact with the ammonium of SPP. The LPA-specific receptors, Edg2, -4, and -7, instead have a neutral glutamine residue at that position that could interact with the neutral hydroxyl group in LPA. Our work demonstrates the applicability of computational modeling to correctly predict the critical ionic interactions defining the ligand binding pocket of a GPCR, thus supporting the utility of a model-driven approach to gene function. The model also lays the foundation for the rational design of therapeutic agents targeted at Edg1. The dopamine D2 receptor helix 7 structure was generously provided by Prof. Harel Weinstein (Mt.

https://openalex.org/W2012928472,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) constitute a unique subclass of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that bear little sequence homology to other members of the GPCR superfamily. The mGluR subtypes that are coupled to the hydrolysis of phosphoinositide contribute to both synaptic plasticity and glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in neurons. In the present study, the expression of mGluR1a in HEK 293 cells led to agonist-independent cell death. Since G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) desensitize a diverse variety of GPCRs, we explored whether GRKs contributed to the regulation of both constitutive and agonist-stimulated mGluR1a activity and thereby may prevent mGluR1a-mediated excitotoxicity associated with mGluR1a overactivation. We find that the co-expression of mGluR1a with GRK2 and GRK5, but not GRK4 and GRK6, reduced both constitutive and agonist-stimulated mGluR1a activity. Agonist-stimulated mGluR1a phosphorylation was enhanced by the co-expression of GRK2 and was blocked by two different GRK2 dominant-negative mutants. Furthermore, GRK2-dependent mGluR1a desensitization protected against mGluR1a-mediated cell death, at least in part by blocking mGluR1a-stimulated apoptosis. Our data indicate that as with other members of the GPCR superfamily, a member of the structurally distinct mGluR family (mGluR1a) serves as a substrate for GRK-mediated phosphorylation and that GRK-dependent ""feedback"" modulation of mGluR1a responsiveness protects against pathophysiological mGluR1a signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2015491183,"STAT6 mediates interleukin-4 (IL-4)-dependent positive and negative regulation of inflammatory gene expression. In the present report we examined the molecular mechanisms involved in IL-4-induced repression of reporter gene transcription driven by STAT1 and/or NF-κB. Transient expression of STAT6 in a STAT6-deficient cell line (HEK 293) conferred sensitivity to IL-4 for STAT6-dependent transcription and for repression of interferon-γ (IFNγ)/STAT1- and/or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)/NF-κB-driven reporter gene expression. In cells transfected with a deletion mutant of STAT6 lacking its transactivating domain, IL-4 could not mediate either positive or negative control of reporter gene expression. Overexpression of CREB-binding protein dramatically enhanced IL-4/STAT6-stimulated transcription and overcame IL-4-mediated repression of TNFα/NF-κB-dependent but not IFNγ/STAT1-dependent transcription. A single amino acid change in the DNA-binding domain of STAT6 (H415A) selectively reduced the affinity of STAT6 for IL-4-responsive STAT sequence motifs (N4) without affecting the affinity for IFNγ-responsive (GAS) sequences (N3) and, accordingly, eliminated transcription from an IL-4-responsive promoter. Interestingly, this mutation eliminated IL-4-mediated suppression of reporter gene transcription stimulated by TNFα/NF-κB but retained nearly full capacity to suppress IFNγ/STAT1-stimulated transcription. Taken together these results demonstrate that STAT6 mediates suppression of STAT1 and NF-κB-dependent transcription by distinct mechanisms. Both processes are dependent upon the STAT6 transactivation domain and may involve sequestration of necessary but different transcriptional coactivator proteins. These two suppressive mechanisms are controlled differentially by the nature of the STAT6 DNA-binding site (i.e. N3 versus N4).

Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are phosphorylated at a single tyrosine residue via members of the Jak kinase family following ligand-receptor interaction, assemble in dimeric form, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to specific DNA sequence motifs (13Darnell Jr., J.E.

Prototypically, IFNγ activates STAT1 homodimers that bind to IFNγ activation sequences (GAS) composed of two inverted repeats separated by three intervening nucleotides (N3 site, TTCnnnGAA) and promote transcription of IFNγ-responsive genes (14Schindler C.

Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. We have previously demonstrated that IL-4 does not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, nor DNA binding activity of STAT1 and that STAT6 is required for inhibition of IFNγ-inducible gene transcription in mouse macrophages (26Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5474-5482PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29202-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because the cis-elements required for IFNγ-induced transcription (ISRE, GAS, and γRE) are also sufficient for IL-4-mediated inhibition and because STAT6 homodimers are capable of binding to these sites without transactivating function (26Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5474-5482PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29202-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 36Deng W. Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2130-2136PubMed Google Scholar), it has been suggested that inhibition might involve competition between transactivating STAT1 and non-transactivating STAT6 for the N3 sites found in the promoters of sensitive genes (26Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5474-5482PubMed Google Scholar). An analogous mechanism has been reported for inhibition of E-selectin gene transcription by IL-4, where STAT6 competes with NF-κB for an overlapping binding site (37Bennett B.L. Cruz R. Lacson R.G. Manning A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10212-10219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A second hypothesis is that IL-4-activated STAT6 competes with STAT1 for limiting quantities of transcriptional coactivators such as the CREB-binding protein (CBP) (35Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29202-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that repression of AP-1-dependent transcription by nuclear hormone receptor or STAT1 results from competition for limiting amounts of the coactivator CBP/p300 (38Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Consistent with this are several reports demonstrating that CBP can interact with both STAT1 and STAT6 and can function as coactivator for both STAT1- and STAT6-driven transcription (35Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29202-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 40Gingras S. Simard J. Groner B. Pfitzner E.

In contrast to such direct effects, STAT6 may also function indirectly in negative regulation of transcription. A recent report demonstrated that the transactivating domain of STAT6 is required to suppress IFNγ-stimulated transcription (42Goenka S. Youn J. Dzurek L.M. Schindler U., Yu- Lee L.Y. Boothby M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4663-4672PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of CBP did not, however, overcome this suppression suggesting the following: 1) that competition for CBP was not the mechanism of suppression and 2) that STAT6 might mediate suppression indirectly through induction of a gene product that can inhibit IFNγ-induced transcription (42Goenka S. Youn J. Dzurek L.M. Schindler U., Yu- Lee L.Y. Boothby M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4663-4672PubMed Google Scholar).The present study was undertaken to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which IL-4-activated STAT6 inhibits IFNγ- and TNFα-induced interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) (43Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Harada H. Sudo Y. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1988; 54: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) gene transcription. The results demonstrate that reconstitution of STAT6 expression in a STAT6-deficient cell line confers sensitivity to IL-4-mediated repression of IFNγ- and TNFα-induced gene transcription. Consistent with and extending prior work, deletion of the STAT6 transactivation domain (TAD) abrogates its potential to suppress both IFNγ/STAT1- and TNFα/NF-κB-mediated transcription. Overexpression of CBP can overcome suppression of NF-κB- but not STAT1-driven transcription. A STAT6 mutant protein that contains a single amino acid change in the DNA-binding domain is unable to drive transcription from an IL-4-responsive promoter (N4) and to repress NF-κB-dependent transcription but retains the capacity for inhibition of IFNγ/STAT1-driven transcription. These findings demonstrate that IL-4, via activation of STAT6, can suppress inflammatory gene transcription through distinct mechanisms that may involve sequestration of transcriptional coactivators. This activity is dependent upon the specificity and avidity of DNA binding.DISCUSSIONIL-4 antagonizes IFNγ-induced gene expression, at least in part, through modulation of transcription (26Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5474-5482PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gautam S. Tebo J.M. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1725-1730PubMed Google Scholar, 32Larner A.C. Petricoin E.F.

We have previously reported the requisite role of IL-4-activated STAT6 in negative regulation of IFNγ-stimulated, STAT1-dependent transcription in macrophages (35Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29202-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These studies also demonstrated that the cis-acting sequences necessary for both IFNγ-stimulated transcription and IL-4-mediated suppression are identical (26Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5474-5482PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29202-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 36Deng W. Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2130-2136PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, IL-4 did not inhibit any aspect of IFNγ-driven STAT1 activation in these experiments (26Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5474-5482PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29202-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These findings suggested three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses. First, STAT6, which can bind to IFNγ-responsive GAS motifs without transactivation, could compete with STAT1 for site occupancy thereby preventing transcription. Second, STAT6 could compete with STAT1 for limiting quantities of a transcriptional coactivator such as CBP or p300. Finally, STAT6, through binding to IL-4-responsive sequence elements, might induce an inhibitory gene product. In the present report we have evaluated these three scenarios by examining the ability of wild type and mutated forms of STAT6 to reconstitute IL-4-induced transcription and IL-4-dependent suppression of IFNγ/STAT1- and/or TNFα/NF-κB-reporter gene expression in a STAT6-deficient cell line. The results of these studies support the following conclusions. 1) STAT6 mediates suppression of IFNγ/STAT1- and TNFα/NF-κB-dependent transcription via distinct molecular mechanisms. Both mechanisms of suppression depend upon the transactivation domain of STAT6 suggesting the importance of interaction with transcriptional coactivators or corepressors. 2) Suppression of NF-κB-dependent transcription is restored by overexpression of the coactivator CBP supporting the possibility that this mechanism involves sequestration of this important protein. In contrast IL-4-mediated suppression of IFNγ/STAT1-stimulated transcription was insensitive to overexpression of CBP. 3) A mutation in the DNA-binding domain of STAT6 selectively influenced STAT6 DNA binding preference leading to a blockade in IL-4-driven transcription. The ability of STAT6 to suppress NF-κB-mediated transcription was also lost, but IFNγ/STAT1-stimulated transcription remained STAT6-sensitive. Thus different suppressive mechanisms appear to be influenced by the nature of the DNA-binding site (i.e. N3versus N4). Furthermore, these findings along with the failure of puromycin to block STAT6-dependent suppressive activities suggest strongly that suppression is not a result of IL-4-stimulated repressor gene expression.Our initial studies of the inhibitory effect of IL-4 on IFNγ-inducible gene expression led to the hypothesis that STAT6 suppresses STAT1-dependent transcription by competing with STAT1 for occupancy of a common DNA-binding site (26Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5474-5482PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report demonstrated a requirement for the transactivation domain of STAT6 in suppressing IFNγ-driven transcription from the IRF-1 promoter even though the wild type and TAD deletion forms of STAT6 exhibited equivalent affinity for the N3 GAS motif (42Goenka S. Youn J. Dzurek L.M. Schindler U., Yu- Lee L.Y. Boothby M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4663-4672PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that the inhibition is not due to blocking of STAT1 occupancy of the IRF-1 GAS by transcriptionally inactive STAT6. The behavior of the TAD deletion is confirmed here and extended to include suppression of TNFα/NF-κB-driven transcription as well.The anti-inflammatory activity of IL-4 has also been shown to target NF-κB-dependent gene expression (33Donnelly R.P. Crofford L.J. Freeman S.L. Buras J. Remmers E. Wilder R.L. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5603-5612PubMed Google Scholar, 37Bennett B.L. Cruz R. Lacson R.G. Manning A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10212-10219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 51Takeshita S. Gage J.R. Kishimoto T. Vredevoe D.L. Martinez-Maza O. J.

In several cases this has been reported to involve either the inhibition of κB-specific DNA binding activity or competition between STAT6 and NF-κB for a shared or overlapping binding site. In addition, IL-4 has been shown to inhibit TNF-dependent NF-κB activation by down-regulation of TNF receptors (54Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33333-33341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We did not, however, observe inhibition of NF-κB activation or DNA binding activity by IL-4. Furthermore, since our NF-κB-responsive promoter contains no sites for STAT6 binding, the idea of competition for site occupancy can be essentially ruled out. The present results suggest a novel alternative route for the antagonistic effect of IL-4 on NF-κB-dependent transcription; IL-4-activated STAT6 and NF-κB may compete for a limited supply of CBP thus providing a mechanistic explanation for the ability of IL-4 to suppress NF-κB-dependent transcription without affecting its DNA binding activity. The concept of competition between activated transcription factors for interaction with limited availability transcriptional coactivators as a mechanism of selective gene regulation has received appreciable attention in the last several years (38Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29291-29294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that STAT1-dependent transcription requires both CBP and p/CIP, a member of the p160 coactivator family (56Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Additionally, CBP and p/CIP have been shown to associate with other cofactors (57Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 58Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that STAT6 may sequester CBP and/or other members of this coactivator family. In this regard, STAT6 TAD has been shown to interact with CBP, and CBP functions as a coactivator for STAT6, STAT1, and NF-κB (39Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.M. Rose D.W.

A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The ability to overcome STAT6-mediated suppression of TNFα/NF-κB by overexpressing CBP provides compelling support for this hypothesis. A recent report has shown that prolactin-activated STAT5b inhibits NF-κB dependent transcription by competing for CBP (61Luo G. Yu-Lee L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). It is intriguing, however, that, in agreement with the recent study of Goenka et al. (42Goenka S. Youn J. Dzurek L.M. Schindler U., Yu- Lee L.Y. Boothby M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4663-4672PubMed Google Scholar), overexpression of CBP does not prevent the suppression of IFNγ/STAT1-driven gene expression. This suggests, as mentioned above, that STAT6 TAD might interact with other coactivator or corepressor proteins providing the potential for distinct functional outcomes.Evaluation of the importance of DNA binding activity in IL-4/STAT6-dependent inhibitory function can also provide insight into mechanism. The study by Goenka et al. (42Goenka S. Youn J. Dzurek L.M. Schindler U., Yu- Lee L.Y. Boothby M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4663-4672PubMed Google Scholar) examined several different DNA-binding domain mutations and reported that suppressive activity was lost in each. Because both the TAD and DNA binding activity appeared to be required for suppression, these authors proposed the hypothesis that IL-4 suppresses gene expression via the STAT6-mediated induction of a new gene product with repressor activity. In this prior study, however, the functional characteristics of the DNA-binding mutants were not fully evaluated. Indeed, one of the mutations used was in the SH2 domain of STAT6 that had been shown previously to compromise completely the ability of the resulting protein to respond to IL-4 stimulation (25Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Our own experience with a 3-amino acid mutation in the DNA-binding domain at residues 411–413 showed the resulting protein product to be inactive as it was neither phosphorylated on tyrosine nor translocated to the nucleus following treatment of the cells with IL-4 (data not shown). Thus the loss of suppressive activity in this mutation was relatively uninformative regarding the DNA binding activity of STAT6 as a contributing feature of suppressive function.The mutation in residue 415 from His to Ala was, however, particularly informative. While the protein was responsive to IL-4 and translocated to the nucleus following stimulation, its DNA binding activity was selectively altered such that affinity for the N4 IL-4-responsive motif was markedly reduced without loss of apparent binding affinity for the IFNγ-responsive, N3 sites (Fig. 3). This mutant was predictably unable to support IL-4-stimulated gene transcription but retained nearly full suppressive activity on IFNγ/STAT1-dependent reporters, suggesting strongly that induction of a repressor gene is not involved. Whereas the possibility of a STAT6-inducible inhibitory gene product cannot be completely ruled out, several additional lines of evidence further support that STAT6-mediated inhibition of the STAT1-driven transcription is not dependent on a newly expressed gene product. First, the inhibition occurs in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin (Fig. 7). We did not use cycloheximide since this inhibitor has been shown to induce multiple pharmacological effects unrelated to inhibition of protein synthesis (62Edwards D.R. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2415-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 63Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4769-4775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Second, time course studies have shown that IL-4-induced, STAT6-mediated inhibition occurs within 2 h after stimulation in HEK 293 cells as well as macrophages (data not shown) (35Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29202-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Finally, t"

In this way NAC prevents inappropriate interactions with other factors.

All NAC preparations to date consist of two copurifying polypeptides. Here we rigorously show that these two polypeptides, termed α- and βNAC, form a very stable complex in vivo and in vitroand that a functional complex can be reconstituted from the individual subunits. A dissection of the contributions of the individual subunits to NACs function revealed that both subunits are in direct contact with nascent polypeptide chains on the ribosome and that both contribute to the prevention of inappropriate interactions.

However, βNAC alone directly binds to the ribosome and is sufficient to prevent ribosome binding to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. nascent polypeptide-associated complex dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) EDTA- and KOAc-stripped rough microsomes endoplasmic reticulum firefly luciferase fluorescein isothiocyanate glutathione S-transferase animo-terminal histidine-tagged version of βNAC ribosome-binding buffer recombinant reconstituted NAC ribosome nascent chain complex signal recognition particle 4-(trifluoromethyldiazirino)benzoic acid dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin recombinant reconstituted NAC complex of α- and βNAC muscle-specific isoform of αNAC Nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC)1 is a very abundant cytosolic protein, which is involved in cotranslational targeting of polypeptides to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The intracellular NAC concentration varies only slightly in different tissues, ranging from 3 to 10 μm (1Möller I. Beatrix B. Kreibich G. Sakai H. Lauring B. Wiedmann M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). NAC is highly conserved among eukaryotes, but up to now no functional prokaryotic homolog has been described. The importance of NACs in vivofunction is emphasized by early embryonically lethal phenotypes of NAC mutants in mice and fruit flies (2Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. Transgenic Res. 1995; 4: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Markesich D.C. Gajewski K.M. Nazimiec M.E. Beckingham K. Development. 2000; 127: 559-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it was also shown that yeast NAC, although not essential for growth (4Reimann B. Bradsher J. Franke J. Hartmann E. Wiedmann M. Prehn S. Wiedmann B. Yeast. 1999; 15: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), is involved in the import of proteins into mitochondria (5George R. Beddoe T. Landl K. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2296-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 6Fünfschilling U. Rospert S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3289-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). NAC was originally identified as a ribosome-associated protein when we set out to probe the molecular environment of growing polypeptides on the ribosome using a photo-cross-linking approach (7Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). With this technique we were able to show that NAC can interact with regions of nascent chains as close as 17 amino acids to the peptidyl transferase center. Additionally, it was shown by protease protection that NAC functions as a dissociable wall of a ribosomal tunnel through which the growing polypeptide emerges (8Wang S. Sakai H. Wiedmann M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cycles of binding and releasing NAC expose the polypeptide to the cytosol in “quantal units” rather than amino acid by amino acid. We have proposed that exposing the polypeptide chain in functional units contributes to fidelity in cotranslational processes such as targeting and folding (9Lauring B. Wang S. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann B. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Depleting NAC from translating ribosomes led to at least two inappropriate interactions. First, the signal recognition particle (SRP), which interacts with signal peptides of nascent chains on ribosomes during targeting to the ER membrane, could be cross-linked to nascent chains lacking signal peptides (7Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Second, in the absence of NAC ribosomes translating non-secretory polypeptides inappropriately interacted with translocation sites on ER membranes and the signal-less chains were even translocated, although with low efficiency. Adding back purified NAC to the system restored the fidelity of cotranslational ribosome binding and translocation of only secretory polypeptides (10Lauring B. Sakai H. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5411-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently the function of NAC in ribosome targeting to the ER was questioned (11Raden D. Gilmore R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,12Neuhof A. Rolls M.M. Jungnickel B. Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in studies that used subphysiological concentrations of NAC. Although we were able to reproduce these results, we found that, when NAC was restored to physiological levels, our original observations were confirmed (1Möller I. Beatrix B. Kreibich G. Sakai H. Lauring B. Wiedmann M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that NAC normally prevents inappropriate interactions with nascent polypeptides and is thereby involved in transferring growing nascent chains to the appropriate cotranslationally acting factors. As a first step toward understanding how NAC might transfer control of the nascent chain to the proper factor, we asked whether specific functions could be assigned to each of the two polypeptides, which were always found in NAC preparations purified from bovine brain, and whether these two proteins are always found together as a complex. Here we report by using various techniques that highly purified NAC, as well as NAC in crude extracts, is a very stable complex composed of α and β subunits. Human α- and βNAC were separately expressed in Escherichia coli and used to characterize the functions of the individual subunits and the reconstituted complex. Each subunit alone is in contact with the nascent chain on the ribosome. βNAC, but not αNAC, binds to ribosomes and prevents inappropriate ribosome binding to ER membranes. In contrast, prevention of cross-linking of SRP to signal-less nascent chains requires the complete NAC complex. Although αNAC alone is incapable of binding to ribosomes, it may contribute to NAC interaction with the ribosome or other cytosolic factors by virtue of its ability to bind tightly to nucleic acids, including those present in ribosomes and SRP. Purified NAC (6 μg in 50 μl) was diluted two times with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, and dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP, stock solution 10 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to 0.2 mg/ml and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. The cross-linker was quenched with 200 mm glycine. Proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to SDS-PAGE in the first dimension without DTT. The whole lane was cut out and incubated in 100 mm DTT for 10 min at room temperature and then processed for the second dimension SDS-PAGE with DTT (13Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Herz J. Otto A. Kraft R. Wiedmann M. Knespel S. Dobberstein B. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2283-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Crude bovine brain cytosol (100,000 × g supernatant in 20 mmHepes/KOH pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT) was fractionated on a Superose 12HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. As standards we used BSA (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). MC3T3-E1 cells (clonal osteogenic cell line, (14Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar)) were grown on glass coverslips to semi-confluency using minimal essential α medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The medium was exchanged against fresh medium with or without fetal calf serum, and cells were incubated for another 6 or 24 h. Immunohistochemistry was done following standard protocols. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C followed by an incubation with 50 mmNH4Cl in phosphate-buffered saline (8 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mmNaH2PO4, 70 mm NaCl) for 10 min at room temperature to quench residual paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized and blocked using 0.3% Triton X-100, 2% goat normal serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Affinity-purified antibodies raised against carboxyl-terminal peptides of α- and βNAC (7Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) were used. The secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit) conjugated to FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) was used as recommended by the manufacturer. The genes coding for human α- and βNAC were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) resulting in a fusion of the nacgenes to the glutathione S-transferase (gst) gene. The fusion genes were separately expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3), and expression products were purified using glutathione-agarose according to the manufacturer's manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-αNAC was cleaved with thrombin, and the GST moiety was removed on a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) run with a gradient of 0.15 to 1.0 m KCl in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. αNAC eluted at 490 mmsalt. GST-βNAC was eluted from the glutathione-agarose with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. Prior to thrombin cleavage Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.5% to prevent precipitation of βNAC. After thrombin cleavage, the GST moiety was removed on a DEAE-Sepharose column run with a gradient of 0.15 to 1.0m KCl in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100. βNAC eluted at ≥700 mm salt. To concentrate βNAC and remove the detergent, the eluted protein was pooled, diluted to 150 mm salt, and loaded immediately on a second DEAE column (200-μl resin volume). The column was washed with 13 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, and the protein was eluted in one step using 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2m KCl. To confirm removal of the detergent (which would interfere with the integrity of microsomal membranes), full-length preprolactin was translated in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of microsomal membranes, SRP, and the purified recombinant proteins. Successful translocation of preprolactin was confirmed by the protease protection assay (Ref. 15Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, data not shown). To reconstitute complex from the recombinant subunits, thrombin-cleaved GST fusion proteins were mixed and denatured by addition of 8m urea and incubation at room temperature for 1 h. Protease inhibitor (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to 1 mm, and refolding was induced by stepwise dialysis against buffers (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KOAc) containing successively lower concentrations of urea (4, 1, then 0m). Any precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 15 min, SS-34 rotor, Sorval, +4 °C). To remove GST, thrombin, and other copurifying proteins, the supernatant was loaded on a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a gradient over 0.15 to 1.0 m KCl (in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). On the following two columns excess, uncomplexed αNAC was removed. Mono Q fractions over 400–470 mm KCl were combined, diluted to 150 mm salt, and applied to a Green A Matrex column (Amicon), which was run with a gradient of 0.15 to 2.0m KCl (in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). Fractions over 930–1300 mm salt were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl and then applied to a (native) DNA-cellulose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; same buffers as for Mono Q) from which the complex eluted at 490 mm salt. Because the cleavage of GST-βNAC resulted only in limited yields of βNAC, the gene for βNAC was also cloned into pET-28a (Novagen) resulting in an amino-terminal histidine-tagged version of βNAC (6HisxβNAC). 6HisxβNAC was expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) and purified under denaturing conditions (presence of 6m urea in all buffers) following the manufacturer's manual (Novagen). 6HisxβNAC was refolded, and detergent was removed as described above. Following the same procedure as described for the GST fusion proteins, 6HisxβNAC could be reconstituted into a complex with αNAC, which was purified according to the same protocol as described above. In vitro transcription and translation of truncated mRNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysates was done as described previously (16Gilmore R. Collins P. Johnson J. Kellaris K. Rapiejko P. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Truncated mRNAs were translated for 20 min at 26 °C. After translation, 9 volumes of dilution buffer (40 mm Hepes, 0.5 m KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.5) was added, and RNCs (ribosome nascent chain complexes) were recovered by centrifugation (100,000 rpm, 40 min, 4 °C, TLA-100.4 rotor, Beckman) through a 1.5-ml high salt-containing sucrose cushion (0.5m sucrose in dilution buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (18Erickson A.H. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar)) and 0.8 unit/μl RNasin (Promega)). RNCs were resuspended in ribosome binding buffer (RBB; 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, supplemented with protease inhibitors and 0.8 unit/μl RNasin) using 0.5 volume of the buffer unit volume of the original translation mixture. Insoluble material was then removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. Recovery of the nascent chain complexes was typically 50–75%. These complexes were free of NAC as assessed by Western blotting (not shown) or by a site-specific photo-cross-linking approach. Photo-cross-linking, in which 4-(trifluoromethyldiazirino)benzoic acid (TDBA)-modified lys-tRNA was added to a reticulocyte lysate translation system, was done according to a previous study (19Görlich D. Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Rapoport T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Incubation of DNA (0.4 μg of pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) digested withBanI) or RNA samples (1 μg of complete yeast tRNA (Boehringer), 2 μg of bovine ribosomal RNA (Sigma)) in band shift buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 5% glycerin) with increasing amounts of αNAC (0.4–3.0 μm) was performed in a total volume of 20 μl and at a final salt concentration of 80 mm K+. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 23 °C and separated on agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Gels were prepared with and run in 0.5 × TAE buffer (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Dog pancreas rough microsomes were prepared as described (21Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Rough microsomes (in 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were adjusted to high salt by addition of 0.5 volume of 1.5 m KOAc, 15 mmMg(OAc)2 and incubated for 20 min on ice. Membranes were sedimented through a 25-ml high salt sucrose cushion (0.5 msucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, 32,000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C, Ti-45 rotor, Beckman). Ribosomes were pelleted from the supernatant through 3 ml of the same high salt sucrose cushion (65,000 rpm, 75 min, 4 °C, Ti-70 rotor, Beckman) and resuspended in RBB (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT). To separate ribosomal subunits, ribosomes were incubated with 2 mm puromycin for 10 min at 37 °C followed by addition of KOAc to a final concentration of 0.5 m. Ribosomes (200A 260 units in 2 ml) were loaded on top of 7–20% high salt sucrose gradients (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5 m KOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 7–20% sucrose, 38 ml total) and spun at 27,000 rpm for 7 h at 20 °C in a SW-28 rotor (Beckman). Gradients were unloaded in 1-ml fractions, and fractions containing ribosomal subunits were pooled as judged by theA 260 profile of each gradient (22Adelman M.R. Blobel G. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To remove salt and concentrate the ribosomal subunits, samples were diluted with 1 volume of RBB and sedimented (100,000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C, TLA-100.4 rotor, Beckman). Ribosomal pellets were resuspended in RBB and homogenized, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. 80 S ribosomes or 60 S ribosomal subunits were incubated with recombinant NAC or its individual subunits (in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mmMg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT, 0.8 unit/μl RNasin, and protease inhibitors, total volume of 20 μl) for 2 min at 26 °C and 5 min on ice. Ribosomes were then sedimented through a low salt sucrose cushion (750 μl of 0.5 m sucrose in RBB, 3 h, 45,000 rpm, 4 °C, SW 55 Ti rotor, Beckman). Tubes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut into three fractions (Top, Middle, Bottom). A pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1% SDS. The NAC content of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In case of βNAC, all buffers and gradient solutions had to be supplemented with detergent (0.2% Triton X-100) and an inert protein (aprotinin, 20 μg/ml) to prevent aggregation of unbound βNAC. Centrifugation tubes were precoated with aprotinin to prevent unspecific binding of βNAC to the Ultraclear centrifugation tubes (Beckman). Truncated RNCs in 0.5 volume of RBB (see above) were incubated with NAC or its individual subunits for 2 min at 26 °C and 5 min on ice prior to addition of 0.2 eq/μl EDTA/KOAc stripped rough microsomes (EKRM) (21Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). After 2 min at 26 °C and 5 min on ice, membranes and bound ribosomes were floated as described (23Möller I. Jung M. Beatrix B. Levy R. Kreibich G. Zimmermann R. Wiedmann M. Lauring B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13425-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Purified NAC from bovine brain obtained after several chromatography steps consists of two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 33 and 22 kDa (7Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To determine whether both polypeptides are required for NAC function we first asked whether they form a stable complex. Purified NAC migrated as a single moiety under non-denaturing conditions on PAGE (Fig.1 A, lane 1). When the band was excised and subjected to SDS-PAGE (under denaturing conditions) α- and βNAC were resolved as two bands (Fig.1 a, lane 2). Scanning and integrating the bands stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue in lane 2 suggested a 1:1 stoichiometry. Other independent methods also support the hypothesis that NAC forms a heterodimeric complex of a 1:1 stoichiometry. Using the bi-functional, thiol-cleavable cross-linking reagent DSP (dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), α- and βNAC were shown to form a complex, which was resolved by treatment with DTT (Fig. 1 B). No homo-oligomers were detected with this method. Additionally, we subjected purified NAC to analysis by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 C). Three peaks were obtained that correspond to the predicted molecular masses of αNAC (23,492 Da), βNAC (17,352 Da), and the heterodimeric complex (40,864 Da), demonstrating that the differences in the calculated and apparent molecular masses deduced by SDS-PAGE are not the result of modifications but of an unusual running behavior in SDS-PAGE. The detection of a peak for the intact complex is an indication for a very stable complex. Sizing chromatography reveals that in crude bovine brain extracts the NAC subunits are also in a complex (Fig. 1 D). Note that no single subunits are detected in the appropriate fractions where the single subunits would be expected. NAC was also subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting either without or after treating NAC samples with bifunctional cross-linkers. These data (not shown) also indicate that α- and βNAC form a complex in crude cytosol. NAC was originally purified from bovine brain cytosol and was associated with cytosolic ribosomes, suggesting that NAC is a cytosolic protein. Using a polyclonal anti-GST-αNAC serum (rather than affinity-purified antibodies) for immunofluorescence, it was recently claimed that αNAC is localized in the nucleus after serum starvation of MC3T3-E1 cells, a clonal osteogenic cell line (24Yotov W.V. Moreau A. St-Arnaud R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy using affinity-purified anti-α- and anti-βNAC peptide-specific antibodies to determine the localization of NAC in intact cells. Different cell lines (including COS-, HeLa-, Hep-G2, and HL60 cells) were tested for NAC localization by immunostaining. In all of these cases the vast majority of NAC was found in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Staining of MC3T3-E1 cells also suggested a cytosolic localization for both subunits regardless of whether the cells had been starved or not (Fig. 2). Cells were grown to semi-confluency. In parallel samples, cells were either arrested at the G0/G1 border by serum deprivation for 24 h (Fig. 2, b and d) or allowed to continue to grow after exchange of the medium (Fig. 2, a andc). The vast majority of αNAC (Fig. 2, a andb) as well as βNAC (Fig. 2, c and d) was clearly localized in the cytoplasm. Control staining without a first antibody showed a complete absence of signal (Fig.2 e). The same result was obtained after starving the cells for only 6 h (data not shown). The very high intracellular concentration of NAC (3–10 μm (1Möller I. Beatrix B. Kreibich G. Sakai H. Lauring B. Wiedmann M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)) naturally results in such an intense staining of the cells that we cannot exclude that a minor fraction of NAC might enter the nucleus to perform a different function. However, our results clearly demonstrate that NAC is not depleted from the cytosol in a cell cycle-dependent manner but is one of the most abundant cytosolic proteins. To define the role of NAC subunits in the described biological functions, the two were separately expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (Fig.3, lanes 3 and 4). A 70-kDa protein often copurified during the initial steps with GST-αNAC, which was identified as DnaK (the Hsp70 homolog of E. coli) by Western blotting. Additionally, βNAC was expressed and purified as a his-tagged protein (Fig. 3, lane 4), because much higher yields could be achieved using this construct. Both βNAC variants (with or without his-tag) could be reconstituted into a functional α/β complex (see below). Recombinant reconstituted NAC (recNAC) could be purified to concentrations of 10–15 μm(Fig. 3, lane 2), which is 3- to 4-fold more concentrated than the highest achievable concentration of NAC purified from bovine brain (Fig. 3, lane 1). NACs contact to a nascent chain on the ribosome can be shown in a cross-linking approach where a photoactivatable cross-linker is incorporated instead of lysine into the nascent chain. For the assay documented in Fig. 4 RNCs (ribosome nascent chain complexes) containing the amino-terminal 77 amino acids of peroxisomal firefly luciferase (77aaffLuc), which lacks an ER signal sequence, were prepared in a reticulocyte lysate translation system, supplemented with TDBA-modified lys-tRNA and [35S]methionine. RNCs were high salt-extracted and incubated with recombinant αNAC, his-tagged βNAC, recNAC, or NAC purified from bovine brain. After irradiation, cross-linking products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. The mass of the cross-linked protein can be estimated by deducting the mass of the nascent chain from that of the cross-linked product. In the absence of any added factors, no prominent cross-link appeared after irradiation (Fig. 4, lane 2). Both subunits, if added separately (Fig.4, lanes 3 and 4), as well as in the reconstituted complex (Fig. 4, lane 5), are in close contact with the nascent chain, because they give rise to strong cross-links to the nascent chain. The cross-links are comparable in strength to those obtained with NAC purified from bovine brain (Fig. 4, lane 6), indicating that with regard to this function recNAC is as active as bovine NAC. No cross-links to the NAC subunits were detected if the nascent chains were released from the ribosome by puromycin treatment prior to irradiation (data not shown). Although αNAC is clearly in close proximity to the nascent chain (a prerequisite for obtaining a cross-linking product with this method), its interaction with the RNC seems to be weaker than that of βNAC. If the RNCs are sedimented through a low salt-containing (150 mm KOAc) sucrose cushion prior to irradiation, the cross-link to αNAC is hardly detectable, whereas the cross-link to βNAC remains unchanged (data not shown). This result implies that βNAC can bind to RNCs (see below) and αNAC, in the absence of the β subunit, is in rather loose contact with the nascent chain (see below). NAC acts at the ribosome where it is in close vicinity not only to various cytosolic and ribosomal proteins but also to several different RNA molecules,e.g. ribosomal RNA, mRNA, tRNA, and 7SL RNA of the ribonucleoprotein complex SRP. Therefore, we were interested in the question whether αNAC, which does not bind to non-translating ribosomes (see below), can bind to nucleic acids. Interestingly, it had been recently reported that αNAC binds to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. A consensus sequence for binding of αNAC to DNA was published (5′-(G/C)(G/C)A(G/C)A(G/C)ANNNG-3′) (25Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We confirmed binding of αNAC to oligonucleotides containing this motif; however, we also observed binding to oligonucleotides where this motif was mutated (data not shown). To further characterize the binding of αNAC to nucleic acids, we tested binding to DNA, rRNA, tRNA, and 7SL RNA. DNA binding was tested using the plasmid pBluescript SK+, which was cleaved withBanI, resulting in four easily distinguishable fragments (244, 386, 1097, and 1231 bp). Only one contains the so-called “NAC motif” (1097 bp). The DNA fragments were incubated with increasing amounts of αNAC and separated on agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. All four DNA fragments exhibit a slower mobility in the gel, indicating that αNAC bound to them regardless of whether they contained the NAC motif or not (Fig.5 a). Furthermore, the more αNAC is added, the stronger the retardation effect becomes, indicating that more than one αNAC molecule binds to each of the DNA fragments. αNAC binding is not restricted to DNA molecules. Incubation of ribosomal RNA from bovine liver (Fig. 5 b) or complete tRNA from yeast (Fig. 5 c) with rising amounts of αNAC also resulted in a complete shift of the RNA band(s). αNAC also bound to the 7SL RNA in an almost 1:1 stoichiometry (data not shown). In summary, αNAC binds to all nucleic acids we have tested. Clearly, this affinity is not restricted to DNA molecules and is not dependent on a specific sequence motif. The ability of αNAC to bind to RNA and DNA molecules might contribute to the overall binding of the NAC complex to ribosomes or may even underlie its ability to compete with SRP for access to nascent chains (see below). If this capacity contributes to the overall binding of the complex to translating ribosomes, RNA molecules should compete for the interaction of αNAC with the nascent chain.

Because IGFBP-5 has been shown to regulate IGF-I actions, understanding the chemical identity and regulation of this protease is important for understanding how IGF-I stimulates anabolic functions. The protease was purified from human fibroblast-conditioned medium by hydrophobic interaction, lectin affinity, and heparin Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An 88-kDa band was excised and digested with lysyl-endopeptidase. Sequencing of the high pressure liquid chromatography-purified peptides yielded the complement components C1r and C1s. To confirm that C1r/C1s accounted for the proteolytic activity in the medium, immunoaffinity chromatography was performed. Most of the protease activity adhered to the column, and the eluant was fully active in cleaving IGFBP-5. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining showed two bands, and IGFBP-5 zymography showed a single 88-kDa band. Amino acid sequencing confirmed that the 88-kDa band contained only C1r and C1s. C1r in the fibroblast medium underwent autoactivation, and the activated form cleaved C1s. C1s purified from the conditioned medium cleaved C4, a naturally occurring substrate. The purified protease cleaved IGFBP-5 but had no activity against IGFBP-1 through -4. C1 inhibitor, a protein known to inhibit activated C1s, was shown to inhibit the cleavage of IGFBP-5 by the protease in the conditioned medium. In summary, human fibroblasts secrete C1r and C1s that actively cleave IGFBP-5. The findings define a mechanism for cleaving IGFBP-5 in the culture medium, thus allowing release of IGF-I to cell surface receptors.

LeRoith D. Insulin-like Growth Factors: Molecular and Cellular Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 49-85Google Scholar). The mitogenic potential of IGF-I is controlled by a family of high affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) that are ubiquitously present in interstitial fluids (2Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 49-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The concentrations of IGFBPs and their affinity constants are such that at equilibrium most of the IGF-I is bound (3Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocrine. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factors that disrupt this binding, such as proteolysis, result in the release of IGF-I to receptors (4Binoux M. Lalou C. Lassarre C. Segovia B.

Both cultured human fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells secrete an IGFBP-5 protease that is specific for IGFBP-5 and cleaves it into a 22-kDa fragment, which has more than 1000-fold reduction in its affinity for IGF-I (7Nam T.J. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5530-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Studies utilizing a protease-resistant IGFBP-5 mutant have shown that high concentrations of the mutant IGFBP-5 (at least a 5-fold molar excess over IGF-I) completely inhibited IGF-I-mediated receptor activation (9Imai Y. Busby W.H. Clark J.B. Horvitz G. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, if a 1:1 molar ratio of native IGFBP-5 to IGF-I is added to extracellular matrix, IGFBP-5 can act to potentiate the mitogenic effect of IGF-I (10Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Therefore, the factors that control proteolytic cleavage of IGFBP-5 represent an important mechanism for controlling the amount of IGF-I that is available to interact with receptors. Although some broad spectrum proteases, such as plasmin, thrombin, or matrix metalloproteases-2 and -9, have been shown to cleave several forms of IGFBPs, the identity of IGFBP protease activities that are specific for a single form of IGFBP has been difficult to determine (9Imai Y.

Recently, a partially purified fraction of fibroblast-conditioned medium containing the pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A protease was shown to specifically cleave IGFBP-4 (15Lawrence J.B. Qxuig C. Overgaard M.T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Harp L.G. Yates J.R. Conover C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3149-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). However a homogenous preparation of a protease that specifically cleaves IGFBP-5 has not been reported. For these reasons, we purified and characterized the IGFBP-5-specific protease that is present in fibroblast-conditioned medium. Human dermal fibroblasts (GM 10) were purchased from Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ). The cells were grown to confluency in 175-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Falcon Labware, Fairfield, NJ) in minimum essential media (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% bovine serum (Colorado Serum Co., Denver, CO). To collect conditioned medium, the monolayers were washed three times with PBS, and 150 ml of serum-free minimum essential medium was added per flask. The medium was collected after 48 h, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min to remove cellular debris, and then stored at −70 °C. Ammonium sulfate (Mallinckrodt, Baker, Paris, KY) was added to 12 liters of conditioned medium to 85% saturation, and the mixture was stored for 14 h at 4 °C, then centrifuged at 23,500 × g for 1 h. The pellet was extracted with 600 ml of 20 mm Tris, 4 mmCaCl2, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The extract was adjusted to 1.0 m ammonium sulfate, stirred for 2 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 23,500 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was applied to a 4.4 × 3.5 cm butyl-Sepharose column-4 (Fast Flow, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The flow-through material was discarded, and the column was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, then tested for proteolytic activity. The fractions that were eluted were tested for activity by incubating between 1 and 10 μl with 100 ng of IGFBP-5 for 14 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of 0.05 m Tris, 4 mmCaCl2, pH 7.2 (7Nam T.J. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The products of the reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with immunoblotting using a specific anti-IGFBP-5 antiserum, as described previously (16Camacho-Hubner C. Busby W.H. McCusker R.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluant, approximately 350 ml, was applied directly to a wheat germ-agarose column (1.6 × 5.0 cm; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.4m NaCl, pH 7.2. The fractions were eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. The fractions containing proteolytic activity were determined as described above, and then the fractions with the greatest amount of activity were pooled (approximately 100 ml of eluant) and diluted 1:1 with 20 mmTris, 4 mm CaCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 0.4 m NaCl, pH 7.2. This solution was applied to a concanavalin A-agarose column (Sigma; 1 × 9 cm) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 mα-methylmannopyranoside (Sigma), and the fractions were tested for activity as described previously. The pool of active fractions was diluted to 30 mm NaCl, 42 mmα-d-mannopyranoside, and applied to a 2.5 × 6 cm heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, 4 mmCaCl2, 30 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. The column was eluted with the same buffer containing either 0.5 or 1.0 mNaCl, and the fractions were tested for protease activity. Antiserum to C1r and C1s was prepared using synthetic peptides that contained the following sequences: C1r (CLYPKEHEAQSNASLDVFLGHTNVEE) and C1s (CVEGNREPTMYVGSTSVQTSRLAKS). The peptides (6.1 mg of C1r and 8.8 mg of C1s) were each conjugated to 4 mg of maleimide-activated KLH (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Each peptide was linked with KLH in 1.4 ml of 0.83m Na2H2PO4, pH 7.2, containing 0.9 m NaCl, 0.35 m EDTA. Following dialysis in the same buffer without EDTA, the mixture was lyophilized. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with 1 mg of linked KLH peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant. The rabbits were injected with 0.5 mg of KLH peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at monthly intervals. To prepare an affinity column, 6 ml of C1r and C1s antisera were each diluted to 12 ml with 20 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.0, and each solution was applied to a protein G-Sepharose-4 (Fast-flow, 1.0 × 7.0 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) affinity column. The IgG was eluted with 0.1m glycine HCl, pH 2.5, and immediately neutralized with 1.0m Tris to pH 7.2. The purity of the IgG was 95–99% based on SDS-PAGE with silver staining. 15.4 mg of the anti-C1r and 15.4 mg of anti-C1s IgG were mixed and dialyzed against 0.02 msodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl, then oxidized for 1 h with 0.01 m NaIO4. Oxidation was terminated with glycerol, and the mixture was then dialyzed against 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 0.10 m NaCl. The solution was mixed with Affi-Prep Hz support (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for 24 h at 4 °C, then washed. Approximately 10 ml of the pool of active fractions that had been eluted from heparin-Sepharose was diluted to 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2 and applied to the anti-C1r/C1s affinity column (1.5 × 5.5 cm) at 3 ml/h. The active fractions were eluted in that buffer containing 1.0m NaCl. The partially purified material (4–5 ml) was concentrated ∼50-fold on an Ultrafree 0.5-ml centrifugal filter (Biomax-10K NMWL, Millipore, Bedford, MA) prior to SDS-PAGE. Both material that had been purified through the heparin-Sepharose step and material that had been immunoaffinity-purified were sequenced. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, 9% gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, R-250 (Sigma) then destained for 2 h, and bands corresponding to molecular mass estimates of 88, 180, 280, and > 300 kDa were excised. These gel slices were washed three times in 450 μl of 50% acetonitrile/0.2 m Tris, pH 9.0. The gel pieces were incubated in 200 μl of 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.2, containing 0.4 μg of lysyl-endopeptidase (Wako Bioproducts, Richmond, VA) for 14 h at 37 °C, and then they were sonicated for 30 min at room temperature. An additional 0.2 μg of lysyl-endopeptidase was added, and the incubation was continued for 5 h at 37 °C. The peptides were extracted by adding 100 μl of 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.0, followed by 30 min of sonication. This was repeated using 400 μl of buffer then followed by two additional extractions with 400 μl of 60% acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. All four extracts were pooled and diluted to 6% acetonitrile with 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid. The pH was adjusted to 3.0, and the solution was applied to a reverse-phase HPLC C18 (2 mm × 15 cm) column (VYDAC, Hesperia, CA). The column was eluted with 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid and a linear acetonitrile gradient (10–60%) over 75 min. Selected peptides were repurified using the same solvents except that the gradient was extended to 125 min. Multiple internal peptides that were obtained from each band were sequenced. Automated Edman degradation chemistry was used to determine the NH2-terminal sequence for the unknown peptides (17Hunkapiller M.W. Hewick R.M. Dreyer R.J. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The following systems were employed for these analyses: I. Applied Biosystems model 494 protein sequencer, model 140C microgradient system, and model 785A absorbance detector. The PTH-derivatives were identified by reverse-phase HPLC analysis in an on-line fashion and utilized a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Brownlee 2.1-mm inner diameter PTH-C18 column. II. PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems model 492 cLC protein sequencer model 140D microgradient system and model 785A absorbance detector. The online reverse-phase HPLC analysis of the PTH-derivatives was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Brownlee 0.8-mm inner diameter PTH-C18 column. Purified protein fractions or concentrated conditioned media samples were loaded onto 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed as described previously (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar). Appropriate protein markers were run in a parallel lane to determine molecular weight. For some analyses, the gel was fixed with 5% acetic acid, 10% ethanol, and analyzed by silver staining. For other analyses, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, as described previously (19Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of C1r or C1s antiserum in 2.0 ml of PBS containing 1% BSA, pH 7.0, for 14 h. After extensive washing in PBS, they were incubated for 3 h, diluted 1:1500 with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline-phosphatase in TBS with 0.1% BSA, and then the immune complexes were detected as described previously (16Camacho-Hubner C. Busby W.H. McCusker R.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pure C1r (400 ng) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) or C1s (400 ng) (Enzyme Research, South Bend, IN) were run in parallel lanes to confirm that the antibodies recognized proteins of the correct molecular weight. For immunoblotting of C4, a 7.5% gel was used. The anti-C4 antiserum (Calbiochem) was used at a 1:500 dilution. For immunoblotting for IGFBP-1, -2, -3, and -4, the specific antisera utilized and the conditions used have been described previously (7Nam T.J. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Seven micrograms of IGFBP-5 was mixed with 4.0 ml of acrylamide gel solution (10% gel), and the gel was polymerized (5Fowlkes J. Enghild J.J. Suzukik N. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25742-25746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IGFBP-5 protease-containing fractions were concentrated 5–20× by centrifugation using Ultrafree 0.5-ml centrifugal filters. The filter was exposed to 10 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer, and this was pooled with the concentrate (20 μl) then electrophoresed at room temperature. The gel was washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by extensive washing in distilled water. The gel was incubated in 0.05 m Tris, 4 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, overnight at 37 °C to allow for proteolysis and for capillary transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (9Imai Y. Busby W.H. Clark J.B. Horvitz G. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The membrane was immunoblotted using a 1:1000 dilution of IGFBP-5 antiserum as described above. The electrophoretic mobility of the bands that were detected was compared with prestained molecular weight standards (Life Technologies). To determine if the purified C1r could undergo autoactivation, 500 ng of material was incubated in 0.02 ml of 0.025 m MES, 125 mmNaCl, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.2, for 15–90 min. The products of the reaction were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% gel) using reducing conditions, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, followed by immunoblotting for C1r and C1s. To determine the ability of the purified C1s to be cleaved by C1r, 400 ng of the highly purified protease was exposed to 800 ng of C1r in 30 μl of the buffer listed previously, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% gel) under reducing conditions, followed by immunoblotting for C1s. To determine if the purified IGFBP-5 protease had activity in cleaving C4, 180 or 540 ng of the highly purified protease was incubated with 600 ng of C4(Calbiochem) in 25 μl of 25 mm MES, 125 mmNaCl, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.2, for 18 h and the products analyzed SDS-PAGE (7% gel) with immunoblotting for C4. Duplicate tubes containing 200 or 500 ng of pure C1s (Enzyme Research) were also analyzed. To determine the ability of the purified IGFBP-5 protease to cleave IGFBP-5, between 3 and 50 ng of protein was incubated with 100 ng of IGFBP-5 in 60 μl of 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.2, with 4 mm CaCl2 for variable time periods up to 3.5 h at 37 °C. To determine the effects of protease inhibitors on the ability of IGFBP-5 protease in conditioned media to cleave IGFBP-5, 25 μl of fibroblast conditioned media was incubated with 100 ng of IGFBP-5 for 16 h at 37 °C in the buffer listed previously. The following inhibitors were analyzed, PB-145 (10−7m), a synthetic peptide with sequence similarity to anti-thrombin III (20Schastein C.S. Levine R.B. McLafferty S.A. Finn R.F. Bullock L.D. Bonner D. Lasky S.R. Mayden J.C. Glover G.I. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 1997: 17-26Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), heparin co-factor II (10−7m), antithrombin III (10−7m). In additional experiments, the ability of the purified protein to cleave other forms of IGFBPs was determined by incubating 50 ng of purified protease with 150 ng of pure IGFBP-1, -2, -3, and -4 as stated for IGFBP-5. The products of the reactions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel) followed by immunoblotting for each specific IGFBP. Silver stain analysis of the material purified through the heparin-Sepharose step showed a prominent 88-kDa band, a high molecular weight band that did not enter the gel, and two other bands with molecular mass estimates of 180 and 280 kDa (Fig.1 A). Minor bands were detected at 92 and 240 kDa. Amino acid sequence analysis of the 88-kDa band showed that it contained the C1r and C1s sequences. Eleven peptides that were sequenced had sequences corresponding to human C1r, and eight peptides had sequences corresponding to human C1s (Fig.2). Each of these peptides was distinct and was not a mixture of the two sequences. Likewise, single HPLC peaks yielded pure peptides that were either pure C1r or pure C1s, but, within a single digested band, peaks that contained either C1r or C1s were detected. When the faint band that was detected at 92 kDa was carefully excised from the gel and separated from the lower 88-kDa band, sequences corresponding to C1r only were obtained. The 180-kDa band gave the sequences of the α1 and α2 chains of collagen type VI. The 280-kDa band contained two peptides with sequences corresponding to tenascin-C, and the band that did not enter the gel contained multiple peptides with sequences encoding collagen type VI or thrombospondin-1. Both tenascin-C and thrombospondin-1 have been shown to bind to IGFBP-5 (21Parker A. Clarke J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13523-13529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Nam T.J. Busby W.H. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of the identical material with anti-C1r antiserum showed a prominent 88-kDa band that co-migrated with the intact C1r standard and a second band that had a molecular mass estimate of >200 kDa (Fig. 1 B). When analyzed following reduction, the major C1r band was detected that had a molecular mass estimate of 94 kDa, and less abundant bands were detected at 62 and 38 kDa (Fig. 1 B). These corresponded to size estimates of pure activated C1r. Immunoblotting for C1s showed prominent bands with molecular mass estimates of 88 and >200 kDa (non-reduced) and 86, 68, and 28 kDa (following reduction). IGFBP-5 zymography of this same material showed a prominent band of activity with an 88-kDa molecular mass estimate, and a less intense band was detected that had an estimated molecular mass of 190 kDa (Fig.2 C). Four independently run gels, followed by excision of the 88-kDa band and sequence analyses, showed only C1r and C1s, and no other proteins were present in this band. When IGFBP-5 protease activity was analyzed, 25 ng of this material (400 ng/ml) cleaved 100 ng of IGFBP-5 in 1.5 h (Fig. 2 D). There was a concentration-dependent increase in activity, and cleavage was detected using protease concentrations as low as 3.5 ng (60 ng/ml).Figure 2Sequences of peptides from C1r and C1s. The HPLC-purified peptides that are shown were sequenced. The sequences of contiguous peptides are underlined. The arrowdenotes the position of the cleavage site that is required for activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the heparin-Sepharose-purified material had several bands that were detected by silver staining, the material was further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. Silver stain analysis of the material that was eluted showed three detectable bands (Fig.3 A). Sequence analysis of the 88-kDa band confirmed the presence of C1r and C1s, and no other peptide sequences were detected. Sequence analysis of the band that did not enter the gel revealed thrombospondin-1. The 160-kDa band yielded rabbit IgG, suggesting that this band had been cleaved and eluted during immunoaffinity chromatography. Immunoblotting for C1s showed an intense 88-kDa band and faint bands of >200 kDa and 68 kDa. Following reduction, bands with estimated molecular masses of 92 and 70 and 30 kDa were detected (Fig. 3 B). Immunoblotting for C1r showed two bands at 88 and 92 kDa and a band with an estimated molecular mass of 180 kDa. Analysis of IGFBP-5 protease activity showed that the material was fully active and yielded the expected 22-kDa band. Approximately 2 ng of the material degraded 100 ng of IGFBP-5 (2 μg/ml) in 3.5 h (Fig. 3 C). This result establishes that the material purified by this procedure that cleaved IGFBP-5 into a 22-kDa fragment contained only C1r and C1s, and no other proteases could be identified in the 88-kDa band or any of the protein contaminant bands. C1r has been shown to cleave C1s, which is secreted as a zymogen, to generate its active form (23Ziccardi R.J. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1976; 116: 504-509PubMed Google Scholar, 24Arlaud G. Thielens N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 223: 61-83Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine if pure C1r could activate our purified C1s, activated C1r was incubated with our purified material, and then it was analyzed by immunoblotting after reduction for evidence of activation. Immunoblotting showed full activation of our purified C1s that was comparable to activation of a purified C1s standard (Fig.4 a). To exclude the possibility that all of the IGFBP-5 protease activity was due to C1r, activated C1r was incubated with IGFBP-5. A high concentration (e.g. 2–5 μg of C1r) was required to detect cleavage (Fig. 4 b). Furthermore, cleavage proceeded slowly, and the fragments that were obtained had estimated molecular masses of 24 and 26 kDa. In contrast, a much lower concentration of activated C1r (e.g. 400–800 ng) cleaved C1s into the 67- and 30-kDa forms (Fig. 4 b). To determine if C1r in the purified samples could further autoactivate, and if its autoactivation was associated with C1s activation, we incubated the heparin-Sepharose-purified material for 0.5, 1, and 2 h at 37 °C, then determined the degree of C1r and C1s activation by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.5, a time-dependent increase in activated C1r and C1s was detected. These findings suggest that C1r is functioning to activate C1s, which is cleaving IGFBP-5. To confirm that the purified protease could cleave C4, the known physiologic substrate for C1s, its capacity to cleave C4was compared with pure C1s. The purified protease had greater activity in cleaving C4 than did pure C1s (Fig.6). To determine the specificity of the protease for IGFBP-5, 50 ng of material purified through the immunoaffinity chromatography step was incubated with pure IGFBP-1, -2, -3, -4, or -5. As shown in Fig. 7, only IGFBP-5 was degraded by the purified protease. Because the IGFBP-5 proteolytic activity in crude fibroblast-conditioned medium is specific for IGFBP-5 (7Nam T.J. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), this finding further supports the conclusion that we have purified the protease that accounts for the IGFBP-5 proteolytic activity in fibroblast-conditioned medium.Figure 5Autoactivation of C1r and activation of C1s. To determine if the C1r in the purified protease faction could autoactivate and if its activation correlated with C1s activation, the heparin-Sepharose-purified material was incubated for 15 min, 45 min, and 90 min, and the same samples were analyzed for both C1r (lanes 1–4) and C1s (lanes 5–8) activation using reducing conditions. Lanes 1 and 5, no incubation; lanes 2 and 6, 15 min; lanes 3 and 7, 45 min; lanes 4 and 8, 90 min. The results show that C1r is autoactivated, and C1s is also activated over the same time course.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6Cleavage of C4.

The material that had been immunoaffinity purified (50 ng) was tested for its capacity to cleave other forms of IGFBPs, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each form of IGFBP (150 ng) was incubated with the protease for 16 h at 37 °C, and then each was analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antisera. The preparation and specificity of the antisera that were used to detect IGFBP-1 through -4 have been described previously (7Nam T.J. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). No fragments were detected except when IGFBP-5 was used as a substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further confirm that C1r and C1s accounted for IGFBP-5 proteases in fibroblast-conditioned medium, several serine protease inhibitors that had been shown to inhibit IGFBP-5 proteolysis to some extent were incubated with crude material that had only been purified through the first step, and their ability to inhibit IGFBP-5 cleavage was determined. As shown in Fig. 8, several of these inhibitors at least partially inhibited IGFBP-5 proteolysis. C1 inhibitor, the physiologic inhibitor of C1s activation (25Davies A.E. Amlak K.S. Zahedi K. Bissler J.J. Harrison R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 223: 97-119Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was the most potent inhibitor of the IGFBP-5 protease activity contained in the fibroblast-conditioned medium. The other inhibitors that had less of an effect on C1s activation (data not shown) also had less of an effect on IGFBP-5 proteolysis. We have reported previously that human fibroblasts secrete an IGFBP-5 protease that cleaves IGFBP-5 into predominantly a 22-kDa fragment, and this fragment has a low affinity for IGF-I (8Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5530-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This proteolytic activity is a serine protease and is specific for IGFBP-5 (7Nam T.J. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because IGFBP-5 is an important modulator of IGF-I bioactivity, the factors that regulate the activity of this protease have the potential to regulate the ability of IGFBP-5 to modulate IGF-I actions. For that reason, we were interested in determining the molecular identity of IGFBP-5 protease activity in fibroblast-conditioned medium. To that end, we purified a large quantity of IGFBP-5 protease from human fibroblast-conditioned medium and subjected it to amino acid sequence analysis. Sequence analysis yielded several peptides that encoded C1r and C1s. Because these proteins could not be separated, it is not possible to definitively determine which protease is actually cleaving IGFBP-5; however, C1s is known to have a much broader range of substrates (25Davies A.E. Amlak K.S. Zahedi K. Bissler J.J. Harrison R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 223: 97-119Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a very low concentration (60 ng/ml) of the C1r/C1s mixture cleaved IGFBP-5 rapidly. In contrast, IGFBP-5 cleavage by C1r required a much higher concentration, proceeded slowly, and yielded fragments that had size estimates that were different from those that were detected after cleavage by the purified IGFBP-5 protease. These results do not exclude the possibility that C1r may be cleaving IGFBP-5 to some extent in the medium, but they suggest that C1s accounts for the major portion of the IGFBP-5 protease activity. Because C1s is secreted at least in part as an inactive zymogen, the primary role of C1r may be to cleave and activate C1s, which subsequently cleaves IGFBP-5. This conclusion is also supported by the known specificity of both enzymes for specific recognition sequences (25Davies A.E. Amlak K.S. Zahedi K. Bissler J.J. Harrison R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 223: 97-119Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). That these enzymes were the predominant protease activity for IGFBP-5 in fibroblast-conditioned medium is proven by several points. First, during purification, other proteases that have been shown to cleave IGFBP-5, such as ASPO-5 and MMP-2 and -9 were removed by various chromatographic steps; however, most of the proteolytic activity was retained. Furthermore, when pure MMP-2, -9, or ASPO-5 are incubated with IGFBP-5, the rate of proteolysis is slow and the fragment sizes that are generated are distinct from those generated by the IGFBP-5 protease activity (7Nam T.J. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Finally, MMP-2 and -9 are not specific for IGFBP-5 and degrade other forms of IGF binding proteins. In contrast, the proteolytic activity in fibroblast media and the immunoaffinity-purified material were specific for IGFBP-5 and did not cleave other forms of IGF binding proteins. Second, immunoaffinity chromatography of partially purified conditioned medium showed that most of the IGFBP-5 protease activity in the medium could be accounted for by C1r and C1s that adhered to the antibody affinity column. Third, the specific C1s protease inhibitor, C1 inhibitor, inhibits IGFBP-5 cleavage by crude conditioned medium, and its ability to inhibit C1r and C1s activation correlates with its ability to inhibit IGFBP-5 proteolysis. Furthermore, extensive sequencing of all of the protein bands that were detected in the most highly purified material did not yield sequences corresponding to any other protease. Following immunoaffinity chromatography of fibroblast medium, approximately 84% of the IGFBP-5 proteolytic activity adhered to the column (data not shown). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that C1s is the predominant protease cleaving IGFBP-5 in fibroblast medium and C1r is responsible for its activation. Recently, it was shown that a part of the IGFBP-4 protease in fibroblast medium could be ascribed to PAPP-A, which is a metalloprotease (15Lawrence J.B. Qxuig C. Overgaard M.T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Harp L.G. Yates J.R. Conover C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3149-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). However, in that study PAPP-A was not purified to homogeneity, and therefore the results did not exclude the possibility that other proteases were present in fibroblast medium that could potentially degrade IGFBP-4. Furthermore, the extent to which any of these proteases is active is determined not just by the concentration of protease, but whether it is secreted as the zymogen, the percentage activation and whether protease inhibitors are present. When the secretion of C1r and C1s was analyzed using several test conditions, partial activation of these proteases was noted. Therefore, partially activated forms exist in fibroblast medium, making it more likely that they account for IGFBP-5 protease activity. The physiologic significance of activated C1r/C1s in fibroblast medium and their roles in modulating IGF-I actions remains to be determined. However, we have shown that a protease-resistant form of IGFBP-5 inhibits IGF-I actions (11Cambell P.G. Novak J.F. Yanosick T.B. MacMaster J.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1401-1412PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the fact that these proteases are present in the medium in partially activated forms that can cleave IGFBP-5 into fragments with very low affinity suggests that they are capable of modulating IGF-I bioactivity. Furthermore, inhibition of their activity with a specific inhibitor (e.g. C1 inhibitor) results in inhibition of IGFBP-5 cleavage, suggesting that activation can be modulated in physiologic fluids that contain this inhibitor. In additional studies, we have detected C1 inhibitor in fibroblast-conditioned medium by immunoblotting (data not shown). Therefore, the variables that regulate C1r and C1s synthesis and activation, as well as the secretion of C1 inhibitor, have the potential to alter IGFBP-5 cleavage and thereby modulate IGF-I actions. Other investigators have reported that activated C1r and C1s occur at sites outside the liver (25Davies A.E. Amlak K.S. Zahedi K. Bissler J.J. Harrison R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 223: 97-119Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Sakai H. Nakashima S. Yoshimura S. Nishimura Y. Sakai N. Nozawa Y. Gene. 1998; 209: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and that they have proteolytic functions other than complement activation (27Radley K. North J. Saunders D. Schwaeble W. Jezorsk M. Wollery D.E. Whaley K. Immunology. 1996; 88: 648-656PubMed Google Scholar, 28Moffat G.M. Leppin D. Birnie G. Whaley K. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1989; 78: 54PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vanagrechi K.

Acta. 1990; 1037: 2109-2115Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Specifically, pleural fluid and joint fluid contain activated C1r and C1s, as do cell culture supernatants from glial cells (25Davies A.E. Amlak K.S. Zahedi K. Bissler J.J. Harrison R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 223: 97-119Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Nissen M.H. Roepstorff P. Theisn L. Runber B. Fothergill J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Several central nervous system cell types have been shown to contain C1s peptide and messenger RNA. Spleen, liver, brain, and kidney have been shown to contain C1r and C1s mRNA (25Davies A.E. Amlak K.S. Zahedi K. Bissler J.J. Harrison R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 223: 97-119Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Several studies have also shown that C1r and C1s activation may lead to cleavage of peptides other than the complement components (27Radley K. North J. Saunders D. Schwaeble W. Jezorsk M. Wollery D.E. Whaley K. Immunology. 1996; 88: 648-656PubMed Google Scholar, 28Moffat G.M. Leppin D. Birnie G. Whaley K. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1989; 78: 54PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vanagrechi K.

Acta. 1990; 1037: 2109-2115Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and several of the proteins that have been shown to be substrates for C1s are not traditional components of the complement pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that C1r and C1s may have roles other than complement activation. For several years, investigators have hypothesized a linkage between inflammation (i.e. acute complement activation during injury) and subsequent cellular repair processes. Because IGF-I and IGFBP-5 are secreted by several cells, such as macrophages or fibroblasts, which are involved in repair that occurs in response to injury, and both peptides are present in pericellular fluids (32Sakiyawa H. Inaba N. Toyoguchi T. Okada Y. Matsumoto M. Moriya H. Ohtsu H. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 227: 239-245Google Scholar), on cell surfaces, and in extracellular matrix of several mesenchymal cell types (33Lovell A.B. Martensson U. Sjoholm A.G. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 129: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), it is possible that there is a coordinated linkage between activation of C1r and C1s during acute injury and the subsequent release of IGF-I to receptors that are present on the surface of cell types that are involved in tissue repair. IGFBP-5, which is also secreted by the connective tissue cell types that are involved in tissue repair (34Sakiyawa H. Yamaguchi K. Chiba K. Nagata K. Toniyama C. Matsumoto M. Suzuki G. Tanaka T. Tomosawa T. Yanubawa M. Kizia K. Sakiyama S. Ohtsu H. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 183-187PubMed Google Scholar, 35Katz Y. Gur S. Aladjem M. Strunk R.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 680: 2027-2032Google Scholar), could be an important component for controlling the amount of IGF-I that can be released to receptors after C1r and C1s activation (35Katz Y. Gur S. Aladjem M. Strunk R.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 680: 2027-2032Google Scholar). Whether such a linkage exists deserves further exploration. In summary, we have determined that the predominant protease component of fibroblast-conditioned medium is ascribable to the complement subcomponents C1r and C1s. C1s is the major protease that cleaves IGFBP-5, but its full activation requires the presence of activated C1r. Further studies are necessary to determine the physiologic role of these proteases in activating a cascade of events leading to IGF-I receptor stimulation.

It has been shown that defects of complex I are involved in many human mitochondrial diseases (5Schapira A.H.V. Biochim. Biophys.

Unfortunately, the cause of complex I dysfunction, namely mutations in the seven mtDNA-encoded subunits of complex I, are difficult to correct (7de Grey A.D.N.J. Trends Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 394-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Repair of mutations in subunit genes coded for by nDNA is also challenging, and success has been limited (8Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Scheffler I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a number of potential therapies can be envisioned (9Shoffner J.M. Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 535-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, for example, the intramitochondrial NAD/NADH ratio could be adjusted by oxidizing NADH with a number of membrane-permeable dyes. When attempted in vitro, however, the reduced forms of these dyes undergo oxidation by molecular oxygen, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are toxic. The other potential alternative that appears to be promising is to introduce the yeast-type single subunit NADH-Q oxidoreductase (Ndi1) into complex I-deficient mammalian mitochondria. In addition to its potential to correct the symptoms associated with complex I dysfunction, the use of yeast Ndi1 has an additional advantage since electron transfer with mammalian complex I is believed to be a one-electron reaction that involves FMN and a number of iron-sulfur clusters (10Hatefi Y. Ragan C.I. Galante Y.M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 1-70Google Scholar, 11Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the Ndi1 bears FAD as cofactors and appears to be a two-electron reaction enzyme (12de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, the mammalian complex I generates ubiquinone radicals as intermediate products that have been demonstrated to react with oxygen to produce ROS that are considered to be one of the causes of aging and cell death (13Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). Introduction of the two-electron enzyme, Ndi1, should eliminate the complications associated with free radicals generated by the mammalian complex I. Therefore, our goal is to develop the incorporation of the yeast Ndi1 enzyme into human mitochondria as a potential remedy for complex I defects. As described previously (14Kitajima-Ihara T. Yagi T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the yeast mitochondrial protein Ndi1, which is encoded by nDNA, is a versatile enzyme because the Ndi1 enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli functions as a member of the respiratory chain in the prokaryotic host cells. Furthermore, we have shown that Ndi1 can be functionally expressed in the Chinese hamster mutant cell line (CCL16B2) lacking the MWFE subunit of complex I (8Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T.

Acta. 1999; 1412: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the transfection procedures employed (calcium phosphate precipitation and lipofection methods using the pHook-2 vector) will have limitations when applied in vivo. First, transfection is either very difficult or practically impossible to achieve in many of human cell lines. Second, mitochondrial defects often occur in nonproliferating or slowly proliferating tissues. Therefore, successful therapy will require that NDI1 can be expressed in differentiated and non-dividing cells. Recently, adeno-associated virus (AAV) expression systems have been developed for the expression of genes in nonproliferating cells (17Muzyczka N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,18Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (3936) Google Scholar). AAV vectors have been used to deliver a number of different genes into a variety of target tissues both in vitro and in vivo, thus demonstrating the significant potential of this virus in the treatment of human diseases (19Flotte T.R.

In contrast to the more commonly used retroviral and adenoviral vectors, AAV is a non-pathogenic human parvovirus, does not elicit antibodies against itself, and has high possibility for long term expression of transgenes (24Flotte T.R.

We have used the NDI1-recombinant AAV vectors and expressed the NDI1 gene in growth-arrested human cells. An rAAV proviral plasmid, pCB-NDI1, designed to express the full-lengthNDI1 gene from the cytomegalovirus/β-actin hybrid (CB) promoter, was constructed as follows. An rAAV-CB-hAAT construct 2I.Virella-Lowell, B. Zusman, T. Conlon, K. A. Chestnut, T. Ferkol, and T. R. Flotte, unpublished results. was digested withNotI and EcoRI leaving the rAAV backbone and the CB promoter with NotI- and EcoRI-compatible ends. The NDI1 gene was then released from the pPCRScript Amp SK(+) vector with NotI and EcoRI, and this fragment was ligated into the rAAV backbone to produce the pAAV-CB-NDI1 plasmid. The rAAV proviral plasmid, pAAV-CB-NDI1, was then packaged into rAAV virions by double-transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells and purified by iodixanol step-gradient centrifugation followed by heparin sulfate column chromatography as described previously (25Zolotukhin S.

The human 143B cells (1 × 105) in 1 ml of DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum were infected with 9 × 108 infectious units of rAAV-NDI1 virions. The transduced cells were isolated by screening in the DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum + 0.1 μm rotenone in the presence of 5 mm galactose and were grown in the same media. Cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/ml onto 6-well plates (105cells/well) and were harvested and counted every 24 h using a hemocytometer. Viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion. Cell number was counted in triplicate. Cells were mitotically arrested by treatment with aphidicolin which is an inhibitor of the DNA polymerases α and δ (26Huberman J.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 647-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 27Byrnes J.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 62: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The HEK 293 and human 143B cells were cultured by seeding triplicate 6-well plates at approximately 1 × 106 cells per well (1–2 × 106 cells in 1 ml of medium) and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, HEK 293 and 143B cells were placed in a medium containing aphidicolin at 5 μg/ml for 24 h or at 10 μg/ml for 17 h, respectively. On day 2, drug-treated cells and untreated controls were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended at 2–3 × 105 cells/ml aliquoted into 1-ml samples, and subsequently kept on ice. To a 1-ml sample of cell suspension, 2 ml of ice-cold methanol was added dropwise while gently mixing and then incubated on ice for at least 30 min. At this point, samples were either stained immediately with propidium iodide or stored at 4 °C for up to 5 days before staining. For staining, samples were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellets were suspended in 500 μl of 0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide (or 20 μg/ml) stain solution. Subsequently, 500 μl of DNase-free RNase A was added to a final concentration of 100 units/ml. Samples were again vortexed, incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min, and then stored on ice in the dark for up to 1 h before they were subjected to flow cytometric analysis on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For each sample, 10,000 events were counted with the FL2 parameters. Data were collected using the data acquisition program CELLQuest (Becton Dickinson). Histograms were analyzed with the WinMDI program (Joseph Trotter, The Scripps Research Institute). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Measurements of respiratory chain activities were performed using digitonin-permeabilized cells as reported previously (15Seo B.B. Kitajima-Ihara T. Chan E.K. Scheffler I.E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T.

Med. 1987; 166: 1627-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was done using anti-Ndi1 antibody and a mitochondria-directed fluorescent probe, Mito Tracker Red (Molecular Probes). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out by the modified method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205522) Google Scholar). Any variations from the procedures and other details are described in the figure legends. The HEK 293 cells and the human 143B cells were from American Type Culture Collection; 0.4% trypan blue solution, flavone, rotenone, and antimycin A were from Sigma; 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA); anti-rabbit IgG, heavy and light chain (goat) fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, aphidicolin, and ribonuclease A were from Calbiochem; fetal bovine serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without glucose and sodium pyruvate were from Life Technologies, Inc.; trypsin EDTA 1× solution, 1× phosphate-buffered saline were from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA); 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing mounting medium was from Vector Laboratories, Inc.

Acta. 1999; 1412: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we have successfully introduced the yeast Ndi1 enzyme into mitochondria of the Chinese hamster cells and HEK 293 cells. The expressed protein was functional and was able to restore the respiratory activities of those cells that were defective in complex I. The method of gene transfer used, however, involved use of chemicals and, thus, had some limitations. For example, the transfer efficiency was generally low. Also, by using this technique we were unable to transfect other human cells such as the osteosarcoma 143B cells. In order for this technique to be developed into a possible gene replacement therapy, it must work not only on dividing cells but also with non-dividing or growth-arrested cells and, ultimately, tissues. Thus, it was essential to develop another method of transfection. For this purpose, we turned to recombinant technology and constructed a recombinant AAV proviral plasmid containing a full-length NDI1 gene. This recombinant proviral plasmid, rAAV-NDI1, was then used to transfect HEK 293 cells. Immunofluorescence microscopic analyses using antibodies directed against the yeast Ndi1 polypeptide and a fluorescent probe selective for mitochondria indicated that the expressed Ndi1 was predominantly localized in the mitochondria of the 293 cells (data not shown). rAAV-NDI1 virions were then produced from the rAAV proviral plasmid as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” and were used to infect the human 143B cells. The efficiency of transduction as observed in immunofluorescent staining ranged from 50 to 90%. The expression of the Ndi1 protein was retained after 4 months of continuous culture. Fig. 1 shows the respiratory activities of the nontransduced 143B cells (control) and the NDI1-transduced 143B cells (rAAV-NDI1). In the case of the nontransduced cells, oxygen consumption in the presence of the respiratory substrates malate/glutamate was inhibited by addition of rotenone, a complex I inhibitor, but enhanced by the following addition of succinate. By contrast, the respiratory activities of theNDI1-transduced cells in the presence of glutamate/malate was insensitive to rotenone but sensitive to flavone, an inhibitor of Ndi1. Furthermore, antimycin A inhibited this respiration completely. These results indicate that the expressed Ndi1 enzyme functions as an upstream member of the respiratory chain of the cell. HEK 293 cells transfected with the rAAV-NDI1 vector showed similar results (data not shown) which were basically the same as those obtained with the pHook-mediated transfection (16Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Figure 1Respiratory activities of digitonin-permeabilized human 143B cells. The cells were harvested by trypsinization and treated with 50–150 μg of digitonin until more than 90% of cells were stained by trypan blue. Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically in 0.6 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.1), 250 mm sucrose, and 10 mm MgCl2 by using a Clarke-type electrode in a water-jacketed chamber maintained at 37 °C. Upper trace,non-transduced control cells at 2 × 107 cells/ml.Lower trace, cells transduced with rAAV-NDI1 at 6 × 107 cells/ml. Where indicated, 5 mm glutamate (Glu), 5 mm malate (Mal), 5 μm rotenone (Rot), 0.5 mm flavone, 5 mm succinate (Succ), and 5 μmantimycin A (AntA) were added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To ascertain our ability to transfect non-dividing cells using the rAAV-NDI1 virions, it was necessary to establish conditions for arresting cell growth. We used aphidicolin that blocks nuclear DNA replication without interfering with mitochondrial DNA synthesis (30Zimmermann W. Chen S.M. Bolden A. Weissbach A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11847-11852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were treated with aphidicolin, and the DNA content was examined with a flow cytometer. As shown in Fig. 2, cells incubated with 5 μg/ml aphidicolin for 24 h were primarily in the S phase, whereas the control cells, without the inhibitor, exhibited a normal distribution of growth phases. The same results were obtained with 143B cells (data not shown). To ascertain further the extent to which growth was arrested, we monitored the number of cells for up to 3 days after the aphidicolin treatment (Fig. 3). At the end of 24 h of incubation (labeled 0 h), the number of cells remained the same when aphidicolin was present but doubled if no inhibitor was added. Furthermore, after aphidicolin was removed from the media, the treated cells remained viable for a few days without showing appreciable increase in the cell number. Thus it is clear that both HEK 293 and 143B cells stopped dividing when they were treated with aphidicolin. After growth arrest was confirmed, the 143B cells were infected with the rAAV-NDI1 particles. The success of the transduction and the subsequent expression of Ndi1 enzyme was shown using immunofluorescence as illustrated in Fig. 4. This is in contrast to our earlier attempts using the pHook vector which gave rise to no transfection. The overall transduction efficiency was typically in the range of 50–80% (see below for further discussion). The degree of expression, however, seems to vary as is evident in Fig. 4 where cells overexpressing the protein appear brighter (green) and those expressing less are fainter. Results with growth-arrested HEK 293 cells were similar (data not shown). Thus, the expression levels of Ndi1 in non-dividing cells were at least equivalent to those in actively proliferating cells. Although these data confirmed successful transduction and expression in the growth-arrested cells, it was still necessary to make certain that the expressed Ndi1 was functionally active and did not harm cell metabolism. To confirm this point, we carried out the experiment illustrated in Fig. 5. First, 143B cells were incubated with aphidicolin to arrest the cell cycle. When this was complete, cells were infected with the rAAV-NDI1 virions. After 24 h, cells were placed in a medium containing the complex I inhibitor, rotenone, and provided with galactose, instead of glucose, as the carbon source. Under these conditions, glycolysis is too slow to sustain the cell, and energy must be provided by oxidative phosphorylation (31Scheffler I.E. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 77-109Crossref Google Scholar); therefore, non-transduced cells are expected to die because the respiration is blocked by rotenone at the level of complex I. The data show that the cells infected with rAAV-NDI1 survived under the non-glycolytic conditions. In the case of control cells that did not receive the NDI1 gene, the number of viable cells under the same conditions was reduced to <10% within a day and almost zero by the end of the 2nd day. It is interesting to note that the sustained viability of the transduced cells in the presence of rotenone and galactose was exactly the same as that observed with the non-transduced cells kept in the glucose medium after the growth arrest (Fig. 3 B). These data clearly demonstrate that the Ndi1 enzyme is able to support respiration in the growth-arrested cells and that the enzyme does not harm the cell in other ways.Figure 5Survival of NDI1-transduced cells in the presence of complex I inhibitor. The 143B cells were growth-arrested by the aphidicolin treatment (10 μg/ml for 17 h) followed by incubation in fresh medium for 8 h. The growth-arrested cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml AAV-NDI1 for another 24 h. Both NDI1-infected cells and noninfected cells were placed in a medium containing 0.1 μm rotenone and 5 mm galactose to disallow glycolysis. At 24 and 48 h after the medium change, cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion, and cell number was determined by using a hemocytometer. Each measurement was done in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig.6 illustrates the effects of complex I inhibitors on cell growth of non-transduced andNDI1-transduced 143B cells. In the upper panels, the medium contained galactose as the carbon source with or without rotenone (left) or MPP+ (right) as the complex I inhibitor. As explained for the experiment in Fig. 5, cells depend on oxidative phosphorylation for the energy source in this medium (non-glycolytic conditions), and inhibition of the electron transfer at the level of complex I leads to cell death within 2–3 days. This is clearly seen for the non-transduced control cells. On the contrary, the NDI1-transduced cells were able to grow in the presence of rotenone almost to the same extent as that of control cells cultured without rotenone. Addition of MPP+ seems to have some retarding effect when compared with rotenone on the growth of the transduced cells. This could be due to possible secondary actions of MPP+ (see, for example, Refs. 32Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 189: 47-52Google Scholar, 33Adams Jr., J.D. Klaidman L.K. Leung A.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Desai V.G. Feuers R.J. Hart R.W. Ali S.F. Brain Res. 1996; 715: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These data clearly indicate that the Ndi1 protein renders the cells resistant to complex I inhibitors by providing an alternative means to oxidize NADH. In thelower panels, the same set of experiments were carried out in a medium containing high glucose to allow glycolysis. Under these conditions, all cells, regardless of the transduction, can now grow in the presence of added inhibitors. In other words, the inhibitory effects of rotenone and MPP+ are only observed when NADH oxidation is taking place. We have previously shown that the yeast Ndi1 protein is a versatile enzyme and can be used to supplement complex I-deficient cells (15Seo B.B. Kitajima-Ihara T. Chan E.K. Scheffler I.E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9167-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, use of chemicals or liposomes as the gene delivery techniques, although convenient in in vitroexperiments, may be restricted in clinical applications because of relatively low transfection efficiencies and other limitations. Viral vectors, on the other hand, have advantages in that they can be used to transduce quiescent cells such as hepatocytes, myocytes, and neurons and that the gene can be integrated into the DNA of the host cell so that it will be replicated (in dividing cells) and expressed indefinitely (35Robbins P.D. Ghivizzani S.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 36Klimatcheva E. Rosenblatt J.D. Planelles V. Front.

Craik C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 168-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We chose recombinant AAV vector because AAV has not been implicated as the causative agent for any diseases, does not elicit antibodies against itself, and supports long term transgene expression (17Muzyczka N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D.

U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10613-10617Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrated that rAAV can be used to deliver theNDI1 gene into non-dividing human cells. The transduction efficiency is as high as 80% as judged by immunofluorescence. However, these numbers could be underestimates. As seen in Fig. 5, the number of viable cells remained at the same level when glucose was replaced with galactose, just as observed with the normal cells in a corresponding experiment of growth arrest but being kept in the glucose medium (Fig.3 B). This implies nearly a 100% expression level because any cells that do not have functional Ndi1 fail to survive under these conditions, and thus the number of viable cells would have declined accordingly if a fraction of the cells did not have active Ndi1. It is likely that immunofluorescent staining revealed only highly expressing cells and that lower amounts of Ndi1 may be sufficient to sustain the cells. It should be noted that, in the experiment of Fig. 5, no selection was made after the rAAV infection before the cells were tested for survival under non-glycolytic conditions. This indicates that because cell division had been prevented, the sustained number of viable cells should represent a high efficacy of transduction but was not a result of a balance between new growth of surviving cells and death of non-transduced cells. It is also noteworthy to add that the presence of “excess” Ndi1 protein does not have negative impact on cell growth. This point is evident from the results shown in Fig. 6 as well. When cells are grown glycolytically, addition of complex I inhibitors has little or no effect on cell viability. Successful introduction of functional Ndi1 protein into mitochondria of non-proliferating cells is a significant step forward toward the clinical applications of this protein as a remedy for complex I defects. Its seemingly non-toxic nature is important especially because targeted tissues are often populated with both normal cells and cells with varying degrees of deficiency. In addition to the efficiency, longevity of gene expression is another important factor to consider. Once again AAV appears to excel here because of its ability to integrate into chromosomes. Of course, use of AAV vectors are not always without complications. Although it is expected that its immunoreactivity is conceivably low compared with other viral vectors such as adenoviruses, this must be critically tested with in vivo experiments (39Hernandez Y.J. Wang J. Kearns W.G. Loiler S. Poirier A. Flotte T.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8549-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another concern might be that the Ndi1 protein is foreign to humans, possibly leading to host immune response. There are, however, a number of encouraging reports where non-self proteins were successfully expressed, and repeated injections could be carried out in animal models (40Beck S.E. Jones L.A. Chesnut K. Walsh S.M. Reynolds T.C. Carter B.J. Askin F.B. Flotte T.R. Guggino W.B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9446-9455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Jooss K. Yang Y. Fisher K.J. Wilson J.M. J.

Tissue-specific expression is another subject that will need to be addressed. Fortunately, a variety of promoters are being developed. In conclusion, it is highly likely that what was made possible with the yeast Ndi1 protein can be extended to other proteins that have to be targeted into mitochondria at the desired location with full activities.

The three-dimensional structure of the plant-specific insert resembles that of saposin-like proteins, a group of lipid-binding proteins involved in a variety of physiological processes. Here we show that recombinant plant-specific insert is able to interact with phospholipid vesicles and to induce leakage of their contents in a pH- and lipid-dependent manner. The leakage activity is higher at pH 4.5 and requires the presence of acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine. To determine whether the same effect could be observed when the plant-specific insert is part of the precursor form, procardosin A and a mutant form lacking this specific domain were produced and characterized. Procardosin A displays a similar activity profile, whereas the mutant without the plant-specific insert shows only residual activity. These findings indicate that the plant-specific insert domain of plant aspartic proteinases mediates an interaction of their precursors with phospholipid membranes and induces membrane permeabilization. It is therefore possible that the plant-specific insert, alone or in conjunction with the proteolytic activity of plant aspartic proteinases, may function either as a defensive weapon against pathogens or in late autolysis of plant cells.

A unique feature present in most aspartic proteinases of plant origin is an extra protein domain of about 100 amino acids, generally named plant-specific insert (PSI)1, that has no homology to any other aspartic protease sequence (2White P.C.

An important role in the vacuolar targeting of aspartic proteinase precursors has been proposed, either by its direct interaction with the membrane, where it would act as a targeting signal (4Guruprasad K. Törmäkangas K. Kervinen J. Blundell T.L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), or by the interaction of a putative membrane binding region, formed by a cluster of the mature protein and the PSI in prophytepsin, with the membrane itself or with a receptor in the Golgi apparatus (7Kervinen J. Tobin G.J. Costa J. Waugh D.S. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It has been suggested (8Faro C. Ramalho-Santos M. Vieira M. Mendes A.

Verı́ssimo P. Cortes L. Samyn B. van Beeumen J. Pires E. Faro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the PSI could be implicated in the correct folding of the enzyme, as suggested by the lack of activation of a mutant of recombinant procyprosin bearing a deletion of the PSI sequence (2White P.C.

The plant-specific insert bears high homology with a family of proteins, the saposin-like proteins (SAPLIPs). This family includes proteins such as saposins A, B, C, and D, NK-lysin, granulysin, surfactant protein B, amoebapores, and domains of acid sphingomyelinase and acyloxyacyl hydrolase (9Liepinsh E.

The PSI is not a true saposin but a swaposin, corresponding to a permutation of amino- and carboxyl-terminal saposin fragments, where the C-terminal portion of one saposin is linked by a sequence of about 20 amino acids to the N-terminal portion of the other saposin (10Ponting C.P. Russel R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 179-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The sequence homology of this family of proteins resides in three conserved disulfide bridges, a set of hydrophobic residues, and a consensus glycosylation site. The structure of NK-lysin was elucidated by NMR, revealing five α-helices folded into a single globular domain. The hydrophobic conserved residues are located in the interior of the globular domain, whereas solvent-exposed side chains are those belonging to less conserved amino acid residues in the SAPLIP family (9Liepinsh E. Andersson M. Ruysschaert J.M. Otting G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of prophytepsin, the precursor of the aspartic protease of barley, was reported, revealing that the PSI forms an independent globular domain with five α-helices, quite similar to the structure described for NK-lysin (7Kervinen J. Tobin G.J. Costa J. Waugh D.S. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Because of the homology within the saposin-like proteins, the proteins of this family most probably share the five α-helical globular structure. The proteins belonging to the SAPLIP group are implicated in different physiological functions. Saposins are involved in the lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids (11Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); NK-lysin has antibacterial activity and the capability to lyse tumor cells but not red blood cells (13Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. Homblé F. Andersson M. Liepinsh E. Otting G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); granulysin has antimicrobial activity (12Stenger S. Hanson D.A. Teitelbaum R. Dewan P. Niazi K.R. Froelich C.J. Ganz T. Thoma-Uszynsky S. Melián A. Bogdan C. Porcelli S.A. Bloom B.R. Krensky A.M. Modlin R.L. Science. 1998; 282: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar); and surfactant protein B has an important function in the reduction of the surface tension of pulmonary surfactant (14Beck D.C. Ikegami M. Na C.-L. Zaltash S. Johansson J. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3365-3370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, amoebapores, the pore-forming peptides of Entamoeba histolytica, induce lysis of bacteria and eukaryotic cells (15Leippe M. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The common theme among these proteins appears to be the membrane interaction required for their specific functions. We have been studying two aspartic proteinases from the flowers of the cardoon Cynara cardunculus L., cardosin A and B (16Verı́ssimo P. Faro C. Moir A.J. Lin X. Tang J. Pires E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cardosin A, the most abundant, is produced as a single chain zymogen, procardosin A, from which the PSI and the N-terminal propeptide segment are removed to render an active two-chain enzyme (5Ramalho-Santos M. Verı́ssimo P. Cortes L. Samyn B. van Beeumen J. Pires E. Faro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The enzyme is mainly detected in pistils, where it accumulates in protein storage vacuoles of the epidermic papillae of the stigma, the pollen-receptive surface, and in a lesser degree in the vacuolar protein masses of epidermic cells of the style (5Ramalho-Santos M. Verı́ssimo P. Cortes L. Samyn B. van Beeumen J. Pires E. Faro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that expression of cardosin A is developmentally regulated. High levels of mRNA have been identified in the first stages of floral development; then the precursor is converted into the mature form as the flower matures and is accumulated until the later stages of flower senescence, where no mRNA is found (8Faro C. Ramalho-Santos M. Vieira M. Mendes A. Simões I. Andrade R. Verı́ssimo P. Lin X. Tang J. Pires E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28724-28729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The function of cardosin has not been completely clarified, but the data collected so far suggest an involvement in pollen-pistil interaction (17Ramalho-Santos M. Pissarra J. Verı́ssimo P. Pereira S. Salema R. Pires E. Faro C. Planta. 1997; 203: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), most probably in adhesion-mediated proteolytic mechanisms associated with pollen tube growth (8Faro C. Ramalho-Santos M. Vieira M. Mendes A. Simões I. Andrade R. Verı́ssimo P. Lin X. Tang J. Pires E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28724-28729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and a possible role in defense mechanisms against pathogens or invasion (17Ramalho-Santos M. Pissarra J. Verı́ssimo P. Pereira S. Salema R. Pires E. Faro C. Planta. 1997; 203: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To elucidate the function of the plant-specific insert of procardosin A, taking into account the homology between this protein domain and the SAPLIP members, we cloned and expressed recombinant PSI and studied its interaction with membrane vesicles. The membrane interaction of recombinant procardosin A and of a mutated procardosin A lacking the PSI was also determined. To our knowledge this is the first report on the ability of the plant-specific insert, a SAPLIP of plant origin, to interact with membranes and induce vesicle leakage. The sequence coding for the plant-specific insert of procardosin A was amplified by PCR using as a template a full-length precursor cDNA clone of cardosin A, obtained by the method described in Faro et al. (8Faro C. Ramalho-Santos M. Vieira M. Mendes A. Simões I. Andrade R. Verı́ssimo P. Lin X. Tang J. Pires E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28724-28729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The primers 5′-TGAAGTGGATAAGTGTTCAC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCGTCATGAACCAGCAATGC-3′ (forward and reverse, respectively) were used for the amplification. The reverse primer introduced a BamHI restriction site, allowing for directed cloning into the expression vector pGEX-1λT. The PCR product was cloned in pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). This vector was digested with BamHI/EcoRI, and the insert was subcloned into the pGEX-1λT vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Positive clones were selected by restriction analyses, and the correct orientation was confirmed by sequencing on a Vistra DNA Automatic Sequencer 725 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The procardosin A (pCA) cDNA was cloned as described previously (8Faro C. Ramalho-Santos M. Vieira M. Mendes A. Simões I. Andrade R. Verı́ssimo P. Lin X. Tang J. Pires E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28724-28729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The construction of the mutant cDNA of procardosin A without the PSI sequence (pCA#PSI) was as follows. Using a cDNA encoding the full-length cardosin A as template, a first PCR reaction was performed with Pfu polymerase. The product thus obtained (PCR1) had the prepro sequence and the 31-kDa chain coding regions of cardosin A cDNA followed by 4 glycines in the corresponding C terminus. A second PCR reaction withPfu polymerase enzyme using the same full-length cDNA of cardosin A as template yielded one fragment (PCR2) that corresponded to the 15-kDa chain of cardosin A with the same 4 glycine sequence in its N terminus. The two PCR fragments (PCR1 and PCR2) were fused in a blunt-ended ligation reaction using T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The pCA#PSI cDNA was then obtained through a PCR reaction with the enzyme Taq polymerase using the ligation product as template and the same primers used to amplify procardosin A withNheI sites in the 5′ ends. The amplified product was purified, cloned in pCR 2.1 vector, and later subcloned into theNheI site of the pET11-b vector (Novagene, Madison, WI) for expression. The correct cloning direction of positive clones was confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant plasmid (pGEX-PSI) coding for the plant-specific insert was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21, and the recombinant PSI was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase. Bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 1.0. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 2 h at 30 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (4 °C, 8000 ×g, 10 min) and washed with 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.3 (phosphate-buffered saline). The recovery of the fusion protein was done according to the method of Frangioni and Neel (18Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were treated with lysozyme (100 μg/ml) in 10 mm Tris pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA for 15 min on ice. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. The protein was then solubilized by the addition of the detergentN-laurylsarcosine (Sigma Aldrich Quimica) to a final concentration of 0.25%, and the resulting mixture was sonicated for 1 min in a water bath (Sonorex RK100H). Clarification of the lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. Triton X-100 was added to the supernatant at the same molar ratio as N-laurylsarcosine, and the protein solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the affinity resin glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), previously equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. The hydrolysis of PSI from the glutathione S-transferase was performed with the addition of thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 24 h at 20 °C with the fusion protein still bound to the resin. The resulting fraction of PSI was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography in a Hitrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris pH 8.0 and eluted with a sodium chloride gradient. Recombinant PSI purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Phast system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GlutathioneS-transferase was produced by the above procedure, using the vector pGEX-1λT without any insertion, and used as a control protein. Both recombinant proteins (pCA and pCA#PSI) were synthesized as “inclusion bodies” in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). The cells were grown to an A600 nmof 0.5–0.7 at 30 °C. At this time, the expression of the proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the incubation at 30 °C was continued for an additional 2–3 h. After this period the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 25 min at 3000 × g and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.15 mNaCl (TN buffer). Lysozyme (4 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min. After freezing at −80 °C overnight and thawing, 2 mm MgCl2 and 2 units/ml DNase were added, and the homogenized solution was kept for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. The solution was then diluted with TN buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and further stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and the “inclusion bodies” were recovered by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min. The final pellet was dissolved in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and stirred overnight at 4 °C to solubilize the recombinant material. The soluble material was dialyzed for 24 h against 25 mmTris pH 8.0 at 4 °C with continuous agitation. Precipitates, which formed, were removed by centrifugation. The clear supernatant was then applied to a Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in 25 mm Tris pH 8.0 at a flow rate of 20.4 ml/h. The fractions with the recombinant proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and further fractionated on a fast protein liquid chromatography anion-exchange Hitrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The elution was developed with a gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Purity of the recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Phast system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The identity of the recombinant plant-specific insert was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of an electroblotted sample of purified protein (Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer, Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems). The purity of the expressed PSI was also assessed by reverse-phase HPLC in a C4 column (Vydac), equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, at 1 ml/min. Elution of the bound PSI was accomplished with a linear gradient of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 35 min. The recombinant PSI was additionally subjected to size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in 20 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, at 24 ml/h. Apparent molecular mass was calculated by interpolation on an elution volume versus log (molecular mass) calibration curve for four protein standards: bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), cytochrome c(12.4 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). Protein was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce), using lysozyme as the standard protein. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit, using 1-mm path length cells. Samples were extensively dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, and CD spectra of the dialysis buffer were subtracted from the protein spectra. Spectropolarimeter calibration and cell path length were verified using d-10-camphorsulfonic acid. To quantitate the secondary structure content of PSI we used the program CONTIN (19Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27 (229–242): 213-227Crossref Scopus (2623) Google Scholar), running on an SGi Octane. l-α-Phosphatidylserine (PS),l-α-phosphatidic acid (PA),l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC), andl-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared by filter exclusion of multilamellar liposomes using a high pressure apparatus (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Dried lipid films of the desired compositions were hydrated by extensive vortexing in 10 mm Hepes, 140 mmNaCl, pH 7.4 for tryptophan fluorescence measurements, or in 80 mm calcein (Sigma), 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, for the leakage assays. The resulting multilamellar liposomes were extruded six times through two stacked polycarbonate filters (pore size 0.1 μm; Nucleopore) under a stream of N2. Free calcein was separated from the dye-containing LUV by size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-75 column. Phospholipid concentration was measured by the method of Fiske and Subbarow (20Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid composition of the vesicles was as indicated in the text and figure legends. The leakage of liposome contents was monitored by the release of encapsulated calcein at a self-quenching concentration. The leakage experiments were carried out at 37 °C, and fluorescence measurements were performed in a Fluorolog spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries, Edison, NY) equipped with a constant-temperature cell holder and stirrer. The experiments were carried out in 10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 or 20 mm Mes, 140 mmnaCl, pH 4.5–6.0. After protein addition, the leakage of calcein into the external medium was monitored by the increase in fluorescence caused by the relief of self-quenching upon calcein dilution (excitation 494 nm, slit width 0.5; emission 517 nm, slit width 1.5). Baseline fluorescence (0%) was determined before protein addition, and complete leakage (100%) was established by lysing the liposomes with 40 mm C12E8 (octaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether, Sigma). The intrinsic fluorescence of the sole tryptophan residue of the plant-specific insert was measured at 37 °C in a Spex Fluorolog spectrofluorometer equipped with a constant-temperature cell holder. The emission spectra were obtained by exciting PSI samples (0.5 μm) at 280 nm (0.7 nm slit width) and scanning emission from 290 to 420 nm (1.2 nm slit width). The fluorescence spectra of PSI were recorded in the presence and absence of LUV (100 μm) composed of PA/PE/PS (1:1:1) and PC/PE (1:1). The spectra were corrected for the intrinsic fluorescence of buffer and phospholipids (scattering). The sequence corresponding to the plant-specific insert of procardosin A was cloned into pGEX-1λT and expressed as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase. Although the levels of expression of the fusion protein in the culture were high, the purification of the protein upon solubilization with Triton X-100 yielded low protein amounts. The presence of six cysteine residues and a set of hydrophobic amino acids in PSI may account for the increased insolubility of the fusion protein. Different extraction protocols were used to improve PSI recovery, including methods of solubilization of inclusion bodies, without significant increases in protein yield. Limited success was obtained when the detergent N-laurylsarcosine, which is known to reduce protein-protein interactions, was included in the purification procedure. The soluble fusion protein thus obtained (glutathione S-transferase-PSI) was hydrolyzed with thrombin, allowing the independent recovery of PSI. However, this protein fraction showed a two-protein molecular weight band profile in SDS-PAGE. The addition of a mixture of protease inhibitors during extraction and purification did not alter the two-protein band profile; thus an additional purification step was required. The two proteins were efficiently separated by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 1). The final yield of PSI expression and purification varied between 150–200 μg/liter of culture. The identity of the purified PSI was confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing. The recombinant PSI was judged to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE, presenting an apparent molecular mass of about 12,400 Da, a value that is in close agreement with that calculated from the amino acid sequence. The homogeneity of the protein sample was further confirmed by reverse-phase HPLC, where a single protein peak was detected (Fig. 2 A) and by size-exclusion chromatography, where recombinant PSI was eluted in a volume corresponding to 19,000 Da (Fig. 2 B).Figure 1SDS-PAGE of purified plant-specific insert.

PSI was also analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column, equilibrated in 20 mm phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 at 24 ml/h (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To evaluate the secondary structure content of the plant-specific insert, we recorded its far-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 3). A qualitative interpretation of the spectrum, which shows double minima around 207 and 222 nm, indicates the presence of a large percentage of α-helix in the protein. This clearly agrees with what is observed for the plant-specific insert in the crystal structure of the zymogen prophytepsin from barley (7Kervinen J. Tobin G.J. Costa J. Waugh D.S. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this structure, the plant-specific domain of prophytepsin also shows a high percentage of α-helix. To gain a better insight into the properties and functions of the plant-specific insert, we investigated the interaction of the protein with phospholipid vesicles. This interaction was first determined by the pH-dependent release of the fluorescent probe calcein, trapped inside the vesicles. The influence of the phospholipid composition of the vesicles on leakage was also studied. For all the phospholipid compositions tested the leakage induced by PSI was found to be pH-dependent, with calcein release increasing with decreasing pH (Fig. 4). At physiological pH no calcein release was observed, and at pH 6.0 only residual leakage was detected from vesicles consisting of either PA/PE or PA/PE/PS. As the pH turned into more acidic values, both the initial rates and extents of leakage increased. This effect was more notorious in PA/PE/PS vesicles, where at pH 4.5 most of the leakage was achieved within the first minute (Fig. 4 A). At pH 5.0, although the extent of calcein release was smaller than at pH 4.5, again more than 50% of the leakage observed after 10 min of incubation was detected at the first minute after protein addition. However, despite the rapid and extensive calcein release at pH 4.5, complete (100%) leakage was not observed. In PA/PE vesicles a pH-dependent calcein release was also found, although overall values of leakage were smaller. Once more, 50% of the leakage extent observed was detected at the first minute of the experiment. On the other hand, when vesicles of PC/PE were tested, only marginal levels of probe release were measured, either at acidic or neutral pH (data not shown). GlutathioneS-transferase was used as a control protein, and its leakage activity was tested at the same concentration as PSI. However, glutathione S-transferase showed no ability to induce calcein release. Altogether these results indicate that the PSI"

Like most cystic fibrosis-causing mutations, expression of ΔF508 CFTR in mammalian cell culture systems does not result in the formation of a cAMP activated chloride channel at the cell surface (3Rich D.P.

ΔF508 CFTR is functional if it reaches the cell surface, but it fails to do so in cellular systems, because it cannot reach stable B and is therefore not processed from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The molecular chaperone hsc70 has been implicated in retaining misfolded ΔF508 CFTR in the ER (9Yang Y. Janich S. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At least two proteins are identified complexed with hsp90 when newly synthesized: p56 lck (14Hartson S.D. Barrett D.J. Burn P. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13451-13459Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the reovirus cell attachment protein, ς1 (15Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Lee P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15227-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the case of the latter protein, hsc70 and hsp90 binding sites on the protein overlap, and because both are involved in the same maturation stages of the protein, it has been suggested that they act cooperatively. This hypothesis is supported by the evidence that these two proteins are found in physical association in the cytosol (the so-called “foldosome” complex (16Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Like its 70-kDa counterpart, hsp90 is implicated in mediating the degradation as well as folding of proteins in the cytoplasm (17Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Whitesell L. Sutphin P. An W.G. Sculte T. Blagosklonny M.V.

A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Indeed hsp90 appears to have strong links to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that mediates the degradation of, among others, wild type and ΔF508 CFTR (11Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 12Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The antibiotic geldanamycin is a specific hsp90 binding agent that has been used to elucidate the role of hsp90 in various cellular processes. A benzoquinone ansamycin, it shows a wide range of biological activities as a result of inhibition of hsp90 function (21Whitesell L. Shifrin S.D. Schwab G. Neckers L.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1721-1728PubMed Google Scholar, 22Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). These include inhibition of steroid hormone receptor function and destabilization of Raf-1 and other components of the mitogenic pathway; hence, the drug is profoundly cytostatic. Although originally thought to occupy an amino-terminal substrate binding site (23Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar), geldanamycin appears to occupy the ATP binding site on the chaperone (24Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Hence it stops ATP binding and prevents the normal function of the amino-terminal substrate binding site of hsp90. Here evidence is presented that interference with the normal function of hsp90 in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) with geldanamycin reduces degradation of ΔF508 CFTR and disrupts a chaperone complex such that the protein is no longer presented for ubiquitination. A model for the role of hsp90 and hsc70 in mediating ubiquitination of CFTR is proposed. The TNT T7 coupled transcription/translation RRL and canine pancreatic microsomal membranes were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against hsc70 (clone IB5), hsp90 (clone 16F1), and ubiquitin were supplied by StressGen Biotechnologies and a carboxyl-terminal-specific antibody to CFTR was supplied by Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Protein G-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [35S]Methionine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Geldanamycin was a generous gift from Dr. David Newman at the United States National Cancer Institute. Wild type and ΔF508 CFTR cDNAs were supplied by Dr. Deborah Gill at the University of Oxford. The cDNA fragment from the NheI site at the 5′ end of the CFTR cDNA to the SpeI site at the 3′ end after the translation stop codon was cloned into the pSI vector from Promega. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. At the chosen translation temperature of 24 °C, optimal expression was achieved using 0.5 μg of DNA, 3 units of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes, and 1 μl of [35S]methionine in a 25-μl reaction. Transcription and translation occurred in the same reaction over 120 min. Post-translational ubiquitination of CFTR and ΔF508 CFTR were measured following the addition of cycloheximide at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. For the immunoprecipitation of hsc70, aliquots of lysate were adjusted to 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 units/ml apyrase and agitated for 15 min at 4 °C. Sample composition was adjusted to 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS; samples were pre-cleared, and then 1 μg of anti-hsc70 antibody was added. Following exposure for 2 h at 4 °C, immune complexes were harvested with protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C, after which the beads were washed twice for 5 min each with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and once for 20 min in 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were eluted from the Sepharose beads using SDS sample buffer, and the CFTR content of the bead fraction and immuno-depleted supernatant was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Hence the proportions of wild type and ΔF508 CFTR bound to and free from molecular chaperones were assessed. CFTR was immunoprecipitated with a carboxyl-terminal-specific antibody under identical conditions but without the preliminary depletion of ATP from the reaction. hsp90 was immunoprecipitated in a buffer consisting of 50 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris·Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 0.25% Tween 20. Immune complexes on protein G-Sepharose beads were washed three times with 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Ubiquitin was immunoprecipitated under the same conditions as hsp90, with the exclusion of sodium molybdate from the reaction. Electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad mini protean II system. 8% polyacrylamide minigels were fixed in 25% isopropyl alcohol, 10% acetic acid and dried under vacuum. Dried gels were exposed to Molecular Dynamics phosphoscreens. Images were obtained using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, and densitometric analysis was undertaken using the ImageQuant software. Panel B of Fig.1 indicates that the CFTR produced in the RRL is a full-length protein, because it is immunoprecipitated by a carboxyl-terminal-specific antibody. Panel A shows the effect of the addition of microsomes to the translation mix. The molecular mass increase observed (5–6 kDa) is consistent with two N-linked glycosylation events occurring. There are two adjacent N-linked glycosylation sites in the fourth extracellular loop of CFTR (26Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 1Characterization of wild type and ΔF508 CFTR handling by the RRL. A, unglycosylated CFTR (U) is core-glycosylated in the presence of 3 units of microsomal membranes (CG). B, CFTR produced by the RRL is a full-length protein. Immunoprecipitation with a carboxyl terminus-specific antibody yields an immunodepleted supernatant (fraction S) and immunoprecipitated protein (fraction B). Most of the expressed protein has a complete carboxyl terminus because it is precipitated by this antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Following translation at 24 °C and addition of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, the incubation temperature was increased to 37 °C (time zero). Samples were taken and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig.2, panel A. Both wild type and ΔF508 CFTRs are ubiquitinated with indistinguishable kinetics. The observed half-lives of the core glycosylated bands (28.7 min for the wild type protein and 29.0 min for the mutant protein) are similar to those reported in cellular systems (7Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Panel B of Fig. 2 indicates that the high molecular mass material observed following incubation of CFTR is immunoprecipitated by an anti-ubiquitin antibody. The addition of multiple ubiquitin chains retards the progress of the CFTR in the gel such that it accumulates at the top. This does not necessarily reflect the true molecular mass of the polyubiquitinated protein; its mobility through the gel suggests a molecular mass of several hundred if not thousands of kilodaltons, which would be caused by the addition of many more ubiquitin chains than has previously been reported (27Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar,28Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high molecular mass could be due to the polyubiquitination at a single lysine residue or multiple lysine residues on the CFTR protein. The data cannot discount the possibility that ubiquitination caused aggregation of the CFTR protein. Other investigators examining the ubiquitination of CFTR in the cell and the RRL report an identical effect of ubiquitination on its electrophoretic mobility (11Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 12Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar,29Sato S. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7189-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). On continued incubation of core glycosylated wild type CFTR at 37 °C for several hours after synthesis is halted, there is no apparent diminution in the intensity of the polyubiquitinated CFTR band (panel C of Fig. 2). In the cell, this polyubiquitinated CFTR would be degraded by the proteasome (11Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 12Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). However, the RRL contains hemin (20 μm), which is required for optimal translation (30Gross M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 31: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hemin is also a potent inhibitor of proteasomal activity (31Haas A.L. Rose I.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); hence proteins expressed in the RRL can be ubiquitinated but not degraded by the proteasome. Introduction of core-glycosylated CFTR into hemin-free lysate restores proteasomal degradation of this high molecular mass polyubiquitinated form of the CFTR protein (32Lu Y. Xiong X. Helm A. Kimani K. Bragin A. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Following translation at 24 °C approximately 20% of wild type protein is stable with respect to ubiquitination when incubated at 30 °C, whereas all ΔF508 CFTR is ubiquitinated at this temperature (Fig. 3). This stable wild type protein may be analogous to the stable B form observed in cells (5Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 7Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It is not a result of the ability of the RRL to ubiquitinate substrates being compromised; when presented with a similar amount of mutant protein it is all ubiquitinated over the same time. The effect of 11 μg/ml geldanamycin on the stability of ΔF508 CFTR in the RRL at 30 °C is shown in Fig. 4. This concentration reliably gives full inhibition of hsp90 function in the RRL (17Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Co-translational addition of the drug (panel A) is without effect; however, when the drug is added post-translationally (panel B), approximately 25% of the mutant protein is stabilized with respect to ubiquitination. On treatment with geldanamycin there is no change in the rate of ubiquitination of the mutant protein; there is no significant difference between the amounts of protein remaining in the presence or absence of geldanamycin after up to 6 h of incubation. However, in the presence of geldanamycin little or no further ubiquitination occurs after 4 h of incubation at 30 °C, such that approximately 25% of the mutant protein persists on overnight incubation. Hence, 11 μg/ml geldanamycin has a stabilizing effect on ΔF508 CFTR, restoring its profile of degradation to a wild type-like appearance. The interaction of wild type and ΔF508 CFTR with the molecular chaperones hsp90 and hsc70 was assessed over the first 6 h of incubation at 30 °C. This was achieved through immunoprecipitation of the chaperone under conditions favoring substrate association (depletion of ATP in the case of hsc70; 10 mm sodium molybdate for hsp90). Hence the relative proportion of wild type and mutant protein bound to the chaperones was assessed. Geldanamycin treatment was without effect on the efficiency of immunoprecipitation of either hsc70 or hsp90 (data not shown). Panel A of Fig. 5 shows the interaction of hsp90 with wild type CFTR, ΔF508 CFTR alone, and ΔF508 CFTR in the presence of 11 μg/ml geldanamycin. Panel B shows the interactions of the same three groups with hsc70. Note that whereas association of wild type protein with these chaperones is transient, ΔF508 CFTR forms a long lasting complex with hsc70 (as previously reported (9Yang Y. Janich S. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar)) and hsp90. Geldanamycin rapidly prevents the association of hsp90 with ΔF508 CFTR and gradually reduces binding of hsc70 over a 4-h period. It is noteworthy that the loss of binding of hsc70 to both wild type and ΔF508 CFTR coincides with the cessation of ubiquitination of these proteins. In this study, a cell-free system has been described that reproduces the differences between wild type and ΔF508 CFTR observed in the cell. Following translation, 20% of wild type protein is stable with respect to ubiquitination at 30 °C, but all ΔF508 CFTR is ubiquitinated. The stable wild type protein observed may be analogous to the stable B form described in cells (5Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 7Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This is addressed below. Whatever the nature of this stable form of the wild type protein, a clear difference is observed between the handling of this and the mutant protein, and pharmacological correction of this difference in the RRL such that mutant protein is stable over an overnight incubation at 30 °C may be sufficient to correct the ΔF508 trafficking defect in the intact cell. The RRL with microsomal membranes added has been presumed to essentially provide cytosolic and ER compartments in which folding and degradation events are unaltered from the way in which they proceed in the intact cell. However, the failure of the lysate to support formation of stable B CFTR at 37 °C casts doubt on such an assumption and calls into question the validity of using the RRL as a model for the cell at this temperature (29Sato S. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7189-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The fact that stable B CFTR may be achieved at 30 °C goes some way to reaffirming that the lysate is indeed a relevant cellular model. Little is known about the properties of the stable B form of the protein. Its well identified characteristics are its lack of susceptibility to ubiquitination in the cell and its ability to traffic from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Whereas the former property has been established in the RRL, the latter cannot be tested here because trafficking out of the ER is not possible in this system. The failure of ΔF508 CFTR to achieve this state is further evidence that the observed cellular difference between wild type and ΔF508 CFTR is reproduced here; the specific lesion of ΔF508 CFTR is the conversion from unstable to stable band B. It is extremely unlikely that the RRL may be unable to ubiquitinate wild type but not ΔF508 CFTR as a result of being compromised metabolically. Both proteins are synthesized from identical plasmids, save for the presence of the mutation, and similar (very small) quantities of protein are presented to the lysate for ubiquitination. It is therefore unlikely that the lysate could be competent to fully ubiquitinate one but not the other unless the wild type protein is no longer a substrate for ubiquitination. The replication of the cellular behavior of nascent wild type and ΔF508 CFTR in the RRL at 30 °C validates the use of this system to study events leading to the formation of stable B protein. Given that the RRL supports formation of stable B CFTR at 30 °C, an important question must be why it does so at this temperature but not at higher ones. The recommended (and most commonly used) temperature at which the RRL is operated is 30 °C. It is our experience that translation of other proteins in the RRL at higher temperatures produces little full-length protein; the RRL does not operate efficiently at 37 °C. The differences between the lysate at 37 °C and 30 °C cannot be readily identified. It may be that the lower temperature allows some protein complex such as the foldosome (16Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to assemble and operate efficiently where it cannot at 37 °C. It is also possible that at 30 °C some amount of ordering may be possible in the lysate, the added microsomal membranes, the molecular chaperone system, or the polypeptide chain of CFTR that leads to stable B being favored. In the cell, such order may be imposed by the cytoskeleton. An important prediction from the observation that stable B CFTR can be formed in the RRL is that neither an intact cytoskeleton nor membrane traffic from the ER is required to support formation of stable B in the cell. The fact that the RRL supports formation of stable B wild type CFTR means the effects of drugs on formation of stable B ΔF508 CFTR may be assessed. Any drug showing positive effects may facilitate the release of the mutant protein from its ER processing block in vivo. The effect of geldanamycin on ΔF508 CFTR is described in Fig. 4. This drug supports production of stable B ΔF508 CFTR in the RRL. Stabilization is only observed on post-translational addition of the drug. If binding of hsp90 to the mutant protein were simply post-translational, then geldanamycin would have an identical effect on ΔF508 CFTR whether it was present throughout translation or after it was complete. That geldanamycin is without effect on ΔF508 CFTR stability if present co-translationally implies that co-translational binding of the chaperone is required if stable B is to be achieved. Hence, the following model is put forward. Co-translational binding of ΔF508 CFTR by hsp90 mediates the formation of stable B protein; post-translational binding is involved with ubiquitination of the protein. In the cell, this model predicts that only protein already translated upon addition of geldanamycin will be stabilized with respect to ubiquitination. However, the role of hsp90 cannot be considered alone. Blockage of hsc70 binding by treatment with an hsp90 binding agent indicates that the functions of these two proteins are linked. The effect of geldanamycin on hsc70 binding is delayed, but its effect on hsp90 binding is immediate. This delay perhaps implies that whereas the effect of this hsp90 binding agent in preventing the association of the chaperone with its substrate is mediated directly, its effect on hsc70 interactions with proteins is indirect. It also suggests that the effect of geldanamycin on hsc70 binding to ΔF508 CFTR is not a result of an interaction between geldanamycin and hsc70; such an effect would be immediate. Association of hsc70 with substrate may rely on an interaction with hsp90 and other members of the foldosome complex. Dissociation of this complex following inhibition of hsp90 function may take time, such that hsc70 interactions with ΔF508 CFTR are still observed after some hours of exposure to the drug. Whatever the mechanism by which these events occur, important conclusions to be drawn are that hsp90 and hsc70 operate together in the RRL (in agreement with other results (33Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)) and that hsp90 and hsc70 operate cooperatively in the RRL (as suggested in Ref. 34Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9493-9499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The findings of Loo et al. (10Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) must be considered in respect of the discussion above. These authors describe a destabilization of wild type CFTR in a cellular system as a result of geldanamycin treatment blocking hsp90 function. Geldanamycin prevents the formation of stable B CFTR and targets the protein for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Blocking hsp90 interactions with wild type CFTR increases its association with hsc70 in this system. This apparently contradicts the results obtained in this study and the model described above. However, the post-translational effect of geldanamycin on ΔF508 CFTR in the RRL is unlikely to be observed in a cellular system because almost all protein examined in such a system will be translated in the presence of the drug. This may explain many of the differences observed between this study and previous work, in which authors usually observe a destabilization of an hsp90 substrate by treatment with geldanamycin (for example, Refs. 18Whitesell L.

It is perhaps an unsurprising result that blocking molecular chaperone interactions with proteins emerging from the ribosome prevents them from following the correct folding pathway. Using the methods of Loo et al. (10Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), it would be impossible to detect the small amount of CFTR present in the ER when the drug is applied to the cells that would escape ubiquitination, because geldanamycin is added before the [35S]methionine pulse. As a result, all labeled protein is translated in the presence of the drug, and all observations regarding the effect of geldanamycin on CFTR are made on a protein that has been translated in the presence of geldanamycin. The advantage of the RRL as the model system is that the separation of co- and post-translational events is made easy. According to our model, translation of wild type or ΔF508 CFTR in the absence of hsp90 will indeed prevent the formation of stable B protein (Fig. 4, panel A). It is only post-translational disruption of the ΔF508 CFTR·hsp90 complex that rescues the protein from ubiquitination (Fig. 4, panel B). Therefore, the results in Ref. 10Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar do not contradict our model and indeed in some respects confirm the observations made in this study. Specifically, the authors also observe that hsp90 is involved in the biogenesis of CFTR in another in vitro system. According to Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, ubiquitination of wild type and ΔF508 CFTR in the RRL only occurs when they are interacting with hsc70. Although no causal link has been established between hsc70 and ubiquitination of CFTR by this work, others have found that hsc70 is required for ubiquitination of certain protein substrates (38Sawa T. Imamura T. Haruta T. Sasaoka T. Ishiki M. Takata Y. Takada Y. Morioka H. Ishihara H. Usui I. Kobayashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 39Bercovich B. Stancovski I. Mayer A. Blumenfeld N. Laszlo A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar); so our results do suggest a role for hsc70 in mediating the ubiquitination of CFTRin vitro. Release of wild type CFTR from hsc70 coincides with its stabilization in the RRL, and the same result is seen for ΔF508 CFTR when interactions with hsc70 are prevented with geldanamycin. Hence, although the link between hsc70 binding and ubiquitination has not been definitively established, it is clear that this chaperone cannot simply be regarded as a protein folder. Nor indeed can hsp90, because it is this protein whose targeting has affected the ubiquitination of ΔF508 CFTR in this system. hsc70 should be regarded as an agent that promotes protein folding and degradation equally. This is entirely in line with its function in protein quality control. The dual functions of determining the progress toward the folded state of a protein and presenting misfolded proteins to the degradation apparatus of the cell must co-exist for any protein to effectively carry out quality control in the cell. hsc70 appears to fulfil both these functions in the case of controlling the folding of wild type and ΔF508 CFTR. It is important to appreciate that our model cannot be applied in all situations. When geldanamycin is present co-translationally, ΔF508 CFTR is not stabilized with respect to ubiquitination. According to the model, preventing hsp90 interactions with the protein should prevent ubiquitination of the protein in the RRL. This does not occur probably because the perturbations to the folding pathway are so great when co-translational chaperone binding is prevented that ubiquitination will occur regardless. Whether this effect is mediated by enhanced hsc70 binding to the misfolded protein in some hsp90-independent function (as observed in Ref. 10Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) will not be speculated upon. However it is achieved, ubiquitination of all ΔF508 CFTR synthesized in the presence of geldanamycin does occur. The results presented must be considered alongside the observed correction of ΔF508 CFTR trafficking on treatment of cells with the hsc70 binding agent deoxyspergualin (41Jiang C. Fang S.L. Xiao Y.F. O'Connor S.P. Nadler S.G. Lee D.W. Jefferson D.M. Kaplan J.M. Smith A.E. Cheng S.H. Am. J. Physiol. (Cell Physiol. ). 1998; 275: C171-C178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the data presented here, such a result is perhaps unsurprising. Blockage of binding of the major agent involved in mediating the ubiquitination of ΔF508 CFTR restores its traffic to the plasma membrane. The identification of the ATP binding site on hsp90 as the site of interaction of geldanamycin (24Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that geldanamycin might also bind directly to CFTR at the first or second ATP binding fold. The first ATP binding fold is the site of ΔF508, and it could be argued that geldanamycin is able to stabilize ΔF508 CFTR through binding at the site of the mutation. We do not favor such an explanation, because there is no evidence that geldanamycin is specific for any ATP binding sites other than that on hsp90. Moreover, this cannot explain the requirement that geldanamycin be added post-translationally for its stabilizing effect to be observed in the RRL. In summary, the molecular chaperones hsc70 and hsp90 have a role in both the folding and ubiquitination of wild type and ΔF508 CFTR. During translation, these chaperones assist the formation of correctly folded protein. Following cessation of translation, hsc70 and hsp90 appear to move into “ubiquitination mode”; blocking the binding of hsp90 and hsc70 to ΔF508 CFTR rescues the protein from ubiquitination. However, the use of chaperone binding drugs in the treatment of cystic fibrosis is unfeasible. Disruption of chaperone function by systemic administration of a drug such as geldanamycin has profound effects throughout an organism (42Supko J.G. Hickman R.L. Grever M.R. Malspeis L. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1995; 36: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 43Schulte T.W. Neckers L.M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Any cystic fibrosis treatment must carry relatively few side effects, because a patient must use such a therapy throughout life. Therefore, disruption of chaperone interactions with nascent ΔF508 CFTR in vivomust be achieved through means other than targeting the molecular chaperones themselves, unless drugs can be targeted directly to epithelia. We thank Dr. Luke Whitesell for preliminary discussions and Dr. David Newman for providing geldanamycin."

We show that interleukin 2 (IL-2), an important stimulator of T cell growth, preferentially binds to collagen types I, III, and VI and to a lesser degree to collagen types II, IV, and V, immobilized on polystyrene or nitrocellulose. These interactions are inhibited by denatured, single collagen chains or a subset of their cyanogen bromide peptides in a dose-dependent manner. Cross-inhibition experiments and ligand blotting of collagen-derived peptides point to a limited set of collagenous consensus sequences mediating the binding of IL-2. This interaction is saturable, with dissociation constants of ∼10−8m, and estimated molar ratios of 4–6 molecules of IL-2 bound to one molecule of triple helical collagen. Furthermore, collagen-bound IL-2 stimulates proliferation of mouse lymphocytes. We conclude that its specific binding to the abundant interstitial collagens leads to a spatial pattern of bioavailable IL-2 which is dictated by the local organization of the collagenous extracellular matrix. This interaction may contribute to the particular phenotype of stromal lymphocytes and could be exploited for devising collagenous peptide analogues that modulate IL-2 bioactivity.

In the present study we demonstrate that interleukin 2 (IL-2) which is one of the most important stimulators and modulators of T cell activation, playing a major role in the pathophysiology of various immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (30Panayi G.S. Rheumatology. 1999; 38 Suppl. 2: 8-10PubMed Google Scholar), multiple sclerosis (31Martino G. Grohovaz F. Brambilla E. Codazzi F. Consiglio A. Clementi E. Filippi M. Comi G. Grimaldi L.M. Ann.

This binding preserves the biological activity of IL-2 and involves primary collagenous consensus sequences. Human recombinant IL-2 was purchased from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany, catalog number 50442), Roche Molecular Biochemicals (catalog number 1147528), and from Eurocetus (Frankfurt, Germany (ProleukinTM)). All other reagents were either from Merck or Sigma and were the highest purity available. Polystyrene microtiter plates (Immulon 2, Removawells) were from Dynatech (Hamburg, Germany). Native type I, III, IV, V, and VI collagens were isolated from human placenta or skin, and type II collagen was purified from human articular cartilage.

Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptides were prepared by digestion with CNBr by solubilizing 2 mg of single collagen chains in 1 ml of 70% formic acid at room temperature, flushing the tube 10 min with nitrogen, and adding 2 mg of CNBr, followed by a 4-h incubation at 37 °C and by lyophilization (36Matsudaira P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These peptides were purified using gel filtration and ion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography. Coating of microtiter plates and calculation of coating efficiencies were performed as described before (28Somasundaram R. Schuppan D. J. Biol.

Briefly, native collagens and collagen chains were immobilized on polystyrene microtiter wells at concentrations of 2–4 μg/100 μl/well for binding studies, and at 50 ng/200 μl/well for inhibition experiments. Purified collagen α1(I)-derived cyanogen bromide peptides were coated at 1 μg/100 μl/well. Immobilization was done in 50 mmammonium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Unspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate), for 1 h at 4 °C. Coating efficiencies for 2 μg/well of native collagens and collagen chains ranged between 21 and 48% (28Somasundaram R. Schuppan D. J. Biol.

IL-2 was radiolabeled with the 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.125I-Labeled IL-2 was separated from free iodine by a Sepharose G-25 column (PD 10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS, containing 0.05% Tween 20 as described (28Somasundaram R.

Precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (10% v/v) in the presence of 200 μg of bovine serum albumin/200 μl, usually yielded 90–96% of protein-bound radioactivity. Purity of radiolabeled IL-2 was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For binding studies 1–2 ng of 125I-IL-2 in 100 μl of PBS, 0.05% Tween was added to the collagen-coated wells incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and finally, after three washes in binding buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), radioactivity bound to the collagen-coated wells was measured in a γ-counter (Berthold, Bad Wildbach, Germany). For ligand blots, 2 μg of CNBr peptides from single collagen chains α1(I), α2(I), and α1(III), and pepsin-resistant triple helical fragments of collagen types IV and VI were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked with PBS, 0.3% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C, washed three times in binding buffer, and incubated with ∼50 ng of 125I-IL-2 diluted in 20 ml of binding buffer (50,000 cpm/ml) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with binding buffer before air-drying and autoradiography. Since solubilized triple helical, native collagen types I, III, V, and VI may rapidly form fibrils in neutral buffers, reproducible results from inhibition experiments were only obtained by using single chains from these collagens, either after heat denaturation or after reduction and alkylation. Furthermore, CNBr peptides of collagen chains α1(I) were used for inhibition experiments. 1–2 ng of 125I-IL-2 and sequential dilutions of collagen chains or collagen α1(I)-CNBr peptides were preincubated in a total volume of 350 μl for 2 h at room temperature in detergent-blocked polypropylene tubes. 100 μl of the mixture was then added in triplicate to the collagen-precoated microtiter wells. After a further 2 h of incubation and three washes with binding buffer, bound activity was measured as described above. For saturation binding studies increasing amounts of unlabeled IL-2 (0–10 μg) were added to 2 ng (∼50,000 cpm) of the labeled cytokine in a final volume of 100 μl of binding buffer and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in microtiter wells that were precoated with 200 ng of native triple helical collagens or single collagen chains. To exclude different binding affinities of radiolabeled versus unlabeled IL-2, binding experiments were also performed by using the radiolabeled IL-2 up to a concentration of 20 ng (∼500,000 cpm) per well. The resultant binding curves showed a superimposable pattern when compared with those obtained with 2 ng of radiolabeled IL-2 and increasing amounts of unlabeled cytokine (data not shown). To determine biological activity of collagen-bound IL-2, a modified IL-2 bioassay was used (37Bottomly K. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 6.3.1-6.3.6Google Scholar). Briefly, a mouse T-lymphocyte cell line (CTLL-2, ATCC TIB 214) was cultured in 80-cm2 flasks containing RPMI 1640, glutamine (2 mm), mercaptoethanol (50 μm), IL-2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 0.05 units/ml), supplemented with penicillin (107 units/liter), streptomycin (10 mg/liter), and 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) under standardized conditions (37 °C, 8% CO2) in a humidified atmosphere. Collagen I was coated on microtiter wells at a concentration of 2 μg/100 μl/well (0.3 cm2) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with polyvinyl alcohol (1 mg/ml) in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h followed by extensive washing with PBS/Tween. IL-2 in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 was added at increasing concentrations to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After 2 h unbound IL-2 was removed by washing with PBS/Tween, followed by three washes with PBS. 100 μl of the IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells in the logarithmic growth phase (200,000 cells/ml), were plated in IL-2-deficient medium on uncoated (control) or collagen-coated wells that had been preincubated with different concentrations of IL-2. In parallel, IL-2 added to the CTLL-2 cells served as a positive control. Cells were then cultured for 20 h, and DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation during the last 4 h. Binding data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Dissociation constants and the number of binding sites obtained by saturation experiments were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard (28Somasundaram R. Schuppan D. J. Biol.

Native triple helical collagen types I–VI and heat-denatured or reduced and alkylated single chain collagen types I, III, IV, and VI bound between 22 and 34% (for native collagens) and 18–29% (for denatured collagens) of radiolabeled IL-2 (1–2 ng) when immobilized on polystyrene microtiter wells (Fig. 1). Furthermore, collagens with the decreasing order, type I > III > VI > their respective constituent chains, were shown to be the best ligands. Unspecific binding of radiolabeled IL-2 to blocked polystyrene wells was around 6%. Furthermore, polystyrene-immobilized α1(I)-derived CNBr peptides were shown to bind between 24 and 36% (order CB8 = CB6 > CB7) of the added 125I-IL-2, compared with only 7% binding to α1(I)CB3 and 3% binding to uncoated control wells (Fig. 2).Figure 1IL-2 binds to immobilized native triple helical collagens and to single collagen chains. Native triple helical collagen (C) types I–VI and single collagen chains of collagen types III, IV and VI after reduction and alkylation (r/a), as well as chains α1(I) and α2(I) were immobilized on polystyrene microtiter wells at 2 or 4 μg/100 μl for native collagens or collagen chains, respectively, followed by incubation with 1–2 ng (0.0645 to 0.129 nmol) of radiolabeled IL-2 (molecular mass 15.5 kDa).

When bound radioactivity was eluted by boiling reducing SDS-gel sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, only intact IL-2 was identified (data not shown). In addition to the results of the polystyrene assay, binding of IL-2 to the collagen chains could also be demonstrated by ligand blot experiments. Triple helical collagens (after denaturation), single collagen chains, and their cyanogen bromide peptides, once transferred to nitrocellulose after SDS-PAGE, bound radiolabeled IL-2 as shown by autoradiography. In accordance with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent-type assay, IL-2 bound only to some of the cyanogen bromide peptides, although protein staining demonstrated a comparable transfer of all collagen chains and cyanogen bromide peptides to nitrocellulose (Fig. 3). Due to their characteristic molecular weight, these cyanogen bromide fragments could be identified as α1(I)CB6 (20 kDa) and α1(I)CB8 (28 kDa), whereas binding was weaker for α1(I)CB7 (30 kDa) and an uncleaved dimeric peptide of α1(I) (52 kDa). Additional IL-2-binding peptides were CB3 or CB5 (both 31 kDa) and the dimeric uncleaved CB3-5 (62 kDa) of the α2(I) chain, α1(III)CB9 (migrating as a trimer of 72 kDa before and a monomer of 24 kDa after reduction), as well as pepsin-resistant fragments of the α2 chain of collagen type IV (120, 60 and 50 kDa) and of the three α-chains of collagen type VI (Fig. 3). Incubation of IL-2 with the constituent chains of collagen type I, namely α1 and α2, with native collagen types III and IV, previously immobilized at 50 ng/200 μl/well, in the presence of increasing amounts of solubilized collagen chains or their CNBr peptides resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the IL-2-collagen interaction. Different collagen chains were able to inhibit IL-2 binding to their respective homotypic but also heterotypic immobilized collagens (Fig. 4), demonstrating the potential of collagen chains for cross-inhibition. The inhibition varied slightly when different combinations of soluble collagen chains and collagenous substrates were used. As an example, 10 μg/ml of the reduced and alkylated chains of type VI collagen inhibited the binding of IL-2 to the immobilized homotypic chains and to reduced and alkylated collagen type III up to 90%, whereas they blocked binding of IL-2 to the immobilized α1 or α2 chains of collagen type I only by 70% (Fig. 4 A). Results with the α1 chain of collagen type I as inhibitor were similar (Fig. 4 B). To define further the potential binding sites on the α1 chain of collagen type I, CNBr peptides were used as inhibitors (Fig. 4 C). Clearly, CB6 and to a lower extent CB8, but not CB7 or CB3, were able to inhibit IL-2 binding to the immobilized α1(I) chain. Thus, the inhibition experiments with single collagen chains and CNBr peptides indicate a shared or a similar binding site for IL-2 on different collagen chains. Furthermore, this binding site appears to be a collagenous primary structure which for α1(I) is restricted to peptides α1(I)CB6 and α1(I)CB8. When increasing amounts of unlabeled IL-2 were incubated with a constant amount of 125I-IL-2 (∼1 ng/well), binding to immobilized collagens was saturable (see Fig. 5 for collagen type III and the α1(I) chain). Saturation was reached between 150 and 250 ng of IL-2/100 μl on 200 ng/well of immobilized collagen types I and III and on 400 ng/well of the immobilized α1(I) chain. By taking into account the coating efficiencies of the respective immobilized collagens (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the amount of IL-2 needed to reach saturation, Scatchard analysis (38Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17789) Google Scholar) yielded binding sites of comparable affinity on the tested collagens, with dissociation constants (Kd) of ∼10−8 mol/l. Based on these data, 1 mol of immobilized collagen type I and III and 1 mol of the α1(I) chain were estimated to bind approximately 6, 4, and 1 mol of IL-2, respectively. IL-2 bound to collagen type I stimulated DNA synthesis of a mouse T-lymphocyte cell line (CTLL-2 cells), as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, whereas no DNA synthesis was observed with comparable amounts of IL-2 bound to polystyrene alone (Fig. 6). The collagen-bound IL-2 was ∼5-fold less biologically active than “free” IL-2 (Fig. 6). We demonstrated that IL-2 can bind to immobilized collagen types I–VI in vitro. Preferential binding was observed to the most abundant fibrillar collagen types I and III. Binding was saturable and yielded dissociation constants of ∼10−8m, a range similar to that found for many other protein-protein interactions, particularly among molecules of the ECM (39Moser T.L. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18917-18923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and comparable to that described for the interaction of PDGF and HGF with collagens (28Somasundaram R. Schuppan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26884-26891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Schuppan D. Schmid M. Somasundaram R. Ackermann R. Ruehl M. Nakamura T. Riecken E.O. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The interaction of IL-2 with native as well as denatured collagens could be inhibited by single collagen chains, and cross-inhibition experiments suggested one or more collagenous consensus binding sites for IL-2. That indeed a limited number of collagenous consensus sequences may be involved is further supported by the results of ligand blots and inhibition experiments performed with smaller collagen peptides, derived from digestion with cyanogen bromide or pepsin. These experiments show only few of the peptides, e.g. α1(I)CB6 and α1(III)CB9 that bind radiolabeled IL-2 with high affinity, whereas other peptides of similar size, such as α1(I)CB7 and α1(III)CB8, are not (or minimally) reactive in ligand blots and inhibition experiments (Figs. 3 and 4). The peptides that interact with IL-2 are those that also bind the growth factors PDGF and HGF, albeit with different preferences (as judged by the inhibitory potential or the relative intensities of the autoradiographic bands) (28Somasundaram R. Schuppan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26884-26891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Schuppan D. Schmid M. Somasundaram R. Ackermann R. Ruehl M. Nakamura T. Riecken E.O. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), indicating overlapping binding sites on collagens for IL-2, PDGF, and HGF. We could indeed show cross-competition among the three growth factors for the studied collagen types and collagen chains (data not shown). As discussed before (28Somasundaram R. Schuppan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26884-26891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Schuppan D. Schmid M. Somasundaram R. Ackermann R. Ruehl M. Nakamura T. Riecken E.O. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), a disadvantage of solid phase assays is the potential of epitope masking by interaction of the collagens with the polystyrene matrix. Thus we cannot exclude that we underestimated the binding sites and obtained a lower calculated number of IL-2 molecules bound to single chain compared with triple helical collagen. A necessary precondition for binding experiments is the purity of the used ligands, since minimal contamination of collagens with other ECM components, e.g. glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans, can invalidate the results. Such interference could be excluded, since the collagens that were used for these binding experiments had been subjected to rigorous purification procedures. Furthermore, pretreatment with several enzymes excluded contaminating glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, or glycoproteins as discussed elsewhere (28Somasundaram R. Schuppan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26884-26891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Schuppan D. Schmid M. Somasundaram R. Ackermann R. Ruehl M. Nakamura T. Riecken E.O. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since an interaction of IL-2 with glycosaminoglycans, e.g. heparin, was described in a single study (9Ramsden L. Rider C.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3027-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), inhibition experiments with up to 250-fold molar excess of heparin (relative to immobilized collagen) were performed, which did not show inhibition of IL-2 binding to collagen types I, III, or IV (data not shown). IL-2, one of the best studied cytokines, plays a central role in inflammation. It is produced by activated T cells and acts in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner on T, B, and natural killer cells. IL-2 signaling promotes T cell survival by up-regulation of Bcl-2 but can also induce T cell tolerance via elimination of autoreactive T cells through IL-2 -induced apoptosis (40Van Parijs L. Refaeli Y. Lord J.D. Nelson B.H. Abbas A.K. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1999; 11: 281-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). IL-2 exerts this effect through a specific and high affinity trimeric receptor complex (Kd of 10−11m), consisting of an α-, a β-, and a γ-subunit, of which the α- and β-subunits and the heterodimers (α/γ and β/γ) can bind IL-2 independently, but with lower affinity (Kd of 10−7, 10−8, and 10−9, respectively) (41Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 25-40PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the pluripotent effects of IL-2 in immune regulation, our finding of a specific interaction of IL-2 with collagens and predominantly collagen types I, III, and VI, which represent the most abundant components of normal and fibrotic extracellular matrices, should have biological significance. Thus, these collagens could modulate the local availability and activity of this cytokine by serving as low affinity stores for IL-2, which may be picked up by invading T cells that carry the high affinity receptor. This would implicate that the pattern of ECM determines, at least in part, the activation of resident or invading lymphocytes by engaging their integrin receptors (43Roberts A.I. Brolin R.E. Ebert E.C. Immunology. 1999; 97: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as well as by presenting IL-2. This hypothesis is supported by our cell culture experiments in which proliferation of the IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-2 was stimulated when seeded on immobilized collagens preincubated with IL-2 (Fig. 6). Although collagen-bound IL-2, compared with equimolar doses of soluble IL-2, is less biologically active in our in vitro system, the bioavailability of collagen-bound IL-2 in vivo may be augmented by matrix degradation, as occurs during inflammation and wound repair (44Schuppan D. Hahn E.G. Gut. 2000; 47: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Packard B.Z. Mostowski H.S. Komoriya A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 46Kafienah W. Buttle D.J. Burnett D. Hollander A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this line collagens do not merely serve as a store for IL-2 but simultaneously can up-regulate the IL-2 receptor via engagement of integrins, since collagens as well as fibronectin were shown to stimulate expression of IL-2 receptor p55 and p75 mRNA in murine lymphocytic M4 T cells, to a level comparable to that induced by IL-2 itself (47Tschoetschel U. Schwing J. Frosch S. Schmitt E. Schuppan D. Reske-Kunz A.B. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is well established that integrin and growth factor receptor cross-talk potentiates the mitogenic response in various cell types, including lymphocytes (48Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). This was shown for prolonged lymphocyte spreading, which is integrin-dependent, resulting in the up-regulation of the mitogen cytokine IL-2 and in S phase entry (49Geginat J. Bossi G. Bender J.R. Pardi R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5085-5093PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, our study demonstrates a specific binding of IL-2 to interstitial collagens, which may be exploited to modulate the local availability and activity of this cytokine in wound repair and inflammation. Since binding of IL-2 to collagens is mediated by cross-inhibitory consensus sequences, competitive collagenous peptides, their nonpeptidic analogues, or the design of collagenous peptide carriers for IL-2, e.g. for use in local cancer therapy, may be envisaged."
https://openalex.org/W2143134890,"Type I signal peptidase (SPase I) catalyzes the cleavage of the amino-terminal signal sequences from preproteins destined for cell export. Preproteins contain a signal sequence with a positively charged n-region, a hydrophobic h-region, and a neutral but polar c-region. Despite having no distinct consensus sequence other than a commonly found c-region “Ala-X-Ala” motif preceding the cleavage site, signal sequences are recognized by SPase I with high fidelity. Remarkably, other potential Ala-X-Ala sites are not cleaved within the preprotein. One hypothesis is that the source of this fidelity is due to the anchoring of both the SPase I enzyme (by way of its transmembrane segment) and the preprotein substrate (by the h-region in the signal sequence) in the membrane. This limits the enzyme-substrate interactions such that cleavage occurs at only one site. In this work we have, for the first time, successfully isolated Bacillus subtilis type I signal peptidase (SipS) and a truncated version lacking the transmembrane domain (SipS-P2). With purified full-length as well as truncated constructs of both B. subtilis andEscherichia coli (Lep) SPase I, in vitrospecificity studies indicate that the transmembrane domains of either enzyme are not important determinants of in vitro cleavage fidelity, since enzyme constructs lacking them reveal no alternate site processing of pro-OmpA nuclease A substrate. In addition, experiments with mutant pro-OmpA nuclease A substrate constructs indicate that the h-region of the signal peptide is also not critical for substrate specificity. In contrast, certain mutants in the c-region of the signal peptide result in alternate site cleavage by both Lep and SipS enzymes.

Cleavage of these signal peptides is accomplished by type I signal peptidases (SPase I).1 Since these enzymes are essential for the viability of bacteria (1Date T. J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5712-5718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type I signal peptidases belong to a class of serine proteases that appear to utilize a serine/lysine dyad mechanism rather than the serine/histidine/aspartic acid catalytic triad seen in the more classical serine proteases (5Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 28-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The most thoroughly studied type I signal peptidase is the Gram-negative Escherichia colisignal peptidase (or leader peptidase (Lep)) (6Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Unlike E. coli, which contains only one chromosomal copy of Lep, the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis contains five chromosomal (SipS, SipT, SipU, SipV, and SipW) and two plasmid-encoded type I signal peptidases (SipP (pTA1015) and SipP (pTA1040) (7Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)). The B. subtilis SPases SipS, SipT, SipU, and SipV, which maintain the sequence similarity to the E. coli paralog, are much smaller in size, contain only one transmembrane anchor instead of two, and have a much smaller predicted β-sheet domain II than the E. coli enzyme (8Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Five of the 30 conserved residues within signal peptidase of B. subtilis (SipS; 21 kDa, 184 amino acids) have been found to be critical for enzyme function (9van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanpera J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Arg84 and Asp146 appear to be conformational determinants, while Ser43, Lys83, and Asp153 are required for activity. Ser43 is the putative nucleophile, while Lys83 is believed to act as the general base in the catalytic mechanism of SipS. Except for residues involved in catalysis, there has been little work on the in vitro characteristics of purified SPases other than E. coli Lep. We report in this study the in vitro characterization of the Gram-positive B. subtilistype I SPase, SipS, and compare its substrate specificity with Gram-negative E. coli type I SPase, Lep. We find that some mutated variants of PONA are better substrates with SipS, whereas these same mutant preprotein substrates are poorer substrates for E. coli Lep. In addition, we find that transmembrane anchoring of the SPase I enzyme is not essential for the recognition of the correct “Ala-X-Ala” cleavage site in the PONA substrate. Using wild type and mutated variants of PONA, we find that truncated constructs of E. coli Lep or B. subtilis SipS are still able to maintain substrate specificity and cleave at the proper cleavage site. With respect to the signal sequence of the preprotein substrate PONA, our in vitro specificity studies also show that the h-region is not important for cleavage accuracy. In contrast to the effects of some mutations in the c-region of the signal peptide, no h-region changes resulted in altered cleavage site specificity for either the E. coli or B. subtilis enzymes. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthesized by the DNA core facility of the Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University or were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, ampicillin, and other chemical reagents were purchased from Fisher. Enzymes for recombinant DNA methods were purchased from Promega unless stated otherwise. The SipS gene from theB. subtilis genome was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The strain (8G5sipS; trpC2 try his nic ura met ada sipS) was obtained from the Ohio State University stock. Polymerase chain reaction was run for 30 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Cetus thermal cycler with the sense primer (ACT GGA GGA GAT ATCATC AAA TCA GAA AAT GTT) and an antisense primer (GGA AGC TGC TGG ATC CTA ATT TGT TTT GCG CAT for the SipS WT. The underlined sequences are the EcoRV and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The sense primer for the SipS-P2 construct was CTT GCT TTG GAT ATC CGC AAC TTT ATT TTT. The polymerase chain reaction fragments were cut with EcoRV and BamHI and then ligated in frame into the XmnI and BamHI restriction sites of the pMAL-c2 expression vector (New England Biolabs) containing the inducible Ptac promoter. Ligations were transformed into E. coli host TB1, araΔ(lac proAB) rpsL (φ80 lacZΔM15) hsdR. DNA manipulations were performed as described by Maniatis et al. (11Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The cloning procedures used T4 DNA ligase and restriction enzymes from Life Technologies, Inc. E. coli (TB1) containing the pMAL-c2 vector with the SipS gene was grown in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Each liter of medium was inoculated with 10 ml of the overnight cell culture. The cells were grown at 37 °C to a cell density A600 = 0.7, at which time isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce the expression of the fusion protein. The cells were allowed to grow for an additional 4 h and then harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g for 5 min, 4 °C). The cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.0 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 30 mm NaCl, 0.07% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.0) and then lysed by passing them five times through a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged (27,000 × g for 30 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was diluted 1:5 with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then applied to an amylose resin affinity column (New England Biolabs, 2.5 × 10 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was then washed with two column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The fusion protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm maltose. Fractions were collected and analyzed for protein by the Bradford method (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). MBP-SipS-P2 fusion protein was further purified on a Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite column (1.5 × 10 cm) using a gradient elution scheme of 10–500 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The fusion proteins were dialyzed extensively (2 × 9 liters) against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then stored frozen at −70 °C. The MBP-SipS WT fusion protein construct contains a factor Xa cleavage site located immediately prior to the amino terminus of the SipS protein. Our preliminary studies indicated that factor Xa cleaves the MBP-SipS WT fusion very slowly (approximately only 50% cleavage in 2–3 days at room temperature). Since the factor Xa cleavage site ended with an arginine, we developed a limited trypsin (Sigma) digest procedure to cleave the MBP-SipS fusions using 0.1% weight of trypsin/weight of fusion for 1 h (13Patterson W.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17020-17024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After an optimal digestion time (∼20–60 min), as determined individually from small scale experiments of each purification, the trypsin activity was inhibited using phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and trypsin inhibitor bound to agarose beads (Sigma). The MBP-SipS-P2 fusion protein was cleaved using factor Xa. The fusion protein was incubated at room temperature for 18 h using 2.2 μg of factor Xa/mg of MBP-SipS-P2 fusion in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2. The factor Xa cleavage reaction was stopped by the addition of 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone dihydrochloride from Calbiochem. The SipS (WT) enzyme was separated from the cleaved MBP by applying the protein to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FF Q Sepharose anion exchange column (1.5 × 5 cm), which was equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. SipS was then eluted with a 100–700 mmNaCl gradient. Fractions containing pure SipS protein were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then stored at −70 °C. The SipS-P2 protein was separated from the cleaved MBP by a Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite column (1.5 × 10 cm) using a gradient of 10–500 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. WT (Lep) and truncated (Δ2–75) E. coli type I signal peptidase enzymes were purified as described previously (14Klenotic P.A. Carlos J.L. Samuelson J.C. Schuenemann T.A. Tschantz W.R. Paetzel M.

One μg of SipS WT was loaded onto an isoelectric focusing gel using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Phast Gel system, Phast gel 3–9 media, and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech broad range pI standards (0.2 μg of standard was applied to the gel). The gel was visualized by Phast Gel Blue R Coomassie staining. Purified SipS, SipS-P2, and substrate PONA masses were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a MicroMass VG Quattro II mass spectrometer and a Finnigan LC Q classic ion trap mass spectrometer. The coding sequence for the pro-OmpA nuclease A substrate, a hybrid of the staphylococcal nuclease A fused to the signal peptide of outer membrane protein A (OmpA), was excised from pONF1 (16Takahara M. Hibler D.W. Barr P.J. Gerlt J.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2670-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by digestion with XbaI and SalI and ligated into pET21a(+) (Novagen) that had been previously digested withXbaI and XhoI to produce the pETON2 T7expression vector. Mutagenesis of the pETON2 vector was performed using the “Mega-primer” method (17Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) and the QuikChange system (Stratagene). The complete open reading frame for each mutant was sequenced by fluorescent dye termination using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems model 377 automated DNA sequencer. The wild type and mutant overexpressed pro-OmpA nuclease A proteins were purified as described by Chatterjee et al. (18Chatterjee S. Suciu D. Dalbey R.E. Kahn P.C. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged PONA mutants were also prepared as described by Chatterjee et al. except with the substitution of a nickel chelate affinity step for the final ion exchange chromatography step. In this final step, His6 PONA extract was loaded onto a 1-ml bed volume Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Inc.) column and eluted with a stepwise 100–500 mm imidazole gradient. To determine the kinetic constants (kcat, Km) of SipS, we used the preprotein substrate pro-OmpA nuclease A. Substrate concentrations were determined by using anE1% at 280 nm of 8.3 (18Chatterjee S. Suciu D. Dalbey R.E. Kahn P.C. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cleavage reaction (75 μl) was in 50 mm Tris, 10 mmCaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, with the substrate at five different concentrations (37.3, 24.9, 18.7, 12.4, and 6.2 μm). The reaction was initiated by the addition of SipS. The concentration of SipS as determined by the Pierce BCA protein assay kit was 0.33 μm. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C, and aliquots of the reaction were removed at various times so that less than 10% processing of the substrate was achieved. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 5× sample buffer, and the samples were frozen immediately in a dry ice/ethanol bath. The amount of pro-OmpA nuclease A that was processed by SipS was assayed by SDS-PAGE on a 17.2% gel, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The precursor and mature proteins were quantified by scanning the gels on a Technology Resources, Inc. Line Tamer PCLT 300 scanning densitometer. Percentage processing was determined by dividing the area of the mature protein band by the sum of the mature and precursor band areas. The initial rates were determined by plotting the amount of product versus time. The Vmax,kcat, and Km values were extracted from a 1/Vi versus1/[S] plot where Vi is the initial velocity. We used the computer program Microcal Origins to plot the data and for linear regression analysis of the data. All values are from at least three different experiments. The comparisons of the initial rates of processing of the wild type and mutated variants of PONA by Lep or SipS enzymes were performed using a constant substrate concentration of 10 μm and a constant enzyme concentration of 10 nm (for the point mutants) or 0.33 μm (for the more extensive mutations) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100. For each 11-μl reaction volume, 11 μl of 2× dye was added after a 60-min incubation at 37 °C. Initial velocities were determined by densitometric quantitation (as above) of 10-μl aliquots taken at various time points from 84-μl reaction volumes incubated at 37 °C. All reaction samples and time points were run on 17% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. SipS (WT) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 19 μm (400 μg/ml) was diluted into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer with or without 0.5% Triton X-100. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of each dilution to 10 μl of 20 μm PONA with or without 0.5% Triton X-100. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 5× sample buffer. The reaction samples were then run on 17% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The amino acid sequences of Lep (Swiss-Prot number P00803) and SipS (Swiss-Prot P28628) were aligned using the program ClustalX (19Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35492) Google Scholar). Secondary structure-based gap penalties were used in the profile alignment of the two sequences. The secondary structure of the soluble fragment of Lep (8Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank number 1B12) was calculated using the program PROMOTIF (20Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence alignment of B. subtilis type I signal peptidase (SipS) as it compares to E. coli Lep is shown in Fig. 1 A. Whereas the 323-amino acid Lep protein has two transmembrane segments (TM), the 184-amino acid SipS only contains one (Fig. 1 A). SipS-P2 is a SipS deletion mutant construct missing the transmembrane segment (amino acid residues 2–28). SipS and SipS-P2 were expressed and purified as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions. The amino acid sequences of the fusion linker region for MBP-SipS and MBP-SipS-P2 are shown in Fig. 1 B. Expressing full-length and truncatedB. subtilis type I signal peptidase as MBP fusions allowed us to purify 1-mg quantities of the enzyme. We typically obtained approximately 10 mg of pure fusion protein/liter of cell culture. Trypsin was used to cleave the WT SipS from the isolated SipS-MBP fusion protein. On the other hand, because of its higher susceptibility to trypsin digestion, factor Xa was used to cleave SipS-P2 from the SipS-P2-MBP fusion protein. Fig. 2, A and C, show the progression of the purification schemes for SipS and SipS-P2, respectively. SipS-P2 was further purified using hydroxyapatite affinity chromatography (not shown). The addition of detergent to the extraction and purification buffers (1% Triton X-100) did not increase the yield of full-length SipS with the putative transmembrane domain (not shown). The purification data in Fig. 2 reflect purification protocols without the use of any detergents.Figure 2The purification of Bacillus subtilis type 1 signal peptidase ( SipS ). A 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel shows the purification progression of wild type SipS (A) and the P2 domain of SipS, SipS-P2 (C).

In the SipS spectrum (Fig. 2 B), two peaks are seen corresponding to the molecular weights that would be expected if trypsin cleaved at the Arg in the factor Xa cleavage site and at the Lys2 residue (Fig. 1 B). There is an amino-terminal Ile resulting from the construction of the EcoRV restriction site. For SipS-P2, however, the molecular weights indicated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Fig. 2 D) indicate that, in addition to cleavage at the factor Xa site Arg and at Arg30 at the N terminus (Fig. 1 B), cleavage occurs after the sequence -NEMR- at the C terminus of the protein. This results in truncation of SipS-P2 by 3 amino acids at its C terminus. Factor Xa is known to recognize the sequences -IEGR-, -IDGR-, and -AEGR- (21Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), but cleavage at other similar (secondary) sites is not uncommon (22Nagai K. Perutz M.F. Poyart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7252-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 23Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 24Wearne S.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because only two populations of proteins are evident in Fig. 2 D for SipS-P2, cleavage at the C-terminal -NEMR- sequence appears to be better recognized than the -IEGR- or -RIMK- sequences at the N terminus of the protein. Both SipS and SipS-P2 MBP fusion proteins exhibited enzymatic activity before and after cleavage of the MBP moiety (data not shown). The engineered linker region (10 Asn residues) probably provides sufficient flexibility to allow the preprotein substrate access to the SipS active site (Fig. 1 B). After cleavage of the MPB fusion, purified SipS and SipS-P2 enzymes were able to process purified PONA substratein vitro as shown in Fig. 3,A and Fig. B, respectively. The results indicate that the SipS-P2 variant is approximately 100-fold less active than full-length SipS. The kinetic constants of SipS were measured and are presented alongside the Lep results in TableI. Purified SipS exhibits akcat of 0.034 ± 0.006 s−1 and a Km of 44 ± 10 μm. With this substrate, the B. subtilistype I signal peptidase (SipS) is approximately 1300-fold less active than the E. coli leader peptidase. Unfortunately, the much lower activity of the truncated SipS-P2 enzyme prevented us from determining its kinetic parameters.Table IComparison of the kinetic constants of SipS with Lep using the preprotein substrate PONAkcatKmkcat/Kms−1μmm−1 s−1Lep44 ± 919.2 ± 4.62.3 × 106SipS0.034 ± 0.00644 ± 107.7 × 102The activities were measured at pH 8.0 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab The activities were measured at pH 8.0 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Interestingly, the activity of full-length SipS, an enzyme with a transmembrane segment, was only slightly activated by detergent. In a serial dilution activity profile, we observed only a slight increase (5-fold) in activity with SipS in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100 detergent (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, we observed approximately a 100-fold stimulation with the E. coli Δ2–75 (15Tschantz W.R. Paetzel M. Cao G. Suciu D. Inouye M. Dalbey R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3935-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using the same substrate. It also is shown in Fig. 3 D that, even without detergent, full-length SipS exhibits detectable processing of PONA down to a final reaction enzyme concentration of 7 nm(250-fold dilution lane). Processing of PONA by E. coli Lep and B. subtilisSipS at identical cleavage sites was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The calculated mass of the full-length PONA preprotein substrate is 18,839.7 Da, while the mass of the mature nuclease A fragment after processing at the predicted cleavage site (after the sequence -FATVAQA-, discussed below) is 16,811.2 Da. Fig. 4 A indicates complete processing of PONA in a 57 μm PONA, 0.074 μm Lep 5-min reaction (TGC buffer, pH 8.0, 37 °C), resulting in only a mature nuclease A peak of Mr 16,814.0. Conversely, a 20-min reaction of 57 μm PONA, 0.127 μm SipS results in detection of both the parent PONA substrate (Mr18,843.0) and processed nuclease A (Mr 16,813.0) as shown in Fig. 4 B. A series of point mutations in the n-, h-, and c-region of the signal peptide of PONA were constructed to determine the effects on processing by B. subtilis SipS. The initial velocities of SipS processing of the wild type and point mutant PONA substrates are listed in TableII. SipS processed all of the point mutant substrates within the same order of magnitude relative to the wild type substrate. The highest SipS processing occurred with the V−12A and V−4P mutants. The sequence numbering system is relative to the cleavage site (i.e. the residues in the signal peptide are negative, and the numbers in the mature protein are positive). The K−20D and A+1R mutants were processed with roughly twice the initial velocity of the wild type PONA substrate. The mutants at the −8 position (G−8A and G−8R) had little effect on the initial rate of processing. The L−10N mutant was processed at a slightly slower rate than wild type. As expected, the A−1R and A−3R negative control mutants displayed no detectable processing by SipS in the time periods assayed (Table II). A rather surprising result was that a double Arg mutant (V−12R/G−8R) in the h-region of the signal peptide of PONA was processed by SipS (Table II).Table IIThe initial rates of processing of wild-type and point mutants of the preprotein substrate PONA by SipSSubstrateInitial rateRelative ratepmol/minWT0.61.0A + 1R1.52.5V − 4P1.93.2G − 8A0.50.8G − 8R0.71.2L − 10N0.30.5V − 12R2.54.2K − 20D1.72.8A − 1R0.00.0A − 3R0.00.0V − 12R/G − 8R1.52.5 Open table in a new tab To look closer at the role of the h-region and the c-/h-region boundary of the signal peptide with respect to E. coli or B. subtilis SPase I processing, other more extensive amino acid mutants in the signal peptide h- or c-region of the substrate PONA were constructed. The amino acid sequences in the signal peptide region for each of these mutant variants of purified PONA are listed in TableIII. A comparison of processing by purified full-length or truncated E. coli SPase I (Lep, Δ2–75) or B. subtilis SipS (SipS, SipS-P2) enzymes against these purified PONA mutant proteins are illustrated in Fig. 5. The 6HisPONA construct indicates PONA amended with a hexahistidine tag in the N-terminal region of the signal peptide. This purified variant of PONA enabled us to use a more rapid scheme for the purification of the WT form as well as some of the mutated PONA substrates. There were no differences inkcat, Km, and specificity (compared with WT with no His6 tag) resulting from this insertion at the N terminus of PONA (data not shown). Because of the different mutations, the masses of each of the starting unprocessed PONA substrates varied (see No Enzyme added control gel and upper bands in other gels), but, as shown in Fig. 5, an identical lower molecular weight band (mature nuclease A) is present in all cases where processing was detected. Cleavage of each of the purified mutated PONA substrate variants at the identical cleavage site as WTPONA (Mr ∼16,800 for mature nuclease A) was also verified (as in Fig. 4) by mass spectrometry (not shown).Table IIIRepresentative signal sequences of the pro-OmpA nuclease A substrate mutants used in this studyConstructSignal sequence 3-aThe h-region is shown underlined as a point of reference, the mutant amino acid insertions are shown in bold, and the cleavage site (scissile bond) is shown as a dash.

All RGS proteins contain a conserved core domain that can accelerate G protein GTPase activity. In addition, many family members contain a unique N-terminal domain of unknown function. Here, we demonstrate that the RGS protein in yeast, Sst2, is proteolytically processed in vivo to yield separate but functional N-terminal and RGS core domain fragments. In whole cell lysates, the full-lengthSST2 product (82 kDa) as well as a prominent 36-kDa species are specifically recognized by antibodies against the C terminus of the Sst2 protein. Purification and chemical sequencing of the 36-kDa species revealed cleavage sites after Ser-414 and Ser-416, just preceding the region of RGS homology. Expression of a mutationally truncated form of the protein (C-Sst2) could not restore function to ansst2Δ mutant strain. In contrast, co-expression of C-Sst2 with the N-terminal domain (N-Sst2) partially restored the ability to regulate the growth arrest response but not the transcription induction response. Whereas the full-length protein was localized to the microsomal and plasma membrane fractions, the N-Sst2 species was predominantly in the microsomal fraction, and C-Sst2 was in the soluble fraction. Mutations that block proteasome or vacuolar protease function, or mutations in the cleavage site Ser residues of Sst2, did not alter processing. However, Sst2 processing did require expression of other components of the pheromone response pathway, including the receptor and the G protein. These results indicate that Sst2 is proteolytically processed, that this event is regulated by the signaling pathway, and that processing can profoundly alter the function and subcellular localization of the protein.

In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the α-factor pheromone binds a receptor (Ste2), which activates a G protein and triggers a cascade of events leading to cell fusion and mating. G protein activation entails GTP binding to the α subunit (Gpa1), dissociation of Gpa1 from the βγ subunits (Ste4/Ste18), and activation of effector molecules (Ste5, Cdc24, and Ste20) that propagate the signal. Upon GTP hydrolysis, the G protein subunits reassociate and signaling stops. The RGS1 protein Sst2 attenuates G protein signaling by accelerating GTP hydrolysis and promoting subunit reassociation (1Dohlman H.G. Song J. Apanovitch D.M. DiBello P.R. Gillen K.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RGS activity is essential for normal signal regulation in vivo. A disruption of the SST2 gene can increase pheromone sensitivity by 100–300-fold. Conversely, overexpression of SST2 can dampen the pheromone response substantially (2Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of RGS action has been well characterized through detailed biochemical and biophysical analysis of purified components (3Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

RGS proteins act by binding and stabilizing three “switch” regions that undergo conformational change upon GTP hydrolysis. Stabilization of the transition state conformation appears to lower the energy of activation, leading to a 10–1000-fold increase in the rate of the reaction (6Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

This translates to a comparable increase in protein expression levels (2Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also in response to pheromone, Sst2 is stoichiometrically phosphorylated at Ser-539. This phosphorylation leads to an electrophoretic mobility shift, from 82 to 84 kDa, and appears to slow the overall rate of degradation of the phosphorylated 84-kDa species (25Garrison T.R. Zhang Y.

Here we present a novel and previously undescribed mechanism by which cells can post-translationally regulate RGS function, proteolytic processing. In the course of our studies on Sst2 phosphorylation, we noted that the mobility shift of full-length Sst2 paralleled that of a much smaller protein also recognized by our Sst2 antibodies. This smaller protein corresponds in size to the RGS core domain in Sst2 (∼36 kDa). The experiments described here were aimed at testing the possibility that this Sst2 fragment is expressed and functionalin vivo. We show that the 36-kDa product is the result of endoproteolytic processing of the full-length protein, that processing is regulated, and that this processing event leads to profound alterations in the activity and subcellular distribution of Sst2. Expression analysis was carried out in the S. cerevisiae strain YPH499 (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801 am ade2-101 oc trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1) or the isogenic sst2Δ strain YDM400 (YPH499, sst2-Δ2).

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pRS316-ADH (CEN, ampR, URA3, ADH1 promoter/terminator) (41Song J. Hirschman J. Gunn K. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol.

McCabe, Onyx Pharmaceutical). pAD4M-SST2 was constructed by digesting SST2 withSalI (mutant site, −35 nt relative to the initiator ATG) and SacI and ligating into the corresponding sites of pAD4M (42Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The construction of pAD4M-SST2-his was described previously (25Garrison T.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36387-36391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). pRS316-ADH-SST2 was constructed by digesting pRS315-GAL-SST2 (42Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with BamHI (mutant site, −29 nt relative to the initiator ATG; multiple cloning site adjacent to the SST2 HindIII at nucleotide 3539) and ligating into the corresponding site in pRS316-ADH. pRS316-ADH-N-SST2 was constructed by PCR so as to include a mutant BamHI site at position −1 nt with respect to the initiator ATG, SST2 codons 1–392, a Myc epitope tag (DKLDLEEQKLISEEDLLRK-STOP), and an EcoRI site three nucleotides after the stop codon. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pRS316-ADH. pRS315-ADH-C-SST2 (also known as ADHleu-C-SST2) was constructed by PCR so as to include a mutant BamHI site at position −1 nt with respect to Met-411, codons 411–698 of SST2, and anEcoRI site immediately following the stop codon. The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pRS316-ADH and then transferred as a PvuI-PvuI cassette into the corresponding sites of pRS315. pPEC-GST-SST2 was obtained from K. Madura, (Rutgers University); its construction was described previously (referred to as pPEC9) (43Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Madura K. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Triple substitution mutations at Ser-414, -415, and -416 were constructed in pRS316-ADH-SST2 using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic oligonucleotides (plus complementary strands, not shown) are as follows: 5′ CT CAA GAC ATG CTT ATC GCT GCG GCT AAT TTA AAT AAG CTT GAC 3′ (Ala substitutions), 5′ CT CAA GAC ATG CTT ATC TTC TTC TTC AAT TTA AAT AAA CTG GAC 3′ (Phe), and 5′ CT CAA GAC ATG CTT ATC CAG CAG CAG AAT TTA AAT AAA CTG GAC 3′ (Gln). pRS423-FUS1-lacZ was constructed by inserting aHindIII-HindIII fragment containing theFUS1-lacZ cassette from pMD56 (44Sommers C.M. Dumont M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 559-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) into theHindIII site of pRS425 to yield pRS425-FUS1-lacZ. This product was digested with XhoI and EagI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pRS423. All PCR-amplified products were confirmed by DNA sequencing (W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University). Cells were grown at 30 °C in selective media to mid-log phase and treated with 2.5 μm α-factor pheromone for 1 h, unless otherwise indicated. Temperature-sensitive mutants were grown at 24 °C to early-log phase and then shifted to 37 °C for 3 h, in the last hour they were treated with 2.5 μm α-factor. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 24 °C, then resuspended (1.5 × 106 cells/μl) in 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.0005% bromphenol blue), and boiled for 10 min. In some cases, cells were washed and stored briefly in 10 mmNaN3, on ice. The cells were disrupted by glass bead vortex homogenization (Sigma, G-8772) for 4 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at −20 °C. Lysates were reheated at 37 °C for 20 min before SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. Immunoblots using antibodies to Sst2 (2Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell.

A. 1978; 75: 4962-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were carried out as described (48). YDM400 cells transformed with pAD4M-SST2-his were grown to A 600 nm ∼1.0, chilled, mixed with 10 mm NaN3, and harvested by centrifugation. They were then washed once in 10 mmNaN3 and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. On the day of the purification, cells were thawed in Urea Buffer (6 murea, 100 mm Na2H2PO4, 10 mm Tris, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, and 15 mm imidazole (at 250 ml per 11 liters of original culture) at room temperature. Cells were further disrupted using a stainless steel beadbeater (Biospec) packed in ice and salt, with 10 × 30-s pulses, once every 90 s. The remaining procedures were carried out at room temperature. The disrupted cells were rocked for 75 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 3840 × g for 20 min and paper filtration (Whatman No. 1). The soluble material was mixed with 3 ml of equilibrated Superflow nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) for 60–90 min, packed into an HR 10/10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, and washed using 10 column volumes of Urea Buffer, 250 mm NaCl, and 15 mm imidazole at 1.5 ml/min, followed by 10 column volumes of Urea Buffer at 1 ml/min. Sst2 was eluted in 10 column volumes of Urea Buffer and 75 mmimidazole at 1 ml/min. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and desalted using an Ultrafree-10 (Millipore) filter. The final purified product (in 75 μl) was resolved by 11% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (ProBlott, Applied Biosystems). Protein was visualized using a Coomassie Blue stain (0.025% in 50% methanol). The 36-kDa band was excised and submitted for N-terminal sequencing using an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 cLc instrument equipped with an on-line high performance liquid chromatograph (W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University). Halo and reporter-transcription assays were performed as described (49Sprague Jr., G.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For the pheromone-dependent growth inhibition assay (halo assay), cultures were grown to saturation (2–3 days), and 100 μl was diluted with 2 ml of sterile water, followed by the addition of 2 ml of 1% (w/v) dissolved agar (60 °C). This mixture was then poured onto an agar plate containing selective medium. Sterile filter discs were spotted with synthetic α-factor pheromone (5 and 15 μg for each plate) and placed onto the nascent lawn. The resulting zone of growth-arrested cells was documented after 2 days. For pheromone-dependent reporter-transcription assays, cells were transformed with pRS423-FUS1-lacZ and grown to mid-log phase. Cultures were then aliquoted (90 μl) to a 96-well plate and mixed with 10 μl of α-factor, in triplicate. Final α-factor concentrations ranged from 0 to 100 μm. After 90 min at 30 °C, β-galactosidase activity was measured by adding 20 μl of a freshly prepared solution of 83 μm fluorescein di-β-d-galactopyranoside (Molecular Probes, 10 mm stock in Me2SO), 137.5 mmPIPES, pH 7.2, and 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubating for 90 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 1m Na2CO3, and the resulting fluorescence activity was measured with a multiwell plate reader using 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission. All determinations were carried out at least twice with similar results, unless otherwise indicated. Methods for cell membrane fractionation have been described in detail elsewhere (41Song J. Hirschman J. Gunn K. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20273-20283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown at 30 °C in selective media to mid-log phase, centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in rich media (YPD) at A 600 nm = 0.5/ml. Cells were grown for one doubling period, the last hour of which they were treated with 2.5 μm α-factor. Growth was then stopped by addition of NaN3 to 10 mm. Approximately 3 × 109 cells were centrifuged and washed once with SK buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 0.1 mKPO4, pH 7.5). Spheroplasts were then prepared by resuspending the cells in 10 ml of SK buffer containing 1 mg of zymolyase 100T (Kirin Brewery) and 28.8 mm2-mercaptoethanol for 45 min at 30 °C. All subsequent manipulations were performed at 0–4 °C. Spheroplasts were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, washed once with SK buffer and once with lysis buffer (0.8 m sucrose, 20 mmtriethanolamine, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA acid, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture containing 1 mm [4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, HCl] and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and benzamidine (final concentrations)). Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer and disrupted with 25 strokes of a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The lysate was cleared of unbroken cells and debris by centrifuging twice at 500 × g for 10 min. 200 μl of this lysate (“cleared lysate”) (total, “T”) was added to an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. For isolation of total cell membranes, approximately 300 μl of the cleared lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The top 100 μl of supernatant (“S” fraction) was diluted with 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. The pellet (“P”) was resuspended in lysis buffer to the original volume, mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. For resolution of cell membrane compartments, 606 mg of sucrose was added to 650 μl of the cleared lysate (T) and dissolved (final sucrose concentration 70% w/v). The sample was transferred to a Beckman thin walled polypropylene tube and overlaid with 1-ml sucrose solutions of 60, 50, 40, and 30% (w/v) in 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 8, respectively. The samples were then centrifuged in a Beckman SW40Ti swinging bucket rotor for 16 h at 190,000 × g in a Beckman L-80 ultracentrifuge. Sixteen samples of 300 μl each were collected from the bottom of the gradient into 100 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Fractions 1–14 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. The SST2gene encodes a 698-amino acid protein with a predicted mass of 79,696 Da. Immunoblots of whole cell lysates revealed a protein near the predicted size of the full-length product (∼82 kDa) as well as a number of prominent lower molecular weight species, one of which migrates at ∼36 kDa (Fig. 1,p36). Since our antibodies are directed to the last 365 residues of Sst2, this low molecular weight species probably corresponds to a C-terminal, proteolytically processed form of the protein. It is unlikely to be derived from another gene product, since it is absent in an SST2-deficient strain (Fig. 1,sst2Δ) and is more abundant in cells that overexpressSST2 from a plasmid (Fig. 1, sst2Δ + Sst2 o.e.). It is also not the result of alternative mRNA splicing, since SST2 is encoded by a single exon. The multiple bands in the 36-kDa region correspond to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of two slightly different sized fragments of Sst2 (see below).Figure 1The RGS core domain is expressed in vivo. Whole cell lysates were prepared from theSST2-deficient strain YDM400 transformed with an empty vector pAD4M (sst2Δ), the isogenic wild-type strain YPH499 (wt strain), and strain YDM400 transformed with the Sst2-overexpression plasmid pAD4M-SST2 (sst2Δ + Sst2 o.e.). Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (11% acrylamide) and immunoblotting with antibodies against Sst2 (Sst2 Ab). Specific immunoreactive bands were detected at ∼82 kDa (Full-length), 55 kDa (p55), and 36 kDa (p36). The doublets observed likely represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of Sst2. Additional heterogeneity of the p36 species is likely due to the presence of slightly different sized Sst2 fragments (see Figs. 2 and 6). Molecular mass standards (kDa) are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Significantly, p36 corresponds in size to the RGS core domain of Sst2 (residues ∼417–698). For some mammalian RGS proteins, the core domain is sufficient for GTPase activating function in vitro(10Popov S., Yu, K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and for signal attenuating activity in cell culture (50DiBello P.R. Garrison T.R. Apanovitch D.M. Hoffman G. Shuey D.J. Mason K.

Thus we considered whether this naturally occurring fragment of Sst2 is functional as an RGS protein in vivo. We first set out to confirm the identity of the 36-kDa species. Initially, we examined whether this product extends completely to the C terminus of Sst2. Our approach here was to determine if a similarly sized fragment could be detected using an antibody directed to the extreme C terminus of the protein. Accordingly, a hexahistidine tag (−His) was appended to the 3′ end of the full-length open reading frame and expressed. The Sst2-His fusion is fully functional, as determined by its ability to complement the sst2Δ gene disruption mutant (25Garrison T.R. Zhang Y. Pausch M. Apanovitch D. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. J.

The interaction with PPCA is essential for the correct intracellular routing and lysosomal localization of neuraminidase, but the mechanism of its catalytic activation is unclear. To investigate this process, we have used the baculovirus expression system to co-express neuraminidase and PPCA precursors in insect cells, which resulted in high enzymatic activity of neuraminidase. Both the 34- and 20-kDa PPCA subunits were required for the activation. We further demonstrated that when expressed alone, the neuraminidase precursor remained dimeric (114 kDa) and had low enzymatic activity, but when co-expressed with PPCA and β-galactosidase, it multimerized in a complex of ∼1350 kDa, together with the other two proteins. The fully active neuraminidase co-precipitated with full-length PPCA and β-galactosidase precursors. However, when co-expressed with the individual PPCA subunits, neuraminidase co-precipitated only with the small 20-kDa polypeptide, which therefore must contain a neuraminidase-binding site.

Biochem. 1985; 149: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have shown that human neuraminidase purified from placenta was inactive at neutral pH but could be reactivated in vitro by concentrating the preparation at 37 °C and acidic pH, which resulted in a 4-fold increase in activity for every 2-fold increase of concentration. On sucrose density gradients, the “stabilized” enzyme coprecipitated with the 32-kDa PPCA subunit and β-galactosidase, suggesting that assembly into a multienzyme complex stabilized/protected the neuraminidase activity. In galactosialidosis fibroblasts, in the absence of PPCA, the 10–15% residual β-galactosidase activity increased upon addition to the culture medium of the protease inhibitor leupeptin, which pointed to a protective role of PPCA against proteolytic degradation of β-galactosidase (6Pshezhetsky A.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28359-28365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16d'Azzo A. Hoogeveen A. Reuser A.J. Robinson D. Galjaard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1982; 703: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting a different way for PPCA to influence neuraminidase activity. We have previously shown that human and mouse lysosomal neuraminidase expressed in COS-1 cells and fibroblasts from patients with sialidosis associate with PPCA shortly after synthesis and segregate to mature lysosomes only when accompanied by wild-type PPCA, but not by transport-impaired PPCA mutants (18van der Spoel A. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Early interaction is needed because neuraminidase is poorly phosphorylated, even in the presence of PPCA, and its mannose 6-phosphate marker is not functional in receptor-mediated endocytosis of the enzyme (18van der Spoel A. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, PPCA functions as an auxiliary transport protein for neuraminidase, and neuraminidase acquires full enzymatic activity in mature lysosomes only when bound to PPCA. In contrast, others have reported that in galactosialidosis fibroblasts, neuraminidase does reach the lysosomes but is rapidly degraded because of the absence of functional PPCA (19Vinogradova M. Michaud L. Mezentsev A. Lukong K. El-Alfy M. Morales C. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the exact mechanism by which PPCA controls both the catalytic activation of neuraminidase and the maintenance/regulation of its enzymatic activity is unknown. We have utilized the baculovirus (BV) expression in insect cells to study the mechanism of catalytic activation of PPCA and demonstrated that the one-chain zymogen is cleaved into a two-chain mature enzyme by a trypsin-like protease, removing a linker peptide between the two subunits (20Bonten E.J.

The structural basis of this activation mechanism were assessed after the determination of the three-dimensional structure of human PPCA precursor that showed that the active site is preformed in the zymogen but is blocked by a “maturation subdomain” (21Rudenko G. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1249-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Removal of the linker peptide causes conformational changes of the maturation subdomain, exposing the active site (21Rudenko G. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1249-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here we have developed a similar approach to elucidate the mechanism of catalytic activation of neuraminidase in insect cells. When using baculovirus constructs, several factors can influence the level of protein expression in insect cells, including the type of baculovirus vector, the type of insect cells, the multiplicity of infection, the type of culture medium, the time of infection, and the stability of the overexpressed protein (22Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1988; 167: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 47-55Crossref Scopus (870) Google Scholar). When high expression levels are achieved, the recombinant protein is usually clearly visible on Coomassie-stained SDS-gels containing total cell lysates. Taking that into account, we expressed neuraminidase in insect cells and studied the in vivo and in vitro interactions with co-expressed PPCA and β-galactosidase. Our results indicate that neuraminidase is catalytically activated by conformational changes that occur when the enzyme shifts from a 114-kDa dimeric form to an oligomeric complex of ∼1350 kDa. This activation occurs exclusively at acidic pH and is triggered by its interaction with PPCA. Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (IPLB-SF21) were cultured in monolayers at 27 °C in TNM-FH medium (24Hink W.F. Nature. 1970; 226: 466-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Recombinant BV constructs encoding mouse and human neuraminidase (Moneur and Huneur, respectively), human β-galactosidase, and mouse PPCA (MPP54) were generated through homologous recombination in insect cells of wild-type BV DNA (AcMNPV) and the respective cDNAs (20Bonten E.J.

The generation and characterization of BV constructs encoding human PPCA (HPP54) and the two separate human PPCA subunits (PP32 and PP20) was described earlier (20Bonten E.J. Galjart N.J.

Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits (Rockland) against BV-expressed human β-galactosidase, human PPCA (anti-hPPCA), and mouse PPCA (anti-mPPCA) precursor proteins. The secreted proteins were affinity-purified on concanavalin A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The generation of anti-human neuraminidase antibodies (anti-Neur) was described earlier (2Bonten E. Spoel A.v. d. Fornerod M. Grosveld G. d'Azzo A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3156-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). All antibodies recognize the BV-expressed proteins against which they were raised but also the endogenous mammalian proteins. For biosynthetic labeling studies, Sf21 cells were seeded in six-well dishes and grown until 80–90% confluence and infected with BV at a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque-forming units/cell. Two days after infection, the cells were radiolabeled for 16 h with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described earlier (20Bonten E.J. Galjart N.J. Willemsen R.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography of the gels soaked in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sf21 cells were propagated in three-dimensional bottles (Nunc) until 80–90% confluence and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 with Moneur. The cells were dislodged 2 days after infection by tapping the bottles firmly. All steps were carried out at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm. The cells were lysed in water and 1% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem) for 30 min. Triethanolamine (TEA; stock solution: 0.2 m, pH 8.75) and water were added to the lysate to obtain final concentrations: 20 mm TEA, pH 8.75, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The lysate was ultracentrifugated (Beckman SW28 rotor, 25,000 rpm, 1 h), and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. Neuraminidase was fast protein liquid chromatography-purified on a Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a salt gradient of 0–150 mm NaCl (20 mm TEA, pH 8.75). The neuraminidase eluted at ∼80 mm NaCl and was concentrated in Centriprep 10 units (Amicon) to 1–3 mg/ml. Neuraminidase was further purified on a Sephacryl S300HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm TEA, pH 8.75, 100 mm NaCl. The neuraminidase-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated as described above. The column was calibrated with molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fixed amounts of purified mouse neuraminidase were mixed with increasing concentrations of concanavalin A-Sepharose-purified mouse PPCA, human PPCA, human β-galactosidase, or bovine serum albumin in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 or 6.8, and 100 mm NaCl and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Neuraminidase activity was assayed with the artificial 4-methylumbelliferyl substrate (Sigma) according to Galjaard (43Galjaard H. Genetic Metabolic Diseases: Early Signs and Prenatal Analysis. Elsevier, New York1980: 817Google Scholar). Aliquots of in vitro activated neuraminidase with and without PPCA were resolved on a Sephacryl S300HR column (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 100 mmNaCl). Eluted fractions were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon; Millipore Corp.), and incubated with anti-Neur and anti-PPCA antibodies. Sf21 cells were infected in six-well dishes with fixed amounts of Moneur and increasing amounts of either MPP54, HPP54, PP32, PP20, and PP20 plus PP32 (as described above). Two days after infection, the cells were harvested, and the neuraminidase activity was assayed. The cell lysates were separated on a Sephacryl S300HR gel filtration column (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl), and the eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting and neuraminidase activity assays (as described above). In mammalian cells, neuraminidase depends on its association with a transport-competent PPCA for lysosomal localization (18van der Spoel A. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In insect cells, instead, PPCA does not reach the vacuole but accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments and is hardly processed into the mature and catalytically active two-chain form (20Bonten E.J. Galjart N.J. Willemsen R. Usmany M. Vlak J.M. d'Azzo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26441-26445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using BV-infected insect cells to co-express neuraminidase with PPCA and/or β-galactosidase, we could now test whether PPCA influences neuraminidase activity in a manner that is independent from its intracellular compartmentalization. For co-expression studies, it was crucial to obtain comparable levels of expression of the different components. Previously we overexpressed in Sf21 cells three baculovirus constructs that encode the human PPCA (HPP54) and the two separate PPCA subunits (PP32 and PP20) (20Bonten E.J. Galjart N.J. Willemsen R. Usmany M. Vlak J.M. d'Azzo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26441-26445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The expression levels of these proteins were comparable as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and Coomassie staining of SDS-gels (20Bonten E.J. Galjart N.J. Willemsen R. Usmany M. Vlak J.M. d'Azzo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26441-26445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We now made baculovirus constructs that encode human neuraminidase (Huneur), mouse neuraminidase (Moneur), mouse PPCA (MPP54), and human β-galactosidase. To select the best expressing clones, up to 10 baculovirus clones were screened for each protein by infecting the virus in Sf21 cells and analyzing the recombinant proteins on Coomassie-stained SDS-gels, before and after concanavalin A-Sepharose purification (see “Experimental Procedures”). Furthermore, the best expressing clones were also tested in metabolically labeled insect cells infected individually with 50 μl of Moneur-, MPP54-, HPP54-, β-galactosidase-, HPP34-, and HPP20-recombinant baculoviruses. Two days after infection, cells were labeled for 16 h with [35S]methionine. Radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies (anti-Neur, anti-PPCA, and anti-β-galactosidase) and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A). The molecular weights of the expressed and immunoprecipitated proteins are summarized in TableI. The 18- and 75-kDa polypeptides (Fig.1 A, lanes 5 and 8) represented nonglycosylated forms of the small PPCA subunit and the β-galactosidase precursor, respectively, since treatment withN-glycosidase F or inhibition with the N-linked glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin did not alter their mobility on SDS-PAGE (Ref. 20Bonten E.J.

These results confirmed that all proteins were expressed at similar levels, with the exception of human neuraminidase (Huneur), which was expressed at a considerably lower level than the other proteins (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). For this reason, we chose to use the mouse (Moneur) rather than the human neuraminidase construct (Huneur) in co-expression experiments. This approach was further justified by earlier studies demonstrating that interaction of the three enzymes is not species-specific, but each of the human enzymes can be substituted by its murine counterpart in the enzyme-complex (26Galjart N.J. Gillemans N. Meijer D. d'Azzo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4678-4684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Zhou X.Y. Morreau H. Rottier R. Davis D. Bonten E. Gillemans N. Wenger D.

The cells were harvested 2 days after infection and assayed for neuraminidase activity. Both human and mouse PPCA were able to increase the neuraminidase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, although mouse PPCA was somewhat more effective in this function (Fig. 1 B), whereas β-galactosidase had no effect at all on the neuraminidase activity (Fig. 1 B). Aliquots of the different cell lysates, analyzed on Western blots probed with anti-Neur antibodies, showed that the expression levels of the 46-kDa neuraminidase proteins were comparable in all samples. Small variations in expression levels and stability of the human and mouse PPCA may account for the differences in the level of measured neuraminidase activity. Both human and mouse PPCA did not affect the level of expression or the stability of neuraminidase, as shown on Western blots (Fig. 1 B, inset), but their interaction with neuraminidase clearly activated the enzyme. To determine whether a full-length PPCA was needed for this process or either of the two PPCA subunits (PP20 and PP32) would be sufficient for neuraminidase activation, insect cells were co-infected with a constant amount of Moneur inoculum (50 μl) and increasing concentrations of PP20, PP32, or a combination of the two. Two days after infection, cells were harvested and assayed for neuraminidase activity. The separate subunits did not affect the enzyme activity (Fig.1 C). However, a significant increase in activity was observed when both PPCA subunits were co-expressed with neuraminidase (Fig. 1 C). The levels of the 46-kDa protein on Western blots were comparable in all samples (Fig. 1 C, inset). Thus, a full-length PPCA protein, in the form of the one-chain precursor or the two-chain mature enzyme, is needed for catalytic activation of neuraminidase. Our results have shown that PPCA by itself has the ability to activate neuraminidase. We further investigated whether the three-enzyme complex could assemble also in insect cells and whether neuraminidase activity would change in the context of this complex. We first analyzed by gel filtration the native molecular mass of mouse neuraminidase alone or in combination with the 85-kDa β-galactosidase precursor, the 54-kDa PPCA precursor, or both PPCA subunits. Total cell lysates from BV-infected insect cells were resolved on a Sephacryl S300HR column, and the eluted fractions were analyzed on Western blots, probed with polyclonal antibodies specific for either of the three proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). Neuraminidase expressed alone eluted at a molecular mass of ∼114 kDa, probably as a dimer (Fig.2 A). When co-expressed with PPCA and β-galactosidase, a small amount of neuraminidase oligomerized and eluted from the column in fractions corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼1350 kDa (Fig. 2 B). These fractions also contained small amounts of PPCA and β-galactosidase, suggesting that the three enzymes were in complex (Fig. 2 B). However, most of the neuraminidase, PPCA, and β-galactosidase eluted at 114–85 kDa (Fig. 2 B) and were not associated. When co-expressed with both PPCA subunits, a small percentage of neuraminidase again eluted at ∼1350 kDa (Fig. 2 C). However, neither of the two subunits was resolved together with neuraminidase in these fractions, suggesting that they were either only transiently associated with neuraminidase, but just enough to trigger the oligomerization of the enzyme, or they were still in complex with neuraminidase, but their amount was too low to be detected on the Western blot. Co-expression of neuraminidase with only β-galactosidase did not promote oligomerization of the enzyme (Fig.2 D), confirming that β-galactosidase was not directly involved in this process. The gel filtration eluates were also assayed for neuraminidase activity (Fig. 2 E). The dimeric enzyme had very low activity (Fig.2 E, upper left panel). The neuraminidase that was eluted at 1350 kDa, together with PPCA and β-galactosidase, was also catalytically active (Fig. 2 E,upper right panel). Given that only a small percentage of neuraminidase was resolved in these high molecular weight fractions (Fig. 2 B, lower panel), this oligomeric neuraminidase had a substantially higher specific activity (10–20 times) than the dimeric form. In contrast, the ∼1350-kDa oligomeric neuraminidase, resolved on gel filtration after co-expression with the separate PPCA subunits, was catalytically inactive (Fig. 2 E, lower left panel), despite the relatively high amounts detected on Western blots (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the oligomerization of neuraminidase is not sufficient for its catalytic activation, which apparently requires stable association with PPCA. To demonstrate that neuraminidase was indeed associated with PPCA and β-galactosidase, insect cells were co-infected with the BV constructs listed in Table I. Two days after infection, cells were metabolically labeled for 16 h with [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled proteins were precipitated with specific antibodies (anti-Neur, anti-PPCA, anti-PP32, anti-β-galactosidase), and the immunoprecipitated products were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The 54-kDa PPCA precursor was readily co-immunoprecipitated with neuraminidase using anti-Neur antibodies (Fig. 3, lane 2). Surprisingly, only the 20-kDa and not the 34-kDa subunit of PPCA co-precipitated with neuraminidase (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that this subunit contains a neuraminidase-interacting domain. It is not clear at this moment whether the large PPCA subunit did not bind at all to neuraminidase or whether this interaction was too weak to withstand the immunoprecipitation conditions. The 34-kDa PPCA subunit was, however, co-precipitated with the 20-kDa PPCA polypeptide using antibodies that are specific for the small subunit (Fig. 3, lane 6). Neuraminidase also co-precipitated efficiently with the β-galactosidase precursor using anti-β-galactosidase antibodies (Fig. 3, lane 1), indicating that the two proteins did interact strongly, although β-galactosidase did not appear to influence the activity of neuraminidase (Figs. 1 and 2). Mouse neuraminidase associated equally well with the human and mouse forms of PPCA and β-galactosidase (31Rottier R. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 (lane 2), PPCA precursor co-precipitated with neuraminidase only with anti-Neur and not with anti-PPCA antibodies, while neuraminidase co-precipitated with β-galactosidase only with anti-β-galactosidase and not with anti-Neur antibodies (Fig. 3, lane 1). This was probably caused by the inability of some of the antibodies to recognize the associated proteins, which may no longer expose the epitopes against which the antibodies were raised. Together, the results indicate that neuraminidase, PPCA, and β-galactosidase can physically associate in insect cells, forming a ∼1350-kDa enzyme-complex (Fig.2 B). The ability to produce in insect cells and purify large quantities of neuraminidase, PPCA, and β-galactosidase (see “Experimental Procedures”) allowed us to test in vitro the catalytic activation of neuraminidase. Dimeric mouse neuraminidase (pH 8.75) was mixed with increasing amounts of either mouse or human PPCA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature at pH 5.0 or 6.8. Afterward, the samples were assayed for neuraminidase activity. Incubation with both mouse and human PPCA (MPP54 and HPP54) resulted in the increase of neuraminidase activity, but only under acidic conditions (Fig.4 A), while β-galactosidase or bovine serum albumin had no effect on the activity (data not shown). This demonstrated that PPCA controls the catalytic activation of neuraminidase in a pH-dependent manner. To determine whether catalytic activation had any effect on the molecular weight of neuraminidase, we separated neuraminidase, either PPCA-activated or mock-activated, on a Sephacryl S300HR gel filtration column. The eluates were analyzed on Western blots probed with anti-Neur antibodies (Fig. 4 B). PPCA-activated neuraminidase was recovered in two separate pools, as oligomers of ∼560 kDa and as oligomers of ∼1100 kDa. In contrast, mock-incubated neuraminidase was mainly recovered in fractions ranging from 100 to 400 kDa (Fig. 4 B,lower panel). These results indicate that alsoin vitro PPCA was able to promote the oligomerization of neuraminidase. This process appeared to take place in two steps. Initially, oligomers of ∼600 kDa were formed that probably consisted of six dimers that further multimerized in an ∼1100-kDa form. We conclude that the interaction between PPCA and neuraminidase is required for both the oligomerization and catalytic activity of neuraminidase, and the two events cannot be separated. Lysosomal neuraminidase shares significant homology with other bacterial and mammalian members of the sialidase superfamily (2Bonten E. Spoel A.v. d. Fornerod M. Grosveld G. d'Azzo A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3156-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Most neuraminidases are monomeric, but higher oligomeric states have been reported (44Taylor G. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The crystal structures of bacterial and viral sialidases revealed that the fold topology of these enzymes is identical and consists of a six-bladed β-propeller around an axis that passes through the active site (32Crennell S.J.

Nevertheless, it is the only member of the sialidase superfamily to require an accessory protein (PPCA) for its transport, catalytic activity, and stability in lysosomes. Little is known about the mechanism of complex assembly between neuraminidase, PPCA, and β-galactosidase. We have used the baculovirus expression system to co-express neuraminidase in insect cells, with PPCA and β-galactosidase precursors, and the two separate PPCA subunits (20Bonten E.J. Galjart N.J. Willemsen R. Usmany M. Vlak J.M. d'Azzo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26441-26445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). BV-encoded PPCA precursor and the two separate subunits were synthesized in the insect cells in large amounts and transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi compartment, but they were not segregated to the vacuole, which explains their lack of maturation (20Bonten E.J. Galjart N.J. Willemsen R. Usmany M. Vlak J.M. d'Azzo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26441-26445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells we could not separate the effect that PPCA had on the transport of neuraminidase to lysosomes (18van der Spoel A. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) from the actual activation event. Since PPCA and neuraminidase probably lack the appropriate signals for vacuolar sorting in insect cells, we were able to test the influence of PPCA on the catalytic activation of neuraminidase, independent from its intracellular transport. Many lysosomal hydrolases, after segregation to lysosomes, undergo partial proteolytic processing, resulting in the removal of either C-terminal or N-terminal fragments, leading to the mature, active forms of the enzymes (36Braulke T. Mason L.A. Origin of Lysosomal Proteins. 27. Plenum Press, New York1996: 15-49Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the mechanisms of catalytic activation of lysosomal β-galactosidase and PPCA, showing that both are two-subunit enzymes. The 85-kDa β-galactosidase precursor is C-terminally processed by the cleavage of a 24-kDa domain, which remains noncovalently associated to the 64-kDa N-terminal polypeptide (37van der Spoel A.C. Bonten E.J. d'Azzo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10035-10040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The one-chain PPCA zymogen is processed by a trypsin-like protease, removing an ∼20-amino acid linker-peptide between the two subunits. The two subunits are linked by disulfide bridges, resulting in a 32/20-kDa two-chain active enzyme (20Bonten E.J. Galjart N.J. Willemsen R. Usmany M. Vlak J.M. d'Azzo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26441-26445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of BV-expressed PPCA precursor indicated that the removal of the linker-peptide triggers conformational changes in a subdomain of the PPCA, that in turn expose the catalytic pocket (21Rudenko G. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1249-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Unlike PPCA and β-galactosidase precursors, neuraminidase is catalytically activated by a different mechanism that requires the interaction with PPCA. A pool of neuraminidase, PPCA, and β-galactosidase, when co-expressed in insect cells, assembled into a high molecular weight complex. The exact stoichiometry of this multienzyme complex is unknown, but its molecular mass in insect cells (1350 kDa) is similar to the 1000–1300-kDa molecular mass of the multienzyme complex isolated from human fibroblasts and various other mammalian tissues (6Pshezhetsky A.

The number of PPCA and β-galactosidase molecules in the complex remains uncertain. The multimerization of neuraminidase occurs only at acidic pH, which implies that in mammalian cells the high molecular weight complex is assembled in lysosomes. We have shown earlier that in the absence of PPCA, neuraminidase formed crystals when overexpressed in COS-1 cells. However, co-expression of neuraminidase with PPCA prevented crystal formation and promoted its transport to the lysosomes and catalytic activation (18van der Spoel A. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Bonten E.J. Galjart N.J. Willemsen R. Usmany M. Vlak J.M. d'Azzo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26441-26445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Association with PPCA appeared to mediate correct folding and oligomerization of the enzyme, preventing aggregation of partially folded or unfolded molecules. A similar mechanism has been described for the coagulation proteins von Willebrand factor and factor VIII (42Kaufman R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1423: 13-27PubMed Google Scholar). Factor VIII needs to associate with von Willebrand factor for correct folding and segregation into the secretory pathway. In von Willebrand patients, who are deficient in von Willebrand factor, factor VIII aggregates and is subsequently degraded. The dependence of a molecule on the association with a partner may be an important mechanism to regulate at the protein level its biological activity. Especially for neuraminidase, this principle could hold true. Sialic acid residues, as the terminal sugars on carbohydrate chains, are the first targets for hydrolysis. Thus, it may not always be beneficial to have catalytically active neuraminidase in the lysosomes. An equilibrium between neuraminidase and PPCA could maintain the required level of neuraminidase activity. In turn, this could explain the “instability” of neuraminidase during enzyme purifications, which is caused by dissociation from the complex and/or detachment from PPCA (6Pshezhetsky A. Potier M. J.

Given the biological integrity and functionality of BV-expressed neuraminidase, including its association with PPCA and β-galactosidase, this expression system can be of great value not only for biochemical analysis but also for the crystallization and three-dimensional structure determination of this enzyme and ultimately of the multienzyme complex.

https://openalex.org/W2075154719,"Eukaryotic mRNA synthesis is a highly regulated process involving numerous proteins acting in concert with RNA polymerase II to set levels of transcription from individual promoters. The transcription reaction consists of multiple steps beginning with preinitiation complex formation and ending in the production of a full-length primary transcript. We used pre-steady-state approaches to study the steps of human mRNA transcription at the adenovirus major late promoter in a minimalin vitro transcription system. These kinetic studies revealed an early transition in RNA polymerase II transcription, termed escape commitment, that occurs after initiation and prior to promoter escape. Escape commitment is rapid and is characterized by sensitivity to competitor DNA. Upon completion of escape commitment, ternary complexes are resistant to challenge by competitor DNA and slowly proceed forward through promoter escape. Escape commitment is stimulated by transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIH. We measured forward and reverse rate constants for discrete steps in transcription and present a kinetic model for the mechanism of RNA polymerase II transcription that describes five distinct steps (preinitiation complex formation, initiation, escape commitment, promoter escape, and transcript elongation) and clearly shows promoter escape is rate-limiting in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2028909212,"Recently, we have described a novel gene,DD3, which is one of the most prostate cancer-specific genes described to date (Bussemakers, M. J.

The prostate cancer-specific expression of DD3 indicates that theDD3 gene promoter is a promising tool for the treatment of prostate cancer. To identify the promoter elements that are responsible for the prostate cancer-specific expression of DD3, we have isolated and characterized the DD3 promoter. Sequence analysis of the DD3 5′-flanking region was performed and several promoter-human growth hormone reporter constructs were prepared, which were transiently transfected in the DD3-positive cell line LNCaP and several DD3-negative cell lines. Using a 500-base pair DD3 promoter construct, we could detect promoter activity in LNCaP cells, which was not affected by increasing the size of the constructs. Truncated constructs, however, showed an increased transcriptional activity, suggesting the presence of a silencer that negatively regulates the expression of DD3. DNase-I footprint analysis, using nuclear extracts from LNCaP cells, revealed the presence of three DNase-I-protected areas within the DD3 proximal promoter. We show that the high mobility group I(Y) protein binds to one of the DNase-I-protected areas and recruits another, yet unidentified, protein to the DD3 promoter in LNCaP cells.

Tong T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 1997; 47: 5-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar). When this carcinoma has locally or distantly spread, no curative therapy can be offered. Because there is no effective treatment available for patients with advanced and/or hormone-refractory prostate cancer, there is an urgent need to develop new approaches to treat patients with progressive prostate cancer. A better understanding of the molecular changes associated with the onset and progression of prostate cancer may provide a rational basis for the development of new treatment modalities. For example, gene therapy using prostate-specific gene promoters, i.e. linking up prostate-specific promoter sequences to genes that suppress tumor cell growth, induce apoptosis, and/or kill tumor cells, may provide a new way to attack this mordacious disease (2Boulikas T.

The promoter sequences responsible for the prostate-specific expression of these genes have been cloned, and the unraveling of their transcriptional regulation is ongoing and will provide prostate-specific promoter fragments that can activate therapeutic agents selectively in prostatic (cancer) cells.The PSA gene promoter has been most extensively studied and revealed the existence of a proximal prostate-specific promoter with an upstream prostate-specific enhancer that are both required for high, androgen-regulated activation of PSA expression (11Cleutjens K.B.J.M. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C.

The PSA enhancer-promoter was linked up to the HSV-tk gene, encoding a prodrug-converting enzyme, and was delivered by the human adenovirus into prostatic tumor cells growing subcutaneously in nude mice. As a result of the PSA promoter-driven HSV-tk expression, prostate tumor cell growth was significantly suppressed and life span of the animals was prolonged (16Gotoh A. Ko S.C. Shirakawa T. Cheon J.

This proof of principle opens the way for the application of promoter-based gene therapy for prostate cancer patients.Recently, we have cloned another human prostate-specific expressed gene, DD3 (18Bussemakers M.J.G. van Bokhoven A. Verhaegh G.W. Smit F.P. Karthaus H.F.M. Schalken J.A. Debruyne F.M.J. Ru N. Isaacs W.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5975-5979PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its prostate-specific mRNA expression, DD3 was shown to be highly overexpressed in prostatic tumors. These data indicated thatDD3 is one of the most prostate cancer-specific genes described. The prostate-specific DD3 expression and the sharp up-regulation in prostate cancer, suggest a unique transcriptional regulation. Consequently, the DD3 gene promoter becomes an interesting candidate to be used for the application of promoter-based gene therapy of prostate cancer patients.In this paper we describe the isolation of the DD3 5′-flanking sequences, and the identification of the proximal promoter that is required for the prostate-specific expression of DD3 mRNA. Furthermore, nuclear factor binding-sites in the DD3 promoter are identified, that may be important for the transcriptional regulation of the DD3 gene.DISCUSSIONThe DD3 gene was previously shown to be highly overexpressed in the majority of prostatic adenocarcinomas (18Bussemakers M.J.G. van Bokhoven A. Verhaegh G.W. Smit F.P. Karthaus H.F.M. Schalken J.A. Debruyne F.M.J. Ru N. Isaacs W.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5975-5979PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that DD3 mRNA expression is regulated by a unique prostate cancer-specific transcriptional mechanism. In this paper we have described the cloning and the initial characterization of the prostate cancer-specific DD3 gene promoter.Nucleotide sequence analysis did not reveal any obvious promoter elements. No known initiator motif, no TATA-box, no CAAT-box, and no GC-rich regions were found at consensus positions within the DD3 promoter. These canonical transcription factor binding sites are involved in the positioning of the transcription initiation complex. Interestingly, many TATA-less promoters initiate transcription at multiple start sites (reviewed in Ref. 28Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Some TATA-less promoters, on the other hand, initiate transcription from one or a few clustered start sites. These transcription initiation sites are encompassed by an initiator element, which contains all the necessary information for correct initiation of transcription (reviewed in Ref. 28Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The DD3 promoter initiates transcription mainly at a single site but so far lacks characterized initiator elements. A few promoters have been described that, like the DD3 promoter, are TATA-less and initiator-less and are not GC-rich (Ref. 29Brakebusch C. Jallal B. Fusco O. Iacobelli S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3674-3682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, and references therein). No further similarities to these gene promoters could be identified. Therefore, novel and tissue-specific cis-acting elements andtrans-acting transcription factors might define the specific and characteristic expression of DD3.We have shown that the 500-bp DD3 promoter region, encompassing the transcription start site, contains promoter activity upon transfection of reporter constructs into the DD3-expressing prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. The promoter activity increases 3-fold upon shortening of the 500-bp promoter fragment (Fig. 3, construct pDDGH-1.12versus -1.9), indicating the presence of a silencer in the DD3 proximal promoter. The activity of the pDDGH-1.12 DD3 promoter construct was restricted to the DD3-positive cell line LNCaP, as DD3-negative prostatic and non-prostatic cell lines only marginally initiated transcription from the DD3 promoter. These data suggest that the DD3 gene promoter is tissue and cell-type specific and, therefore, is a genuine prostate cancer-specific promoter. The absolute promoter activities of the DD3 promoter constructs tested, however, are rather low compared with the HSV-tk promoter activity. This correlates with the low level of endogenous DD3 mRNA expression observed in LNCaP cells, in contrast to the high DD3 expression in prostate cancer cells. Until now, we have found no other prostatic carcinoma cell lines that display high(er) DD3 expression levels; the expression of DD3 in the PC-346C cell line equals that of LNCaP cells.On the basis of the deletion analysis of the DD3 promoter (see above), the −433 to +62 region seems to contain most of thecis-acting elements necessary for DD3 expression. Therefore, we have analyzed the binding of nuclear factors to the DD3 promoter region by DNase-I footprint analysis and EMSA. DNase-I footprinting revealed three footprinted regions within the first 500 bp of the DD3 promoter. The first footprint, FP1, was found both in DD3-positive and DD3-negative cells. Nevertheless, a DD3-specific protein-DNA interaction was found in this region by EMSA (Fig. 6 A). This DD3-specific factor might represent one or more of the components of the transcription initiation complex, because the protein-DNA interaction occurs in the region (−29 to −63) where the transcription initiation complex is supposed to accumulate. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the NF-1 and E-box sequence motifs in FP1 are necessary for the activation of DD3 transcription. E-boxes are recognized by transcription factors belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, several of which are involved in tissue differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 30Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). However, antibodies against the bHLH E2A proteins did not affect the bandshifts observed with the FP1 oligonucleotide (data not shown). In addition, co-transfection of the HLH Id proteins, known antagonists of bHLH proteins (31Wilson R.B. Kiledjian M. Shen C.P. Benezra R. Zwollo P. Dymecki S.M. Desiderio S.V. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6185-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), together with the DD3 promoter constructs did not affect the activity of the latter constructs (data not shown). The most pronounced effect on DD3 transcription was observed using constructs mutated in the NF-1 motif (position −58 to −62). Nevertheless, antibodies against the human NF-1 protein family, did not supershift or abolish any of the bandshifts shown in Fig. 6 A (data not shown). These data indicate that the bHLH and NF-1 proteins are most probably not involved in the binding and regulation of DD3 transcription. Other factors might recognize and bind the NF-1 and E-box motif present in the DD3 promoter.Another footprint, FP2, was found further upstream at position −173 to −201 in the DD3 promoter. Mutation of this A+T-rich region, resulted in a decreased transcription rate, suggesting a positive role for this element in DD3 transcription. The high mobility group proteins I and Y (HMG-I(Y)) preferentially bind to the minor groove of A+T-rich sequences (27Solomon M.J. Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of HMG-I(Y) was shown to be up-regulated in prostate cancer cells and a significant correlation with tumor grade and stage was found (32Tamimi Y. van der Poel H.G. Denyn M.M. Umbas R. Karthaus H.F. Debruyne F.M. Schalken J.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5512-5516PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether HMG-I(Y) binds to the FP2 region in the DD3 promoter, and as such might be involved in the transcriptional regulation of DD3. Bandshift analysis using HMG-I(Y)-specific antibodies revealed that HMG-I(Y) interacts with DD3 promoter sequences in all prostate cancer cell lines studied. In addition, in the DD3-expressing cell lines LNCaP and PC-346C another unidentified factor is recruited to the HMG-I(Y)-DNA complex. Alternatively, a larger DNA-binding protein, antigenically similar to HMG-I(Y), may bind to the DD3 promoter instead of HMG-I(Y) itself. The DNA bending properties of HMG-I(Y) suggest that binding of HMG-I(Y) or HMG-I(Y)-like proteins could activate transcription initiation by altering the chromatin structure and/or by creating recognition sites for other trans-acting factors. DNA affinity purification methods will be approached to identify the protein(s) present in the slow migrating protein-DNA complex at FP2 of the DD3 promoter.In addition to HMG-I(Y), the second footprint harbors a very strong consensus motif for the FREAC-7/FKHL11 protein. FREAC-7 belongs to the forkhead/winged helix family of transcription factors (33Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerback S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Several of the forkhead-related factors are tissue-specifically expressed and regulate cell-specific transcription, e.g. freac-6/HFH-3 is expressed in the distal tubules of the kidney (34Overdier D.G.

No expression of freac-7 was reported in any adult human tissue (33Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerback S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Therefore, despite the presence of a strong FREAC-7 consensus binding site in the DD3 promoter, the role of FREAC-7 in the regulation of DD3 expression seems speculative.The putative silencer-containing region, position −132 to −366, was shown to lack promoter activity (Fig. 3, construct pDDGH-1.13). However, the cloning of fragments of the putative silencer (−132 to −254, −132 to −366, and −132 to −433) in front of the HSV-tk promoter did not reduce the HSV-tk promoter activity in transient transfection assays in LNCaP and TSU-pr1 cells (data not shown). This might indicate that, in contrast to the data from the promoter assays (Fig. 3), the DD3 promoter region from position −132 to −433 does not harbor a functional silencer. On the other hand, the (DD3-specific) silencer may not repress transcription of a heterologous promoter. Alternatively, multiple repressor binding sites may be required to repress transcription from such promoters, as has been demonstrated for other silencer elements (36Kaluz S. Kaluzova M. Opavsky R.

Such repressor complex may bind and inhibit the transcription initiation complex, the latter which most probably harbors one or more prostate-specific activators (like complex I in Fig. 6 A). For re-activation of transcription in vitro (LNCaP cells) or up-regulation of transcription in vivo (prostate cancer), specific mechanisms are required to overcome repression, such as inactivation of the repressor by mutation, transcriptional inactivation, binding of an inhibitor, or otherwise. Further studies are required to identify the nature of thetrans-acting factors that are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the DD3 gene in vitro. Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the Western male population (1Parker S.L. Tong T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 1997; 47: 5-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar). When this carcinoma has locally or distantly spread, no curative therapy can be offered. Because there is no effective treatment available for patients with advanced and/or hormone-refractory prostate cancer, there is an urgent need to develop new approaches to treat patients with progressive prostate cancer. A better understanding of the molecular changes associated with the onset and progression of prostate cancer may provide a rational basis for the development of new treatment modalities. For example, gene therapy using prostate-specific gene promoters, i.e. linking up prostate-specific promoter sequences to genes that suppress tumor cell growth, induce apoptosis, and/or kill tumor cells, may provide a new way to attack this mordacious disease (2Boulikas T. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 1471-1506PubMed Google Scholar, 3Taneja S.S. Pang S. Cohan P. Belldegrun A. Cancer Surv. 1995; 23: 247-266PubMed Google Scholar). A number of human genes have been identified that are specifically expressed in the human prostate, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA)1 (e.g. Ref.4Sokoll L.J. Chan D.W. Urol. Clin.

The promoter sequences responsible for the prostate-specific expression of these genes have been cloned, and the unraveling of their transcriptional regulation is ongoing and will provide prostate-specific promoter fragments that can activate therapeutic agents selectively in prostatic (cancer) cells. The PSA gene promoter has been most extensively studied and revealed the existence of a proximal prostate-specific promoter with an upstream prostate-specific enhancer that are both required for high, androgen-regulated activation of PSA expression (11Cleutjens K.B.J.M. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C.

The PSA enhancer-promoter was linked up to the HSV-tk gene, encoding a prodrug-converting enzyme, and was delivered by the human adenovirus into prostatic tumor cells growing subcutaneously in nude mice. As a result of the PSA promoter-driven HSV-tk expression, prostate tumor cell growth was significantly suppressed and life span of the animals was prolonged (16Gotoh A. Ko S.C. Shirakawa T. Cheon J.

This proof of principle opens the way for the application of promoter-based gene therapy for prostate cancer patients. Recently, we have cloned another human prostate-specific expressed gene, DD3 (18Bussemakers M.J.G. van Bokhoven A. Verhaegh G.W. Smit F.P. Karthaus H.F.M. Schalken J.A. Debruyne F.M.J. Ru N. Isaacs W.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5975-5979PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its prostate-specific mRNA expression, DD3 was shown to be highly overexpressed in prostatic tumors. These data indicated thatDD3 is one of the most prostate cancer-specific genes described. The prostate-specific DD3 expression and the sharp up-regulation in prostate cancer, suggest a unique transcriptional regulation. Consequently, the DD3 gene promoter becomes an interesting candidate to be used for the application of promoter-based gene therapy of prostate cancer patients. In this paper we describe the isolation of the DD3 5′-flanking sequences, and the identification of the proximal promoter that is required for the prostate-specific expression of DD3 mRNA. Furthermore, nuclear factor binding-sites in the DD3 promoter are identified, that may be important for the transcriptional regulation of the DD3 gene. DISCUSSIONThe DD3 gene was previously shown to be highly overexpressed in the majority of prostatic adenocarcinomas (18Bussemakers M.J.G. van Bokhoven A. Verhaegh G.W. Smit F.P. Karthaus H.F.M. Schalken J.A. Debruyne F.M.J. Ru N. Isaacs W.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5975-5979PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that DD3 mRNA expression is regulated by a unique prostate cancer-specific transcriptional mechanism. In this paper we have described the cloning and the initial characterization of the prostate cancer-specific DD3 gene promoter.Nucleotide sequence analysis did not reveal any obvious promoter elements. No known initiator motif, no TATA-box, no CAAT-box, and no GC-rich regions were found at consensus positions within the DD3 promoter. These canonical transcription factor binding sites are involved in the positioning of the transcription initiation complex. Interestingly, many TATA-less promoters initiate transcription at multiple start sites (reviewed in Ref. 28Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Some TATA-less promoters, on the other hand, initiate transcription from one or a few clustered start sites. These transcription initiation sites are encompassed by an initiator element, which contains all the necessary information for correct initiation of transcription (reviewed in Ref. 28Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The DD3 promoter initiates transcription mainly at a single site but so far lacks characterized initiator elements. A few promoters have been described that, like the DD3 promoter, are TATA-less and initiator-less and are not GC-rich (Ref. 29Brakebusch C. Jallal B. Fusco O. Iacobelli S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3674-3682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, and references therein). No further similarities to these gene promoters could be identified. Therefore, novel and tissue-specific cis-acting elements andtrans-acting transcription factors might define the specific and characteristic expression of DD3.We have shown that the 500-bp DD3 promoter region, encompassing the transcription start site, contains promoter activity upon transfection of reporter constructs into the DD3-expressing prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. The promoter activity increases 3-fold upon shortening of the 500-bp promoter fragment (Fig. 3, construct pDDGH-1.12versus -1.9), indicating the presence of a silencer in the DD3 proximal promoter. The activity of the pDDGH-1.12 DD3 promoter construct was restricted to the DD3-positive cell line LNCaP, as DD3-negative prostatic and non-prostatic cell lines only marginally initiated transcription from the DD3 promoter. These data suggest that the DD3 gene promoter is tissue and cell-type specific and, therefore, is a genuine prostate cancer-specific promoter. The absolute promoter activities of the DD3 promoter constructs tested, however, are rather low compared with the HSV-tk promoter activity. This correlates with the low level of endogenous DD3 mRNA expression observed in LNCaP cells, in contrast to the high DD3 expression in prostate cancer cells. Until now, we have found no other prostatic carcinoma cell lines that display high(er) DD3 expression levels; the expression of DD3 in the PC-346C cell line equals that of LNCaP cells.On the basis of the deletion analysis of the DD3 promoter (see above), the −433 to +62 region seems to contain most of thecis-acting elements necessary for DD3 expression. Therefore, we have analyzed the binding of nuclear factors to the DD3 promoter region by DNase-I footprint analysis and EMSA. DNase-I footprinting revealed three footprinted regions within the first 500 bp of the DD3 promoter. The first footprint, FP1, was found both in DD3-positive and DD3-negative cells. Nevertheless, a DD3-specific protein-DNA interaction was found in this region by EMSA (Fig. 6 A). This DD3-specific factor might represent one or more of the components of the transcription initiation complex, because the protein-DNA interaction occurs in the region (−29 to −63) where the transcription initiation complex is supposed to accumulate. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the NF-1 and E-box sequence motifs in FP1 are necessary for the activation of DD3 transcription. E-boxes are recognized by transcription factors belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, several of which are involved in tissue differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 30Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). However, antibodies against the bHLH E2A proteins did not affect the bandshifts observed with the FP1 oligonucleotide (data not shown). In addition, co-transfection of the HLH Id proteins, known antagonists of bHLH proteins (31Wilson R.B. Kiledjian M. Shen C.P. Benezra R. Zwollo P. Dymecki S.M. Desiderio S.V. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6185-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), together with the DD3 promoter constructs did not affect the activity of the latter constructs (data not shown). The most pronounced effect on DD3 transcription was observed using constructs mutated in the NF-1 motif (position −58 to −62). Nevertheless, antibodies against the human NF-1 protein family, did not supershift or abolish any of the bandshifts shown in Fig. 6 A (data not shown). These data indicate that the bHLH and NF-1 proteins are most probably not involved in the binding and regulation of DD3 transcription. Other factors might recognize and bind the NF-1 and E-box motif present in the DD3 promoter.Another footprint, FP2, was found further upstream at position −173 to −201 in the DD3 promoter. Mutation of this A+T-rich region, resulted in a decreased transcription rate, suggesting a positive role for this element in DD3 transcription. The high mobility group proteins I and Y (HMG-I(Y)) preferentially bind to the minor groove of A+T-rich sequences (27Solomon M.J. Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of HMG-I(Y) was shown to be up-regulated in prostate cancer cells and a significant correlation with tumor grade and stage was found (32Tamimi Y. van der Poel H.G. Denyn M.M. Umbas R. Karthaus H.F. Debruyne F.M. Schalken J.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5512-5516PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether HMG-I(Y) binds to the FP2 region in the DD3 promoter, and as such might be involved in the transcriptional regulation of DD3. Bandshift analysis using HMG-I(Y)-specific antibodies revealed that HMG-I(Y) interacts with DD3 promoter sequences in all prostate cancer cell lines studied. In addition, in the DD3-expressing cell lines LNCaP and PC-346C another unidentified factor is recruited to the HMG-I(Y)-DNA complex. Alternatively, a larger DNA-binding protein, antigenically similar to HMG-I(Y), may bind to the DD3 promoter instead of HMG-I(Y) itself. The DNA bending properties of HMG-I(Y) suggest that binding of HMG-I(Y) or HMG-I(Y)-like proteins could activate transcription initiation by altering the chromatin structure and/or by creating recognition sites for other trans-acting factors. DNA affinity purification methods will be approached to identify the protein(s) present in the slow migrating protein-DNA complex at FP2 of the DD3 promoter.In addition to HMG-I(Y), the second footprint harbors a very strong consensus motif for the FREAC-7/FKHL11 protein. FREAC-7 belongs to the forkhead/winged helix family of transcription factors (33Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerback S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Several of the forkhead-related factors are tissue-specifically expressed and regulate cell-specific transcription, e.g. freac-6/HFH-3 is expressed in the distal tubules of the kidney (34Overdier D.G. Ye H. Peterson R.S. Clevidence D.E. Costa R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13725-13730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and HNF-3 in hepatocytes and respiratory and intestinal epithelia (35Clevidence D.E. Overdier D.G.

However, the cloning of fragments of the putative silencer (−132 to −254, −132 to −366, and −132 to −433) in front of the HSV-tk promoter did not reduce the HSV-tk promoter activity in transient transfection assays in LNCaP and TSU-pr1 cells (data not shown).

However, the cloning of fragments of the putative silencer (−132 to −254, −132 to −366, and −132 to −433) in front of the HSV-tk promoter did not reduce the HSV-tk promoter activity in transient transfection assays in LNCaP and TSU-pr1 cells (data not shown). This might indicate that, in contrast to the data from the promoter assays (Fig. 3), the DD3 promoter region from position −132 to −433 does not harbor a functional silencer. On the other hand, the (DD3-specific) silencer may not repress transcription of a heterologous promoter. Alternatively, multiple repressor binding sites may be required to repress transcription from such promoters, as has been demonstrated for other silencer elements (36Kaluz S. Kaluzova M. Opavsky R.

Our data suggest that the binding of a prostate-specific repressor (complex) to the proximal DD3 promoter tightly regulates DD3 transcription. Such repressor complex may bind and inhibit the transcription initiation complex, the latter which most probably harbors one or more prostate-specific activators (like complex I in Fig. 6 A). For re-activation of transcription in vitro (LNCaP cells) or up-regulation of transcription in vivo (prostate cancer), specific mechanisms are required to overcome repression, such as inactivation of the repressor by mutation, transcriptional inactivation, binding of an inhibitor, or otherwise. Further studies are required to identify the nature of thetrans-acting factors that are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the DD3 gene in vitro.

The GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase (Graf) exhibits GAP activity toward the RhoA and Cdc42 GTPases, but is only weakly active toward the closely related Rac1. We determined the crystal structure of a 231-residue fragment of Graf (GrafGAP), a domain containing the GAP activity, at 2.4-Å resolution. The structure clarifies the boundaries of the functional domain and yields insight to the mechanism of substrate recognition. Modeling its interaction with substrate suggested that a favorable interaction with Glu-95 of Cdc42 (Glu-97 of RhoA) would be absent with the corresponding Ala-95 of Rac1. Indeed, GrafGAP activity is diminished ∼40-fold toward a Cdc42 E95A mutant, whereas a ∼10-fold increase is observed for a Rac1 A95E mutant. The GrafGAP epitope that apparently interacts with Glu-95(Glu-97) contains Asn-225, which was recently found mutated in some myeloid leukemia patients. We conclude that position 95 of the GTPase is an important determinant for GrafGAP specificity in cellular function and tumor suppression.

Ras-homology GTPase-activating protein p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside root mean square deviation The superfamily of small molecular weight G-proteins contains a subfamily of Ras-homology (Rho)1 proteins, which include RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 (1Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Rho proteins regulate multiple cellular processes, including diverse aspects of cytoskeletal organization and gene expression (2Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Improper mediation of these functions by Rho proteins is thought to play a fundamental role in human diseases such as hypertension and cancer (3Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T.

Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Like other family members, these proteins act as molecular switches by cycling between GDP- and GTP-bound states, in which the GTP-bound form activates intracellular signaling pathways, whereas the GDP-bound form is biologically inactive. Progression through the GDP/GTP cycle is promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which stabilize the nucleotide-free form (5Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and GAPs, which accelerate the enzymatic hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP (6Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). GAPs for GTPases of the Rho family (RhoGAPs) contain a ∼200-residue fragment known as the BH domain that is responsible for the GAP activity (7Musacchio A. Cantley L.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The general mechanism by which GAPs function can be inferred from structures of p50RhoGAP in complex with either RhoA (8Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Nurmahomed K. Owen D. Laue E.

Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) or Cdc42 (10Nassar N. Hoffman G.R. Manor D. Clardy J.C. Cerione R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The GAP donates the side chain of an arginine to the active site of the GTPase and stabilizes Gln-61 (Gln-63 for RhoA), orienting a water molecule properly for hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate (6Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although this “arginine-finger” is necessary, other interactions are also important for GAP activity. For example, the BH domain of p85PI3-kinase (BHPI3-K) contains the conserved arginine and binds Rho GTPases, but it does not possess GAP activity (7Musacchio A. Cantley L.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which GAPs down-regulate Rho GTPases is of fundamental interest, the means of substrate recognition is especially important. Cellular regulation requires selective activation of numerous pathways, and accordingly, wide substrate specificity is observed among RhoGAPs. Determining how different Rho GTPases are recognized by various GAPs is crucial to our understanding of regulatory cascades, but the structural determinants defining these preferences are not yet known (12Zhang B. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Graf is a multi-domain protein that binds focal adhesion kinase and influences cytoskeletal changes mediated by Rho proteins (13Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 14Taylor J.M. Macklem M.M. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 231-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the human Graf gene was found to be mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (15Borkhardt A. Bojesen S. Haas O.A. Fuchs U. Bartelheimer D. Loncarevic I.F. Bohle R.M. Harbott J. Repp R. Jaeger U. Viehmann S. Henn T. Korth P. Scharr D. Lampert F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9168-9173Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Graf contains a centrally located BH domain (GrafGAP), which displays a preference for Cdc42 and RhoA over Rac1 (13Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We recently reported the crystallization of avian GrafGAP (16Sheffield P.J. Derewenda U. Taylor J. Parsons T.J. Derewenda Z.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 356-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and now we describe its structure and new biochemical data regarding its substrate specificity. With greater than 95% sequence identity to the human GrafGAP, this structure provides a molecular basis for understanding the mechanism of tumor suppression by Graf. Because GrafGAP exhibits more stringent substrate preferences than the p50RhoGAP, we are able to identify a structural basis of substrate discrimination by GrafGAP, yielding an important addition to structures of p50RhoGAP and BHPI3-Kfor understanding molecular specificity in this family of signal transduction proteins. Moreover, this work sheds light on other RhoGAP proteins, including a closely related homolog of Graf, oligophrenin-1, a protein involved in X-linked mental retardation (17Billuart P. Bienvenu T. Ronce N. des Portes V. Vinet M.C. Zemni R. Crollius H.R. Carrie A. Fauchereau F. Cherry M. Briault S. Hamel B. Fryns J.P. Beldjord C. Kahn A. Moraine C. Chelly J. Nature. 1998; 392: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The recombinant GrafGAP protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and crystallized as described previously (16Sheffield P.J. Derewenda U. Taylor J. Parsons T.J. Derewenda Z.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 356-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, a purified glutathioneS-transferase fusion construct was cleaved with rTEV protease (Life Technologies), and the components were separated by Superdex 75-gel filtration chromatography. Purified protein at 8 mg/ml crystallized in 20–22% polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The x-ray diffraction data were generated using Cu Kα radiation and collected at room temperature with a RAXIS IV detector (Rigaku). The data exhibited the symmetry of space group P3121 or P3221, and the cell dimensions of a = 65.0 Å, c = 91.6 Å suggested there was one molecule per asymmetric unit. Because the initial data failed to yield a convincing molecular replacement solution, potential heavy atom derivatives were screened. Three useful derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals individually in stabilizing medium (25% polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) with either 1 mm PCMBS or 1 mm Baker's dimercurial reagent for 1 week, or 2.5 mm uranyl acetate for 24 h. Additionally, data from a native crystal (Native 1) was combined with data collected from a second native crystal using a DIP2000 detector (MacScience), yielding a data set (Native 2) more complete and redundant in the lower resolution ranges. All data were scaled and reduced using the HKL suite (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar), and intensities were converted to structure factor magnitudes using TRUNCATE (19Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). The Hg substructure for the PCMBS derivative was determined by SHELXS-97 (20Sheldrick G.M. Fortier S. Direct Methods for Solving Macromolecular Structures. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1998: 401-411Crossref Google Scholar) using isomorphous differences with native data, and the other derivatives were solved by difference Fourier techniques. Heavy atom parameters were refined using MLPHARE (19Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar), and the resulting phases to 3.3 Å were subjected to density modification and phase extension to 3.0 Å with DM (19Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Inspection of electron density maps from parallel calculations revealed the correct space group as P3121 rather than its polar mate. A molecular replacement solution consistent with the experimental maps was found using the main chain atoms of the p50RhoGAP structure (Protein Data Bank code: 1RGP, residues 63–232) and the Native 2 data with the program AMORE (19Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). All solutions from the rotation search (15–5.0 Å) were subjected to a translational search (15–5.0 Å) and, subsequently, to rigid body refinement (15–4.0 Å), yielding a correlation coefficient of 58.6 andR-factor of 50.0%, whereas the top values for a wrong solution were 49.9 and 54.0%, respectively. Calculations with BHPI3-K (PDB code: 1PBW, residues A129-A298) yielded similar results, but with a weaker signal-to-noise ratio. A model for refinement was constructed by trimming portions of the molecular replacement solution and adding side chains for residues that exhibited electron density in the experimentally phased map. This initial model constituted 60% of the atoms in the final refined structure. The model was refined in CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) using torsion-angle annealing with a maximum likelihood target toward the structure factor magnitudes of Native 1 data and the phase information encoded in the HL-coefficients output from MLPHARE. Electron density maps were calculated by combining experimental phases and sigmaa-weighted phases from the model, and the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) was used for model building. Solvent molecules were automatically identified from difference Fourier maps and added manually. The model was evaluated using the programs OOPS (23Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) during iterative cycles of rebuilding and refinement. Recombinant proteins were similarly expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusions inE. coli and prepared by established methods (25Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Rac1 A95E mutant was made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), by modifying a pGEX-4T vector encoding Rac1 and confirming the mutation by DNA sequencing. Constructs for other proteins were produced in former studies. The intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activities were measured using the nitrocellulose filter binding assay as described previously (12Zhang B. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The GTPases were preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP and incubated with reaction buffer in the presence or absence of GrafGAP. Reactions were terminated after 1 min by filtration through nitrocellulose filters, and the retentions of G-protein-bound radioactivity were quantified using a scintillation counter. The kinetics of the GTPase enhancement by GrafGAP were also performed and analyzed as previously published (12Zhang B. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the γPi release from GTP-loaded GTPases was measured using the continuous spectroscopic assay of a coupled MESG/phosphorylase system. The absorptions at 360 nm of the Pi-coupling reactions were monitored during the time course in a buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mmEDTA, 200 μm GTP, and 0.2 mm MESG) with 10 units of purine nucleoside phosphorylase at 20 °C, which provides a condition for the G-protein to undergo multiple turnover. At time zero, a final concentration of 5 mm MgCl2was added to initiate the single turnover reactions. The initial rates of GTP-hydrolysis monitored by γPi release were determined in the presence of a constant amount of GrafGAP and increasing concentrations of GTP-loaded enzymes. GrafGAP concentrations of 2, 10, and 100 nm were used for Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac1, respectively, and 50 nm was used for Cdc42 E95A and Rac1 A95E, all of which are within the linear ranges of the absorbance measurements. The GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis rates were fitted by nonlinear regression into the modified Michaelis-Menten equation to yield the Km and Vmax values of the reactions (12Zhang B. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The kcat values were calculated as Vmax/[GrafGAP], allowing the overall catalytic efficiencieskcat/Km to be derived. The structure of avian GrafGAP was determined by x-ray crystallography, using a combination of molecular replacement and heavy atom isomorphous replacement techniques, and was refined to a resolution of 2.4 Å (TableI). GrafGAP contains a bundle of nine α helices packed together in an anti-parallel arrangement (Fig. 1), assuming a fold similar to that of p50RhoGAP (26Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and BHPI3-K (7Musacchio A. Cantley L.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The overall similarity of these structures is implied by the successful molecular replacement solution used in the structure determination. Upon alignment of a core portion of the models containing the five central helices, the root mean square deviation of the displacement for 92 α-carbon atoms of GrafGAP compared with p50RhoGAP and BHPI3K is 0.88 Å and 1.03 Å, respectively, and slight displacements of the peripheral loops and helices are apparent (Fig. 2). The common overall fold was anticipated by sequence alignment (Fig. 2). GrafGAP shares approximately 25% identity to the sequences of p50RhoGAP and BHPI3-K over the common structural domain. Slightly higher sequence identity is shared with several other GAPs (e.g. 37% with β-chimaerin (13Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)), but the closest similarity is found with oligophrenin-1, sharing 55% identity with GrafGAP over the BH domain (17Billuart P. Bienvenu T. Ronce N. des Portes V. Vinet M.C. Zemni R. Crollius H.R. Carrie A. Fauchereau F. Cherry M. Briault S. Hamel B. Fryns J.P. Beldjord C. Kahn A. Moraine C. Chelly J.

The recombinant GrafGAP construct (residues 161–391) includes about 20 residues that are conserved between GrafGAP and oligophrenin-1 at the N terminus of the BH domain. The corresponding fragment in p50RhoGAP is ordered and has been considered an integral part of the BH domain. However, the first 30 residues are not evident in the electron density map, and consequently we believe that they are not ordered; the same is true of the final 10 residues. Thus, the ordered portion of the structure allows for a precise definition of the boundaries of the BH domain, comprising residues 191–381 (numbers based on full sequence of Graf). Notably, a GrafGAP construct truncated at these boundaries displays GAP activity unchanged from that exhibited by the crystallized protein (data not shown), further underscoring the compact architecture of this BH domain. Sequence similarity would suggest similar boundaries for the corresponding regions in oligophrenin-1 and closely related RhoGAPs. The ends of the BH domain in Graf are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions that differ in detail to those observed in other BH domain structures. Specifically, the N-terminal boundary is stabilized by the packing of Leu-193 between helices A, B, and E. This leucine adopts a similar arrangement as is found for Leu-49 in p50RhoGAP and Leu-118 in BHPI3K (numbering as in crystal structures (7Musacchio A. Cantley L.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)). However, the leucines in the latter structures belong to a helix preceding helix A, whereas the path of the main chain following Leu-193 of Graf leads directly into helix A, two residues away (Fig. 1). The C terminus of the BH domain is similarly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, whereby Ile-375 and Phe-376 firmly wedge helix H between helices D and E. These residues form interactions similar to those found for Leu-233 and Phe-234 in p50RhoGAP, but the corresponding local structure in BHPI3-K is stabilized differently. Two other regions with particular flexibility, showing no ordered structure in electron density maps, are the short loops located between helices A1 and B, and between helices F and G (Fig. 1). No known function can be assigned to the first disordered loop, but the second loop would be expected to become ordered upon binding a G-protein, because the corresponding region in p50RhoGAP is observed to form part of the structurally ordered interface in a complex with RhoA or Cdc42 (9Rittinger K.

Biol. 1998; 5: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Incidentally, this region in the structure of free p50RhoGAP is also disordered (26Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.

Graf was previously shown to have RhoGAP activity, displaying a preference for Cdc42 and RhoA over Rac1 (13Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This preference is confirmed and quantified by measurements of the kinetic parameters for the activity of GrafGAP (Table II). With micromolar values of Km, the overall catalytic efficiencykcat/Km of GrafGAP is ∼10-fold higher for Cdc42 than for RhoA, and about 1000-fold greater than for Rac1. Values obtained from these experiments compare well with those for p50RhoGAP in similar experiments toward Cdc42 and RhoA (12Zhang B. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the lower efficiency that GrafGAP exhibits toward Rac1 is reflected in both a higher Km and lowerkcat.Table IIKinetic parameters GrafGAP exhibits toward Rho GTPasesRho GTPaseKmVmaxkcatkcat/Kmμmμm/minmin−1μm−1 min−1Cdc423.06 ± 0.162.32 ± 0.031160 ± 15379.1RhoA3.99 ± 0.301.56 ± 0.09156 ± 939.1Rac111.8 ± 0.80.51 ± 0.055.1 ± 0.50.43Cdc42 E95A10.3 ± 1.94.46 ± 0.3883.6 ± 7.69.1Rac1 A95E5.56 ± 0.791.18 ± 0.0623.6 ± 1.24.2 Open table in a new tab To model the structural interactions between GrafGAP and substrate, the structure of GrafGAP was docked as a rigid body into a position occupied by p50RhoGAP bound to RhoA or Cdc42 in structures of the transition state complexes (Fig. 3). Many of the residues of p50RhoGAP at the interface with the GTPase are conserved between both GrafGAP and oligophrenin-1 (Fig. 2 B). The conserved “arginine-finger” in GrafGAP, Arg-220, is located close to the active site and would need to reorient slightly to attain a transition state configuration, a change also observed between the free and bound structures of p50RhoGAP (9Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The proximity of helix A1 of GrafGAP to helix α3 of the GTPase is also evident, and we noted the possibility for substrate discrimination by GrafGAP based on the type of amino acid found at position 95 of the GTPase (Glu-97 in RhoA). A glutamate residue conserved at this position in Cdc42 and RhoA appears to interact with the N terminus of helix A1 in GrafGAP. Specifically, an alternate side-chain rotamer places the negative charge of the glutamate close to two uncapped main-chain amides belonging to Asn-225 and Ser-226 of GrafGAP (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, the side chain of Asn-225 would also likely interact with the side chain of Glu-95(Glu-97) of the GTPase. These favorable interactions would be lost with Rac1, which has an alanine at the corresponding position (Fig. 3 C). The basis for the substrate specificity suggested by this modeling was tested by measuring the activity of GrafGAP toward the single-site mutants Cdc42 E95A and Rac1 A95E. Retention of γ-32P-labeled nucleotide by the GTPase in the presence of GrafGAP was assessed using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay (12Zhang B. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). GrafGAP activity toward Cdc42 E95A was reduced in comparison with wild-type, whereas GrafGAP activity toward Rac1 A95E was correspondingly increased (Fig. 4). To quantify these changes more carefully, we measured the kinetic parameters for these mutants. The overall catalytic efficiencykcat/Km for the Cdc42 E95A mutant was reduced ∼40-fold compared with wild-type, whereas that for the Rac1 A95E mutant was increased ∼10-fold above wild-type Rac1 (Table II). The dramatic effect of this single mutation is apparently due to direct changes in affinity for GrafGAP rather than secondary effects on GTPase activity, for the intrinsic GTPase activity of the mutants remains unchanged. Changes in Km observed between mutant and wild-type enzymes correspondingly indicate the glutamate side chain promotes interaction with GrafGAP. We conclude that the residue at position 95 of the GTPase forms an important determinant of substrate discrimination for GrafGAP. The importance of the interaction between helix A1 of GrafGAP and helix α3 of the GTPase is consistent with the general nature of the movement from the ground state (8Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Nurmahomed K. Owen D. Laue E. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 388: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) to the transition state (9Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) observed in GTPase complexes with p50RhoGAP (6Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A shift in the position of p50RhoGAP is observed, largely characterized as a 20° rigid-body rotation about the GTPase, resulting in helix A1 of p50RhoGAP dramatically moving 6 Å toward the helix α3 of the GTPase. In the transition state, Asn-94 and Glu-97 on helix α3 of RhoA form hydrogen bonds with p50RhoGAP, pulling the helix A1 loop close to the GTPase. Correspondingly, in the transition state complex with Cdc42, Asn-92 interacts with p50RhoGAP, but in this case Glu-95 of Cdc42 does not form a hydrogen bond across the interface. Although the interface includes interactions between helix A1 of p50RhoGAP and the helix α3 of the GTPase, the activity p50RhoGAP exhibits toward all Rho family GTPases suggests interaction(s) with residue 95 of the GTPase is relatively less important for p50RhoGAP activity than for GrafGAP. The configuration of the main chain leading into helix A1 in GrafGAP is similar to p50RhoGAP (Fig. 2) but is in striking contrast to that observed in the structure of BHPI3-K. Upon alignment with transition state structures, helix A1 of BHPI3-K is not capable of similar interactions with the GTPase. The reason BHPI3-K lacks GAP activity has been unclear, but was tentatively attributed to the lack of a conserved asparagine residue corresponding to Asn-194 in p50RhoGAP (6Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, we suggest that the loop preceding helix A1 simply does not allow the close apposition to the GTPase necessary for properly orienting the “arginine-finger” into the active site. The specific determinants important for binding and GAP activation, however, are expected to vary among GAPs. For example, kinetic experiments comparing the GAP activity of p190GAP and p50RhoGAP toward RhoA show a much greater salt dependence for the former than the latter, suggesting the greater importance of charged interactions for p190GAP than for p50RhoGAP (12Zhang B. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite the variation among the family of GAPs, the high degree of amino acid conservation between GrafGAP and oligophrenin-1 would suggest similar interactions with the GTPase. We surmise that the residue at position 95 of the GTPase might also partially explain an apparent preference of oligophrenin-1 for Cdc42 and RhoA over Rac1 (17Billuart P. Bienvenu T. Ronce N. des Portes V. Vinet M.C. Zemni R. Crollius H.R. Carrie A. Fauchereau F. Cherry M. Briault S. Hamel B. Fryns J.P. Beldjord C. Kahn A. Moraine C. Chelly J. Nature. 1998; 392: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Interestingly, new data support the role of tumor suppressor for Graf. In some myeloid leukemia patients, the Graf gene is fused to the mixed-lineage leukemia gene, losing the GAP domain (15Borkhardt A. Bojesen S. Haas O.A. Fuchs U. Bartelheimer D. Loncarevic I.F. Bohle R.M. Harbott J. Repp R. Jaeger U. Viehmann S. Henn T. Korth P. Scharr D. Lampert F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9168-9173Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The residual allele, potentially sufficient to suppress the syndrome, was found to contain mutations, one of which affects Asn-225 (15Borkhardt A. Bojesen S. Haas O.A. Fuchs U. Bartelheimer D. Loncarevic I.F. Bohle R.M. Harbott J. Repp R. Jaeger U. Viehmann S. Henn T. Korth P. Scharr D. Lampert F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9168-9173Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This residue, along with all the other residues that would interface with the GTPase, is conserved between the avian and human isoforms of GrafGAP. These observations reinforce our conclusion that the Asn-225 containing epitope of GrafGAP is critical for its biological function, which is proper selection of the target GTPase. The overall preference GrafGAP exhibits in vitro differs from that observed recently in vivo. Although our data would suggest that Cdc42 is the preferred substrate of Graf, the cytoskeletal changes induced by Graf in vivo are processes thought to be dependent specifically upon RhoA and not Cdc42 (14Taylor J.M. Macklem M.M. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 231-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This would suggest Graf has some other means of distinguishing G-proteins in vivo in addition to the specificity determinant we identify here. The present study addresses the specificity inherent to the GrafGAP domain and does not account for any additional substrate selectivity based on other factors, such as subcellular localization or additional interactions occurring outside the BH domain. These results reveal novel structural features for the regulation of Rho GTPases by Graf and yield insight to the molecular properties of oligophrenin-1 and other related GAPs."

Titration experiments with SOS reveals that the ligand binds specifically to the C-terminal domain of the protein in a 1:1 ratio. Binding of SOS to hFGF-1 is found to induce a subtle conformational change in the protein. Significant conformational exchange (R<sub>ex</sub>) is observed for several residues in the free form of the protein. However, in the SOS-bound form only three residues exhibit significant R<sub>ex</sub> values, suggesting that the dynamics on the micro- to millisecond time scale in the free form is coupled to the <i>cis-trans</i>-proline isomerization. hFGF-1 is a rigid molecule with an average generalized parameter (S<sup>2</sup>) value of 0.89 ± 0.03.

The protein regulates availability of the drug by proper release of the biologically active chromophore. To understand the physiological mechanism of the drug delivery system, we have examined the trifluoroethanol (TFE)-induced conformational changes of the protein with special emphasis on their relation to the release of the chromophore from holoneocarzinostatin. The effect of the α helix-inducing agent, TFE, on all the β-sheet neocarzinostatin proteins was studied by circular dichroism, fluorescence, and1H NMR studies.

The native state is stable until 20% TFE and is half-converted into the intermediate state at 30% TFE, which starts to collapse beyond 50%. High pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of the release of the chromophore caused by TFE treatment at 0 °C suggests that the release process, which occurs below 20% TFE, does not result from an observable conformational change in the protein. Kinetic measurements of the release of chromophore at 25 °C reveal that TFE does stimulate the rate of release, which increases sharply at 15% and reaches a maximum at 20% TFE, although no major secondary or tertiary structural change of the carrier protein is observed under these same conditions. Our data suggest that chromophore release results from a fluctuation of the protein structure that is stimulated by TFE. Complete release of the chromophore occurs at TFE concentrations where no overall observable unfolding of the apoprotein is seen.

One important pharmacological function is that the protein regulates availability of the drug by proper release of its biologically potent chromophore. To understand the physiological mechanism of the natural drug delivery system, it is interesting and essential to study how the protein releases the tightly bound chromophore. The release of some small ligands such as dinitrophenyl (4Posner R.G. Lee B. Conrad D.H. Holowka D. Baird B. Goldstein B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5350-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or NADH (5Blackwell L.F. Motion R.L. MacGibbon A.K.H. Hardman M.J. Buckley P.D. Biochem.

The results show that the physiological mechanism of releasing a noncovalently bound cofactor from a protein complex can be triggered by a specific contact with some agent in the cell, for example, the anion-mediated iron release mechanism of transferrins (7Mizutani K. Yamashita H. Mikami B. Hirose M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3258-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Alternatively, dissociation can also be caused by a spontaneous fluctuation of the protein conformation. The release of heme from myoglobin provides a good example (8La Mar G.N. Davis N.L. Parish D.W. Smith K.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Lecomte J.T.J. Johnson R.D. La Mar G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 829: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Currently, the molecular mechanism by which holoNCS1 releases its chromophore is unclear. Initially, we wished to determine whether the protein needs to be unfolded for the release process. Neocarzinostatin (NCS) is the first enediyne chromoprotein; it consists of a labile chromophore (NCS-Chr) (Mr = 659, Fig. 1) (10Ishida N. Miyazaki K. Kumagai K. Rikimaru M. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo ). 1965; 18: 68-76PubMed Google Scholar, 11Edo K. Mizugaki M. Koide Y. Seto H. Furihata K. Otake N. Ishida N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 331-334Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar) that is tightly and noncovalently bound to an apoprotein (apoNCS) (113 amino acids) (12Goldberg I.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1991; 24 (and references therein): 191-198Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The chromophore, with an unusual bicyclic dienediyne structure, is very potent in causing DNA damage. Upon cycloaromatization to a reactive radical intermediate, it abstracts hydrogens from the sugar moiety of DNA. Although apoNCS itself is inactive in inducing cleavage of DNA, it plays an important role in the drug action by protecting and storing the labile chromophore and by releasing the chromophore to the target DNA. It is of particular interest that NCS protein does not bind to DNA (13Maeda H. Aikawa S. Yamashita A. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 554-559PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jung G. Kohnlein W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There is evidence showing that release of the chromophore occurs before NCS interacts with DNA (14Jung G. Kohnlein W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); DNA cleavage is believed to occur when the chromophore becomes activated after it is already intercalated into the DNA (12Goldberg I.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1991; 24 (and references therein): 191-198Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar). HoloNCS thus regulates the availability of the drug by properly controlling the release of its bound chromophore. The biologically active chromophore has a very high affinity for its apoNCS (Kd∼10−10m) (12Goldberg I.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1991; 24 (and references therein): 191-198Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar). How holoNCS regulates the release of the tightly bound chromophore is completely unknown. It has been reported earlier that DNA cleavage induced by native NCS can be greatly stimulated by organic solvents and denaturants in vitro (14Jung G. Kohnlein W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Kappen L.S. Goldberg I.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 2959-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Kappen L.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5647-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This effect might well result from a denaturation process that releases the active chromophore. The primary structure of apoNCS (Fig. 1) was first proposed in the early 70s (17Meienhofer J. Maeda H. Glaser C.B. Czombos J. Kuromizu K.

The three-dimensional structure is almost superimposable on that of holoprotein, as determined by x-ray crystallography (23Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. Samy T.S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 68: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Wilson K. Kuromizu K. Eur. J.

Science. 1993; 262: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and NMR (26–37) studies. The only noteworthy difference between holo- and apoprotein is the position of the aromatic ring of the side chain of certain aromatic residues such as Phe78. The protein has two disulfide bridges and is kidney-shaped with two domains that hold a well defined binding cavity. The larger domain forms a seven-stranded antiparallel β-barrel, and the smaller domain consists of two antiparallel strands of β-sheet that are perpendicular to each other. Early chemical studies indicate that the first 20 amino acids do not associate with the active chromophore (38Samy T.S.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5573-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues that form the hydrophobic binding pocket were assigned later by three-dimensional structural studies (23–37, 39Hirama M. Tanaka T. Pure Appl. Chem. 1994; 66: 791-796Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Owing to its labile nature, after the chromophore molecule is released it quickly becomes inactivated, and only a few percent reach and cleave the target DNA (40Chin D.-H. Goldberg I.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9341-9342Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although adding apoNCS can prevent inactivation, it also inhibits the release of the active chromophore (16Kappen L.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5647-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Apparently, a proper physiological timing of the releasing process plays an important role in the drug efficacy. On the other hand, although NCS is very potent against tumor cells, it damages normal cells as well (41Goldberg I.H. Povirk L.F. Kappen L.S. Chin D.-H. Ebashi S. Cellular Regulation and Malignant Growth. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1985: 483-492Google Scholar). Understanding the release process of NCS could help to find a more selective delivery system that would facilitate the release of NCS-Chr only in specified conditions, as suggested by Ehrlich's idea of turning potential drugs into “magic bullets” (42Johnson J.P. Dippold W.G. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1989; 115: 494-495Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To perform its biological activity, the chromophore needs to be released by somehow perturbing its strong affinity for the binding cavity that is formed by the all-β-sheet apoNCS. Hydrophobic molecules may play a perturbing role in regulating the release of NCS-Chr. The penetration of [14C]NCS into cell nuclei based on autoradiography was demonstrated in 1975 (13Maeda H. Aikawa S. Yamashita A. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 554-559PubMed Google Scholar), which is before the discovery of the chromophore. The active chromophore is probably released either inside the cell nucleus or on the nuclear membrane. Simple organic co-solvents such as alcohols might effectively mimic the nonpolar cellular environment of the nuclear membrane. The α-helicogenic solvent, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), is a useful hydrophobic solvent, which mixes readily with water, and it might be effective in inducing a conformational change of the all β-sheet apoNCS. Therefore, we determine whether TFE induces a conformational change in apoNCS, and if so, whether the conformational change is correlated with chromophore release. NCS powder was obtained from Kayaku Laboratories Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The stock solution in water (0.87 mm) was stored in aliquots at −80 °C in the dark. The apoNCS stock solution (0.13 mm) was prepared in a mixed buffer of 2.67 mmammonium acetate (pH 5) and 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5). TFE and 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) were obtained from Merck and Sigma, respectively. 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol-d3 was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. All solutions were prepared in 18.2 ohm of Milli-Q water, and the concentration of TFE was expressed as percentage of volume to volume. All CD measurements were carried out on a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter. The instrument was calibrated with ammonium d-10-camphor sulfonate. The results are expressed as mean residue ellipticity, [θ], which is defined as [θ] = θobs/(113 × l ×c), where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees; c is the concentration in dmol per liter;l is the length of the light path in cm, and the constant 113 is the number of residues in apoNCS. The scan speed was 200 nm/min. The CD spectra, which are averaged from more than three scans, were measured with 10 μm (final concentration) apoNCS containing requisite amounts (v/v) of TFE. A 1-mm quartz cell (about 300 μl) was used for far-UV region (190–250 nm) and 10-mm micro cell (about 70 μl) for near-UV (240 to 320 nm) measurements. All spectra were recorded at 25 ± 2 °C and corrected for solvent and buffer blanks. A Hitachi model F-4500 fluorescence spectrofluorimeter was used for measuring the effect of TFE on the fluorescence of NCS. A set of solutions (total volume, 250 μl) containing the requisite amounts (v/v) of TFE was mixed with 5–10 μm (final concentration) apoNCS. A rectangular micro cell (4 × 10 mm) was used for measurements. The fluorescent emission spectra were recorded at the light path of 10 mm between 290 and 500 nm with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. All spectra were corrected with solvent and buffer backgrounds. The resolution was 1.0 nm, and wavelength accuracy was within ± 2 nm. ANS binding studies were also carried out by Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter. A set of solutions was prepared as described previously except that apoNCS concentration was increased to 10–50 μm due to lower sensitivity. ANS was added at 10:1 molar ratio to apoNCS, and the total volume was 300 μl. The fluorescent emission spectra were recorded between 375 and 625 nm with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm. All spectra were corrected with ANS, solvent, and buffer backgrounds. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Varian 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. About 2 mg of apoNCS was dialyzed against pure water and lyophilized to dryness before dissolving it into a mixture of H2O/D2O (9:1) containing requisite amounts (v/v) of TFE-d3. The pH of the unbuffered solution was at 5. Cycloaromatization reactions were assayed by Waters Millennium multisystems including model 600E solvent delivery system, model 996 photodiode array detector, and a model 474 fluorescence detector. The rate of multiwavelength measurement of photodiode array detector was 0.25 spectrum/s with 1.2 nm of resolution. The fluorescent excitation was 340 nm, and emission was detected at 440 nm with bandwidth of 40 nm. Separations were performed by a Waters μ-Bondapak reverse phase C18 column (particle size, 10 μm; pore size, 125 Å; 0.39 × 30 cm) with a 0.4-cm long guard column. The gradient was composed of 5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4, in H2O/CH3OH with increasing concentrations of methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The typical gradient started from a sharp increase 0–48% of methanol in 3 min and then a shallow linear increase to 80% in 62 min. A set of 10 μm (final concentration) holoNCS solutions in 5 mm (final concentration) of ammonium acetate (pH 4) was mixed with 5 mm (final concentration) of GSH and Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 7.0). Requisite percentage of TFE was added (final volume, 100 μl) to facilitate the release of the chromophore. After 5 min of incubation at 0 °C, the remaining intact chromophore that had been bound to the protein was analyzed by HPLC. The elution of NCS-Chr was detected at 45 ± 2 min. Injections were done manually to ensure that the full amount of each solution was completely loaded. The rate of release of NCS-Chr from holoNCS was monitored by fluorescent changes measured with a Hitachi-F 4500 spectrofluorimeter. A set of solutions of 2.5–5 μm(final concentration) of holoNCS in 100 mm (final concentration) of Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) was mixed with 5 mm(final concentration) of GSH. The release of NCS-Chr was initiated by adding the requisite amount of TFE to the mixture (total volume, 300 μl) in a rectangular micro cell (4 × 10 mm). The sample temperature was controlled by a thermostatic cell holder equipped with a thermostatic circulator. Excitation was set at 340 nm at the 4-mm light path, and emission was recorded at 440 nm at the 10-mm light path. Because Time Scan Mode does not provide light shutter control function, which can lead to the light-induced degradation of NCS-Chr, a repetitive Wavelength Scan Mode with the shutter closed between each run was used. The wavelength interval was set at the minimum (10 nm, from 434 to 444 nm) with a scan rate of 1000 nm per min. The total light exposure time to the light-sensitive NCS sample was thus minimized to 36 s for an experiment that recorded data per min and monitored in 1 h. Measurement continued until the change of emission at 440 nm reached a plateau, which indicates that the reaction of the released chromophore has gone to completion. The change in [holoNCS] with time was determined by increases of the fluorescent emission resulting from the thiol-induced drug product. Because the calibration curve shows a linear relation in the drug concentration range studied, the measured fluorescent emission in mV was directly converted into the concentration of the remaining intact chromophore that was bound to the protein by Equation 1:[holoNCS]=[holoNCS] o−(Ft/(F∞−Fo))×[holoNCS] oEquation 1 where Ft is the measured fluorescent emission in mV at 440 nm at time t; Fo is the initial reading after TFE was added; and F∞ is the plateau reading after the reaction was completed. CD spectra were recorded at both near- and far-UV to monitor the conformational changes induced by titration of TFE. Within reasonable experimental errors, the CD spectrum of the native apoNCS (data not shown) is essentially consistent with one published recently (3Heyd B. Lerat G. Adjadj E. Minard P. Desmadril M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It shows a broad negative signal from 300 to 250 nm ([θ]280 ≅ −0.6 × 103) followed by a positive peak around 225 nm ([θ]225 ≅ 0.2 × 103) and a negative one centered at 212 nm ([θ]212 ≅ −1 × 103), indicative of the secondary structure being predominantly β-sheet. The near-UV CD signal in proteins is believed to stem from aromatic side chains in the protein that have restricted motions, because of interactions with neighboring residues in the tertiary structure of the protein. In the case of apoNCS, the near-UV CD signal is centered on 280 nm. Fig. 2 a shows the change in [θ] at 280 nm with TFE. Below 20% TFE, very little change of the tertiary structure is observed. As the TFE concentration increases above 20%, the mean residue ellipticity gradually increases with increase of the TFE concentration. The signals beyond 50% TFE are randomly scattered, because of the inherent nature of the relatively low intensity. The results suggest that considerable loss of the tertiary structural interactions in the protein occurs only above 20% TFE. For the CD spectra in the far-UV region, addition of TFE up to 30% (v/v) appears to have no significant effect on the characteristic line features of apoNCS, although both [θ]225 and [θ]212 start to drop beyond 25% TFE to become less positive and more negative. Beyond 30%, the CD spectrum in the far-UV region, which monitors secondary structural transitions in proteins, shows a steep decrease in negative ellipticity in the region around 206–222 nm. A large negative signal centered at 206 nm becomes obvious ([θ]206 ≅ −4 × 103) in 35% of TFE. Its intensity increases sharply with the increase of TFE content. Whereas it becomes about doubly intense at 45% TFE (compared with 35%) ([θ]206 ≅ −8 × 103), a broad negative shoulder also appears around 222 nm ([θ]222≅ −5 × 103). Such TFE-induced changes in spectra, which are close to helical spectra, are rather typical. Fig. 2 b shows the change in [θ] at 215 nm, which is correlated with the conformational change of β-pleated backbone structure of apoNCS. The ellipticity value shows no significant change up to 25% TFE. Comparing the change at 215–280 nm, this result implies that the loss of tertiary structure may precede the transformation of the secondary structure induced by TFE. It is noteworthy to point out that an interesting shoulder appears around 45–50% TFE, suggesting that a stable intermediate or partially structured state forms on the way to unfolding. Presumably it is a chiefly helical state, based on its CD spectrum. The change in tryptophan emission of apoNCS upon addition of TFE was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. When excited at 280 nm, the emission maximum occurs at 346 nm with a slight red shift at higher TFE concentration (348 nm in 60% of TFE). Fig. 3 aillustrates the change in the intensity of the fluorescence emission maximum with TFE. It is evident that the TFE treatment of NCS results in a marked loss of its fluorescence properties. Unlike CD spectra, which show no significant change until the amount of TFE is greater than 20% (near-UV) or 25% (far-UV), the TFE-induced fluorescent change becomes obvious at low concentrations (<20%). This result implies that the steric orientation of the aromatic side chain of the tryptophan residues may have changed, possibly because of hydrophobic interaction with TFE even at low TFE concentrations, although both the global and backbone skeleton of apoNCS still remain intact, based on CD data. It is very interesting to observe marginal but very clear increases of the fluorescence, starting from 30% TFE and reaching a maximum around 45–50%. These changes correspond very well with the observed shoulder in the change of the ellipticity at 215 nm. This result further supports the possible formation of a partially structured state induced by TFE. It has been shown that ANS, a fluorescent hydrophobic probe, has a stronger affinity for the molten globule intermediate than for the native protein or fully unfolded state (43Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar). We carried out ANS binding studies with TFE-treated and -untreated NCS protein. Fig. 3 b illustrates the TFE-induced changes of the intensity and the wavelength at the maximum emission of the fluorescence from ANS. Both changes are closely correlated with each other. The wavelength of maximum emission (λmax) of ANS exhibits a significant blue shift beyond 20% TFE (∼10 nm apart from 20 to 80% TFE). Beyond 20% TFE, the fluorescence also markedly increases to its maximum value at around 45–50% TFE, which corresponds to the shoulder region in the change of the wavelength of maximum intensity. Above 50% TFE the fluorescence gradually drops back to the initial values beyond 80% TFE. This result suggests that the tightly folded hydrophobic binding site of apoNCS can remain inaccessible to ANS molecules until 20% TFE, which is consistent with the observed tertiary structural changes analyzed from the ellipticity changes at 280 nm. Higher concentrations of TFE (20–50%) relax the closely packed binding pocket into a stable partial structure. The partially opened structure increases the accessibility of hydrophobic sites for ANS binding. Excess TFE (50–80%) unfolds the hydrophobic binding cavity completely, and the protein loses the ability to bind ANS. The stable partial structure with high ANS binding affinity is a characteristic feature of the molten globule state. It is noteworthy that a molten globule-like state is observed from the study of ANS binding in 45–50% TFE, which is consistent with the stable intermediate observed from the ellipticity change at 215 nm, as well as from the fluorescence change of tryptophan emission. ApoNCS has been studied by sequential one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy in solvents that contain requisite amounts of TFE-d3. Fig. 4 illustrates the spectra. For the native form of apoNCS, the NMR lines are relatively narrow and show relatively good dispersion, which reflects the specific inter-residue interactions within the compact folded protein structure. Some line broadening is observed as the TFE concentration increases. The chemical shift changes induced by TFE are particularly evident in the aromatic region (6.5–7.5 ppm). Compared with the native state, the change induced by 10% TFE is already evident. This result is consistent with the observation from a fluorescence study using tryptophan emission. Apparently, the hydrophobic effect from even a small quantity of TFE is powerful enough to disturb the interaction or steric orientation of the aromatic side chain of nonpolar residues, whereas no major effect is observed on the secondary or tertiary structure of the protein under the same condition. Up to 20% TFE, the changes in NMR resonance signals can be monitored. Beyond that, large changes are observed. The spectrum of apoNCS in 40% TFE is drastically different from the one in native state and in 80%, in which the NMR spectrum shows that the protein is totally denatured. Once NCS-Chr is released from its protector protein, it becomes very labile and can barely be detected by aqueous chromatographic analysis. Furthermore, because the carrier protein can easily be denatured by a hydrophobic mobile phase such as methanol or acetonitrile in conventional reverse phase HPLC, it is technically difficult to distinguish whether or not the detected NCS-Chr has been released form TFE treatment. We have previously used GSH to distinguish qualitatively the bound NCS-Chr from the released form (44Chin D.-H. Tseng M.-C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 2891-2894Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 45Chin D.-H. Chem. Eur. J. 1999; 5: 1084-1090Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). GSH fails to interact with the bound form because of negative charge repulsion from the NCS protein, but it can effectively induce cycloaromatization of the enediyne nucleus of the unbound NCS-Chr to form an adduct (40Chin D.-H. Goldberg I.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9341-9342Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). By adding GSH, all released NCS-Chr induced by TFE is inactivated by GSH, whereas the intact bound NCS-Chr can be detected by the established reverse phase chromatographic and spectroscopic methods (46Chin D.-H. Tseng M.-C. Chuang T.-C. Hong M.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 demonstrates the analyzed percentage of the remaining bound NCS-Chr by HPLC from 1 nmol of holoNCS that was incubated with 5 mm GSH at 0 °C. The incubation time was set at 5 min to facilitate the chromophore release, which is about the required minimum time for running a single spectroscopic spectrum to observe any conformational change of apoNCS. The results reveal that the percentage of chromophore release increases with TFE concentration until about 40% TFE. The nonlinear behavior at higher TFE concentrations probably occurs because of hydrophobic protection of the labile NCS-Chr, which reduces the rate of inactivation by GSH. Comparing the efficiency of TFE in causing chromophore release with that in causing the protein conformational change, it is apparent that the effect of TFE on the release of the chromophore is not correlated with the change of the backbone or tertiary structures of the protein. At 20% TFE, about 40% NCS-Chr is released within 5 min at 0 °C,"

Nine isoforms of the enzyme have been detected, and they display characteristic regulatory properties and patterns of cellular distribution (1Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 2Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Cellular rates of cyclic AMP synthesis are controlled by a variety of extracellular ligands that interact with heptahelical receptors in the plasma membrane. Relevant receptors can either stimulate cyclic AMP synthesis, usually via the intermediacy of a G protein1 (Gs) that activates adenylyl cyclase, or inhibit cyclic AMP synthesis, often by interaction with an inhibitory G protein, Gi. Mammalian adenylyl cyclases can also be activated by the diterpene forskolin (3Seamon K.B. Padgett W. Daly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar) and inhibited by certain adenosine analogs and adenine nucleotides called P-site inhibitors (4Londos C. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Certain adenylyl cyclases are also regulated by Ca2+, Ca2+-calmodulin, and phosphorylation (5Smit M.J. Iyengar R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian adenylyl cyclases are integral membrane proteins that appear to contain two sets of six membrane-spanning helices that are separated by a large (∼40 kDa) cytoplasmic loop and followed by a similarly sized carboxyl-terminal cytosolic domain (6Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.-J. Feinstein P.G. Orth K. Slaughter C. Reed R.R. Gilman A.G. Science. 1989; 244: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The cytosolic domains, termed C1 and C2, have been extensively studied; they are responsible for catalytic activity and most of the regulatory properties of the enzymes (7Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The first 200–250 amino acids of each cytosolic domain, designated C1a and C2a, are the most highly conserved regions among adenylyl cyclases. Strikingly, the C1a and C2a domains are approximately 50% similar and 25% identical to each other within a single isoform of adenylyl cyclase, and they are 20–25% similar to the catalytic domains of membrane-bound and cytosolic guanylyl cyclases. The C1a and C2a domains of adenylyl cyclases can be expressed separately and purified as recombinant proteins. When mixed together, they display the characteristics of membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase with respect to regulation by Gsα, Giα, forskolin, and P-site inhibitors (8Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G.

Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) have provided detailed insights into mechanisms of catalysis of cyclic AMP synthesis and regulation of the activity of the enzyme. Less information is available about the biochemical and structural properties of low activity states of adenylyl cyclase. Crystallization of the C1 and C2 domains in the absence of Gsα and/or forskolin would permit structural comparison of high and low activity states of the enzyme. We have approached this goal with a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques. Full-length mammalian adenylyl cyclase was introduced into a mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that does not express the endogenous enzyme. Co-expression of the mammalian protein together with Gsα relieves dependence of cyclic AMP for growth at non-permissive temperatures. We have utilized a genetic screen to isolate constitutively active mutants of adenylyl cyclase within this strain. We describe the isolation of several partially active mutants, as well as the biochemical consequences of these mutations in the context of the soluble, recombinant adenylyl cyclase system. To achieve high level constitutive expression of type II adenylyl cyclase (ACII) in yeast, a 0.94-kb fragment containing the S. cerevisiae PGK1 promoter and a 3.3-kb fragment encoding rat ACII (PCR-amplified from a template plasmid provided by Randall Reed, The John Hopkins University) were subcloned into pRS425 (13Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). The resulting expression plasmid, Cp1512 (genotype LEU2 PGK1p-ACII 2μ-ori REP3 bla), was used as the template for error-prone PCR amplification of two separate fragments as follows: nucleotides 5514–6384, which encode the C1a domain, and nucleotides 7033–8264, which encode the C2a domain (primer sequence available upon request). The mutagenized fragments encoding the C1a domain were then used to transform yeast strain TC41F2-1 (genotype MATa cyr1::ura3 cam1 cam2 cam3 leu2-3 leu2-112 his3-532 his4 ura3; provided by Warren Heideman, University of Wisconsin) along with a “gapped” vector prepared as follows. Cp1512 was digested with ApaI (which cuts at nucleotide 5682 of ACII) andDraIII (which cuts at nucleotide 6254), and the 10.1-kb fragment, which lacks the C1a coding sequence, was isolated. Similarly, TC41F2-1 was co-transformed with mutagenized fragments encompassing the C2a domain and a gapped vector prepared as follows. Cp1512 was digested with PvuII (which cuts at nucleotide 7111) and BamHI (which cuts at nucleotide 8168), and the 9.7-kb fragment, which lacks the C2a coding region, was isolated. For both transformations, cells were plated on SC-Leu (14Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) without supplemental cyclic AMP and incubated at room temperature. Colonies from these plates were replica-plated to SC-Leu plates and incubated at 34 °C. Colonies that grew at 34 °C were expected to harbor stably replicating episomes that result from in situ recombination between the gapped vector and a PCR-amplified fragment and that, as a result of this recombination, express an adenylyl cyclase that has constitutive (i.e. Gsα-independent) activity. In all cases, the plasmid dependence of growth under selective conditions (on SC-Leu at 34 °C) was further tested by allowing spontaneous loss of plasmid under non-selective conditions (on YEPD with supplemental cyclic AMP at 30 °C), followed by re-testing under selective conditions. Plasmids were rescued from those colonies whose growth under selective conditions was dependent on plasmid; the plasmids were then reintroduced into naive host strain TC41F2-1, and the transformants were tested for growth on SC-Leu at 34 and at 37 °C. All plasmids reported here confer plasmid-dependent growth at 34 °C when introduced into TC41F2-1. The mutants that appeared to confer the highest level of constitutive activity in yeast were analyzed using the soluble mammalian adenylyl cyclase system.

The mutations in the C1a domain were made in the conserved residues in the C1a domain from canine type V adenylyl cyclase corresponding to the mutations in the rat type IIC1 domain obtained from the yeast screen. The mutations in the C2domain from the yeast screen were made in the C2 domain of rat type II adenylyl cyclase using the vector pQE60-IIC2-H6. The vector pQE60-ArgC-IIC2 was used to generate a non-tagged IIC2-K1014N. Sequences of synthetic mutagenic sense and antisense primers are available upon request. Wild type and mutant H6-VC1(591)FLAG and IIC2-H6 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (8Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured as described by Smigel (16Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were performed in a volume of 100 μl for 10 min at 30 °C. The final concentration of MgCl2 was 10 mm. The concentration of ATP was 1 mm unless otherwise stated. Kinetic constants were determined by varying MgATP from 20 μm to 5 mm with a fixed excess of Mg2+. Unless otherwise stated, assays contained a limiting concentration of VC1 and an excess of IIC2 for both wild type and mutant assays. All specific activities reported are with respect to the concentration of the limiting domain. Each experiment was repeated two to three times. Proteins (Gsα and adenylyl cyclase domains) were separated by fast protein liquid chromatography with tandemly arranged Superdex 75 and 200 (HR10/30) columns. Proteins were eluted in a buffer containing 20 mm NaHepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl. Flow rates were 0.2 ml/min, and 300-μl fractions were collected. An aliquot of each fraction (15 μl) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% acrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. H6-VC1(591)FLAG (15 μm) and ArgC-IIC2 wild type or K1014N (75 μm) were incubated on ice for 15 min in 150 μl of buffer A (20 mm NaHepes, pH 8.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl) in the presence or absence of 100 μm forskolin, 100 μm 2′d,3′-AMP and 100 μmPPi. The mixture was applied to a 25-μl metal chelate column (TalonTM, CLONTECH) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed twice with 100 μl of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm forskolin, 100 μm 2′d,3′-AMP, and 100 μm PPi). The column was then eluted with 100 μl of buffer B containing 100 mm imidazole. An aliquot (15 μl) of the eluate was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 15% acrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. We isolated 24 plasmids that conferred cyclic AMP-independent growth at 34 °C when introduced into strain TC41F2-1; this phenotype is presumed to reflect the expression of Gsα-independent adenylyl cyclase activity. The mutagenized regions of these plasmids were sequenced, and their mutations are listed in Table I. Cp4465, which encodes ACII I259V/Y402C, was used to generate the two plasmids ACII I259V and ACII Y402C; similarly, Cp4522 was used to generate two plasmids encoding ACII M253V and ACII C305R. In this way it was found that ACII C305R and ACII Y402C are constitutively active mutants. In several cases mutations that were observed in genetically selected plasmids were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis into wild type ACII to test their effects independently of coincident mutations. TableII lists the mutations and the growth characteristics of all constitutively active ACII single mutants.Table IGrowth of yeast harboring plasmids encoding mutant adenylyl cyclases that confer independence of Gsα and cAMPPlasmidAmino acid substitutionsGrowth at 34 °C 1-aGrowth was determined by visual inspection of streaked colonies.

Open table in a new tab It is possible that plasmid-dependent variations in copy number could account for the phenotypes conferred by the ACII mutants. We addressed that possibility by subcloning six of the genetically selected missense mutants into centromeric vectors whose copy number is stably maintained at 1–3 per cell (17Clarke L. Carbon J. Nature. 1980; 287: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In each case the phenotype conferred by the centromeric plasmid was the same as that imparted by its high copy equivalent (data not shown). We thus suggest that all 14 mutants listed in Table II have elevated specific activities. The mutations identified in the yeast screen were generated in the soluble mammalian adenylyl cyclase system to facilitate biochemical characterization. The mutations were made in the C1a domain of canine type V adenylyl cyclase at the residues that correspond to those mutated in the C1a domain of rat type II adenylyl cyclase. The mutations F298Y, C305R, N315S, K334R, and V377I from rat ACIIC1a were made to the following residues in canine ACVC1a: F400Y, C407R, N417S, K436R, and V479I. A similar screen in yeast using rat type IV adenylyl cyclase 2S. Haney, J. Xu, S.-Y. Lee, C.-L. Ma, E. Duzic, J. Broach, and J. Manfredi, manuscript in preparation. generated mutations Y265H, V388I, G968S, and K998N; these mutations were made in VC1 and IIC2, respectively, as Y383H, V506I, G970S, and K1014N. No conversion was necessary for the remainder of the mutations since they were already in rat ACIIC2. All mutant proteins, with the exception of C407R, K436R, and V506I, were expressed and purified to degrees comparable to levels described previously for the wild type proteins. The mutants were assayed for activity at limiting concentrations of the VC1 domain and increasing concentrations of the IIC2 domain in the absence of activators or in the presence of forskolin. The apparent affinity between the two soluble domains of adenylyl cyclase was expressed as the EC50, and the apparent Vmax was extrapolated from the asymptote of the curve. The apparent EC50 and Vmax values for the mutant proteins are summarized in Table III.Table IIIAffinity and activity of purified adenylyl cyclase mutantsMutantBasal EC50BasalVmaxForskolin EC50Forskolin VmaxμmRatio WT/mutantnmol/min/mg% WTμmRatio WT/mutantnmol/min/mg% WTY383H 3-aProtein purified by metal affinity column followed by anion exchange chromatography.5 (4.8)0.96460 (550)841.7 (1.3)0.7685 (130)65F400Y 3-aProtein purified by metal affinity column followed by anion exchange chromatography.18 (8)0.44380 (840)453 (1.4)0.4789 (130)68C407R 3-aProtein purified by metal affinity column followed by anion exchange chromatography.N417S 3-aProtein purified by metal affinity column followed by anion exchange chromatography.7 (8)1.10260 (410)631.5 (1.4)0.9356 (100)56K436R 3-aProtein purified by metal affinity column followed by anion exchange chromatography.V479I12 (5.7)0.48310 (570)541.9 (1.4)0.7437 (88)42V506I 3-aProtein purified by metal affinity column followed by anion exchange chromatography.8 (7)0.88980 (660)1500.55 (1.7)3.181 (130)62L877P 3-bProtein purified by metal affinity column.3 (2)0.67250 (170)1501.1 (1.5)1.448 (44)110K896E 3-bProtein purified by metal affinity column.3 (2.4)0.80150 (150)1001.3 (1.2)0.9234 (55)62G970S 3-aProtein purified by metal affinity column followed by anion exchange chromatography.3 (4)1.30680 (650)1050.89 (0.83)0.93120 (93)130I1010M 3-bProtein purified by metal affinity column.4.5 (2.7)0.60410 (190)2202.2 (1.3)0.59110 (65)170K1014N 3-bProtein purified by metal affinity column.1.6 (2.4)1.501200 (170)7000.33 (1.4)4.2078 (60)130P1015Q 3-bProtein purified by metal affinity column.4.2 (2.2)0.52510 (160)3201.4 (1.2)0.86100 (56)180The apparent affinities and maximal activities were determined for each mutant protein by assaying a limiting concentration of VC1 (30 nm for basal; 2 nm with forskolin) with increasing concentrations of IIC2 in the absence and presence of 100 μm forskolin.

Open table in a new tab The apparent affinities and maximal activities were determined for each mutant protein by assaying a limiting concentration of VC1 (30 nm for basal; 2 nm with forskolin) with increasing concentrations of IIC2 in the absence and presence of 100 μm forskolin. The values in parentheses are the values for the wild type protein in each assay. Surprisingly, most mutant proteins displayed only modest differences in the apparent affinity or Vmax when compared with the corresponding wild type domain. Mutants C407R and K436R yielded very little protein with no measurable adenylyl cyclase activity. The V506I mutation in VC1 caused an increase in basal enzymatic activity and a 3-fold decrease in EC50 in the presence of forskolin. However, the low level of expression of this protein precluded detailed characterization. The mutations I1010M, K1014N, and P1015Q, all located in the β4-β5 loop of IIC2, caused an increase in Vmax in both the basal and the forskolin-stimulated conditions. The K1014N mutation appeared to cause the largest degree of constitutive activation; IIC2-K1014N was thus purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and characterized biochemically. The apparent affinity of IIC2-K1014N for wild type VC1 was determined in various activation states. The activities shown in Fig. 1 were determined with a limiting concentration of VC1 and either variable concentrations (Fig. 1, A–C) or a saturating concentration (Fig. 1 D) of IIC2. The apparent affinity for VC1 and the maximal catalytic activity were both 3-fold greater for the K1014N mutant compared with wild type IIC2 in the absence of activators (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, the apparent affinity of IIC2-K1014N for VC1 was 3-fold higher in the presence of forskolin (Fig. 1 B) and 10-fold higher in the presence of Gsα-GTPγS (Fig. 1 C) compared with its wild type counterpart. No significant changes were observed inVmax under these conditions. There was no difference in either the EC50 or theVmax in the presence of both forskolin and Gsα-GTPγS, demonstrating that the mutation does not create a hyperactive enzyme. Similar results were observed using limiting concentrations of IIC2 and varying concentrations of VC1 (data not shown). The apparent affinity of Gsα-GTPγS for adenylyl cyclase is shown in Fig. 1 D. The EC50 for Gsα-GTPγS was 0.05 μm for K1014N compared with 0.4 μm for the wild type IIC2. These values were 6 and 25 nm, respectively, in the presence of forskolin. The kinetic constants for substrate were also determined under various conditions (Fig. 2 and TableIV). Reconstituted adenylyl cyclase containing IIC2-K1014N exhibited a Km value for ATP that was 6-fold less than that observed with the wild type protein under basal conditions. As noted above, Vmax is increased under this condition. Assays performed with activated Gsα revealed a 6-fold decrease in the Km value for ATP when the mutation was present. No changes were obvious in the presence of forskolin, with or without Gsα-GTPγS.Table IVSubstrate kinetics with IIC2 or IIC2-K1014NConditionProteinKm(ATP)Vmaxμmμmol/min/mgBasalK1014N210 ± 280.78 ± 0.23IIC21300 ± 3100.20 ± 0.07ForskolinK1014N380 ± 4083 ± 8IIC2840 ± 8566 ± 2GsαK1014N35 ± 526 ± 1IIC2220 ± 4528 ± 4Gsα + ForskolinK1014N160 ± 2792 ± 18IIC2210 ± 26106 ± 24Experimental values are reported as the mean and S.E. for two or three experiments.

Purified H6-VC1 and wild type or IIC2-K1014N were combined with Gsα-GTPγS and gel-filtered using tandem Superdex 75 and 200 columns. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). In the absence of forskolin, there is no evidence for formation of a complex between VC1, wild type IIC2, and Gsα (Fig. 3 B). The largest apparent species (78 kDa) is likely a heterodimer consisting of IIC2 and Gsα; similar results have been reported previously (10Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, protein in the mixture of VC1, IIC2-K1014N, and Gsα eluted as two major peaks with the largest species representing a 100-kDa complex. Analysis by SDS-PAGE indicates a complex of VC1, IIC2-K1014N, and Gsα with an apparent stoichiometry of 1:1:1 (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were observed with wild type IIC2 only when forskolin was present (10Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Purified H6-VC1 and non-tagged wild type or IIC2-K1014N were combined and applied to a metal chelate chromatographic column (TalonTM,CLONTECH). Samples were eluted with imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). No complex was detected by SDS-PAGE when H6-VC1 and IIC2or IIC2-K1014N were incubated with forskolin. Some IIC2-K1014N was retained on the column in the presence of the P-site inhibitor 2′d,3′-AMP·PPi; wild type IIC2 was not. When both forskolin and 2′d,3′-AMP·PPi were present, a complex of H6-VC1 and either IIC2 or K1014N was isolated. These complexes had apparent stoichiometries of 1:1 (determined by scanning densitometry). Similar results were obtained when Mn2+ replaced Mg2+ (data not shown). The crystal structure of the cytosolic portions of adenylyl cyclase demonstrates that the C1 and C2 domains are arranged as a pseudo-2-fold symmetrical dimer (see insetin Fig. 5) (11Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The contributions of several residues within each domain to substrate and Mg2+binding, as well as catalysis, have been investigated in previous studies. Adenylyl cyclases, and presumably guanylyl cyclases, contain palm domains. These domains were defined previously in DNA polymerases, enzymes that catalyze very similar reactions (18Artymiuk P.J. Poirrette A.R. Rice D.W. Willett P. Nature. 1997; 388: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase have revealed significant conformational changes upon substrate binding (11Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The α1 and α2 helices and the α3 and β4 helix/strand of C1 and the β7-β8 loop of C2 collapse around the nucleotide and align the nucleotide and two metal ions for catalysis. Located within the active site is the β2-β3 loop of C1, containing aspartate residues 396 and 440 that coordinate two Mg2+ions. These divalent cations participate in deprotonation of the 3′ hydroxyl of the ribose moiety (a critical step in the synthesis of cyclic AMP) and stabilize the pentavalent transition state. The conserved aspartate residues are also found among DNA polymerases and guanylyl cyclases (11Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 12Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

The β4-β5 loop of C2 supports the β2-β3 loop of C1 (Fig. 5). Perturbations in either the contact regions or the loop-fold could have dramatic effects on C1:C2 structure and hence activity. Several residues in both the β2-β3 loop and the α2 helix of C1 and the β4-β5 loop of C2 have been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and have various effects on adenylyl cyclase activity. Structural evidence strongly suggests that Asp-424 in the α2 helix and Arg-434 in the β2 sheet of C1 engage in extensive hydrogen bonding with the β4-β5 loop of C2 (Fig. 5). Asp-424 forms a salt bridge with Arg-434 and a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogens of Ala-1012 and Gln-1013. The side chain of Arg-434 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln-1016; the backbone carbonyl of Arg-434 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln-1013. Mutations of either Asp-424 or Arg-434 have previously been shown to have detrimental effects on adenylyl cyclase activity. Mutations of these residues have broad effects on cyclase activity without affecting the affinity of the enzyme for Gsα, as follows: R434A increases the IC50 value for P-site inhibitors (23Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); R434S increases theKm value for MgATP, the Ki value for ATPαS, and the EC50 value for Mg2+(24Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); D424A and D424N decrease forskolin- and Gsα-stimulated enzymatic activity (23Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Zimmerman G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6968-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutations of residues in the β4-β5 loop of C2have also been shown to affect adenylyl cyclase activity. The mutations Y1017A and D1018A (Y999A and D1000A in type I adenylyl cyclase) obliterate activity without eliminating Gsα binding (23Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Asp-1018 coordinates substrate binding through the purine ring and is responsible for dictating nucleotide specificity (11Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 26Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16332-16338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Alteration in neighboring side chains that perturb the conformation of the amino acid chain backbone would likely perturb activity. Residues Ile-1010, Lys-1014, and Pro-1015, investigated in this study, are all located in the β4-β5 loop of C2 and therefore are intimately involved in the arrangement of the β2-β3 loop of C1. The mutations I1010M, K1014N, and P1015Q are all within bonding distance of the β2-β3 loop of C1. The P1015Q mutation, which displays slightly elevated affinity between C1 and C2, was previously identified as a second site suppresser of a catalytically inactive mutant (N1025S) but unfortunately was not characterized alone (27Yan S.Z. Huang Z.H. Shaw R.S. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12342-12349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Prediction of the positions of the side chains of the β4-β5 loop of C2 is difficult because of its flexibility; however, some explanations of the activating mutations can be extracted from the crystal structure. We expect K1014 upon mutation to asparagine to pack between adjacent glutamines in the β4-β5 loop of C2 and form a stabilizing hydrogen bond with Arg-434 in the β2-β3 loop of C1. P1015Q could rearrange the β4-β5 loop, causing a more active conformation. I1010M fills space in the hydrophobic pocket with a larger hydrophobic residue. The introduction of new side chain interactions contributed by mutations I1010M or K1014N or the removal of main chain constraints with mutation P1015Q may alter the C1 β2-β3 loop and enhance activity. Taken together, these mutations suggest that proper formation of a competent active site is inhibited by decreased and promoted by increased interactions between the β4-β5 loop of C2 and the β2-β3 loop of C1. The β4-β5 loop of the C1 domain has a congruous interaction with the β2-β3 loop of C2 because of the pseudosymmetrical structure of adenylyl cyclase. Of the clones obtained from the genetic screen, only V506I displayed significant enhancement of activity when tested in the soluble adenylyl cyclase system. V506I adds a methyl group that may form a primary contact with forskolin and increase the hydrophobicity of the forskolin-binding pocket. Another possible explanation is that substitution of the isoleucine may enhance C1-C2 interactions by altering van der Waals contacts with neighboring residues in the β4-β5 loop of C1. The structural effect of this minor change at the base of the loop may be amplified along the length of the loop and thus alter interactions with the β2-β3 loop of C2. It is difficult to determine why other mutations displayed strong phenotypes in yeast but failed to produce substantial changes in the soluble adenylyl cyclase assays. As demonstrated in this study, mutations that increase favorable interactions between the β2-β3 loop of C1 and the β4-β5 loop of C2 likely account for the increased activity that was observed. Alternatively, increased activity may be related to the method of protein expression, since the soluble C1 and C2 domains remain as homodimers when expressed and purified individually. Mutations in the interface region may alter homodimerization. Mutations that impair homodimerization may favor heterodimerization and hence increase adenylyl cyclase activity. More likely, the lack of increased basal activity in the in vitro assays of many of the mutants could be explained by the inherent sensitivity to small changes in cyclic AMP concentrations of the yeast screen. The lack of change in activity in vitro could also be explained by the ablation of the membrane domains and the putative regulatory C1b domain in the soluble constructs. For example, the F400Y mutation has been shown to increase both basal activity and sensitivity to the activators Gsα and forskolin and to abrogate inhibition by Giα (28Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, when assayed in the soluble system, this mutation caused no increase in basal activity or sensitivity to forskolin compared with the wild type enzyme. The contribution of the C1b domain to activity are not known, nor is there any structural information on this domain. As mentioned previously, all complexes of adenylyl cyclase whose structures have been determined to date contain both Gsα and forskolin. Endogenous forskolin-like substances have yet to be discovered, begging the questions of the physiological significance of the C1·C2·forskolin·Gsα-GTPγS structure and the degree to which it resembles the structure of C1:C2:Gsα-GTPγS. Or rather, what is the mechanism of activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin? This is a particularly interesting question, since some forms of adenylyl cyclase (types II, IV, and V–VII) are activated synergistically by forskolin and Gsα-GTPγS, whereas others (2Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) are activated only additively (types I, III, and VIII). The K1014N mutation facilitated the isolation of a C1·C2·Gsα-GTPγS complex in the absence of forskolin. Determination of the structure of this complex would further our understanding of activation of adenylyl cyclase by the diterpene. The crystal structure of a homodimer of the C2 domain bound with two molecules of forskolin has also been determined (29Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The structure also contains a 2-fold symmetrical arrangement of the domains and has been used as a model for the basal, nonactivated form of adenylyl cyclase. However, the presence of two forskolin molecules in a complex without an active site inherently precludes this structure as a precise model of nonactivated adenylyl cyclase. It is our hope that the structure of the constitutively active mutants described herein, particularly that of VC1 associated with IIC2-K1014N, may represent a closer approximation of the low activity basal state. We thank Julie Collins for technical assistance. We also thank J. J. G. Tesmer for critically reading the manuscript, helpful discussions of the adenylyl cyclase structure, and constructing Fig. 5."
