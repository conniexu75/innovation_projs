However, the 3D organization of chromosomes during human brain development and its role in regulating gene networks dysregulated in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or schizophrenia4,5,6, are unknown. Here we generate high-resolution 3D maps of chromatin contacts during human corticogenesis, permitting large-scale annotation of previously uncharacterized regulatory relationships relevant to the evolution of human cognition and disease. Our analyses identify hundreds of genes that physically interact with enhancers gained on the human lineage, many of which are under purifying selection and associated with human cognitive function. We integrate chromatin contacts with non-coding variants identified in schizophrenia genome-wide association studies (GWAS), highlighting multiple candidate schizophrenia risk genes and pathways, including transcription factors involved in neurogenesis, and cholinergic signalling molecules, several of which are supported by independent expression quantitative trait loci and gene expression analyses. Genome editing in human neural progenitors suggests that one of these distal schizophrenia GWAS loci regulates FOXG1 expression, supporting its potential role as a schizophrenia risk gene. This work provides a framework for understanding the effect of non-coding regulatory elements on human brain development and the evolution of cognition, and highlights novel mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders. High-resolution three-dimensional maps of chromatin contacts in the developing human brain help to identify enhancer–promoter contacts, many of which are associated with human cognitive function and disease. Chromatin is organized into hierarchical three-dimensional structures that are thought to have a role in gene regulation by defining the functional units within which cis-regulatory elements interact with their target genes. Here, Daniel Geschwind and colleagues use the Hi-C technique to generate high-resolution three-dimensional maps of chromatin contacts in human developing brain. By integrating the Hi-C maps with other datasets they identify novel enhancer–promoter contacts, many of which are associated with human cognitive function. They also integrate these chromatin contact maps with non-coding variants identified in schizophrenia genome-wide association studies to propose novel candidate risk genes and pathways for schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2532734448,"Homology-directed DNA repair is essential for genome maintenance through templated DNA synthesis. Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) necessitates homology-directed DNA repair to maintain telomeres in about 10-15% of human cancers. How DNA damage induces assembly and execution of a DNA replication complex (break-induced replisome) at telomeres or elsewhere in the mammalian genome is poorly understood. Here we define break-induced telomere synthesis and demonstrate that it utilizes a specialized replisome, which underlies ALT telomere maintenance. DNA double-strand breaks enact nascent telomere synthesis by long-tract unidirectional replication. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) loading by replication factor C (RFC) acts as the initial sensor of telomere damage to establish predominance of DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) through its POLD3 subunit. Break-induced telomere synthesis requires the RFC-PCNA-Pol δ axis, but is independent of other canonical replisome components, ATM and ATR, or the homologous recombination protein Rad51. Thus, the inception of telomere damage recognition by the break-induced replisome orchestrates homology-directed telomere maintenance."

In Brazil there are archaeological sites with abundant accumulations of chipped stones. The accumulation and the stones, if discovered in a three-million-year-old context in Africa, might be taken as evidence of an early stone tool culture. But in this instance the perpetrators have been caught in the act. This study reports observations of wild bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) deliberately breaking stones in Brazil's Serra da Capivara National Park. Why they do this is not clear, though they sometimes lick or sniff the crushed stone, prompting speculation that that they may be ingesting powdered quartz or lichens. However, the monkeys do not appear to use the sharp edges to cut or scrape other objects. These monkeys are the only non-hominin primates to interact with stone so frequently, and the fact that they produce accumulations of worked stone similar to those presumed elsewhere to represent the work of early hominins could help to inform interpretation of the human Palaeolithic record. Our understanding of the emergence of technology shapes how we view the origins of humanity1,2. Sharp-edged stone flakes, struck from larger cores, are the primary evidence for the earliest stone technology3. Here we show that wild bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) in Brazil deliberately break stones, unintentionally producing recurrent, conchoidally fractured, sharp-edged flakes and cores that have the characteristics and morphology of intentionally produced hominin tools. The production of archaeologically visible cores and flakes is therefore no longer unique to the human lineage, providing a comparative perspective on the emergence of lithic technology. This discovery adds an additional dimension to interpretations of the human Palaeolithic record, the possible function of early stone tools, and the cognitive requirements for the emergence of stone flaking."

https://openalex.org/W2534442133,"In the practical farming of Litopenaeus vannamei, the intensive culture system and environmental pollution usually results in a high concentration of ammonia, which usually brings large detrimental effects to shrimp, such as increasing the susceptibility to pathogens, reducing growth, decreasing osmoregulatory capacity, increasing the molting frequency, and even causing high mortality. However, little information is available on the molecular mechanisms of the detrimental effects of ammonia stress in shrimp. In this study, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis between ammonia-challenged and control groups from the same family of L. vannamei to identify the key genes and pathways response to ammonia stress. The comparative transcriptome analysis identified 136 significantly differentially expressed genes that have high homologies with the known proteins in aquatic species, among which 94 genes are reported potentially related to immune function, and the rest of the genes are involved in apoptosis, growth, molting, and osmoregulation. Fourteen GO terms and 6 KEGG pathways were identified to be significantly changed by ammonia stress. In these GO terms, 13 genes have been studied in aquatic species, and 11 of them were reported potentially involved in immune defense and two genes were related to molting. In the significantly changed KEGG pathways, all the 7 significantly changed genes have been reported in shrimp, and four of them were potentially involved in immune defense and the other three were related to molting, defending toxicity, and osmoregulation, respectively. In addition, majority of the significantly changed genes involved in nitrogen metabolisms that play an important role in reducing ammonia toxicity failed to perform the protection function. The present results have supplied molecular level support for the previous founding of the detrimental effects of ammonia stress in shrimp, which is a prerequisite for better understanding the molecular mechanism of the immunosuppression from ammonia stress."
https://openalex.org/W2533611849,"As the volume of publications rapidly increases, searching for relevant information from the literature becomes more challenging. To complement standard search engines such as PubMed, it is desirable to have an advanced search tool that directly returns relevant biomedical entities such as targets, drugs, and mutations rather than a long list of articles. Some existing tools submit a query to PubMed and process retrieved abstracts to extract information at query time, resulting in a slow response time and limited coverage of only a fraction of the PubMed corpus. Other tools preprocess the PubMed corpus to speed up the response time; however, they are not constantly updated, and thus produce outdated results. Further, most existing tools cannot process sophisticated queries such as searches for mutations that co-occur with query terms in the literature. To address these problems, we introduce BEST, a biomedical entity search tool. BEST returns, as a result, a list of 10 different types of biomedical entities including genes, diseases, drugs, targets, transcription factors, miRNAs, and mutations that are relevant to a user's query. To the best of our knowledge, BEST is the only system that processes free text queries and returns up-to-date results in real time including mutation information in the results. BEST is freely accessible at http://best.korea.ac.kr."

https://openalex.org/W2533755944,"The discovery of introns four decades ago was one of the most unexpected findings in molecular biology. Introns are sequences interrupting genes that must be removed as part of messenger RNA production. Genome sequencing projects have shown that most eukaryotic genes contain at least one intron, and frequently many. Comparison of these genomes reveals a history of long evolutionary periods during which few introns were gained, punctuated by episodes of rapid, extensive gain. However, although several detailed mechanisms for such episodic intron generation have been proposed, none has been empirically supported on a genomic scale. Here we show how short, non-autonomous DNA transposons independently generated hundreds to thousands of introns in the prasinophyte Micromonas pusilla and the pelagophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens. Each transposon carries one splice site. The other splice site is co-opted from the gene sequence that is duplicated upon transposon insertion, allowing perfect splicing out of the RNA. The distributions of sequences that can be co-opted are biased with respect to codons, and phasing of transposon-generated introns is similarly biased. These transposons insert between pre-existing nucleosomes, so that multiple nearby insertions generate nucleosome-sized intervening segments. Thus, transposon insertion and sequence co-option may explain the intron phase biases and prevalence of nucleosome-sized exons observed in eukaryotes. Overall, the two independent examples of proliferating elements illustrate a general DNA transposon mechanism that can plausibly account for episodes of rapid, extensive intron gain during eukaryotic evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2529802733,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a small subpopulation of self-renewing oncogenic cells. As in many other stem cells, metabolic reprogramming has been implicated to be a key characteristic of CSCs. However, little is known about how the metabolic features of cancer cells are controlled to orchestrate their CSC-like properties. We recently demonstrated that hyaluronan (HA) overproduction allowed plastic cancer cells to revert to stem cell states. Here, we adopted stable isotope-assisted tracing and mass spectrometry profiling to elucidate the metabolic features of HA-overproducing breast cancer cells. These integrated approaches disclosed an acceleration of metabolic flux in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). A metabolic shift toward glycolysis was also evident by quantitative targeted metabolomics, which was validated by the expression profiles of key glycolytic enzymes. Forced expression of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase 1 (GFAT1), an HBP rate-limiting enzyme, resembled the results of HA overproduction with regard to HIF-1α accumulation and glycolytic program, whereas GFAT1 inhibition significantly decreased HIF-1α protein level in HA-overproducing cancer cells. Moreover, inhibition of the HBP-HIF-1 axis abrogated HA-driven glycolytic enhancement and reduced the CSC-like subpopulation. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that HA production regulates the metabolic and CSC-like properties of breast cancer cells via HBP-coupled HIF-1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2528064348,"Mammalian cytochrome c (Cytc) plays a key role in cellular life and death decisions, functioning as an electron carrier in the electron transport chain and as a trigger of apoptosis when released from the mitochondria. However, its regulation is not well understood. We show that the major fraction of Cytc isolated from kidneys is phosphorylated on Thr28, leading to a partial inhibition of respiration in the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase. To further study the effect of Cytc phosphorylation in vitro, we generated T28E phosphomimetic Cytc, revealing superior behavior regarding protein stability and its ability to degrade reactive oxygen species compared with wild-type unphosphorylated Cytc. Introduction of T28E phosphomimetic Cytc into Cytc knock-out cells shows that intact cell mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and ROS levels are reduced compared with wild type. As we show by high resolution crystallography of wild-type and T28E Cytc in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, Thr28 is located at a central position near the heme crevice, the most flexible epitope of the protein apart from the N and C termini. Finally, in silico prediction and our experimental data suggest that AMP kinase, which phosphorylates Cytc on Thr28 in vitro and colocalizes with Cytc to the mitochondrial intermembrane space in the kidney, is the most likely candidate to phosphorylate Thr28 in vivo. We conclude that Cytc phosphorylation is mediated in a tissue-specific manner and leads to regulation of electron transport chain flux via controlled respiration, preventing ΔΨm hyperpolarization, a known cause of ROS and trigger of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2527752834,"Protein phosphatases play vital roles in phosphorylation-mediated cellular signaling. Although there are 11 serine/threonine protein kinases in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, only one serine/threonine phosphatase, PstP, has been identified. Although PstP has been biochemically characterized and multiple in vitro substrates have been identified, its physiological role has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we have investigated the impact of PstP on cell growth and survival of the pathogen in the host. Overexpression of PstP led to elongated cells and partially compromised survival. We find that depletion of PstP is detrimental to cell survival, eventually leading to cell death. PstP depletion results in elongated multiseptate cells, suggesting a role for PstP in regulating cell division events. Complementation experiments performed with PstP deletion mutants revealed marginally compromised survival, suggesting that all of the domains, including the extracellular domain, are necessary for complete rescue. On the other hand, the catalytic activity of PstP is absolutely essential for the in vitro growth. Mice infection experiments establish a definitive role for PstP in pathogen survival within the host. Depletion of PstP from established infections causes pathogen clearance, indicating that the continued presence of PstP is necessary for pathogen survival. Taken together, our data suggest an important role for PstP in establishing and maintaining infection, possibly via the modulation of cell division events."
https://openalex.org/W2534321719,"In Mediterranean subtidal rocky reefs, Cystoseira spp. (Phaeophyceae) form dense canopies up to 1 m high. Such habitats, called 'Cystoseira forests', are regressing across the entire Mediterranean Sea due to multiple anthropogenic stressors, as are other large brown algae forests worldwide. Cystoseira forests are being replaced by structurally less complex habitats, but little information is available regarding the potential difference in the structure and composition of fish assemblages between these habitats. To fill this void, we compared necto-benthic (NB) and crypto-benthic (CB) fish assemblage structures between Cystoseira forests and two habitats usually replacing the forests (turf and barren), in two sampling regions (Corsica and Menorca). We sampled NB fish using Underwater Visual Census (UVC) and CB fish using Enclosed Anaesthetic Station Vacuuming (EASV), since UVC is known to underestimate the diversity and density of the 'hard to spot' CB fish. We found that both taxonomic diversity and total density of NB and CB fish were highest in Cystoseira forests and lowest in barrens, while turfs, that could be sampled only at Menorca, showed intermediate values. Conversely, total biomass of NB and CB fish did not differ between habitats because the larger average size of fish in barrens (and turfs) compensated for their lower densities. The NB families Labridae and Serranidae, and the CB families Blenniidae, Cliniidae, Gobiidae, Trypterigiidae and Scorpaenidae, were more abundant in forests. The NB taxa Diplodus spp. and Thalassoma pavo were more abundant in barrens. Our study highlights the importance of using EASV for sampling CB fish, and shows that Cystoseira forests support rich and diversified fish assemblages. This evidence suggests that the ongoing loss of Cystoseira forests may impair coastal fish assemblages and related goods and services to humans, and stresses the need to implement strategies for the successful conservation and/or recovery of marine forests."
https://openalex.org/W2535384070,"Background Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs) are developed to promote healthier eating patterns, but increasing food prices may make healthy eating less affordable. The aim of this study was to design a range of cost-minimized nutritionally adequate health-promoting food baskets (FBs) that help prevent both micronutrient inadequacy and diet-related non-communicable diseases at lowest cost. Methods Average prices for 312 foods were collected within the Greater Copenhagen area. The cost and nutrient content of five different cost-minimized FBs for a family of four were calculated per day using linear programming. The FBs were defined using five different constraints: cultural acceptability (CA), or dietary guidelines (DG), or nutrient recommendations (N), or cultural acceptability and nutrient recommendations (CAN), or dietary guidelines and nutrient recommendations (DGN). The variety and number of foods in each of the resulting five baskets was increased through limiting the relative share of individual foods. Results The one-day version of N contained only 12 foods at the minimum cost of DKK 27 (€ 3.6). The CA, DG, and DGN were about twice of this and the CAN cost ~DKK 81 (€ 10.8). The baskets with the greater variety of foods contained from 70 (CAN) to 134 (DGN) foods and cost between DKK 60 (€ 8.1, N) and DKK 125 (€ 16.8, DGN). Ensuring that the food baskets cover both dietary guidelines and nutrient recommendations doubled the cost while cultural acceptability (CAN) tripled it. Conclusion Use of linear programming facilitates the generation of low-cost food baskets that are nutritionally adequate, health promoting, and culturally acceptable."
https://openalex.org/W2538629671,"Paratuberculosis in cattle is a chronic granulomatous gastroenteritis caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratubercolosis (MAP) which is endemic worldwide. In dairy herds, it is responsible for huge economic losses. However, current diagnostic methods do not detect subclinical infection making control of the disease difficult. The identification of MAP infected animals during the sub-clinical phase of infection would play a key role in preventing the dissemination of the pathogen and in reducing transmission. Gene expression and circulating microRNA (miRNA) signatures have been proposed as biomarkers of disease both in the human and veterinary medicine. In this paper, gene expression and related miRNA levels were investigated in cows positive for MAP, by ELISA and culture, in order to identify potential biomarkers to improve diagnosis of MAP infection. Three groups, each of 5 animals, were used to compare the results of gene expression from positive, exposed and negative cows. Overall 258 differentially expressed genes were identified between unexposed, exposed, but ELISA negative and positive groups which were involved in biological functions related to inflammatory response, lipid metabolism and small molecule biochemistry. Differentially expressed miRNA was also found among the three groups: 7 miRNAs were at a lower level and 2 at a higher level in positive animals vs unexposed animals, while 5 and 3 miRNAs were respectively reduced and increased in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs 6 have been previously described as immune-response related and two were novel miRNAs. Analysis of the miRNA levels showed correlation with expression of their target genes, known to be involved in the immune process. This study suggests that miRNA expression is affected by MAP infection and play a key role in tuning the host response to infection. The miRNA and gene expression profiles may be biomarkers of infection and potential diagnostic of MAP infection earlier than the current ELISA based diagnostic tests."
https://openalex.org/W2527973576,"The synthetic antimicrobial peptide SET-M33 has strong activity against bacterial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. It is currently in preclinical development as a new drug to treat lung infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Here we report its strong anti-inflammatory activity in terms of reduced expression of a number of cytokines, enzymes, and signal transduction factors involved in inflammation triggered by LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Sixteen cytokines and other major agents involved in inflammation were analyzed in macrophages and bronchial cells after stimulation with LPS and incubation with SET-M33. The bronchial cells were obtained from a cystic fibrosis patient. A number of these proteins showed up to 100% reduction in expression as measured by RT-PCR, Western blotting, or Luminex technology. LPS neutralization was also demonstrated in vivo by challenging bronchoalveolar lavage of SET-M33-treated mice with LPS, which led to a sharp reduction in TNF-α with respect to non-SET-M33-treated animals. We also describe a strong activity of SET-M33 in stimulating cell migration of keratinocytes in wound healing experiments in vitro, demonstrating a powerful immunomodulatory action generally characteristic of molecules taking part in innate immunity."

For the first time, the present study analysed dietary effects on the protein inventory of the microbiome in crop and ceca of broilers. We performed quantitative label-free metaproteomics by using 1-D-gel electrophoresis coupled with LC-MS/MS to identify the structural and functional changes triggered by diets supplied with varying amount of mineral phosphorous (P) and microbial phytase (MP). Phylogenetic assessment based on label-free quantification (LFQ) values of the proteins identified Lactobacillaceae as the major family in the crop section regardless of the diet, whereas proteins belonging to the family Veillonellaceae increased with the P supplementation. Within the ceca section, proteins of Bacteroidaceae were more abundant in the P-supplied diets, whereas proteins of Eubacteriaceae decreased with the P-addition. Proteins of the Ruminococcaceae increased with the amount of MP while proteins of Lactobacillaceae were more abundant in the MP-lacking diets. Classification of the identified proteins indicated a thriving microbial community in the case of P and MP supplementation, and stressed microbial community when no P and MP were supplied. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003805."
https://openalex.org/W2532697785,"East African elephants have been hunted for their ivory for millennia but the nineteenth century witnessed strongly escalating demand from Europe and North America. It has been suggested that one consequence was that by the 1880s elephant herds along the coast had become scarce, and to meet demand, trade caravans trekked farther into interior regions of East Africa, extending the extraction frontier. The steady decimation of elephant populations coupled with the extension of trade networks have also been claimed to have triggered significant ecological and socio-economic changes that left lasting legacies across the region. To explore the feasibility of using an isotopic approach to uncover a ‘moving frontier’ of elephant extraction, we constructed a baseline isotope data set (δ13C, δ15N, δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr) for historic East African elephants known to have come from three distinct regions (coastal, Rift Valley, and inland Lakes). Using the isotope results with other climate data and geographical mapping tools, it was possible to characterise elephants from different habitats across the region. This baseline data set was then used to provenance elephant ivory of unknown geographical provenance that was exported from East Africa during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to determine its likely origin. This produced a better understanding of historic elephant geography in the region, and the data have the potential to be used to provenance older archaeological ivories, and to inform contemporary elephant conservation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2529349307,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are activated by environmental particulate materials. We hypothesized that polymorphic variants of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) would be uniquely responsive to insoluble coal fly ash compared with the prototypical soluble agonist capsaicin. Furthermore, these changes would manifest as differences in lung cell responses to these agonists and perhaps correlate with changes in asthma symptom control. The TRPV1-I315M and -T469I variants were more responsive to capsaicin and coal fly ash. The I585V variant was less responsive to coal fly ash particles due to reduced translation of protein and an apparent role for Ile-585 in activation by particles. In HEK-293 cells, I585V had an inhibitory effect on wild-type TRPV1 expression, activation, and internalization/agonist-induced desensitization. In normal human bronchial epithelial cells, IL-8 secretion in response to coal fly ash treatment was reduced for cells heterozygous for TRPV1-I585V. Finally, both the I315M and I585V variants were associated with worse asthma symptom control with the effects of I315M manifesting in mild asthma and those of the I585V variant manifesting in severe, steroid-insensitive individuals. This effect may be due in part to increased transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA1) expression by lung epithelial cells expressing the TRPV1-I585V variant. These findings suggest that specific molecular interactions control TRPV1 activation by particles, differential activation, and desensitization of TRPV1 by particles and/or other agonists, and cellular changes in the expression of TRPA1 as a result of I585V expression could contribute to variations in asthma symptom control.

The hypothesis of this study was that natural coding variants of TRPV1 would be uniquely responsive to traditional soluble (capsaicin) and atypical insoluble particle (CFA) agonists, which would manifest as differences in typical cellular responses to these agonists and perhaps an effect on asthma severity and symptom control among a cohort of asthmatic children in Utah. The hypothesis is based on results showing that some individuals with asthma, mainly cough variant asthma, exhibit greater sensitivity in capsaicin cough challenge tests (32.Dicpinigaitis P.V.

Further understanding of the effects of TRPV1 genotype on asthma could aid clinicians in understanding why certain individuals are more sensitive to various stimuli and potentially direct them toward more appropriate treatments. In this study, we utilized a combination of in vitro tests of TRPV1 expression and function using both capsaicin and CFA as agonists to further explain unique mechanisms of TRPV1 activation by PM. We then assessed TRPV1-mediated desensitization, chemokine production, and TRP gene expression in primary human bronchial epithelial cells expressing either wild type or the TRPV1-I585V variant. Finally, we correlated genetic and clinical data from a cohort of children with asthma from Salt Lake City, UT (43.Smit L.A. Kogevinas M. Antó J.M. Bouzigon E. González J.R. Le Moual N. Kromhout H. Carsin A.E. Pin I. Jarvis D. Vermeulen R. Janson C. Heinrich J. Gut I. Lathrop M. et al.Transient receptor potential genes, smoking, occupational exposures and cough in adults.Respir. Res. 2012; 13: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to assess whether TRPV1 variants with altered activity affected asthma. Activation of TRPV1 and six non-synonymous SNP variants by capsaicin and CFA particles was compared in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells using changes in intracellular calcium content as a measure of TRPV1 activity (Fig. 1). The SNP variants I315M, T469I, and I585V exhibited ∼32, 47, and 14% greater activity than wild-type TRPV1 using capsaicin as an agonist. The I315M and T469I variants were also ∼54 and 33% more responsive to CFA than wild-type TRPV1, whereas the I585V variant was ∼40% less responsive. Reduced sensitivity of the I585V variant was observed at multiple CFA concentrations (Fig. 1C). Results in Fig. 1 showing variations in TRPV1 activation among the I315M, T469I, and I585V variants could be explained by changes in the level of TRPV1 expression, unique subcellular localization of the variant proteins, or inherent changes in protein function. Fig. 2A shows that the expression of mRNA for the I315M, T469I, and I585V forms of TRPV1 were 1.4–3-fold greater than for wild-type TRPV1 in HEK-293 cells, similar to that reported by Xu et al. (44.Xu H. Tian W. Fu Y. Oyama T.T. Anderson S. Cohen D.M. Functional effects of nonsynonymous polymorphisms in the human TRPV1 gene.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1865-F1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that there was ∼20–30% lower expression of TRPV1-I585V and -T469I protein compared with wild-type TRPV1 and I315M despite the increase in mRNA. No major changes in the proportion of calcium flux attributable to intracellular versus cell surface TRPV1 were observed between the wild-type and variant proteins; ∼90% of capsaicin-induced calcium flux for wild type, I315M, and T469I was inhibited using the cell-impermeable inhibitors EGTA and ruthenium red, and ∼82% of capsaicin-induced calcium flux was inhibited for I585V (data not shown). The possibility that the TRPV1-I585V variant altered the expression levels and/or functional properties of wild-type TRPV1 was also assessed. Transfection of HEK-293 cells with an equal quantity of plasmid DNA harboring either TRPV1-WT or TRPV1-I585V or co-transfecting cells with a 1:1 ratio of plasmid DNA for the TRPV1-WT and TRPV1-I585V demonstrated an increase in the overall expression of TRPV1 mRNA relative to cells transfected with wild-type TRPV1 alone (Fig. 2A, gray bar). As in Fig. 2B, TRPV1 protein expression in cells co-expressing TRPV1-WT/WT-green fluorescent protein (GFP) or TRPV1-I585V/WT-GFP was also slightly (∼10–15%) reduced as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 2C). Finally, cells transfected with both wild-type TRPV1 and TRPV1-I585V were ∼40% less responsive to CFA as seen with TRPV1-I585V alone but not capsaicin (Fig. 2D). Agonist-induced and calcium-dependent desensitization/cellular internalization of TRPV1 (27.Sanz-Salvador L. Andrés-Borderia A. Ferrer-Montiel A. Planells-Cases R. Agonist- and Ca2+-dependent desensitization of TRPV1 channel targets the receptor to lysosomes for degradation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19462-19471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was also evaluated (Fig. 3). HEK-293 cells expressing TRPV1-WT-GFP and untagged TRPV1-WT exhibited increases in intracellular vesicles containing GFP within 20 min of capsaicin treatment (Fig. 3A; quantified in Fig. 3B). This response was substantially lesser in cells treated with CFA even at 2 h post-treatment (Fig. 3, B and C), consistent with CFA being a much weaker TRPV1 agonist than capsaicin. When cells expressing both TRPV1-WT-GFP and untagged TRPV1-I585V were treated with capsaicin, a ∼25% decrease in cellular internalization of TRPV1 was observed compared with TRPV1-WT-GFP/TRPV1-WT-transfected cells. With CFA, a ∼60% decrease in the internalization response was observed, consistent with I585V being preferentially less responsive to CFA. IL-8 is a common acute phase response protein secreted by lung epithelial cells treated with PM such as CFA. Primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells expressing either wild-type TRPV1 (I585I) or TRPV1-I585I/V (heterozygotes) exhibited dose-dependent increases in IL-8 accumulation in the culture medium following 24-h treatment with CFA. The response of the TRPV1-I585I/V cells was ∼30–60% lower depending upon the dose for both capsaicin and CFA (Fig. 4A). IL-8 mRNA expression mirrored the results for IL-8 protein (Fig. 4B). The expression levels of TRPV1 and other TRP channels in TRPV1-WT and TRPV1-I585I/V NHBE cells was also investigated via RNA sequencing analysis (Fig. 5A). The expression of mRNA for TRPV1 and many other TRP channels was not significantly altered as a result of the I585I/V genotype or agonist treatments. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting analysis demonstrated a slightly (∼30%) lower, although not statistically significant, level of TRPV1 protein in I585I/V cells (Fig. 5, B–D), similar to but greater in magnitude than that observed in WT-GFP/I585V-co-transfected HEK-293 cells (Fig. 2C). However, cells expressing the TRPV1-I585I/V variant expressed significantly higher TRPA1 mRNA (∼10-fold wild type; Fig. 5, A and E). The effect of I315M, T469I, and I585V SNPs on asthma control was evaluated in a cohort of children with asthma. General characteristics of the cohort are provided in Table 1. Genomic DNA samples were genotyped for I315M (n = 1179), T469I (n = 1226), and I585V (n = 1270) among other SNPs. The minor allelic and genotype frequencies for I315M, T469I, and I585V are shown in Table 2. The minor allele frequencies for I315M and T469I were comparable with those reported in the literature, whereas I585V was ∼5% more frequent in the overall cohort. However, all three SNPs were enriched 10–20% in the more severe electronic Asthma Tracker (eAT) population. For the I585V variant, there were also substantial differences in the percentages of patients with poorly controlled/severe asthma: for asthma control scores of 0–2, 41.6% of subjects were I585I/V versus 46.7% for subjects with scores of 3–12 and 64.7% for scores >13. Accordingly, the percentages of subjects with wild-type TRPV1 and I585V/V were lower among individuals with poor asthma contro"

https://openalex.org/W2537116898,"'Neolithization' pathway refers to the development of adaptations that characterized subsequent Neolithic life, sedentary occupations, and agriculture. In the Levant, the origins of these human behaviors are widely argued to have emerged during the Early Epipaleolithic (ca. 23 ka cal BP). Consequently, there has been a pre-occupation with identifying and modeling the dietary shift to cereal and grains during this period, which is considered to have been a key development that facilitated increasing sedentism and, eventually, agriculture. Yet, direct evidence of plant use in the form of macrobotanical remains is extremely limited at Epipaleolithic sites and the expected 'Neolithization' pathway has not been robustly demonstrated. However, new direct microbotanical phytolith evidence from the large aggregation site of Kharaneh IV, in the Azraq Basin, suggests that increasingly settled occupation was not the result of wild grass and cereal use, but rather the result of a typical hunter-gatherer balance, based on the use of mostly reliable resources supplemented by some risky resources. Moreover, and illustrating this balance, the direct botanical evidence emphases the importance of the wetlands as an under-recognized reliable plant resource. Significantly, the use of these reliable wetland plant resources at Kharaneh IV represents an unexpected 'Neolithization' pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2531338994,"The acquisition of beige adipocyte features by white fat cells corresponds to protection against obesity-induced metabolic diseases in humans and animal models of type 2 diabetes. In adipose tissue, expression of the E2 small ubiquitin-like modifier ligase ubiquitin carrier protein 9 (Ubc9) is positively correlated with markers of insulin resistance and corresponds with impaired browning of human white adipocytes. However, the molecular regulation of Ubc9 expression in adipocytes and other cells remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the mRNA and protein expression of Ubc9 are regulated by the microRNA miRNA-30a (miR-30a) in human subcutaneous adipocytes. Ubc9 and miR-30a exhibit inverse expression in adipose tissue, with miR-30a robustly elevated in brown fat. Depletion of Ubc9 by siRNA or enforced expression of a miR-30a mimic augments mitochondrial volume and respiration in human white adipocytes, reflecting features of brown fat cells. Furthermore, Ubc9 depletion induces a brown fat gene program in human subcutaneous adipocytes. Induction of the beige-selective gene program corresponds to stabilization of the PR domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) protein, an obligate transcriptional regulator of the brown/beige fat metabolic program in white adipocytes that interacts with Ubc9. Taken together, our data demonstrate a previously unappreciated molecular axis that controls browning of human white adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2529441035,"Previous research has indicated that long-chain fatty acids can bind myoglobin (Mb) in an oxygen-dependent manner. This suggests that oxy-Mb may play an important role in fuel delivery in Mb-rich muscle fibers (e.g. type I fibers and cardiomyocytes), and raises the possibility that Mb also serves as an acylcarnitine-binding protein. We report for the first time the putative interaction and affinity characteristics for different chain lengths of both fatty acids and acylcarnitines with oxy-Mb using molecular dynamic simulations and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. We found that short- to medium-chain fatty acids or acylcarnitines (ranging from C2:0 to C10:0) fail to achieve a stable conformation with oxy-Mb. Furthermore, our results indicate that C12:0 is the minimum chain length essential for stable binding of either fatty acids or acylcarnitines with oxy-Mb. Importantly, the empirical lipid binding studies were consistent with structural modeling. These results reveal that: (i) the lipid binding affinity for oxy-Mb increases as the chain length increases (i.e. C12:0 to C18:1), (ii) the binding affinities of acylcarnitines are higher when compared with their respective fatty acid counterparts, and (iii) both fatty acids and acylcarnitines bind to oxy-Mb in 1:1 stoichiometry. Taken together, our results support a model in which oxy-Mb is a novel regulator of long-chain acylcarnitine and fatty acid pools in Mb-rich tissues. This has important implications for physiological fuel management during exercise, and relevance to pathophysiological conditions (e.g. fatty acid oxidation disorders and cardiac ischemia) where long-chain acylcarnitine accumulation is evident. Previous research has indicated that long-chain fatty acids can bind myoglobin (Mb) in an oxygen-dependent manner. This suggests that oxy-Mb may play an important role in fuel delivery in Mb-rich muscle fibers (e.g. type I fibers and cardiomyocytes), and raises the possibility that Mb also serves as an acylcarnitine-binding protein. We report for the first time the putative interaction and affinity characteristics for different chain lengths of both fatty acids and acylcarnitines with oxy-Mb using molecular dynamic simulations and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. We found that short- to medium-chain fatty acids or acylcarnitines (ranging from C2:0 to C10:0) fail to achieve a stable conformation with oxy-Mb. Furthermore, our results indicate that C12:0 is the minimum chain length essential for stable binding of either fatty acids or acylcarnitines with oxy-Mb. Importantly, the empirical lipid binding studies were consistent with structural modeling. These results reveal that: (i) the lipid binding affinity for oxy-Mb increases as the chain length increases (i.e. C12:0 to C18:1), (ii) the binding affinities of acylcarnitines are higher when compared with their respective fatty acid counterparts, and (iii) both fatty acids and acylcarnitines bind to oxy-Mb in 1:1 stoichiometry.

Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) 5The abbreviations used are: LCFAs, long-chain fatty acids; MD, molecular dynamics; FA, fatty acids; AC, acylcarnitines; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; oxy-Mb, oxymyoglobin; Met-Mb, metmyoglobin; deoxy-Mb, deoxymyoglobin; FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; IMCL, intramyocellular lipid; r.m.s. fluctuation, root mean square fluctuation; PLM, palmitate; PLC, palmitoylcarnitine. serve as an important fuel source for muscle cells, especially Type I “oxidative” muscle fibers and cardiomyocytes (1.Randle P.J. Regulatory interactions between lipids and carbohydrates: the glucose fatty acid cycle after 35 years.Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Efficient fat combustion requires coincident delivery of fuel and O2 to mitochondria, with their subsequent metabolic conversions driven by energy demand. On a molecular scale, intracellular trafficking of lipophilic metabolites through a hydrophilic environment presents an interesting problem. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) have been identified in a variety of cells that solubilize, traffic, and transiently sequester LCFAs (2.Chmurzyńska A.

Characteristics of fatty acid-binding proteins and their relation to mammary-derived growth inhibitor.Mol. Cell Biochem. 1990; 98: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this manner, the FABPs help regulate LCFA availability for metabolism and generation of lipid second messengers. Specifically, LCFAs are substrates for acyl-CoA synthetases that activate LCFAs to their CoA esters. These activated moieties flow toward mitochondrial or peroxisomal catabolism, mono-/di-/triacylglycerol synthesis, or metabolism to other derivatives such as ceramides. Acylcarnitines of various chain lengths are formed from a carnitine molecule and their specific fatty acyl-CoA precursors through the actions of acylcarnitine transferases associated with mitochondria and peroxisomes (9.Sharma S. Black S.M. Carnitine homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and cardiovascular disease.Drug Discov. Today Dis. Mech. 2009; 6: e31-e39Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Importantly, the LCFA availability in muscle can exceed oxidative capacity, and this mismatch, as reflected in plasma or tissue concentrations of acylcarnitine markers of incomplete LCFA β-oxidation, is more apparent during exercise (58.Zhang J. Light A.R. Hoppel C.L. Campbell C. Chandler C.J. Burnett D.J. Souza E.C. Casazza G.A. Hughen R.W. Keim N.L. Newman J.W. Hunter G.R. Fernandez J.R. Garvey W.T.

Muoio D.M. Mitochondrial overload and incomplete fatty acid oxidation contribute to skeletal muscle insulin resistance.Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Under the latter condition, LCFA accumulation in intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) is evident and IMCL content also correlates with insulin resistance in untrained individuals (12.McGarry J.D. Banting lecture 2001: dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.Diabetes. 2002; 51: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Interestingly, aerobic training leads to the “athlete's paradox” in which IMCL is increased despite excellent insulin sensitivity in muscle (13.Dubé J.J. Amati F. Stefanovic-Racic M. Toledo F.G. Sauers S.E. Goodpaster B.H. Exercise-induced alterations in intramyocellular lipids and insulin resistance: the athlete's paradox revisited.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 294: E882-E888Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This contrast between trained and untrained individuals is hypothesized to derive from efficient sequestration of fatty acids into triacylglycerol, where they remain relatively “inert,” thus limiting accumulation of “lipotoxic” intermediates such as ceramides or diacylgylcerols (14.Aon M.A. Bhatt N. Cortassa S.C. Mitochondrial and cellular mechanisms for managing lipid excess.Front. Physiol. 2014; 5: 282Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, additional possibilities may be at work including training-associated changes in the expression and/or post-translational modification of sequestration proteins. Besides being a well-known marker of incomplete β-oxidation, recent studies highlight the multifunctional role that LCFA-acylcarnitines play in the cell. These lipid moieties serve as natural zwitterions that modify membrane-associated systems or enzymes. In turn, these changes can contribute to insulin resistance, inflammation, and myocyte stress responses relevant to cardiac ischemia and inborn errors of fatty acid oxidation (15.Rutkowsky J.M. Knotts T.A. Ono-Moore K.D. McCoin C.S. Huang S. Schneider D. Singh S. Adams S.H. Hwang D.H. Acylcarnitines activate proinflammatory signaling pathways.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Acylcarnitines, old actors auditioning for new roles in metabolic physiology.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2015; 11: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of acylcarnitines in terms of normal cellular and body-wide fuel metabolism, and their possible involvement in myocellular function (or dysfunction, when in excess), little is known about myocyte acylcarnitine trafficking and sequestration. Myoglobin (Mb) is a single polypeptide of ∼153 amino acids length. Mb is one of the most abundant proteins in muscle and cardiomyocytes (18.Nelson D. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Worth Publishers, New York2000Google Scholar) and its concentrations in muscle are increased by aerobic training (19.Terjung R.L. Muscle adaptations to aerobic training.Sports Science Exchange. 1995; 8: 1-4Google Scholar). Mb has eight right-handed α-helices that are arranged in a distorted bundle orientation or a triangular prism shape structure (20.Kendrew J.C. Bodo G. Dintzis H.M. Parrish R.G. Wyckoff H. Phillips D.C. A three-dimensional model of the myoglobin molecule obtained by x-ray analysis.Nature. 1958; 181: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 21.Vinogradov S.N. Walz D.A. Pohajdak B. Moens L. Kapp O.H. Suzuki T. Trotman C.N. Adventitious variability? the amino acid sequences of nonvertebrate globins.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1993; 106: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar22.Suzuki T. Imai K. Evolution of myoglobin.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 979-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The arrangement of the protein is highly compact and contains a heme group (i.e. porphyrin ring with iron at its center), where the heme is held by a proximal histidine group attached directly to iron. A distal histidine group placed on the opposite side of heme is not bonded to iron; rather, it is involved in binding small molecular ligands (20.Kendrew J.C. Bodo G. Dintzis H.M. Parrish R.G. Wyckoff H. Phillips D.C. A three-dimensional model of the myoglobin molecule obtained by x-ray analysis.Nature. 1958; 181: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). The heme is surrounded by the neighboring non-polar amino acids in the interior of the Mb. This compact nature of Mb allows only a few small molecules to reach its interior. Molecular O2, being non-polar, freely diffuses into the interior of the protein and binds to the heme iron. Binding of O2 changes the Mb conformation by pulling the iron into the heme plane (i.e. in deoxy-Mb the Fe is out of the heme plane). Hence, O2 binding alters the orientation of the proximal histidine, resulting in a conformational change in the helix F of oxy-Mb. A growing body of evidence points to Mb as a protein involved in binding LCFAs in an oxygen-dependent manner (23.Chintapalli S.V. Bhardwaj G. Patel R. Shah N. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

Fatty acid binding of myoglobin depends on its oxygenation.Biological chemistry Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In support, biochemical and NMR studies have demonstrated the in vitro interaction between oxy-Mb and palmitate or oleate (26.Sriram R. Kreutzer U. Shih L. Jue T. Interaction of fatty acid with myoglobin.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27.Shih L. Chung Y. Sriram R. Jue T.

Interaction of myoglobin with oleic acid.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2015; 191: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Recently, our group utilized molecular dynamic structural modeling to identify the putative binding site and key amino acid residues involved in fatty acid binding to oxy-Mb, but not deoxy-Mb (23.Chintapalli S.V. Bhardwaj G. Patel R. Shah N. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Anishkin A. Adams S.H. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal the structural determinants of fatty acid binding to oxy-myoglobin.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0128496Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although it has been proposed that fatty acid binding to Mb is promoted with unsaturation and increases as a function of chain length (25.Götz F.M. Hertel M. Gröschel-Stewart U. Fatty acid binding of myoglobin depends on its oxygenation.Biological chemistry Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the full range of fatty acids bound by oxy-Mb remains to be determined. Nevertheless, these observations raise the intriguing possibility that Mb helps regulate LCFA oxidative versus non-oxidative fates under dynamic physiological states (i.e. rest versus exercise) and/or contrasting metabolic health conditions (i.e. fit insulin-sensitive versus sedentary insulin-resistant states). In other words, Mb may be an integral part of the network of players that modulate physiologic and lipotoxic outcomes in muscle cells. Given the LCFA and oxy-Mb interactions, it is reasonable to consider that oxy-Mb may bind acylcarnitines in a chain length-specific manner as well. It is further reasoned that due to the carnitine headgroup, the binding characteristics will differ from LCFA due to polar interactions at the interface between the oxy-Mb hydrophobic pocket and the outside of the protein. To evaluate these hypotheses, we determined the chain length specificity of fatty acid and fatty acylcarnitine binding to oxy-Mb versus deoxy-Mb utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. Our findings support a heretofore unrecognized role of Mb in the acylcarnitine pathway and contribute to the understanding of the structural determinants, dynamics, and stability of different chain lengths and ligands with differing unsaturation. In our previous study using MD simulations, we showed the mechanistic features predicting the ligand binding site, ligand interactions, and effect(s) of oxygen binding on the heme structure that enables fatty acid binding (i.e. palmitate or oleate) to oxy-Mb but not to deoxy-Mb (23.Chintapalli S.V. Bhardwaj G. Patel R. Shah N. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Anishkin A. Adams S.H. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal the structural determinants of fatty acid binding to oxy-myoglobin.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0128496Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the current study, we performed molecular docking experiments involving varying chain lengths (C2 to C20) of both fatty acids and acylcarnitines to oxy-Mb and deoxy-Mb. Docking results for these ligands with deoxy-Mb showed no favorable binding, consistent with previous MD studies and experimental results with LCFAs (23.Chintapalli S.V. Bhardwaj G. Patel R. Shah N. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Anishkin A. Adams S.H.

Sriram R. Jue T. Palmitate interaction with physiological states of myoglobin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1840: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and C). This lack of interaction is likely due to the effect of the dome-shaped heme and the degree of heme tilting in deoxy-Mb, which is the result of a slight decrease in the coordination bond length between the iron and histidine (Nϵ2 (ϵ nitrogen of His) and the imidazole ring) (29.Takano T.

Biol. 1977; 110: 569-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). For the oxy-Mb simulations, our present results accord with our previous docking outcomes. Both LCFAs and long-chain acylcarnitines exhibit similar binding modes, in that they bind near the porphyrin group and the hydrophobic region of the protein (Fig. 1, B and D). Specifically, the carboxyl headgroup of the fatty acid or acylcarnitine interacts with the side chain amino group of Lys45 and Lys63, whereas the lipid tail region exhibits hydrophobic contacts. Estimated binding energies predicted by Autodock (see Table 1) were lower for the short- and medium-chain fatty acids and their respective acylcarnitines (i.e. C2 to C10 values less than −4 kcal/mol), when compared with LCFA and long-chain acylcarnitines. Overall, we found that C2-C10 metabolite binding was not stable (discussed below).TABLE 1Estimated binding energy (BE) results for different chain lengths of both FAs and ACs with oxy-Mb from AutoDockLengthNameEstimated BEFAsACsFAsACskcal/molC2:0AceticAcetyl−3.54−3.77C4:0ButyricButyroyl−3.61−3.81C6:0CaproicCaproyl−3.72−3.85C8:0CaprylicCapryloyl−3.84−3.93C10:0CapricCaprioyl−3.90−4.01C12:0LauricLauroyl−4.52−5.03C14:0MyristicMyristoyl−4.75−5.97C16:0PalmiticPalmitoyl−5.99−6.16C18:1OleicOleoyl−6.09−6.43C20:4ArachidonicArachidonoyl−6.81−7.33 Open table in a new tab Our recent study, using MD simulations of oxy-Mb complexed with palmitate and oleate, illustrated the crucial role of the fatty acid hydrophobic tail in stabilizing the entire protein-lipid complex (23.Chintapalli S.V. Bhardwaj G. Patel R. Shah N. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Anishkin A. Adams S.H. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal the structural determinants of fatty acid binding to oxy-myoglobin.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0128496Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to understand the structural stability of the protein-lipid complex for different chain lengths of ligands as well as the effect of the carnitine headgroup in binding. Therefore, we carried out 100-ns MD simulations separately for each protein-lipid complex (12 fatty acids and 12 acylcarnitines in total). In addition, we also performed simulations using arachidonate or arachidonoylcarnitine (C20:4) to understand the effects of polyunsaturation on binding dynamics, due to the presence of four double bonds. In all cases, the starting structure has the carboxyl group of the lipid interacting with Lys45 and Lys63 of Mb enabling hydrogen bonding. Analysis of the trajectories for short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines revealed that the ligand starts to move out of the binding site within the first 10-ns simulation time and is thereafter exposed to the hydrophilic environment (Fig. 2, A–C, illustrating C4, butyroylcarnitine). Similar outcomes were observed for either fatty acid or acylcarnitine molecules ranging from C2:0 to C10:0 chain length. In other words, there was essentially no binding of either ligand with chain lengths up to C10:0 to oxy-Mb under the conditions tested, as the tail is too short to have stable hydrophobic interactions. For both fatty acids and acylcarnitines, C12:0 is the minimum chain length required to form a stable complex with oxy-Mb (Fig. 3, A and F).FIGURE 3.Structure of horse oxy-Mb interacting with fatty acids.

Bhardwaj G. Patel R. Shah N. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Anishkin A. Adams S.H. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal the structural determinants of fatty acid binding to oxy-myoglobin.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0128496Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), stable interactions were seen between the non-polar alkyl tail of LCFAs and hydrophobic residues Leu29, Phe33, Phe43, Phe46, Val67, Val68, and Ile107 within oxy-Mb. Conversely, the current MD trajectories on short- and medium-chain lipids reveal a failure to exhibit hydrophobic interactions during the course of the simulation run. This is due to the fact that these short tails do not interact with the deeper-sitting hydrophobic residues described above, nor are the interactions strong enough to resist thermal fluctuations and hold the ligands in the hydrophobic groove. Moreover, when a short-tail ligand emerges from the pocket, it lacks a few terminal carbons that would coordinate the tail at the pocket entrance to facilitate the return. Eventually, the short tail region moves far enough out of the pocket, ultimately leading to the dissociation from Mb. This is in sharp contrast with the long-chain lipid moieties in that binding and retention are long lasting. For example, palmitoylcarnitine is stabilized in the hydrophobic pocket, thereby forming hydrogen bonds; its “U”-shaped tail interacts with the conserved hydrophobic residues of Mb (Fig. 2, D–F). The energetic reason for the long-chain hydrophobic tail occupying the hydrophobic groove is its highly nonpolar nature, which drives penetration away from the aqueous environment outside of the Mb molecule. In contrast, the fatty tails of short- and medium-chain lipids (C2:0 to C10:0) are not pushed into the crevice because the hydrophobic forces are roughly proportional to the exposed nonpolar area. In MD simulations, the carboxyl headgroup in LCFA and long-chain acylcarnitines (i.e. C12 or longer) exhibited hydrogen-bonding interactions with Lys45 or Lys63. The results showed that these headgroups switched between Lys45 and Lys63 during the 100-ns simulation, with an average dwelling time on the order of 25 ns. During the 100-ns simulations, the majority of the H-bonding is associated with Lys45, with some exceptions (Fig. 4). Overall, we find that the headgroup of fatty acids tend to show a higher percentage of hydrogen bonding with Lys45 or Lys63 than their respective acylcarnitines (Fig. 4). In addition to this difference, the NH3+ moiety in the carnitine headgroup also shows interactions with residues Lys42, Lys47, Ser58, His64, and His97. Comparative visual analysis of various ligands (C12 and above) in the hydrophobic pocket of oxy-Mb revealed interesting features. Laurate exhibited “linear” shape conformation throughout the 100-ns simulation run, whereas lauroylcarnitine switched between a linear and U-shaped conformation before attaining a final U shape structure (Fig. 3A). In contrast, myristate, myristoylcarnitine, palmitate, palmitoylcarnitine, oleate, and oleylcarnitine exhibit the characteristic U-shaped conformation similar to the binding conformation in the FABP proteins (Fig. 3, panels B–D and F–I) (31.He Y.

Due to the presence of the single double bond at the center of the molecule in both oleate and oleoylcarnitine (formation of kink in the structure due to the cis bond between C9 and C10), these two ligands always display U shape conformation.

https://openalex.org/W2529719920,"Large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels play essential roles in both excitable and non-excitable cells. For example, in chondrocytes, agonist-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular store activates BK channels, and this hyperpolarizes these cells, augments Ca2+ entry, and forms a positive feed-back mechanism for Ca2+ signaling and stimulation-secretion coupling. In the present study, functional roles of a newly identified splice variant in the BK channel α subunit (BKαΔe2) were examined in a human chondrocyte cell line, OUMS-27, and in a HEK293 expression system. Although BKαΔe2 lacks exon2, which codes the intracellular S0-S1 linker (Glu-127–Leu-180), significant expression was detected in several tissues from humans and mice. Molecular image analyses revealed that BKαΔe2 channels are not expressed on plasma membrane but can traffic to the plasma membrane after forming hetero-tetramer units with wild-type BKα (BKαWT). Single-channel current analyses demonstrated that BKα hetero-tetramers containing one, two, or three BKαΔe2 subunits are functional. These hetero-tetramers have a smaller single channel conductance and exhibit lower trafficking efficiency than BKαWT homo-tetramers in a stoichiometry-dependent manner. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in exon2 identified Helix2 and the linker to S1 (Trp-158–Leu-180, particularly Arg-178) as an essential segment for channel function including voltage dependence and trafficking. BKαΔe2 knockdown in OUMS-27 chondrocytes increased BK current density and augmented the responsiveness to histamine assayed as cyclooxygenase-2 gene expression. These findings provide significant new evidence that BKαΔe2 can modulate cellular responses to physiological stimuli in human chondrocyte and contribute under pathophysiological conditions, such as osteoarthritis.

Changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) are essential elements of an intracellular second messenger for a wide variety of cellular functions.

These BK currents strongly regulate essential physiological responses by hyperpolarizing the membrane potential (1.Guéguinou M. Chantôme A. Fromont G. Bougnoux P. Vandier C. Potier-Cartereau M. KCa and Ca2+ channels: the complex thought.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843: 2322-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Each BK channel consists of pore-forming α subunits (BKα) arranged as tetramers that act in conjunction with tissue specific regulatory β and/or γ subunits (2.Contreras G.F. Castillo K. Enrique N. Carrasquel-Ursulaez W. Castillo J.P. Milesi V. Neely A. Alvarez O. Ferreira G. González C. Latorre R. A BK (Slo1) channel journey from molecule to physiology.Channels. 2013; 7: 442-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Functional diversity of BK channels can also be conferred by alternative splicing of either BKα or BKβ mRNA (3.Chen L. Jeffries O. Rowe I.C. Liang Z. Knaus H.G. Ruth P. Shipston M.J. Membrane trafficking of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels is regulated by alternative splicing of a transplantable, acidic trafficking motif in the RCK1-RCK2 linker.J. Biol.

Control of alternative splicing of potassium channels by stress hormones.Science. 1998; 280: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). For example, the C terminus of the BKα subunit contains alternative splicing sites, C1 and C2 (3.Chen L. Jeffries O. Rowe I.C. Liang Z. Knaus H.G. Ruth P. Shipston M.J. Membrane trafficking of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels is regulated by alternative splicing of a transplantable, acidic trafficking motif in the RCK1-RCK2 linker.J. Biol.

A well documented splice variant of BKα is the stress-regulated exon (STREX), which can be induced by stress hormones such as corticoids (4.Xie J. McCobb D.P. Control of alternative splicing of potassium channels by stress hormones.Science. 1998; 280: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative forms of BKα subunit have also been discovered. The SV1 variant, which has an ER retention signal (CVLF motif) between the S0 and S1 region, can bind to wild-type BKα and prevent its translocation to PM (5.Zarei M.M. Eghbali M. Alioua A. Song M. Knaus H.G. Stefani E. Toro L. An endoplasmic reticulum trafficking signal prevents surface expression of a voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ channel splice variant.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, the hSloΔ579–664 variant lacks exon18, 19, and 23, coding the ER exit signal motif and, therefore, cannot traffic to the PM (3.Chen L. Jeffries O. Rowe I.C. Liang Z. Knaus H.G. Ruth P.

Articular cartilage consists mainly of chondrocytes and their secretion products that form the extracellular matrix (type-ΙΙ collagen and proteoglycans). Their ability to synthesize and release lubricants is essential for normal joint movement. Chondrocytes are exposed to a number of different stimuli including mechanical stress and osmotic and ionic changes in the synovial fluid (6.Lewis R. Feetham C.H. Barrett-Jolley R. Cell volume regulation in chondrocytes.Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2011; 28: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In response to these stimuli, chondrocytes alter the extracellular matrix to maintain homeostasis. Various types of ion channels are expressed in chondrocytes (7.Barrett-Jolley R. Lewis R. Fallman R. Mobasheri A. The emerging chondrocyte channelome.Front Physiol. 2010; 1: 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), where they regulate membrane potential and modulate [Ca2+]i (8.Funabashi K. Ohya S. Yamamura H. Hatano N. Muraki K. Giles W. Imaizumi Y. Accelerated Ca2+ entry by membrane hyperpolarization due to Ca2+-activated K+ channel activation in response to histamine in chondrocytes.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 298: C786-C797Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Changes in [Ca2+]i modulate chondrogenesis, proliferation, cell death (9.Kurita T. Yamamura H. Suzuki Y. Giles W.R. Imaizumi Y. The ClC-7 chloride channel Is down-regulated by hypoosmotic stress in human chondrocytes.Mol. Pharmacol. 2015; 88: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and baseline anabolic and catabolic activities in chondrocytes. Under pathophysiological conditions, such as osteoarthritis (OA), histamine release from resident mast cells enhances production of proinflammatory mediators and matrix degrading enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases). Histamine can also alter the proliferation of chondrocytes in articular joints. Specific spatial and temporal patterns of changes in [Ca2+]i are considered essential components of disease initiation and progression. In a well studied model cell of the human chondrocyte, OUMS-27 cells, BK channels (as well as other Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channels) are functionally expressed. BK channels are involved in enhancement of histamine-induced Ca2+ influx after membrane hyperpolarization (8.Funabashi K. Ohya S. Yamamura H. Hatano N. Muraki K. Giles W. Imaizumi Y. Accelerated Ca2+ entry by membrane hyperpolarization due to Ca2+-activated K+ channel activation in response to histamine in chondrocytes.Am. J. Physiol.

Orai1-Orai2 complex is involved in store-operated calcium entry in chondrocyte cell lines.Cell Calcium. 2015; 57: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). BK channels also act as mechano-sensing elements in chondrocytes, as judged by their sensitivity to hypo-osmotic challenges (11.Mobasheri A. Lewis R. Maxwell J.E. Hill C. Womack M. Barrett-Jolley R. Characterization of a stretch-activated potassium channel in chondrocytes.J. Cell Physiol. 2010; 223: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The BK channel expression is up-regulated in patients with progressive OA (12.Karlsson C. Dehne T. Lindahl A. Brittberg M. Pruss A. Sittinger M. Ringe J. Genome-wide expression profiling reveals new candidate genes associated with osteoarthritis.Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2010; 18: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For these reasons, BK channels are thought to be involved in physiological and/or pathological regulation of chondrocyte function. We have identified a novel BKα splice variant (BKαΔe2: AB524033.1) in OUMS-27 cells. The present study was undertaken to identify the molecular details of this novel variant and define its functional roles in chondrocytes. Our data demonstrate that this BKαΔe2 splice variant can negatively regulate functional expression of BK channels and modulate essential cellular functions, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) gene expression, in chondrocytes. A novel splice variant of BKα, which is 54 amino acids shorter than wild-type BKα (BKαWT), was cloned (supplemental Fig. S1) from an OUMS-27 human chondrocyte cell line. This variant lacks a region encoded by exon2 (Glu127–Leu180) corresponding to the latter part of S0-S1 linker (Trp108–Arg178) and first two amino acid residues (Val179 and Leu180) of S1 segment (Val179–Ser199) (BKαΔe2, Fig. 1A). Recently NMR analysis revealed that the S0-S1 loop contains two short α-helix (Helix1 and Helix2) (13.Shi P. Li D. Lai C. Zhang L. Tian C. Intracellular segment between transmembrane helices S0 and S1 of BK channel alpha subunit contains two amphipathic helices connected by a flexible loop.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 437: 408-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the deletion of exon2 does not disrupt the overall hydrophobicity pattern of S1 segment of BKαΔe2. Instead, it alters hydrophilic region and the Helix2 in S0-S1 loop. RT-PCR analysis establishes that this BKαΔe2-splice variant is expressed in OUMS-27 cells, human cartilage from both healthy and OA specimens (Fig. 1C, see supplemental Table S1 for primer information). Expression of BKαΔe2 mRNA has also been detected in other human tissues, such as heart and lymph node (Fig. 1C). In addition, quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis revealed relatively high expression of BKαΔe2 in OUMS-27, a well studied human chondrocyte cell line (relative expression to WT: 0.14 ± 0.03, n = 4) and trachea and aorta from mice (0.08 ± 0.03 and 0.12 ± 0.04, n = 4 each; Fig. 1D). To evaluate whether BKαΔe2 can form functional channels, this transcript was labeled with a FLAG tag at its extracellular N terminus and also by mCherry (mCh) at the intracellular C terminus and then transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. BK-mediated currents were assessed using whole-cell patch clamp technique. When the pCa of pipette filling solution was 6.5, cells expressing BKαWT exhibited paxilline (Pax, a specific BK channel blocker)-sensitive currents; in contrast, BKαΔe2-transfected cells did not (Fig. 2, A and B). As shown in Fig. 2C, the unitary current amplitude (measured using inside-out patch clamp recordings) was 11.5 ± 0.9 pA at +50 mV (4 single channel recordings) in HEK293 cells expressing BKαWT, but no single channel current was detected from cells expressing BKαΔe2 (5 recordings). Both whole-cell and inside-out path-clamp recordings were obtained using cells co-transfected with BKαWT and BKαΔe2. Whole-cell BKαWT currents were markedly attenuated by co-expression of BKαΔe2 (WT: Δe2 = 1:3) (Fig. 2, D and E, p < 0.01 at +100 mV). Ratio-dependent inhibition by co-transfection of BKαΔe2 cDNA with BKαWT cDNA was examined using HEK293 cells. Constant amounts of BKαWT cDNA (50 ng) and variable amounts of BKαΔe2 cDNA (5, 50, and 150 ng, respectively) were applied for co-transfection to make cDNA ratio (WT:Δe2) 1:0.1, 1:1 and 1:3. HEK293 cells transfected with mock vector instead of BKαΔe2 cDNA (WT:Δe2 = 1:0) were used as a control (288.7 ± 35.9 pA/pF at +120 mV, 7 cells). As shown in supplemental Fig. S2, the co-transfection of BKαΔe2 cDNA with BKαWT cDNA suppressed the whole-cell BK channel currents in a ratio-dependent manner (BK channel currents at +120 mV: (1:0.1) 176.1 ± 37.5 pA/pF, 9 cells; (1:1) 97.6 ± 25.8 pA/pF, 7 cells; (1:3) 32.9 pA/pF ± 4.3 pA/pF, 5 cells; p < 0.05 versus control). Thus, application of only 110 amount of BKαΔe2 cDNA actually reduced whole-cell BK channel currents. This result suggests that the relatively small ratio of BKαΔe2 mRNA in OUMS-27 cells (Fig. 1D) may be sufficient to substantially reduce BK channel currents. Unitary currents through single BK channels in HEK293 cells co-expressing BKαWT-GFP (WT-GFP) and BKαWT-mCherry (WT-mCh) were similar to those in Fig. 2C. The averaged single channel conductance of WT-GFP+WT-mCh (WT+WT in Fig. 2, F and G, and supplemental Table S2) was 232.9 ± 3.5 pS (8 recordings, p > 0.05 versus non-labeled WT: 218.0 ± 8.1 pS, 7 recordings). On the other hand, in HEK293 cells co-expressing WT-GFP and BKαΔe2-mCherry (Δe2-mCh) the distribution of unitary current amplitude at +50 mV could be separated into three groups (WT+Δe2 #1, #2, and #3) (Fig. 2, F and G, and supplemental Table S2). The single channel conductance of WT+Δe2 #1 was 236.9 ± 3.9 pS (11 recordings, p > 0.05 versus WT+WT), and that of WT+Δe2 #2 and #3 was 194.7 ± 3.4 pS (9 recordings, p < 0.01 versus WT+WT and WT+Δe2 #1) and 56.6 ± 3.4 pS (10 recordings, p < 0.01 versus WT+WT, WT+Δe2 #1 and #2). The mean open time of WT+Δe2 #3 at +50 mV (4.1 ± 0.5 ms) was also significantly shorter than those of WT+WT (10.3 ± 1.4 ms, p < 0.05), WT+Δe2 #1 (11.7 ± 2.3 ms, p < 0.01) and #2 (13.3 ± 2.2 ms, p < 0.01). In summary, BKαΔe2 can form hetero-tetramers with BKαWT that yield functional channels which have smaller single channel conductance and shorter mean open time than the corresponding homo-tetrameric BKαWT channels. Based on the conductance shown above, it is apparent that WT+Δe2 #1 corresponds to WT homo-tetramer. However, the stoichiometry in #2 and #3 is unclear. The stoichiometry of functional BKαWT/BKαΔe2 hetero-tetramers was examined based on data from studies using tetraethylammonium (TEA, a BK channel blocker) as a pharmacological tool. It has been reported that when tyrosine residue at 359 in BKαWT is replaced with valine (BKαY359V), the resulting variant is insensitive to TEA (Fig. 3A) (14.Niu X. Magleby K.L. Stepwise contribution of each subunit to the cooperative activation of BK channels by Ca2+.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11441-11446Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When BKαY359V-mCh and BKαWT-GFP are co-expressed in HEK293 cells (WT(Y359V)+WT), unitary current amplitude in the presence of 2 mm TEA increased in approximate proportion to the number of BKαY359V subunits within a BKα tetramer (predicted number of WT(Y359V) and corresponding unitary currents in WT(Y359V)+WT: one and 1.4 ± 0.1 pA (4 recordings), two and 3.2 ± 0.1 pA (10 recordings), three and 6.6 ± 0.2 pA (5 recordings), four and 9.0 ± 0.2 pA (6 recordings) (Fig. 3, B and C, and supplemental Table S3) (14.Niu X. Magleby K.L. Stepwise contribution of each subunit to the cooperative activation of BK channels by Ca2+.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11441-11446Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In cells co-expressing BKαY359V-mCh and BKαΔe2-GFP (WT(Y359V)+Δe2), unitary current distribution was divided into three groups (group 1: 8.9 ± 0.1 pA (12 recordings); group 2: 6.7 ± 0.2 pA (4 recordings); group 3: 2.9 ± 0.2 pA (4 recordings); Fig. 3, B and C, and supplemental Table S3). Then, it was examined to determine if the mean unitary currents of these three groups matched those of the corresponding groups in WT(Y359V)+WT cells, respectively (Fig. 3C). Statistical analyses denote distributions of single channel currents are equal between two groups having closest mean values (p > 0.05 by F-test). There is no significant difference (p > 0.05 by t test) between each set of three pairs. The appearance rate of hetero-tetramers consisting of BKαY359V and BKαΔe2 (i.e. the sum of the 2:2 and 3:1 hetero-tetramers) was approximately 40%, significantly lower than the BKαY359V and BKαWT hetero-tetramers (1:3, 2:2, and 3:1, approximately 76%, indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 3D). In addition, we found a small population of cells showing robust expression of BKαΔe2 judging from strong GFP fluorescence. Only when membrane patches were excised from some of these cells, small unitary currents corresponding to those of WT/WT(Y359V) = 3:1 were detected (1.5 ± 0.1 pA, 3 recordings, p > 0.05 versus 1.4 ± 0.1 pA of WT/WT(Y359V) = 3:1; Fig. 3, E and F). In summary, WT/Δe2 hetero-tetramers at the stoichiometry of 3:1, 2:2, and 1:3 are functional. WT+Δe2 #2 and #3 correspond to WT/Δe2 = 3:1 and WT/Δe2 = 2:2, respectively. To complement and extend our electrophysiological findings, these same BKα hetero-tetramer complexes at the surface membrane were analyzed using confocal microscopy. A non-permeabilized (NP) labeling method was used to identify the BK channels that expressed well only in the surface membrane (PM) (3.Chen L. Jeffries O. Rowe I.C. Liang Z. Knaus H.G. Ruth P. Shipston M.J. Membrane trafficking of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels is regulated by alternative splicing of a transplantable, acidic trafficking motif in the RCK1-RCK2 linker.J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10072-10077Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because the N terminus of BKα is located in extracellular space (Fig. 1A), the N termini of both BKαWT and BKαΔe2 were fused with FLAG tag. In addition, the C termini were tagged with mCh. In HEK293 cells expressing BKαWT, the anti-FLAG antibody detected extracellular FLAG tag fused to BKαWT (Alexa488, Fig. 4A). The anti-FLAG antibody did not recognize FLAG tag conjugated to BKαΔe2; however, after membrane permeabilization, it did so. The ratio of anti-FLAG positive to mCh-positive cells, which indicates the efficiency of trafficking to PM, was ∼0.8 in cells expressing BKαWT. In contrast, this ratio was almost zero in cells expressing BKαΔe2 (Fig. 4B). When BKαWT transcripts labeled with either YFP or CFP were co-expressed in HEK293 cells, the WT-CFP/WT-YFP complex demonstrated distinct and significant co-localization along the PM (Fig. 4C). In contrast, when WT-CFP and Δe2-YFP were co-expressed, both the fraction of WT-CFP in PM versus cytosol (Fig. 4D) and the ratio of WT-CFP co-localized with Δe2-YFP in the PM (Fig. 4E) were much smaller than those in WT-CFP and WT-YFP co-expression, respectively. Moreover, WT-CFP was highly co-localized with BKαΔe2 only in the cytosol (Fig. 4E, p < 0.01 versus WT+WT in PM and WT+Δe2 in cytosol). Thus, hetero-tetramer formation of BKαΔe2 with BKαWT reduces the trafficking efficiency of these complexes to the PM. Heteromeric BKα formation was also examined using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay (10.Inayama M. Suzuki Y. Yamada S. Kurita T. Yamamura H. Ohya S. Giles W.R. Imaizumi Y. Orai1-Orai2 complex is involved in store-operated calcium entry in chondrocyte cell lines.Cell Calcium. 2015; 57: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4F). As shown in Fig. 4F, Venus fluorescence was consistently detected in HEK293 cells that co-expressed BKαΔe2 and BKαWT tagged with N (VN173) and C (VC155) termini of Venus, respectively. To examine further the possible interactions between BKαWT and BKαΔe2, FRET analysis based on an acceptor photobleaching method was also carried out (Fig. 4G) (15.Suzuki Y. Yamamura H. Ohya S. Imaizumi Y. Caveolin-1 facilitates the direct coupling between large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) and Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels and their clustering to regulate membrane excitability in vascular myocytes.J.

FRET was observed consistently in cells that co-expressed WT-YFP and Δe2-CFP. The results from this co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay also demonstrate molecular interaction between BKαΔe2 and BKαWT in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4H). In summary, our analysis shows that BKαΔe2 binds to both BKαWT and BKαΔe2 with similar affinity to form heteromeric molecular complexes. Importantly, however, hetero-tetramer formation of BKαWT with BKαΔe2 reduced the trafficking efficiency. The stoichiometry of BKαWT/BKαΔe2 heteromeric channels was further examined by employing single molecule imaging methods based on TIRF microscopy (15.Suzuki Y. Yamamura H. Ohya S. Imaizumi Y. Caveolin-1 facilitates the direct coupling between large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) and Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels and their clustering to regulate membrane excitability in vascular myocytes.J.

Cell Physiol. 2012; 302: C1257-C1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Under TIRF illumination, the expression of only WT-mCh transcripts resulted in a distinct dotted pattern of signals (Fig. 5A). In contrast, expression of Δe2-GFP alone showed very weak fluorescence signals in the TIRF field, and it exhibited bright fluorescence under epifluorescence microscopy, suggesting mainly intracellular localization. When WT-mCh and Δe2-GFP were co-expressed, some of Δe2-GFP particles could be detected in the PM, where they were co-localized with WT-mCh particles. The combined signals due to mCh and GFP, detected as yellow particles, progressively moved together on the PM during 60-s measurements (Fig. 5A and see also the supplemental movie). This strongly suggests specific hetero-tetramer formation at or very near the PM. The stoichiometry of these hetero-tetramers was also studied using molecular imaging, which quantified the “step down” decrease in fluorescent intensity (a single molecule GFP bleaching method) (15.Suzuki Y.

In this approach: two types of cells co-expressing WT-mCh and WT-GFP or expressing WT-mCh and Δe2-GFP were prepared by transfection of cDNA at a ratio of 1:1. Single spots of WT-GFP, which were detected alone (not with WT-mCh) in cells co-expressing WT-mCh and WT-GFP, displayed mainly 3 or 4 step bleaching (Fig. 5C). The population distribution of the data obtained from this bleaching step analysis was well fitted to the theoretical binomial distribution for a tetramer (n = 4), with the apparent probability of GFP being fluorescent during excitation (p) set at 0.80 (18.Bharill S. Fu Z. Palty R. Isacoff E.Y. Stoichiometry and specific assembly of Best ion channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 6491-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). This result provided evidence that each GFP spot contained single BKαWT tetramer under these conditions. In the secondary analysis, the pattern of bleaching of the GFP spots, which were detected by co-localization of mCh and GFP as yellow signals and assumed to represent heteromers of WT-mCh and Δe2-GFP (circles in Fig. 5B), was counted. Although these spots exhibited bleaching steps corresponding to one to four subunits, the population distribution peaked at two-step bleaching (Fig. 5D). Similarly, the presumed heteromer of WT-GFP and WT-mCh yielded a distribution that peaked at two steps. Both distributions were well fitted by binomial distribution, given n = 4 and apparent fluorescence probability p = 0.5. Here, p = 0.5 is based on the premise that two molecules (A and B) possess the same affinity between A-A, A-B, and B-B, when composing homo- or hetero-tetramer. It is notable that both distributions of WT-GFP/WT-mCh and Δe2-GFP/WT-mCh are peaked at two-step bleaching and well fitted to the theoretical distribution. These results suggest that binding affinity between Δe2-GFP and WT-mCh is comparable with that between WT-GFP and WT-mCh and support the finding by FRET shown in Fig. 4G. Taken together, BKαΔe2 can form tetramers with BKαWT at the stoichiometry of 1:3, 2:2, and 3:1. The region in exon2 that is responsible for surface expression was examined using site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 6A and supplemental Table S4). Channel function and surface expression were measured based on whole-cell patch clamp recordings and anti-FLAG antibody imaging, respectively (see Fig. 2, A and B, Fig. 4, A and B, and supplemental Table S4). Mutants of Δ127–140 (Δ1) and Δ141–150 (Δ2) resulted in BK channel activity that were very similar to BKαWT. Mutations of Δ151–161 (Δ3) showed smaller but significant surface expression and only very little BK channel activity (n = 5). Other variants (Δ162–170 (Δ4), Δ171–178 (Δ5), or Δ179–180 (Δ6)) totally failed to generate BK currents and cell surface expression (Fig. 6B). To examine this site-specific regulation further, eight sets of mutants were prepared by substitution of two or three sequential amino acids with alanine in the sequence from 159 to 180 (MTS, VKD, WAG, VMI, SAQ, TLT, GR, and VL in Fig. 6A). The variants of MTS, VKD, WAG, VMI, and VL showed significantly smaller whole-cell BK current. However, these mutants localized to the PM to a similar extent as BKαWT (Fig. 6C). Voltage dependence of these mutants was obtained from the activation curves at pCa 6.5 and compared by the half-activation voltage (V1/2) (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 6E, the activation curves of Δ3, MTS, VKD, WAG, VMI, and VL showed substantial rightward shift in comparison with WT. Accordingly, V1/2 values were elevated (Fig. 6F and supplemental Table S5). For example, VMI showed PM expression comparable to WT but"

Host resistance to this pathogen is partial and is encoded by a large number of quantitative trait loci, each conditioning small effects. Breeding SDS resistance is therefore challenging and identification of single-gene encoded novel resistance mechanisms is becoming a priority to fight this devastating this fungal pathogen. In this transcriptomic study we identified a few putative soybean defense genes, expression of which is suppressed during F. virguliforme infection. The F. virguliforme infection-suppressed genes were broadly classified into four major classes. The steady state transcript levels of many of these genes were suppressed to undetectable levels immediately following F. virguliforme infection. One of these classes contains two novel genes encoding ankyrin repeat-containing proteins. Expression of one of these genes, GmARP1, during F. virguliforme infection enhances SDS resistance among the transgenic soybean plants. Our data suggest that GmARP1 is a novel defense gene and the pathogen presumably suppress its expression to establish compatible interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2533653509,"Recent work with simulated reductions in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity has found decrements in survey spatial learning as well as increased attentional demands when navigating, compared to performance with normal vision. Given these findings, and previous work showing that peripheral field loss has been associated with impaired mobility and spatial memory for room-sized spaces, we investigated the role of peripheral vision during navigation using a large-scale spatial learning paradigm. First, we aimed to establish the magnitude of spatial memory errors at different levels of field restriction. Second, we tested the hypothesis that navigation under these different levels of restriction would use additional attentional resources. Normally sighted participants walked on novel real-world paths wearing goggles that restricted the field-of-view (FOV) to severe (15°, 10°, 4°, or 0°) or mild angles (60°) and then pointed to remembered target locations using a verbal reporting measure. They completed a concurrent auditory reaction time task throughout each path to measure cognitive load. Only the most severe restrictions (4° and blindfolded) showed impairment in pointing error compared to the mild restriction (within-subjects). The 10° and 4° conditions also showed an increase in reaction time on the secondary attention task, suggesting that navigating with these extreme peripheral field restrictions demands the use of limited cognitive resources. This comparison of different levels of field restriction suggests that although peripheral field loss requires the actor to use more attentional resources while navigating starting at a less extreme level (10°), spatial memory is not negatively affected until the restriction is very severe (4°). These results have implications for understanding of the mechanisms underlying spatial learning during navigation and the approaches that may be taken to develop assistance for navigation with visual impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2535749862,"A nodal cytoplasmic actin network underlies actin cytoplasm cohesion in the absence of stress fibers. We previously described such a network that forms upon Latrunculin A (LatA) treatment, in which formin DAAM1 was localized at these nodes. Knock down of DAAM1 reduced the mobility of actin nodes but the nodes remained. Here we have investigated DAAM1 containing nodes after LatA washout. DAAM1 was found to be distributed between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. The membrane binding likely occurs through an interaction with lipid rafts, but is not required for F-actin assembly. Interesting the forced interaction of DAAM1 with plasma membrane through a rapamycin-dependent linkage, enhanced F-actin assembly at the cell membrane (compared to the cytoplasm) after the LatA washout. However, immediately after addition of both rapamycin and LatA, the cytoplasmic actin nodes formed transiently, before DAAM1 moved to the membrane. This was consistent with the idea that DAAM1 was initially anchored to cytoplasmic actin nodes. Further, photoactivatable tracking of DAAM1 showed DAAM1 was immobilized at these actin nodes. Thus, we suggest that DAAM1 organizes actin filaments into a nodal complex, and such nodal complexes seed actin network recovery after actin depolymerization."

The function of cyt bc1 is to couple the reaction of electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c to proton pumping across the membrane. Mechanistically, the electron transfer reaction requires docking of its Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP) subunit to the quinol oxidation site (QP) of the complex. Formation of an H-bond between the ISP and the bound substrate was proposed to mediate the docking. Here we show that the binding of oxazolidinedione-type inhibitors famoxadone, jg144, and fenamidone induces docking of the ISP to the QP site in the absence of the H-bond formation both in mitochondrial and bacterial cyt bc1 complexes, demonstrating that ISP docking is independent of the proposed direct ISP-inhibitor interaction. The binding of oxazolidinedione-type inhibitors to cyt bc1 of different species reveals a toxophore that appears to interact optimally with residues in the QP site. The effect of modifications or additions to the toxophore on the binding to cyt bc1 from different species could not be predicted from structure-based sequence alignments, as demonstrated by the altered binding mode of famoxadone to bacterial cyt bc1.

https://openalex.org/W2536971402,"Nucleic acid amplification tests that are coupled with a digital readout enable the absolute quantification of single molecules, even at ultralow concentrations. Digital methods are robust, versatile and compatible with many amplification chemistries including isothermal amplification, making them particularly invaluable to assays that require sensitive detection, such as the quantification of viral load in occult infections or detection of sparse amounts of DNA from forensic samples. A number of microfluidic platforms are being developed for carrying out digital amplification. However, the mechanistic investigation and optimization of digital assays has been limited by the lack of real-time kinetic information about which factors affect the digital efficiency and analytical sensitivity of a reaction. Commercially available instruments that are capable of tracking digital reactions in real-time are restricted to only a small number of device types and sample-preparation strategies. Thus, most researchers who wish to develop, study, or optimize digital assays rely on the rate of the amplification reaction when performed in a bulk experiment, which is now recognized as an unreliable predictor of digital efficiency. To expand our ability to study how digital reactions proceed in real-time and enable us to optimize both the digital efficiency and analytical sensitivity of digital assays, we built a custom large-format digital real-time amplification instrument that can accommodate a wide variety of devices, amplification chemistries and sample-handling conditions. Herein, we validate this instrument, we provide detailed schematics that will enable others to build their own custom instruments, and we include a complete custom software suite to collect and analyze the data retrieved from the instrument. We believe assay optimizations enabled by this instrument will improve the current limits of nucleic acid detection and quantification, improving our fundamental understanding of single-molecule reactions and providing advancements in practical applications such as medical diagnostics, forensics and environmental sampling."
https://openalex.org/W2537944038,"The role of nuclear receptor PXR in detoxification and clearance of xenobiotics and endobiotics is well-established. However, its projected role in hepatic cancer is rather illusive where its expression is reported altered in different cancers depending on the tissue-type and microenvironment. The expression of PXR, its target genes and their biological or clinical significance have not been examined in hepatic cancer. In the present study, by generating DEN-induced hepatic cancer in mice, we report that the expression of PXR and its target genes CYP3A11 and GSTa2 are down-regulated implying impairment of hepatic detoxification capacity. A higher state of inflammation was observed in liver cancer tissues as evident from upregulation of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α along with NF-κB and STAT3. Our data in mouse model suggested a negative correlation between down-regulation of PXR and its target genes with that of higher expression of inflammatory proteins (like IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB). In conjunction, our findings with relevant cell culture based assays showed that higher expression of PXR is involved in reduction of tumorigenic potential in hepatic cancer. Overall, the findings suggest that inflammation influences the expression of hepatic proteins important in drug metabolism while higher PXR level reduces tumorigenic potential in hepatic cancer."

The World Health Organization recommends that routine Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening in ART-naïve adults with a CD4+ count <100 cells/μL followed by pre-emptive antifungal therapy for CrAg-positive patients be considered where CrAg prevalence is ≥3%. The prevalence of CrAg among HIV adults in Namibia is unknown. We estimated CrAg prevalence among HIV-infected adults receiving care in Namibia for the purpose of informing routine screening strategies.The study design was cross-sectional. De-identified plasma specimens collected for routine CD4+ testing from HIV-infected adults enrolled in HIV care at 181 public health facilities from November 2013 to January 2014 were identified at the national reference laboratory. Remnant plasma from specimens with CD4+ counts <200 cells/μL were sampled and tested for CrAg using the IMMY® Lateral Flow Assay. CrAg prevalence was estimated and assessed for associations with age, sex, and CD4+ count.A total of 825 specimens were tested for CrAg. The median (IQR) age of patients from whom specimens were collected was 38 (32-46) years, 45.9% were female and 62.9% of the specimens had CD4 <100 cells/μL. CrAg prevalence was 3.3% overall and 3.9% and 2.3% among samples with CD4+ counts of CD4+<100 cells/μL and 100-200 cells/μL, respectively. CrAg positivity was significantly higher among patients with CD4+ cells/μL < 50 (7.2%, P = 0.001) relative to those with CD4 cells/μL 50-200 (2.2%).This is the first study to estimate CrAg prevalence among HIV-infected patients in Namibia. CrAg prevalence of ≥3.0% among patients with CD4+<100 cells/μL justifies routine CrAg screening and preemptive treatment among HIV-infected in Namibia in line with WHO recommendations. Patients with CD4+<100 cells/μL have a significantly greater risk for CrAg positivity. Revised guidelines for ART in Namibia now recommend routine screening for CrAg."
https://openalex.org/W2529716072,"Glycosylation of flagellins is a well recognized property of many bacterial species. In this study, we describe the structural characterization of novel flagellar glycans from a number of hypervirulent strains of C. difficile. We used mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS and MS/MS analysis) to identify a number of putative glycopeptides that carried a variety of glycoform substitutions, each of which was linked through an initial N-acetylhexosamine residue to Ser or Thr. Detailed analysis of a LLDGSSTEIR glycopeptide released by tryptic digestion, which carried two variant structures, revealed that the glycopeptide contained, in addition to carbohydrate moieties, a novel structural entity. A variety of electrospray-MS strategies using Q-TOF technology were used to define this entity, including positive and negative ion collisionally activated decomposition MS/MS, which produced unique fragmentation patterns, and high resolution accurate mass measurement to allow derivation of atomic compositions, leading to the suggestion of a taurine-containing peptidylamido-glycan structure. Finally, NMR analysis of flagellin glycopeptides provided complementary information. The glycan portion of the modification was assigned as α-Fuc3N-(1→3)-α-Rha-(1→2)-α-Rha3OMe-(1→3)-β-GlcNAc-(1→)Ser, and the novel capping moiety was shown to be comprised of taurine, alanine, and glycine. This is the first report of a novel O-linked sulfonated peptidylamido-glycan moiety decorating a flagellin protein."

An even distribution of primary sampling units were selected based on their proximity to centroids on a hexagonal grid laid over the survey area. A sample of n = 18 households from each of m = 252 primary sampling units PSUs was taken. Demographic data on all members of these households were collected, and a broader dataset was collected about a single caregiver and a child in the first 2 years of life. Data were collected on demographic and socioeconomic status; education; housing conditions; recent infant and child mortality; water, sanitation, and hygiene practices; food security; child health; infant and young child feeding practices; maternal dietary diversity; coverage of fortified staples; and maternal and child anthropometry. Data were collected from 4,627 households and the same number of caregiver/child pairs. Atta wheat flour was widely consumed across the state (83%); however, only about 7% of the atta wheat flour was classified as fortifiable, and only about 6% was actually fortified (mostly inadequately). For oil, almost 90% of edible oil consumed by households in the survey was classified as fortifiable, but only about 24% was fortified. For salt, coverage was high, with almost 85% of households using fortified salt and 66% of households using adequately fortified salt. Iodized salt coverage was also high; however, rural and poor population groups were less likely to be reached by the intervention. Voluntary fortification of atta wheat flour and edible oil lacked sufficient industry consolidation to cover significant portions of the population. It is crucial that appropriate delivery channels are utilized to effectively deliver essential micronutrients to at-risk population groups. Government distribution systems are likely the best means to accomplish this goal."
https://openalex.org/W2551904109,"The mechanism of LDL receptor (LDLR) degradation mediated by the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has been extensively studied; however, many steps within this process remain unclear and still require characterization. Recent studies have shown that PCSK9 lacking its Cys/His-rich domain can still promote LDLR internalization, but the complex does not reach the lysosome suggesting the presence of an additional interaction partner(s). In this study we carried out an unbiased screening approach to identify PCSK9-interacting proteins in the HepG2 cells' secretome using co-immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry analyses. Several interacting proteins were identified, including glypican-3 (GPC3), phospholipid transfer protein, matrilin-3, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, fibrinogen-like 1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. We then validated these interactions by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Furthermore, functional validation was examined by silencing each candidate protein in HepG2 cells using short hairpin RNAs to determine their effect on LDL uptake and LDLR levels. Only GPC3 and phospholipid transfer protein silencing in HepG2 cells significantly increased LDL uptake in these cells and displayed higher total LDLR protein levels compared with control cells. Moreover, our study provides the first evidence that GPC3 can modulate the PCSK9 extracellular activity as a competitive binding partner to the LDLR in HepG2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2536495957,"Both tyrosine kinase and topoisomerase II (TopII) are important anticancer targets, and their respective inhibitors are widely used in cancer therapy. However, some combinations of anticancer drugs could exhibit mutually antagonistic actions and drug resistance, which further limit their therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report that HMNE3, a novel bis-fluoroquinolone chalcone-like derivative that targets both tyrosine kinase and TopII, induces tumor cell proliferation and growth inhibition. The viabilities of 6 different cancer cell lines treated with a range of HMNE3 doses were detected using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cellular apoptosis was determined using Hoechst 33258 fluorescence staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The expression of activated Caspase-3 was examined by immunocytochemistry. The tyrosine kinase activity was measured with a human receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) detection kit using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated phosphotyrosine (pY20) antibody as the substrate. The topoisomerase II activity was measured using agarose gel electrophoresis with the DNA plasmid pBR322 as the substrate. The expression levels of the P53, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, -8, -9, p-cSrc, c-Src and topoisomerase II proteins were detected by western blot analysis. The proliferation of five of the six cancer cell lines was significantly inhibited by HMNE3 at 0.312 to 10 μmol/L in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Treatment of the Capan-1 and Panc-1 cells with 1.6 to 3.2 μM HMNE3 for 48 h significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells (P<0.05), and this effect was accompanied by a decrease in tyrosine kinase activity. HMNE3 potentially inhibited tyrosine kinase activity in vitro with an IC50 value of 0.64±0.34 μmol/L in Capan-1 cells and 3.1±0.86 μmol/L in Panc-1 cells. The activity of c-Src was significantly inhibited by HMNE3 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in different cellular contexts. Compared with the control group, HMNE3 induced increased expression of cellular apoptosis-related proteins. Consistent with cellular apoptosis data, a significant decrease in topoisomerase IIβ activity was noted following treatment with HMNE3 for 24 h. Our data suggest that HMNE3 induced apoptosis in Capan-1 and Panc-1 cells by inhibiting the activity of both tyrosine kinases and topoisomerase II."
https://openalex.org/W2534364985,"In tundra ecosystems, bryophytes influence soil processes directly and indirectly through interactions with overstory shrub species. We experimentally manipulated moss cover and measured seasonal soil properties and processes under two species of deciduous shrubs with contrasting canopy structures, Salix planifolia pulchra and Betula glandulosa-nana complex. Soil properties (seasonal temperature, moisture and C:N ratios) and processes (seasonal litter decomposition and soil respiration) were measured over twelve months. Shrub species identity had the largest influence on summer soil temperatures and soil respiration rates, which were higher under Salix canopies. Mosses were associated with lower soil moisture irrespective of shrub identity, but modulated the effects of shrubs on winter soil temperatures and soil C:N ratios so that moss cover reduced differences in soil winter temperatures between shrub species and reduced C:N ratios under Betula but not under Salix canopies. Our results suggest a central role of mosses in mediating soil properties and processes, with their influence depending on shrub species identity. Such species-dependent effects need to be accounted for when forecasting vegetation dynamics under ongoing environmental changes."

EFV may have appreciable side effects (SE), and ART adherence in pregnancy is a major concern, but little is known about ART SE and associations with adherence in pregnancy.We investigated the distribution of patient-reported SE (based on Division of AIDS categories) and the association of SE with missed ART doses in a cohort of 517 women starting EFV+3TC/FTC+TDF during pregnancy. In analysis, SE were considered in terms of their overall frequency, by systems category, and by latent classes.Overall 97% of women reported experiencing at least one SE after ART initiation, with 48% experiencing more than five SE. Gastrointestinal, central nervous system, systemic and skin SE were reported by 81%, 85%, 79% and 31% of women, respectively, with considerable overlap across groups. At least one missed dose was reported by 32% of women. In multivariable models, ART non-adherence was associated with systemic SE compared to other systems categories, and measures of the overall burden of SE experienced were most strongly associated with missed ART doses.These data demonstrate very high levels of SE in pregnant women initiating EFV-based ART and a strong association between SE burden and ART adherence. ART regimens with reduced SE profiles may enhance adherence, and as countries expand universal ART for all adult patients, counseling must include preparation for ART SE."
https://openalex.org/W2536822750,"The regulation of gene expression in trypanosomatids occurs mainly at the post-transcriptional level. Despite the importance of this type of control in Trypanosoma cruzi, few RNA binding proteins have been characterized. The RRM domain (RNA Recognition Motif) is one of the most abundant domains found in RNA-binding proteins in higher eukaryotes. Proteins containing the RRM domain are involved in the majority of post-transcriptional processes regulating gene expression. In this work, we aimed to characterize the protein TcNRBD1 from T. cruzi. TcNRBD1 is an RNA-binding protein that contains 2 RRM domains and is the ortholog of the P34 and P37 proteins from Trypanosoma brucei. The TcNRBD1 protein is expressed in all developmental stages of T. cruzi, and its localization pattern is concentrated at the perinuclear region. TcNRBD1 is associated with polysomes and with the 80S monosomes. Furthermore, sequencing of the mRNAs bound to TcNRBD1 allowed the identification of several transcripts that encode ribosomal proteins. Immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry showed that the protein complexes with several ribosomal proteins from both the 40S and 60S subunits. In summary, the results indicate that TcNRBD1 is associated with different parts of the translation process, either by regulating mRNAs that encode ribosomal proteins or by acting in some step of ribosome assembly in T. cruzi."
https://openalex.org/W2534637284,"Although pitch is a fundamental attribute of auditory perception, substantial individual differences exist in our ability to perceive differences in pitch. Little is known about how these individual differences in the auditory modality might affect crossmodal processes such as audiovisual perception. In this study, we asked whether individual differences in pitch perception might affect audiovisual perception, as it relates to age of onset and number of years of musical training. Fifty-seven subjects made subjective ratings of interval size when given point-light displays of audio, visual, and audiovisual stimuli of sung intervals. Audiovisual stimuli were divided into congruent and incongruent (audiovisual-mismatched) stimuli. Participants’ ratings correlated strongly with interval size in audio-only, visual-only, and audiovisual-congruent conditions. In the audiovisual-incongruent condition, ratings correlated more with audio than with visual stimuli, particularly for subjects who had better pitch perception abilities and higher nonverbal IQ scores. To further investigate the effects of age of onset and length of musical training, subjects were divided into musically trained and untrained groups. Results showed that among subjects with musical training, the degree to which participants’ ratings correlated with auditory interval size during incongruent audiovisual perception was correlated with both nonverbal IQ and age of onset of musical training. After partialing out nonverbal IQ, pitch discrimination thresholds were no longer associated with incongruent audio scores, whereas age of onset of musical training remained associated with incongruent audio scores. These findings invite future research on the developmental effects of musical training, particularly those relating to the process of audiovisual perception."

https://openalex.org/W2535409000,"The structure of contacts that mediate transmission has a pronounced effect on the outbreak dynamics of infectious disease and simulation models are powerful tools to inform policy decisions. Most simulation models of livestock disease spread rely to some degree on predictions of animal movement between holdings. Typically, movements are more common between nearby farms than between those located far away from each other. Here, we assessed spatiotemporal variation in such distance dependence of animal movement contacts from an epidemiological perspective. We evaluated and compared nine statistical models, applied to Swedish movement data from 2008. The models differed in at what level (if at all), they accounted for regional and/or seasonal heterogeneities in the distance dependence of the contacts. Using a kernel approach to describe how probability of contacts between farms changes with distance, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian framework and estimated parameters by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. We evaluated models by three different approaches of model selection. First, we used Deviance Information Criterion to evaluate their performance relative to each other. Secondly, we estimated the log predictive posterior distribution, this was also used to evaluate their relative performance. Thirdly, we performed posterior predictive checks by simulating movements with each of the parameterized models and evaluated their ability to recapture relevant summary statistics. Independent of selection criteria, we found that accounting for regional heterogeneity improved model accuracy. We also found that accounting for seasonal heterogeneity was beneficial, in terms of model accuracy, according to two of three methods used for model selection. Our results have important implications for livestock disease spread models where movement is an important risk factor for between farm transmission. We argue that modelers should refrain from using methods to simulate animal movements that assume the same pattern across all regions and seasons without explicitly testing for spatiotemporal variation."
https://openalex.org/W2532354145,"The African penguin, Spheniscus demersus, is listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to the drastic reduction in population numbers over the last 20 years. To date, the only studies on immunogenetic variation in penguins have been conducted on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. It was shown in humans that up to half of the genetic variability in immune responses to pathogens are located in non-MHC genes. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are now increasingly being studied in a variety of taxa as a broader approach to determine functional genetic diversity. In this study, we confirm low genetic diversity in the innate immune region of African penguins similar to that observed in New Zealand robin that has undergone several severe population bottlenecks. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity across TLRs varied between ex situ and in situ penguins with the number of non-synonymous alterations in ex situ populations (n = 14) being reduced in comparison to in situ populations (n = 16). Maintaining adaptive diversity is of vital importance in the assurance populations as these animals may potentially be used in the future for re-introductions. Therefore, this study provides essential data on immune gene diversity in penguins and will assist in providing an additional monitoring tool for African penguin in the wild, as well as to monitor diversity in ex situ populations and to ensure that diversity found in the in situ populations are captured in the assurance populations."
https://openalex.org/W2538517239,"Purpose This paper presents and studies a framework for reliable modeling of diffusion MRI using a data-acquisition adaptive prior. Methods Automated relevance determination estimates the mean of the posterior distribution of a rank-2 dual tensor model exploiting Jeffreys prior (JARD). This data-acquisition prior is based on the Fisher information matrix and enables the assessment whether two tensors are mandatory to describe the data. The method is compared to Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of the dual tensor model and to FSL’s ball-and-stick approach. Results Monte Carlo experiments demonstrated that JARD’s volume fractions correlated well with the ground truth for single and crossing fiber configurations. In single fiber configurations JARD automatically reduced the volume fraction of one compartment to (almost) zero. The variance in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the main tensor component was thereby reduced compared to MLE. JARD and MLE gave a comparable outcome in data simulating crossing fibers. On brain data, JARD yielded a smaller spread in FA along the corpus callosum compared to MLE. Tract-based spatial statistics demonstrated a higher sensitivity in detecting age-related white matter atrophy using JARD compared to both MLE and the ball-and-stick approach. Conclusions The proposed framework offers accurate and precise estimation of diffusion properties in single and dual fiber regions."
https://openalex.org/W2538631497,"The transcriptomes of cells infected with lytic and non-lytic variants of coxsackievirus B2 Ohio-1 (CVB2O) were analyzed using next generation sequencing. This approach was selected with the purpose of elucidating the effects of lytic and non-lytic viruses on host cell transcription. Total RNA was extracted from infected cells and sequenced. The resulting reads were subsequently mapped against the human and CVB2O genomes. The amount of intracellular RNA was measured, indicating lower proportions of human RNA in the cells infected with the lytic virus compared to the non-lytic virus after 48 hours. This may be explained by reduced activity of the cellular transcription/translation machinery in lytic enteroviral replication due to activities of the enteroviral proteases 2A and/or 3C. Furthermore, differential expression in the cells infected with the two virus variants was identified and a number of transcripts were singled out as possible answers to the question of how the viruses interact with the host cells, resulting in lytic or non-lytic infections."

The pearls were investigated in detail using a variety of methods. Micro-CT scanning of the fossil pearls was carried out to discover the inner structure and the pearl nucleus. Using CTAn software, changes in the gray levels of the biggest pearl, which reflect the changing density of the material, were investigated. The results provide us with some clues on how these pearls were formed. Sand grains, shell debris or material with a similar density could have stimulated the development of these pearls. X-ray diffraction analysis of one fossil pearl and the shell to which it was attached reveals that only aragonite exists in both samples. The internal structures of our fossil shells and pearls were investigated using a Scanning Electron Microscope. These investigations throw some light on pearl development in the past."

Furthermore, we provide a reliability test statistic of the complex system and extract the limit distribution of the test statistic. Therefore, we can obtain the confidence interval for reliability and make statistical inferences. The simulation studies also demonstrate the theorem results."
https://openalex.org/W2532242807,"To determine the taxonomic identities and the systematic positions of some collections of Lindsaea sect. Synaphlebium (Lindsaeaceae) from Papua New Guinea, we conducted morphological comparisons and phylogenetic analyses on the whole section. A total of 22 morphological characters were selected and coded for each of all known taxa in L. sect. Synaphlebium, and were analyzed using maximum parsimony. The datasets containing either of or combined two plastid DNA sequences (trnL-trnF spacer and trnH-psbA spacer) of 37 taxa were analyzed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. Morphological comparisons revealed two new species which are formally published here as L. subobscura and L. novoguineensis. Lindsaea subobscura is similar to sympatric L. obscura and L. modesta but differs in the obviously reduced upper pinnules and other characters. Lindsaea novoguineensis is most similar to L. pacifica from Melanesia but differs in having rhomboid pinnules with truncate apices and concave soral receptacles. Molecular analyses resolved L. sect. Synaphlebium and allied species into five well-supported clades, namely L. rigida clade, L. obtusa clade, L. pulchella clade, L. multisora clade, and L. cultrata clade. The new species L. novoguineensis is included in L. obtusa clade; L. subobscura is in L. pulchella clade; whereas the majority of L. sect. Synaphlebium is clustered in L. cultrata clade. As the section Synaphlebium sensu Kramer is strongly suggested as polyphyletic, we propose the concept of a monophyletic L. sect. Synaphlebium in a broad sense that comprises five lineages. The morphological circumscription of L. sect. Synaphlebium sensu lato and the divergence in morphology, habit, and distribution between the five lineages are briefly discussed. Further molecular study is needed to test the systematic positions of 16 other species which are supposed to be within L. sect. Synaphlebium sensu lato but have not been included in this and previous molecular analyses."
