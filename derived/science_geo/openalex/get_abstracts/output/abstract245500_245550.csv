Resilient social-ecological systems incorporate diverse mechanisms for living with, and learning from, change and unexpected shocks. Disaster management requires multilevel governance systems that can enhance the capacity to cope with uncertainty and surprise by mobilizing diverse sources of resilience."
https://openalex.org/W2085197940,"Coordination between cell proliferation and cell death is essential to maintain homeostasis in multicellular organisms. In Drosophila, these two processes are regulated by a pathway involving the Ste20-like kinase Hippo (Hpo) and the NDR family kinase Warts (Wts; also called Lats). Hpo phosphorylates and activates Wts, which in turn, through unknown mechanisms, negatively regulates the transcription of cell-cycle and cell-death regulators such as cycE and diap1. Here we identify Yorkie (Yki), the Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP), as a missing link between Wts and transcriptional regulation. Yki is required for normal tissue growth and diap1 transcription and is phosphorylated and inactivated by Wts. Overexpression of yki phenocopies loss-of-function mutations of hpo or wts, including elevated transcription of cycE and diap1, increased proliferation, defective apoptosis, and tissue overgrowth. Thus, Yki is a critical target of the Wts/Lats protein kinase and a potential oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2079790280,"FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) is a conserved promoter of flowering that acts downstream of various regulatory pathways, including one that mediates photoperiodic induction through CONSTANS ( CO ), and is expressed in the vasculature of cotyledons and leaves. A bZIP transcription factor, FD, preferentially expressed in the shoot apex is required for FT to promote flowering. FD and FT are interdependent partners through protein interaction and act at the shoot apex to promote floral transition and to initiate floral development through transcriptional activation of a floral meristem identity gene, APETALA1 ( AP1 ). FT may represent a long-distance signal in flowering."
https://openalex.org/W1986236305,"Flowering of Arabidopsis is regulated by several environmental and endogenous signals. An important integrator of these inputs is the FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) gene, which encodes a small, possibly mobile protein. A primary response to floral induction is the activation of FT RNA expression in leaves. Because flowers form at a distant site, the shoot apex, these data suggest that FT primarily controls the timing of flowering. Integration of temporal and spatial information is mediated in part by the bZIP transcription factor FD, which is already expressed at the shoot apex before floral induction. A complex of FT and FD proteins in turn can activate floral identity genes such as APETALA1 ( AP1 )."
https://openalex.org/W2123784922,"Transposable elements have been routinely used for genetic manipulation in lower organisms, including generating transgenic animals and insertional mutagenesis. In contrast, the usage of transposons in mice and other vertebrate systems is still limited due to the lack of an efficient transposition system. We have tested the ability of piggyBac (PB), a DNA transposon from the cabbage looper moth Trichoplusia ni, to transpose in mammalian systems. We show that PB elements carrying multiple genes can efficiently transpose in human and mouse cell lines and also in mice. PB permits the expression of the marker genes it carried. During germline transposition, PB could excise precisely from original insertion sites and transpose into the mouse genome at diverse locations, preferably transcription units. These data provide a first and critical step toward a highly efficient transposon system for a variety of genetic manipulations including transgenesis and insertional mutagenesis in mice and other vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1972011626,"SR proteins constitute a family of pre-mRNA splicing factors now thought to play several roles in mRNA metabolism in metazoan cells. Here we provide evidence that a prototypical SR protein, ASF/SF2, is unexpectedly required for maintenance of genomic stability. We first show that in vivo depletion of ASF/SF2 results in a hypermutation phenotype likely due to DNA rearrangements, reflected in the rapid appearance of DNA double-strand breaks and high-molecular-weight DNA fragments. Analysis of DNA from ASF/SF2-depleted cells revealed that the nontemplate strand of a transcribed gene was single stranded due to formation of an RNA:DNA hybrid, R loop structure. Stable overexpression of RNase H suppressed the DNA-fragmentation and hypermutation phenotypes. Indicative of a direct role, ASF/SF2 prevented R loop formation in a reconstituted in vitro transcription reaction. Our results support a model by which recruitment of ASF/SF2 to nascent transcripts by RNA polymerase II prevents formation of mutagenic R loop structures."
https://openalex.org/W2119488140,"Platelets are specialized hemostatic cells that circulate in the blood as anucleate cytoplasts. We report that platelets unexpectedly possess a functional spliceosome, a complex that processes pre-mRNAs in the nuclei of other cell types. Spliceosome components are present in the cytoplasm of human megakaryocytes and in proplatelets that extend from megakaryocytes. Primary human platelets also contain essential spliceosome factors including small nuclear RNAs, splicing proteins, and endogenous pre-mRNAs. In response to integrin engagement and surface receptor activation, platelets precisely excise introns from interleukin-1beta pre-mRNA, yielding a mature message that is translated into protein. Signal-dependent splicing is a novel function of platelets that demonstrates remarkable specialization in the regulatory repertoire of this anucleate cell. While this mechanism may be unique to platelets, it also suggests previously unrecognized diversity regarding the functional roles of the spliceosome in eukaryotic cells."

PhoQ and its cognate response regulator PhoP constitute a signal-transduction cascade that controls inducible resistance to host antimicrobial peptides. We show that enzymatic activity of Salmonella typhimurium PhoQ is directly activated by antimicrobial peptides. A highly acidic surface of the PhoQ sensor domain participates in both divalent-cation and antimicrobial-peptide binding as a first step in signal transduction across the bacterial membrane. Identification of PhoQ signaling mutants, binding studies with the PhoQ sensor domain, and structural analysis of this domain can be incorporated into a model in which antimicrobial peptides displace divalent cations from PhoQ metal binding sites to initiate signal transduction.

Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which bacteria sense small innate immune molecules to initiate a transcriptional program that promotes bacterial virulence. Multicellular organisms restrict the growth of invading bacteria by both innate and adaptive immunity. One important component of innate immunity is cationic antimicrobial peptides, which are evolutionarily conserved and found in diverse organisms, including amoebas, fruit flies, plants, and mammals (Ganz, 2003Ganz T. Defensins: antimicrobial peptides of innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar, Hancock and Diamond, 2000Hancock R.E. Diamond G. The role of cationic antimicrobial peptides in innate host defences.Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides have tremendous sequence diversity, but many share common structural features, including a net positive charge and an amphipathic structure, which promotes their ability to interact with negatively charged biological membranes (Dathe and Wieprecht, 1999Dathe M. Wieprecht T. Structural features of helical antimicrobial peptides: their potential to modulate activity on model membranes and biological cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 71-87Crossref Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The role of antimicrobial peptides in host resistance to microbial pathogens is now well established. For example, they make up the majority of effectors of the Drosophila melanogaster immune system (Hoffmann, 2003Hoffmann J.A. The immune response of Drosophila.Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), while, in mammals, the peptide CRAMP controls the lesion size resulting from group A Streptococcus skin infections (Nizet et al., 2001Nizet V. Ohtake T. Lauth X. Trowbridge J. Rudisill J. Dorschner R.A. Pestonjamasp V. Piraino J. Huttner K. Gallo R.L. Innate antimicrobial peptide protects the skin from invasive bacterial infection.Nature. 2001; 414: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), and increased expression of human defensin HD-5 in transgenic mice can alter the host-pathogen relationship (Salzman et al., 2003Salzman N.H.

Protection against enteric salmonellosis in transgenic mice expressing a human intestinal defensin.Nature. 2003; 422: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Bacteria have developed mechanisms to resist killing by antimicrobial peptides. These mechanisms have been best characterized for Salmonella typhimurium but are also present in other bacterial pathogens (Miller et al., 2005Miller S.I. Ernst R.K. Bader M.W.

How do bacteria resist human antimicrobial peptides?.Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Resistance to antimicrobial peptides is typically acquired by modifications of the bacterial cell surface, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is anchored in the Gram-negative membrane via its lipid A portion, which becomes heavily modified in antimicrobial-peptide-resistant strains (Miller et al., 2005Miller S.I. Ernst R.K. Bader M.W. LPS, TLR4 and infectious disease diversity.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Lipid A modifications are induced during Salmonella invasion of macrophages (Gibbons et al., 2005Gibbons H.S. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.

The PhoPQ system constitutes a signal-transduction cascade composed of the membrane bound sensor kinase PhoQ and the cytosolic response regulator PhoP. Activation of the PhoQ kinase leads to autophosphorylation of PhoQ and subsequent phosphorylation of PhoP, which promotes the transcription of a large number of genes, including those that promote antimicrobial-peptide resistance. PhoPQ is essential for Salmonella virulence in mice and humans (Fields et al., 1989Fields P.I. Groisman E.A. Heffron F.

The Salmonella PhoP/PhoQ system is activated in vivo within acidified macrophage phagosomes (Alpuche Aranda et al., 1992Alpuche Aranda C.M. Swanson J.A. Loomis W.P. Miller S.I. Salmonella typhimurium activates virulence gene transcription within acidified macrophage phagosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). It is repressed in vitro during bacterial growth in high concentrations of the divalent cations Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+ (Garcia Vescovi et al., 1996Garcia Vescovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Mg2+ as an extracellular signal: environmental regulation of Salmonella virulence.Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Repression by these metals is dependent on the PhoQ periplasmic sensor domain, which must transduce signals across the membrane to activate PhoQ phosphatase activity (Castelli et al., 2000Castelli M.E. Garcia Vescovi E. Soncini F.C. The phosphatase activity is the target for Mg2+ regulation of the sensor protein PhoQ in Salmonella.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22948-22954Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Montagne et al., 2001Montagne M. Martel A. Le Moual H. Characterization of the catalytic activities of the PhoQ histidine protein kinase of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1787-1791Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The PhoPQ system is active at low cation concentrations in vitro and fully induced during bacterial replication in macrophages. It has therefore been proposed that low-cation conditions exist within the bacterial phagosome and function as a signal for PhoQ activation. Since divalent-cation-mediated repression may only be one part of the PhoQ sensing mechanism, we recently began a search for other signals that activate PhoQ. Since PhoPQ is essential to protect bacteria from antimicrobial peptides, we reasoned that such peptides could serve as signals for PhoQ activation (Bader et al., 2003Bader M.W. Navarre W.W. Shiau W. Nikaido H. Frye J.G. McClelland M. Fang F.C. Miller S.I. Regulation of Salmonella typhimurium virulence gene expression by cationic antimicrobial peptides.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 219-230Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Previous work demonstrated that the PhoPQ system responds to sublethal concentrations of antimicrobial peptides to promote resistance to peptide-mediated killing. However, as antimicrobial peptides permeabilize membranes, it was unclear whether the mechanism of PhoPQ activation involved an indirect effect of membrane damage or a direct effect of peptide binding to PhoQ. The studies reported here were initiated to dissect the molecular mechanism governing the response of PhoPQ to antimicrobial peptides and to distinguish it from divalent cation-mediated repression. We found that antimicrobial peptides constitute signals that are directly sensed by the PhoQ sensor kinase, resulting in increased phosphotransfer from PhoQ to PhoP. This study provides evidence that antimicrobial peptides and divalent cations compete for binding to a highly acidic region of PhoQ, suggesting that antimicrobial peptides initiate activation of PhoQ by displacing bound divalent cations. Our results reveal a novel example of a sensor kinase from an animal pathogen that is activated by innate immune effectors. Antimicrobial-peptide activation of PhoPQ-regulated gene expression was previously demonstrated in growth medium that was undefined for divalent cations. As medium containing high concentrations of divalent cations represses PhoQ-mediated expression, the activation of PhoQ was compared in medium containing both antimicrobial peptides and Mg2+. A strain expressing a PhoQ-regulated protein fusion to Salmonella acid phosphatase (PhoN) was chosen for analysis. The activity of this fusion protein was measured in growth medium containing the α-helical antimicrobial peptides LL-37 or C18G and varying concentrations of Mg2+. LL-37 and C18G were used because Salmonella likely encounter this class of peptides within macrophages (Rosenberger et al., 2004Rosenberger C.M. Gallo R.L. Finlay B.B. Interplay between antibacterial effectors: a macrophage antimicrobial peptide impairs intracellular Salmonella replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 2422-2427Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Figure 1A shows that sublethal concentrations of antimicrobial peptides significantly induced PhoPQ-dependent gene expression. Stimulation of PhoP activity by LL-37 and C18G occurred at physiologic Mg2+ concentrations (1 mM) but was impaired above 5 mM. This indicates that the effects of LL-37 can be competed by Mg2+ binding either to the bacterial cell surface or to PhoQ directly. Fusion-protein activities in the presence of C18G and LL-37 were comparable to those observed in the same medium containing low concentrations of Mg2+ (10 μM), suggesting that PhoP was fully induced by these peptides. Activation did not occur in a PhoQ null mutant but was restored when PhoQ was introduced on a plasmid, indicating that the PhoQ sensor kinase is required for signaling (Figure 1B). The induction levels in the complemented strain were similar to a strain expressing a constitutive PhoQ variant, further confirming full induction of PhoQ by antimicrobial peptides. The effect of antimicrobial peptides could be an indirect consequence of membrane permeabilization or a direct effect on the PhoQ protein. As illustrated in Figure 2A , PhoQ is comprised of a periplasmic sensor domain, two transmembrane domains, and a cytosolic catalytic domain that undergoes autophosphorylation upon activation. The PhoQ sensor domain consists of 145 amino acids and plays an important role in cation-mediated repression of the PhoPQ system (Garcia Vescovi et al., 1996Garcia Vescovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Mg2+ as an extracellular signal: environmental regulation of Salmonella virulence.Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, Waldburger and Sauer, 1996Waldburger C.D. Sauer R.T. Signal detection by the PhoQ sensor-transmitter. Characterization of the sensor domain and a response-impaired mutant that identifies ligand-binding determinants.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26630-26636Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, a strain containing a deleted phoQ that expresses a mutant PhoQ(Δ51–181) lacking its periplasmic sensor domain was constructed. The resulting strain failed to induce PhoP-dependent gene activation in the presence of C18G (Figure 2B) or other antimicrobial peptides (data not shown), indicating that the PhoQ periplasmic domain is required for the response to antimicrobial peptides. We wished to obtain further genetic evidence for a role of the PhoQ sensor domain during growth in the presence of C18G. It has been reported that the periplasmic domain of Salmonella typhimurium and other enteric bacterial PhoQ is strikingly different on the primary sequence level from the sensing domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PhoQ (Lesley and Waldburger, 2001Lesley J.A. Waldburger C.D. Comparison of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli PhoQ sensor domains: evidence for distinct mechanisms of signal detection.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30827-30833Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Despite this difference, both proteins respond equally to growth in Mg2+-limited medium, suggesting that they share a common signaling mechanism. A strain expressing a chimeric protein consisting of Salmonella typhimurium PhoQ with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensor domain was constructed and tested for response to divalent cations and peptides. This strain responded robustly to limitation of cations, consistent with a previous report for Escherichia coli PhoQ (Figure 2B) (Lesley and Waldburger, 2001Lesley J.A. Waldburger C.D. Comparison of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli PhoQ sensor domains: evidence for distinct mechanisms of signal detection.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30827-30833Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no increase of PhoN fusion activity was observed in the presence of C18G. Taken together, the results provide strong genetic support for an involvement of the Salmonella typhimurium periplasmic domain in antimicrobial-peptide signaling. This indicates that the response is not conserved in PhoQ from the environmental and opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although this bacterium may have other mechanisms to respond to antimicrobial peptides (McPhee et al., 2003McPhee J.B. Lewenza S. Hancock R.E. Cationic antimicrobial peptides activate a two-component regulatory system, PmrA-PmrB, that regulates resistance to polymyxin B and cationic antimicrobial peptides in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 205-217Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Though the periplasmic domain is clearly required for PhoQ-mediated signaling on exposure to antimicrobial peptides, it was plausible that the signal was mediated indirectly as a result of outer-membrane permeability or through another protein. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, full-length PhoQ was purified from membranes and then reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles (Figure 3A ). Using fluorescently labeled thiol-reactive probes directed against the two cysteine residues at positions 392 and 395 of the PhoQ cytoplasmic domain, we determined that PhoQ exhibits an inside-out orientation (>95%), with the periplasmic domain facing the vesicle inside and the histidine-kinase domain exposed to the assay buffer (data not shown). PhoQ activation by antimicrobial peptides was then measured by the subsequent phosphorylation of purified PhoP (Figure 3B). When PhoQ-containing vesicles were preloaded with 1 μg/ml of C18G, both increased autophosphorylation of PhoQ and phosphotransfer to purified PhoP were observed (Figure 3B). PhoQ activation was concentration dependent and increased to nearly 10-fold in the presence of 5 μg/ml C18G (Figure 3C). The concentration of C18G that exhibited the highest level of PhoQ activity is similar to the concentration that gave robust induction in the in vivo experiments (Figure 1A). Thus, our in vivo data are in good agreement with the in vitro reconstituted system. To assess whether PhoQ activity was due to a nonspecific effect of C18G on the conformation or permeability of phospholipid vesicles generated in this system, C18G was added to the assay buffer at 1 μg/ml but omitted from the vesicle lumen. As shown in Figure 3D, no activation of PhoQ was observed under these conditions. This result strongly argues that the periplasmic domain, which is present on the vesicle inside, is involved in peptide signaling and the observed activation is not due to nonspecific effects of C18G, such as membrane permeabilization. To further substantiate this finding, vesicles were preloaded with both C18G (1 μg/ml) and 5 mM MgCl2, which is known to bind to the sensor domain of PhoQ. Figure 3D shows that the extent of PhoQ-catalyzed phosphate transfer from ATP to PhoP decreased significantly in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2. The competition at very high Mg2+ indicates that metal may compete with C18G for binding to the periplasmic domain in the vesicle lumen, further supporting a role for this domain in signaling. To measure the kinetics of PhoQ activation, initial rates of PhoP phosphorylation were measured in the presence of peptides C18G and LL-37. Figure 3E shows that both peptides lead to an increase in the initial rate of PhoQ-dependent phosphorylation of PhoP. The initial rate obtained with α-helical peptide magainin-2 (10 μg/ml) was similar to the one observed for LL-37 (data not shown). Therefore, PhoQ directly responds to the presence of α-helical peptides since no other component is necessary for PhoQ activation in the in vitro system. Our results further indicate that antimicrobial peptides directly activate PhoQ through interactions with its periplasmic sensor domain. The crystal structure of the PhoQ periplasmic sensor domain reveals a negatively charged surface of PhoQ (Figure 4A ), which is predicted to contact the negatively charged membrane through a series of divalent-cation bridges (U.C. and W.X., unpublished data). Divalent cations serve to tether PhoQ to the membrane through ionic bridges between membrane phospholipids and membrane-proximal acidic residues of PhoQ. We sought direct evidence for divalent-cation binding in solution by the PhoQ sensor domain, using Fe2+-catalyzed oxidative cleavage (Figure 4B). Fe2+ ions have been shown to interact with Mg2+ binding sites in many proteins, and this property can be exploited to obtain information about the position of metal binding sites in proteins. When incubated in the cleavage reaction mixture, the PhoQ sensor domain yielded one major cleavage product as visualized by SDS-PAGE (Figure 4B, inset). No cleavage occurred in the presence of 20 mM MgCl2, consistent with Fe2+ binding at one or more PhoQ metal binding sites. The N terminus of the cleavage product was identical with the original construct (i.e., MDKT), and the average mass (determined by MALDI mass spectrometry) was 12,854 Da. Taken together, the results identify the major cleavage product as residues 1–153 with its C-terminal sequence DDDDA153 (predicted mass 12,871 Da) and therefore demonstrate binding of magnesium to the acidic surface of the PhoQ sensor domain. Our data suggest that (1) the periplasmic domain is required for peptide sensing and (2) peptides and divalent cations compete for binding to the periplasmic domain of PhoQ. We utilized three in vitro assays as independent tests for binding of antimicrobial peptides to PhoQ. We determined the extent of iron-mediated cleavage of the PhoQ sensor domain in the presence and absence of C18G peptide. As shown in Figure 4B, hydroxyl radicals generated in the reaction mixture specifically cleave the PhoQ sensor domain. As shown in Figure 5A , when incubated with 10 μg/ml C18G, PhoQ was strongly protected from cleavage, consistent with the proposal that C18G masks Mg2+ binding sites, making them inaccessible for iron-mediated cleavage. To gain further evidence for binding of C18G to PhoQ, a fluorescent derivative of the peptide was synthesized (Figure 5B). The dansylated peptide exhibited low fluorescence yield, with λmax = 525 nm when diluted into assay buffer. When incubated with the purified sensor domain, however, the fluorescence yield increased dramatically, with the maximum fluorescence shifting to a lower wavelength (λmax = 514 nm). Such changes are indicative of a more hydrophobic environment of the dansyl group, which can be best explained by binding of the peptide to PhoQ. The presence of 5 mM MgCl2 significantly inhibited the increase in fluorescence intensity of dansylated C18G due to PhoQ (Figure 5B). C18G binding showed saturation behavior at low micromolar peptide concentrations (Figure 5C), with an apparent Kd = 2.8 μM. Such concentrations are sufficient to activate PhoQ enzymatic activity in vivo and in vitro and compete effectively with 1 mM MgCl2 for PhoQ (Figure 1A). Binding of C18G to PhoQ is specific, as the purified sensor domain of the Klebsiella pneumonia histidine kinase CitA, which is similar to PhoQ in size, net charge, and three-dimensional structure (PAS fold), did not affect the fluorescence spectra over a range of peptide concentrations tested (Figure 5C). Unlabeled C18G effectively outcompeted dansylated C18G, showing that binding was specific and not due to some nonspecific feature of the dansyl group (Figure 5C). Taken together, our results show that antimicrobial peptides compete effectively with metal to interact directly with the sensor domain of PhoQ at a site that overlaps with the metal binding site cleaved by Fe2+ and therefore involves the PhoQ acidic surface. NMR spectra of the periplasmic domain of PhoQ in the presence of antimicrobial peptides could provide an additional highly sensitive assay for the similarity of conformational changes on binding peptides and divalent cations. Unfortunately, when incubated with C18G or LL-37, PhoQ and antimicrobial peptide formed an insoluble precipitate (at the high concentrations required for NMR), impeding analysis. We therefore turned to polymyxin nonapeptide, a derivative of the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B that activates PhoQ-mediated signaling in vivo (3.5-fold in the presence of 20 μg/ml). Polymyxin nonapeptide lacks a fatty acid and is therefore less potent than polymyxin, probably as a result of its decreased hydrophobicity and decreased ability to penetrate the outer membrane. Polymyxin nonapeptide has a net positive charge and amphipathicity characteristic of this class of peptides, and it was suitable for NMR analysis. Spectra of PhoQ in the presence and absence of polymyxin nonapeptide are shown in Figure 5D. Remarkably, many of the peaks that appear in the presence of Mg2+ (green spectrum) also appear when peptide is added (Figure 5D). The peaks that appear in the spectrum of PhoQ in the absence of peptide and divalent cation (black spectrum, Figure 5D) are not perturbed by the addition of the peptide. This indicates that the stable structured core of the PhoQ dimer does not undergo a peptide-induced conformational change. The spectrum of PhoQ in the presence of peptide contains new peaks that are dispersed throughout the spectrum, indicating that peptide binding induces an additional PhoQ stable structure (red spectrum). Remarkably, the peptide-induced peaks are coincident with a subset of the peaks that appear when Mg2+ is added to PhoQ (compare red to green spectra). At the highest peptide concentration used, 10–12 peaks of the ca. 20 that appear with divalent cations are still undetectable or very weak in the PhoQ-peptide spectrum. Addition of 20 mM Mg2+ to a sample containing PhoQ and peptide restored the remaining peaks and produced a spectrum indistinguishable from that obtained for PhoQ plus Mg2+ in the absence of peptide (data not shown). The NMR spectra provide strong evidence that peptide and divalent cations bind at overlapping sites and that the binding events in solution elicit similar conformational effects that stabilize a region of structure that is intrinsically flexible in the absence of a ligand. The acidic surface seems well suited to interact with cationic antimicrobial peptides, which have a net positive charge and a tendency to partition into lipid bilayers. We predicted that amino acid changes in the acidic surface would impair the ability of PhoQ to respond to antimicrobial peptides. Most single mutations in the acidic surface that we constructed exhibited only slight effects on peptide-mediated signaling, probably due to the remaining negative charge (data not shown). However, we were able to identify two amino acid substitutions, E184K and T156K, which lie within the acidic surface and exhibit a defect in C18G-induced activation as measured by the PhoN reporter fusion in vivo (Figure 6). The double T156K/E184K mutant exhibited a further decrease in peptide-mediated signaling, suggesting that these amino acid changes act additively. PhoQ T156K/E184K was also impaired in its response to LL-37"

Nicastrin is an essential glycoprotein component of the γ-secretase complex but has no known function. We now show that the ectodomain of nicastrin binds the new amino terminus that is generated upon proteolysis of the extracellular APP and Notch domains, thereby recruiting the APP and Notch substrates into the γ-secretase complex. Chemical- or antibody-mediated blocking of the free amino terminus, addition of purified nicastrin ectodomain, or mutations in the ectodomain markedly reduce the binding and cleavage of substrate by γ-secretase. These results indicate that nicastrin is a receptor for the amino-terminal stubs that are generated by ectodomain shedding of type I transmembrane proteins. Our data are consistent with a model where nicastrin presents these substrates to γ-secretase and thereby facilitates their cleavage via intramembrane proteolysis."

In the superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ , we identified populations of atomic-scale impurity states whose spatial densities follow closely those of the oxygen dopant atoms. We found that the impurity-state locations are strongly correlated with all manifestations of the nanoscale electronic disorder. This disorder occurs via an unanticipated mechanism exhibiting high-energy spectral weight shifts, with associated strong superconducting coherence peak suppression but very weak scattering of low-energy quasi-particles."
https://openalex.org/W2086257051,"The first event in light perception is absorption of a photon by an opsin pigment, which induces isomerization of its 11-cis-retinaldehyde chromophore. Restoration of light sensitivity to the bleached opsin requires chemical regeneration of 11-cis-retinaldehyde through an enzymatic pathway called the visual cycle. The isomerase, which converts an all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol, has never been identified. Here, we performed an unbiased cDNA expression screen to identify this isomerase. We discovered that the isomerase is a previously characterized protein called Rpe65. We confirmed our identification of the isomerase by demonstrating catalytic activity in mammalian and insect cells that express Rpe65. Mutations in the human RPE65 gene cause a blinding disease of infancy called Leber congenital amaurosis. Rpe65 with the Leber-associated C330Y and Y368H substitutions had no isomerase activity. Identification of Rpe65 as the isomerase explains the phenotypes in rpe65-/- knockout mice and in humans with Leber congenital amaurosis."

Climate change can have adverse impacts on insurance affordability and availability, potentially slowing the growth of the industry and shifting more of the burden to governments and individuals. Most forms of insurance are vulnerable, including property, liability, health, and life. It is incumbent on insurers, their regulators, and the policy community to develop a better grasp of the physical and business risks. Insurers are well positioned to participate in public-private initiatives to monitor loss trends, improve catastrophe modeling, address the causes of climate change, and prepare for and adapt to the impacts."

Such challenges have generated specific policy responses, such as enhanced security at transportation hubs and planned deployment of a global tsunami detection network. However, the range of challenges and the practical impossibility of adequately addressing each in turn argue for adoption of a more comprehensive systems perspective. This should be based on the principle of enhancing social and economic resiliency as well as meeting security and emergency response needs and, to the extent possible, developing and implementing dual-use technologies that offer societal benefits even if anticipated disasters never occur."

Recent studies implicate proteolysis in the activation of a ubiquitous plasma chemoattractant, chemerin, a ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor CMKLR1 present on plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages. To define the pathophysiologic triggers of chemerin activity, we evaluated the ability of serum- and inflammation-associated proteases to cleave chemerin and stimulate CMKLR1-mediated chemotaxis. We showed that serine proteases factor XIIa and plasmin of the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades, elastase and cathepsin G released from activated neutrophil granules and mast cell tryptase are all potent activators of chemerin. Activation results from cleavage of the labile carboxyl terminus of the chemoattractant at any of several different sites. Activation of chemerin by the serine protease cascades that trigger rapid defenses in the body may direct CMKLR1-positive plasmacytoid dendritic cell and tissue macrophage recruitment to sterile sites of tissue damage, as well as trafficking to sites of infectious and allergic inflammation.

A network of serine proteases regulates the primary response to injury and infection in the host. Serine proteases of the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades mediate the homeostatic response to blood vessel injury. Kallikrein and factor XIIa process kininogens to generate bradykinin, a potent vasodilator that triggers increased vascular permeability during inflammation. Serine proteases termed convertases release multiple pathogen-neutralizing components of activated complement. Serine protease cascades also regulate the recruitment of phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells to sites of inflammation and tissue damage. The complement cascade, for example, releases active components C5a and C3a, potent attractants for many leukocytes, including neutrophils and monocytes (1Fernandez H.N. Henson P.M. Otani A.

Thus serine proteases are critical participants in rapid defense mechanisms in the body. We and others have recently identified chemerin as a potent chemoattractant for cells expressing the G-protein-linked receptor chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), 5The abbreviations used are: CMKLR1, chemokine-like receptor 1; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cell; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator. 5The abbreviations used are: CMKLR1, chemokine-like receptor 1; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cell; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator. also known as ChemR23 or DEZ (3Wittamer V.

Zabel, manuscript in preparation. pDCs are major producers of α-interferons and can differentiate into antigen-presenting cells capable of triggering T effector or suppressor responses (7Colonna M. Trinchieri G. Liu Y.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Tissue macrophages have a major role as phagocytes but, similar to pDCs, are also implicated in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses and in regulating immunity in sterile versus infectious tissue injury (8Stoy N. Pathobiology. 2001; 69: 179-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Importantly, chemerin is widely expressed and circulates in human plasma in an inactive state (5Zabel B.A. Silverio A.M. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Active forms of chemerin have been isolated from human ascites fluid, hemofiltrate, and serum and are characterized by apparent proteolytic cleavage of carboxyl-terminal amino acids present in the relatively inactive full-length pro-chemoattractant (3Wittamer V. Franssen J.D. Vulcano M. Mirjolet J.F. Le Poul E. Migeotte I. Brezillon S. Tyldesley R. Blanpain C. Detheux M. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Communi D. J. Exp.

Here we have identified serine proteases as potent triggers of chemerin activation. Serum enzymes can activate recombinant chemerin, and this activity was blocked by selective serine protease inhibition. The clotting-associated serine proteases, factors XIIa and VIIa, and the fibrinolysis-associated serine proteases plasmin and plasminogen activators can all activate chemerin. Inflammatory cell-associated serine proteases, including neutrophil granule elastase and mast cell tryptase, are activators as well. Moreover, we found that several different cleavage sites, present in endogenous serum chemerin or generated during processing with specific enzymes, are sufficient for activation of this potent leukocyte attractant. These findings add chemerin to the list of innate immune mediators whose activity is critically regulated by serine protease cascades and implicate chemerin as an important link between these mechanisms of blood and tissue hemostasis and the recruitment of specialized CMKLR1-expressing “rapid responder” macrophages and dendritic cells. In Vitro Transwell Chemotaxis—CMKLR1/L1.2 transfectants were generated as previously described (5Zabel B.A. Silverio A.M. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). 5-μm pore Transwell inserts (Costar) were used for the migration assays. 100 μl of cells were added to the top well, and test samples were added to the bottom well in a 600-μl volume. The chemotaxis medium consisted of RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum plus additives. Migration was assayed for 2 h at 37 °C, the inserts were removed, and the cells that had migrated through the filter to the lower chamber were counted by flow cytometry. ∼2.5 × 105 cells/well were used as input, and the number of cells counted in 30 s was defined as the migration output. The results are reported as % input migration or % maximal migration. Chemerin Expression and Purification Using Baculovirus—Chemerin with a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag was cloned into pACGP67 (BD Biosciences) and transfected into Sf-9 cells. The expressed protein has the sequence NH2-ADPELTEA... LPRSPHHHHHH-COOH, where the underlined residues are non-native. After viral amplification, chemerin was expressed by adding high titer virus to shaker flasks containing Hi-5 insect cells in Ex-cell 420 media (JRH Biosciences). After incubation for 2–3 days at 27.5 °C, the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation, filtered to 0.22 μm, and concentrated at 4 °C using a tangential flow concentrator (Filtron) with a 3-kDa cutoff filter. After a >100-fold buffer exchange into 50 mm HEPES, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 8.0, chemerin was purified by running the solution over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and C-18 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography columns (Vydac). The protein was lyophilized and checked for purity using electrospray mass spectrometry. Chemerin Expression and Purification from Escherichia coli—Chemerin with a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag (having the sequence NH2-MELTEA...LPRSPHHHHHH-COOH, where the underlined residues are non-native) was expressed in TAP302 cells for 4 h at 37 °C. The cell pellets were spun down and detergent-solubilized by successive rounds of homogenization and spinning in the presence of 0.25% sodium deoxycholate. The insoluble inclusion body pellet was solubilized in a denaturing buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and run over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column using a decrease in pH to elute. The FoldIt screen (Hampton Research) was used to test suitable refolding conditions, and a modified version of buffer 11 was chosen as the best choice (50 mm HEPES, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.44 mm KCl, 2.2 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 550 mm l-arginine, 0.055% polyethylene glycol 8000, 1 mm reduced l-glutathione, 0.1 mm oxidized l-glutathione, pH 8.0). Chemerin was refolded by rapidly diluting into the refolding buffer at a final protein concentration of 0.1–0.2 mg/ml. After stirring for a few hours at 4 °C, the protein was rapidly diluted 20-fold further into column buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 8.0) and filtered. The protein was concentrated and purified using the tangential flow concentrator and chromatography, as described in the previous paragraph for baculovirus expression. Serum—The Institutional Review Board at Stanford University approved all human subject protocols, and informed consent was obtained for all donations. Serum was stripped of heparin-binding proteins (including chemerin) by collecting the “flow-through” after passage over a heparin-Sepharose column. An amount of E. coli-expressed chemerin showing <5% input migration was incubated with an equivalent volume of serum or plasma for 5 min at 37 °C and then tested in a chemotaxis assay with CMKLR1/L1.2 transfectants. Neutrophil-conditioned Media—Neutrophils were prepared from citrated peripheral blood obtained from healthy volunteers by density separation using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences). The high density fraction containing neutrophils and erythrocytes was mixed (1:2 v/v) with 1% solution of polyvinyl alcohol in phosphate-buffered saline (Merck) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Neutrophils were collected from the upper phase and subjected to hypotonic lysis to remove contaminating red blood cells. Polymorphonuclear neutrophil (95% pure) were cultured for 20 h in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Conditioned media were collected, centrifuged, and normalized based on protein concentration, as determined by a BCA assay according to the manufacturer's specifications (Pierce). Conditioned media samples containing 14 μg of total protein were incubated for 5–10 min with recombinant chemerin. Serine Proteases and Inhibitors—Serum was preincubated with 2.5 × 10-5 m aprotinin or 4.6 × 10-3 m E-64 (Sigma) for 1 h before chemerin was added. Neutrophil-conditioned medium was preincubated with 4 × 10-3 m pefabloc SC plus (Roche Applied Science) or 1 × 10-5 m E-64 for 30 min before chemerin was added. Various concentrations of serine proteases were incubated with chemerin for 5–10 min at 37 °C and then tested in chemotaxis. In each case, digestion was arrested by placing the tubes on ice and immediately diluting the samples 1:50 into cold chemotaxis medium for assay. The active forms of the following clotting and complement enzymes were used at concentrations based on their respective physiologic blood zymogen levels, as listed here: 2.7 × 10-6 m thrombin (Sigma), 2.2 × 10-7 m factor Xa (Pierce), 1.0 × 10-8 m factor VIIa, 1.1 × 10-7 m factor IXa, 3.1 × 10-8 m factor XIa, 3.8 × 10-7 m factor XIIa, 4.7 × 10-7 m kallikrein (Enzyme Research Laboratories), 2.6 × 10-6 m plasmin (Sigma) (9Jandl J.H. Blood: Textbook of Hematology, 2nd Ed.. Little, Brown, and Company, Boston1996: 1213-1275Google Scholar), 6.0 × 10-8 m factor D, 3.8 × 10-7 m factor I, 5.7 × 10-7 m C1r, and 6.3 × 10-7 m C1s (Calbiochem) (10Sim R.B. Tsiftsoglou S.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Factor B and C2 were used at concentrations based on their physiologic blood levels of 2.2 × 10-6 m and 2.9 × 10-7 m (Calbiochem), respectively (10Sim R.B. Tsiftsoglou S.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Tissue-type (tPA, Calbiochem) and urokinase-type (uPA, American Diagnostica) plasminogen activators were used at 7.1 × 10-7 m and 1.5 × 10-7 m, respectively. Trypsin isolated from bovine pancreas (Calbiochem) was used at 2.1 × 10-7 m. Mast cell tryptase isolated from human lung (Calbiochem) was used at 5.2 × 10-11 to 5.2 × 10-9 m. Human neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G (Calbiochem) were used at 1 × 10-7 m, and α1-proteinase inhibitor and α1-antichymotrypsin were used at 1 × 10-6 m (BioCentrum). None of the enzymes or inhibitors displayed chemotactic activity when tested in Transwell chemotaxis using CMKLR1/L1.2 transfectants. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF and electrospray mass spectrometry were performed by the Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Biotechnology Facility, the Protein Chemistry Core Facility, University of Columbia, and the Berkeley Protein Core Facility. Tryptic mass values were used in a Mascot search (www.matrixscience.com) of public peptide databases. PeptideCutter was used to predict the mass values of various chemerin isoforms and to predict tryptic chemerin fragments (www.expasy.org). Serum Serine Proteases Activate Chemerin—Serum is significantly more potent than plasma in inducing the chemotaxis of CMKLR1-positive cells (5Zabel B.A. Silverio A.M. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), suggesting that clotting might activate proteases capable of cleaving plasma chemerin to an active form. To test this hypothesis, we stripped serum of endogenous heparin-binding proteins (including chemerin) by passing it over a heparin column. This treatment effectively removed the endogenous serum chemotactic activity (Fig. 1). However, incubation of the undiluted stripped serum with recombinant full-length pro-chemerin dramatically enhanced the chemotactic activity of the protein. The triggering event was rapid, as chemerin chemotactic activity peaked within 5 min at 37 °C (data not shown). Aprotinin, a general serine protease inhibitor (but not the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64), blocked chemerin activation by stripped serum, indicating that serum serine proteases are required for chemerin activation. Furthermore, the canonical serine protease trypsin also activated chemerin, consistent with a direct activity of serine proteases on the attractant (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEIsolated serine proteases of the coagulation, fibrinolytic, and inflammatory cascades activate chemerin Recombinant full-length pro-chemerin was titered to yield low initial activity (<4.5 ± 0.4% CMKLR1 transfectant migration) and was incubated for 5–10 min at 37 °C with the indicated enzymes (basal migration was <1.7 ± 0.4). Plasmin was used at levels corresponding to physiologic blood plasminogen levels (2.6 × 10-6 m), as well as 10× higher. Enzyme concentrations corresponding to 10× the physiologic blood zymogen levels are displayed for factor VIIa, factor XIIa, and C1s. The concentrations used for uPA and tPA were those reported for mediating in vitro clot lysis (13Guimaraes A.H. Rijken D.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 91: 473-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For chemerin chemotactic activity, the mean of duplicate wells of representative experiments (of 2–4 performed with similar results) is shown with the range in each case. For percent of maximal migration, the intra-experimental chemotactic responses for chemerin alone were subtracted from each sample, and a ratio based on the best observed chemotactic response (10× plasmin) is displayed.

At physiologic blood plasminogen concentrations (and even concentrations 10× lower, not shown), plasmin, an abundant blood and tissue serine protease that cleaves fibrin and leads to clot lysis, was a potent chemerin-activator (TABLE ONE). At concentrations 10× higher than physiologic blood zymogen levels, plasmin in particular, but also coagulation cascade factors VIIa and XIIa were potent activators of chemerin (TABLE ONE). Although the effect was reduced when factors XIIa and VIIa were used at physiologic blood levels, they still generated significant activated chemerin, similar to the activating ability of serum (not shown). None of the other serine proteases of the coagulation cascade showed significant activity in the range tested (0.1–10× blood levels, data not shown). The serine proteases uPA and tPA cleave plasminogen to generate plasmin. Interestingly, these enzymes also activate chemerin (TABLE ONE). Although the enzyme concentrations required were higher (1000–10,000-fold) than their observed plasma zymogen levels (9Jandl J.H. Blood: Textbook of Hematology, 2nd Ed.. Little, Brown, and Company, Boston1996: 1213-1275Google Scholar), the uPA concentration was similar to the level required to cleave its primary physiologic target, plasminogen (11Vakili J.

Both plasminogen activators display increased abilities to activate plasminogen when in the bound state (14Ellis V. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4806-4813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol.

Thus uPA and tPA may play a role in chemerin activation in vivo when concentrated on cell or matrix surfaces. To determine whether plasmin generates a discrete active cleavage product of chemerin, we digested recombinant chemerin with plasmin under controlled conditions and evaluated the products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Incubation with a minimal amount of plasmin (6.4 × 10-9 m) over 48 h at 37 °C generated a single primary proteolytic product, associated with a 20-fold increase in chemotactic potency compared with the starting material (data not shown). (Note that the recombinant chemerin contains a small amount of a spontaneously cleaved form as well; this form may be responsible for the low level of initial chemotactic activity prior to incubation with plasmin. Using a monoclonal antibody specific to the full-length form, Wittamer et al. (3Wittamer V. Franssen J.D. Vulcano M. Mirjolet J.F. Le Poul E. Migeotte I. Brezillon S. Tyldesley R. Blanpain C.

Med. 2003; 198: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) showed that full-length chemerin, when purified from spontaneous cleavage products, had no detectable chemotactic activity.) Neutrophil Granule Proteases Cathepsin G and Elastase Activate Chemerin—Neutrophils are recruited early to sites of acute inflammation and, when activated, release an array of enzymes and factors that regulate the inflammatory process, including the recruitment of other leukocytes (16Tani K. Ogushi F. Shimizu T. Sone S. J. Med. Invest. 2001; 48: 133-141PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether neutrophils release proteases that activate chemerin, we initially incubated recombinant full-length chemerin with neutrophil-conditioned media. The media displayed potent gelatinolytic activity, indicating the release of neutrophil granule proteinases (data not shown). Neutrophil-conditioned medium, itself, had no chemotactic activity for CMKLR1 transfectants, but it displayed significant chemerin-activating ability (Fig. 2). Pefabloc, a general serine protease inhibitor, significantly blocked chemerin activation (Fig. 2), indicating that serine proteases released upon neutrophil degranulation activate chemerin. The serine proteases elastase and cathepsin G are major components of primary (azurophil) granules of neutrophils. Both proteinases generated active chemerin (TABLE ONE). Inhibition of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G by their selective inhibitors, α1-proteinase inhibitor and α1-antichymotrypsin, respectively, abrogated chemerin activation (data not shown). Direct enzymatic activity, therefore, is required for the protease-induced generation of the active chemoattractant. Serine Proteases of the Complement Cascade Are Weak Effectors—Serine proteases of the complement cascade trigger complement components that act as potent leukocyte attractants. Therefore, we evaluated the chemerin activation ability of factors B, D, and I, and C2, C1r, and C1s. At concentrations 10-fold higher than their blood zymogen levels (and within the range of the reported concentrations used for cleavage of their respective complement substrates, i.e. factor I cleavage of C3b (17Ekdahl K.N.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 5202-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)), only C1s had a weak but detectable effect on chemerin potency (TABLE ONE). Mast Cell Tryptase Is a Potent Chemerin Activator—Mast cell granules contain heparin, histamine, and numerous proteinases, the most abundant being the serine protease tryptase. Mast cell tryptase also circulates in the body, and although serum tryptase levels are quite low in healthy individuals (<1 × 10-10 m), they can be 10–100-fold higher in patients undergoing anaphylactic reactions (21Dybendal T.

Although low concentrations of tryptase (5.2 × 10-11 m) did not activate chemerin, higher concentrations (5.2 × 10-9 m) served as a potent activator (TABLE ONE).

To identify the site of cleavage of serum chemerin, we isolated the active peptide from serum as described previously (5Zabel B.A. Silverio A.M. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and carried out mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF) analysis of tryptic peptides. Peptides identified covered 55% of the protein sequence. In addition to peptides with canonical tryptic cleavage sites, one peptide displayed a mass value of 1669.7 Da, corresponding to a non-tryptic peptide comprising amino acids 141–155 from the carboxyl terminus of chemerin (Fig. 3, A and B). This peptide defines the carboxyl-terminal processing site of serum chemerin NH2...FA ↓ FSKALPRS... COOH (Fig. 3, B and C). In corroboration, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of a chemerin-enriched fraction from human serum displayed a peak with a mass value of 15648.1 Da, within 5.2 Da of the predicted value of the truncated form above (15642.9 Da) (data not shown). This cleavage site is distinct from those defined previously by Meder et al. (4Meder W. Wendland M. Busmann A. Kutzleb C. Spodsberg N. John H. Richter R. Schleuder D. Meyer M. Forssmann W.G.

Distinct Carboxyl-terminal Chemerin Cleavage Sites for Plasmin, Elastase, and Tryptase—To define the sites of chemerin cleavage by specific activating enzymes, we carried out controlled digestion of the recombinant full-length molecule to generate the active form(s) and used electrospray and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to define the cleavage products. This approach identified a single dominant plasmin carboxyl-terminal peptide cleavage site as NH2... FAFSK ↓ ALPRS-COOH. This is a canonical serine protease (trypsin) cleavage site, as predicted by PeptideCutter software (www.expasy.org). Several carboxyl-terminal cleavage sites were observed following controlled activation with neutrophil elastase, consistent with its less discriminating activity and its preference for cleaving bonds adjacent to small, often hydrophobic residues. One of these is the same as that of the endogenously active chemerin in serum, NH2... FA ↓ FSKALPRS... COOH. As summarized in Fig. 3C, mast cell tryptase also generated several distinct carboxyl-terminal cleavage products, including the serum form. The ubiquitous distribution of pro-chemerin is reminiscent of the prevalent expression of tissue factor in non-vascular sites. Tissue factor is the most potent activator of the clotting cascade and provides a “hemostatic envelope” (24Drake T.A. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W2038863154,"Signalling pathways mediating the transduction of information between cells are essential for development, cellular differentiation and homeostasis1. Their dysregulation is also frequently associated with human malignancies. The Janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway represents one such signalling cascade whose evolutionarily conserved roles include cell proliferation and haematopoiesis2. Here we describe a systematic genome-wide survey for genes required for JAK/STAT pathway activity. Analysis of 20,026 RNA interference (RNAi)-induced phenotypes in cultured Drosophila melanogaster haemocyte-like cells identified interacting genes encoding 4 known and 86 previously uncharacterized proteins. Subsequently, cell-based epistasis experiments were used to classify these proteins on the basis of their interaction with known components of the signalling cascade. In addition to multiple human disease gene homologues, we have found the tyrosine phosphatase Ptp61F and the Drosophila homologue of BRWD3, a bromo-domain-containing protein disrupted in leukaemia3. Moreover, in vivo analysis demonstrates that disrupted dBRWD3 and overexpressed Ptp61F function as suppressors of leukaemia-like blood cell tumours. This screen represents a comprehensive identification of novel loci required for JAK/STAT signalling and provides molecular insights into an important pathway relevant for human cancer. Human homologues of identified pathway modifiers may constitute targets for therapeutic interventions."

This amplification behavior is similar in a range of observations and climate model simulations and is consistent with basic theory. On multidecadal time scales, tropospheric amplification of surface warming is a robust feature of model simulations, but it occurs in only one observational data set. Other observations show weak, or even negative, amplification. These results suggest either that different physical mechanisms control amplification processes on monthly and decadal time scales, and models fail to capture such behavior; or (more plausibly) that residual errors in several observational data sets used here affect their representation of long-term trends."

Both AgRP and NPY stimulate food intake when administered into the third ventricle and are up-regulated in states of negative energy balance. However, mice with targeted deletion of either NPY or AgRP or both do not have major alterations in energy homeostasis. Using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenesis we have targeted expression of a neurotoxic CAG expanded form of ataxin-3 to AgRP-expressing neurons in the arcuate. This resulted in a 47% loss of AgRP neurons by 16 weeks of age, a significantly reduced body weight, (wild-type mice (WT) 34.7+/-0.7 g vs. transgenic mice (Tg) 28.6+/-0.6 g, P<0.001), and reduced food intake (WT 5.0+/-0.2 vs. Tg 3.6+/-0.1 g per day, P<0.001). Transgenic mice had significantly reduced total body fat, plasma insulin, and increased brown adipose tissue UCP1 expression. Transgenic mice failed to respond to peripherally administered ghrelin but retained sensitivity to PYY 3-36.

https://openalex.org/W2126752581,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young people in industrialized countries. Although various anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic modalities have shown neuroprotective effects in experimental models of TBI, to date, no specific pharmacological agent aimed at blocking the progression of secondary brain damage has been approved for clinical use. Erythropoietin (Epo) belongs to the cytokine superfamily and has traditionally been viewed as a hematopoiesis-regulating hormone. The newly discovered neuroprotective properties of Epo lead us to investigate its effect in TBI in a mouse model of closed head injury. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) was injected at 1 and 24 h after TBI, and the effect on recovery of motor and cognitive functions, tissue inflammation, axonal degeneration, and apoptosis was evaluated up to 14 days. Motor deficits were lower, cognitive function was restored faster, and less apoptotic neurons and caspase-3 expression were found in rhEpo-treated as compared with vehicle-treated animals (P<0.05). Axons at the trauma area in rhEpo-treated mice were relatively well preserved compared with controls (shown by their density; P<0.01). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a reduced activation of glial cells by staining for GFAP and complement receptor type 3 (CD11b/CD18) in the injured hemisphere of Epo- vs. vehicle-treated animals. We propose that further studies on Epo in TBI should be conducted in order to consider it as a novel therapy for TBI."
https://openalex.org/W2028811283,"Voltage-gated ion channels open and close in response to voltage changes across electrically excitable cell membranes. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are homotetramers with each subunit constructed from six transmembrane segments, S1-S6 (ref. 2). The voltage-sensing domain (segments S1-S4) contains charged arginine residues on S4 that move across the membrane electric field, modulating channel open probability. Understanding the physical movements of this voltage sensor is of fundamental importance and is the subject of controversy. Recently, the crystal structure of the KvAP channel motivated an unconventional 'paddle model' of S4 charge movement, indicating that the segments S3b and S4 might move as a unit through the lipid bilayer with a large (15-20-A) transmembrane displacement. Here we show that the voltage-sensor segments do not undergo significant transmembrane translation. We tested the movement of these segments in functional Shaker K+ channels by using luminescence resonance energy transfer to measure distances between the voltage sensors and a pore-bound scorpion toxin. Our results are consistent with a 2-A vertical displacement of S4, not the large excursion predicted by the paddle model. This small movement supports an alternative model in which the protein shapes the electric field profile, focusing it across a narrow region of S4 (ref. 6)."

An understanding of the mechanisms that regulate Wee1 should provide new insight into how cells make the decision to enter mitosis. We report here that Swe1, the budding-yeast homolog of Wee1, is directly regulated by Cdk1. Phosphorylation of Swe1 by Cdk1 activates Swe1 and is required for formation of a stable Swe1-Cdk1 complex that maintains Cdk1 in the inhibited state. Dephosphorylation of Cdk1 leads to further phosphorylation of Swe1 and release of Cdk1. Thus, Cdk1 both positively and negatively regulates its own inhibitor. Regulation of the Swe1-Cdk1 complex is likely to play a critical role in controlling the transition into mitosis."

A proposed mechanism in which rifamycins sterically block the extension of nascent RNA beyond three nucleotides does not alone explain why certain RNAP mutations confer resistance to some but not other rifamycins. Here we show that unlike rifampicin and rifapentin, and contradictory to the steric model, rifabutin inhibits formation of the first and second phosphodiester bonds. We report 2.5 Å resolution structures of rifabutin and rifapentin complexed with the Thermus thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme. The structures reveal functionally important distinct interactions of antibiotics with the initiation σ factor. Strikingly, both complexes lack the catalytic Mg2+ ion observed in the apo-holoenzyme, whereas an increase in Mg2+ concentration confers resistance to rifamycins. We propose that a rifamycin-induced signal is transmitted over ∼19 Å to the RNAP active site to slow down catalysis. Based on structural predictions, we designed enzyme substitutions that apparently interrupt this allosteric signal. Rifamycins, the clinically important antibiotics, target bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP).

We propose that a rifamycin-induced signal is transmitted over ∼19 Å to the RNAP active site to slow down catalysis. Based on structural predictions, we designed enzyme substitutions that apparently interrupt this allosteric signal. Bacterial RNAP holoenzyme, composed of a catalytic core (α2ββ’ω subunits) and a σ-specificity factor, binds to a promoter and initiates reiterative abortive synthesis of short RNA products. Once a stable, ≥8 nt-long RNA primer is synthesized to form an 8–9 bp RNA/DNA hybrid, RNAP leaves the promoter and enters a highly processive elongation state that persists for thousands of nucleotide addition cycles. Rifamycins (Rifs) that were discovered nearly 50 years ago as fermentation by-products of Streptomyces mediterranei sp. (for a comprehensive review, see Floss and Yu, 2005Floss H.G. Yu T.W. Rifamycin-mode of action, resistance, and biosynthesis.Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) strongly inhibit synthesis of short RNAs but do not affect stable transcription elongation complexes (Sippel and Hartmann, 1970Sippel A.E. Hartmann G.R. Rifampicin resistance of RNA polymerase in the binary complex with DNA.Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Rifamycins still retain their prominence as the first-line antibiotics in combating tuberculosis; however, their efficiency and versatility is limited by the rapid emergence of resistant bacteria. To overcome this problem, one needs to understand the detailed mechanisms of both the Rifs’ action and the bacterial resistance to these drugs. Rifs belong to a group of ansamycin antibiotics that contain an aromatic naphthoquinone moiety (ansa ring) with a variable “tail” attached to the C3 and/or C4 positions (Figure 1A ). The range of antibacterial activity for different C3/C4-substituted Rifs can easily span several orders of magnitude (Maggi et al., 1965Maggi N. Pallanza R. Sensi P. New derivatives of rifamycin SV.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1965; 5: 765-769PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that most of the efforts in drug design were concentrated on the creation of new C3/C4 substituted variants. Three Rifs are currently used in therapy: rifampicin (RFP), rifapentin (RPN), and rifabutin (RFB). However, functional in vitro analysis of the inhibitory mechanism focused only on RFP. The structure of the Thermus aquaticus core RNAP (taqRNAP) in complex with RFP determined at 3.3 Å resolution (Campbell et al., 2001Campbell E.A. Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Murakami K. Nair S.

This suggested an intuitive and simple model in which RFP sterically blocks synthesis of an RNA product longer than 3 nt, and all β substitutions that confer resistance to RFP do so by distorting its binding pocket. However, several observations cannot be easily reconciled with the simple steric hindrance mechanism (Table 1). Some of these discrepancies could be due to the fact that the structure was obtained with a nonphysiological RFP target (core enzyme); indeed, crosslinking of the Rif tail to the σ subunit has been reported (Mustaev et al., 1994Mustaev A. Zaychikov E. Severinov K. Kashlev M. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Topology of the RNA polymerase active center probed by chimeric rifampicin-nucleotide compounds.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Most importantly, this model fails to account for the existence of rpoB mutants that are resistant to RFP and RPN yet sensitive to RFB in vivo (Wichelhaus et al., 2001Wichelhaus T. Schafer V.

First, we demonstrated that the tails confer differential effects on transcription in vitro. Second, we have determined the high-resolution structures of RPN and RFB in complex with the T. thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme (ttRNAP) and performed systematic analysis of Rif-RNAP contacts. Third, we showed that distinct contacts of RPN and RFB tails to σ correlated with their patterns of RNAP inhibition. While our data do not exclude the steric model as a critical step of the Rifs’ inhibition mechanism, they argue that Rifs also inhibit transcription at earlier steps through an allosteric signal that disfavors binding of the Mg2+ ion in the active site, thus slowing down catalysis and facilitating dissociation of short RNA transcripts. This model adequately explains observations that are at odds with the steric-block mechanism. Differential bactericidal effects of Rif tails were thought to result from different permeability of bacterial cell walls to individual rifamycins (Brufani et al., 1982Brufani M. Cellai L. Cerrini S. Fedeli W. Segre A. Vaciago A. Structure-activity relationships in the ansamycins. Molecular structure and activity of 3-carbomethoxy rifamycin S.Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 394-399PubMed Google Scholar). However, direct differential effects on transcription were also noted (Wehrli and Staehelin, 1969Wehrli W. Staehelin M. The rifamycins--relation of chemical structure and action on RNA polymerase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 182: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In order to directly assess the impact of tail variations, we compiled a set of rifamycins that differ in the structure and position of tail attachment and tested their effects on transcription by E. coli RNAP in vitro (Figure 1B). Consistent with previous reports (McClure and Cech, 1978McClure W.R. Cech C.L. On the mechanism of rifampicin inhibition of RNA synthesis.J. Biol.

This pattern of inhibition is shared by all rifamycins tested with tails attached to C3 (Figure 1B and data not shown). In contrast, RFB and rifamexyl (RMX), whose tails are attached to C3/C4 positions, inhibited even the first phosphodiester bond formation (Figure 1B). To ascertain whether structurally different Rifs make distinct contacts with the enzyme, we obtained crystals of ttRNAP holoenzyme with Rifs from each class, RPN and RFB. We chose RPN for structural studies because of its greater stability in solution and because we did not detect any qualitative or quantitative differences between RFP and RPN in either in vivo or in vitro assays. Though the crystals used in these studies were obtained in the same crystallization conditions and belonged to the same space group as the previously reported structures, they exhibited a substantial increase (∼2%) in all unit cell parameters that make them nonisomorphous with the previous crystals (Vassylyev et al., 2002Vassylyev D.G.

To ensure adequate comparison of the ttRNAP/Rif complexes with the apo-holoenzyme, we collected diffraction data and refined the structure of the native apo-holoenzyme in this crystal form at 2.8 Å resolution (R factor = 23.1%, Rfree = 26.8%) in addition to the RNAP/RPN (R factor = 23.0%, Rfree = 26.7%) and RNAP/RFB (R factor = 22.5%, Rfree = 25.7%) structures refined at 2.5 Å resolution (Table 2 and Figure S1). This crystal form exhibited only one significant difference from published ttRNAP structures—the bridge helix was uniform (straight), in contrast to the previously observed, locally distorted (with the two residues flipped out of the helix) conformation (Vassylyev et al., 2002Vassylyev D.G.

This difference, however, was observed in all three structures and therefore cannot be attributed to the Rifs’ binding (Supplemental “RNAP structure”).Table 2Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsApo-holoenzymeRNAP/RPNRNAP/RFBSpace groupP65aThe crystals belong to P32 space group with a perfect (50%) merohedral twinning mimicking P65 space group.

As the uniform conformation of the bridge was previously observed only in eukaryotic RNAP, the finding that both conformations can exist in the same (bacterial) system further supports the earlier hypothesis that the local flipping of the bridge helix is universal for multisubunit RNAPs and may mediate DNA translocation during transcription (Cramer et al., 2001Cramer P.

Surprisingly, although high concentrations of magnesium formate (∼15 mM) and a nearly physiological pH (6.5) were used for crystallization, the high-affinity Mg2+ ion, bound to the catalytic β’ Asp residues (positions 460, 462, and 464; throughout the text, the Escherichia coli numbering is used) was absent from all four independent RNAP molecules from the two Rif complexes. In contrast, this ion was observed in all previous multisubunit RNAP structures, as well as in isomorphous apo-holoenzyme crystals as revealed by the difference electron density (ED) built using |Fnati − Frif| coefficients, where Fnati and Frif are the structure factors for the apo-holoenzyme and Rif complexes, respectively, and the phases are from the partially refined apo-holoenzyme structure (Figure 2A ). The same phases, but with reversed |Frif − Fnati| coefficients, revealed the clear ED for RPN and RFB (Figures 2B and 2C) that allowed unambiguous fit of the antibiotics in the complexes. RPN and RFB bound to the same site on ttRNAP as did RFP in the taqRNAP/RFP complex (Campbell et al., 2001Campbell E.A. Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Murakami K. Nair S. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Structural mechanism for rifampicin inhibition of bacterial rna polymerase.Cell. 2001; 104: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), with positions and contacts of the two ansa rings nearly superimposable (Figure 2D). The Rif binding site is highly conserved among bacteria: amino acid sequences in the vicinity of the Rif contacts are identical between T. thermophilus and T. aquaticus RNAPs, whereas the evolutionarily distant E. coli sequence is 82% identical and 90% homologous to both (Figure 3A ), indicating that structural results obtained with T. thermophilus RNAP would be applicable to other bacterial species. RPN differs from RFP by only a few extra atoms that make no interactions with the protein, allowing for direct comparison between the ttRNAP/RPN(RFB) and taqRNAP/RFP complexes at the atomic level. Similar to those in the taqRNAP/RFP complex, most contacts in the ttRNAP/Rif complexes were observed between the β subunit residues and the ansa rings (Figures 3B and 3C). However, the network of the polar interactions with the ring system was much more extensive, comprising eighteen versus eight hydrogen bonds in the taqRNAP/RFP complex (Campbell et al., 2001Campbell E.A.

Numerous screens for Rif-resistant isolates have been performed, yielding important insights into rifampicin action (Jin and Gross, 1988Jin D.J. Gross C.A.

The crucial differences between the ttRNAP and taqRNAP polar contacts with Rifs involve βArg529, βGln513, and βHis526, which form three, four, and two hydrogen bonds with four Rif oxygen atoms in ttRNAP, respectively; only one such bond is formed by each of these residues in taqRNAP. These oxygen atoms are known to be essential for Rif inhibition (Bacchi et al., 1998Bacchi A. Pelizzi G. Nebuloni M. Ferrari P. Comprehensive study on structure-activity relationships of rifamycins: discussion of molecular and crystal structure and spectroscopic and thermochemical properties of rifamycin O.J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and are rigidly fixed by the Rifs’ backbone. Furthermore, βArg529, βGln513, and βHis526 form additional polar contacts with each other, thus creating an intricate RNAP/Rifs recognition pattern (Figures 3B and 3C). Such a concerted mode of binding implies that the exclusion of a single interacting group (either in RNAP or Rifs) would not only eliminate its specific contacts but also would likely disturb the entire interaction network and lead to a dramatic loss in binding affinity. Underscoring their functional importance, substitutions of βArg529, βGln513, and βHis526 side chains for smaller ones conferred strong Rif resistance, whereas elimination of other RNAP/Rif polar interactions elicited smaller effects (Figure 3). The ttRNAP/Rif structures also revealed additional contacts of βArg143 and βGln510 with Rifs. Notably, the hydrogen bond between taqβAsp516 and O2 of Rif, which has been invoked to explain strong RFP resistance of the βAsp516 mutants, was not observed in the ttRNAP complexes and the substitution of the E. coli βAsp516 for Ala did not elicit strong RFP resistance (Figure 3A). These disparities could be attributed to the lower resolution of the taqRNAP/RFP structure; indeed, a brief analysis of the recently improved structure of taqRNAP/RFP complex (Campbell et al., 2005Campbell E.A. Pavlova O. Zenkin N. Leon F. Irschik H. Jansen R. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Structural, functional, and genetic analysis of sorangicin inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) indicates that both the overall taqRNAP structure and the Rif binding pocket resemble the ttRNAP conformation far more closely than the previously published taqRNAP/RFP complex (Campbell et al., 2001Campbell E.A. Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Murakami K. Nair S. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Structural mechanism for rifampicin inhibition of bacterial rna polymerase.Cell. 2001; 104: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). In particular, the βAsp516/RFP hydrogen bond is also missing in the updated taqRNAP/RFP structure. However, significant differences in Rifs contacts still remain between the ttRNAP/Rifs and the improved taqRNAP/RFP structures. The ttRNAP/RPN and ttRNAP/RFB complexes also revealed contacts between the antibiotics and the σ subunit that were strikingly different in RNAP1 and RNAP2 (Figures 4A and 4B). In RNAP1, the σ hairpin loop (σHL, E. coli σ70 residues 508–519) closely approached bound Rifs while the σAsp513 side chain formed nearly identical hydrogen bonds with O4 and O5 of RPN and RFB. In RNAP2, the σHL w"

https://openalex.org/W2064959471,"We have previously reported a cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) pedigree with early onset macular degeneration that develops drusen at 2 yr after birth. In this study, the molecular composition of drusen in monkeys affected with late onset and early onset macular degeneration was both characterized. Involvement of anti-retinalautoimmunity in the deposition of drusen and the pathogenesis of the disease was also evaluated. Funduscopic and histological examinations were performed on 278 adult monkeys (mean age=16.94 yr) for late onset macular degeneration. The molecular composition of drusen was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and/or direct proteome analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). Anti-retinal autoantibodies in sera were screened in 20 affected and 10 age-matched control monkeys by Western blot techniques. Immunogenic molecules were identified by 2D electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS. Relative antibody titer against each antigen was determined by ELISA in sera from 42 affected (late onset) and 41 normal monkeys. Yellowish-white spots in the macular region were observed in 90 (32%) of the late onset monkeys that were examined. Histological examination demonstrated that drusen or degenerative retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells were associated with the pigmentary abnormalities. Drusen in both late and early onset monkeys showed immunoreactivities for apolipoprotein E, amyloid P component, complement component C5, the terminal C5b-9 complement complex, vitronectin, and membrane cofactor protein. LC-MS/MS analyses identified 60 proteins as constituents of drusen, including a number of common components in drusen of human age-related macular degeneration (AMD), such as annexins, crystallins, immunoglobulins, and complement components. Half of the affected monkeys had single or multiple autoantibodies against 38, 40, 50, and 60 kDa retinal proteins. The reacting antigens of 38 and 40 kDa were identified as annexin II and mu-crystallin, respectively. Relative antibody titer against annexin II in affected monkeys was significantly higher than control animals (P<0.01). Significant difference was not observed in antibody titer against mu-crystallin; however, several affected monkeys showed considerably elevated titer (360-610%) compared with the mean for unaffected animals. Monkey drusen both in late and early onset forms of macular degeneration had common components with drusen in human AMD patients, indicating that chronic inflammation mediated by complement activation might also be involved in the formation of drusen in these affected monkeys. The high prevalence of anti-retinalautoantibodies in sera from affected monkeys demonstrated an autoimmune aspect of the pathogenesis of the disease. Although further analyses are required to determine whether and how autoantibodies against annexin II or mu-crystallin relate to the pathogenesis of the disease, it could be hypothesized that immune responses directed against these antigens might trigger chronic activation of the complement cascade at the site of drusen formation."

https://openalex.org/W2095326161,"In vascular tissue, T-cadherin (T-cad) is up-regulated in vivo under disease conditions associated with oxidative stress and concomitant cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis/survival. Using cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), we examined whether there is a functional relationship between oxidative stress, T-cad expression, and cell survival status. Culture of HUVEC under conditions of oxidative stress (e.g., serum deprivation, inclusion of H2O2) resulted in increased T-cad expression. Oxidative stress-induced increases in T-cad were inhibited by the free radical-scavenging antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, and the flavin-containing oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium. Thus reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to stress-induced elevation of T-cad in HUVEC. Compared with control cells, HUVEC overexpressing T-cad (T-cad+-HUVEC) had higher phosphorylation levels for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) target Akt and mTOR target p70(S6K) (survival pathway regulators), but lower levels for p38MAPK (death pathway regulator). T-cad+-HUVEC exposed to stress (serum-deprivation, TNF-alpha, actinomycin D, staurosporine) exhibited reduced caspase activation together with increased cell survival. Protection against stress-induced apoptosis in T-cad+-HUVEC was abrogated by either PI3K-inhibitor wortmannin or mTOR-inhibitor rapamycin. We conclude that T-cad overexpression in HUVEC protects against stress-induced apoptosis through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR survival signal pathway and concomitant suppression of the p38 MAPK proapoptotic pathway. ROS-induced changes in T-cad expression may play an important role in controlling tissue cellularity during vascular remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2083843080,"Hyperlipidemia (HL) impairs cardiac glucose homeostasis, but the molecular mechanisms involved are yet unclear. We examined HL-regulated GLUT4 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ gene expression in human cardiac muscle. Compared with control patients, GLUT4 protein levels were 30% lower in human cardiac muscle biopsies from patients with HL and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas GLUT4 mRNA levels were unchanged. PPARγ mRNA levels were 30-50% lower in patients with HL and/or diabetes mellitus type 2 than in controls. Reporter studies in H9C2 cardiomyotubes showed that HL in vitro, induced by high levels of arachidonic (AA) stearic, linoleic, and oleic acids (24 h, 200 μm) repressed transcription from the GLUT4 promoter; AA also repressed transcription from the PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 promoters. Co-expression of PPARγ2 repressed GLUT4 promoter activity, and the addition of AA further enhanced this effect. 5′-Deletion analysis revealed three GLUT4 promoter regions that accounted for AA-mediated effects: two repression-mediating sequences at -443/-423 bp and -222/-197 bp, the deletion of either or both of which led to a partial derepression of promoter activity, and a third derepression-mediating sequence at -612/-587 bp that was required for sustaining this derepression effect. Electromobility shift assay further shows that AA enhanced binding to two of the three regions of cardiac nuclear protein(s), the nature of which is still unknown. We propose that HL, exhibited as a high free fatty acid level, modulates GLUT4 gene expression in cardiac muscle via a complex mechanism that includes: (a) binding of AA mediator proteins to three newly identified response elements on the GLUT4 promoter gene and (b) repression of GLUT4 and the PPARγ genes by AA.

In critically hospitalized patients, intensive normalization of plasma glucose levels was shown to be most beneficial way to reduce the size of the ischemic zone during coronary ischemia (5van den Berghe G.

Insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue includes translocation of insulin-sensitive glucose transporters (GLUT4) from intracellular pools to the cell surface (6Karnieli E.

Biochem. 1992; 48: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Stresses such as ischemia, hypoxia, and high frequency contraction can also modulate GLUT4 expression (11Abel E.D. Kaulbach H.C.

Although GLUT4 knock-out mice are not diabetic, they do exhibit abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism, and cardiac hypertrophy is the most striking morphological consequence of ablation of GLUT4 expression (12Stenbit A.E.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ has a critical role in adipogenesis (13Wahli W. Braissant O. Desvergne B. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 261-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Two human PPARγ isoforms have been identified, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. We have shown that both repress transcription of the GLUT4 promoter in primary adipocytes and that rosiglitazone exerts its anti-diabetic effects by alleviating this repression (14Armoni M. Kritz N.

Although PPARγ2 is the main isoform expressed in adipocytes, both the γ1 and γ2 isoforms are found in muscle (15Gilde A.J. Van Bilsen M. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 178: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but their specific role in cardiac GLUT4 regulation is unknown. FFA represent an important link between obesity, insulin resistance, and DM2 (16Reaven G.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1993; 44: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Increased concentrations of plasma FFA in general, and AA in particular, inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into muscle (17Boden G. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). FFA-induced insulin resistance is mediated via activation of a serine kinase cascade that involves IκB kinase, leading to decreased translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport (18Hundal R.S. Petersen K.F. Mayerson A.B. Randhawa P.S. Inzucchi S. Shoelson S.E. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 19Kim J.K. Kim Y.J. Fillmore J.J.

Beyond that, FFA themselves exert a direct, membrane-independent influence on molecular events that govern gene expression (see reviews Refs. 20Sessler A.M. Ntambi J.M. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 21Duplus E. Glorian M. Forest C. J. Biol.

It is believed that the regulation of gene expression by dietary fats has the greatest impact on the development of insulin resistance and its related pathophysiologies. FFA have been found to modulate gene transcription, mRNA stability, and cellular differentiation (23Pegorier J.P. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 1998; 1: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Chronic exposure of adipocytes to AA represses GLUT4 gene expression at the levels of both transcription and mRNA destabilization (24Long S.D. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1138-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, less is known about FFA-induced regulation of PPARγ either at the level of gene transcription and or at the level of receptor activation. Therefore, we examined whether HL in vivo inhibits GLUT4 gene expression in hCM and whether PPARγ mediates this effect. We present a novel model suggesting that both AA and PPARγ repress GLUT4 transcription in vitro, whereas AA also represses PPARγ transcription. We suggest that the AA-mediated effect on PPARγ explains the discrepancy observed between repressed transcription from the GLUT4 promoter in vitro and its unchanged mRNA levels in vivo. Materials—T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Free fatty acids were from Sigma. 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Cell culture reagents were from Biological Industries (Beth-Haemek, Israel). Human Cardiac Muscle Biopsies—In vivo studies were preformed in human cardiac muscle. Biopsies from the right atrial appendage were obtained during elective coronary artery bypass surgery from patients with HL and/or DM2 and matched euglycemic controls. The Human Rights Committee of the Rambam Medical Center approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to the elective surgery. Cell Cultures—In vitro studies were performed in rat embryonal heart-derived H9C2 cells (ATCC CRL-1446), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 fibroblasts (ATCC CCL-61), and rat skeletal muscle-derived L6 myoblasts (ATCC CRL-1458). Human HeLa cells were a gift from Dr. Richard Pestell (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY) (25Wang C. Fu M. D'Amico M. Albanese C. Zhou J.N. Brownlee M. Lisanti M.P. Chatterjee V.K.

Cell cultures were grown in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (H9C2, L6, and HeLa) or Ham's F-12 medium (CHO-K1 cells) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. H9C2 and L6 cells were induced to differentiate into myotubes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum; differentiation was defined by morphological features and creatinine phosphokinase activity (26Schopf G. Rumpold H. Muller M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 884: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Northern Blot Analyses—Analysis of total cellular RNA by RT-PCR and Northern blots was preformed as detailed before (27Armoni M. Quon M.J. Maor G. Avigad S. Shapiro D.N. Harel C. Esposito D. Goshen Y. Yaniv I. Karnieli E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 5312-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of Proteins—Crude membrane fractions prepared from the human cardiac muscle biopsies and total cell lysates prepared from H9C2 myocytes were analyzed for presence of GLUT1 and GLUT4 proteins using Western blotting and specific antibodies, as described by us previously (7Klip A. Ramlal T. Young D.A. Holloszy J.O. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 28Armoni M. Harel C. Burvin R. Karnieli E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3292-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cellular 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake Rates—Fully differentiated H9C2 myotubes were incubated for 24 h in either the absence or presence of 200 μm AA. The next morning, the cells were transferred to Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) that was either supplemented or not with 10 nm insulin for 30 min at 25 °C. The cellular rates of [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake were assessed as described previously (28Armoni M. Harel C. Burvin R. Karnieli E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3292-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Expression Vectors and Luciferase Promoter Reporters—The expression vector encoding the wild-type mouse PPARγ2 in pSV-SPORT1, as well as luciferase-conjugated promoter reporters for GLUT1 (pGLUT1-P-Luc), GLUT4 (pGLUT4-P-Luc), and (AOX)3-Luc have been described previously (29Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar). A series of progressively 5′-deleted promoter reporters was generated from pGLUT4-P-Luc using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the sequences were confirmed by direct sequencing. The human PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 promoters in pGL3-Luc were obtained from Dr. Luis Fajas (CNRS INSERM, Strasbourg, France). Transient Expression and GLUT4 Promoter Reporter Assays—CHO-K1 and HeLa cells were plated in 100-mm dishes (750,000 cells/dish) and transfected 24 h later. H9C2 and L6 myotubes were transfected in the 8-day, fully differentiated state. Transfections were performed as previously described (14Armoni M. Kritz N. Harel C. Bar-Yoseph F. Chen H. Quon M.J.

One set of dishes, co-transfected with the (AOX)3-Luc promoter reporter, served as positive control for activation of PPARγ transcription. The next day, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0-300 μm of the indicated FFA (stearic, oleic, linoleic, or arachidonic acid; Sigma), and the cells were incubated for additional 24 h at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity as an internal control (30Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratorym, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16-17Google Scholar). Within each experiment, the values are expressed as percentages of the induced basal promoter reporter activity, i.e. the activity obtained in cells transfected with the reporter alone. Electromobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Based on data from 5′-deletion analysis, promoter-derived probes for EMSA were synthesized commercially (Sigma), and sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed and end-labeled. The nuclear extracts were prepared from H9C2 cardiomyotubes that had been preincubated with or without 200 μm AA for 24 h. Binding reactions and sample analysis by EMSA were performed as reported previously (14Armoni M. Kritz N. Harel C. Bar-Yoseph F. Chen H. Quon M.J. Karnieli E. J. Biol.

For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated with either anti-PPARγ or anti-HNF4α antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 10 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. Analytical Procedures—Plasma insulin levels were assessed by radioimmunoassay (Biodata, Milano, Italy). Serum FFA levels were assessed by HPLC and standard kits. Blood glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was assayed using the IMX system and its reagents (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed statistically using a two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired samples. The p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Clinical Characteristics of the Patients—The study groups consisted of patients with coronary arterial disease and various degrees of HL and/or DM2 and normoglycemic normolipidemic controls matched for age, sex, and weight (expressed as body mass index). Clinical data from these patients are shown in TABLE ONE. Control subjects (n = 24) had normal plasma levels of glucose, insulin, HbA1c, triglycerides, and cholesterol. The HL group (n = 19) had significantly higher levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol (as defined in Ref. 31Program National Cholesterol Education Circulation. 2002; 106: 3143-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (11202) Google Scholar) but did not have diabetes. A third group included DM2 patients, as defined in Ref. 32Diabetes Care. 2003; 26: S5-S20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, with fasting hyperglycemia, mild hyperinsulinemia, and elevated blood HbA1c. A fourth group (HL+DM2) included 23 patients with significantly higher levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol and co-existing DM2. The levels of seven major FFA were assessed in the sera of patients in the control and DM2 groups. Levels of all FFA examined were significantly higher in patients with DM2 or hyperlipidemia than in the euglycemic controls (TABLE TWO).TABLE ONEClinical data of the patients The data are presented as the means ± S.E. of the individual values obtained in each group.

Compared with controls, GLUT4 protein was expressed at levels ∼30% lower in HL and DM2-derived hCM, whereas levels of GLUT1 protein were slightly elevated. Levels of GLUT1 mRNA (assessed in the same hCM samples) were only slightly elevated in HL patients and were unchanged in both DM2 and HL+DM2 patients (HL, 116 ± 11%; DM2, 100 ± 8%; and HL+DM2, 88 ± 12%; p ≥ 0.05 versus controls), whereas GLUT4 mRNA levels were not different from control levels in any of the groups (HL 92 ± 7%; DM2 100 ± 5%; and HL+DM2 91 ± 7%; p ≥ 0.05 versus controls). To explore the discrepancy observed between GLUT4 gene regulation at the mRNA and protein levels, PPARγ mRNA levels were assessed, because PPARγ has been suggested to mediate some of the effects of FFA at the level of transcription (33Guan H.P. Ishizuka T. Chui P.C. Lehrke M. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Indeed, although PPARγ mRNA levels in hCM were unaffected by DM2 (89% ± 10% p ≥ 0.05 versus controls) and only mildly decreased in HL (76% ± 6%, p ≥ 0.05 versus controls), a major decrease was observed in the HL+DM2 group (53 ± 6%; p < 0.05 versus controls). This suggests that HL and DM2 may act synergistically to repress PPARγ gene expression, leading to derepression of GLUT4. Characterization of H9C2 Cardiomyotubes—To establish the validity of this cell line as a cellular model for cardiac muscle, we studied the endogenous expression of GLUT4 upon differentiation. Reduction of fetal calf serum from 10% to 2% for 1 week caused the cells to differentiate into myocytes and then into myotubes, reaching maximal differentiation at 8 days post-serum starvation. Maximal differentiation was determined by morphological features (Fig. 2A) and creatinine phosphokinase enzymatic activity, which was elevated more than 10-fold in differentiated myotubes (Fig. 2B). Gene expression at the mRNA level was assessed by RT-PCR analysis using the primers detailed in TABLE THREE. This analysis revealed that H9C2 myoblasts express mRNA for GLUT1 but not GLUT4, whereas cellular differentiation into myotubes resulted in a clear induction of endogenous GLUT4 mRNA and protein (Fig. 2, C and D). We evaluated GLUT4 protein expression in H9C2 cells at -4, 0, 6, 7, and 8 days of serum starvation (Fig. 2D) and found that GLUT4 protein is maximally expressed in H9C2 myotubes at day 6, reaching ∼40% of the level found in normal rat skeletal muscle. The size of the GLUT4 protein in differentiated H9C2 cells was ∼50 kDa, which is the same as that normally found in fully differentiated rat muscle cells. To further establish that the expressed GLUT4 is functionally active, basal and insulin-stimulated rates of 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake were assessed in 8-day fully differentiated H9C2 myotubes that had been incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 200 μm AA in the medium. Incubation with AA increased basal glucose uptake rates by about 160%, and insulin did not stimulate glucose uptake any further beyond this (data not shown). These results are consistent with findings from Nugent et al. (34Nugent C. Prins J.B. Whitehead J.P. Wentworth J.M. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9149-9157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), who reported that AA potentiated basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by increasing the levels of both GLUT1 and GLUT4 at the cell surface. To further validate the suitability of H9C2 as our experimental model, fully differentiated H9C2 myotubes were incubated for 24 h either with or without 200 μm AA, and the total cellular level of GLUT4 proteins was assessed by Western immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2E, AA treatment significantly decreased the total level of GLUT4 proteins by as much as 40% below basal levels.TABLE THREESequences of primers used in RT-PCR The sense and anti-sense primers specific for the detection of mRNA for β-actin, GLUT1, GLUT4, and PPARγ were synthesized based on sequences obtained from GenBank™, as detailed previously (27Armoni M. Quon M.J. Maor G. Avigad S. Shapiro D.N. Harel C. Esposito D. Goshen Y. Yaniv I. Karnieli E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 5312-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The primers for the detection of the PPARγ isoforms were according to Fajas et al. (40Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.C. Deeb S.

FFA Repress Transcriptional Activity from the GLUT4 Gene Promoter—We next studied the effects of FFA on GLUT4 gene regulation at promoter level. Fully differentiated H9C2 myotubes were co-transfected with the GLUT4-P-Luc promoter reporter and incubated with 0-300 μm of stearic, oleic, linoleic, or arachidonic acid. As shown in Fig. 3, all FFA tested repressed transcription from the GLUT4 promoter by ∼20-40% at 100 μm and by ∼60% at 200 μm. Specifically, incubation of cells with 200 μm of arachidonic, stearic, oleic, or linoleic acid repressed GLUT4 promoter activity to 42, 36, 31, and 39%, respectively, of basal level (all differences are significant at p < 0.05 level). Because of the central role of AA in cellular metabolism and its known ability to regulate GLUT4 gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (24Long S.D. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1138-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we further investigated its effects on GLUT4 promoter activity in both insulin-responsive and nonresponsive cell types (Fig. 3B). In all cell types examined, GLUT4 promoter activity was repressed by AA in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum of 40-60% repression at 100-200 μm. Under similar conditions, AA also repressed the GLUT1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, to a maximum of 30% (data not shown). To differentiate between direct and indirect effects of AA, we utilized a nonmetabolized analog of AA, ETYA. ETYA repressed GLUT4 much less than AA (Fig. 3C). This diminished effect of ETYA, a potent inhibitor of both lipoxygenase and cycloxygenase and an activator of PPARs (24Long S.D. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1138-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggests that a second pathway may exist in which AA directly represses GLUT4 gene expression at the promoter level. PPARγ as Mediator of AA Effects on GLUT4 Promoter Activity—FFA and their metabolites are ligands of PPARγ receptors and play key roles in many cellular events, including regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis (33Guan H.P. Ishizuka T."
https://openalex.org/W1980824786,"There is now consensus that the accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins is cytotoxic and causally related to several age-related diseases, including the amyloid diseases and age-related cataracts. There is also general agreement that proteolytic pathways provide a quality control mechanism to limit accumulation of damaged proteins. Although many researchers assume that the ubiquitin pathway is involved in recognition and proteolytic removal of oxidatively modified proteins, which are produced upon cellular stress, there has been no direct evidence to support this hypothesis. In this work, we used a novel proteolysis-resistant ubiquitin variant to demonstrate that ubiquitin conjugates isolated from oxidatively stressed mammalian cells are enriched 3.3-15-fold for oxidatively modified proteins and that failure to execute ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis renders various cell types more susceptible to oxidative stress-related cytotoxicity. These results were corroborated using several inhibitors of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, including PS-341, an anticancer drug in clinical use. Taken together the data indicate that the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway recognizes and removes oxidatively modified proteins, and that failure of this system, as occurs upon aging or stress, may be involved in and exacerbate cytotoxicity and age-related syndromes in which accumulation of ubiquitinated and oxidatively modified proteins has an etiologic role."

Atomistic simulation using a quantum-mechanically derived bond-order potential shows that in iridium, two core structures for the screw dislocation are possible: a glissile planar core and a metastable nonplanar core. Transformation between the two core structures is athermal and leads to exceptionally high rates of cross slip during plastic deformation. Associated with this athermal cross slip is an exponential increase in the dislocation density and strong work hardening from which brittle cleavage is a natural consequence."

https://openalex.org/W1981018823,"Single in-frame amber (UAG) codons are found in the genes encoding MtmB, MtbB, or MttB, the methyltransferases initiating methane formation from monomethylamine, dimethylamine, or trimethylamine, respectively, in certain Archaea. The crystal structure of MtmB demonstrated that the amber codon codes for pyrrolysine, the 22nd genetically encoded amino acid found in nature. Previous attempts to visualize the amber-encoded residue by mass spectrometry identified only lysine, leaving information on the existence and structure of pyrrolysine resting entirely on crystallography of a single protein. Here we report successful mass spectral characterization of naturally occurring pyrrolysine and the first demonstration of the amber-encoded residue in proteins other than MtmB. The sequencing of chymotryptic fragments from acetonitrile-denatured proteins by tandem mass spectrometry revealed the mass of the amber-encoded residue in MtmB, MtbB, and MttB as 237.2 ± 0.2 Da. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry produced an accurate measurement for the pyrrolysyl-residue as 237.1456 Da, within error limits of the predicted mass based on the empirical formula C12H19N3O2. These measurements support the structure of pyrrolysine in MtmB as 4-methylpyrroline-5-carboxylate in amide linkage with the ϵN of lysine but not the alternative structure in which the 4-substituent of the pyrroline ring is an amine group. The presence of pyrrolysine with statistically identical mass in all three methyltransferases is in keeping with the proposed direct incorporation of pyrrolysine into protein during translation of the UAG codon and suggests that MtbB and MttB may exploit the unusual electrophilicity of pyrrolysine during catalysis.

Escherichia coli transformed with pylT (encoding tRNAPyl), pylS, and mtmB1 will suppress the amber codon in mtmB1 and produce full-length MtmB, but only if supplemented with exogenous pyrrolysine that is subsequently incorporated into the UAG position (3Blight S.K.

This is consistent with the in vitro binding of Escherichia coli EF-Tu with charged tRNAPyl (10Theobald-Dietrich A. Frugier M. Giege R. Rudinger-Thirion J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). UAG translation as pyrrolysine thus appears to involve ligation of cytoplasmic pyrrolysine to tRNAPyl by a dedicated pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase, much like the original set of 20 canonical amino acids. In contrast, the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine, follows a more indirect mechanism of genetic encoding. The selenocysteinyl-tRNASec required for UGA translation as selenocysteine is formed with seryl-tRNASec as an intermediate, not with free selenocysteine (11Driscoll D.M. Copeland P.R. Annu. Rev.

The deduced structure of pyrrolysine rests to date entirely on crystallographic structures of MtmB at 1.55-2.0 Å resolution (1Hao B. Gong W. Ferguson T.K. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Chan M.K.

These data indicated that pyrrolysine is lysine with the ϵ-nitrogen in amide linkage to (4R,5R)-4-substituted pyrroline-5-carboxylate (Fig. 1). The identity of the 4-substituent as either a methyl, hydroxy, or amine group could not be initially established with certainty; however, further analysis of hydroxylamine-derivatized pyrrolysine at 2.0 Å resolution has best supported a methyl group, which fits the electron density with an occupancy of 0.89. An amine group remained an admitted possibility, having an occupancy of 0.69 (8Hao B. Zhao G. Kang P.T. Soares J.A. Ferguson T.K. Gallucci J. Krzycki J.A. Chan M.K. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1317-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Attempts to further examine the pyrrolysyl residue by physical methods other than crystallography have had mixed success. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS) of intact MtmB revealed a mass 107 ± 2 Da larger than predicted if lysine were at the UAG-encoded position. However, the mass accuracy was insufficient to differentiate between the probable C-4 substituents (Fig. 1) or indeed to confirm if the increased mass of MtmB is due to the UAG-encoded residue (1Hao B. Gong W. Ferguson T.K. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Chan M.K. Science. 2002; 296: 1462-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Edman degradation and tandem MS of HPLC-purified tryptic fragments previously indicated lysine was present at the UAG-encoded position of MtmB (7James C.M. Ferguson T.K. Leykam J.F. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34252-34258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a result possibly due to hydrolysis of pyrrolysine. In addition to MMA, Methanosarcina barkeri and its close relatives can also form methane from trimethylamine (TMA) or dimethylamine (DMA), in reactions initiated by one of two methylamine methyltransferases that are not homologous to each other or to MtmB. MttB is specific for TMA (13Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 846-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas MtbB is selective for DMA (14Ferguson D.J. Gorlatova N. Grahame D.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29053-29060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The three types of methylamine methyltransferases each methylate a distinct corrinoid-binding protein (Fig. 2A) dedicated to the utilization of one type of methyltransferase. For MttB, MtbB, and MtmC, the cognate corrinoid proteins are MttC, MtbC, and MtmC, respectively. The corrinoid proteins are homologous to each other, as well as the cobalamin-binding domain of methionine synthase (15Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 16Paul L. Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Paul L. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The methylated cognate corrinoid protein of each methyltransferase can serve as substrate for a single methylcobamide:coenzyme M methyltransferase called MtbA (6Burke S.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16570-16577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5189-5194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The methyl-coenzyme M produced from this second methyltransferase reaction can then be converted to methane in the primary energy-yielding reaction of methanogenesis (19Thauer R.K.

A deviation from the standard genetic code is required not only for expression of the gene encoding MtmB, but also during expression of the genes encoding either MtbB or MttB (Fig. 2B). In M. barkeri MS, the DMA and TMA methyltransferase genes feature a single in-frame amber codon (16Paul L. Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two to three nearly identical copies of genes encoding each type of methyltransferase are present in the genomes of Methanosarcina spp., and all contain a single UAG codon (16Paul L. Ferguson D.J.

Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar). In M. barkeri MS, the 95% identical genes encoding MMA methyltransferase are termed mtmB1 and mtmB2, whereas the genes that could encode the DMA methyltransferase are termed mtbB1, mtbB2, and mtbB3. Only a single TMA methyltransferase gene, mttB, has been identified in M. barkeri MS (16Paul L. Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In all known examples of methanogen methylamine methyltransferases, the positioning of the UAG codon is conserved for homologous genes encoding a particular type of methylamine methyltransferase. Similar to MtmB, the UAG codons in the genes for MttB and MtbB do not appear to cease translation during production of the characterized 50-kDa methyltransferases. This was first suggested from the size of isolated TMA and DMA methyltransferases, which are much larger than would be predicted if the gene ended at the in-frame amber codon. Extension of both these genes beyond the amber codon to the following TAA or TGA codon would produce products of the measured size of the isolated methyltransferases (16Paul L. Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the N- and C-terminal sequences of the isolated DMA methyltransferase confirmed that amber codon read-through must occur during expression of the mtbB genes (16Paul L. Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The sequenced methylamine methyltransferase genes of Methanococcoides burtonii also possess in-frame amber codons, and sequencing of MttB peptides during a proteomic study also indicated that conservation of the reading frame occurs during expression of the TMA methyltransferase gene (23Amber Goodchild A. Saunders N.F. Ertan H. Raftery M. Guilhaus M. Curmi P.M.G. Cavicchioli R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, although it has been largely speculated that the in-frame amber codon of the TMA and DMA methyltransferase genes would also be translated as pyrrolysine, this has never been demonstrated. We have now successfully determined the mass of the UAG-encoded residue in the methylamine methyltransferases, thereby providing the first documentation of pyrrolysine as a naturally occurring protein residue by a method other than crystallography and further that UAG is translated as pyrrolysine in three nonhomologous methylamine methyltransferases. Cell Cultivation and Extracts—M. barkeri MS (DSM800) cells were grown on 80 mm TMA or MMA in a phosphate-buffered medium (24Krzycki J.A. Mortenson L.E. Prince R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7217-7221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 15-40-liter glass carboys with a nitrogen gas phase and harvested 7 days after inoculation. Cell extracts were anaerobically prepared with lysis using a French pressure cell and frozen at -70 °C prior to use. Isolation of Methylamine Methyltransferases—MtmB was purified as the MtmBC complex from cell extracts of M. barkeri MS grown on MMA as previously described for the co-purification of MtbA and MtmC (25Burke S.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4410-4416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that all steps were performed aerobically. In order to separate MtmB from the MtmBC complex, MtmBC was flush-evacuated under hydrogen and then reduced with 5 mm titanium (III)-citrate. The reduced MtmBC complex was then loaded onto an anoxic Sephacryl-S100 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column (80 × 2.5 cm) operated in an anoxic chamber (Coy Laboratories, Grass Lake, MI). MtmB with trace amounts of MtmC eluted near the void volume under these conditions, whereas most of MtmC eluted later in the profile. The procedure was repeated to remove traces of MtmC from MtmB. The MtmB used in these experiments yielded only a single 50-kDa band when subjected to denaturing 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with detection by Coomassie staining. The DMA methyltransferase, MtbB, was isolated entirely in the anoxic chamber. The dimethylamine:CoM methyltransferase assay was performed as described previously (14Ferguson D.J. Gorlatova N. Grahame D.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29053-29060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The buffers and column matrices were made anaerobic before use by repeated cycles of flush/evacuation using N2. The purification was initiated by absorbing 1.5 liters (20 mg of protein/ml) of soluble extract prepared from cells grown on TMA onto a 40 × 5-cm DE-52 (Whatman Inc., Fairfield, NJ) column equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. A gradient (2.4 liters) of 50-500 mm NaCl in the same buffer was applied to the column at 2 ml/min. MtbB eluted in 250 mm NaCl, and the pooled fractions (120 ml) of MtbB1 were concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration with a YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The sample was then diluted with 50 mm MOPS, pH 6.5. An aliquot (35 ml) was then chromatographed with a Mono-Q HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl in 50 mm MOPS, pH 6.5. A 160-ml gradient of 50-500 mm NaCl in the same buffer was applied to the column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The MtbB activity eluted with ∼300 mm NaCl in a total volume of 12 ml. The procedure was repeated with the remaining DE-52 aliquots, and MtbB fractions were pooled and concentrated 10-fold using a YM-10 membrane. The concentrated sample was rediluted 10-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the pooled active fractions were chromatographed on two UNO-Q1 columns (Bio-Rad) that were connected in series and pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. A 160-ml gradient of 150-350 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was applied to the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The MtbB activity eluted at 220 mm NaCl in a volume of 24 ml. The pooled active MtbB fractions from the UNO-Q column were concentrated with a YM-10 membrane and adjusted to 700 mm (NH4)2SO4 with a saturated solution. The sample was then loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose HP cartridge (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 500 mm (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. A gradient (80 ml) of 500 to 0 mm (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, was applied to the column at 0.5 ml/min. The active MtbB eluted at ∼420 mm (NH4)2SO4 in 6 ml. The purified MtbB was concentrated in three Amicon Centricon 10 concentrators to a volume of 1 ml and adjusted to a volume of 4 ml with 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. The sample was homogeneous when 3 μg of protein was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie. The TMA methyltransferase, MttB, was isolated as described previously as the MttB-MttC complex (13Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 846-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Repeated gel permeation chromatography was used to separate MttB from MttC, as described above for MtmB, but using 10 mm dithiothreitol as the reducing agent rather than titanium citrate. Proteolysis—Intact protein was first reduced with dithiothreitol and then carbamidomethylated with iodoacetamide prior to proteolytic digestion using chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science). The final buffer conditions for digestion of desalted samples were 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 5% acetonitrile. The final ratio of methyltransferase to chymotrypsin was 25:1 (w/w) in a total volume of 80 μl. The digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 4 h and stopped by acidification with 1 μl of trifluoroacetic acid. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-MS of the chymotryptic peptides was performed on a Bruker Reflex III (Bruker, Breman, Germany) mass spectrometer operated in reflectron positive ion mode with an N2 laser using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix prepared as a saturated solution in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (in water). Allotments of 5 μl of matrix and 1 μl of sample were thoroughly mixed together, and then 0.5 μl of this mixture was spotted on the target plate and allowed to dry. Surfactant-assisted MALDI (26Breaux G.A. Green-Church K.B. France A. Limbach P.A. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was performed on the digestion products to further increase the number of peptides detected as previously described (26Breaux G.A. Green-Church K.B. France A. Limbach P.A. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—In order to obtain sequence of individual peptide ions, a Micromass Q-TOF II (Micromass, Wythenshawe, UK) equipped with an orthogonal nanospray source (New Objective, Inc., Woburn, MA) was operated in positive ion mode in conjunction with a Dionex Capillary LC-System (LC Packings-A Dionex Co., Sunnyvale, CA). Samples (2.5 μl) were first injected onto a trapping column (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA) and then washed with 50 mm acetic acid and injected onto a 5-cm-long, 75-mm internal diameter ProteoPep II C18 column (New Objective, Inc.) packed directly in the nanospray tip. The column was then eluted with mobile phase A as 50 mm acetic acid and mobile phase B as acetonitrile. Peptides were eluted directly off the column into the Q-TOF system using a gradient of 2-80% B over 45 min with a flow rate of 0.3 μl/min. The total run time was 58 min. The nanospray capillary voltage was set at 3.0 kV, and the cone voltage was set at 55 V. The source temperature was maintained at 100 °C. Mass spectra were recorded using MassLynx 4.0 with automatic switching functions. Mass spectra were acquired from mass 400-2000 daltons every 1 swith a resolution of 8000 (full-width, half-maximum). When the desired peak (using include tables) was detected at a minimum of 15 ion counts, the mass spectrometer automatically switched to acquire a collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS spectrum of the individual peptide. Collision energy was set dependent on charge state recognition properties. The PEAKS program from Bioinformatics Solutions was used for MS/MS data processing. Sequence information from the MS/MS data were processed using Mascot Distiller to form a peaklist file. Data were minimally processed with application of a three-point smoothing function and with the centroid calculated from the top 80% of the peak height. The charge state of each ion selected for MS/MS was calculated; however, the peaks were not deisotoped. Assigned peaks were judged valid only if they had a minimum of 5 counts (S/N of 3) and displayed the corresponding C13 ion. The mass accuracy of the precursor ions was set to 1.2 Da to accommodate accidental selection of the C13 ion, and the fragment mass accuracy was set to 0.3 Da. Considered modifications were methionine oxidation and carbamidomethyl cysteine. Pyrrolysine was also programmed into PEAKS as a modification. The data were acquired several times to ensure reproducibility. MALDI-Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (MALDI-FTICR)—The chymotryptic digestion products of MtmB were mixed 1:1 with 1.3 m 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and air-dried on a MALDI target plate. Ions from 15 laser shots from a Scout intermediate pressure MALDI source were accumulated into an external hexapole ion trap and then transferred into the analyzer cell of a Bruker BioApex 7 Tesla FTICR mass spectrometer. Twelve repetitions of this cycle were co-added for each mass spectrum. The mass spectra were externally calibrated using a bovine serum albumin tryptic digest and then internally calibrated on seven different MtmB chymotryptic peptides, achieving a final mass accuracy of 1.5 ppm. Initial solution phase proteolytic digestions of MtmB were attempted in aqueous buffers containing urea as protein denaturant and employing either chymotrypsin or a combination of GluC and ArgC. These approaches yielded adequate sequence coverage of the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of MtmB but did not yield peptides containing the UAG-encoded residue at position 202 of MtmB. Alternative digestion protocols were therefore developed using acetonitrile, which is highly compatible with mass spectrometry, to denature the protein (27Russell W.K. Park Z.-Y. Russell D.H. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 2682-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Whereas GluC/ArgC digestion of MtmB was inhibited by acetonitrile, organic solvent denaturation enhanced sequence coverage of MtmB with chymotrypsin. The observed m/z of intact peptide assignments identified in MALDI-time of flight MS (see supplemental Table S1), MALDI-FTICR (TABLE ONE), and sequence tags generated from LC-MS/MS (see supplemental Table S2) resulted in a total coverage of 83.4% of the protein (see supplemental Fig. S1). Digestion of MtmB with chymotrypsin in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 5% acetonitrile for 18 h at room temperature allowed reproducible detection by all three methods of a MtmB peptide possessing the pyrrolysyl residue.TABLE ONEPredicted and observed m/z from MALDI-FTICR data acquired on a Bruker MALDI-FTICR mass spectrometer from MtmB digested with chymotrypsinObserved M + HPredicted M + HΔ (predicted - observed)Sequence1223.5481223.5510.0032TFRKSFDCcamY101229.6531229.6540.001294HLDGPVHIRW3031261.6471261.6530.00680THRIVKYTED891445.8511445.847−0.004446GARKKLEDLGLVF4581457.8051457.800−0.005237KIDLDAISVIAHY2491516.8491516.848−0.001162TSVRGKSPIPKSPY1751530.7381530.733−0.00564KAGFEMLLECcamGIY761560.8681560.8740.006445DGARKKLEDLGLVF4581581.8051581.8050.000193AGRPGMoxGVXGPETSL2081648.7141648.710−0.0042TFRKSFDCcamYDFY131802.8551802.852−0.003430DVKTVTPTEEYMQVY4441858.0391858.0430.004162TSVRGKSPIPKSPYEVL178 Open table in a new tab From the crystallographic data, the mass of the pyrrolysyl residue can be calculated as 237.1477 Da (C12H19N3O2), 238.1429 Da (C11H18N4O2), or 239.1269 (C11H17N3O3), depending on the respective identity of the 4-substituent as a methyl, amine, or hydroxy group. The crystal structure obtained for MtmB also revealed that the primary structure of MtmB was that predicted for the gene product of the mtmB1 gene (1Hao B. Gong W. Ferguson T.K. James C.M. Krzycki J.A. Chan M.K. Science. 2002; 296: 1462-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Using these potential masses and the deduced mtmB1 reading frame, a predicted chymotryptic pyrrolysyl-containing peptide (residues 194-208) was observed as either the singly charged ion (M + H) by MALDI or a doubly charged ion (M + 2H) using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. MALDI-FTICR identified an M + H ion with an m/z value of 1581.8036 (n = 6, S.D. = 0.0009) in chymotryptic digests of MtmB. This is within 0.7 ppm of the theoretical mass (1581.8059 Da) of the MtmB peptide 194AGRPGMOXGVXGPETSL208, but only if residue X is pyrrolysyl with the 4-substituent a methyl group. The alternative possibilities would yield masses of 1582.8012 (hydroxyl) and 1583.7852 (amine) for the singly charged ions. The identification of this peptide further allows an estimate of the mass of the pyrrolysyl residue. The theoretical mass of the canonical residues within the peptide (i.e. excluding the UAG-encoded residue) is 1344.6582 Da. This would give the mass of the pyrrolysyl residue as 237.1456 with a mass accuracy of 10 ppm. This mass fits to an empirical formula for pyrrolysine of C12H19N3O2 with an error of 9 ppm. Chymotryptic digests were also analyzed by LC-MS/MS, and peptides identified with high confidence by their sequences are indicated. The doubly charged peptide of 194AGRPGMOXGVXGPETSL208 was detected as a m/z = 791.62+ ion. (The acidic conditions used to produce the electrospray tend to protonate all available basic sites in the peptide, and since this peptide contains an arginine and the N-terminal amine, a doubly charged ion is expected.) The theoretical m/z value is 791.42+ for the sequence 194AGRPGMOXGVXGPETSL208 again, only if X is pyrrolysine with the 4-substituent as a methyl group. The collision-induced dissociation spectrum (CID) of m/z 791.62+ confirmed this sequence assignment (Fig. 3). The y and b ions detected are listed in TABLE TWO. The mass differences"
https://openalex.org/W2067031913,"In vivo studies have shown that the ribosomal large subunit protein L23a (Rpl23ab) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is methylated at lysine residues. However, the gene encoding the methyltransferase responsible for the modification has not been identified. We show here that the yeast YPL208w gene product, a member of the SET domain family of methyltransferases, catalyzes the reaction, and we have now designated it Rkm1 (ribosomal lysine (K) methyltransferase 1). Yeast strains with deletion mutations in candidate SET domain-containing genes were in vivo labeled with S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine. [3H]Methyl radioactivity was determined after lysates were fractionated by SDS gel electrophoresis. When compared with the parent strain or other candidate deletion strains, a loss of a radiolabeled 15-kDa species was observed in the rkm1 (Δypl208w) knock-out strain. Treatment of wild-type cell extracts with RNase or proteinase K demonstrated that the methyl-accepting substrate is a protein. Cellular lysates from parent and knockout strains were fractionated using high salt sucrose gradients. Analysis of the gradient fractions by SDS gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the 15-kDa methyl-accepting substrate elutes with the large ribosomal subunit. In vitro methylation experiments using purified ribosomes confirmed that the methyl-accepting substrate is a ribosomal protein. Amino acid analysis of the in vivo labeled 15 kDa polypeptide showed that it contains ϵ-[3H]dimethyllysine residues. Mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides of the 15 kDa polypeptide identified it as Rpl23ab. Analysis of the intact masses of the large ribosomal subunit proteins by electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed that the substrate is Rpl23ab and that it is specifically dimethylated at two distinct sites by Rkm1. These results show that SET domain methyltransferases can be involved in translational roles as well as in the previously described transcriptional roles.

Methyltransferases containing the SET domain have been shown to post-translationally modify cytochrome c, Rubisco, and histones H3 and H4 at the ϵ-amino groups of lysine side chains (1Aravind L. Iyer L.M. Cell Cycle. 2004; 2: 369-376Google Scholar). The SET domain was first identified in the Drosophila heterochromatin-associated proteins Su(var), Enhancer of zeste, and Trithorax, species later determined to be histone lysine methyltransferases (2Tschiersch B. Hofmann A. Krauss V. Dorn R. Korge G. Reuter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3822-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 3Jones R.S. Gelbart W.M. Mol. Cell.

The SET domain is an S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 3The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; Rkm1, ribosomal lysine(K) methyltransferase 1. 3The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; Rkm1, ribosomal lysine(K) methyltransferase 1. binding domain that does not resemble the canonical seven β-strand AdoMet-binding fold seen in the majority of methyltransferases whose structures are presently known (6Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three SET domain methyltransferases have been identified, two of which are involved in regulating transcription by methylating histone proteins in chromatin and one is the cytochrome c lysine methyltransferase Ctm1p (7Boa S. Coert C. Patterton H.-G. Yeast. 2003; 20: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Roguev A Schaft D Shevchenko A. Pim Pijnappel W.W.M. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F.

Set1 is a histone H3 lysine-4 methyltransferase involved in transcriptional activation, while Set2 is a histone H3 lysine-36 methyltransferase involved in transcriptional repression (7Boa S. Coert C. Patterton H.-G. Yeast. 2003; 20: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Roguev A Schaft D Shevchenko A. Pim Pijnappel W.W.M. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F.

In higher organisms homologous SET domain protein histone methyltransferases have also been identified and their roles have also been linked to both the activation and repression of transcription (11Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Ctm1p was found to specifically trimethylate lysine-72 of iso-1-cytochrome c. The functional role of this modification is not understood (10Polevoda B. Martzen M.R. Das B. Phizicky E.M. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20508-20513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although it has been suggested that the trimethyl group on lysine-72 may aid in abrogating the pro-apoptotic activity of cytochrome c (12Kluck R.M. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Naiem S. Yaffe M.P. Margoliash E. Bredesen D. Mauk A.G. Sherman F. Newmeyer D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16127-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast to the methylation of histones, the methylation of cytochrome c has only been found to occur in plants and fungi and not in higher animals (10Polevoda B. Martzen M.R. Das B. Phizicky E.M.

Chem. 1970; 245: 3325-3327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other cellular processes may also be regulated by methylation, including translation. In a mass spectral analysis of the large ribosomal proteins of S. cerevisiae, it was found that six of the proteins are post-translationally modified by the addition of methyl groups including L1ab, L3, L12ab, L23ab, L42ab, and L43ab (14Lee S.W. Berger S.J. Marinovic S. Pasa-Tolic L. Anderson G.A. Shen Y. Zhao R. Smith R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5942-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The yeast ribosomal protein L23a or YL32 is encoded as identical amino acid sequences by the RPL23a and RPL23b genes and is designated here Rpl23ab. Rpl23ab was shown to be one of the three most highly methylated proteins in the large ribosomal subunit (15Lhoest J. Lobet Y. Costers E. Colson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Lobet Y. Lhoest J. Colson C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), modified in vivo and in vitro by dimethylation at the side chain of one or more lysine residues (15Lhoest J. Lobet Y. Costers E. Colson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The small subunit of the ribosome is also modified by methylation (17Kruiswijk T. Kunst A. Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 175: 221-225Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the physiological roles of ribosomal protein methylation are poorly understood (18Toledo H. Amaro A.M. Sanhueza S. Jerez C.A. Arch. Biol. Med. Exp. 1988; 21: 219-229PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, only two genes have been identified that encode ribosomal protein methyltransferases. In S. cerevisiae, the RMT2 gene encodes an enzyme that monomethylates the δ nitrogen of arginine 67 in the L12 protein of the large subunit (19Chern M.-K. Chang K.-N. Liu L.-F. Tam T.-C.S. Liu Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15345-15353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the protein-arginine methyltransferase 3 homolog (Prmt3) asymmetrically dimethylates an arginine residue in the small ribosomal subunit protein S2 (20Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Deleting the PRMT3 gene resulted in an accumulation of free 60 S subunits (20Bachand F. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The mammalian PRMT3 gene product can also specifically methylate the S2 protein (21Swiercz R. Person M.D. Bedford M.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Biochemical efforts have been made to identify the methyltransferase responsible for modifying Rpl23ab. However, purification to homogeneity was not achieved due largely to the instability of the activity (16Lobet Y. Lhoest J. Colson C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these efforts did lead to the estimation of the native molecular mass of the partially purified enzyme at 82 kDa by size exclusion chromatography and an isoelectric point of 4.45 by isoelectric focusing (16Lobet Y. Lhoest J. Colson C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The genes and proteins for the methyltransferases that modify the remaining ribosomal proteins have not yet been identified. Here we have determined that the gene encoding the Rpl23ab lysine-N-methyltransferase is YPL208w, which we now refer to as RKM1 (ribosomal protein lysine (K) methyltransferase 1). In Vivo Labeling of Potential SET Methyltransferase Mutants with [3H]AdoMet—Yeast strains were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) in which the gene encoding a potential SET methyltransferase was deleted. Genotypes of strains used in this study are described in TABLE ONE. These strains were grown at 30 °C in YPD media (1% bacto-yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% dextrose) to an optical density of 0.7–0.9 at 600 nm. Once the cells reached the desired optical density, 7 A600 nm units of each culture were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed twice with 1 ml of sterile water. The pellet was resuspended in 924 μl of fresh YPD and 76 μl of [3H]AdoMet; Amersham Biosciences, 1 miCi/ml, 70–81 Ci/mmol, in dilute HCl/ethanol (9:1, v/v), pH 2 to 2.5). Cells were labeled for 30 min at 30 °C with shaking, pelleted at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed twice with water, and lysed in 100 μl of 1% SDS and 0.7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysis was performed by vortexing the cells for 1 min in the presence of 0.2 g of baked zirconium beads (Biospec Products; Bartlesville, OK), followed by cooling on ice for 1 min, for a total of 7 cycles. The lysate obtained for each mutant was then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 17,000 × g, both at 4 °C. 10 μlof the resulting lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS gel sample buffer (180 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) and heated at 100 °C for 3 min. Samples were then electrophoresed at 30 mA for 5 h using a Laemmli buffer system (24Laemmli A.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) on a gel prepared with 12.6% acrylamide and 0.43% N,N-methylene-bisacrylamide (unless otherwise stated) (1.5-mm thick, 10.5-cm long resolving gel, 2-cm long stacking gel). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 1 h and destained in 10% methanol and 5% acetic acid overnight. For fluorography, the gels were treated with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h, followed by a 20-min wash in water. Gels were dried at 70 °C for 2 h in vacuo and allowed to cool for 1 h in vacuo. The gels were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR scientific imaging film at –80 °C.TABLE ONEStrains used Strain Genotype Source BY4741 MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 aStrains were purchased from the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (www.sequence.stanford.edu/group/yeast_deletion_project/deletions3.html).

Briefly, 500-ml cultures were grown in YPD to an optical density of 0.5–0.8 at 600 nm, harvested and washed as described above and in vivo labeled for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 152 μl of [3H]AdoMet and 20 ml of fresh YPD medium. The amount of radioactivity used in this label is 20-fold less than the amount used in the in vivo label procedure. After labeling the cells were again harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min, washed twice with water, lysed in 1.5 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) and 1.5 g of baked zirconium beads using the method described above. After lysis, the beads were washed with an additional 1.5 ml of buffer to maximize the yield of lysate. The combined lysate was centrifuged twice at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, followed by one centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. In each case the pellet was discarded. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C using a Beckman type Ti 65 rotor. The ribosomal pellet obtained was resuspended in 500 μl of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl 5 mm magnesium acetate, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) and layered onto a 7–25% sucrose gradient made in the presence of buffer B. The gradients were centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C, using a Beckman type SW41 rotor. Fractions were then collected from the bottom and the A260 nm and A280 nm were measured. Fractions containing either the 60 S or 40 S ribosomal subunits, or cytosolic proteins, were individually pooled and ethanol precipitated by adding 0.7 volumes of cold ethanol in the presence of 15 mm magnesium acetate. The proteins were allowed to precipitate for 24 h at –20 °C. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pelleted proteins were resuspended in 200 μl of water, and the RNA was extracted by the addition of 400 μl of glacial acetic acid and 20 μlof1 m magnesium chloride, in rapid succession. The mixture was stirred for 45 min in an ice bath, after which the precipitated RNA was removed by spinning at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against 2% acetic acid, and lyophilized. The presence of the ribosomal subunits was confirmed by phenol extracting the RNA and determining the content of the 25 S- and 18 S-rRNA species after agarose gel electrophoresis using methods described previously (26Collart M.

Biol. 2004; 251: 323-339PubMed Google Scholar); briefly, the stationary phase used is polymeric (PLRP/S, Polymer Laboratories) and buffers A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) are used for equilibration (95% A; 5% B) and an extended gradient. The mass spectrometer (API III+, PE Sciex) was tuned and calibrated as described (29Whitelegge J.P. Gundersen C. Faull K.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) yielding mass accuracy of 0.01% (±1.5 Da at 15 kDa). Approximately 50% of the column eluent was directed to a fraction collector using a T flow splitter. Fractions were stored at –20 °C for further processing. Purification of Tap-Tagged Rkm1—Tap-tagged Rkm1 (Open Biosystems; Huntsville, AL) was purified by slightly modifying the method used by Puig et al. (30Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 liters of tap-tagged Rkm1-containing cells were grown to 2 OD at an absorbance of 600 nm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min and washed twice with 50 ml of water. The cell pellet was stored at –20 °C overnight. The next day the cells were thawed and lysed in 10 ml of Tap Buffer A (10 mm K-HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) and an equal volume of baked zirconium beads by seven vortexing/icing cycles. After lysis the KCl concentration was adjusted to 0.2 m by adding 1:9 volume of 2 m KCl. The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was recovered. This material was dialyzed against Tap buffer D (20 mm K-HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) for 3 h at 4 °C. Purification with IgG affinity beads (Amersham Biosciences) and cleavage from beads with TEV protease (Invitrogen) was performed as described in Puig et al. (30Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). The TEV protease was then separated from the purified protein using calmodulin-Sepharose 4B chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (30Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). As described in TABLE TWO, the genome of the yeast S. cerevisiae appears to encode at least eleven SET domain-containing proteins. Two of these genes (SET1 and SET2) have been shown to encode histone protein lysine methyltransferases, one gene (SET3) encodes a histone deacetylase, and another gene (CTM1) encodes the cytochrome c lysine methyltransferase (7Boa S.

Open table in a new tab We first compared the methylation of size-fractionated polypeptides derived from parent cells and cells with deletions in the seven SET domain-containing genes. In S. cerevisiae, AdoMet is readily taken up from the external media through a plasma membrane transporter (32Murphy J.T. Spence K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 499-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rouillon A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. J. Biol.

Here, [3H]methyl groups are transferred by the endogenous yeast methyltransferases to their methyl-accepting substrates. When cell extracts were fractionated by SDS gel electrophoresis and analyzed for [3H]methyl groups by autoradiography, a number of radiolabeled species were found (Fig. 1). We detected little or no difference between the parent BY4742 strain and six of the deletion mutants. However, when analyzing the Δypl208w deletion strain, we noted the loss of a 15-kDa radiolabeled species (Fig. 1). It does not appear that the loss of methylation at 15 kDa is caused by the loss of the YPL208w gene product as a methyl-accepting protein because its encoded polypeptide has a mass of 67.2 kDa. We further confirmed these results by analyzing the independently-derived Δypl208w deletion strain obtained in the BY4741 background. Here, we also observed a similar loss of methylation at 15 kDa (Fig. 2). The Δypl208w deletion in both strains was confirmed by PCR analysis (data not shown). These results suggest that the YPL208w gene encodes a methyltransferase active on a 15-kDa species.FIGURE 2Proteinase K and RNase treatment of [3H]AdoMet-labeled cell extracts. In vivo labeled lysate (from 0.35 A600 nm units of cells) was incubated with either 2.4 mg/ml proteinase K for 18 h at 30 °C (lanes 5–8), 0.2 mg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 30 °C (lanes 9–12), or not treated, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C (lanes 13–16). As a control, fresh lysate was loaded without incubation and without treatment (lanes 1–4). Lysates obtained from the wild-type BY4741 and BY4742 strains were analyzed in addition to their respective Δypl208w deletion strains. The reaction mixtures were adjusted to final concentrations of 9.6 mm Tris/HCl, 12 mm NaCl, and 0.24 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of SDS gel sample buffer, electrophoresed, and analyzed by fluorography as described in the legend to Fig. 1 above with a film exposure of 4 days.

https://openalex.org/W2013357048,"Ornithine aminotransferase and 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase are related pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes having different substrate specificities. The atomic structures of these enzymes have shown (i) that active site differences are limited to the steric positions occupied by two tyrosine residues in ornithine aminotransferase and (ii) that, uniquely among related, structurally characterized aminotransferases, the conserved arginine that binds the alpha-carboxylate of alpha-amino acids interacts tightly with a glutamate residue. To determine the contribution of these residues to the specificities of the enzymes, we analyzed site-directed mutants of ornithine aminotransferase by rapid reaction kinetics, x-ray crystallography, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Mutation of one tyrosine (Tyr-85) to isoleucine, as found in aminobutyrate aminotransferase, decreased the rate of the reaction of the enzyme with ornithine 1000-fold and increased that with 4-aminobutyrate 16-fold, indicating that Tyr-85 is a major determinant of specificity toward ornithine. Unexpectedly, the limiting rate of the second half of the reaction, conversion of ketoglutarate to glutamate, was greatly increased, although the kinetics of the reverse reaction were unaffected. A mutant in which the glutamate (Glu-235) that interacts with the conserved arginine was replaced by alanine retained its regiospecificity for the delta-amino group of ornithine, but the glutamate reaction was enhanced 650-fold, whereas only a 5-fold enhancement of the ketoglutarate reaction rate resulted. A model is proposed in which conversion of the enzyme to its pyridoxamine phosphate form disrupts the internal glutamate-arginine interaction, thus enabling ketoglutarate but not glutamate to be a good substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2017609900,"The interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines is a family of structurally and functionally related proteins, including IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). These proteins are also known as gp130 cytokines because they all share gp130 as a common transducer protein within their functional receptor complexes. Several of these cytokines (LIF, OSM, CNTF, and CT-1) also utilize the LIF receptor (LIFR) as a component of their receptor complex. We have shown that all of these cytokines are capable of activating both the JAK/STAT and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By performing a variety of preincubation studies and examining the ability of these cytokines to activate STATs, ERKs, and induce transcription of SOCS-3 mRNA, we have also examined the ability of gp130 cytokines to modulate the action of their family members. Our results indicate that a subset of gp130 cytokines, in particular CT-1, LIF, and OSM, has the ability to impair subsequent signaling activity initiated by gp130 cytokines. However, IL-6 and CNTF do not exhibit this cross-talk ability. Moreover, our results indicate that the cross-talk among gp130 cytokines is mediated by the ability of these cytokines to induce ligand-dependent degradation of the LIFR, in a proteasome-independent manner, which coincides with decreased levels of LIFR at the plasma membrane. In summary, our results demonstrate that an inhibitory cross-talk among specific gp130 cytokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes occurs as a result of specific degradation of LIFR via a lysosome-mediated pathway.

Several gp130 cytokines (LIF, OSM, CNTF, and CT-1) also require the gp130-related protein LIFR (LIF receptor) as a part of their functional receptor complexes (25Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandeBos T.

In fact, these cytokines have very low affinity to gp130 until it becomes a part of the LIFR/gp130 heterodimer. Apart from the shared functional receptor components, IL-6, IL-11, OSM, and CNTF also have cytokine-specific receptor components, often referred to as the α-receptors (30Murakami M. Hibi M.

IL-6 first binds to its α-receptor, IL-6R, and then two of these IL-6·IL-6R complexes associate with gp130 each, allowing the formation of a gp130 homodimer (33Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G.

A similar pattern has also been proposed for the formation of IL-11 functional receptor complexes (31Yin T. Taga T. Tsang M.L. Yasukawa K. Kishimoto T. Yang Y.C. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2555-2561PubMed Google Scholar). OSM can either signal through the LIFR/gp130 heterodimer (26Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K.

Invest. 1995; 96: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Structurally, OSMR is closely related to both LIFR and gp130. However, neither OSMR nor LIFR can bind OSM in the absence of gp130 subunit. The α-receptor for CNTF, CNTFRα, is structurally closely related to extracellular region of IL-6R but is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage. CNTF binds to CNTFRα, followed by the recruitment of gp130 and LIFR by two of these dimers, resulting in a hexameric receptor complex (38De Serio A. Graziani R. Laufer R. Ciliberto G. Paonessa G. J.

The α-receptors for IL-6, IL-11, and CNTF can also be found in a soluble form, and these soluble receptors can bind their ligands in a manner identical to their membrane-associated forms (39Baumann H. Wang Y. Morella K.K. Lai C.F. Dams H. Hilton D.J. Hawley R.G. Mackiewicz A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 284-290PubMed Google Scholar, 40Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). These soluble receptors have the potential to confer cytokine responsiveness to cells expressing gp130 and LIFR that do not express membrane-associated forms of the α-receptors (41Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 42Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Ip N.Y. Stahl N. Scherer S. Farruggella T. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Panayotatos N. Gascan H. Science. 1993; 259: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).The ubiquitous expression of gp130 in every cell type examined explains the pleiotropic nature of gp130 cytokine action, whereas shared usage of gp130 by all these cytokines in part explains the redundancy of their actions. Unlike gp130, LIFR and the specific α-receptors exhibit a more tissue-specific expression (43Saito M. Yoshida K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4066-4071PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore contribute to the specificity of gp130 cytokine actions. Spatial and temporal expression of the individual cytokines is another factor that contributes to the specificity of their actions (44Hirota H. Kiyama H. Kishimoto T. Taga T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2627-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Functionally, it is the formation of the gp130/gp130 homodimer or the LIFR/gp130 heterodimer that is essential for the downstream signal transduction of gp130 cytokines. The function of the α-receptor is to recruit the ligand and aid in the formation of signal-transducing dimers in response to the ligands that are themselves incapable of doing so. After stimulation by gp130 cytokines, target cells undergo a wide variety of fates: growth promotion, growth arrest, differentiation, or the expression of specific genes. The specificity of cytokine actions in a given cell type arises not only from the differences in the receptor and cytokine expression, but also from the differences in downstream signaling pathways activated by the cytokine.Upon stimulation by gp130 cytokines, the gp130 receptor itself undergoes homo- or heterodimerization governed by the phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic region of the protein. This dimerization triggers the activation of cytoplasmic protein kinases associated with gp130 receptor. In the case of gp130, those kinases are JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 (45Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M.

Activated JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the distal part of gp130 and LIFR and provide docking sites for Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins such as STATs. Even though the STAT family consists of 7 members, it is generally recognized that gp130 cytokines activate STAT 3 and, to a lesser extent, STAT 1 (51Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 52Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). Once recruited to the receptor, STATs are phosphorylated and form dimers that translocate to the nucleus, bind DNA, and modulate transcription. Stimulation by gp130 cytokines can also lead to the activation of the p42/44 MAPK pathway (53Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recent studies have shown that three different gp130 cytokines activate both the JAK/STAT and p42/44 MAPK signaling pathways in fat cells (54Zvonic S.

Because these cytokines utilize many of the same signaling proteins, we examined the cross-talk among LIF, CT-1, OSM, CNTF, and IL-6 in adipocytes. We also examined the ability of growth hormone (GH), a potent STAT activator, to modulate gp130 cytokine signaling. Our results demonstrate that a 2-h pretreatment with the gp130 cytokines examined leads to the inhibition of their own subsequent signaling. Interestingly, LIF could also inhibit the signaling of CT-1, CNTF, and OSM, but not IL-6. Similarly, CT-1 could inhibit its own signaling or a cellular response to LIF and OSM. OSM also exhibited similar properties. Inhibition of signaling was measured by three parameters: activation of STATs, activation of ERKs, and the induction of SOCS-3 mRNA. Moreover, we observed that the cross-talk that resulted in an inhibition of signaling correlated with the degradation of the LIFR in a proteasome-independent manner and a loss of the LIFR at the plasma membrane. In summary, our findings strongly suggest that inhibitory cross-talk among specific gp130 cytokines in fat cells is mediated by the ligand-dependent lysosome-mediated degradation of the LIFR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Invitrogen.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probes were labeled by random priming using the Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dATP.Rodent Adipose Tissue Isolation—Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and tissues were immediately removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were homogenized in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 50 trypsin inhibitory milliunits of aprotinin, and 10 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm sodium vanadate. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 rpm to remove any debris and insoluble material and then analyzed for protein content. All C57BL/6J mice were obtained from a colony at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. All animal studies were carried out with protocols that were reviewed and approved by institutional IACUCs.3T3-L1 Cell Membrane Fractionation—Untreated and LIF-treated serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes were rinsed with buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) at 37 °C and then harvested at 4 °C in buffer A and homogenized with a Teflon pestle. Total membranes were pelleted at 250,000 × g for 90 min and resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). For some experiments, membranes were fractionated into plasma membrane, intracellular membranes (low density microsomes, LDM), and a nuclear/mitochondrial fraction as we have described previously (59Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane and cytosolic fractions were divided and immediately stored at –70 °C. The protein content for all fractions was determined with a BCA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSOne of the unifying features of all gp130 cytokines is their ability to activate JAK/STAT and MAPK (ERK1/2) signaling pathways. We therefore wanted to determine whether gp130 cytokines, which affect these pathways in fat cells, can work synergistically to initiate these signals, or whether their actions antagonize each other. To address this question, we pretreated fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with several different gp130 cytokines (IL-6, LIF, OSM, CNTF, and CT-1), as well as with GH for 2 h. Next, we treated the cells for 15 min with either CT-1, CNTF, LIF, or GH. As shown in Fig. 1, gp130 cytokines interacted primarily in an antagonistic fashion. The results in Fig. 1A represent an experiment in which 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with CT-1, which is known to activate STAT 1 and 3 in these cells potently (60Zvonic S. Hogan J.C. Arbour-Reily P. Mynatt R.L. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47572-47579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We observed that CT-1 signaling was impaired by a 2-h pretreatment with several gp130 cytokines, including CT-1. Our results demonstrate that a 2-h pretreatment with LIF, OSM, or CT-1 completely blocked the STAT 1 activation induced by a 15-min CT-1 treatment. These same cytokines also interfered with the activation of STAT 3 by CT-1. In this case, LIF acted as the most potent inhibitor, whereas CT-1 and OSM pretreatments consistently resulted in a partial, but significant, inhibition of STAT activation. No substantial STAT 5 activation occurred with CT-1 treatment, whereas GH pretreatment caused a robust STAT 5 activation that was detectable even after the 2-h pretreatment period. The ability of LIF, OSM, and CT-1 to block further actions of CT-1 was also evident through their effects on MAPK (ERK1/2) signaling because the activation of this pathway by acute CT-1 was attenuated through pretreatment with these cytokines.Even though CNTF is not a potent activator of JAK/STAT or MAPK signaling in adipocytes (54Zvonic S. Cornelius P. Stewart W.C. Mynatt R.L. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2228-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 60Zvonic S. Hogan J.C. Arbour-Reily P. Mynatt R.L. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47572-47579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), its ability to activate STAT 3 (first lane, Fig. 1B) was affected by the pretreatment with all other gp130 cytokines examined, except for IL-6. As was the case with the acute CT-1 treatment, a 2-h pretreatment of adipocytes with LIF, OSM, or CT-1 decreased the magnitude of STAT 3 activation by CNTF. This pattern of regulation was not observed with active MAPK, which we attribute to the weak activation of this kinase by CNTF.The data in Fig. 1C verify that LIF acts as a potent activator of JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, the ability of LIF to activate STAT 1 and 5 was completely abolished by a 2-h pretreatment with LIF, OSM, or CT-1. An identical pattern of inhibition was also observed with the activation of MAPK (ERK1/2) by a 15-min LIF treatment. Acute LIF administration resulted in a robust STAT 3 activation, and only the 2-h pretreatment with LIF resulted in an attenuation of STAT 3 activation. Hence, the gp130 cytokines LIF, OSM, and CT-1 pretreatment inhibited the LIF-induced activation of STAT 1 and 5, but not of STAT 3.Acute treatment with GH, shown in Fig. 1D, also leads to a robust induction of JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling, as evident by the activation of STAT 1, 3, and 5 and ERK1/2. However, unlike gp130 cytokines, the ability of GH to activate these pathways was not affected by a 2-h preincubation with any of the gp130 cytokines examined. In fact, LIF, OSM, and CT-1 mildly enhanced the GH-induced activation of STAT 3, but not of STAT 1 and 5. The only inhibitory effect observed for GH singling was the inhibition of STAT and MAPK activation after a 2-h pretreatment with GH itself. STAT5A levels are shown in all panels of Fig. 1 to demonstrate equivalent loading of whole cell extracts. The expression of STAT 3 and total level of ERK1/2 (MAPK) also remained unchanged by all of the treatments shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown).We utilized a similar experimental approach in an in vivo model to examine further the nature of interactions among gp130 cytokines. C57BL/6J mice were injected with either 0.05 nm CT-1 or the appropriate vehicle (saline) control, then injected again either four (Fig. 2A) or eight (Fig. 2B) h later, and then sacrificed 15 min after the second round of injections. As shown in Fig. 2, acute intraperitoneal administration of CT-1 lead to the activation of STAT 3 in mouse epididymal fat pads. Interestingly, MAPK (ERK1/2) was active even in animals injected with vehicle (saline) control. As expected, phosphorylated STAT 3 proteins were present in the adipose tissue extracts from mice after a 15-min injection with CT-1. We still observed active STAT 3 at 4 h after CT-1 administration (Fig. 2A) at levels comparable with that following a 15-min treatment. In an independent experiment, six animals were pretreated with CT-1 after an intraperitoneal injection with CT-1 or vehicle, and epididymal fat pads were harvested for analysis. We observed that the active forms of both STAT 3 and MAPK were absent from the fat pads 8 h after a CT-1 injection (Fig. 2B). The animals injected with CT-1 for 4 h, and then again for 15 min (Fig. 2A), showed no additional increase in STAT 3 or MAPK activation compared with animals injected with CT-1 for 15 min or 4 h only. Yet, in the fat pads of mice injected with CT-1 for 8 h, and then again for 15 min (Fig. 2B), we observed no increase in STAT 3 or MAPK activation compared with animals injected with CT"

Light provides to photosynthetic organisms the energy for life and, thus, is a key environmental factor. However, it may also produce important damages when the incoming flux of excitation energy over-whelms the metabolic capacities of the cells. A variety of cellular and molecular responses exist that allow the organisms, among which are cyanobacteria, to cope with and adapt to changes in the intensity and/or spectral quality of light (1Tandeau de Marsac N.

Extensive research efforts have focused on the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that regulate acclimation and adaptation of photosynthetic organisms to high light and UV radiations. The latter, through UV-B-generated radicals in particular, have a number of negative impacts on cell physiology, damaging nucleic acids, proteins, and/or lipids (3Unsal-Kacmaz K.A. Makhov M.

The ensuing degradation of the D1 and D2 proteins, which compose the heart of the PSII reaction center, leads to an inhibition of the PSII activity (19Vass I. Kirilovsky D. Etienne A.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12786-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Among the strategies developed to cope with UV-B, cyanobacteria increase their de novo synthesis of the D1 and D2 subunits to repair PSII (20Sass L. Spetea C. Maté Z. Nagy F. Vass I. Photosynth.

To adapt to new conditions, cells must first perceive the environmental signals and then transduce them to the response apparatus so as to modify their metabolism accordingly. Second messengers such as cyclic nucleotides (cNMPs) play key roles in the transduction steps (22Trewavas A.J. Rodrigues C. Rato C. Malho R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes that, like eukaryotes, possess both cAMP and cGMP, their precise role being, however, poorly documented at present (23Cann M.J. New Phytol. 2003; 161: 23-34Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Ohmori M. Okamoto S. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Information has been obtained from different strains, and currently only an incomplete picture of the role of cNMPs is available. For Spirulina cells, which excrete cAMP under standard growth conditions, cAMP stimulates respiration and gliding motility and triggers mat formation (24Ohmori M. Okamoto S. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In Anabaena flos-aquae, the extracellular cAMP concentration was shown to be 10-fold higher in stationary than in exponential phase (25Francko D. Wetzel R.G. J. Phycol. 1981; 17: 129-134Crossref Google Scholar). In Anabaena cylindrica, light-off and light-on signals modulate the intracellular cAMP concentration (26Ohmori M. Terauchi K. Okamoto S. Watanabe M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 75: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). cAMP-mediated photosignaling through phytochrome-like proteins has now been demonstrated in Anabaena PCC 7120 (27Okamoto S. Kasahara M. Kamiya A. Nakahira Y. Ohmori M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2004; 80: 429-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to what happens in A. cylindrica, the cellular cAMP concentration increases upon a shift from dark to light, especially blue light, in Synechocystis PCC 6803 (24Ohmori M. Okamoto S.

We also know that in that strain, both cAMP and its receptor protein (Sycrp1) are required for motility.

Finally, in that same strain the cGMP concentration increases when cells are grown photoheterotrophically and starved for nitrogen (31Elmorjani K Herdman M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 133: 1685-1694Google Scholar). Cyclic nucleotide homeostasis requires both cyclases to achieve their synthesis from ATP or GTP and phosphodiesterases for their degradation to AMP or GMP. By complementation of Escherichia coli cya mutants, a few cyanobacterial genes coding for adenylyl cyclases have been cloned (32Katayama M. Ohmori M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3588-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent availability of complete genome sequences for 13 cyanobacterial strains has revealed that many putative adenylyl cyclases may exist within a single species, with at least 6 present in Anabaena/Nostoc PCC 7120 (33Ohmori M. Ikeuchi M. Sato N. Wolk P. Kaneko T. Ogawa T. Kanehisa M. Goto S. Kawashima S. Okamoto S. Yoshimura H. Katoh H. Fujisawa T. Ehira S. Kamei A. Yoshihara S. Narikawa R. Tabata S.

Both an adenylyl and a putative guanylyl cyclase have been described for Synechocystis PCC 6803 (29Terauchi K. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Ochoa de Alda J.A.G. Ajlani G. Houmard J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3839-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although phosphodiesterase enzymatic activities have been measured for cAMP degradation in a few species (35Sakamoto T. Murata N. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 581-584Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), no orthologue of bacterial-type phosphodiesterases could, however, be recognized by in silico approaches in Synechocystis PCC 6803 (36Ochoa de Alda J.A.G. Houmard J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 3183-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Two Synechocystis PCC 6803 open reading frames (slr2100 and sll1624) carry a so-called HD (or phosphohydrolase) domain. Belonging to the HD protein family, they were proposed to be putative cNMP phosphodiesterases (36Ochoa de Alda J.A.G. Houmard J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 3183-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The questions we addressed were: do these molecules regulate the intracellular level of cAMP and/or cGMP, and what is their in vivo function? To get an answer, the two genes were inactivated, and the phenotype of the corresponding mutants was studied. Under steady-state standard conditions, both grow at a rate similar to that of the wild type strain. However, the slr2100 mutant contains slightly lesser amounts of the photosynthetic apparatus components and higher amounts of cGMP and is more sensitive to a UV-B stress than the wild type. We found that it is impaired in its ability to repair the damaged PSIIs under UV-B radiation. Altogether, the data show that cGMP could play an important role in the adaptation, regulation, and functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus in Synechocystis PCC 6803. Strains and Growth Conditions—Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was obtained from the Pasteur Culture Collection. Liquid cultures were routinely grown photoautotrophically at 30 °C under white light (30 μmol of photon·m-2·s-1, cool-white Philips fluorescent tubes) in BG11 medium (37Rippka R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10 mm NaHCO3 and buffered with 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, under a 1% (v/v) CO2-enriched atmosphere in an illuminated rotatory shaker (120 rpm). For growth on plates, 1% of separately autoclaved agar was added. Whenever appropriate, antibiotics (spectinomycin (30 μg·ml-1), kanamycin (75 μg·ml-1), or chloramphenicol (7 μg·ml-1)) were added to the plates. Cyanobacterial growth was followed by recording optical densities at 750 nm. Cyanobacterial cell mass was estimated by measuring the Chla concentration of the cultures. Chla was determined in 90% acetone extracts (38Porra R.J. Grimme L.H. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 57: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or using the Chlorophyll 1.03 program (bilbo.bio.purdue.edu/www-cyanosite/protocols/chl103.html). Whole cell spectra were recorded from 400 to 750 nm with an Aminco DW-2 spectrophotometer. The E. coli strain routinely used as host, DH5α, was grown at 37 °C in Luria broth medium with appropriate antibiotics whenever necessary (ampicillin and/or chloramphenicol at 50 or 30 μg·ml-1, respectively). UV-B Treatment—UV-B irradiation was performed at 30 °C in open, rectangular glass containers in which 11-mm-height layers of cells were maintained in suspension by magnetic agitation. UV-B light was provided by a Vilbert-Lourmat VL-215M lamp in combination with a 0.1-mm cellulose acetate filter (Clarfoil, Courtaluds Chemicals, UK), yielding an intensity of 6 μmol of photons·m-2·s-1 at the surface of the samples. Incident wavelengths range from 290 to 340 nm, with a maximum at 312 nm. Cells were used at a concentration of 6.5 μg Chla·ml-1. Oxygen Evolution Measurements—Steady-state rates of oxygen evolution were measured using a Hansatech DW2 O2 electrode at a light intensity of 1000 μmol of photons·m-2·s-1 of photosynthetically active radiation (400–700 nm) in the presence of 0.5 mm 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone as electron acceptor. Light was provided by a Halogen-Bellaphot (12 V, 100 watts, Osram, Germany) lamp. Typically, 2 ml of cells at 6.5 μg of Chla·ml-1 were used in each measurement. Results are expressed in relative value, 100% as the steady-state oxygen evolution at time 0. Fluorescence Relaxation Decay—Flash-induced increase and subsequent decay of chlorophyll fluorescence yield was measured with the P.S.I. double-modulated fluorometer FL-100 (P.S.I., Brno, Czech Republic) and was performed in the 150 μs to 100 s range as described (19Vass I. Kirilovsky D. Etienne A.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12786-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions—Standard cloning procedures were used according to Sambrook et al. (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 2680-bp DNA fragment containing the entire slr2100 (rre20) open reading frame and two flanking regions (704 bp upstream and 870 bp downstream, i.e. from nucleotides 1567613 to 1570293 in Cyanobase; www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using two specific primers that were designed from the sequences available in Cyanobase (TABLE ONE). For oriented cloning into pBluescriptSK+, BamHI and PstI restriction sites were added at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the sequence, respectively. The PCR product was obtained using 0.1 μg of purified Synechocystis genomic DNA after 35 cycles of amplification with the Expand High Fidelity system (Roche Applied Science), with cycles set up as 94 °C (30 s), 63 °C (30 s), and 68 °C (3 min). The PCR fragment was digested by BamHI and PstI and cloned into a pBluescript SK+vector (Stratagene) digested by the same enzymes, producing pSlr2100. A similar protocol was used to construct pSll1624, the BamHI-PstI insert (2427 bp) containing the entire sll1624 (rre18) open reading frame and two flanking regions (782 bp upstream and 640 bp downstream, i.e. from nucleotides 1320195 to 1322621 in Cyanobase).TABLE ONEOligonucleotides used for mutant constructions Restriction sites used for cloning are in bold, and non-cyanobacterial sequences are underlined.2100Fw15′-cgggatcccatgctctgacat-3′2100-Rev15′-tttctgcaggactaacctccgcccctt-3′1624-Fw5′-gggatcctgccctaatccagagcaa-3′1624-Rev5′-tttctgcagaagggttgcatatccaca-3′Del2100-Fw5′-tttcccgggtgagtatgtatagctaattcaatc-3′Del2100-Rev5′-tttcccgggtggccatggcgtattaaagaa-3′Flank1624-Rev5′-tcccccgggggactgggtgaaaagtagtca-3′Flank1624-Fw5′-tcccccgggccaaattgacgtccatcaaca-3′ Open table in a new tab The pΔSlr2100 derivative was constructed by substituting the entire slr2100-coding sequence with the Ω cassette (aadA gene), which confers resistance to both spectinomycin and streptomycin. The slr2100-coding region was removed by performing a reverse PCR on pSlr2100 using primers specific for the slr2100-flanking regions Del2100-Fw and Del2100-Rev and the above-described protocol. Both primers were designed to generate a XmaI site at the extremity of the PCR product site used to insert the Ω cassette (2-kilobase-long XmaI fragment from pHP45) after dephosphorylation with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The pΔSll1624 derivative was constructed by substituting the entire sll1624-coding sequence with the cassette from pUC4K, which confers resistance to kanamycin. The two flanking sequences were prepared by PCR and ligated after restriction by SmaI to pBluescript SK+. Then the kanamycin cassette was inserted into the SmaI site. Construction of the Synechocystis Mutants—Wild type Synechocystis PCC 6803 cells were transformed separately with plasmids pΔSlr2100 and pΔSll1624, which do not replicate in the cyanobacterium, according to Golden et al. (40Golden S. Brusslan J. Haselkorn R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 48 h on nitrocellulose filters (Nuclepore REC-85) without any selection, and the transformants were selected after transfer to antibiotic-containing BG11 plates. Cells were repeatedly subcultured until full segregation of the mutation was obtained. Total segregation was ascertained by PCRs performed using the flanking region oligonucleotides. cNMP Determination—Cells (100 ml) between 6 and 6.5 μg of Chla·ml-1 were harvested by filtration under vacuum on glass fiber prefilters (Millipore: APF B04700). Filters were immediately transferred to a tube containing 10 ml of 1 mm NaH2PO4 buffer at pH 6.5 preheated at 100 °C. After 5 min at 100 °C, a known volume of the filtrate was filtered through a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) before transfer to a Vivaspin Mr 50,000 column (Vivascience) and centrifugation for 30 min at 5000 × g. An aliquot of the eluate was freeze-dried, and the lyophilisate was resuspended in 600 μl of 30 mm, pH 6.5, of NaH2PO4 buffer. After centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g, 100 μl were injected onto a high performance liquid chromatography XTerra rp18 (3.5-μm 4.6 × 150 column, Waters) equipped with a 20-mm-long precolumn. The column was developed at a flow rate of 0.8 ml·min-1 with solvent A (30 nm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5) and solvent B (acetonitrile/H2O (99:1, v/v). Quantification was achieved by calibrating the system with precisely known quantities of the different cyclic nucleotides. Thylakoid Preparation and Protein Analyses—Thylakoid membranes were prepared by breakage of the cells with glass beads (150–200 μm in diameter) at 4 °C followed by differential centrifugations according to Komenda et al. (41Komenda J. Lupinkova L. Kopecky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein composition was assessed by electrophoresis in a denaturing 12–20% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel containing 6 m urea. After solubilization (41Komenda J. Lupinkova L. Kopecky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), thylakoid extracts adjusted at 0.7 μg of Chla per lane were loaded, and the gel was run overnight at 18 °C. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm, Schleicher and Schuell) by wet blotting. The membrane was incubated with an antibody raised against the C terminus of pea D1 protein (a kind gift of P. Nixon) and then with secondary antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by colorimetric reaction using a BCPIP-NBT system. Membranes were scanned, and the bands were quantified using the ImageJ program (a public domain image processing and analysis program provided by the National Institutes of Health). Macroarray and Quantitative PCR—Total RNAs were isolated by the hot-phenol method adapted from Mohamed and Jansson (42Mohamed A. Jansson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen, 1 unit/μg of RNA) according to the manufacturer's instructions before use. The absence of DNA products from these RNA preparations in standard PCR assays was checked to ascertain the removal of any DNA contaminants. Probes for the macroarray analyses were prepared as follows. RNA was reverse-transcribed with a set of hexanucleotides (CGATCG, GGCGAT, CAAAAT, CAATGG, GGCAAT, AAATCC, CTTTTT, ACCAAT, GGCCAC, AAAACC, CCAGCA) kindly designed by Anne Morgat (INRIA Rhône-Alpes, France) so as to prime all of the 400 genes loaded on the nylon membrane while minimizing transcription from the rRNAs. The labeling reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 1 μg of RNA, 5 pmol of each primer, 0.5 mm dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 5 μm dATP, 40 μCi of α-[32P]dATP, 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, and 20 units of RNasOUT in 1× manufacturer's reaction buffer (Invitrogen). RNA and primers in RNase-free H2O were first incubated at 55 °C for 15 min and cooled down. The reaction mix containing [α-32P]dATP was then added, and incubation was done for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of 1 mm dATP (final concentration) followed by a further 15 min of incubation at 37 °C. RNase (2 μg) was added, and after 30 min at 37 °C probes were purified using the QIA-quick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Hybridizations were performed overnight at 65 °C. Membranes were then washed as follows: 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) for 5 min at room temperature, 1% SDS in 2× SSC for 30 min at 60 °C, and 1% SDS in 0.1× SSC for 30 min at room temperature. Quantifications of the RNA levels were performed with a Fuji Fla3000 reader. For quantitative PCRs, primers were designed using the LightCycler software (Roche Applied Science) so as to get products with size about 150-bp long with a Tm of 60 °C. The cDNA synthesis was achieved in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1 μg of RNA, 2 pmol of the primers for each of the genes to be further amplified, 0.5 mm concentrations of each dNTP, 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, and 20 units of RNasOUT in 1× manufacturer's reaction buffer (Invitrogen). Real-time PCRs were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the QuantiTect SYBR Green kit (Qiagen) and a Roche LightCycler system on 0.4 μl of the cDNA solution prepared above. Amplifications were done by incubating the reaction mixtures at 95 °C for 30 s before 45 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C (melting), 30 s at 60 °C (annealing), and 30 s at 72 °C (extension). At the end of the runs, a melting curve was generated and analyzed to ascertain that the recorded data correspond to only one PCR product of expected Tm. The relative abundance of each transcript was determined by comparison of the threshold cycle values (CT) recorded by the apparatus for the different genes to that for the rnpB product. The ratio of expression (R) of the gene of interest (goi) to rnpB was calculated using the simple equation: Rgoi/rnpB = 2(CTrnpB - CTgoi). Targeted substitution of the sll1624 and slr2100 genes by the antibiotic resistance cassettes was achieved by transforming wild type Synechocystis PCC 6803 cells with the non-replicative plasmid pΔSll1624 and pΔSlr2100, respectively. Full segregation was easily obtained for the two mutations and ascertained by Southern blot experiments using slr2100, sll1624, and antibiotic resistance genes as hybridizing probes (data not shown). Under standard conditions, no significant differences in terms of growth rate could be observed between the null mutants (gene deletions) and wild type strain, with doubling times ∼14 h at 30 °C and 30 μmol of photon·m-2·s-1. Pigment Composition—Because of an apparent color difference between cultures, whole cell absorption spectra were recorded (Fig. 1A). The phycocyanin over chlorophyll ratio (PC/Chl) was consistently 10% lower for the slr2100 mutant (1.01 ± 0.004) compared with the sll1624 and wild type strains (1.12 ± 0.013 and 1.09 ± 0.007, respectively). No significant difference was, however, observed in the carotenoid absorption bands under standard growth conditions, and the three strains exhibit similar rates of oxygen evolution. Effect of the Light Regime on Oxygen Evolution—Transfer of wild type Synechocystis PCC 6803 cells from a moderate photon flux density (30 μmol of photon·m-2·s-1) to >300 μmol of photon·m-2·s-1 produces photoinhibition. Oxygen evolution is then reduced as a consequence of partial PSII inactivation. The two mutants behave similarly to the wild type upon a shift to 1500 μmol of photon·m-2·s-1 (only slr2100 is shown, Fig. 1B). In contrast, differences were observed in the response to a UV-B stress. After a 2-h exposure to UV-B (at an intensity in the range found in natural environments), oxygen evolution decreased by ∼29% for the wild type and ∼40% for slr2100 (Fig. 2A). The sll1624 mutant, however, does not differ from the wild type (Fig. 2B). To determine the origin of this increased sensitivity of the slr2100 mutant to UV-B radiation, the same experiment was repeated in the presence of lincomycin, a translation inhibitor. For the wild type the relative decrease in O2 evolution was much larger in the presence of lincomycin (50 versus 29%) than for the slr2100 mutant (55 versus 40%). The impairment of O2 evolution for the wild type in the presence of lincomycin resembles that observed for slr2100 without the inhibitor. The simplest explanation is that the mutation has an effect on the cascade of events required for the repair of the damaged PSII centers, which is known to require de novo protein synthesis (43Aro E.M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Upon transfer back to medium intensity visible light (50 μmol·m-2·s-1) after the 2-h UV exposure, both wild type and mutant strains recover the same level of O2 evolution (90–100% of the initial value within 1 h). PSII inactivation is, thus, fully reversible for the two strains (Fig. 2A). Effect of UV-B on Fluorescence Relaxation—To ascertain the previous results, the relaxation of the fluorescence induced by a saturating flash delivered to dark-adapted cells in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea was monitored for both the wild type and slr2100 strains. Recordings were made with cells sampled before the treatment, 2 h after the UV-B exposure, and after 1 h of recovery under white light conditions (Fig. 3A). As previously described (19Vass I. Kirilovsky D. Etienne A.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12786-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), sigmoidal type curves are obtained when the fluorescence intensity was plotted against the log of the time. This decay was assigned to the back recombination of QA- with the S2 state of the water oxidation complex. Such experiments, thus, give information on the functional integrity of the redox components on the donor side of PSII. The half-life for relaxation is 0.6 s for the two strains when grown under standard conditions (Fig. 3A). After 2 h of a UV-B treatment, the decay was faster for the wild type (half-life, 0.4 s), indicating that QA- cannot recombine with the S2 state in part of the centers and exchanges with redox components closer to QA- like the redox-active tyrosine (Tyr-Z) (19Vass I. Kirilovsky D. Etienne A.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12786-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 44Tichy M. Lupinkova L. Sicora C. Vass I. Kuvikova S. Prasil O. Komenda J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1605: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The difference was even more pronounced for the slr2100 mutant (half-life, 0.3 s). This result indicates that the manganese cluster of the PSII centers was more damaged by the UV-B treatment in the mutant than in the wild type. After the recovery phase, the fluorescence relaxation profiles are similar for both strains (Fig. 3C), confirming that the mutation likely affects the PSII repair process that takes place during the UV-B exposure.

Most patients have a defect in the cystathionine-β-synthase, the key enzyme in the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine. Many abnormalities in the connective tissue of patients with homocystinuria resemble those seen in Marfan syndrome, caused by mutations in fibrillin-1. These observations led to the hypothesis that the structure and function of fibrillin-1 is compromised in patients with homocystinuria. To test this hypothesis we produced recombinant human fibrillin-1 fragments spanning the central portion of the molecule (8-Cys/transforming growth factor-β binding domain 3 to calcium binding EGF domain 22) and extensively analyzed the potential of homocysteine to modify structural and functional properties of these proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed moderate changes of their secondary structures after incubation with homocysteine. Equilibrium dialysis demonstrated a number of high affinity calcium binding sites in the tandemly repeated calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like domains 11-22. Calcium binding of homocysteine-modified fragments was completely abolished. Incubation of the recombinant proteins with homocysteine rendered the analyzed calcium binding EGF domains as well as the 8-Cys/transforming growth factor-β binding domain 3 significantly more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Furthermore, data were obtained demonstrating that homocysteine can covalently modify fibrillin-1 via disulfide bonds. These data strongly suggest that structural and functional modifications as well as degradation processes of fibrillin-1 in the connective tissues of patients with homocystinuria play a major role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.

The spectrum of physiological functions of microfibrils is versatile. It is believed that they serve as a scaffold for the deposition of elastin and, thus, for the correct formation of the elastic fibers (4Mecham R.P. Davis E. Yurchenco P.D. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., New York1994: 281-314Google Scholar). In the eye microfibrils are the major component of the ciliary zonules holding the lens in the correct position. Microfibrils are also suggested to play a role in the regulation of morphogenic substances like transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) through the interaction of fibrillin-1 with latent TGF-β-binding proteins (5Isogai Z.

Fibrillins display a pronounced modular protein design characterized by an unusual high (12-13%) overall content of cysteine residues.

Calcium binding to cbEGF domains is mediated by the consensus sequence (D/N)X(D/N)(E/Q)Xm(D/N)Xn (Y/F) in the N-terminal part of the domain (9Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron M. Winship P.R.

In contrast to isolated cbEGF domains with dissociation constants in the millimolar range, the affinity for calcium of tandemly repeated cbEGF domains is typically higher (∼0.35-500 μm), indicating a stabilizing effect of the surrounding domains (18Handford P.A.

The calcium concentration in extracellular environments is predicted to be about 1-2 mm. High affinity calcium binding sites are, thus, expected to be fully saturated, whereas low affinity binding sites are likely only partially saturated, which may be important for the regulation of flexibility, elastic properties, degradation, and/or protein-protein interactions.Mutations in fibrillin-1 lead to the autosomal dominant disorder Marfan syndrome (MIM 154700), which is characterized by symptoms in the cardiovascular, the skeletal, and the ocular systems (24Pyeritz R.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2000; 51: 481-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Most currently known mutations (72%) leading to Marfan syndrome are point mutations, and about 35% of all mutations generate or substitute cysteine residues (25Collod-Beroud G. Le Bourdelles S.

Mutat. 2002; 20: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Homocystinuria (MIM 236200) is an autosomal recessive disorder originating from enzymatic defects of the methionine metabolism. The major cause of homocystinuria is a deficiency in the cystathionine-β-synthase, an enzyme involved in the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine (27Skovby F. Kraus J.P. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2002: 627-650Google Scholar). This deficiency leads to significantly elevated plasma concentrations of the toxic amino acid homocysteine of up to 500 μm compared with 10 μm under normal conditions (28Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Brattstrom L. Francis R.B.J. Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, Hemostasis, and Endothelial Function. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1992: 183-236Google Scholar, 29Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Nygard O. Vollset S.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 31-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). The most prominent clinical symptoms of patients with homocystinuria are mental retardation, ectopia lentis, skeletal abnormalities, and vascular disease (27Skovby F. Kraus J.P. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2002: 627-650Google Scholar). The skeletal and ocular symptoms resemble the symptoms seen in patients with Marfan syndrome, and in both disorders histopathological findings included fragmented elastic fibers in the aortic wall (27Skovby F. Kraus J.P. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2002: 627-650Google Scholar, 30Pyeritz R. Dietz H. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York2002: 585-626Google Scholar). Although the genetic cause for homocystinuria has been determined, it is not clear how elevated levels of homocysteine lead to the pathogenetic mechanisms. We and others hypothesized that due to the reductive potential of homocysteine, it may be able to chemically modify the structure of the heavily disulfide-bonded fibrillin-1 and, thus, alter its functional properties.Only a few studies addressed the molecular consequences of elevated homocysteine levels on extracellular matrix proteins including fibrillins. In a high methionine diet chick model with elevated homocysteine levels, the amounts of fibrillin-2 and elastin-associated microfibrils in the aortic wall were reduced (31Hill C.H. Mecham R. Starcher B. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Analysis of smooth muscle cells showed no negative influence of elevated homocysteine concentrations on fibrillin-1 deposition in the extracellular matrix (32Majors A.K. Pyeritz R.E. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, reduced cysteine concentrations, which are also found in patients with homocystinuria, decreased the amount of fibrillin-1 deposited into the matrix (32Majors A.K. Pyeritz R.E. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has been shown for other cbEGF domain-containing proteins such as thrombomodulin or protein C that homocysteine can inactivate these proteins (33Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that homocysteine modifies the structure of procaryotically expressed fibrillin-1 and Notch1 fragments by reshuffling of disulfide bonds and covalent binding of homocysteine to cbEGF domains (34Hutchinson S. Aplin R.T. Webb H. Kettle S. Timmermans J. Boers G.H. Handford P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Here, we demonstrate that homocysteine in concentrations found in patients with homocystinuria lead to structural modifications of recombinant human fibrillin-1 fragments and loss of calcium binding. These molecular alterations lead to enhanced protease sensitivity. Based on these data, we suggest that degradation of fibrillin-1 in the connective tissues of patients with homocystinuria plays a major role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Constructs—The following three expression constructs for human fibrillin-1 fragments were designed with hexahistidine tags at the C-terminal end which were introduced with appropriate antisense primers for the respective PCR to facilitate protein purification. Due to the cloning strategy, all sequences are preceded at the N-terminal end by Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala. The template for PCR was cDNA clone HFBN8 (35Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To generate the expression plasmid for rF1B coding for Asp952—Val1196, the 766-bp NheI-XhoI-restricted PCR product generated with oligonucleotides 5′-ATCGTAGCTAGCTGATATCCGCCTGGAAACCTGC-3′ and 5′-ACCGAACTCGAGCTATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAACACAAAATAGCCTATCGGGAG-3′ was subcloned into the NheI-XhoI-restricted pDNSP-rF51 (14Vollbrandt T. Tiedemann K. El Hallous E. Lin G. Brinckmann J. John H. Bätge B. Notbohm H. Reinhardt D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32924-32931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pDNSP-rF1B. The expression plasmid for rF1C coding for Asp1197-Thr1362 (pDNSP-rF1C) was produced by subcloning the 529-bp NheI-XhoI-restricted PCR fragment amplified with 5′-ATCGTAGCTAGCTGACATTGATGAATGCAGCATAATG-3′ and 5′-ACCGAACTCGAGCTATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAGTGCACTTAATGCCATCTCC-3′ into the NheI-XhoI-restricted pDNSP-rF51. To produce the expression plasmid for rF1D coding for Asp1363-Val1527, the 530-bp NheI-ApaI PCR fragment generated with 5′-ATCGTAGCTAGCTGATCTGGACGAATGTTCCAATGG-3′ and 5′-AATTAAGGGCCCTATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAACACAGCCAACTCGAGTTGGG-3′ was fused with the NheI-ApaI-restricted pDNSP-rF51, resulting in a plasmid termed pDNSP-rF1D. The correct sequence of all expression plasmids was verified by commercial DNA sequencing (Agowa, Berlin).Transfection of Cells and Culture Conditions—Human embryonic kidney cells (293, American Type Culture Collection) were transfected with the PvuI-linearized expression plasmids described above using calcium phosphate as described (36Lin G. Tiedemann K. Vollbrandt T. Peters H. Bätge B. Brinckmann J. Reinhardt D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50795-50804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Selection of recombinant clones started after 24 h with 0.25 mg/ml G418. Single colonies were isolated and propagated. Positive clones were identified by Western blotting and detection with an antibody directed against the hexahistidine tag (Invitrogen).Production and Purification of the Recombinant Polypeptides—Recombinant cell clones were grown in triple-layer flasks (Nalge Nunc International), and serum-free medium was collected every 2-3 days and stored at -20 °C. After thawing 2-3 liters of conditioned medium containing rF1B, rF1C, or rF1D, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was supplemented to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The medium was concentrated to ∼50 ml by ultrafiltration (10-kDa cutoff), dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, and loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column charged with Ni2+ (GE Healthcare). The bound histidine-tagged proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0-500 mm imidazole in the same buffer in 40 ml at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS) containing 2 mm CaCl2, and stored at -80 °C.Recombinant rF1D bound relatively weakly to the Ni2+-chelating column, and much of the material was found in the flow-through. Therefore, the flow-through after Ni2+-chelating chromatography was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.6, and loaded on a HiTrap Q anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (15 ml) of equilibration buffer containing 50-1000 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The fractions containing rF1D were pooled, concentrated to <1 ml, and loaded on a Superose 12 gel filtration column (24 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2. Recombinant rF1D eluted between 11 and 13 ml. The quality of all protein preparations was evaluated by SDS-PAGE, and the identity of each protein was verified by N-terminal sequencing.Homocysteine Preparation—A 30 mm stock solution of homocysteine was prepared from homocysteine-thiolactone (Fluka) according to the procedure of Duerre and Miller (37Duerre J.A. Miller C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 17: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 46.11 mg of homocysteine-thiolactone were dissolved in 0.3 ml of 5 n NaOH and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. About 1.5 ml of 1 m KH2PO4 was added to adjust the final pH to 7.0. After the addition of 8 ml of H2O (final calculated homocysteine concentration = 30 mm), an aliquot was removed to determine the absolute concentration of free homocysteine. This was performed with Ellman's reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions (38Sedlak J. Lindsay R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (6446) Google Scholar). Homocysteine aliquots were stored at -80 °C and thawed only once. Determination of the homocysteine concentration after 1 month indicated no substantial loss of free homocysteine.Incubation of Recombinant Proteins with Homocysteine—To mimic the exposure of fibrillin-1 to elevated homocysteine levels found in patients with homocystinuria, recombinant fragments of fibrillin-1 in TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2 were incubated with 300 μm homocysteine for 24 h at 37 °C. Due to the short half-life of homocysteine in solution (∼2 h), a second 300 μm aliquot was added to the proteins after 12 h.Calcium Binding Studies—To remove calcium from either the non-treated or the homocysteine-modified fragments dissolved in TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2, the samples were supplemented with 10 mm EDTA and incubated for 1 h at ∼20 °C and then dialyzed for 24 h against TBS in the presence of 5 g/100 ml Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad). The dialysis buffer was changed 4 times, and the last buffer volume was filtered to retain the Chelex-100 resin and used as calcium-free TBS to prepare calcium stock solutions and to adjust the protein concentration of calcium-free recombinant proteins. Equilibrium dialysis was performed with DispoEquilibrium Dialyzers (Harvard Apparatus) equipped with a membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 1000. 50 μl of protein solution in calcium-free TBS was dialyzed against 50 μl of 0.05-2 mm CaCl2 in TBS including trace amounts of 45Ca2+ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After dialysis for 24 h at 37 °C, 2-3 15-μl aliquots were counted in a scintillation counter (Win-Spectral α/β 1414, Wallac). For curve fitting, equal and independent binding sites were assumed using the fitting function [bound Ca2+]/[recombinant fragment] = n× [free Ca2+]/(Kd average + [free Ca2+]), where n = the number of binding sites, and Kd average = the average thermodynamic dissociation constant. To verify that the hexahistidine tags on the C-terminal end of the proteins did not contribute to calcium binding, a control protein (main proteinase from the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus) containing a hexahistidine tag was tested under identical conditions by calcium equilibrium dialysis. This control protein did not bind calcium.Protease Degradation Experiments—The unmodified or homocysteine-modified recombinant fibrillin-1 fragments rF1B, rF1C, and rF1D were incubated in the presence or absence of 6.25-9.5 mm CaCl2 in TBS with trypsin (E.C. 3.4.21.4, Sigma) or α-chymotrypsin (E.C. 3.4.21.1, Sigma) for up to 16 h. After removing a control sample at time 0, the enzymes were added in a ratio of 1:40 (w/w) and incubated at 30 °C (chymotrypsin) or 37 °C (trypsin) as instructed by the supplier. Samples were removed after 0.5, 1, 2, and 16 h and immediately transferred into reducing 4-fold concentrated sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and chilled on ice until all samples were collected for analysis by SDS gel electrophoresis (15% acrylamide (w/v)). The protein fragments were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.N-terminal Sequencing—To determine the amino acid sequence of the recombinant proteins and the protease degradation products, the fragments were separated by reducing (20 mm dithiothreitol) SDS gel electrophoresis, blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore), and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The fragments of interest were cut out and directly sequenced with an automated protein sequencer (Model Procise 494, Applied Biosystems). For identification of the N-terminal amino acid in each sequencing cycle, it was reacted with phenylisothiocyanate, removed as an anilinothiazoline derivative, converted to the more stable phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid (PTH-AA), separated by a high performance liquid chromatography gradient system, and compared with an external standard mixture of known PTH-AAs.Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—The CD spectra of the recombinant unmodified and homocysteine-modified fibrillin-1 fragments (0.5 mg/ml in TBS) were recorded in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2. Homocysteine-treated samples were extensively dialyzed before the analysis to remove free homocysteine. The samples were analyzed in quartz cuvettes on a Jasco J-175 instrument. Spectra were recorded from 200 to 250 nm at 20 °C. Secondary structure analysis was performed with the ContinLL method (39Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 40van Stokkum I.H. Spoelder H.J. Bloemendal M. van Grondelle R. Groen F.C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar).Labeling of Homocysteine and Immunofluorescence—For labeling of homocysteine with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), 100 μl of FITC (5 mg/ml in Me2SO) was added in 5-μl aliquots to 1 ml of 19 mm homocysteine in Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The reaction mixture was incubated at 4°C for 8 h in the dark. To stop the reaction, 12 μl of 5 m NH4Cl was added. The FITC-labeled homocysteine (Hcy-FITC) was sterile-filtrated and stored at -80 °C. As a control, Tris-HCl was labeled in an identical fashion (Tris-FITC).For immunofluorescence, normal human dermal fibroblasts (passage 8-9) were prepared as described in detail previously (36Lin G. Tiedemann K. Vollbrandt T. Peters H. Bätge B. Brinckmann J. Reinhardt D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50795-50804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and seeded at densities of 7.5 × 104 cells/well in 8-well chamber slides (Permanox; Nalge Nunc International) resulting in a confluent cell layer after attachment of the cells. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in the presence of Hcy-FITC or Tris-FITC at a final concentration of 300 μm. The medium was changed daily, and 2-4 days after seeding the cells were fixed with 70% (v/v) methanol/30% (v/v) acetone and either visualized directly with an Axioskop2 microscope (Zeiss) or further stained with the polyclonal antiserum α-rF6H reacting with the C-terminal half of fibrillin-1 (15Tiedemann K. Bätge B. Müller P.K. Reinhardt D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36035-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To reduce potential disulfide bonds between Hcy-FITC and the cysteine residues of fibrillin-1 and other matrix proteins, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP; Sigma) was used in concentrations of 10 mm in phosphate-buffered saline for up to 30 min.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAlthough the genetic basis for homocystinuria caused by mutations in enzymes of the methionine metabolism is well characterized, the molecular pathogenetic mechanisms leading to connective tissue abnormalities overlapping with those observed in Marfan syndrome caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 are less well understood. Based on these similar clinical symptoms, we and others hypothesized that homocysteine in elevated concentrations found in individuals with homocystinuria has the potential to modify the structure and function of fibrillin-1. To test this hypothesis, we have produced and characterized recombinant human fibrillin-1 fragments and extensively analyzed the potential of homocysteine modification as well as the structural and functional consequences on the proteins. Because mutations in the so-called neonatal region in the center of the fibrillin-1 molecule (Fig. 1) cause the most severe symptoms in Marfan syndrome, we focused on this and neighboring regions for the analysis of potential homocysteine modifications.Expression and Properties of Recombinant Human Fibrillin-1 Fragments—The fragments were recombinantly expressed in a well established human embryonic kidney cell system to ensure correct folding and posttranslational modifications. This system has been demonstrated to produce a number of other correctly folded fibrillin-1 fragments (17Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.L. Göhrin"
https://openalex.org/W1997333596,"The first step in the biosynthesis of the medicinally important carbapenem family of β-lactam antibiotics is catalyzed by carboxymethylproline synthase (CarB), a unique member of the crotonase superfamily. CarB catalyzes formation of (2<i>S</i>,5<i>S</i>)-carboxymethylproline [(2<i>S</i>,5<i>S</i>)-<i>t</i>-CMP] from malonyl-CoA and l-glutamate semialdehyde. In addition to using a cosubstrate, CarB catalyzes C-C and C-N bond formation processes as well as an acyl-coenzyme A hydrolysis reaction. We describe the crystal structure of CarB in the presence and absence of acetyl-CoA at 2.24 Å and 3.15 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal that CarB contains a conserved oxy-anion hole probably required for decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA and stabilization of the resultant enolate. Comparison of the structures reveals that conformational changes (involving His<sup>229</sup>) in the cavity predicted to bind l-glutamate semialdehyde occur on (co)substrate binding. Mechanisms for the formation of the carboxymethylproline ring are discussed in the light of the structures and the accompanying studies using isotopically labeled substrates; cyclization via 1,4-addition is consistent with the observed labeling results (providing that hydrogen exchange at the C-6 position of carboxymethylproline does not occur). The side chain of Glu<sup>131</sup> appears to be positioned to be involved in hydrolysis of the carboxymethylproline-CoA ester intermediate. Labeling experiments ruled out the possibility that hydrolysis proceeds via an anhydride in which water attacks a carbonyl derived from Glu<sup>131</sup>, as proposed for 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase. The structural work will aid in mutagenesis studies directed at altering the selectivity of CarB to provide intermediates for the production of clinically useful carbapenems."

In situ hybridization revealed that renal FP expression predominates in the cortical collecting duct (CCD). Although FP receptor activation failed to increase intracellular Ca2+, it potently inhibited vasopressin-stimulated osmotic water permeability (Lp, 10-7 cm/(atm·s)) in in vitro microperfused rabbit CCDs.

Inhibition of Lp by latanoprost was completely blocked by pertussis toxin, consistent with a Gi-coupled mechanism. Heterologous transfection of the rabbit FPr into HEK293 cells also showed that latanoprost inhibited cAMP generation via a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism but did not increase cell Ca2+.

Heterologous transfection of the rabbit FPr into HEK293 cells also showed that latanoprost inhibited cAMP generation via a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism but did not increase cell Ca2+. These studies demonstrate a functional FP receptor on the basolateral membrane of rabbit CCDs. In contrast to the Ca2+ signal transduced by other FP receptors, this renal FP receptor signals via a PT-sensitive mechanism that is not coupled to cell Ca2+. Prostaglandin F2α is a major prostaglandin excreted in urine (1Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Fejes-Toth G. Fischer C. Frolich J. J. Clin.

FP receptor mRNA is highly expressed along the genitourinary tract including ovary > uterus and kidney (7Tsuboi K. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A.

Recent studies in mouse kidneys have shown that FP receptor expression is particularly abundant in the distal convoluted tubules and cortical collecting duct (10Saito O. Guan Y. Qi Z. Davis L.S.

The cellular and functional consequences of renal FP receptor activation in these renal epithelia have not been determined. Like PGE2 (11Johnston H.H. Herzog J.P. Lauler D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1967; 213: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), intravenous infusion of PGF2α causes both a natriuresis and diuresis (4Stier Jr., C.T. Roberts II, L.J. Wong P.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 243: 487-491PubMed Google Scholar); however, because high concentrations of PGF2α can cross-activate prostaglandin E2-EP3 receptors (12Kiriyama M. Ushikubi F. Kobayashi T.

The functional activity of PGE2 in the rabbit collecting duct epithelium has been elucidated through use of the in vitro microperfused tubule (9Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 579-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 14Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F12-F23PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hebert R.L. Jacobson H.R. Fredin D.

Investig. 1998; 102: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); however, the effect of selective FP receptor activation in this segment has not previously been examined. The aim of the present study was to clone the rabbit FP receptor, determine its intrarenal distribution, and elucidate its functional activity in the kidney. cDNA Cloning of a Full-length Rabbit FP Receptor—Total RNA was purified from rabbit ovary using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega), and reverse-transcribed to single-stranded cDNA using Molony murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and 2.5 μm of random hexamers according to the manufacturer's protocol (GeneAmp RNA PCR kit; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The synthesized cDNA was then used to amplify a portion of rabbit FP cDNA using a pair of selective primers designed from conserved sequences of mouse and human FP. The upstream sense primer sequence was 5′-CTG TGC CCA CTT CTT CTA GGC-3′, and the downstream antisense primer sequence used was 5′-GTA GAG ATT CTT CAG GAC AGC-3′. PCRs were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 1 μm primers at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 2400 thermal cycler. The predicted 591-bp fragment was ligated into pCR™ II 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. BLAST and CLUSTAL were used to determine homology to the coding region of human and mouse FP receptors. 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE were used to obtain the 5′ ends of rabbit FP cDNA using the above cloned fragment of rabbit FP. Two gene-specific antisense primers were designed for 5′-RACE: primer 1 (5′-GCA CAA GAA TGA AAC ACC AAG-3′) and nested primer 2 (5′-TCT ATC TTC CCA GTC TTC AAC-3′). Two gene-specific sense primers for 3′-RACE were synthesized for obtaining the sequence downstream of the known FP cDNA: a 3′ primer (primer 3, a 21-mer, 5′-AGC AAC ACA GAC AAG GGA GAT-3′) and a nested primer (primer 4, a 21-mer, 5′-CGC TTT TTG CTC TTC GTA TGG-3′). 1 μg of total RNA from rabbit kidney (see above) was used as a template for the first strand cDNA synthesis, with primer 1 (for 5′-RACE) or the adapter primer (for 3′-RACE) and 200U SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's description (Invitrogen). The first strand cDNA was purified, and amplification of the 5′-terminal and 3′-terminal cDNA sequences was performed using primer 2 (for 5′-RACE) or primer 3 and the abridged anchor primer. For 3′-RACE, the PCR product was then used in a second nested PCR with the internal primer 4 and the abridged universal amplification primer. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles. PCR products were subcloned into pCR II vector (Invitrogen) and then sequenced. Construction of an Expression Vector Containing a Full-length FP cDNA—A full-length rabbit FP was obtained by RT-PCR using a pair of primers located in the regions of 5′-UTR and 5′ coding region (5′-ACG ACA ATG TCC ATG AAC AAT TCC-3′) and 3′-UTR and 3′ coding region (5′-GTA TTA CTG TCC TGT TAA GCT CGG-3′). A 1,107-bp full-length rabbit FP cDNA was subcloned into pRC/CMV2 vector (FP/CMV) and sequenced (Invitrogen). Expression of Rabbit FP Receptor in HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were maintained at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5.5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml neomycin. The cells were transfected with rabbit FP receptor tagged at the N terminus with c-Myc using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Clonal cell lines were selected by the addition of medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 at 48 h post-transfection. The cells expressing Myc-tagged rabbit FP receptors were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-c-Myc antibody and cultured in G418-containing medium. [3H]PGF2α Binding in FP-transfected HEK293 Cells—The cells were rinsed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA and lysed by scraping in lysis buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 40 mm indomethacin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and passage through a 21-gauge needle five times. The cell lysate was layered on a 60% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was passed through a 26-gauge needle five times and frozen at -80 °C. Membranes (30 μg of protein) were incubated with [3H]PGF2α (214 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in the absence or presence of unlabeled ligands for 1 h at 30°C in binding buffer (10 mm MES/KOH, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MnCl2). The binding reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and rapidly filtered under vacuum over Whatman GF/F filters. The filters were washed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, dried, and counted in 4 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation fluid (Packard Biosciences, Groningen, The Netherlands). For saturation binding experiments, nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 mm PGF2α (Cayman). Competition binding experiments were performed in the presence of 2 nm [3H]PGF2α. Intracellular Calcium Assay—HEK-FP cells were plated on poly-d-lysine coated 96-well black wall clear bottom plates at a density of 80,000 cells/well and used the next day for calcium assay by the FLEX station system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, growth medium was removed by aspiration, and 200 μl of Calcium-3 reagent (Molecular Devices) reconstituted in Hanks' buffered saline solution supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 10 μm probenecid was added to each well. The cells were then loaded for 60 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the plates were transferred to a FLEX station for acquisition of fluorometric data. Twenty μl of agonists were added in parallel wells, whereas the [Ca2+]i-sensitive fluorescence was monitored (λex = 485 nm, λem = 525) at 2-s intervals. Intracellular cAMP Assay—HEK-FP cells were seeded (20,000 cells/well) overnight in complete medium. Thirty minutes before agonist addition, the medium was replaced with Opti-MEM I containing 500 μm isobutylmethylxanthine. The cells were preincubated with 10 μm latanoprost (free acid) for 20 min and then stimulated by 1 μm forskolin for 5 min. [cAMP]i levels were estimated using an enzyme fragment complementation immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (DiscoveRx Corporation, Fremont, CA). Activation of EP3 Receptor Signaling by Prostanoids via pCRE/lacZ—When the rabbit EP3 receptor is transfected into HEK293 cells, it signals via a cyclic AMP response element (17Audoly L. Ma L. Feoktistov I. Breyer M. Breyer R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 140-148PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were plated at ∼50% confluence were co-transfected with 4 μg of the rabbit EP3 splice variant 77A (17Audoly L. Ma L. Feoktistov I. Breyer M. Breyer R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 140-148PubMed Google Scholar) cDNA and 4 μg of pCRE/lacZ plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000, following the manufacturer's instructions. Six hours after the addition of DNA-Lipofectamine complex, the medium was aspirated and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 μm indomethacin containing 5 mm sodium butyrate, and the cells were incubated an additional 16-18 h, at which point the cells had reached confluence. Increasing concentrations of EP3 agonist sulprostone and FP agonist latanoprost free acid were made at 2× concentration in 100 μl of volume to appropriately meet the final concentration in serum-free OPTI-MEM medium and incubated for another 6 h. After 6 h, the medium was aspirated and gently washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The plates were developed using 4 mg/ml of substrate chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside and read at 570 nm absorbance (17Audoly L. Ma L. Feoktistov I. Breyer M. Breyer R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 140-148PubMed Google Scholar). The cells transfected with pRC/CMV empty vector were treated as control for this experiment. The data were analyzed using Prizm 4.0 and the equation: sigmoidal dose response Y = Bottom + (Top - Bottom)/(1 + 10Λ(LogEC50 - X)). Solution Hybridization/RNase Protection Assays—To determine the tissue distribution of the FP receptor mRNA expression in rabbit, the 591 bp of rabbit FP cDNA fragment amplified as described above was subcloned into pCRII, and a specific riboprobe was synthesized. RNase protection assays were performed as previously described (16Guan Y. Zhang Y. Breyer R.M. Fowler B. Davis L. Hebert R.L. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmids containing the rabbit FP (591 bp) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (174 bp) were linearized, and radiolabeled were riboprobes synthesized in vitro from 1 μg of linearized plasmids using a MAXIscript™ kit (Ambion) for 1 h at 37°C in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction buffer contained 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm each ATP, CTP, and GTP, 2.5 mm of UTP, and 5 μl of 800 Ci/mmol [α-32P]UTP at 10 mCi/ml (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Hybridization buffer included 80% deionized formamide, 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.4), and 1 mm EDTA (RPA II; Ambion). Twenty μg of total RNA from various rabbit tissues were incubated at 45°C for 12 h in hybridization buffer with 5 × 104 cpm labeled riboprobes. Following hybridization, ribonuclease digestion was performed (37°C for 30 min), and protected fragments were precipitated and separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel at 200 V for 4 h. The gel was exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film overnight at -80 °C with intensifying screens. In Situ Hybridization—Kidneys from New Zealand White rabbits were utilized. A 35S-labeled antisense riboprobe generated from the 591-bp PCR fragment of rabbit FP (see above) was hybridized to the tissue sections and then washed as previously described (18Breyer M.D. Jacobson H.R. Davis L.S. Breyer R.M. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 1372-1378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The slides were dehydrated with graded ethanol containing 300 mm ammonium acetate, dipped in emulsion (Ilford K5; Knutsford, Cheshire, UK) and exposed for 4-5 days at 4 °C. After developing in Kodak D-19, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Photomicrographs were taken using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope with either dark field or bright field optics. FP mRNA Expression in Microdissected Nephron Segments—An alternative used was to map receptor mRNA by the more sensitive technique of RT-PCR. As a first step in this procedure, amplification of a fragment of the rabbit FP receptor from whole kidney was performed. Total RNA was purified using TRIzol reagent, treated with RNase-free DNase I, and transformed to single-stranded cDNA. cDNA was amplified using FP receptor selective primers derived from homology to human FP sequence: (nucleotides 780-2146 of the human cDNA sequence yielding a 1365-bp product): sense, 5′-TCTTAGCCCTTGGTGTTTCA-3′; antisense, 5′-TGGCTCAAGGTAAAGCACCT-3′. Tubule segments were microdissected from collagenase-digested kidneys prepared as previously described (19Breyer M.D. Redha R. Breyer J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F553-F558PubMed Google Scholar), and FP receptor was amplified by RT-PCR. PCRs contained 100 nm primers, 1 μm Mg2+, 40 nm deoxynucleotide trisphosphates, reaction buffer, and 10 units of Pfu Turbo® DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in a final volume of 50 μl. PCR was performed by hot start, using 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min. Thirty-five PCR cycles were also performed with the rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers sets to normalize for RNA loading. In Vitro Microperfusion of Collecting Ducts—Individual freehand microdissected cortical collecting ducts were perfused in vitro as previously described (15Hebert R.L. Jacobson H.R. Fredin D. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F643-F650PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hebert R.L. Jacobson H.R. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbits weighing 1.5-2.5 kg were sacrificed by using an intramuscular injection of ketamine (44 mg/kg) and xylazine (11 mg/kg) for anesthesia followed by decapitation. The left kidney was quickly removed, and 1-2-mm coronal slices were placed in chilled dissection dishes for freehand dissection. Tubules were transferred to a thermostatically controlled chamber of 1-cm3 volume and cannulated using concentric micropipettes. Bath solution was continuously exchanged at 0.5 ml/min by infusion pump (Sage; Orion Research Incorporated, Cambridge, MA) and was maintained at 37 °C. The composition of standard bath medium, dissection medium, and isotonic perfusate were as follows: 105 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm sodium acetate, 2.3 mm NaHPO4, 5 mm KCL, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgSO4, 8.3 glucose, and 5 mm alanine (osmolality, 300 mOsmol/kg). The composition of hypotonic perfusate was identical to that of isotonic perfusate except for a reduction in NaCl concentration to 30 mm, yielding 150 mOsmol/kg, and the addition of [3H]inulin to the perfusate as a volume marker. Both isotonic and hypotonic perfusate also contained 0.2 mg/ml Food, Drug, and Cosmetic dye No. 3 (Aniline and Chemical Co., Chicago, IL) to detect cell damage and perfusate leakage (15Hebert R.L. Jacobson H.R. Fredin D. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F643-F650PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hebert R.L. Jacobson H.R. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Measurement of Water Flux (Hydraulic Conductivity, Lp) in Microperfused Tubules—Perfusate containing [3H]inulin (75 μCi/ml) was collected into a constriction pipette of known volume (between 90 and 130 nl) for determination of [3H]inulin counts/nl (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The luminal perfusion rate was maintained between 12 and 20 nl/min by adjusting the hydrostatic pressure. At this perfusion rate osmotic equilibration between bath and lumen did not occur. During the initial 45 min after cannulation, all of the tubules were perfused with an isotonic solution similar to the bath. Subsequently, the perfusate was changed the hypotonic solution. Base-line hydraulic conductivity was determined following an additional 30 min of further equilibration from three timed collections. AVP (46 pm) was then added to the bath, and after a 15-min equilibration period three or four additional timed collections were performed for hydraulic conductivity (Lp). A stable Lp was usually observed 20-50 min after the addition of AVP. Subsequently, latanoprost or sulprostone (0.1 μm) was added (latanoprost/sulprostone + AVP). Six more timed collections were made for Lp determination. In each period the three collections with the greatest calculated Lp were averaged to calculate the mean Lp for this period. Data from tubules with a negative basal Lp (reflecting an inulin leak) were discarded. In other experiments latanoprost was added prior to the addition of vasopressin. Three timed collections of luminal perfusate were made in to a pipette of known volume for calculation of basal hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Subsequently, the PGF2α analogue, latanaprost-free acid (1 μm), was added to the bath, and after a 15-30-min equilibration period, three additional timed collections were made to determine the effects of latanoprost on the control Lp. AVP (46 pm) was added in the continued presence of latanoprost, and after 10 min of equilibration, six timed collections were made. The peak Lp was defined as the mean of the three largest contiguous Lp values. Peak Lp was usually observed 15-25 min after the addition of AVP. Calculation of Hydraulic Conductivity (Lp)—Net volume reabsorption (Jv) was calculated as: Jv = (Vi - Vo)/L, where Vi is the perfusion rate (nl/min), Vo represents the collection rate (nl/min), and L is the tubule length. Vo was measured directly, and Vi was calculated as: Vi = Vo (cpmo/cpmi), where cpmo and cpmi are perfusate and collected fluid 3H counts·min-1 ·nl-1, respectively. Hydraulic conductivity (Lp; 10-7 cm/(atm·s) was calculated according to Dubois et al. (21DuBois R. Verniory A. Abramov M. Kidney Int. 1976; 10: 478-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Lp=(1/RTS)⋅(1/Ob)2[Ob⋅(Vi−Vo)+Oi⋅Vi⋅ln{(Ob−Oi)⋅V1/(Ob⋅Vo−Oi⋅Vi)}](Eq.1) where R is the gas constant, T is temperature (K), S is the CCD lumen surface area (assumed luminal diameter of 20 μm), and Ob and Oi represent the osmolality of the bath and perfusate, respectively. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Concentration [Ca2+]i in Isolated Perfused CCDs—Tubules were perfused in vitro as previously described (20Hebert R.L. Jacobson H.R. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The methods were similar to those described above with the following exceptions: 1) the bath perfusion chamber was a special low volume (0.150 ml) chamber to allow for rapid fluid exchange and 2) bath solution was preheated in using a heated water-jacketed line, and flow rate was between 0.5 and 2.5 ml/min. Tubules were bathed in 2.5 μm acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) for 45 min at 30 °C (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min). After loading, the flow rate was increased to 2.5 ml/min, and the bath temperature was increased to 37 °C, and CCDs were equilibrated for 20-30 min. Intracellular fura-2 fluorescence intensity was measured using continuous rapidly alternating excitation (20 ms/reading) from dual monochrometers set at 340 and 380 nm, respectively (Deltascan, Photon Technology International, New Brunswick, NJ). The monochrometer output was coupled to the inverted microscope using a 400-nm dichroic mirror and a 100× lens (Nikon fluor oil immersion). Fluorescent emission of light greater than 435 nm was measured by photon counting. Before loading with fura-2, CCD autofluorescence and background light were measured; this value was continuously subtracted from all measurements. The corrected emission intensity ratio, using 340- and 380-nm excitation (340/380 ratio, R), was continuously recorded by a computer Changes interface. in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were estimated from the change in the 340/380 ratios. Reagents—AVP, EGTA, PGF2α, and PGE2 were purchased from Sigma. 3H-Labeled inulin was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 and 4Br-A23187 were purchased from Molecular Probes. Latanoprost, cloprostenol, fluprostenol, and sulprostone were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Indomethacin was purchased from Sigma. Chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside was purchased from Roche Applied Sciences. Lipofectamine 2000 and OPTI-MEM were purchased from Invitrogen. Statistics—Student's t tests for unpaired data were used when only two unrelated treatment groups were compared. To determine the statistical significance of differences between more than two groups, analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Kuel multiple comparison test was used. The differences of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. cDNA Cloning of Full-length Rabbit FP Receptor—A 591-bp fragment of rabbit FP was amplified by RT-PCR from rabbit ovary using a pair of primers designed from conserved sequences of mouse and human FP. 5′-RACE yielded a single 755-bp fragment, sharing high sequence homology to human and mouse FP sequences. 3′-RACE yielded an additional single 1,137-bp fragment. This product overlaps the original 591-bp PCR product by 92 bp and extended the known rabbit FP 3′ sequence by 1,045 bp. The sequence includes a termination codon, TAA, in the open reading frame, as well as a 892-bp 3′-UTR with no poly(A) tail or putative polyadenylation signal, suggesting there may be an additional 3′-UTR sequence missing. Assembly of the RT-PCR and RACE product sequences yielded a putative full-length rabbit FP open reading frame consisting of 1,101 bp (Fig. 1) encoding a polypeptide of 366 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 40,995 Daltons (Fig. 1). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of rabbit FP with human and mouse homologs revealed 92.76 and 87.70% identity, respectively (Fig. 2). A NCBI Conserved Domain Search revealed that the cloned rabbit FP sequence encodes a protein belonging to the rhodopsin family of seven transmembrane receptor (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/).FIGURE 2Alignment of predicted amino acid sequences for rabbit, human and mouse FP receptors.

In addition, lower levels of FP mRNA expression were detected in the kidney with barely detectable expression in other tissues tested including heart, liver, spleen, lung, brain, stomach, large intestine, and aorta (Fig. 3). Localization of FP Receptor mRNA in Rabbit Kidney—In situ hybridization confirmed that FP receptor exhibits localized expression along the nephron in rabbit kidney (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4A, specific FP mRNA signals were detected in the kidney using an antisense riboprobe, with no signal detected using the sense riboprobe.

https://openalex.org/W2010082627,"The rate of cleavage secretion of the enzymatically active ectodomain of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein and by the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C. Here, we report that both calmodulin inhibitor (CaMI) and calmodulin kinase inhibitor could also enhance cleavage secretion of ACE. This effect was accompanied by the dissociation of calmodulin from a specific region within the cytoplasmic domain of ACE to which it had been bound. The same domain of ACE was phosphorylated, and both CaMI and PMA caused dephosphorylation of ACE as well. Mass spectrometric and mutational analyses identified Ser730 as the only phosphorylated residue in the cytoplasmic domain of ACE. The Ser730 → Ala mutant of ACE was not phosphorylated, but it still bound calmodulin, and its cleavage secretion was enhanced by both CaMI and PMA. Similarly, when Ser730 was replaced by the phosphoserine mimetic, Asp, cleavage secretion of the resultant mutant remained susceptible to the enhancing effect of CaMI and PMA. These results demonstrate that, although CaMI and PMA can enhance both cleavage secretion of ACE and its dephosphorylation, the two effects are not mutually interdependent.

Numerous integral membrane proteins can release their biologically active ectodomain from the cell surface to the extracellular milieu by a regulated proteolytic event called “ectodomain shedding” (1Arribas J.

The proteases responsible for ectodomain shedding, the “sheddases,” are also a member of transmembrane protein family (7Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem.

ACE (also known as kininase II and CD143) is a central component of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and fluid homeostasis. ACE participates in blood pressure regulation by converting inactive decapeptide angiotensin I to vasoactive octapeptide angiotensin II and by inactivating the vasodilator bradykinin. ACE exists as two isoforms, namely somatic ACE (sACE) and germinal ACE (gACE), which are generated from the same gene with tissue-specific choice of transcription from two alternative promoters (19Kumar R.S. Thekkumkara T.J. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3854-3862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Somatic ACE, the larger isoform (170 kDa), is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, renal epithelial cells, neuronal cells, and macrophages and is involved in regulation of blood pressure and renal function. Germinal ACE, the smaller isoform (116 kDa), is expressed only in maturing sperm cells and is involved in male fertility. Studies on tissue-specific expression of ACE revealed that expression of sACE in vascular endothelial tissue is essential for maintaining normal blood pressure (20Kessler S.P. Senanayake P.d.

Both the isoforms of ACE are expressed on the cell surface as a type I ectoprotein, with a short cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and a long extracellular domain containing the active site(s), and are cleaved on the membrane proximal region to release the enzymatically active extracellular domain in the body fluid, including serum (21Ramchandran R.

Our previous studies on rabbit gACE demonstrated that ACE shedding is a regulated event, which can be stimulated by phorbol esters (PMA) and inhibited by specific metalloprotease inhibitor (Compound 3/TAPI II) (22Ramchandran R. Kasturi S. Douglas J.G. Sen I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H744-H751PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the ACE molecule is cleaved at 663RS664 on the membrane-proximal region to generate the soluble form (22Ramchandran R. Kasturi S. Douglas J.G. Sen I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H744-H751PubMed Google Scholar). The protease responsible for ACE cleavage is the putative ACE secretase, a metalloprotease, which is different from TACE (23Sadhukhan R. Santhamma K.R. Reddy P. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. Sen I. J.

Ectodomain shedding of ACE and other physiologically important ectoproteins appears to be an important cellular function, but the regulation of this process is not yet fully understood. We have shown earlier that gACE is associated with specific cellular proteins such as immunoglobulin-binding protein and protein kinase C isozymes and this association can regulate the cleavage secretion of ACE (27Santhamma K.R. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23253-23258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified another cellular protein, calmodulin (CaM), which binds to the cytoplasmic domain of ACE and regulates its shedding. Recently we also showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of the ectodomain of ACE regulates ACE shedding (28Santhamma K.R. Sadhukhan R. Kinter M. Chattopadhyay S. McCue B. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40227-40236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we show that ACE is also phosphorylated on a specific serine residue of the cytoplasmic domain. However, in contrast to tyrosine phosphorylation, serine phosphorylation of ACE does not directly regulate the rate of its ectodomain shedding. Materials—Anti-calmodulin and anti-phosphoserine/threonine antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories; trifluoperazine and PMA were from Sigma; and protein kinase inhibitors were from Calbiochem. Compound 3 ([N-[dl-[2-(hydroxyaminocarbonyl)-methyl]-4-methylpentanoyl]-l-3-(tert-butyl)alanyl-l-alanine, 2-aminoethyl amide) was generously supplied by Dr. Roy Black (Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA). Polyclonal antiserum (anti-ACE) was raised against pure ACE and used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of ACE (29Sen I. Kasturi S. Jabbar M.A. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25748-25754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide antibody (anti-carboxyl-terminal peptide), which specifically recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of ACE, was raised against a synthetic peptide containing the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of cellular rabbit ACE (24Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—ACE89, a mouse epithelial cell line, permanently transfected with rabbit gACE expression vector, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 10 μm CdCl2 (30Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston W.I. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were maintained in a similar media (except that CdCl2 was omitted) and transiently transfected with rabbit gACE using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated as described before (31Scarpati E.M. DiCorleto P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3025-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Isolated cells were maintained in MCDB 105 (Sigma), supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 0.009% heparin, and 0.015% endothelial cell growth factors on fibronectin-coated flasks, and used from passage 2 for experiments. Rabbit Lung Extract—Extracts of rabbit lungs were obtained using previously described methods (22Ramchandran R. Kasturi S. Douglas J.G. Sen I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H744-H751PubMed Google Scholar). 35S Labeling of Cells, Immunoprecipitation, and Quantification of Cleavage Secretion—Confluent ACE89 or transiently transfected HeLa cells were first incubated in methionine/cysteine-free medium for 1 h, and then labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) 0.5 h; the label was chased for the time periods as indicated in figures. Trifluoperazine and other agents were added to the medium as detailed in the figure legends and under “Results.” At the end of the chase period, ACE was immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts (cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA) and the culture media with anti-ACE. Immunoprecipitated ACE was then analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography (25Sadhukhan R. Sen G.C. Ramchandran R. Sen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The dried gels were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis, to quantify the amount of ACE present in the cell extract and the culture medium. Cleavage secretion was calculated as the amount of medium ACE over the total ACE present in cell extracts and culture medium. Underglycosylated ACE was, however, present in the immunoprecipitate, not considered for cleavage secretion, because it was not cleaved in the medium. 32P Labeling of Cells—Confluent ACE89 or transfected HeLa cells were incubated in phosphate-free culture media for 1 h and then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (50 μCi/60-mm plate, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 16 h and then treated with CaMI or PMA, as detailed under “Results.” Labeled cells were extracted in an alternative lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). ACE was immunoprecipitated by anti-ACE, and the immunoprecipitate was resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The phosphorylated ACE was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. ACE Activity Measurement—ACE activity was assayed by using hippuryl-l-histidyl-l-leucine (Hip-His-Leu) as the substrate and measuring fluorometrically the His-Leu liberated at 5 mm Hip-His-Leu (29Sen I. Kasturi S. Jabbar M.A. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25748-25754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation by Anti-phosphoserine/Threonine Antibody—Serine-phosphorylated ACE in the ACE89 cell extracts (in the alternative lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture) was immunoprecipitated by rabbit anti-phosphoserine/threonine as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the immunoprecipitate was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-ACE. Western Blotting—Membrane-bound and -secreted ACE was immunoblotted with anti-ACE. Cell-bound cytoplasmic peptide of ACE, from the solubilized membranes of ACE89 cells, was resolved in 4–20% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and Western blotted with anti-carboxyl-terminal peptide antibody. For calmodulin immunoblotting the anti-ACE immunoprecipitates were resolved in 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blotted with anti-calmodulin (anti-CaM). Purification and Carboxyl-terminal Sequencing of Soluble ACE—Secreted ACE was purified from culture media of either untreated or PMA-treated ACE89 cells, using Lisinopril-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described before (32Ehlers M.R.W. Chen P.Y.N. Riordan J.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1991; 2: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The eluted pure ACE was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and it appeared as a single band, when stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. 165 μg (1.5 nmol) of purified ACE was digested with Carboxypeptidase Y (Sigma) at a substrate to enzyme molar ratio of 35:1, in a digestion buffer containing 100 μl of pyridyl acetate and 100 μl of 0.2% Rapigest (a denaturing agent, Waters). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and samples (15 μl) taken at various time points were used for amino acid analysis. 2 nmol of bovine serum albumin was used as a control for the analysis. Purification of Cell-bound Carboxyl-terminal Peptide of ACE from ACE89 Cells—Confluent ACE89 cells (150 mm) were incubated with PMA (500 nm) in serum-free medium for 1 h. The cells were harvested after washing twice with serum-free medium and suspended in 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After three cycles of rapid freezing and thawing at 37 °C, the suspension was homogenized in glass-glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of homogenization buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After 30 min on ice, the samples were similarly centrifuged, and the supernatant containing the carboxyl-terminal peptide of ACE was used for further purification. Purification of the carboxyl-terminal peptide was performed using the procedure described in a previous study (24Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, the above preparation of carboxyl-terminal peptide was passed through an immunoaffinity column, prepared by purified IgG from anti-carboxyl-terminal peptide polyclonal antiserum, and coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma), using the manufacturer's instructions. The antibody-coupled Sepharose was washed as mentioned previously (24Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.8, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The eluate was then passed through an fast-protein liquid chromatography column (Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences)), and the fractions containing the carboxyl-terminal peptide of ACE were pooled and concentrated. The pooled fraction was further purified by a C4 reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography column (Vydac) and eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The single fraction containing the carboxyl-terminal fragment was used for Mass specrometric analysis and amino-terminal sequencing. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of the Purified Cell-bound Cytoplasmic Fragment—An in-gel tryptic digest of the 8-kDa Coomassie Blue-stained band was analyzed using capillary column LC-tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide mapping and phosphopeptide detection were carried out using an LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer system (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray ionization source (Protana, Odense, Denmark). The source was operated under microspray conditions at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The digests were analyzed by reversed-phase capillary high-performance liquid chromatography using a 50-μm i.d. column with a 15-μm i.d. tip (New Objective Corp., Woburn, MA). The column was packed with ∼6 cm of C18 packing material (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA) and eluted using a 45-min gradient of increasing acetonitrile (2–70%) in 50 mm acetic acid. The data were acquired in the data-dependent mode, recording a mass spectrum and three collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra in repetitive cycles (33Kintner M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. John Wiley and Sons, New York2000: 166-206Google Scholar). The program Sequest was used to compare all CID spectra recorded to the sequence of rabbit ACE (NCBI accession number 113043) and considering the appropriate changes in the serine residue mass of +80 Da. The data were also searched in the chromatographic mode for neutral loss of 33 and 49 Da, corresponding the loss of H3PO4 from triply and doubly charged ions (respectively), using the instrument data system program Xcaliber. The molecular weight of the intact cleaved carboxyl-terminal fragment was also measured with this system using the same chromatographic conditions but recording only mass spectra. The elution of the fragment protein was recognized by plotting a base peak chromatogram, with the resultant mass spectrum produced by averaging the spectra across that chromatographic peak. Amino-terminal Sequencing—The amino-terminal sequencing of the purified cell-bound carboxyl-terminal peptide of ACE, blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, was carried out by Edman degradation (34Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar, 35Hunkapillar M.W. Hewick R.M. Dreyer W.J. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 399Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), using a Procise, Model 492, protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) fitted with a 140c microgradient system, 785A programmable absorbance detector, and a 610A (version 2.1) data analysis system. Mutation of Serine Residues in Intracellular Domain of ACE—Site-directed mutagenesis by the mega primer PCR method (36Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) was used for mutating Ser713, Ser718, Ser730, and Ser737 of ACE cytoplasmic domain. CaM Inhibitors Stimulate Cleavage Secretion of ACE—In ACE89 cells, ACE is constitutively cleaved and secreted at a slow basal rate. Upon addition of trifluoperazine, an inhibitor of calmodulin (CaMI), to the culture medium, secretion of ACE, as assessed by measuring the enzyme activity of cleaved ACE in the medium, increased linearly up to an inhibitor concentration of 20 μm (Fig. 1A). To confirm the stimulatory effect of trifluoperazine on ACE cleavage secretion, ACE89 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, and the biosynthesis, processing, and cleavage secretion of newly synthesized labeled ACE molecules were followed in the presence of the inhibitor. ACE-related proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell extract and the culture media by anti-ACE antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. ACE cleavage secretion, as quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis of dried gels, increased in the presence of 10 and 20 μm concentration of the CaMI, from a basal level of 13 ± 2% to 42 ± 2% and 53 ± 3%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Compound 3, a known inhibitor of ACE-secretase blocked the CaMI-induced secretion as well, indicating that the effect of CaMI was mediated by the ACE-secretase. To examine whether CaM could also regulate ACE secretion from natural ACE-producing cells, we used primary HUVEC cultures. When CaMI was added to the HUVEC culture media, the secretion of sACE was enhanced, as detected by the increased ACE activity in the medium (Fig. 1C). When Compound 3, an inhibitor of ACE-secretase, was present in the media, the enhanced secretion of ACE by CaMI was inhibited. Most of the intracellular effects of CaM are mediated by protein phosphorylation catalyzed by CaM-dependent protein kinases (37Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). CaM kinase II, a multifunctional protein, which has been studied extensively, is known to mediate many of the biological effects of CaM. To determine if CaM kinase II plays a role in ACE cleavage secretion, we investigated the effect of KN-93, a specific inhibitor of CaM kinase II, on ACE cleavage secretion. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, KN-93 added to ACE89 cells, increased the secretion of ACE in a concentration-dependent manner. Again, pulse-chase experiments, in the presence of KN-93, confirmed these observations. Fig. 2B shows that 14 ± 1% of ACE was secreted out from the untreated cells in 2 h, whereas secretion increased to 21 ± 2% when cells were treated with 20 μm KN-93. The observed increase of cleavage secretion induced by inhibitors of both CaM (Fig. 1), as well as CaM kinase II (Fig. 2), strongly suggests that CaM influences the cleavage secretion process. Residues 709–719 in the Cytoplasmic Domain of ACE Are Required—We used a transient transfection system of ACE expression in HeLa cells for delineating the region of ACE required for the enhancement of cleavage secretion by CaMI. We have shown previously that in this system ACE is synthesized and cleavage-secreted in a manner similar to that of ACE89 cells (29Sen I. Kasturi S. Jabbar M.A. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25748-25754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we expressed a mutant ACE, from which the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain had been deleted completely (gACEΔ709–737), the cells secreted the mutant ACE more efficiently than the wild type ACE (TABLE ONE; see also Ref. 25Sadhukhan R. Sen G.C. Ramchandran R. Sen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A partial deletion of this domain (gACEΔ719–737) did not enhance secretion significantly, indicating that residues 709–719 might slow down the process of cleavage secretion. Trifluoperazine increased cleavage secretion of Wt ACE (14 ± 1% to 34 ± 1%) and the partial carboxyl-terminal-tail deleted mutant to a similar extent (TABLE ONE). On the contrary, secretion of the mutant gACEΔ709–737, from which the entire cytoplasmic domain had been deleted, was not affected significantly (25–28%) by CaMI treatment. Another mutant, from which only the residues 709–719 had been deleted, was cleavage-secreted faster than Wt ACE (14 ± 1% to 29 ± 3%) (TABLE ONE), and CaMI treatment did not induce its secretion significantly (29 ± 3% to 34 ± 4%). These results demonstrated that residues 709–719 are required for CaMI-mediated enhanced secretion of ACE. Similar results were obtained when ACE was allowed to secrete for 4 h (data not shown).TABLE ONEResidues spanning 709–719 in the cytoplasmic domain of gACE are needed for CaMI-induced cleavage of ACEConstructSecretion, CaMI-+%gACE14 ± 134 ± 1gACEΔ719-73717 ± 332 ± 2gACEΔ709-73725 ± 128 ± 1gACEΔ709-71929 ± 334 ± 4 Open table in a new tab Role of MEK and Protein Kinase p38 in CaMI-induced Cleavage Secretion of ACE—Because various signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of cleavage secretion of different ectoproteins we tested the roles of specific protein kinases, in the CaMI-induced cleavage secretion of ACE. ACE89 cells were pre-treated with inhibitors of different protein kinases, labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and chased for 2 h in the presence of CaMI, in the presence of the inhibitors throughout the experiment. Inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Janus Kinase 2, p70S6 kinase, or phospholipase Cγ, did not show any significant effect (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A, U0126 and SB203580, inhibitors of MEK and protein kinase p38 respectively, blocked the CaMI-induced cleavage secretion of ACE. Our observation that CaMI-induced cleavage secretion of ACE is blocked by inhibitors of MEK and protein kinase p38, suggested that constitutive activation of these signaling pathways would induce increased cleavage secretion of ACE. To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected HeLa cells with expression vectors of ACE and constitutively active (ca) MEK1 or MKK6 and observed enhanced cleavage secretion of ACE (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2107041612,"Kinetoplast DNA, the mitochondrial DNA of trypanosomatid protozoa, is a network containing several thousand topologically interlocked DNA minicircles. Kinetoplast DNA synthesis involves release of minicircles from the network, replication of the free minicircles, and reattachment of the progeny back onto the network. One enzyme involved in this process is structure-specific endonuclease-I. This enzyme, originally purified from Crithidia fasciculata, has been proposed to remove minicircle replication primers (Engel, M. L., and Ray, D. S. (1998) Nucleic Acids Res. 26, 4773-4778). We have studied the structure-specific endonuclease-I homolog from Trypanosoma brucei, showing it to be localized in the antipodal sites flanking the kinetoplast DNA disk, as previously shown in C. fasciculata. RNA interference of structure-specific endonuclease-I caused persistence of a single ribonucleotide at the 5′ end of both the leading strand and at least the first Okazaki fragment in network minicircles, demonstrating that this enzyme in fact functions in primer removal. Probably because of the persistence of primers, RNA interference also impeded the reattachment of newly replicated free minicircles to the network and caused a delay in kinetoplast DNA segregation. These effects ultimately led to shrinkage and loss of the kinetoplast DNA network and cessation of growth of the cell.

Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans and similar diseases in livestock. Trypanosomes, being one of the earliest branching eukaryotes, have unusual biological properties. Their mitochondrial DNA, known as kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), 2The abbreviations used are: kDNAkinetoplast DNASSE1structure-specific endonuclease-ITdTterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent proteinRNAiRNA interferencedUTP2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphatedATP2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphateDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. is one of their most amazing features (see Refs. 1Liu B.

Within the cell, the network is condensed into a disk-shaped structure located within a distended portion of the mitochondrial matrix adjacent to the flagellar basal body. There is a trans-membrane filament system linking the kDNA network to the basal body that facilitates segregation of daughter networks following replication (4Robinson D.R. Gull K.

The T. brucei kDNA network contains several thousand minicircles that are heterogeneous in sequence (each 1 kb) and a few dozen maxicircles (each 23 kb). Maxicircles, similar to mitochondrial DNAs of higher organisms, encode rRNAs and subunits of respiratory complexes. Minicircles encode small guide RNAs that control the editing of maxicircle transcripts. Editing is a remarkable process involving the addition or deletion of uridylate residues at specific sites in the transcript to form functional mRNA (reviewed in Refs. 6Madison-Antenucci S. Grams J.

Protist. 2001; 152: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In both species, kDNA synthesis occurs in approximate synchrony with nuclear DNA replication, but division of the kinetoplast occurs prior to that of the nucleus (9Cosgrove W.B. Skeen M.J. J. Protozool. 1970; 17: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to kDNA replication, during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, all minicircles in the network are covalently closed. When kDNA replication begins, minicircles are individually released from the network into the kinetoflagellar zone (11Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a specialized region between the kDNA disk and the mitochondrial membrane adjacent to the flagellar basal body. Some replication proteins are localized in the kinetoflagellar zone, and these are responsible for the initiation of replication of the free minicircles. These proteins include the universal minicircle sequence binding protein (UMSBP) (12Abu-Elneel K. Robinson D.R. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. Shlomai J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), DNA primase (13Li C. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 10: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The free minicircles replicate unidirectionally as θ-structures yielding daughter minicircles that probably segregate in the kinetoflagellar zone. The progeny minicircles, containing nicks or gaps, then migrate to two antipodal sites that flank the kDNA disk (11Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Within these sites, subsequent steps of replication occur, catalyzed by enzymes specifically localized therein. These reactions are thought to include primer removal by a structure-specific endonuclease-I (SSE1) (15Engel M.L. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Engel M.L. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, the progeny minicircles, still containing at least one nick or gap, are attached to the edge of the kDNA network by an antipodal topoisomerase II (22Melendy T. Sheline C. Ray D.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 1083-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As replication proceeds, there is enlargement of the peripheral zones of the network (containing nicked or gapped minicircles already replicated) and a shrinkage of the central zone (containing covalently closed minicircles not yet replicated) (24Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Weijers P.J. Plasmid. 1980; 4: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Robinson D.R. Gull K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Ferguson M.F. Torri A.F. Pérez-Morga D. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When replication is complete, the minicircle copy number has doubled. Finally the double-sized network splits in two, the remaining gaps are repaired (24Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Weijers P.J. Plasmid. 1980; 4: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Robinson D.R.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the progeny networks segregate into the daughter cells during cell division. T. brucei and C. fasciculata differ in the pattern of attachment of gapped minicircles to the network. In T. brucei, gapped minicircles are attached at two antipodal sites and remain concentrated in the two polar regions (24Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Weijers P.J. Plasmid. 1980; 4: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Robinson D.R. Gull K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Ferguson M.F. Torri A.F.

In C. fasciculata, gapped minicircles are also attached at two antipodal sites but subsequently distribute uniformly around the network periphery, probably because of a relative movement of the network disk and the sites of minicircle attachment (28Simpson A.M. Simpson L. J. Protozool. 1976; 23: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Pérez-Morga D. Englund P.T. Cell. 1993; 74: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The subject of this paper is the SSE1, a mitochondrial enzyme discovered in C. fasciculata by Engel and Ray (15Engel M.L. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Engel M.L. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8455-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Hines J.C. Engel M.L. Zhao H. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, this enzyme localizes to the antipodal sites. Enzymatic studies on purified C. fasciculata SSE1 protein showed that it has RNase H and DNA endonuclease activities (15Engel M.L. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) similar to those of the FEN family of enzymes (30Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 31Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 433-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is homologous to the 5′ exonuclease domain of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (16Engel M.L. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8455-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that SSE1 may function in the removal of RNA replication primers, and studies with model substrates provide further evidence for this role (17Hines J.C. Engel M.L. Zhao H. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe experiments using RNAi to demonstrate that SSE1 indeed functions in primer removal in vivo. Furthermore, we found that SSE1 RNAi affects segregation of the kDNA network after its replication. Trypanosomes and RNAi—Procyclic T. brucei (strain 29-13, a gift from Dr. George Cross, Rockefeller University) were cultured at 27 °C in SDM-79 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (32Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A stem-loop construct for RNAi experiments, prepared as described in Ref. 32Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, contained two opposing copies of a 744-bp sequence (starting at the codon for amino acid 105 and extending into the 3′ UTR). The two copies of the SSE1 sequence were separated by a spacer sequence (32Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Trypanosomes were transfected with the RNAi construct, selected by phleomycin (2.5 μg/ml), and then cloned by limiting dilution. Expression of double-stranded RNA was induced by tetracycline (1 μg/ml) (32Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). RNA Purification and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from mid-log phase cells (10 ml) using the Purescript RNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems) and then fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 7% formaldehyde. After transfer to a nylon membrane, the SSE1 mRNA was detected with a 32P-labeled probe made from the same fragment used in the stem-loop construct (32Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). DNA Purification and Analysis—Total DNA was purified as described previously (23Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) as was kDNA (29Pérez-Morga D. Englund P.T. Cell. 1993; 74: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). kDNA networks (isolated from 2.5 × 108 cells) were decatenated in a 20-μl reaction (60 min, 37 °C) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 μm dithiothreitol, 500 μm EDTA, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.0 mm ATP, and 10 units of human topoisomerase IIα (a gift of Dr. Leroy Liu, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School). Covalently closed minicircles from decatenated networks were isolated from an agarose-ethidium bromide gel identical to that used in Fig. 3. All restriction enzymes and buffers were from New England Biolabs. For alkali treatment, isopropyl alcohol-precipitated DNA was dissolved in 0.3 m NaOH containing 50 mm EDTA, incubated overnight at 37 °C, neutralized with HCl, and isopropyl alcohol-precipitated again. The kDNA, with or without alkali treatment, was redissolved in 10 μl of denaturing gel sample buffer (98% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF), heated for 6 min at 100 °C, chilled, and then loaded immediately on the gel. The 9% 40.5-cm polyacrylamide denaturing gel containing 8 m urea was cast and run in Tris borate-EDTA buffer (1600 volts, ∼6 h). The DNA was then electrotransferred to a nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The oligonucleotide probe for detection of the first Okazaki fragment is 5′-AAAATAGCACGGGATTTGTGTATG-3′ and that for the 5′ end of the leading strand is 5′-CATACACAAATCCCGTGCTATTTT-3′. Both sequences are within the minicircle-conserved region (33Hong M. Simpson L. Protist. 2003; 154: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and therefore should recognize all of the minicircles. The probes were 5′-radiolabeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Southern hybridization was carried out overnight at 55 °C in 5× SSPE (0.75 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mm Na2EDTA), 1% SDS, 1× Denhardt's solution (34Wang Z. Drew M.E. Morris J.C. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4998-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Wash conditions were as described previously (34Wang Z. Drew M.E. Morris J.C. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4998-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Localization of SSE1—For intracellular localization, a single genomic allele of SSE1 was GFP-tagged at its C terminus using a PCR-based method (35Shen S. Arhin G.K. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, a cassette encoding GFP and a drug resistance marker, blasticidin-S deaminase, was amplified using the pXSGFPM3FUS vector (36Marchetti M.A. Tschudi C. Kwon H. Wolin S.L. Ullu E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the template. Oligonucleotide primers contained 30 nucleotides homologous to the vector template plus 90 nucleotides homologous to the site of integration (upstream of the SSE1 stop codon for the forward primer and downstream of the stop codon for the reverse primer). The PCR product (4 μg) was electroporated into procyclic trypanosomes, and transformants were selected with blasticidin-S (10 μg/ml). Integration at a single SSE1 allele was confirmed by PCR. GFP-tagged SSE1 was detected using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescence was carried out as described previously (23Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In Situ and in Vitro Labeling of kDNA Networks with Fluorescently Labeled dUTP—In situ fluorescent labeling of the nicks and gaps in network minicircles with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was performed as described previously (37Johnson C.E. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in PBS. Aliquots (5 × 105 cells in 25 μl of PBS) were spotted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides and were allowed to adhere for 10 min. Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min and washed twice in PBS containing 0.1 m glycine for 5 min. After permeabilization in methanol overnight at -20 °C, the cells were rehydrated with three 5-min washes in PBS. The cells were then incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 25 μl of TdT reaction buffer (Roche Applied Science) containing 2.0 mm CoCl2. Slides were then incubated for 60 min at room temperature in a 20-μl reaction solution containing TdT reaction buffer (Roche Applied Science), 2.0 mm CoCl2, 10 μm dATP, 2.5 μm Alexa Fluor 488-dUTP (Molecular Probes), and 10 units of TdT (Roche Applied Science). The reaction was stopped with three 5-min washes in 2× SSC, 0.9× PBS, followed by two 5-min washes in PBS before proceeding with immunofluorescence. In some experiments, following TdT labeling, the basal bodies in T. brucei were detected by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody YL1/2 against yeast tyrosinated tubulin (Chemicon International, Inc.) (34Wang Z. Drew M.E. Morris J.C. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4998-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Sherwin T. Schneider A. Sasse R. Seebeck T. Gull K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Antibody labeling was as described previously (34Wang Z. Drew M.E. Morris J.C. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4998-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), except that the secondary antibody was Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes). TdT labeling of gapped minicircles in isolated networks was carried out on the surface of a slide (27Guilbride D.L. Englund P.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 675-679PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μl of the isolated kDNA networks (∼100 μg/ml, in sterile H2O) was mixed with 19 μl of PBS and settled on a poly-l-lysine-coated slide for at least 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the slide was incubated with TdT and Alexa Fluor 488-dUTP (reaction conditions described under “In Situ and in Vitro Labeling of kDNA Networks with Fluorescently Labeled dUTP”) followed by DAPI staining (2 μg/ml). In labeling isolated networks or permeabilized cells (see above) with TdT, the intensity of labeling was almost always either very strong or absent; only rarely did we observe weak labeling that could have derived from a network with nicks or gaps that were partly repaired. The latter were still defined as TdT-positive. Slides were examined on an Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Images were captured with a charge-coupled device camera (Retiga™ Exi, QImaging Corp.) using IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc.). Intracellular Localization of T. brucei SSE1—We identified the T. brucei homolog of C. fasciculata SSE1 (16Engel M.L. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8455-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) by searching the T. brucei genome data base (Tb10.100.0220 in www.genedb.org). The predicted T. brucei SSE1 protein (295 amino acids) is 63% identical to its C. fasciculata counterpart (297 amino acids), and there are no other genes closely related to SSE1 in the T. brucei genome. To localize T. brucei SSE1 intracellularly, we targeted an in-frame GFP sequence to the C terminus of one of the SSE1 chromosomal alleles (35Shen S. Arhin G.K. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We then detected the tagged protein using an anti-GFP antibody and fluorescence microscopy. The T. brucei SSE1 is concentrated in the antipodal sites flanking the kDNA disk (Fig. 1A), the same location previously reported for the C. fasciculata enzyme (16Engel M.L. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8455-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RNAi of SSE1—To verify the function of SSE1, we constructed a stem-loop vector for RNAi and transfected it into trypanosomes. After cloning, we induced synthesis of the stem-loop RNA by adding tetracycline to the cell culture. Cell growth was inhibited after 6 days of RNAi (Fig. 1B), indicating that SSE1 is essential for procyclic T. brucei. A Northern blot indicated that RNAi caused a nearly complete loss of SSE1 mRNA after 1 day; the large smear of double-stranded RNA is probably composed of fragments of the stem-loop RNA (Fig. 1C). By DAPI staining and fluorescence microscopy, we evaluated the effect of RNAi on the size of the kDNA disk. We found that RNAi of SSE1 ultimately caused shrinking and loss of the kDNA with ∼90% of the cells having no kDNA by day 10 (Fig. 1D). This loss indicates that SSE1 is essential for kDNA replication or maintenance. Surprisingly, we found during the course of RNAi that there was a transient accumulation of large kDNA, peaking at day 2. As discussed below, these networks are apparently double-sized replication intermediates, and we previously observed accumulation of larger kDNA during a preliminary RNAi study of SSE1 using the pZJM vector (32Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). These large kDNAs were present in only ∼20% of uninduced cells (day 0 in Fig. 1D), in agreement with previous results (26Ferguson M.F. Torri A.F. Pérez-Morga D. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, they increased to 50% at day 2. Subsequent to day 2, kDNA networks became smaller, and they eventually disappeared. Effect of RNAi on Replication Primers—The enzymatic properties of purified SSE1 had implied a function in primer removal (15Engel M.L. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Hines J.C. Engel M.L. Zhao H. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To test this possibility in vivo, we compared the size of minicircle primers in uninduced cells with those in cells induced for RNAi for 2 or 4 days. Although this analysis was complicated by the extensive heterogeneity of T. brucei minicircles (33Hong M. Simpson L. Protist. 2003; 154: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we were able to map primers at the 5′ ends of the leading strand and the first Okazaki fragment, because both of these sequences reside within a conserved minicircle region containing the replication origin (reviewed in Ref. 3Shlomai J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 623-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The first Okazaki fragment in the closely related parasite Trypanosoma equiperdum is ∼73 nucleotides (39Ryan K.A. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 823-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the same is true in T. brucei. 3Y. Liu, unpublished experiment. Furthermore, the gaps flanking the T. equiperdum fragment are among the last to be repaired prior to the covalent closure of network minicircles (39Ryan K.A. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 823-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ryan K.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3212-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To evaluate primers on the first T. brucei Okazaki fragment (see map in Fig. 2A), we isolated kDNA networks, digested them with TaqI, and fractionated the fragments on a denaturing 9% polyacrylamide gel. We then transferred the DNA to a nylon membrane for hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe complementary to the first Okazaki fragment (Fig. 2B). In cells not undergoing RNAi (day 0) or having undergone RNAi for 2 days, we detected an ∼66-nucleotide fragment, and this major species persisted after alkali treatment. The treatment conditions (0.3 m NaOH, 50 mm EDTA, overnight at 37 °C) were considerably more stringent than those used to cleave at ribonucleotides embedded in mammalian mitochondrial DNA (41Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, after 4 days of RNAi, there were two fragments, with the larger one (∼67 nucleotides) reduced in size by alkali treatment to that of the smaller one; therefore the ∼67-nucleotide fragment probably contained a single 5′ ribonucleotide. In another experiment, alkali treatment suggested a single 5′ ribonucleotide on this fragment at day 2. We used a similar strategy to evaluate primers on the leading strand, cleaving the isolated networks with HpyCH4 V, which cuts ∼69 nucleotides from its 5′ end (see map in Fig. 2D). We hybridized the blot with a 32P-labeled probe complementary to the 5′-terminal region of the leading strand. At day 0, we detected a fragment of ∼69 nucleotides that was not alkali-sensitive, indicating that there are no ribonucleotides at the 5′ end of the leading strand in cells not undergoing RNAi (Fig. 2E). After 2 or 4 days of RNAi, we detected fragments of ∼69, ∼70, and ∼71 nucleotides, with only the latter fragment being sensitive to alkali. This result provided evidence that the leading strand on network minicircles in RNAi cells contains a single 5′ ribonucleotide. The ∼70-nucleotide fragment, which is insensitive to alkali, must contain a 5′-terminal deoxyribonucleotide. Therefore, SSE1 in uninduced cells must be capable of removing not only a 5′ ribonucleotide but also a penultimate deoxyribonucleotide. The latter cleavage is similar to that detected when a model substrate, containing 5′ ribonucleotides mimicking a primer, was treated with recombinant SSE1 (17Hines J.C. Engel M.L. Zhao H. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Following kDNA replication and during or soon after segregation of the daughter networks, all of the minicircle gaps are repaired (see Refs. 24Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Weijers P.J. Plasmid. 1980; 4: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Ferguson M.F. Torri A.F. Pérez-Morga D. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. J.

Given the persistence of 5′ ribonucleotides following RNAi, we tested whether ribonucleotide primer remnants could be ligated into covalently closed minicircles. We isolated kDNA networks from cells undergoing RNAi for 0, 2, or 4 days, decatenated them by treatment with topoisomerase II, and isolated covalently closed minicircles by gel electrophoresis. To"

To investigate the evolutionarily conserved functions of Ku, we knocked down expression by RNA interference (RNAi) of Ku genes in C. elegans. We found that C. elegans Ku70 (CKU-70) is required for resistance to genotoxic stress, regulates cytotoxic stress responses, and influences aging. The latter effects are dependent on an IGF-1/insulin-like signaling pathway previously shown to affect life span. Reduction of CKU-70 activity amplifies the aging phenotype of long-lived insulin receptor daf-2 mutations in a daf-16-dependent manner. These observations support the view that organismal stress resistance determines life span and Ku70 modulates these effects."

EcoNth is a bifunctional enzyme that has DNA glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activities. Using a phylogeny of natural sequences, we selected to study EcoNth serine 39, aspartate 44, and arginine 184, which are presumed to be in the vicinity of the damaged base in the glycosylase-substrate complex. These three amino acids are highly conserved among Nth orthologs, although not among homologous glycosylases, such as MutY, that have different base specificities and no lyase activity. To examine the role of these amino acids in catalysis, we constructed three mutants of EcoNth, in which Ser39 was replaced with leucine (S39L), Asp44 was replaced with valine (D44V), and Arg184 was replaced with alanine (R184A), which are the corresponding residues in EcoMutY. We showed that EcoNth S39L does not have significant glycosylase activity for oxidized pyrimidines, although it maintained AP lyase activity. In contrast, EcoNth D44V retained glycosylase activity against oxidized pyrimidines, but the apparent rate constant for the lyase activity of EcoNth D44V was significantly lower than that of EcoNth, indicating that Asp44 in EcoNth is required for β-elimination. Finally, EcoNth R184A maintained lyase activity but exhibited glycosylase specificity different from that of EcoNth. The functional consequences of each of these three substitutions can be rationalized in the context of high resolution protein structures.

Homologs of Nth are present in all three phylogenetic domains. Two archaeal proteins have been purified and characterized biochemically. Nth from the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrobaculum aerophilum (PaNth), exhibits glycosylase/β-lyase activity on dihydrothymine (4Yang H. Phan I.T. Fitz-Gibbon S. Shivji M.K. Wood R.D.

Eukaryotic orthologs have been studied in a number of organisms. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are two Nth orthologs, Ntg1 and Ntg2, and like EcoNth, both enzymes are bifunctional and cleave a wide variety of oxidized substrates (6Eide L. Bjoras M.

Like EcoNth, hNTH1, bNth, and mNth1 possess DNA-glycosylase/lyase activity on oxidized pyrimidines, formamidopyrimidines, and AP sites. Thus Nth is conserved over all three phylogenetic domains, and with respect to qualitative functional features (that is, glycosylase and lyase activity), EcoNth represents the activity of orthologous proteins and their common ancestor. A closely related family member, EcoMutY, is a mismatch repair DNA glycosylase that removes adenine misincorporated opposite G, C, or 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine during replication (17Au K.G. Cabrera M.

The major function of EcoMutY is to prevent mutation fixation when 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine miscodes with A, thus avoiding potential G → T transversions (19Michaels M.L. Cruz C. Grollman A.P. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7022-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Unlike EcoNth, however, EcoMutY is a monofunctional DNA glycosylase (20Williams S.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) homologs of EcoMutY have been cloned, and their substrate specificities are the same as that of EcoMutY. Interestingly, although EcoNth and EcoMutY share no common substrates, they have significant sequence similarity at the animo acid level (Fig. 1A) (24Michaels M.L. Pham L. Nghiem Y. Cruz C. Miller J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3841-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). When the crystal structure of the archetypical member of the Nth family, EcoNth, was solved (25Kuo C.F. McRee D.E. Fisher C.L. O'Handley S.F. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Science. 1992; 258: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 26Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), a number of motifs were identified that are shared by relatives of EcoNth. The helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif, followed by a Gly/Pro-rich loop and a conserved aspartic acid (HhH-GPD motif), and the iron sulfur cluster loop, are conserved in almost all of the Nth orthologs (26Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The iron sulfur cluster does not undergo any redox reactions but appears to be involved in DNA binding (26Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). EcoMutY also contains both the HhH motif and the iron sulfur cluster (24Michaels M.L. Pham L. Nghiem Y. Cruz C. Miller J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3841-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27Cunningham R.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R576-R579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that Nth and MutY were derived from a common ancestral gene. Several amino acids have been implicated in the reaction chemistry of these proteins. For example, in EcoNth, Lys120 and Asp138, and in Eco-MutY, Asp138, have been shown to be involved in catalysis (25Kuo C.F. McRee D.E. Fisher C.L. O'Handley S.F. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A.

It has recently been proposed that Asp45 in Bacillus stearothermophilus, homologous to Asp44 in EcoNth is also involved in catalysis (29Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, neither the role of particular amino acids in substrate binding nor the evolution of the DNA glycosylases is understood in detail. Based on substitutions observed during natural sequence evolution (TABLE ONE) we have chosen site-directed EcoNth mutants to study the sequence basis of glycosylase specificity and lyase activity. Here we examine three such substitutions, EcoNth S39L, D44V, or R184A, that are in the vicinity of the substrate binding site (Fig. 1B). We show that EcoNth D44V retained glycosylase activity but had greatly reduced AP lyase activity relative to EcoNth. EcoNth S39L retained lyase activity but lacked glycosylase activity. Finally EcoNth R184A exhibited a qualitatively different substrate specificity from that of EcoNth.TABLE ONECorresponding conserved amino acids in EcoNth, EcoMutY, and BstNthHomologAmino acid residueEcoNth3944184EcoMutY4045189BstNth4045186 Open table in a new tab Phylogeny-based Scanning Mutagenesis—Proteins containing domains homologous to EcoNth were identified using BLAST family tools (30Wheeler D.L.

Occurrence of mutations associated with each aligned sequence position and edge was inferred by maximum parsimony using MacClade. One functional change was assumed to occur along the edge separating the Nth and MutY clades. Positions were identified at which substitutions were correlated with the functional change. A detailed description of phylogeny-based scanning mutagenesis is in preparation. Generation of the EcoNth Variants—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the PCR. A part of the nth gene on plasmid pET22b was amplified using primers purchased from Qiagen, which contained the site of the desired mutation. A fragment containing one part of the nth gene that had Ser39 substituted with Leu or Asp44 substituted with Val was ligated to a vector containing the other part of the nth gene with two PshA1 (New England Biolabs Inc.) sites. In the same manner, a PCR product containing one part of the nth gene that had Arg184 substituted with Ala was ligated to a vector containing the other part of the nth gene with two BspMI (New England Biolabs Inc.) sites. The direction of insertion was checked with BglII restriction enzyme (New England Bio-Labs Inc.). The DNA sequences of EcoNth S39L, D44V, and R184A were confirmed using an ABI 373 sequencer. Enzymes—EcoNth and three variants (S39L, D44V, or R184A) were overexpressed in E. coli strain ER2566 lacking Fpg proteins and harboring plasmid pET22b containing either the nth, nth s39l, nth d44v, or r184a genes tagged on the C terminus with hexahistidine. The E. coli strain harboring each plasmid was incubated for 20 h at 16 °C with 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were lysed with lysozyme (1 mg/ml, Gold Biotechnology), RNase (0.2 μg/ml, Sigma), and DNase (1.51 units/ml, Invitrogen) on ice for 1 h. The cell lysate was sonicated five times using an MSE sonicator for 1 min with a 3-min incubation on ice between each interval. After centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was purified with the AKTA system using a nickel column. The proteins were further purified with an SP column. Each enzyme was apparently homogenous as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Substrates—35-Base pair oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) and synthesized on either 0.2 or 1.0 μm scales in the following context: upper strand (5′-TGT CAA TAG CAA GXG GAG AAG TCA ATC GTG AGT CT-3′) and lower strand (3′-ACA GTT ATC GTT CYC CTC TTC AGT TAG CAC TCA GA-5′), where X = thymine glycol (Tg), 5-hydroxycytosine (5-OHC), 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU), dihydrouracil (DHU), dihydrothymine (DHT), or uracil and Y = adenine or guanine. For NaCNBH3 trapping, the same 35-base pair sequence was used. The upper strand was annealed to the lower strand in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl. The mixture was heated to 90 °C for 3 min and cooled slowly to room temperature. Abasic sites were generated by treating the 35-base pair duplexes containing U:G and U:A pairs with uracil DNA glycosylase in uracil DNA glycosylase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol; New England Biolabs Inc.). DNA Glycosylase/AP Lyase Assays—Substrates containing a Tg, 5-OHC, 5-OHU, DHU, DHT, or AP site (each 10 nm) were incubated with EcoNth or each variant (100 nm) in Reaction Buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 10 min. Some samples were mixed with gel loading buffer (0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20 mm EDTA, and 98% formamide) and heated at 90 °C for 5 min. To other samples 0.1 m NaOH was added before heating at 90 °C for 5 min followed by addition of gel loading buffer. All samples were heated at 90 °C for 2 min before loading. The reaction products were separated by 12% denaturing PAGE and analyzed with a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Enzyme Activity for Tg:A, Tg:G, DHU:A, and DHU:G—Substrates containing a Tg opposite A (10 nm) Tg opposite G (10 nm), DHU opposite A (10 nm) or a DHU opposite G (10 nm) were incubated with EcoNth or EcoNth R184A in Reaction Buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. For EcoNth, concentrations of: 0.0313, 0.0625, 0.25, 0.125, 0.5, 1, and 2 nm were used. For EcoNth R184A, concentrations of 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100 nm were used. Samples of EcoNth and R184A were then added to the gel loading buffer. All samples were heated at 90 °C for 2 min before loading. The reaction products were separated by 12% denaturing PAGE and analyzed with a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Multiple Turnover Kinetics—EcoNth (0.3 nm) was incubated in the presence of 5, 10, 20 and 50 nm Tg:A, Tg:G, DHU:A, or DHU:G at 37 °C. Each aliquot reaction was monitored after 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 min of incubation. R184A (10 nm) was incubated in the presence of 50, 100, and 200 nm Tg:A, Tg:G, DHU:A, or DHU:G at 37 °C. Each aliquot reaction was monitored after 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 min of incubation. Kinetic parameters were calculated by least squares regression of experimental data plotted as time versus product concentration using the program Dynafit (33Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Each regression was performed globally on three independent sets of data. The concentrations of enzyme and substrate were not optimized and had values as stated above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—32P-Labeled oligonucleotides containing an AP site were annealed to complementary strands containing either A or G across from the abasic site. A 1.25 nm concentration of the annealed substrate was incubated with either EcoNth, EcoNth S39L, EcoNth D44V, or EcoNth R184A at a final concentration of 10 nm in 25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol at 37 °C for 15 min. 5 μl of the sample was loaded onto a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25× TBE (22.5 mm Tris, 22.5 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and run at 300 volts for 90 min at 4 °C. The shifted 32P-labeled complexes and cleaved substrates were visualized by autoradiography. NaCNBH3 Trapping of Schiff Base Intermediates—EcoNth, EcoNth S39L, EcoNth D44V, or EcoNth R184A was incubated with substrates containing a DHU opposite G or an AP site opposite G in Reaction Buffer minus NaCl. Final enzyme concentrations were 50 nm. Reactions were performed in the presence of 50 mm NaCNH3 at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were then mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue) and heated to 90 °C for 5 min. The products were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Bifunctional Glycosylase/Lyase Activity—When DNA containing an oxidized pyrimidine (Tg, 5-OHC, 5-OHU, DHU, or DHT) was incubated with wild type EcoNth (Fig. 2A), significant cleavage of each of the substrates was detected. On the other hand, Fig. 2A shows that in the absence of NaOH no significant cleavage by EcoNth S39L or EcoNth D44V was observed for any substrate tested. Denaturing gel analysis of the cleaved products produced by EcoNth R184A on a substrate containing DHU opposite G showed that the glycosylase/lyase activity (Fig. 2A, lane 20) was similar to that of EcoNth (lane 17). However, the activity of EcoNth R184A for Tg, 5-OHC, 5-OHU, and DHT (lanes 5, 10, 15, and 25) was much lower compared with that of EcoNth (lanes 2, 7, 12, and 22). Like wild type EcoNth, R184A yielded a β-elimination product. Monofunctional Glycosylase Activity—The absence of substrate cleavage by EcoNth S39L or D44V is consistent with loss of glycosylase activity, loss of lyase activity, or loss of both activities. To directly determine glycosylase activity, S39L and D44V reactions were treated with sodium hydroxide to cleave any abasic sites. Fig. 2B shows the reactions of substrates containing an oxidized pyrimidine (Tg, 5-OHC, 5-OHU, DHU, and DHT) incubated with either wild type EcoNth or the three EcoNth variants followed by treatment with NaOH. The amount of β-elimination product for EcoNth without or with NaOH was similar (Fig. 2, A and B) as expected for a bifunctional glycosylase/lyase. EcoNth S39L did not cleave substrate even after addition of NaOH to the reacted samples (Fig. 2B). Thus it appears that S39L lost glycosylase activity on the oxidized pyrimidine substrates tested although substrates containing an AP site opposite A or G were cleaved by S39L (Fig. 3A). In contrast when NaOH was added to the reaction product after incubation with EcoNth D44V, cleavage was readily detected (Fig. 2B). Thus D44V retained monofunctional glycosylase activity producing an AP site after removing the oxidized pyrimidine. In keeping with this observation, when DNA containing an AP site opposite G or A was incubated with D44V (Fig. 3A), cleavage was substantially reduced compared with wild type EcoNth (compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 7 and 9). The same results were obtained when a time course was measured for wild type EcoNth and D44V (Fig. 3B), which showed about a 5-fold reduction in lyase activity compared with wild type. The defect in D44V appears to be in catalysis, since analysis by electroporetic mobility shift (Fig. 3C) shows that EcoNth D44V efficiently bound to a substrate containing an AP site but failed to cleave it. These data substantiate that substitution of valine for aspartic acid greatly reduced the lyase activity of the enzyme and support the hypothesis that Asp 44 is important for the lyase activity of EcoNth. As expected, addition of NaOH to R184A reactions did not affect the amount of product produced for any substrates tested (Fig. 2B) showing that R184A retained its bifunctional character. Enzyme Activity of Wild Type EcoNth and EcoNth R184A for Tg:A, Tg:G, DHU:A, or DHU:G—Wild type EcoNth or EcoNth R184A was incubated with substrates containing Tg:A, Tg:G, DHU:A, and DHU:G and the products analyzed by denaturing PAGE. The amount of nicked product produced was plotted as a function of enzyme concentration. Fig. 4A shows that under multiple turnover conditions and at low concentrations of enzyme, wild type EcoNth efficiently cleaved Tg:A, Tg:G, and DHU:G, but DHU:A was a much poorer substrate (see also TABLE TWO). Fig. 4B shows that for EcoNth R184A, under conditions of enzyme excess, cleavage of both Tg:G- and DHU:G-containing substrates was observed but poor cleavage was found with both Tg:A- and DHU:A-containing substrates. Thus pairing of Tg or DHU with A greatly reduced the efficiency of cleavage by EcoNth R184A. This observation was substantiated by kinetic analysis of EcoNth and EcoNth R184A on the same substrates (TABLE TWO). The significant difference in kcat/Km between wild type EcoNth and R184A is dominated by a large increase in Km. We note that, although visual analysis of the substrate cleavage measurements revealed a striking difference in kcat/Km between damaged bases opposite A or G, the large increase in Km makes it technically difficult to saturate the enzyme with substrate and obtain accurate estimates of kcat. Therefore, the relatively small increase in kcat may not be significant.TABLE TWOKinetic analysis of EcoNth and EcoNth R184A on substrates containing thymine glycol or dihydrouracilKmkcatkcat/Kmnmmin−1×102EcoNthTg·A9.75.961Tg·G5.94.576DHU·A9.11.820DHU·G3.62.672EcoNth R184ATg·A40005.90.15Tg·G1920965.0DHU·A140,000820.06DHU·G133107.5 Open table in a new tab Formation of a Schiff Base Intermediate—Stable covalent DNA-enzyme Schiff base intermediates are formed with an active amine residue of a bifunctional glycosylase/lyase by reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or sodium cyanoborohydride (NaCNBH3) (3David S.S. Williams S.D. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1221-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 34Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the formation of such covalent adducts has been demonstrated for EcoNth (35Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To determine whether EcoNth S39L, D44V, and R184A were able to form a Schiff base, the enzymes were incubated with a substrate containing a DHU opposite G or an AP site opposite G in the presence or absence of NaCNBH3 and the cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 5 shows that EcoNth D44V and R184A (and EcoNth), but not S39L, formed covalent DNA-enzyme adducts with DHU-containing oligonucleotides. All three variants formed the Schiff base adducts with AP site-containing oligonucleotides in the presence of NaCNBH3. It is usual to informally classify amino acids in enzymes as having roles, if any, in reaction chemistry, enzyme structure, and substrate specificity. For example, in EcoNth Lys120 is involved in reaction chemistry because it forms a Schiff base with the substrate, and lysines are observed at homologous positions in HhH-GPD superfamily enzymes having lyase activity. In contrast, EcoNth Gly116 and Gly118 are presumed to be important for helix-hairpin-helix structure and are highly conserved throughout the HhH-GPD superfamily. However, identification of amino acids having roles in specificity is much harder, and very little is known about the sequence basis of EcoNth specificity. The fundamental problem is in strategically selecting substitutions that will alter specificity without eliminating activity altogether. Since evolution of paralogous proteins is such a selection procedure, our approach is to take advantage of natural sequence phylogenies of the HhH-GPD super-family. This approach succeeds when few site-directed mutations result in either unchanged activities or complete loss of activity. In this study three out of three site-directed mutations exhibited functional differences that could be understood in the context of EcoNth structure. What do the extant crystal structures tell us about the amino acids selected by phylogenetic analysis? In the B. stearothermophilus Nth-DNA complex (29Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), Ser40, homologous to EcoNth Ser39, does not appear to have any contacts with the DNA backbone, solvent, or the ring-opened sugar, but in the modeled active site, Ser40 is positioned to interact with the damaged base (data not shown). The corresponding Leu40 in MutY interacts with the adenine face in the MutY-DNA complex (36Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The EcoNth S39L mutation studied here has lost its glycosylase activity while maintaining lyase activity (Figs. 2 and 3). The loss of glycosylase activity could be due to steric interference resulting from the larger size of leucine, the loss of a hydroxyl group, or both of these changes. Fromme and Verdine (29Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) predicted that an Asp45, homologous to Asp44 in EcoNth, would play an essential role in Bacillus stearother- mophilus Nth lyase activity by abstracting a hydrogen from the C2′ position of the damaged nucleotide, catalyzing β-elimination. Our data support the proposed role of Asp44 in catalysis, since EcoNth D44V both binds to (Fig. 3C) and forms a Schiff base (Fig. 5) with DNA containing an AP site. Furthermore, EcoNth D44V retains glycosylase activity but has greatly reduced lyase activity (Figs. 2 and 3). The x-ray structures of B. stearothermophilus Nth-DNA complexes (29Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) showed that Asp45 appears to hydrogen-bond a water molecule that is near the Pro-R proton at C2′. The authors (29Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) proposed that this water and Asp45 shuttle the Pro-R proton catalyzing β-elimination, consistent with their observation that B. stearothermophilus Nth removes the Pro-R proton with 97% selectivity. The corresponding Val45 in the MutY protein is in the minor groove reading frame of the protein. Notably a MutY V45N mutation eliminates glycosylase activity (36Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Guan et al. (36Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) postulate that MutY V45N loses activity because it disrupts adenine nucleotide flipping into the active site. Although our results with D44V are in agreement with the prediction of Fromme and Verdine (29Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), they raise two questions. First, as these authors point out, it has been reported that EcoNth removes the Pro-S proton (37Mazumder A. Gerlt J.A. Absalon M.J. Stubbe J. Cunningham R.P. Withka J. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1119-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Second, although MutY does not exhibit lyase activity, a site-directed mutant having a lysine homologous to EcoNth Lys120 does exhibit significant lyase activity in the absence of an aspartate homologous to EcoNth Asp44 (38Williams S.D. David S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10098-10109Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Vassylyev et al. (39Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) suggest that Glu23 of T4-endo V could participate in the lyase activity of this protein by abstracting the Pro-S hydrogen at the C2′ position. Correspondingly, in the MutY variant, S120K, abstraction of the hydrogen at the C2′ position may be mediated by Glu37, which is in the vicinity of the active site of MutY and is not conserved in EcoNth. Although the lyase activity of EcoNth D44V was substantially reduced compared with the wild type enzyme, D44V did exhibit a low level of lyase activity (Fig. 3). In this case, Glu23 of EcoNth D44V, which is in vicinity of the active site of EcoNth, might abstract the C2′ proton albeit with significantly lower efficiency. In the structure of BstNth (29Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) Arg186, homologous to EcoNth Arg184, hydrogen-bonds to the 5′ oxygen of the AP site and to Glu24, homologous to EcoNth Glu23. EcoNth Arg184 is also positioned to interact with the damaged base (data not shown). Interestingly, R184A retains both glycosylase and lyase activity, but its interaction with substrates containing thymine glycol and dihydrouracil is different from that of wild type EcoNth. Arg184 appears to be critical for recognition or catalysis of substrates containing Tg or DHU paired with A because R184A cleaves these substrates poorly (Figs. 2A and 4B); however, R184A can cleave both lesions opposite G (Fig. 4B). Since Arg184 is not positioned to interact directly with the base opposite the damage, these results suggest that EcoNth Arg184 plays an indirect role in substrate specificity through a direct role in positioning/stabilizing the substrate via interaction with the 5′ oxygen of the damaged base. Nth orthologs have been shown to exhibit an opposite guanine preference (16Asagoshi K. Odawara H. Nakano H. Miyano T. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Seki S. Ide H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11389-11398Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 40Eide L. Luna L. Gustad E.C. Henderson P.T. Essigmann J.M. Demple B. Seeberg E.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of the Nth-DNA complex shows the enzyme to make more contacts with estranged G than estranged A (29Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We propose that Arg184 partially compensates for relatively poor binding to adenine opposite a damaged base. In summary, previous studies have focused on Lys120 and Asp138 as the key catalytic residues in Nth orthologs. Our results, in combination with the analysis provided by Fromme and Verdine (29Fromme J.C. Verdine G.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), show that Asp44 plays an important role in the AP lyase step of EcoNth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ser39 is involved in base recognition or binding, while Arg184 also plays a role in substrate specificity and is possibly involved with opposite base specificity. This study illustrates the utility of “phylogenetic scans” in designing sets of site directed mutations based on identification of sequence-function correlations in sets of homologous proteins to delineate the role of specific amino acids in enzyme/substrate interactions. We are grateful to Wendy Cooper for purifying proteins and to the Vermont Cancer Center DNA Facility for sequencing the constructs."

The biochemical role of these proteins in T lymphocytes is not well known. Here we have studied the role of protein-tyrosine kinase ZAP 70, a key enzyme involved in the proximal signaling events during T cell activation, in the modulation of RXRE- and RARE-dependent activation in T lymphocytes. Surprisingly, ZAP 70-negative Jurkat T cells showed considerable loss of both RXRE- and RARE-mediated transactivation as compared with wild type Jurkat cells. In addition, ZAP 70-negative cells failed to exhibit normal protein kinase C θ and calcineurin-induced transcriptional activity. ZAP 70-negative cells that were reconstituted with active ZAP 70 regained the transactivation function, whereas cells expressing kinase-dead form of ZAP 70 failed to do so. Defective transcriptional activation was also observed in actively proliferating human peripheral blood T lymphocytes in which RNA interference was used to induce loss of ZAP 70 expression. In addition, an Lck-deficient Jurkat cell line that cannot efficiently activate ZAP 70 was also found defective in RXRE-mediated transcription. Finally, RNA interference-induced loss of ZAP 70 or Lck protein in Jurkat cells resulted in significant decrease in the RXRE-dependent activation.

One of the earliest events is the activation of Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK) Lck and/or Fyn that phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of the TCR. This creates the docking site for an SH2 domain containing PTK called ZAP 70. ZAP 70 binds to two phosphotyrosine residues of individual ITAMs and is subsequently phosphorylated and activated by Lck and/or Fyn (5Latour S. Veillette A. Curr. Opin.

In addition, activated PKCθ was found to synergize with calcineurin to induce transcriptional activation mediated by these receptors (18Ishaq M. Fan M. Wigmore K. Gaddam A. Natarajan V. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the role of proximal TCR signaling events and the activation of PTK in the modulation of retinoid receptor-dependent transcription is not known. Here we have shown that ZAP 70-negative Jurkat cells, T cells manipulated to express low levels of ZAP 70, or cells that cannot efficiently activate ZAP 70 exhibit loss of retinoid receptor-mediated transactivation suggesting that ZAP 70 is essential for normal retinoid receptor function in T cells. Cells and Other Reagents—T lymphocyte leukemia Jurkat cell line (clone E6-1) and Lck-deficient Jurkat cell line J.CaM1.6 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). ZAP 70-negative Jurkat cell line P116, P116 cells stably expressing c-myc-tagged wild type ZAP 70 (P116/pWT), and P116 cells stably expressing c-myc-tagged kinase-dead ZAP 70 mutant (K369R) (P116/pDK) (19Williams B.L.

Wange (National Institutes of Health, Baltimore). These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Biowhittaker, Frederick, MD) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES buffer, 2 mm l-glutamine, 60 μg/ml gentamicin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, obtained by lymphapheresis of healthy donors, were purified by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2 for 2 days in AIM-V medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed to remove phytohemagglutinin and maintained in interleukin-2. In this report, these cells will be referred to as proliferating peripheral blood T (PBT) cells. PBT cells were 98% CD3-positive as monitored by flow cytometry. 9-cis-Retinoic acid (9-CRA) and all-trans-retinoic acid were from Sigma and were used at 1 μm. ZAP 70 and Lck antibodies were from BD Biosciences, and RARα, RXRα, and c-myc tag antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Western Blot—Nuclear and cytoplasmic isolations were performed with the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic kit from Pierce as per the manufacturer's instructions. Protein extracts were electrophoresced in a 10% NuPAGE BisTris gel using NuPAGE MES-SDS running buffer (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using XCell Blot Module (Invitrogen). The protein was detected using the fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies and Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-cor Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE). Transfections and RNA Interference (RNAi)—RXRE-, RARE-, TRE-, and VDRE-driven transcriptional activation was studied by transfection using luciferase based reporter plasmids TKCRBPII-Luc, TKRARE-Luc, TKDR4-Luc, and TKDR3-Luc, respectively, as described previously (17Ishaq M. DeGray G. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39296-39302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The TKCRBPIIM-Luc plasmid containing RXRE mutant sequence (17Ishaq M. DeGray G. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39296-39302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was used as RXR specificity control. Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter that lacks an RXRE or RARE site was isolated by PCR and cloned into pGL3-Luc basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmids expressing human RXRα, RARα, TRα, and VDR were as described (17Ishaq M. DeGray G. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39296-39302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). pCEFL vector, pCEFL/dominant active protein kinase Cθ (DA-PKCθ), and dominant active calcineurin (DACN) have been described previously (18Ishaq M. Fan M. Wigmore K. Gaddam A. Natarajan V. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The psX/ZAP70 plasmid obtained from Dr. R. L. Wange (National Institutes of Health, Baltimore) was used as template to isolate ZAP 70 cDNA by PCR for cloning in pcDNA4/HisMaxTOPO vector (Invitrogen). ZAP 70 and Lck SMARTpool siRNAs were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Jurkat and Jurkat-derived cells were transfected by electroporation using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 0.250 kV and 975 microfarads as described (18Ishaq M. Fan M. Wigmore K. Gaddam A. Natarajan V. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PBT cells were electroporated using a T cell Nucleofection kit from Amaxa Biosystems (Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and harvested at the indicated time periods, and luciferase activity was determined using Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to protein concentrations in the extracts. The values in the figures represent the mean of two to three independent experiments with standard error calculated for each value. Defective RXR- and RAR-mediated Transactivation in ZAP 70-negative Jurkat Cells—Our earlier reports have shown that Jurkat cells have functional RXR- and RAR-dependent transcriptional machinery that can be regulated by a number of signaling pathways (16Ishaq M. Fan M. Natarajan V. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4217-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Ishaq M. DeGray G. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39296-39302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 18Ishaq M. Fan M. Wigmore K. Gaddam A. Natarajan V. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To dissect the role of ZAP 70 kinase in modulating RXR and RAR-dependent gene activation, we used a ZAP 70-negative cell line named P116. This cell line has been generated from wild type Jurkat E6 cells by mutagenesis using the frameshift mutagen, ICR-191 (19Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Wild type Jurkat cells and P116 cells were transfected with TKCRBPII-Luc reporter, which binds RXR either as homodimer or heterodimer with RAR, in the presence or absence of RXRα expressing plasmid and 9-CRA. Surprisingly, P116 cells were considerably defective in supporting transcription from TKCRBPII-Luc plasmid as compared with the wild type Jurkat cells. This defect was observed with endogenous as well as exogenously expressed RXRα and was independent of the presence or absence of the 9-CRA (Fig. 1A). We also tested TKRARE-Luc reporter plasmid, containing DR5 element from RARβ2 promoter specific for RXR/RAR heterodimerdependent transcription. Similar to TKCRBPII-Luc, there was a marked reduction in the transcription driven by TKRARE-Luc plasmid in P116 cells as compared with wild type Jurkat cells. As a control, luciferase activity driven by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter, which lacks an RXRE or RARE site, did not show any significant reduction in P116 cells. Little or no luciferase activity was observed when cells were transfected with TKCRBPII-M-Luc, a plasmid containing mutations in RXRE site, indicating the specificity of retinoid receptor-dependent activation assay. Under similar conditions reporter activities driven by TKDR3-Luc and TKDR4-Luc, specific for RXR/VDR- and RXR/TR-mediated activation respectively, were not reduced in P116 cells as compared with wild type cells. Together, these results indicate that ZAP 70 expression is essential for RXR-dependent transcriptional activation either as homodimer or heterodimer with RAR but is not crucial for transcriptional activation involving heterodimerization with TR and VDR. This selectivity for RAR containing heterodimers is striking and is indicative of specific role of ZAP 70 to modulate retinoid receptor function in T cells. RXRα and RARα are two major isoforms of RXRs and RARs in T cells mostly located in nuclear compartments. To exclude the possibility that the loss of retinoid receptor activity in P116 cells is due either to the loss of expression of one or both of these receptor proteins or export to cytoplasmic compartment, we investigated whether wild type Jurkat and P116 cells express comparable levels of RARα and RXRα proteins in their nuclear compartments. Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B) indicates that wild type Jurkat and P116 cells express similar levels of RARα and RXRα protein in the nuclear compartments. Furthermore, RARα and RXRα proteins were not detected in cytoplasmic compartments. These results indicate that the absence of ZAP 70 does not alter the localization of receptor proteins in the cell and instead suggest the role of ZAP 70 in a post-translational mechanism that regulates receptor activity in Jurkat cells. P116 cells have been reported to be defective in PKCθ signaling (20Herndon T.M. Shan X.C. Tsokos G.C. Wange R.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 66: 5654-5664Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that expression of DA-CN and DA-PKCθ synergistically induce RXRE-dependent transcription in Jurkat cells (18Ishaq M. Fan M. Wigmore K. Gaddam A. Natarajan V. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether this PKCθ and CN synergism can be observed in P116 cells. Wild type Jurkat cells and P116 cells were transfected with TKCRBPII-Luc or TKRARE-Luc plasmid in the presence or absence of pCEFL vector or pCEFL/DA-PKCθ or a combination of pCEFL vector and DA-CN or pCEFL/DA-PKCθ and DA-CN plasmids. We expected that the expression of DA-PKCθ and DA-CN would circumvent the need for ZAP 70 expression to support RXRE- and RARE-mediated activation in P116 cells. Surprisingly, P116 cells exhibit considerably low DA-PKCθ/DA-CN-induced receptor-dependent activation contrary to wild type Jurkat cells that showed a robust DAPKCθ and DA-CN synergism (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that defective PKCθ signaling due to lack of ZAP 70 expression in P116 cells may not alone be responsible for low transcriptional activity in these cells. ZAP 70 (possibly nuclear ZAP 70) may play an additional role independent of PKCθ and CN in modulating RXRE- and RARE-mediated activity. Since similar data were obtained with RXRE and RARE containing reporter vectors subsequent experiments have been performed with TKCRBPII-Luc vector alone. Enzymatically Active ZAP 70 Expression Reconstitutes RXRE-mediated Transactivation in P116 Cells—To determine whether defective RXRE signaling in ZAP 70-negative P116 cells can be corrected by the expression of enzymatically active ZAP 70, we studied P116 cells transiently expressing ZAP 70 protein and P116 cells stably expressing the enzyme. P116 cells were transfected with TKCRBPII-Luc plasmid in the presence or absence of pcDNA4/HisMaxTOPO vector or ZAP 70 expressing pcDNA4/HisMaxTOPO/ZAP 70 plasmid (Fig. 2A). Transfection of P116 cells with ZAP70 expressing plasmid reconstituted RXRE activity significantly as compared with cells transfected with vector (Fig. 2B) indicating that expression of ZAP 70 is important for normal RXRE activity. These data also excludes the possibility that lower reporter activity in P116 cells may have partly been due to the lower transfection efficiency of these cells as compared with wild type cells. Previous studies have shown that P116 cells that stably express wild type ZAP 70 regain most of the phosphorylation events whereas mutant ZAP 70 reconstituted cells fail to do so (19Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We investigated whether P116 cells that stably express wild type ZAP 70 or catalytically inactive mutant (K369R) of ZAP 70 were able to support RXRE-dependent activation. Transfection of P116/pWT cells with TKCRBPII-Luc plasmid yielded activation levels that closely approached the levels seen in wild type Jurkat cells. In contrast, transfection of P116/pDK cells with TKCRBPII-Luc plasmid yielded activity levels that were similar to the levels obtained with P116 cells (Fig. 2C). We next studied the DA-PKCθ/DA-CN synergism-induced RXRE activity in enzymatically active ZAP 70 reconstituted P116 cells and P116 cells that were reconstituted with catalytically inactive ZAP 70. Fig. 2C shows that contrary to catalytically inactive ZAP 70 reconstituted P116 cells that showed low PKCθ/CN-induced transcriptional activity, enzymatically active ZAP 70 reconstituted cells regained most of PKCθ/CN-induced the RXRE-dependent transcription. Together, these results demonstrate that PTK activity of ZAP 70 can correct the defects in basal as well as PKCθ/CN-induced RXRE-dependent signaling in P116 cells unlike catalytically inactive ZAP 70 that fails to restore receptor activity in these cells. RNAi-induced Loss of ZAP 70 Expression Interferes in RXRE-dependent Transactivation—To extrapolate the data obtained with P116 cells to a more physiologic model for T cell function, we used normal human PBT cells in which ZAP 70 expression was partially knocked down by RNAi. siRNA duplexes specific for human ZAP 70 mRNA were introduced into PBT cells using a Nucleofection kit from Amaxa Biosystems. This method of transfection resulted in more than 75% loss in ZAP 70 protein expression in these cells (Fig. 3A). To determine the role of ZAP 70 in RXRE-dependent function in PBT cells, they were transfected with TKCRBPII-Luc in the presence or absence of ZAP 70-specific siRNA or a nonspecific scrambled RNA. The results show that ZAP 70 specific siRNA considerably attenuated RXRE-mediated transcription whereas scrambled RNA did not have significant effect on the transcription (Fig. 3B). We also used RNAi to knock down nearly 90% of ZAP 70 protein expression in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3A). Transfection of Jurkat cells with TKCRBPII-Luc in the presence of ZAP 70 specific siRNA resulted in a significant down-regulation of RXRE-dependent transcription in these cells, whereas scrambled RNA did not show significant effect on transcription (Fig. 3B). RNAi data further confirm the essential role of ZAP 70 in mediating RXRE activity in Jurkat cells and indicate that ZAP 70-dependent RXRE regulation is also operative in normal human peripheral blood T cell pool. Lck-deficient Jurkat Cells Are Defective in RXRE-dependent Transcription—In addition to being important for binding of ZAP 70 to ITAM, Lck is required for phosphorylation and activation of ZAP 70 (1Huang Y. Wange R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28827-28830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Pitcher L.A. van Oers N.S. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 554-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 4Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that the lack of Lck expression could compromise RXRE-dependent transcription due to the lack of active ZAP 70. Wild type Jurkat cells and Lck-deficient JCam 1.6 cells were transfected with TKCRBPII-Luc plasmid in the presence or absence of RXRα expressing plasmid and 9-CRA. The results (Fig. 4 A) indicate a considerable decrease in RXRE activity in JCam 1.6 cells as compared with wild type Jurkat cells. These data show that Lck is essential for the RXRE-mediated transcription. Additional evidence that Lck plays an important role in RXRE-mediated transcription was obtained by experiments involving RNAi-induced loss of Lck expression in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells transfected with Lck-specific siRNA duplexes resulted in about 75% loss of Lck protein (Fig. 4B). Transfection of Jurkat cells with TKCRBPII-Luc in the presence or absence of Lck-specifcic siRNA or nonspecific siRNA showed that while nonspecific siRNA had no effect on the RXRE activity, Lck-specific siRNA attenuated RXRE-dependent transcription (Fig. 4C). The role of nuclear receptor mediated gene expression in the normal functioning of T cells has remained elusive. It is increasingly becoming clear that epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in defining the retinoid receptor-dependent function during T cell signaling (Fig. 5). It is, however, not clear how overlapping signaling intermediates modulate either activation or inhibition of receptor function resulting in outcomes as diverse as cell division, proliferation, development, stress response, homeostasis, and apoptosis. In T cells ZAP 70 is not only present in cytoplasm (for translocation to TCR following T cell activation), but the protein is also localized in the nucleus (Ref. 21Sloan-Lancaster J.S. Zhang W. Presley J. Williams B.L. Abraham R.T. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Samelson L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1713-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and Fig. 1B) where its function is unknown. Whether cytoplasmic or nuclear ZAP 70 or both play a role in modulating RXRE and RARE mediated transcription remains to be seen. RXRα has a number of tyrosine phosphorylation sites that are important for its transcriptional activity in Jurkat cells. 3M. Ishaq and V. Natarajan, unpublished data. However, ZAP 70 failed to phosphorylate recombinant RXRα in direct phosphorylation studies (data not shown). Whether ZAP 70 is involved in the phosphorylation RARα remains to be studied. ZAP 70-mediated phosphorylation of RARα may play essential role in the transcriptional activity of this receptor. ZAP 70 is essential for phosphorylation and activation of number of downstream protein kinases (5Latour S. Veillette A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 6Van Oers N.S. Killeen N. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 22Saxena M. Mustelin T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and phosphatases (23Alonso A. Rahmouni S. Williams S. Stipdonk M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Abraham R.T. Schoenberger S.P. Mustelin T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in addition to its essential role in the translocation of PKCθ to the lipid rafts during the formation of functional immune synapse. We have previously shown that RXRE activity is modulated by PKCθ, CN, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (16Ishaq M. Fan M. Natarajan V. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4217-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Ishaq M. Fan M. Wigmore K. Gaddam A. Natarajan V. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). RXRE and RARE transactivation may involve modulation of one or all of these signaling pathways by ZAP 70. The finding that the expression of a combination of DA-PKCθ and DA-CN failed to restore RARE and RXRE activity in P116 cells indicates that ZAP 70 regulation of retinoid receptor activity may also involve PKCθ-independent pathways. Deficient transcriptional activation in J.CaM1.6 cells provides further evidence for the important role of proximal signaling events, involving ZAP 70 and its upstream kinase Lck, in the retinoid receptor signaling in T cells. This study, however, does not rule out the possibility that Lck could modulate receptor activity independent of ZAP 70. In summary, we report a novel function of ZAP 70 in human T cells that links proximal signaling events with transcriptional machinery selectively driven by retinoid receptors in the nucleus. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of such selectivity and the physiological importance in T cell function. We thank Drs. R. L Wange, S. Shaw, K. Ozato, and R.
