https://openalex.org/W2962981403,"Effective ocean management and the conservation of highly migratory species depend on resolving the overlap between animal movements and distributions, and fishing effort. However, this information is lacking at a global scale. Here we show, using a big-data approach that combines satellite-tracked movements of pelagic sharks and global fishing fleets, that 24% of the mean monthly space used by sharks falls under the footprint of pelagic longline fisheries. Space-use hotspots of commercially valuable sharks and of internationally protected species had the highest overlap with longlines (up to 76% and 64%, respectively), and were also associated with significant increases in fishing effort. We conclude that pelagic sharks have limited spatial refuge from current levels of fishing effort in marine areas beyond national jurisdictions (the high seas). Our results demonstrate an urgent need for conservation and management measures at high-seas hotspots of shark space use, and highlight the potential of simultaneous satellite surveillance of megafauna and fishers as a tool for near-real-time, dynamic management."
https://openalex.org/W2963146858,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are thought to be important in cell-cell communication and have elicited extraordinary interest as potential biomarkers of disease. However, quantitative methods to enable elucidation of mechanisms underlying release are few. Here, we describe a cell-based assay for monitoring EV release using the EV-enriched tetraspanin CD63 fused to the small, ATP-independent reporter enzyme, Nanoluciferase. Release of CD63-containing EVs from stably expressing cell lines was monitored by comparing luciferase activity in culture media to that remaining in cells. HEK293, U2OS, U87 and SKMel28 cells released 0.3%-0.6% of total cellular CD63 in the form of EVs over 5 hrs, varying by cell line. To identify cellular machinery important for secretion of CD63-containing EVs, we performed a screen of biologically active chemicals in HEK293 cells. While a majority of compounds did not significantly affect EV release, treating cells with the plecomacrolides bafilomycin or concanamycin, known to inhibit the V-ATPase, dramatically increased EV release. Interestingly, alkalization of the endosomal lumen using weak bases had no effect, suggesting a pH-independent enhancement of EV release by V-ATPase inhibitors. The ability to quantify EVs in small samples will enable future detailed studies of release kinetics as well as further chemical and genetic screening to define pathways involved in EV secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2963311357,"Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, have a circumpolar distribution but are concentrated within the south-west Atlantic sector, where they support a unique food web and a commercial fishery. Within this sector, our first goal was to produce quantitative distribution maps of all six ontogenetic life stages of krill (eggs, nauplii plus metanauplii, calyptopes, furcilia, juveniles, and adults), based on a compilation of all available post 1970s data. Using these maps, we then examined firstly whether “hotspots” of egg production and early stage nursery occurred, and secondly whether the available habitat was partitioned between the successive life stages during the austral summer and autumn, when krill densities can be high. To address these questions, we compiled larval krill density records and extracted data spanning 41 years (1976–2016) from the existing KRILLBASE-abundance and KRILLBASE-length-frequency databases. Although adult males and females of spawning age were widely distributed, the distribution of eggs, nauplii and metanauplii indicates that spawning is most intense over the shelf and shelf slope. This contrasts with the distributions of calyptope and furcilia larvae, which were concentrated further offshore, mainly in the Southern Scotia Sea. Juveniles, however, were strongly concentrated over shelves along the Scotia Arc. Simple environmental analyses based on water depth and mean water temperature suggest that krill associate with different habitats over the course of their life cycle. From the early to late part of the austral season, juvenile distribution moves from ocean to shelf, opposite in direction to that for adults. Such habitat partitioning may reduce intraspecific competition for food, which has been suggested to occur when densities are exceptionally high during years of strong recruitment. It also prevents any potential cannibalism by adults on younger stages. Understanding the location of krill spawning and juvenile development in relation to potentially overlapping fishing activities is needed to protect the health of the south-west Atlantic sector ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2962827549,"Sunscreens and other personal care products use organic ultraviolet (UV) filters such as oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate to prevent damage to human skin. While these compounds are effective at preventing sunburn, they have a demonstrated negative effect on cells and tissues across taxonomic levels. These compounds have a relatively short half-life in seawater but are continuously re-introduced via recreational activities and wastewater discharge, making them environmentally persistent. Because of this, testing seawater samples for the presence of these compounds may not be reflective of their abundance in the environment. Bioaccumulation of organic ultraviolet filters in a high-trophic level predator may provide greater insight to the presence and persistence of these compounds. To address this, the present study collected seawater samples as well as muscle and stomach content samples from the invasive Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans) in the nearshore waters of Grenada, West Indies to examine the use of lionfish as potential bioindicator species. Seawater and lionfish samples were collected at four sites that are near point sources of wastewater discharge and that receive a high number of visitors each year. Samples were tested for the presence and concentrations of oxybenzone, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), Padimate-O, and octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Oxybenzone residues were detected in 60% of seawater samples and OMC residues were detected in 20% of seawater samples. Seawater samples collected in the surface waters near Grenada’s main beach had oxybenzone concentrations more than ten times higher than seawater samples collected in less frequently visited areas and the highest prevalence of UV filters in lionfish. Residues of oxybenzone were detected in 35% of lionfish muscle and 4-MBC residues were detected in 12% of lionfish muscle. Padimate-O was not detected in either seawater or lionfish samples. No organic UV filters were detected in lionfish stomach contents. Histopathologic examination of lionfish demonstrated no significant findings attributed to UV filter toxicity. These findings report UV filter residue levels for the first time in inshore waters in Grenada. Results indicate that lionfish may be bioaccumulating residues and may be a useful sentinel model for monitoring organic ultraviolet filters in the Caribbean Sea."
https://openalex.org/W2963331372,"Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a disorder characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscular atrophy. In the majority of cases, SMA is caused by the homozygous absence of the SMN1 gene. The disease severity of SMA is strongly influenced by the copy number of the closely related SMN2 gene. In addition, an SMN variant lacking exons 7 and 8 has been reported in 8% and 23% of healthy Swedish and Spanish individuals respectively. We tested 1255 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project using a new version of the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) P021 probemix that covers each SMN exon. The SMN variant lacking exons 7 and 8 was present in up to 20% of individuals in several Caucasian populations, while being almost completely absent in various Asian and African populations. This SMN1/2Δ7–8 variant appears to be derived from an ancient deletion event as the deletion size is identical in 99% of samples tested. The average total copy number of SMN1, SMN2 and the SMN1/2Δ7–8 variant combined was remarkably comparable in all populations tested, ranging from 3.64 in Asian to 3.75 in African samples."
https://openalex.org/W2963741794,"Downscaled climate projections need to be linked to downscaled projections of population and economic growth to fully develop implications for land, natural resources, and ecosystems for future scenarios. We develop an empirical spatiotemporal approach for jointly projecting population and income at the county scale in the United States that is consistent with neoclassical economic growth theory and overlapping labor markets and that accounts for labor migration and spatial spillovers. Downscaled projections generated for the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways used to support global scenario analysis generally show growth focused around relatively few centers especially in the southeast and western regions, with some areas in the Midwest and northeast experiencing population declines. Results are consistent with economic growth theory and with historical trends in population change and convergence of per capita personal income across US counties."
https://openalex.org/W2963928659,"Knowledge on the trophic interactions among predators and their prey is important in order to understand ecology and behaviour of animals. Traditionally studies on the diet composition of insectivorous bats have been based on the morphological identification of prey remains, but the accuracy of the results has been hampered due to methodological limitations. Lately, the DNA metabarcoding and High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) techniques have changed the scene since they allows prey identification to the species level, ultimately giving more precision to the results. Nevertheless, the use of one single primer set to amplify faecal DNA produces biases in the assessed dietary composition. Three horseshoe bats overlap extensively in their distribution range in Europe: Rhinolophus euryale, R. hipposideros and R. ferrumequinum. In order to achieve the deepest insight on their prey list we combined two different primers. Results showed that the used primers were complementary at the order and species levels, only 22 out of 135 prey species being amplified by both. The most frequent prey of R. hipposideros belonged to Diptera and Lepidoptera, to Lepidoptera in R. euryale, and Lepidoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera in R. ferrumequinum. The three bats show significant resource partitioning, since their trophic niche overlap is not higher than 34%. Our results confirm the importance of combining complementary primers to describe the diet of generalist insectivorous bats with amplicon metabarcoding techniques. Overall, each primer set showed a subset of the prey composition, with a small portion of the total prey being identified by both of them. Therefore, each primer presented a different picture of the niche overlap among the three horseshoe bats due to their taxonomic affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2963668407,"The island of New Guinea hosts the third largest expanse of tropical rainforest on the planet. Papua New Guinea—comprising the eastern half of the island—plans to nearly double its national road network (from 8,700 to 15,000 km) over the next three years, to spur economic growth. We assessed these plans using fine-scale biophysical and environmental data. We identified numerous environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with these projects, including the dissection of 54 critical biodiversity habitats and diminished forest connectivity across large expanses of the island. Key habitats of globally endangered species including Goodfellow’s tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus goodfellowi), Matchie’s tree kangaroo (D. matschiei), and several birds of paradise would also be bisected by roads and opened up to logging, hunting, and habitat conversion. Many planned roads would traverse rainforests and carbon-rich peatlands, contradicting Papua New Guinea’s international commitments to promote low-carbon development and forest conservation for climate-change mitigation. Planned roads would also create new deforestation hotspots via rapid expansion of logging, mining, and oil-palm plantations. Our study suggests that several planned road segments in steep and high-rainfall terrain would be extremely expensive in terms of construction and maintenance costs. This would create unanticipated economic challenges and public debt. The net environmental, social, and economic risks of several planned projects—such as the Epo-Kikori link, Madang-Baiyer link, Wau-Malalaua link, and some other planned projects in the Western and East Sepik Provinces—could easily outstrip their overall benefits. Such projects should be reconsidered under broader environmental, economic, and social grounds, rather than short-term economic considerations."
https://openalex.org/W2963386692,"Immunization is a cost-effective intervention that prevented more than 5 million deaths worldwide from 2010 to 2015. Despite increased vaccination coverage over the past four decades in many African countries, including Ethiopia, universal coverage has not yet been reached. Only 39% of children aged 12-23 months received full vaccinations in Ethiopia, according to the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey. This study aimed to evaluate immunization coverage and identify individual and community factors that explain incomplete vaccination coverage among children aged 6-36 months in the Wonago district of southern Ethiopia.We conducted a community-based, cross-sectional study in three randomly selected kebeles in the Wonago district from June to July 2017. Our nested sample of 1,116 children aged 6-36 months included 923 child-mother pairs (level 1) within kebeles (level 2). We conducted multilevel regression analysis using STATA software.Among participants, 85.0% of children aged 12-36 months received at least one vaccine, and 52.4% had complete immunization coverage. After controlling for several individual and community variables, we identified six significant predictor variables for complete immunization: Older mothers' age (AOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.09), higher utilization of antenatal care (AOR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.14-1.62), one or more tetanus-toxoid vaccination during pregnancy (AOR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.43-4.86), mothers knowing the age at which to complete child's vaccinations (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.25-3.20), being a female (AOR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43-0.95), and child receiving vitamin A supplementation within the last 6 months (AOR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.59-4.90). We observed a clustering effect at the individual and community levels with an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 48.1%.We found low immunization coverage among children in the Wonago district of southern Ethiopia, with significant differences across communities. Promoting maternal health care and community service could enhance immunization coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2964120622,"The occurrence of old-growth forests is quite limited in Mediterranean islands, which have been subject to particularly pronounced human impacts. Little is known about the carbon stocks of such peculiar ecosystems compared with different stages of secondary succession. We investigated the carbon variation in aboveground woody biomass, in litter and soil, and the nitrogen variation in litter and soil, in a 100 years long secondary succession in Mediterranean ecosystems. A vineyard, three stages of plant succession (high maquis, maquis-forest, and forest-maquis), and an old growth forest were compared. Soil samples at two soil depths (0–15 and 15–30 cm), and two litter types, relatively undecomposed and partly decomposed, were collected. Carbon stock in aboveground woody biomass increased from 6 Mg ha-1 in the vineyard to 105 Mg ha-1 in old growth forest. Along the secondary succession, soil carbon considerably increased from about 33 Mg ha-1 in the vineyard to about 69 Mg ha-1 in old growth forest. Soil nitrogen has more than doubled, ranging from 4.1 Mg ha-1 in the vineyard to 8.8 Mg ha-1 in old growth forest. Both soil parameters were found to be affected by successional stage and soil depth but not by their interaction. While the C/N ratio in the soil remained relatively constant during the succession, the C/N ratio of the litter strongly decreased, probably following the progressive increase in the holm oak contribution. While carbon content in litter decreased along the succession, nitrogen content slightly increased. Overall, carbon stock in aboveground woody biomass, litter and soil increased from about 48 Mg ha-1 in the vineyard to about 198 Mg ha-1 in old growth forest. The results of this study indicate that, even in Mediterranean environments, considerable amounts of carbon may be stored through secondary succession processes up to old growth forest."
https://openalex.org/W2962802579,"Background Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) are a frequent complication of Diabetes mellitus and a major cause of nontraumatic limb amputations. The Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, known for its resilient biofilms and antibiotic resistant profile, is the most frequent DFI pathogen. It is urgent to develop innovative treatments for these infections, being the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) nisin a potential candidate. We have previously proposed the use of a guar gum biogel as a delivery system for nisin. Here, we evaluated the potential of the nisin-biogel to enhance the efficacy of conventional antibiotics and antiseptics against DFIs S. aureus clinical isolates. Methods A collection of 23 S. aureus strains isolated from DFI patients, including multidrug- and methicillin-resistant strains, was used. The antimicrobial activity of the nisin-biogel was tested alone and in different combinations with the antiseptic chlorhexidine and the antibiotics clindamycin, gentamicin and vancomycin. Isolates’ in vitro susceptibility to the different protocols was assessed using broth microdilution methods in order to determine their ability to inhibit and/or eradicate established S. aureus biofilms. Antimicrobials were added to the 96-well plates every 8 h to simulate a typical DFI treatment protocol. Statistical analysis was conducted using RCBD ANOVA in SPSS. Results The nisin-biogel showed a high antibacterial activity against biofilms formed by DFI S. aureus. The combined protocol using nisin-biogel and chlorhexidine presented the highest efficacy in biofilm formation inhibition, significantly higher (p<0.05) than the ones presented by the antibiotics-based protocols tested. Regarding biofilm eradication, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) between the activity of the combination nisin-biogel plus chlorhexidine and the conventional antibiotic-based protocols. Conclusions Results provide a valuable contribution for the development of complementary strategies to conventional antibiotics protocols. A combined protocol including chlorhexidine and nisin-biogel could be potentially applied in medical centres, contributing for the reduction of antibiotic administration, selection pressure on DFI pathogens and resistance strains dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W2962998417,"Implantable neural probes are widely used to record and stimulate neural activities. These probes should be stiff enough for insertion. However, it should also be flexible to minimize tissue damage after insertion. Therefore, having dynamic control of the neural probe shank flexibility will be useful. For the first time, we have successfully fabricated flexible neural probes with embedded microfluidic channels for dynamic control of neural probe stiffness by controlling fluidic pressure in the channels. The present hybrid neural probes consisted of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyimide (PI) layers could provide the required stiffness for insertion and flexibility during operation. The PDMS channels were fabricated by reversal imprint using a silicon mold and bonded to a PI layer to form the embedded channels in the neural probe. The probe shape was patterned using an oxygen plasma generated by an inductively coupled plasma etching system. The critical buckling force of PDMS/PI neural probes could be tuned from 0.25–1.25 mN depending on the applied fluidic pressure in the microchannels and these probes were successfully inserted into a 0.6% agarose gel that mimicked the stiffness of the brain tissue. Polymer-based neural probes are typically more flexible than conventional metal wire-based probes, and they could potentially provide less tissue damage after implantation."
https://openalex.org/W2963912277,"The olfactory epithelium is continuously exposed to exogenous chemicals, including odorants. During the past decade, the enzymes surrounding the olfactory receptors have been shown to make an important contribution to the process of olfaction. Mammalian xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, esterases and glutathione transferases (GSTs), have been shown to participate in odorant clearance from the olfactory receptor environment, consequently contributing to the maintenance of sensitivity toward odorants. GSTs have previously been shown to be involved in numerous physiological processes, including detoxification, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and amino acid catabolism. These enzymes ensure either the capture or the glutathione conjugation of a large number of ligands. Using a multi-technique approach (proteomic, immunocytochemistry and activity assays), our results indicate that GSTs play an important role in the rat olfactory process. First, proteomic analysis demonstrated the presence of different putative odorant metabolizing enzymes, including different GSTs, in the rat nasal mucus. Second, GST expression was investigated in situ in rat olfactory tissues using immunohistochemical methods. Third, the activity of the main GST (GSTM2) odorant was studied with in vitro experiments. Recombinant GSTM2 was used to screen a set of odorants and characterize the nature of its interaction with the odorants. Our results support a significant role of GSTs in the modulation of odorant availability for receptors in the peripheral olfactory process."
https://openalex.org/W2964324757,"The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of the relative age effect (RAE) on the selection and promotion processes in an elite soccer academy. One hundred and eleven elite youth players who belonged to an elite soccer club from the Spanish ""La Liga"" participated in this study. Players were classified into three age-categories: under 14 years (U14), under 16 years (U16) and under 18 years (U18); and they were also classified in quartiles based on their date of birth (i.e., January-March, Q1; April-June, Q2; July-September, Q3; October-December, Q4). In addition, two further classification criteria were established based on the selection (i.e., selected and non-selected players) and promotion (i.e., promoted and non-promoted players) processes. The main results showed that in U14 and U16 age-categories, players born early in the year were over-represented compared to players born late in the year, although birth-distribution was not associated with the likelihood of a player to be selected or promoted. In addition, less fat in sum skinfolds, less percentage of fat, higher percentage of muscle and lower endomorphy and mesomorphy components were showed in U14 selected players, in comparison with non-selected players. Likewise, better sprint performance was found in U16 selected players versus non-selected ones. However, no significant differences on anthropometry, body composition, somatotype and physical performance were found between promoted and non-promoted players. Therefore, our results suggest there is need for coaches to reorient their talent identification programs in order to make sure that players selected to continue playing in the club have the potential to promote to the excellence in soccer."
https://openalex.org/W2963229776,"Twitter has become an important platform for geo-spatial analyses, providing high-volume spatial data on a wide variety of social processes. Understanding the relationship between population density and Twitter activity is therefore of key importance. This study reports a systematic relationship between population density and Twitter use. Number of tweets, number of users and population per unit area are related by power law functions with exponents greater than one. These relations are consistent with each other and hold across a range of spatial scales. This implies that population density can accurately predict Twitter activity, but importantly, it also implies that correct predictions are not given by a naive linear scaling analysis. The observed super-linearity has implications for any spatial analyses performed with Twitter data and is important for understanding the relationship between Twitter use and demographics. For example, the robustness of this relationship means that we can identify ‘anomalous’ geographic areas that deviate from the observed trend, identifying several towns with high/low usage relative to expectation; using the scaling relationship we are able to show that these anomalies are not caused by age structure, as has been previously proposed. Proper consideration of this scaling relationship will improve robustness in future geo-spatial studies using Twitter."
https://openalex.org/W2964118492,"Medication errors have long been associated with low-quality medical care services and significant additional medical costs.The aim of this study was to culturally adapt and validate the questionnaire on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors in the administration of intravenous medication, as well as to explore these factors in a hospital setting.The study was divided into two phases: 1) validation and cross-cultural adaptation, and 2) cross-sectional study. A total of 276 hospital-based nursing professionals participated in the study.A Cronbach's alpha value of 0.849 was found, indicating good internal consistency. In the multivariate analysis, statistically significant differences were found between knowledge and attitudes, demonstrating that having greater suitable knowledge correlates with having a more positive attitude. It was also discovered that having a positive attitude as well as the necessary knowledge increases the possibility of engaging in adequate behaviors.The knowledge, attitudes and behavior questionnaire has a satisfactory internal consistency in order to be applied to the Spanish context. Implications for nursing management: Knowledge acquisition and positive attitude are both factors which promote adequate behavior, which in turn seems to have an impact on medication errors prevention. Health institutions must encourage continuous education for their employees."
https://openalex.org/W2964134961,"Background Despite considerable efforts to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) among female sex workers (FSW), other sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs, such preventing unintended pregnancies, among FSW have received far less attention. Programs targeting FSW with comprehensive, accessible services are needed to address their broader SRH needs. This study tested the effectiveness of an intervention to increase dual contraceptive method use to prevent STIs, HIV and unintended pregnancy among FSW attending services in drop-in centers (DIC) in two cities in Kenya. The intervention included enhanced peer education, and routine screening for family planning (FP) needs plus expanded non-condom FP method availability in the DIC. Methods We conducted a two-group, pre-/posttest, quasi-experimental study with 719 FSW (360 intervention group, 359 comparison group). Participants were interviewed at baseline and 6 months later to examine changes in condom and non-condom FP method use. Results The intervention had a significant positive effect on non-condom, FP method use (OR = 1.38, 95%CI (1.04, 1.83)), but no effect on dual method use. Consistent condom use was reported to be high; however, many women also reported negotiating condom use with both paying and non-paying partners as difficult or very difficult. The strongest predictor of consistent condom use was partner type (paying versus non-paying/emotional); FSW reported both paying and non-paying partners also influence non-condom contraceptive use. Substantial numbers of FSW also reported experiencing sexual violence by both paying and non-paying partners. Conclusions Self-reported difficulties with consistent condom use and the sometimes dangerous conditions under which they work leave FSW vulnerable to unintended pregnancy STIs/HIV. Adding non-barrier FP methods to condoms is crucial to curb unintended pregnancies and their potential adverse health, social and economic consequences. Findings also highlight the need for additional strategies beyond condoms to reduce HIV and STI risk among FSW. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01957813"
https://openalex.org/W2962740708,"Residential segregation into spatial neighborhoods and boroughs is a well-known spatial dynamic process that characterise complex urban environments. Existing models of segregation, including the pioneering Schelling ones, often do not consider all the factors that can contribute to this process. Segregation as well as aggregation emerges from local interactions among individuals, and is rooted in the complexity of social, economic and environmental interactions. The main objective of this study is to develop and implement a geospatial agent-based model to simulate the decision-making process of location of new household for incoming immigrant populations. Particularly this study aims to simulate and analyse the dynamics of the new immigrant populations arriving in the bilingual cities and boroughs of the island of Montreal. The model was implemented in NetLogo software, using real geospatial datasets. The obtained simulation results indicate realistic spatial patterns of spatial composition of the ethnographic fabric on the island of Montreal. The proposed model has the potential to be used as part of the city planning purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2963387277,"For many disease conditions, tissue samples are colored with multiple dyes and stains to add contrast and location information for specific proteins to accurately identify and diagnose disease. This presents a computational challenge for digital pathology, as whole-slide images (WSIs) need to be properly overlaid (i.e. registered) to identify co-localized features. Traditional image registration methods sometimes fail due to the high variation of cell density and insufficient texture information in WSIs–particularly at high magnifications. In this paper, we proposed a robust image registration strategy to align re-stained WSIs precisely and efficiently. This method is applied to 30 pairs of immunohistochemical (IHC) stains and their hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) counterparts. Our approach advances the existing methods in three key ways. First, we introduce refinements to existing image registration methods. Second, we present an effective weighting strategy using kernel density estimation to mitigate registration errors. Third, we account for the linear relationship across WSI levels to improve accuracy. Our experiments show significant decreases in registration errors when matching IHC and H&E pairs, enabling subcellular-level analysis on stained and re-stained histological images. We also provide a tool to allow users to develop their own registration benchmarking experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2962775018,"Although the literature on the Maillard reaction in infant formulas is extensive, most studies have focused on model systems, and in only a few cases on real food systems. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine the status of the Maillard reaction, both the early and advanced phases, in a variety of commercial infant formulas available on the Swedish market. Ten powder and liquid milk-based infant formulas from three manufacturers were selected to determine available lysine and CML contents, the two established indicators of the reaction. The products were also characterized with respect to protein content, carbohydrates composition, water content and water activity. In order to be able to compare the impact of different processing steps applied on powder and liquid formulas, the solid formulas contained similar ingredients as their corresponding liquid ones. Our findings showed that powder and liquid formulas contained similar available lysine concentrations regardless of the manufacturer, showing 27.14–36.57% decrease in the available lysine, compared to the reference skim milk powder in this study. The CML concentrations were in a broad range of 68.77–507.99 mg / kg protein. In the case of one manufacturer, liquid infant formulas had significantly higher CML content, compared to the powder products (p < 0.05). The results from this study are a step taken towards better understanding of the extent of the Maillard reaction in real complex systems of infant formulas."
https://openalex.org/W2964143903,"The participation of diverse demographics in higher education has risen over the last half-century; meanwhile, different political and social tiers have been assigning a more active role to institutions in terms of equality and social justice. This change in circumstances has led to the roll out of processes to institutionalise diversity outreach. This study was conducted for the clear purpose of assessing the current institutionalisation status of diversity outreach in 127 key universities from the Academic Ranking of World Universities based on the opinions of diversity outreach managers and the information published on institutional websites, in turn measuring compliance with various indicators. A qualitative analysis of the institutional statements, the goals sought through strategic plans and the definitions of diversity itself was also conducted. The evidence reveals the early stage of the institutionalisation process in universities on account of the low percentage obtained for the proposed indicators. Furthermore, the study failed to exhibit significant differences in this process in terms of the institutional ownership or position held in the ranking; however, more prominent progress was noted in the North-American region when geographical differences were taken into account, likely as a result of the historical background in the advocacy for equal opportunities. Lastly, a change of approach to the conceptualisation of diversity is suggested in favour of equality and social justice."
https://openalex.org/W2962966851,"Newly emerging viral pathogens pose a constant and unpredictable threat to human and animal health. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a penchant for sudden emergence, as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and most recently, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Small animal models of emerging viral pathogenesis are crucial to better understand the virus and host factors driving disease progression. However, rodent models are often criticized for their limited translatability to humans. The complete blood count is the most ordered clinical test in the United States serving as the cornerstone of clinical medicine and differential diagnosis. We recently generated a mouse model for MERS-CoV pathogenesis through the humanization of the orthologous entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). To increase the translatability of this model, we validated and established the use of an automated veterinary hematology analyzer (VetScan HM5) at biosafety level 3 for analysis of peripheral blood. MERS-CoV lung titer peaked 2 days post infection concurrent with lymphopenia and neutrophilia in peripheral blood, two phenomena also observed in MERS-CoV infection of humans. The fluctuations in leukocyte populations measured by Vetscan HM5 were corroborated by standard flow cytometry, thus confirming the utility of this approach. Comparing a sublethal and lethal dose of MERS-CoV in mice, analysis of daily blood draws demonstrates a dose dependent modulation of leukocytes. Major leukocyte populations were modulated before weight loss was observed. Importantly, neutrophil counts on 1dpi were predictive of disease severity with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV highlighting the predictive value of hematology in this model. Taken together, the inclusion of hematological measures in mouse models of emerging viral pathogenesis increases their translatability and should elevate the preclinical evaluation of MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines to better mirror the complexity of the human condition."
https://openalex.org/W2964050360,"In this study, we compared the antibacterial effectivity of the eggs of six precocial and four altricial bird species using Escherichia coli, based on their eggshell traits. The ultrastructure of eggshell was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). According to SEM results, eggs from precocial birds (chicken, turkey, quail, duck, ostrich, and goose) had cuticle on the eggshells, while eggs from altricial birds (pigeon, budgerigar, munia, and canary) did not. The environment/selection pressure may induce the divergent evolution process in eggs of precocial and altricial birds. The E. coli experiment results showed that chicken, turkey, quail, duck, and goose eggs, with a high cuticle opacity, exhibited a much lower E. coli penetration rate. In contrast, the eggs with poor (ostrich) or without (pigeon, budgerigar, munia, and canary) cuticle exhibited a higher penetration rate. It is suggested that cuticle is a main barrier against bacterial penetration in precocial birds’ eggs. Turkey and quail eggs showed the lowest E. coli contamination rate (3.33% and 2.22%, respectively), probably because of the tightly connected nanosphere structure on their cuticle. As for altricial birds’ eggs, the eggs of budgerigar, munia, and canary with small pore diameter (0.57 to 1.22 μm) had a lower E. coli penetration rate than pigeon eggs (45.56%, 66.67%, 50%, and 97.78%, respectively, P < 0.05), indicating that pore diameter played a significant role in defending against bacterial trans-shell invasion. We found that eggshell thickness and pore area decreased with egg size. The cuticle quality had no relationship with egg size, but was closely related to the bird species. The E. coli penetration rate of altricial birds’ eggs was significantly higher than that of precocial birds’ eggs, mainly because the pores are exposed on the eggshell surface and cuticle protection is absent. This study provides detailed information on the eggshell cuticle, which gives insight into the cuticle evolution process that occurred in precocial and altricial bird species. Moreover, the results of E. coli penetration may help understanding the antibacterial behavior in birds."
https://openalex.org/W2964236456,"The mechanisms through which livestock ownership is associated with childhood anaemia are contested. Using a cross-sectional, community-based survey of 300 households in southern Ghana, we determined the associations of household livestock ownership with anaemia among children aged 2-5 years. Potential mediating effects of animal-source food (ASF) consumption, microbial infections, and household food security were investigated. Data on each child's anaemia, malaria, and intestinal infections were collected for a subset of 221 households. Anaemia was defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration <110 g/L. ASF consumption was measured as a count of the number of different ASF types consumed by each child in the week prior to the interview. Household food security was measured with a 15-item, pre-tested tool adapted from the USDA Household Food Security Core Module. The number of sheep and goats in aggregate was associated with higher odds of a child being anaemic (aOR (95% CI) = 1.10 (1.03, 1.17)). Households owning more free-range poultry had greater diversity of consumed ASFs among children (Coef. (95% C) = 0.02 (0.01, 0.03)). Owning more pigs was associated with higher odds that a household was food secure (1.05 (0.99, 1.12). We found no evidence that the child's ASF consumption mediated the association of livestock ownership with child anaemia, however,household food security mediated the association between household pig ownership and child anaemia. Overall, household ownership of livestock was associated with higher ASF consumption among children and improved household-level food security, yet also a higher odd of anaemia among those young children. The mechanisms leading to these seemingly counterintuitive relationships require further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2963291669,"Latinos are the largest and fastest-growing minority group in the U.S., and Latina women represent the largest portion of minority births, having the highest birth rate in the U.S. for over 20 years. In addition, Latina women are at increased risk of entering pregnancy being overweight or having obesity and gaining excess gestational weight. Excess gestational weight gain (GWG) has short- and long-term adverse health outcomes for the woman and her child. Although culturally tailored interventions show promise toward promoting healthy GWG among Latina women, findings from current interventions have had mixed results, suggesting the need for further tailoring to meet the needs of this heterogeneous population group. This qualitative study was designed to explore first-time pregnant, low-income Latina women’s beliefs, attitudes, and experiences with GWG. The study employed qualitative research using semi-structured interviews conducted with 23 first-time pregnant Latina women between 22 and 36 weeks of gestation. Interviews were conducted by trained bilingual staff, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results showed that participants were uncertain if their GWG was within a healthy range. Although the majority of participants knew that GWG should be limited, they were not sure what the amount should be. In addition, the majority of participants reported attitudes of acceptance of and resignation to excessive GWG as being part of pregnancy. Several women appeared to believe that they did not have control over their weight gain during pregnancy. Moreover, analysis identified that sociocultural and interpersonal factors such as social support influence the beliefs, attitudes, and experiences with GWG of the low-income, majority immigrant Latina women who participated in this study. Study findings can be used to further tailor prenatal care practices and interventions aimed at altering modifiable risk factors associated with excess GWG among Latinas. Future interventions designed for low-income, immigrant Latina women that consider sociocultural influences on women’s beliefs and attitudes related to GWG, as well as the influence of social support networks on women’s health behaviors during pregnancy, will likely be more effective in preventing excessive GWG."
https://openalex.org/W2963762918,"The sugarcane borer moth, Diatraea saccharalis, is one of the most important pests of sugarcane and maize crops in the Western Hemisphere. The pest is widespread throughout South and Central America, the Caribbean region and the southern United States. One of the most intriguing features of D. saccharalis population dynamics is the high rate of range expansion reported in recent years. To shed light on the history of colonization of D. saccharalis, we investigated the genetic structure and diversity in American populations using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) markers throughout the genome and sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase (COI). Our primary goal was to propose possible dispersal routes from the putative center of origin that can explain the spatial pattern of genetic diversity. Our findings showed a clear correspondence between genetic structure and the geographical distributions of this pest insect on the American continents. The clustering analyses indicated three distinct groups: one composed of Brazilian populations, a second group composed of populations from El Salvador, Mexico, Texas and Louisiana and a third group composed of the Florida population. The predicted time of divergence predates the agriculture expansion period, but the pattern of distribution of haplotype diversity suggests that human-mediated movement was most likely the factor responsible for the widespread distribution in the Americas. The study of the early history of D. saccharalis promotes a better understanding of range expansion, the history of invasion, and demographic patterns of pest populations in the Americas."
https://openalex.org/W2963588881,"The trade in live animals and animal products is considered one of the major drivers of zoonotic disease emergence. Schiphol airport in the Netherlands is one of the largest European airports and is considered a main hub for legal and illegal import of exotic animals. However, so far there is little information about what pathogens these imported animals might carry with them. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the zoonotic risks of exotic animals imported into the Netherlands through Schiphol airport in 2013 and 2014. Based on a previous list of highly prioritised emerging zoonoses for the Netherlands (EmZoo list), WAHID and Promed databases, literature and expert opinions, a list of 143 potentially relevant zoonotic pathogens was compiled. In a step-wise selection process eighteen pathogen-host combinations that may pose a public health risk by the import of exotic animals via Schiphol airport were identified and these were assessed by expert elicitation. The five pathogens with the highest combined scores were Salmonella spp., Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, West Nile virus, Yersinia pestis and arenaviruses, but overall, the public health risk of the introduction of these exotic pathogens into the Netherlands via the legal import of exotic animals was considered low. However, the vast majority of imported exotic animals were imported by trade companies, increasing the risk for specific groups such as retail and hobbyists/pet owners. It is expected that the risk of introduction of exotic zoonotic pathogens via illegal import is substantial due to the unknown health status. Due to changing trade patterns combined with changing epidemiological situation in the world and changing epidemiological features of pathogens, this risk assessment needs regular updating. The results could give directions for further adjusting of health requirements and risk based additional testing of imported exotic animals."
https://openalex.org/W2906590643,"Monitoring aerobic exercise intensities of free-living physical activities is valuable for purposes such as education and research. The heart rate (HR) method, based on the linear relation between HR and oxygen uptake (VO2), is potentially valuable for this purpose. Three prerequisites are that the method is reproducible, and valid for the specific form of physical activity executed as well as under field conditions. The aim of this study is to evaluate reproducibility of the heart rate method in the laboratory. VO2 and HR measurements were made on two different occasions during three submaximal (model 1) plus a maximal exercise intensity (model 2) on a cycle ergometer in the laboratory. 19 habitual commuter cyclists (9 males and 10 females), aged 44 ± 3 years, were measured. The reproducibility of the estimated VO2, based on three levels of HR from commuting cycling and the regression equations from test and retest were analyzed. Differences between the two models were also studied. For both models, there were no significant differences between test and retest in the constituents of the regression equations (y-intercept, slope and r-value). Neither were there any systematic differences in estimated absolute levels of VO2 between test and retest. The relative differences between test and retest, based on estimations from three different levels of HR, were 0.99 ± 11.0 (n.s.), 2.67 ± 6.48 (n.s.) and 3.57 ± 6.24% (p<0.05) for model 1, and 1.09 ± 10.6, 1.75 ± 6.43 and 2.12 ± 5.92% (all n.s.) for model 2. However, some large individual differences were seen in both models. There were no significant differences between the two models in the slopes, intercepts or r-values of the regression equations or in the estimated levels of VO2. The heart rate method shows good reproducibility on the group level in estimating oxygen consumption from HR-VO2 relations in the laboratory, and based on three levels of HR which are representative for cycle commuting. However, on the individual level, some large variations were seen."

We explore a combination of blood-based joint tissue metabolites (neoepitopes) to enable patient clustering through distinct disease profiles. We analysed data from two RA studies (LITHE (N = 574, follow-up 24 and 52 weeks), OSKIRA-1 (N = 131, follow-up 24 weeks)). Two osteoarthritis (OA) studies (SMC01 (N = 447), SMC02 (N = 81)) were included as non-RA comparators. Specific tissue-derived neoepitopes measured at baseline, included: C2M (cartilage degradation); CTX-I and PINP (bone turnover); C1M and C3M (interstitial matrix degradation); CRPM (CRP metabolite) and VICM (macrophage activity). Clustering was performed to identify putative endotypes. We identified five clusters (A-E). Clusters A and B were characterized by generally higher levels of biomarkers than other clusters, except VICM which was significantly higher in cluster B than in cluster A (p<0.001). Biomarker levels in Cluster C were all close to the median, whilst Cluster D was characterised by low levels of all biomarkers. Cluster E also had low levels of most biomarkers, but with significantly higher levels of CTX-I compared to cluster D. There was a significant difference in ΔSHP score observed at 52 weeks (p<0.05). We describe putative RA endotypes based on biomarkers reflecting joint tissue metabolism. These endotypes differ in their underlining pathogenesis, and may in the future have utility for patient treatment selection."
https://openalex.org/W2963047118,"Misunderstandings about the influence of land-surface features on tornado frequency and other tornado-related misconceptions may affect how people prepare for and behave during hazardous weather events. This research uses a phone survey (n = 1804) to assess how participants in three regions of Tennessee perceive their local tornado characteristics (i.e., direction of travel, seasonality, and diurnal timing) and their belief in protection from land-surface features (i.e., hills, water bodies, and buildings). Region of residence influences most beliefs in local tornado characteristics, and demographic characteristics, specifically age and gender, also have some influence. Residents in hilly East Tennessee are more likely to believe they are protected by hills and underestimate the proportion of nocturnal tornadoes, while residents in West Tennessee are more likely to believe they are protected by water bodies, perhaps because of proximity to the Mississippi River. Outside of the typical severe-weather season, participants were uncertain of when tornadoes were likely to occur; specifically, they did not recognize their local wintertime tornado activity. Because public perceptions are related to local features, local organizations and personnel, for example National Weather Service offices and broadcast meteorologists, may be most helpful in dispelling these misconceptions."

However, most in vitro assays display significant differences to the in vivo situation and limited predictive properties. We applied medium perfusion methods to mimic interstitial fluid flow to establish a novel infection model of Leishmania parasites.Leishmania major infection of mouse peritoneal macrophages was studied within the Quasi Vivo QV900 macro-perfusion system. Under a constant flow of culture media at a rate of 360μl/min, L. major infected macrophages were cultured either at the base of a perfusion chamber or raised on 9mm high inserts. Mathematical and computational modelling was conducted to estimate medium flow speed, shear stress and oxygen concentration. The effects of medium flow on infection rate, intracellular amastigote division, macrophage phagocytosis and macropinocytosis were measured.Mean fluid speeds at the macrophage cell surface were estimated to be 1.45 x 10-9 m/s and 1.23 x 10-7 m/s for cells at the base of the chamber and cells on an insert, respectively. L. major macrophage infection was significantly reduced under both media perfusion conditions compared to cells maintained under static conditions; a 85±3% infection rate of macrophages at 72 hours in static cultures compared to 62±5% for cultures under slow medium flow and 55±3% under fast medium flow. Media perfusion also decreased amastigote replication and both macrophage phagocytosis (by 44±4% under slow flow and 57±5% under fast flow compared with the static condition) and macropinocytosis (by 40±4% under slow flow and 62±5% under fast flow compared with the static condition) as measured by uptake of latex beads and pHrodo Red dextran.Perfusion of culture medium in an in vitro L. major macrophage infection model (simulating in vivo lymphatic flow) reduced the infection rate of macrophages, the replication of the intracellular parasite, macrophage phagocytosis and macropinocytosis with greater reductions achieved under faster flow speeds."

The study examined the role of quality of worklife (QWL) in motivating and retaining LGTBS.The study was conducted in south-eastern region of Nigeria comprising five states and 95 local government areas. The design was mixed-methods. We used cross-sectional survey to collect quantitative data on socio-demographic factors, QWL, motivation and retention from a total sample of LGTBS. The qualitative component involved focus group discussions (n = 3) with 26 LGTBS. Quantitative data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis, descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test and multiple linear regression. Qualitative data were analysed using a thematic framework approach.The final 40-item QWL scale was found to be valid and reliable. The LGTBS had high QWL (M = 5.15, SD = 0.88) and motivation (M = 5.92, SD = 1.08), but low intention to leave their jobs (M = 2.68, SD = 1.59). Education significantly predicted satisfaction with overall QWL, work-family balance and work design; but tenure predicted satisfaction with work context. Work design and work-family balance significantly predicted motivation of LGTBS. Motivation mediated the relationship between QWL and intention to leave and accounted for 29% variance in intention to leave. Whereas LGTBS were motivated by responsibility, learning opportunities, achievement and recognition; they were dissatisfied with lack of flexible work schedules, involvement in non-TB tasks, long hours at work, limited opportunities for vacation, resource inadequacy, work-related stigma, lack of promotional opportunities, and pay disparity and delay.Addressing work design, work-family balance and working conditions may increase the motivation and retention of LGTBS and improve human resources for TB at the district level and performance of the TB control programme."
https://openalex.org/W2962989643,"Pathogen monitoring, detection and removal are essential to public health and outbreak management. Systems are in place for monitoring the microbial load of hospitals and public health facilities with strategies to mitigate pathogen spread. However, no such strategies are in place for ambulances, which are tasked with transporting at-risk individuals in immunocompromised states. As standard culturing techniques require a laboratory setting, and are time consuming and labour intensive, our approach was designed to be portable, inexpensive and easy to use based on the MinION third-generation sequencing platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. We developed a transferable sampling-to-analysis pipeline to characterize the microbial community in emergency medical service vehicles. Our approach identified over sixty-eight organisms in ambulances to the genera level, with a proportion of these being connected with health-care associated infections, such as Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus spp. We also monitored the microbiome of different locations across three ambulances over time, and examined the dynamic community of microorganisms found in emergency medical service vehicles. Observed differences identified hot spots, which may require heightened monitoring and extensive cleaning. Through metagenomics analysis it is also possible to identify how microorganisms spread between patients and colonize an ambulance over time. The sequencing results aid in the development of practices to mitigate disease spread, while also providing a useful tool for outbreak prediction through ongoing analysis of the ambulance microbiome to identify new and emerging pathogens. Overall, this pipeline allows for the tracking and monitoring of pathogenic microorganisms of epidemiological interest, including those related to health-care associated infections."
https://openalex.org/W2963573148,"Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abatacept, tocilizumab, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors as compared with rituximab in Finnish rheumatoid arthritis patients, who have previously been treated with TNF inhibitors. Methods A patient-level simulation model was developed to predict costs and outcomes associated with four biological drugs (abatacept, tocilizumab, rituximab and TNF inhibitors) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Following lack of efficacy or adverse events, the patients were switched to another biological drug until all four options were exhausted. After that, the patients were assumed to receive a 6th line treatment until death. The patients’ baseline characteristics and regression models used in the simulation were based on observational data from the National Register for Biological Treatments in Finland. Direct costs comprised drug costs, administration costs, costs of switching, and outpatient and inpatient care, while indirect costs included disability pension and sick leaves due to rheumatoid arthritis. Several subgroup and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results Drug costs were the lowest for rituximab, but when administration costs and costs of switching were included, drug costs were the lowest for TNF inhibitors. Abatacept was associated with the highest drug costs, whereas rituximab was associated with the highest healthcare costs. In total, TNF inhibitors had the lowest direct costs, while rituximab had the highest direct costs. The amount of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained ranged from 9.405 for rituximab to 9.661 for TNF inhibitors. TNF inhibitors, abatacept, and tocilizumab were dominant in comparison to RTX. Conclusions TNF inhibitors, abatacept, and tocilizumab had lower costs and higher QALYs than rituximab, and therefore, they were dominant in comparison to rituximab. As TNF inhibitors had the lowest costs and highest QALYs, they were the most cost-effective treatment option."

In Kenya, trauma is one of the top 10 leading causes of death. However, no formal continuous injury surveillance systems are in place to inform injury prevention, pre-hospital care or emergency department management. The aim of this study was to implement a hospital-based trauma registry to characterize high acuity injuries presenting to a private tertiary, teaching and referral hospital in Kenya.From January to December 2015, data was prospectively collected at a private tertiary, teaching and referral hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Patients presenting with a traumatic injury for the first time who were admitted to the hospital for at least 48 hours were included in the study. Basic information pertaining to demographics, details of the injury, pre-hospital care and transport, hospital-based management, length of stay and disposition were collected. An injury severity score (ISS) was calculated on each patient and stratified by the mechanism of injury. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze data and assess risk factors associated with injury severity.There were 101 patients included in the study, the majority of whom were 30 to 39 years of age and male (63%). Seventy-one per cent of patients had a preexisting medical condition with hypertension (26%) and diabetes (13%) being the most common. The most common mechanism of injury was fall (46%) followed by road traffic incidents (RTI) (32%). Most injuries took place at home (43%). Most RTI were caused by cars (63%), with the driver being the most frequently injured (38%). The most common mode of arrival to the emergency department was by private car (72%). The median time between the accident and arrival at the emergency department was 1hr 10 minutes. The majority of the patients had injuries to one area (83%) with the extremities/bony pelvis (72%) being the most common. The median Injury Severity Score was 5 (range 1-34) with the majority (90%) classified as minor injuries (ISS<12). The highest severity of injury as determined by ISS was seen in gunshot wounds.Injured patients in Kenya showed concordance with prior studies looking at injury prevalence in the developing world when looking at demographics and place of injury. However, differences were found when looking at the mechanism of injury, with falls surpassing road traffic incidents. A delayed presentation to the hospital was also noted in this patient population. Given the rate of traumatic injuries in Kenya and their contribution to morbidity, mortality and overall healthcare costs, there is a need to implement formal trauma registries in all major hospitals in Kenya to generate more data that can be used to improve injury prevention, the overall trauma system and enhance training and preparedness."
https://openalex.org/W2964015020,"Criniviruses accumulate in the phloem tissue and damage crops by reducing chlorophyll which is essential for plant growth and development. Tomato chlorosis crinivirus (ToCV) is vectored by several whitefly species that damage tomato crops throughout the world. In South Africa, ToCV is a poorly studied pathogen of global economic importance. Therefore, a national survey was initiated to investigate the occurrence and distribution of criniviruses infecting tomato crops in South Africa. Whitefly infested tomato crops exhibiting interveinal leaf chlorosis and chlorotic flecking symptoms were assayed for crinivirus infections using a multiplex reverse transcription polymerase reaction (RT-PCR) approach to assess for the presence of crinivirus species that are known to infect solanaceous hosts. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to generate the complete genome of ToCV from South Africa. Results from the survey indicated that ToCV is presently the only crinivirus species infecting tomatoes in South Africa. Blast analysis showed that the RNA-1 segment of ToCV from South Africa (ToCR1-186) matched 99% to Spanish isolates. On the other hand, the RNA-2 (ToCR2-186) segment matched 98% to a South Korean isolate and three Spanish isolates. Although recombination events were not detected, phylogenetic studies showed inconsistencies in the grouping of RNA-1 and RNA-2 segments for some of the ToCV isolates analyzed in this study. Therefore, we suggest the possibility of intraspecific reassortment. This is the first comprehensive study and full genome sequence of ToCV from South Africa. The information generated from this study is intended to raise awareness of ToCV infections on tomato crops in South Africa."

The disparity in antioxidant-oxidant levels in HIV patients favours viral replication and disease progression. This study aimed at determining the effect of ART on antioxidant enzymes activities and trace elements levels in Ghanaian HIV patients. A total of 242 participants; comprising of 105 HIV-infected patients on ART, 77 HIV-infected ART-naïve, and 60 HIV seronegative controls were recruited for the study. Whole blood was collected and used for haematological profiling, and the determination of CD4+ counts, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and trace element levels. Serum was used for liver function tests and the determination of glutathione reductase (GR) activity, and plasma was used to estimate reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. Low levels of haemoglobin (HB), hematocrit, mean cell volume (MCV) and mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and trace elements were found in ART-naïve patients compared to those on ART and the seronegative controls. In the ART-naïve patients, glutathione reductase (GR) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) level were significantly low compared to patients on ART and seronegative controls. Activity of SOD was significantly reduced in ART-naïve patients compared to those on ART and the control group, and manganese is the only trace element that showed a strong negative correlation with SOD activity and a positive and significant correlation with CD4+ count, and therefore needs to be investigated further. The study suggests that assessing antioxidant levels or enzymes activities of patients infected with HIV should be considered during therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2962848481,"Handling and consumption of Campylobacter-contaminated poultry meat is the most common cause of human campylobacteriosis. While many studies deal with interventions to reduce Campylobacter spp. on chicken carcasses, studies on other poultry species are rare. In the present study, a spray treatment with peracetic acid (PAA) on turkey carcasses was evaluated. For this, parts of breast fillets with skin and Campylobacter (C.) jejuni DSM 4688 (108 cfu/ml) inoculated drumsticks were sprayed for 30 s with PAA (1200 ppm) or water as control solution. Samples were packaged under modified atmosphere and stored at 4°C until analysis on day 1, 6 and 12. The breast fillets were used for determination of the total viable count, sensory and meat quality examination as well as myoglobin content and biogenic amines. The drumsticks were used for C. jejuni counts. PAA had a significant effect in reducing total viable counts on all days by up to 1.2 log10 compared to the untreated control. Treatment with water alone showed no effect. C. jejuni counts were significantly reduced by PAA (0.9–1.3 log10), while water achieved a 0.5 log10 reduction on C. jejuni counts on day 1. No differences in sensory, pH, electrical conductivity and myoglobin content could be found. The skin of the PAA treated fillets had lower redness values than the water control on day 1, whereas on day 12 parts of the water treated muscles were lighter than the untreated control. A lower putrescine content of the water sprayed fillets in comparison to the control sample on day 12 was the only significant difference concerning the biogenic amines. Results from this study indicate that a spray treatment with 1200 ppm PAA would be a useful measure to lower the Campylobacter spp. counts on turkey carcasses without having a negative influence on product quality."

The sample consisted of 103 adults with arthritis and 123 adults without arthritis. Data were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance, χ2-test, Pearson’s correlation, and multiple regression analysis. All variables except age and religion showed statistically significant differences between older adults with and without arthritis. The group with arthritis reported lower scores on social networks, health-promoting behaviors, and health-related quality of life compared to the healthy group without arthritis. Analyzed using multiple regression, 43.8% of the older adults with arthritis had the factors related to health-related quality of life (F = 40.71, p < .001) including exercise (β = .43, p < .001) and living with someone (β = .32, p = .001). In the group of older adults without arthritis, 26.2% had the factors related to health-related quality of life (F = 15.44, p < .001) including exercise (β = .31, p = .001), social gatherings, and employment status. Exercise was one of the factors that showed the strongest relationship to health-related quality of life. The provision of resources that can enable an individual to engage in physical activities is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2963373846,"In this article, patient activity in 8 audio recorded specialist consultations on fetal cardiology is investigated in order to explore how, why and when patients tend to participate in encounters in which the doctor dominates the interaction. The overall question is: How can the participation of patients in the consultations be connected to the development of higher levels of health literacy, i.e. to interactive literacy and to critical literacy? Patient participation is here understood as interactive action and is analyzed in terms of different interactive moves, which are related to different recurring topics. Despite the highly standardized format of the consultations, there is a large variation between the patients’ participation: between 0.7 and 2.8 moves per minute. The patients participate most during the topics ‘Prevalence’ and ‘Consultations’ and least during the topic ‘The normal heart’. Although most of the patients' moves are responses to what the doctor says, they remarkably often pose questions and use so called rejoinders. By posing questions, they take control of the information flow and sometimes even change the topics. By using rejoinders, they analyze the problems involved in the discussion e.g. by asking for clarifications or confirmation. Patients with a low over-all participation rate also use fewer moves that indicate higher literacy levels. The qualitative analysis problematizes the idea of a simple scale from basic literacy to critical literacy. Moves that indicate basic literacy skills are interactively important for the learning activity, led by the doctor. However, patients who mainly support the doctor’s initiatives don’t take the opportunity to influence the flow of information in ways that might favor their health literacy development."
https://openalex.org/W2963655891,"The robustness of motor outputs to muscle dysfunction has been investigated using musculoskeletal modeling, but with conflicting results owing to differences in model complexity and motor tasks. Our objective was to systematically study how the number of kinematic degrees of freedom, and the number of independent muscle actuators alter the robustness of motor output to muscle dysfunction. We took a detailed musculoskeletal model of the human leg and systematically varied the model complexity to create six models with either 3 or 7 kinematic degrees of freedom and either 14, 26, or 43 muscle actuators. We tested the redundancy of each model by quantifying the reduction in sagittal plane feasible force set area when a single muscle was removed. The robustness of feasible force set area to the loss of any single muscle, i.e. general single muscle loss increased with the number of independent muscles and decreased with the number of kinematic degrees of freedom, with the robust area varying from 1% and 52% of the intact feasible force set area. The maximum sensitivity of the feasible force set to the loss of any single muscle varied from 75% to 26% of the intact feasible force set area as the number of muscles increased. Additionally, the ranges of feasible muscle activation for maximum force production were largely unconstrained in many cases, indicating ample musculoskeletal redundancy even for maximal forces. We propose that ratio of muscles to kinematic degrees of freedom can be used as a rule of thumb for estimating musculoskeletal redundancy in both simulated and real biomechanical systems."
https://openalex.org/W2964089501,"Recent years have seen tremendous advances in the scientific study of networks, as more and larger data sets of relationships among nodes have become available in many different fields. This has led to pathbreaking discoveries of near-universal network behavior over time, including the principle of preferential attachment and the emergence of scaling in complex networks. Missing from the set of network analysis methods to date is a measure that describes for each node how its relationship (or links) with other nodes changes from one period to the next. Conventional measures of network change for the most part show how the degrees of a node change; these are scalar comparisons. Our contribution is to use, for the first time, the cosine similarity to capture not just the change in degrees of a node but its relationship to other nodes. These are vector (or matrix)-based comparisons, rather than scalar, and we refer to them as “rewiring” coefficients. We apply this measure to three different networks over time to show the differences in the two types of measures.

Data collection took place between November 2015 and February 2017. Outcomes: preferred monitoring frequency; referral to other health care provider(s); medication change. One measurement at the end of the consultation. We performed logistic regression analyses. Differences between primary and secondary care were analyzed.Many patients arranged a monitoring frequency <4 times per year (general practices 19.5%, outpatient clinics 40%, p < .001). Type of provider (physician/nurse, OR 3.83, p < .001), baseline HbA1c (OR 1.02, p = .017), glucose lowering medication; and setting treatment goals (OR .65, p = .048) were associated with the chosen frequency. Independently associated with a referral were age (OR .99, p = .039), baseline glucose lowering medication and patients' goal setting (OR 1.52, p = .016). Medication change was associated with type of provider, baseline HbA1c, blood glucose lowering medication, quality of life (OR .80, p = .037) and setting treatment goals (OR 2.64, p = .001).Not only disease but also person related factors, especially setting treatment goals, are independently associated with planned care use in person-centered diabetes care."
https://openalex.org/W2963263920,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of walking speed and slope on foot pressure changes in young healthy adults.Twenty young healthy adults (mean age 22.4 years, SD 1.2 years; 10 male and 10 female) participated in the study. Dynamic pedobarographic data during treadmill walking were obtained for combinations of three different walking speeds (3.2 km/hr, 4.3 km/hr, and 5.4 km/hr) and 5 different slopes (downhill 8 degrees, downhill 4 degrees, ground walking (0 degree), uphill 4 degrees, and uphill 8 degrees). Pedobarographic data such as the peak pressure and pressure-time integral were measured on five plantar segments: medial forefoot (MFF), lateral forefoot (LFF), medial midfoot (MMF), lateral midfoot (LMF), and heel. Maximum ankle dorsiflexion was also recorded using the Plug in Gait marker set.All participants maintained heel-toe gait in all walking conditions. The peak pressure on the MFF during downhill slope walking was lower than that during ground and uphill walking, whereas the peak pressure on the MFF during uphill slope walking was similar to that during ground walking at each walking speed. The peak pressures on the heel were similar for different walking slopes at each walking speed. The peak pressures on the MFF and heel increased with an increase in walking speed. The pressure-time integral of the MFF did not show significant changes at different walking speeds and slopes. The pressure-time integral of the heel increased with an increase in walking slope and decrease in walking speed.Different walking speeds and slopes affected the pedobarographic characteristics of young healthy adults. Downhill walking with slower speed appeared to be beneficial to reduce or optimize MFF pressures, while downhill walking at a comfortable speed would be helpful to reduce or optimize heel pressures. The findings of this study have clinical implications in recommending activities to patients with foot pressure-related symptoms and disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2963498925,"A long-standing goal shared by researchers has been to design optimal experimental procedures, including the selection of appropriate stimuli. Pictures are commonly used in different research fields. However, until recently, researchers have relied mostly on line-drawings, which can have poor ecological validity. We developed a set of high quality standardized photographs of objects from six different categories, recorded under two camera viewpoints, and five presentation conditions (on its own, held by clean hands, and by hands covered with different substances: sauce, chocolate and mud). These various staging conditions can be used to induce different emotional states while maintaining the object of interest constant. We first report normative data on the objects' name agreement and familiarity collected from North American and Portuguese participants. Results showed high name agreement and familiarity in both samples. Next, arousal, disgust and valence ratings were collected for the stimuli under either an emotional-activating or a neutral context. Subjective ratings varied according to the staging condition and the context, confirming that the same items can effectively be used in different emotional conditions. This database allows researchers to select more ecologically-valid stimuli according to their research purposes while considering several variables of interest and avoiding item-selection problems commonly present when comparing responses to neutral and emotional items."
https://openalex.org/W2963641510,"The distal tubule and collecting duct in kidney regulate water homeostasis. TMOD1 is an actin capping protein that plays an important role in controlling the organization of actin filaments. In this study, we found TMOD1 was specifically expressed in distal tubules and collecting ducts. To investigate the role of TMOD1, we created Tmod1flox/flox mice and bred them with Ksp-Cre mice to generate tubule-specific Tmod1 knockout mice, Tmod1flox/flox/Ksp-Cre+ (designated as TFK). As compared with control mice, TFK mice showed oliguria, hyperosmolality urine, and high blood pressure. To determine the mechanisms underlying this phenotype, we performed label-free quantitative proteomics on kidneys of TFK and control mice. Total of 83 proteins were found differentially expressed. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that biological processes, including protein phosphorylation and metabolic process, were involved in TMOD1 regulatory network. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that multiple pathways, such as phosphatidylinositol signaling system and GnRH signaling pathway, were strongly associated with Tmod1 knockout. Western blot validated the down-regulation of three proteins, TGFBR2, SLC25A11, and MTFP1, in kidneys of TFK mice. Our study provides valuable information on the molecular functions and the regulatory network of Tmod1 gene in kidney, as well as the new mechanisms for the regulation of water balance."
https://openalex.org/W2963807575,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common, chronic disease that is closely associated with anthropometric indices related to obesity. However, no study published to date has simultaneously examined the associations of T2DM with anthropometrics, bone mineral density (BMD), and body composition variables. The present study aimed to evaluate the associations of T2DM with anthropometrics, BMD and body composition variables and to identify the best indicator of T2DM in Korean adults.The data used in this study were obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 2008 to 2011. A total of 7,835 participants aged from 40 to 90 years were included in this study. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the significance of differences between the groups with and without T2DM, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUCs) curves were calculated to compare the predictive power of all variables.In men, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) displayed the strongest association with T2DM (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.838 [1.513-2.233], adjusted p<0.001), and waist circumference (WC) and WHtR were the best indicators (WC: AUC = 0.662 [0.639-0.685], WHtR: AUC = 0.680 [0.658-0.703]) of T2DM among all the variables. In women, left leg (LL) and right leg (RL) fat displayed strong negative associations with T2DM (LL fat: adjusted OR = 0.367 [0.321-0.419], adjusted p<0.001, RL fat: adjusted OR = 0.375 [0.329-0.428], adjusted p<0.001), and WC and WHtR were excellent indicators (WC: AUC = 0.730 [0.709-0.750], WHtR: AUC = 0.747 [0.728-0.766]) of T2DM among all the variables. In particular, the WHtR in men and LL and RL fat in women exhibited the strongest associations with T2DM, and the predictive power of the WC and WHtR was stronger than BMD, fat, and muscle mass variables in both men and women. Additionally, the predictive power of the WC and WHtR was stronger in women than in men.Of the anthropometric indices, BMD, and body fat and muscle variables, the best indicators of T2DM were WC and WHtR in both Korean men and women. The results of the present investigation will provide basic information for clinical studies of patients with T2DM and evidence for the prevention and management of T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2963526609,"Twin-arginine-dependent translocases transport folded proteins across bacterial, archaeal, and chloroplast membranes. Upon substrate binding, they assemble from hexahelical TatC and single-spanning TatA and TatB membrane proteins. Although structural and functional details of individual Tat subunits have been reported previously, the sequence and dynamics of Tat translocase assembly remain to be determined. Employing the zero-space cross-linker N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) in combination with LC-MS/MS, we identified as yet unknown intra- and intermolecular contact sites of TatB and TatC. In addition to their established intramembrane binding sites, both proteins were thus found to contact each other through the soluble N terminus of TatC and the interhelical linker region around the conserved glutamyl residue Glu49 of TatB from Escherichia coli. Functional analyses suggested that by interacting with the TatC N terminus, TatB improves the formation of a proficient substrate recognition site of TatC. The Glu49 region of TatB was found also to contact distinct downstream sites of a neighboring TatB molecule and to thereby mediate oligomerization of TatB within the TatBC receptor complex. Finally, we show that global DCCD-mediated cross-linking of TatB and TatC in membrane vesicles or, alternatively, creating covalently linked TatC oligomers prevents TatA from occupying a position close to the TatBC-bound substrate. Collectively, our results are consistent with a circular arrangement of the TatB and TatC units within the TatBC receptor complex and with TatA entering the interior TatBC-binding cavity through lateral gates between TatBC protomers.

https://openalex.org/W2963583188,"A new fast busbar protection algorithm based on the comparison of the similarity of back-wave waveforms is proposed in this paper. The S-transform is performed on the back-wave from each defected transmission line connected to the busbar, and the protection criterion is thus constructed by using the Euclidean distance to analyze the similarity of the back-waves, with the implementation of the S-transform between the transmission lines. When a fault occurs internally on the busbar, the Euclidean distance of the S-transformed back-wave between each associated transmission line is small, and there is a remarkable similarity between the waveform. When a fault occurs externally on the busbar, the Euclidean distance of the S-transformed backward traveling wave between the faulty line and the nonfaulty line is larger than that between the nonfaulty lines. The wave-forms of the faulty line and the nonfaulty line bear little similarity, while there is a striking similarity between the nonfaulty lines. Therefore, a protection criterion is established according to the ratio between the maximal similarity and the minimal similarity to discriminate the internal and external faults of the busbar zones. The simulation results show that the proposed busbar protection method can discriminate the internal and external faults of busbar zones in a sensitive and reliable way."
https://openalex.org/W4251405985,"Precision medicine might be the response to the recent questioning of the use of metformin as an anticancer drug in colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, in order to establish properly its benefits, metformin application needs to be assayed on the different progression stages of CRC. In this way, intestinal organoids imply a more physiological tool, representing a new therapeutic opportunity for CRC personalized treatment to assay tumor stage-dependent drugs. The previously reported lipid metabolism-related axis, Acyl-CoA synthetases/ Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (ACSLs/SCD), stimulates colon cancer progression and metformin is able to rescue the invasive and migratory phenotype conferred to cancer cells upon this axis overexpression. Therefore, we checked ACSL/SCD axis status, its regulatory miRNAs and the effect of metformin treatment in intestinal organoids with the most common acquired mutations in a sporadic CRC (CRC-like organoids) as a model for specific and personalized treatment. Despite ACSL4 expression is upregulated progressively in CRC-like organoids, metformin is able to downregulate its expression, especially in the first two stages (I, II). Besides, organoids are clearly more sensitive in the first stage (Apc mutated) to metformin than current chemotherapeutic drugs such as fluorouracil (5-FU). Metformin performs an independent “Warburg effect” blockade to cancer progression and is able to reduce crypt stem cell markers expression such as LGR5+. These results suggest a putative increased efficiency of the use of metformin in early stages of CRC than in advanced disease."
