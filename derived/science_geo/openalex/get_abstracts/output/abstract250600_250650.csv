https://openalex.org/W2118274513,"We directly observed real-time production of single protein molecules in individual Escherichia coli cells. A fusion protein of a fast-maturing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and a membrane-targeting peptide was expressed under a repressed condition. The membrane-localized YFP can be detected with single-molecule sensitivity. We found that the protein molecules are produced in bursts, with each burst originating from a stochastically transcribed single messenger RNA molecule, and that protein copy numbers in the bursts follow a geometric distribution. The quantitative study of low-level gene expression demonstrates the potential of single-molecule experiments in elucidating the workings of fundamental biological processes in living cells."

https://openalex.org/W2104069712,"We discovered that when adult rats experience an association between visual stimuli and subsequent rewards, the responses of a substantial fraction of neurons in the primary visual cortex evolve from those that relate solely to the physical attributes of the stimuli to those that accurately predict the timing of reward. In addition to revealing a remarkable type of response plasticity in adult V1, these data demonstrate that reward-timing activity—a “higher” brain function—can occur very early in sensory-processing paths. These findings challenge the traditional interpretation of activity in the primary visual cortex."

Sensitive intracavity absorption information is simultaneously available across 100 nanometers in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. Real-time, quantitative measurements were made of the trace presence, the transition strengths and linewidths, and the population redistributions due to collisions and the temperature changes for molecules such as C 2 H 2 , O 2 , H 2 O, and NH 3 ."

A comprehensive survey of ligand-receptor interactions was performed using a flow cytometry-based assay. All ligands engaged between one and five receptors, whereas most receptors only bound one to three ligands. The receptors DR6, RELT, TROY, NGFR, and mouse TNFRH3 did not interact with any of the known TNFSF ligands, suggesting that they either bind other types of ligands, function in a ligand-independent manner, or bind ligands that remain to be identified. The study revealed that ligand-receptor pairs are either cross-reactive between human and mouse (e.g. Tweak/Fn14, RANK/RANKL), strictly species-specific (GITR/GITRL), or partially species-specific (e.g. OX40/OX40L, CD40/CD40L). Interestingly, the receptor binding patterns of lymphotoxinα andαβ are redundant in the human but not in the mouse system. Ligand oligomerization allowed detection of weak interactions, such as that of human TNF with mouse TNFR2. In addition, mouse APRIL exists as two different splice variants differing by a single amino acid. Although human APRIL does not interact with BAFF-R, the shorter variant of mouse APRIL exhibits weak but detectable binding to mouse BAFF-R.

In Drosophila, the single TNF homologue Eiger induces c-Jun N-terminal kinase-mediated cell death and has been shown to modulate host response to Salmonella infection (2Brandt S.M. Dionne M.S.

Biol. 2003; 262: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In birds and mammals, however, most TNFSF and TNFRSF members are implicated in the development, maintenance, and function of immune cells and secondary lymphoid organs and participate in other functions, such as bone homeostasis (1Locksley R.M.

TNF family ligands are type II transmembrane proteins with an extracellular, homotrimeric C-terminal TNF homology domain that is frequently released as a soluble cytokine upon proteolytic processing (11Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Lymphotoxin β is remarkable in that it cannot form homotrimers but instead heterotrimerizes with lymphotoxin α (12Browning J.L. Ngam-ek A. Lawton P. DeMarinis J. Tizard R. Chow E.P. Hession C.

Receptors are usually type I and sometimes type III (BCMA, TACI, BAFF-R, and XEDAR) membrane proteins, with the exception of OPG and DcR3, which are secreted. Receptors are characterized by the presence of one to four cysteine-rich domains (CRD) in their extracellular portion. Those receptors with several CRDs adopt an elongated structure and bind at the interface between two ligand monomers within a trimer, whereas single CRD receptors are more compact and contact a single ligand monomer in a trimeric ligand (13Liu Y.

Generally, one trimeric ligand engages three monomeric receptors, a key event for the activation of intracellular signaling pathways. The TNF ligands have been shown to bind to one, two, or more different receptors and vice versa. For example, RANKL promotes bone resorption by stimulating the maturation of osteoclast precursors through the membrane-bound receptor RANK and is regulated through binding to the soluble decoy receptor OPG (10Tanaka S.

Experimental data regarding TNFSF-TNFRSF interactions in human and mouse and more specifically those addressing interspecies cross-reactivities are scattered in the literature (if available at all) and rely on different experimental settings or on specific reagents. In this study, we have conducted a systematic survey of TNFSF-TNFRSF interactions and report reactivities and cross-reactivities of human and mouse proteins. Cell Lines and Reagents—HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5 μg/ml each penicillin and streptomycin. Heparin (Liquemin 5000 IU/ml) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The rat IgG2a monoclonal antibody anti-TRAILR3 (LEIA) was purchased from Axxora (San Diego, CA), the biotinylated anti-FLAG M2 antibody from Sigma, PE-coupled streptavidin from eBiosciences, and PE-coupled goat anti-human IgG and PE-coupled goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL).

Although we did not determine the ratio of LTα1β2 and LTα2β1 in these preparations, they probably contained a mixture of both. hTNF-(85–233), mTNF-(76–235), mBAFF-(127–309), mAPRIL(ΔA112)-(98–232), and mAPRIL(A112)-(98–233) were also cloned into the pFLAG vector.

An expression vector for Receptor:Fc has been described previously (21Schneider P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 322-345Google Scholar) and was used for the expression of hCD27-(1–191), mCD27-(1–182), mDcTRAILR1-(1–158), mDcTRAI-LR2-(1–171), hFas-(1–170), mFas-(1–169), hHVEM-(1–200), mHVE-M-(1–206), hLTβR-(1–220), mLTβR-(1–217), hOPG-(1–202), mOPG-(1–214), mTNFRH3-(1–162), hTRAIL-R1-(1–239), hTRAIL-R2-(1–212), hTRAIL-R3-(1–240), and hTRAIL-R4-(1–211). Full-length hFasL-(1–281), mFasL-(1–279), hTRAIL-(1–281) (FLAG), mTRAIL-(1–291) (FLAG), hCD27L-(1–193) (FLAG), mCD27L-(1–195), hLIGHT-(1–240), and mLIGHT-(1–239) were cloned in the PCR3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Transfection—For secreted proteins, 293T cells transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure were grown in serum-free Opti-MEM I medium for 4–7 days. Supernatants were collected and frozen until use. In one instance (see Fig. 2D), supernatants were concentrated 60× before use. When concentration is indicated, protein concentration was estimated by immunoblot using anti-FLAG or anti-Fc antibodies with purified proteins of known concentration as standards. For flow cytometry stainings, 293T cells were co-transfected overnight with expression constructs for the receptor of interest and EGFP, washed and cultured for an additional 24 h in complete medium. For staining and analysis, cells were detached by pipetting. Flow Cytometry Staining—Stainings (∼2 × 105 transfected 293T cells) were performed in round-bottomed 96-well plates for 20 min on ice with either (a) Fc-tagged ligands followed by PE-coupled goat anti-human IgG, (b) Fc-tagged receptor followed by PE-coupled goat anti-human IgG, (c) 0.5 μg of LEIA antibody followed by PE-coupled goat anti-rat IgG, or (d) FLAG-tagged ligands followed by biotinylated anti-FLAG M2 antibody and PE-coupled streptavidin. Stainings were performed with 5–15 μl (∼10–50 ng) of recombinant proteins in Opti-MEM supernatants in a final volume of 25 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 5% fetal calf serum. Heparin (0.1 μl) was added in all stainings to prevent unspecific binding of recombinant proteins to glycosaminoglycans (20Ingold K. Zumsteg A. Tardivel A. Huard B. Steiner Q.G. Cachero T.G. Qiang F.

The cells were analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) using the CellQuest program. GPI-anchored TNF Receptors Bind Cognate Recombinant Fc:Ligands Fusion Proteins at the Cell Surface—We have developed an assay to monitor TNFSF-TNFRSF interactions, which requires no antibodies specific for the ligands and receptors of interest, no protein purification, and which contains an internal negative control. In this assay, the extracellular domain of each receptor is expressed as a fusion protein with the C-terminal portion of TRAIL-R3 in 293T cells, together with EGFP. The C-terminal portion of TRAIL-R3 contains a repetitive amino acid sequence and a GPI anchor that targets the receptor to the plasma membrane (22Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Thome M. Hofmann K. Holler N. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 23Legler D.F. Doucey M.A. Schneider P. Chapatte L. Bender F.C. Bron C. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of TRAIL-R3 is specifically recognized by a monoclonal antibody (LEIA) that allows monitoring of surface expression of the chimeric receptors. Fusing receptors to a glycolipid anchor circumvents problems that could be associated with the use of full-length receptors, namely induction of apoptosis, intracellular retention, or, in the case of OPG and DcR3, secretion. Finally, receptor-expressing cells co-express EGFP, whereas untransfected, EGFP-negative cells serve as internal negative controls. Ligands are expressed as soluble fusion proteins comprising the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 and the TNF homology domain of TNFSF members. These fusion proteins are predicted to form hexamers (i.e. to contain two trimeric ligands) and to display higher avidity for their receptors than a regular trimer (18Holler N. Tardivel A. Kovacsovics-Bankowski M. Hertig S. Gaide O. Martinon F. Tinel A. Deperthes D. Calderara S. Schulthess T. Engel J. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1428-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The Fc is detected with a secondary PE-labeled antibody directed against human IgG1. Cells co-transfected with EGFP, and various receptor-GPI constructs were screened for Fc:ligands binding. Although background staining of the various ligands varied, more than a hundred specific interactions were readily identified based on the curved appearance of the scattergrams (Fig. 1). Under these experimental conditions, there were several exceptions. Fc:mLIGHT (but not Fc:hLIGHT) failed to bind its cognate receptors, despite the fact that the portions of hLIGHT and mLIGHT contained in these constructs were exactly equivalent. The same was true for Fc:mTRAIL. In addition, Fc:hTRAIL and Fc:mFasL did not recognize at least one of their described binding partners (Fig. 1 and data not shown). This could result from Cys-230 oxidation in TRAIL (25Bodmer J.L. Meier P. Tschopp J. Schneider P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20632-20637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Hymowitz S.G. O'Connell M.P. Ultsch M.H. Hurst A. Totpal K. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Kelley R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), from putative detrimental effects of the Fc portion on some ligands in the Fc:ligand fusion proteins, or could be due to the portion of the ligand expressed. Fc:mFasL was expressed as two constructs, one containing the TNF homology domain only (data not shown) and the other containing the entire extracellular domain (Fig. 1). Only the long form demonstrated binding to hDcR3, a described receptor for hFasL (27Pitti R.M. Marsters S.A. Lawrence D.A. Roy M. Kischkel F.C. Dowd P. Huang A. Donahue C.J. Sherwood S.W. Baldwin D.T. Godowski P.J. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Hillan K.J. Cohen R.L. Goddard A.D. Botstein D. Ashkenazi A. Nature. 1998; 396: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), but neither form interacted with mFas. We therefore expressed mFasL, mLIGHT, mTRAIL, and hTRAIL as untagged, full-length proteins in 293T cells and detected interactions with recombinant receptor:Fc fusion proteins. In this format, these four ligands interacted with their cognate receptors (Fig. 2). mLIGHT interacted readily with mLTβR, but only weak binding to mHVEM was observed (Fig. 2D). Simple Interactions—Some interactions involve a single ligand binding to a single receptor. This is the case for the following pairs: 4–1BBL/4–1BB, CD27L/CD27, CD30L/CD30, CD40L/CD40, EDA1/EDAR, EDA2/XEDAR, GITRL/GITR, OX40L/OX40, and TWEAK/Fn14. m4-1BBL and mGITRL did not recognize the corresponding human receptors, whereas hCD40L, hGITRL, and hOX40L did not bind the mouse receptors. In addition, h4–1BBL interacted only weakly with m4–1BB, as seen from the convex shape of the scattergram, in which only highly transfected cells bound the ligand (Fig. 1). An interaction between TWEAK(Apo3L) and DR3 has been reported in an earlier study (28Marsters S.A. Sheridan J.P. Pitti R.M. Brush J. Goddard A. Ashkenazi A. Curr.

Instead, TWEAK interacts with Fn14, and DR3 binds to TL1A (Fig. 1) (32Wiley S.R. Cassiano L. Lofton T. Davis-Smith T. Winkles J.A. Lindner V. Liu H. Daniel T.O. Smith C.A. Fanslow W.C.

The RANKL, TRAIL Network—Expression of soluble TRAIL in 293 cells results in the oxidation of Cys-230, which is required for the chelation of a zinc atom at the center of the trimer, and may explain the total or partial lack of activity of Fc:hTRAIL and Fc:mTRAIL (25Bodmer J.L.

However, the membrane-bound forms of both human and mouse TRAIL were suitable for this study of receptor binding and allowed us to reproduce the previously published interactions (Fig. 2A) (34Schneider P.

The Immediate TNF Network—TNF, LTα, LTβ, LIGHT, TL1A, and FasL share at least one receptor with another ligand of the immediate TNF family. We have confirmed the published interactions within this subfamily (Figs. 1, 2, and 5). Curiously, in our hands, hDcR3:Fc failed to bind efficiently to its three cognate ligands LIGHT, FasL, and TL1A (data not shown), but the same portion of DcR3 fused to the GPI anchor of TRAIL-R3 did show an interaction (Fig. 1). It has been shown that DcR3 specifically loses its ability to interact with FasL (but not LIGHT) upon proteolytic cleavage at residue Arg-247, which separates the CRDs from the C-terminal extension (35Wroblewski V.J. McCloud C. Davis K. Manetta J. Micanovic R. Witcher D.R. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast to DcR3-Ig, GPI-anchored DcR3 may escape proteolytic processing or maintain a conformation that allows ligand binding. We have not been able to test the hDcR3-mLIGHT interaction. There were marked differences in the patterns of interaction of the lymphotoxins with their receptors in mouse and human. In the human, both LTα and LTαβ interacted with three receptors each, whereas in the mouse, LTα bound specifically to TNFR1 and LTαβ to LTβR. This raises the question as to whether the interactions of human LTα with HVEM or human LTαβ with TNFR1 are physiologically relevant or whether they represent weak interactions with no real signaling potential in vivo. Fc:ligands allow the detection of weak interactions, because they are predicted to contain more than one trimeric ligand (18Holler N. Tardivel A. Kovacsovics-Bankowski M. Hertig S. Gaide O.

Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1428-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and to display higher avidity for the receptors than regular trimeric soluble ligands. This is illustrated by the unexpected observation that human TNF did bind to mouse TNFR2 in our experimental system (Fig. 1), although it is known that, under physiological conditions, hTNF does not bind and cannot activate mTNFR2 (36Ranges G.E. Bombara M.P. Aiyer R.A. Rice G.G. Palladino Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1203-1208PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ameloot P. Fiers W. De Bleser P. Ware C.F. Vandenabeele P. Brouckaert P. J. Biol.

We tested whether this result was because of the increased avidity of Fc:hTNF or to polymorphisms in mTNFR2. Indeed, non-obese diabetic and 129/SvJ mouse strains contain the T102S and I108T polymorphisms (38Hurle B. Segade F. Rodriguez R. Ramos S. Lazo P.S. Genomics. 1998; 52: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 39Powell E.E. Wicker L.S. Peterson L.B. Todd J.A. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 726-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A) that could potentially alter the specificity for hTNF as they correspond to amino acids that are present in the ligand binding domain of human TNFR2 (Fig. 3A) (16Banner D.W.

However, both polymorphic forms of mTNFR2 bound to Fc:hTNF nearly as efficiently as the positive controls hTNFR2, hTNFR1, and mTNFR1 but only weakly bound trimeric human TNF (Fig. 3, B and C). We conclude that the use of Fc:ligands, which may mimic membrane-bound ligands, contributes to the sensitivity of the screen by allowing detection of weaker interactions. However, additional experiments are required to determine whether a given interaction is biologically relevant. The BAFF and APRIL Network—The ligands BAFF and APRIL share two receptors, TACI and BCMA. However, only BAFF can bind to BAFF-R. We indeed confirmed these findings with hBAFF and hAPRIL (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, mAPRIL interacted with mBAFF-R, although the binding was weaker than that observed with mBAFF (Fig. 1). To our knowledge, the binding of mAPRIL to mBAFF-R has not been reported previously in the literature. We noticed that APRIL exists as two splice variants differing by a single amino acid residue, Ala-112, as a result of differential usage of alternative splice acceptor sites that are separated by only three nucleotides (Fig. 4A). A similar case has been described for EDA isoforms that differ by two amino acid residues (40Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M.

(2004) FEBS Lett. 577, 563–569). Here we show that the alkylamides dodeca-2E,4E,8Z,10Z-tetraenoic acid isobutylamide (A1) and dodeca-2E,4E-dienoic acid isobutylamide (A2) bind to the CB2 receptor more strongly than the endogenous cannabinoids. The Ki values of A1 and A2 (CB2 ∼60 nm;CB1 >1500 nm) were determined by displacement of the synthetic high affinity cannabinoid ligand [3H]CP-55,940. Molecular modeling suggests that alkylamides bind in the solvent-accessible cavity in CB2, directed by H-bonding and π -π interactions. In a screen with 49 other pharmacologically relevant receptors, it could be shown that A1 and A2 specifically bind to CB2 and CB1. A1 and A2 elevated total intracellular Ca2+ in CB2-positive but not in CB2-negative promyelocytic HL60 cells, an effect that was inhibited by the CB2 antagonist SR144528. At 50 nm, A1, A2, and the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide (CB2 Ki >200 nm) up-regulated constitutive interleukin (IL)-6 expression in human whole blood in a seemingly CB2-dependent manner. A1, A2, anandamide, the CB2 antagonist SR144528 (Ki <10 nm), and also the non-CB2-binding alkylamide undeca-2E-ene,8,10-diynoic acid isobutylamide all significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β, and IL-12p70 expression (5–500 nm) in a CB2-independent manner. Alkylamides and anandamide also showed weak differential effects on anti-CD3-versus anti-CD28-stimulated cytokine expression in human whole blood. Overall, alkylamides, anandamide, and SR144528 potently inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in human whole blood and exerted modulatory effects on cytokine expression, but these effects are not exclusively related to CB2 binding.

Purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea angustifolia) preparations are widely used herbal medicines for the treatment of the common cold and upper respiratory infections (1Goel V.

Pharm. Pharmacol. 2005; 57: 929-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that Echinacea affords its benefits through interactions with the immune system (3Randolph R.K. Gellenbeck K. Stonebrook K. Brovelli E. Qian Y. Bankaitis-Davis D. Cheronis J. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but data on the clinical efficacy of Echinacea in the treatment of the common cold and upper respiratory infections are contradictory (4Turner R.B.

In contrast to the significant investments into the clinical assessment of the efficacy of Echinacea (6Percival S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of action of this medicinal plant has remained elusive, and comprehensive studies on the immunomodulatory actions of Echinacea constituents are scarce. We have reported previously that unsaturated fatty acid N-alkylamides (alkylamides) from Echinacea preparations can modulate the expression of TNF-α 2The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; 2-AG, 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol; CB,cannabinoidreceptor;FACS,fluorescence-activatedcellsorting;GM-CSF,granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; IL, interleukin; Mϕs, macrophages; PLC, phospholipase C; PMA, phorbol ester (12-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate); BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; A1, dodeca-2E,4E,8Z,10Z-tetraenoic acid isobutylamide; A2, dodeca-2E,4E-dienoic acid isobutylamide; A3, undeca-2E-ene,8,10-diynoic acid isobutylamide; CBA, cytometric bead array. in human monocytes and macrophages (Mϕs) in vitro (7Gertsch J. Schoop R. Kuenzle U. Suter A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We ascribed these effects to interactions of alkylamides with the cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) on monocytes, resulting in the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and of the nuclear factor κB(NF-κB), which ultimately leads to TNF-α mRNA expression (7Gertsch J. Schoop R. Kuenzle U. Suter A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the same study it was demonstrated that alkylamides inhibit LPS-stimulated TNF-α protein expression from isolated monocytes/Mϕs. These findings were independently confirmed in a more recent study, which demonstrated binding of alkylamides from E. angustifolia to rodent cannabinoid receptors and inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase, the enzyme that controls the half-life of the endogenous cannabinoid ligand anandamide (8Woelkart K. Xu W. Pei Y. Makriyannis A. Picone R.P. Bauer R. Planta Med. 2005; 71: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cannabinoid receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family and are ubiquitously found in the central nervous system and in the periphery. So far, two types of receptors have been characterized, which are referred to as type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2) receptors. The CB1 receptor is predominantly but not exclusively found in the nervous system, whereas the CB2 receptor is mainly expressed on immune cells and in the spleen (9De Petrocellis L. Cascio M.G. Di Marzo V. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 10Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu Shaar M. Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4180) Google Scholar). Because of its role in the cellular immune system, the CB2 receptor is of particular interest for our ongoing studies on the immunomodulatory activity of alkylamides from Echinacea. In fact, the CB2 receptor is abundantly expressed in different types of inflammatory and immune-competent cells (11Galiegue S. Mary S. Marchand J. Dussossoy D. Carriere D. Carayon P. Bouaboula M.

It is also well established that cannabinoids mediate both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on the immune system by modulating cytokine expression (18Klein T.W. Newton C. Larsen K. Lu L. Perkins I. Nong L. Friedman H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 19Croxford J.L. Yamamura T. J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 166: 3-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These differential effects are also dependent on ligand concentration (19Croxford J.L. Yamamura T. J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 166: 3-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanisms of the concentration effects are not yet understood. Recent studies also highlight the potential of CB2 receptor ligands in the treatment of cancer (20Sarfaraz S. Afaq F. Adhami V.M. Mukhtar H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 21Blazquez C. Casanova M.L. Planas A. Pulgar T.G. Del Villanueva C. Fernandez-Acenero M.J. Aragones J. Huffman J.W.

Zimmer A. Frossard J.L. Mach F. Nature. 2005; 434: 782-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Therefore, the general aim of this study was to characterize the interaction of alkylamides from the medicinal plant Echinacea with the human CB2 receptor with respect to binding affinity, ligand specificity, and functional consequences at physiological drug concentrations in cellular systems in vitro. Binding studies were based on radioligand displacement assays with the bicyclic cannabinoid ligand [3H]CP-55,940, which has played an important role in the discovery of the cannabinoid receptors (23Devane W.A. Dysarz F.A. II I Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 605-613PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kaminski N.E. Abood M.E. Kessler F.K. Martin B.R. Schatz A.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 736-742PubMed Google Scholar), and which strongly binds to the cannabinoid-binding site in CB2 (Ki = 0.7 nm). Despite the fact that more than one plausible binding site in CB2 has been postulated (25Xie X.Q. Chen J.Z. Billings E.M. Proteins. 2003; 53: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the CP-55,940-binding site is shared by all cannabinoids reported so far. The experimental investigations were complemented by molecular modeling studies based on a previously established homology model (25Xie X.Q. Chen J.Z. Billings E.M. Proteins. 2003; 53: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). No experimental information is currently available on the structure of the receptor. We have shown previously that alkylamides inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP production (7Gertsch J. Schoop R. Kuenzle U. Suter A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) via the CB2 receptor. To further characterize the direct functional effects of alkylamide binding to the CB2 receptor, the total intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in both CB2-expressing (CB2-positive) and CB2-nonexpressing (CB2-negative) HL60 cells was measured. In addition to defined cellular systems, we have also investigated the effects of nanomolar concentrations of alkylamides on cytokine expression in human peripheral whole blood cultures, both under nonstimulating and stimulating conditions. Immunomodulatory actions of endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids have been investigated in numerous studies (18Klein T.W. Newton C. Larsen K. Lu L. Perkins I. Nong L. Friedman H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), mostly performed with isolated cells or transformed cell lines, but only sparse data exist for ex vivo studies or studies with whole blood. Recent reports have shown that plasma levels of alkylamides in the lower nanomolar range can be achieved in humans after oral administration of commercial alkylamide-containing Echinacea preparations (26Woelkart K. Koidl C. Grisold A. Gangemi J.D. Turner R.B. Marth E. Bauer R. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2005; 45: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Matthias A. Addison R.S. Penman K.G. Dickinson R.G. Bone K.M. Lehmann R.P. Life Sci. 2005; 77: 2018-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). So far, however, it is not known whether alkylamides can exert immunomodulatory effects via the CB2 receptor at such low concentrations. Whole blood rather than isolated leukocytes were chosen for these studies in order to simulate physiological conditions as closely as possible. Whole blood studies were performed with three major alkylamides from Echinacea, the endogenous cannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide), and the CB2 antagonist SR144528 (28Calignano A. La Rana G. Giuffrida A. Piomelli D. Nature. 1998; 394: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human promyelocytic leukemia non-CB2-expressing (negative) HL60 cells (obtained from Prof. Dr. Verena Dirsch, Vienna, Austria) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 g/ml fungizone (amphotericin B), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen). Human promyelocytic leukemia CB2-expressing (positive) HL60 cells (obtained from the ATCC, CCL-240) were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 4 mm l-glutamine and 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate (ATCC, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1 g/ml fungizone (amphotericin B), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. The human CB2-expressing CHO-K1 cells were grown in the same medium as the CB2-negative HL60 cells but supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 (10131-027; Invitrogen). All cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Human Peripheral Whole Blood Cultures—10 ml of peripheral whole blood was obtained from healthy volunteers in the early afternoon by a medical doctor. The blood was collected into heparinized tubes (BD Vacutainer Systems) and gently shaken for 1 min. 200-μl portions were then immediately aliquoted into a 96-well plate under sterile conditions. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. Test compounds and vehicle controls were added. After 45 min of incubation in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2, stimulation of cells was initiated by addition of either 313 ng/ml LPS, 1 μg/ml αCD3 (combined with 1.5 μg/ml PMA), or 0.5 μg/ml αCD28 (combined with 1.5 μg/mlPMA) to the blood culture under gentle stirring. Volumes of stimulatory mixtures were set to 2 μl. PMA stimulation alone did not markedly induce cytokines in whole blood. Again, vehicle controls (ethanol or H2O) of the same dilutions were included. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 18 h. After incubation the plates were centrifuged at room temperature for 5 min at 450 rpm in an MSE Mistral 3000i centrifuge to facilitate plasma collection. For each assay at least three experiments were performed in triplicate with blood from at least three different donors (total of at least nine measurements). FACS Analysis of CB2 Expression—HL60 or CB2-transfected CHO-K1 cells (106) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.1% NaN3 and 2% fetal bovine serum and incubated (1:100) with the rabbit polyclonal CB2-specific antibody (3561) for 45 min on ice in the dark. After two washing steps, the cells were incubated (1:32) with a monoclonal anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody for 45 min on ice in the dark. The cells were washed twice and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% NaN3 and 1% p-formaldehyde prior to analysis on a FACScan cytometer (BD Biosciences). Measurements were carried out with the CellQuest™ software, and relative expressions were compared with secondary antibody controls. Radioligand Displacement Assays on CB1 and CB2 Receptors—For the CB1 receptor, binding experiments were performed in the presence of 0.39 nm of the radioligand [3H]CP-55,940 at 30 °C in siliconized glass vials together with 7.16 μg of membrane recombinantly overexpressing CB1 (RBHCB1M; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), which was resuspended in 0.2 ml (final volume) of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 5mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Test compounds were present at varying concentrations, and the nonspecific binding of the radioligand was determined in the presence of 10 μm CP-55,940. After 90 min of incubation, the suspension was rapidly filtered through 0.05% polyethyleneimine pre-soaked GF/C glass fiber filters on a 96-well cell harvester and washed nine times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Radioactivity on filters was measured with a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter in 3 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation liquid. Data collected from three independent experiments performed in triplicate were normalized between 100 and 0% specific binding for [3H]CP-55,940. These data were graphically linearized by projecting Hill plots, which allowed the calculation of IC50 values. Derived from the dissociation constant (KD) of [3 H]CP-55,940 and the concentration-dependent displacement (IC50 value), inhibition constants (Ki) of competitor compounds were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Ki = IC50/(1 + L/KD)) (29Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar). For CB2 receptor binding studies, 3.8 μg of membrane recombinantly overexpressing CB2 (RBXCB2M; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was resuspended in 0.6 ml of binding buffer (see above) together with 0.11 nm of the radioligand [3H]CP-55,940. The CB2-binding assay was conducted in the same manner as for CB1. Western Blotting—HL60 cells and CB2-transfected CHO-K1 cells were resuspended and homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (15 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) followed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with buffer A and centrifuged again at 40,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The membrane was resuspended in buffer B (75 mm Tris-HCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.5) and stored at –80 °C until used. All membrane preparation steps were performed in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (P8340; Sigma). Membrane proteins were separated on 4–12% Nupage™ Novex BisTris pre-cast gels (Invitrogen) under denaturing and nonreducing conditions and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blocking of membrane, incubation of the primary and secondary antibodies, and detection by chemiluminescence following ECL Plus Western blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Receptor Screen—The receptor screen was carried out at the Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel, Switzerland. 10 μm of test compound was subjected to cell membrane preparations from cell lines overexpressing specific receptors in order to test for competitive binding with the corresponding radioligands. Inhibitions of >50% were significantly higher than background interference and represent specific positive interactions with the radioligand-binding sites. CB2 Homology Model and Docking Study—The program HOMOLOGY/InsightII (MSI-Biosym InsightII/Homology version 98, MSI Inc., San Diego) was used to generate the initial three-dimensional structural model of the CB2 receptor based on the x-ray crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (30Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I. Le Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment among 10 selective GPCRs, including the CB2 receptor and bovine rhodopsin from the rhodopsin GPCR family, was first performed to distinguish the seven transmembrane domains and extra- and intra-loop regions of the receptors, and the results were refined and evaluated by mutation scores, pairwise hydrophobicity profiles, and Kyte-Doolittle plots. The CB2 three-dimensional structural model was then constructed by mapping the CB2 sequence on the homologous residues of the rhodopsin x-ray structure in 7TM regions and searching for homologous C-α backbone sequences in published structures from the Protein Data Bank in loop regions. The energy minimization and molecular dynamics (MD/MM) simulation was finally carried out to optimize the CB2 three-dimensional structural model (25Xie X.Q. Chen J.Z. Billings E.M. Proteins. 2003; 53: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To explore the possible binding pocket or domain(s) inside the CB2 receptor, molecular surface and physicochemical property maps, i.e. electrostatic and hydrophobicity (lipophilicity) potentials, were generated on the Connolly solvent-accessible surface by using the MOLCAD program (SYBYL7.0) (molecular modeling software packages, version 7.0, Tripos Associates, Inc., St. Louis). MOLCAD's rendering techniques allow the rapid calculation and display of property-coded surfaces for the molecular recognition. The generated surface property maps were further examined for the complementary biological data. The alkylamide docking and CB2 protein-ligand complex studies were performed on the basis of the following docking protocol by using Tripos molecular modeling packages Sybyl7.0 on an SGI octane computer. First, a three-dimensional structure of the alkylamide molecule was built by the Sketch module in Sybyl7.0 and optimized by using the Tripos force field. The initial docking position of alkylamide molecules was established inside the hypothetic binding pocket that was defined on the basis of the MOLCAD-generated solvent-accessible cavity model of the CB2 receptor. Then the receptor-ligand binding geometry was optimized by flexible docking using the FlexiDock module in Sybyl7.0. During flexible docking simulation, the single bonds of the alkylamide and all side chains within the defined binding region, or 3 Å around the target ligand, of the CB2 receptor were defined as rotatable or flexible bonds, and the ligand was allowed to move flexibly within the tentative binding site/pocket. The atomic charges were recalculated by using Kollman all-atom for the protein and Gasteiger-Hückel for the ligand. The interaction energy was calculated using van der Waals, electrostatic, and torsional energy terms of the Tripos force field. The iterations were set at 20,000 generations for genetic algorithms. Subsequently, further optimization was carried out on the FlexiDock-generated CB2 receptor-ligand complexes by using energy minimization and molecular dynamics. In this study, the AMBER force field along with a 15-Å cut-off distance for nonbonded interactions was applied to optimizetheintermediateligand-boundCB2receptormodel.Adistance-dependent (ϵ = 5r) dielectric function was used. Before the optimization, a binding pocket was defined to include the ligand and the residues within 7.5 Å around the ligand in the complex. The molecular dynamics protocol consisted of the following. (i) Initial minimization for 500 iterations of steepest descents, followed by conjugate gradients minimization, until the root mean square deviation became less than 0.1 kcal ·mol–1 ·Å–1. (ii) MD simulations were then performed at a constant temperature of 1000 K and a time step of 1 fs for a total of 50 ps. Initially, a constraint was applied to keep the backbone atoms in the seven transmembrane domains inside the binding pocket and all of other atoms outside the binding pocket of the CB2 receptor. Fifty representative snapshots of the ligand receptor complex from the molecular dynamics run were retrieved, minimized with 500 iterations of steepest descent, and followed by conjugate gradient minimization until the maximum derivative was less than 0.1 kcal ·mol–1 ·Å–1. The minimization and molecular dynamics simulation of the ligand receptor complex were further analyzed and evaluated as described later. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—HL60 CB2-positive cells were washed once, and cells (107 cells/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing fluo3/AM in a final concentration of 4 μm and 0.15 mg/ml Pluronic F-127. The cells were then diluted 1:5 in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. Afterward, the cells were washed three times and resuspended in 500 μlofCa2+-free HEPES-buffered saline, containing 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4,5mm glucose, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Prior to each measurement, the cells were incubated for 7 min in a 37 °C water bath. In some experiments the cells were pretreated for 4 min with SR144528 (1 μm). The cells were subsequently stimulated with drugs and vehicle controls and analyzed with the FL1 channel on a FACScan flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm argon laser (BD Biosciences). Because the solvent (ethanol) showed an effect on [Ca2+]i in vehicle controls, this solvent effect was subtracted from each value. Quantification of Cytokines with CBAs—Cytokine production in human peripheral whole blood was analyzed in blood plasma or supernatants of cells cultured for 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 using Cytometric Bead Arrays™ (BD Biosciences). Blood cultures were carried out as described above. IL-12p70, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 were detected using the human inflammation CBA kit (551811; BD Biosciences), and for GM-CSF, IL-7, IL-5, IL-4, and IL-3 detection the human allergy CBA kit (558022; BD Biosciences) was used. Tests were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50 μl of supernatants were mixed with 50 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated cytokine capture beads. For each set of experiments a standard curve was generated. Prior to each measurement the red and orange channels were adequately compensated, according to instructions. FL-2 was typically compensated for 40% FL-1. After3hof incubation, samples were rinsed, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan and FACSCanto) with the CBA Analysis Software; BD Biosciences). The results were expressed as pg/ml and then analyzed for their relative expression (control versus treated sample). The lower limit of detection for each cytokine was determined as 20 pg/ml. Drugs and Antibodies—Dodeca-2E,4E-dienoic acid isobutylamide (A2) was isolated from E. purpurea as published previously (31Bauer R. Reminger P. Wagner H. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 2339-2342Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) for E. angustifolia root material.

Compounds were checked for identity and integrity by thin layer chromatography and 1H NMR (500 MHz Bruker) spectroscopy prior to use. Anandamide, 2-AG, AM630, and CP-55,940 were obtained from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (UK). SR144528 was obtained as a gift from Sanofi-Synthélabo Recherche (France). Fluo3/AM, Pluronic F-127, and the monoclonal anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody were purchased from Sigma. CB2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (3561) was obtained from Abcam (UK) and was tested for differential binding to immune cells. The radioligand [3H]CP-55,940 was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Anandamide, LPS (E. coli, serotype 055:B5), and PMA (from Euphorbiaceae) were obtained from Fluka Chemie, Switzerland. Thapsigargin was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals, Switzerland.

We show here that central nervous system–specific deletion of the essential adherens junction gene, α E-catenin, causes abnormal activation of the hedgehog pathway, resulting in shortening of the cell cycle, decreased apoptosis, and cortical hyperplasia. We propose that αE-catenin connects cell-density–dependent adherens junctions with the developmental hedgehog pathway and that this connection may provide a negative feedback loop controlling the size of developing cerebral cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2157268589,"Rapid evolution of asexual populations, such as that of cancer cells or of microorganisms developing drug resistance, can include the simultaneous spread of distinct beneficial mutations. We demonstrate that evolution in such cases is driven by the fitness effects and appearance times of only a small minority of favorable mutations. The complexity of the mutation-selection process is thereby greatly reduced, and much of the evolutionary dynamics can be encapsulated in two parameters-an effective selection coefficient and effective rate of beneficial mutations. We confirm this theoretical finding and estimate the effective parameters for evolving populations of fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli. The effective parameters constitute a simple description and provide a natural standard for comparing adaptation between species and across environments."

Whether these mechanisms shared across vertebrates are the result of convergence toward an adaptive solution or evolutionary relicts reflecting common ancestral traits is unknown. Here we show that state-dependent valuation also occurs in an invertebrate, the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria (Orthoptera: Acrididae). Given the latter's phylogenetic and neurobiological distance from those groups in which the phenomenon was already known, we suggest that state-dependent valuation mechanisms are probably ecologically rational solutions to widespread problems of choice."

https://openalex.org/W2062415505,"Secondary bile acids have long been postulated to be tumor promoters in the colon; however, their mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we examined the actions of bile acids at the cell membrane and found that they can perturb membrane structure by alteration of membrane microdomains. Depletion of membrane cholesterol by treating with methyl-β-cyclodextrin suppressed deoxycholic acid (DCA)-induced apoptosis, and staining for cholesterol with filipin showed that DCA caused a marked rearrangement of this lipid in the membrane. Likewise, DCA was found to affect membrane distribution of caveolin-1, a marker protein that is enriched in caveolae membrane microdomains. Additionally, fluorescence anisotropy revealed that DCA causes a decrease in membrane fluidity consistent with the increase in membrane cholesterol content observed after 4 h of DCA treatment of HCT116 cells. Significantly, by using radiolabeled bile acids, we found that bile acids are able to interact with and localize to microdomains differently depending on their physicochemical properties. DCA was also found to induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activate the receptor tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor in a ligand-independent manner. In contrast, ursodeoxycholic acid did not exhibit any of these effects even though it interacted significantly with the microdomains. Collectively, these data suggest that bile acid-induced signaling is initiated through alterations of the plasma membrane structure and the redistribution of cholesterol.

Collectively, these data suggest that bile acid-induced signaling is initiated through alterations of the plasma membrane structure and the redistribution of cholesterol. Bile acids are hydrophobic derivatives of cholesterol that play an important role in digestion and absorption of fats. They are synthesized in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and excreted into the intestine as conjugated bile acids covalently linked to glycine and taurine. Bile acids serve many important physiological functions, including cholesterol homeostasis, lipid absorption, and generation of bile flow, that help in the excretion and recirculation of drugs, vitamins, and endogenous and exogenous toxins (1Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Typically, after secretion into the intestines, bile acids are efficiently reabsorbed through enterohepatic circulation, although a small percentage (∼4%) is known to escape into the colon (2Carey M.C. Duane W.C. Enterohepatic Circulation, 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 719-767Google Scholar, 3Hoffman A.F. Bile Acids, 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 677-718Google Scholar). There, the primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA), 2The abbreviations used are: CA, cholic acid; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; DCA, deoxycholic acid; UDCA, ursodeoxycholic acid; EGF, epidermal growth factor; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; EGFR, EGF receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TMA-DPH, trimethylamonium-diphenylhexatriene; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), may be deconjugated and dehydroxylated by intestinal bacteria to form secondary bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). More importantly, secondary bile acids such as DCA have been postulated to be tumor promoters in the colon (4Reddy B.S. Watanabe K. Weisburger J.H. Wynder E.L. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 3238-3242PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, in vitro studies have revealed the cytotoxic effects of secondary bile acids on the colon further implicating them in tumorigenicity (5van Munster I.P. Tangerman A. de Haan A.F. Nagengast F.M. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 23: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Animal studies have shown that DCA can induce loss of colonic epithelium and a subsequent proliferative response (6Cohen B.I. Raicht R.F. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 3759-3760PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown a dose-dependent effect of bile acids and the incidence of tumors, all of which support a causal link of bile acids to cancer occurrence (7Narisawa T. Reddy B.S. Weisburger J.H. Gastroenterol. Jpn. 1978; 13: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Morvay K. Szentleleki K. Torok G. Pinter A. Borzsonyi M. Nawroth R. Dis. Colon Rectum. 1989; 32: 860-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, epidemiological studies have confirmed that consumption of a high fat/low fiber diet leads to elevated fecal concentrations of secondary bile acids and is associated with an increased incidence of colorectal cancer (9Armstrong B. Doll R. Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 15: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar, 10Rogers A.E. Newberne P.M. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 3427-3431PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with colorectal cancer have higher levels of bile acids in the colonic lumen further supporting a role for bile acids as tumor-promoting agents (11Bayerdorffer E. Mannes G.A. Ochsenkuhn T. Dirschedl P. Wiebecke B. Paumgartner G. Gut. 1995; 36: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Korpela J.T. Adlercreutz H. Turunen M.J. Scand. J.

In the liver, numerous studies have revealed that bile acids are signaling molecules that activate nuclear receptors and regulate many physiological pathways and processes to maintain bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis. Analyses of orphan receptors expression patterns in enterohepatic tissues have identified bile acids as ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (14Rizzo G. Renga B. Mencarelli A. Pellicciari R. Fiorucci S. Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 2005; 5: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Particularly, the primary bile acids CDCA and to a lesser extent the secondary bile acids lithocholic acid and DCA have all been shown to be potent activators of farnesoid X receptor (15Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar, 16Xu G. Pan L.X. Li H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50491-50496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies by Stratvitz et al. (17Stravitz R.T. Rao Y.P. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gurley E.C. Jarvis W.D. Hylemon P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G293-G303PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that bile acids can transactivate protein kinase C in hepatocytes and repress the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme CYP7A1. In addition, animal studies have also demonstrated a role for bile acids in the activation of inflammatory cytokines and the MAPK signaling pathways involving nuclear receptors such as HNF-4 (18De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that hydrophobic bile acids such as DCA are able to activate signaling cascades in colon cancer cells (19Qiao D. Chen W. Stratagoules E.D. Martinez J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15090-15098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We showed that bile acids can stimulate intracellular signaling cascades, including those mediated by protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), two important signal transducers that activate intracellular signals that control cell growth and are involved in tumorigenesis (19Qiao D. Chen W. Stratagoules E.D. Martinez J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15090-15098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Morgan W.A. Sharma P. Kaler B. Bach P.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 75SCrossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Moreover, DCA appears to suppress the mitogenic activation of the p53 tumor suppressor (21Qiao D. Gaitonde S.V. Qi W. Martinez J.D. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hence, DCA can activate mitogenic signaling and inhibit tumor suppressor activity. Studies done in our laboratory have shown a differential effect of bile acids based on their hydrophobicity. Highly hydrophobic bile acids such as DCA and CDCA are able to induce apoptosis rapidly, whereas UDCA, a less hydrophobic bile acid, is not cytotoxic and is able to inhibit proliferation in colon cancer cell lines (22Martinez J.D. Stratagoules E.D. LaRue J.M. Powell A.A. Gause P.R. Craven M.T. Payne C.M. Powell M.B. Gerner E.W. Earnest D.L. Nutr. Cancer. 1998; 31: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 23Ikegami T. Matsuzaki Y. Shoda J. Kano M. Hirabayashi N. Tanaka N. Cancer Lett. 1998; 134: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In fact, because of its hydrophilic nature UDCA has been found to inhibit DCA-induced apoptosis in rat hepatocytes through modulation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and through production of reactive oxygen species (24Rodrigues C.M. Fan G. Wong P.Y. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 165-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The above findings not only strengthen a role for bile acids in signaling but also reveal a distinct mechanism of action of bile acids based on their physicochemical properties. An essential constituent of plasma membranes is cholesterol, which rigidifies the membrane and is an important structural component of membrane microdomains (25Luciano L. Konitz H. Reale E. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Due to the fact that bile acids are cholesterol derivatives with detergent properties, it has been speculated that bile acids may alter the stability of the membrane lipid bilayer (26Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49631-49637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In fact, it is hypothesized that bile acids with increased hydrophobicity have a greater capacity to perturb the structure of, or partly digest, cell membranes (27Sagawa H. Tazuma S. Kajiyama G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G835-G839PubMed Google Scholar, 28Vyvoda O.S. Coleman R. Holdsworth G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 465: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Coleman R. Iqbal S. Godfrey P.P. Billington D. Biochem. J. 1979; 178: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover, cholesterol has been shown to play an important role in the functioning of receptor-mediated signaling (30Pike L.J. Casey L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10315-10322Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and cholesterol has also been shown to play a critical role in organizing membrane microdomains, such as rafts and caveolae through binding of caveolin proteins (31Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8188) Google Scholar, 32Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). Because bile acids are cholesterol derivatives and cholesterol is enriched in microdomains and able to modulate receptor activity in rafts and caveolae, we decided to investigate the effects of bile acids on the membrane. We found that hydrophobic bile acids have a marked effect on membrane structure and activation of intracellular signaling. The role that these activities may have in bile acid-mediated tumorigenesis is discussed. DCA, CA, and CDCA were obtained from Sigma, and UDCA was obtained from Calbiochem.

The human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines HCT116 and the epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 were purchased from the American Tissue Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were maintained in bulk culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 100 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μm nonessential amino acids, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 mg of streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C and passaged using 0.25% EDTA/trypsin. Detection of Phosphotyrosine-activated Proteins—HCT116 cells were grown in 10-cm culture dishes in FBS supplemented DMEM to 90% confluence. Twelve hours prior to the study, the medium was replaced by serum-free DMEM. Then cells were treated with bile acids at 500 μm. Control cells (kept in serum-free media) and bile acid-treated cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaVo4). Forty microliters of SDS loading buffer (4% SDS, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) were then added to 100-μg samples, boiled for 5 min, loaded onto a 7.5% or other SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to electrophoresis at 60 V for 16 h. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 3 h. The membranes were then blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with Tween) and then incubated overnight with the primary antibody at 4 °C. Proteins were visualized by ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Kodak film. Apoptosis Assay—Apoptosis was ascertained microscopically using ethidium bromide and acridine orange as described previously (33Powell A.A. LaRue J.M. Batta A.K. Martinez J.D. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 30-mm plates at 1 × 105 cells for 24 h until they reached confluency. They were then treated with various bile acids, genistein, or methyl-β-cyclodextrin for the times indicated. Both the floating and adherent cells were collected and centrifuged. They were then washed in PBS, pH 7.0, and resuspended in 1 ml of DMEM. To detect apoptosis, 10 μl of cells were mixed with ethidium bromide and acridine orange solution (100 μg/ml each in DMEM) and visualized for morphological changes. Acridine orange stains the nuclei green in viable cells, and the propidium iodide is excluded. However, in apoptotic or necrotic cells, the nuclei are stained red by the propidium iodide, and the morphology of the nucleus easily determines whether the cell is apoptotic or necrotic. A minimum of 200 cells was counted and the percentage of apoptotic cells determined. All experiments were performed in triplicate. In Vitro Toxicology Viability Assay, MTT-based—Cell viability was measured by using an in vitro toxicology assay kit from Sigma. HCT116 cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells and allowed to grow for 24 h in 6-well plates until they reached confluency. Cells were then incubated in serum-free media containing 500 μm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 12 h. They were then washed three times in PBS and re-incubated in phenol red-free media along with reconstituted MTT in an amount equal to 10% of the culture medium volume. Cells were then returned to a 37 °C incubator for 3 h. After the incubation period, the resulting formazan crystals were dissolved in an MTT solubilization solution in an amount equal to the original culture medium volume. To ensure complete dissolution of formazan crystals, the solution was gently pipetted up and down, and the absorbance was then read using a Max 200 microplate spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 570 nm. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Filipin Staining and/or Co-localization with Caveolin-1—HCT116 cells seeded on coverslips were rinsed briefly three times in PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in H2O for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times, quenched with 1.5 mg/ml glycine in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and subsequently stained with 0.05 mg/ml filipin in PBS for 30 min. The cells were again washed three times with PBS and mounted with coverslips in 90% glycerol/PBS. The slides were then viewed on a fluorescent microscope using a 40× objective and a 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter (340-380 nm excitation). For the localization of caveolin-1, HCT116 cells were seeded and fixed as described above. The cells were then rehydrated with PBS for 5 min before the addition of caveolin-1. Cells were then placed in a 32 °C incubator for 1 h and subsequently washed three times with PBS. An Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody was then added to the cells for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with PBS, mounted with a slow anti-fading agent kit, and observed using a Nikon PCM2000 confocal microscope and a 60×, 1.4NA Plan Apo objective using a Green-He/Ne laser (633 nm). Labeling of Live Cells with Fluorescent Bile Acids and/or Caveolin-1—HCT116 cells seeded on coverslips were incubated overnight in serum-free media or in serum-free media containing 500 μm methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 500 μm fluorescent DCA in serum-free media for various times. Next, coverslips were washed three times in PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in H2O for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were again washed three times in PBS and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium. For the co-localization of fluorescent bile acids and caveolin-1, cells were treated with salt DCA and UDCA for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times in PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated with caveolin-1 in a 32 °C incubator for 1 h and later washed three times with PBS. An Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody was then added to the cells for 30 min along with 500 μm fluorescent DCA. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with PBS, mounted with a slow anti-fading agent kit, and observed using a 40× objective lens on a Nikon confocal microscope with an argon filter (590-617 nm excitation). Particle percentage analysis was performed using the Image J program from the National Institutes of Health. Membrane Fluidity Measurements—HCT116 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate in supplemented DMEM, grown to subconfluence, and then transferred to serum-free media (0.2% FBS) for 12 h. One hour prior to experiment, cells were treated with various bile acids, and membrane fluidity was estimated. Two fluorescent probes were used as follows: diphenylhexatriene (1 μm) and its cationic derivative the trimethylammonium diphenylhexatriene (TMA-DPH, 1 μm). Their stock solutions were prepared and dissolved in organic solvents as follows: 1 mm DPH and 0.5 mm TMA-DPH in N,N-dimethylformamide. Cells were washed three times in PBS at 25 °C, gently pipetted off the plates, and resuspended at a concentration of 106 cells/ml in PBS along with the probes for a minimum of 30 min with DPH and 5 min with TMA-DPH. Fluorescence anisotropy 〈r 〉 was assessed according to Shinitzky and Barenholz (34Shinitzky M. Barenholz Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2652-2657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the following equation: 〈r 〉= (I0 - I90)/(I0 + 2I90), where I0 and I90 are the intensities of the emitted light, the polarization plane of which is oriented parallel and perpendicular to the polarization plane of the excitation beam, respectively. Fluorescence anisotropy was later determined using an 8500 Spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments Inc., Rochester, NY) equipped with polarization measurement accessories. Synthesis of Fluorescently Tagged Cholic Acids—The synthesis of fluorescently tagged deoxycholic acid derivative 2 followed the procedure described by Mills et al. (35Mills C.O. Rahman K. Coleman R. Elias E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1115: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Mills C.O. Milkiewicz P. Molloy D.P. Baxter D.J. Elias E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) for the synthesis of cholyllysylfluorescein 1. Deoxycholic acid was coupled with Nϵ-benzyloxycarbonyl lysine methyl ester using N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline to give a product in 98% yield. Saponification of the methyl ester gave a new product in 62% yield, and removal of the benzyloxycarbonyl group via hydrogenolysis gave deoxycholyllysyl formate in 98% yield. Conversion to the sodium carboxylate salt was followed by reaction with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) in aqueous sodium bicarbonate buffered to pH 9.5. Following purification by reverse phase column chromatography (37-53 μm C-18 silica eluted with MeOH/H2O. 1:1), the desired compound 2 (Scheme 1) was obtained in 35% yield. The corresponding fluorescently tagged ursodeoxycholic acid derivative 3 (37Milkiewicz P.M. Roma M.G. Ahmed-Choudhury J. Coleman R. Elias E. Proceedings of the Falk Workshop. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1999: 1-368Google Scholar) was prepared in a similar fashion (complete synthesis scheme available upon request). Purification of Caveolin-enriched Membrane Fractions—Total cell membranes were isolated by the method of Song et al. (38Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, HCT116 cells were homogenized in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The nuclei and cell debris were removed from the homogenate by centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting lysate was then sonicated, adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of sodium carbonate and 2 ml of 90% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5; 0.15 m NaCl), and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5-35% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (4 ml of 5% sucrose, 4 ml of 35% sucrose, both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16-20 h in an SW40 Ti rotor. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and/or used in cholesterol analysis. In addition, whole cell lysate of A431 cells was also prepared by a nondetergent purification method in order to obtain a more purified raft fraction (38Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Cholesterol/Cholestenone Extraction and Detection—To measure the increase in cell surface cholesterol, HCT116 cells were grown to 85-90% confluency and treated with DCA for the indicated times. Cells were washed with PBS, harvested by scraping, and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min. Cells were again washed and subjected to 4 units of cholesterol oxidase in PBS at 25 °C for 30 min. Cells were then lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, and total lipids were extracted according to the Bligh and Dyer method (39Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43406) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 375 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2) followed by 30 s of vortexing. Subsequently, 125 μl of chloroform and 125 μl of 1 m NaCl were added while mixing. The contents were then centrifuged to separate the organic phase from the aqueous phase. The organic fraction was then collected and evaporated in a speed vacuum centrifuge. The dried extracts were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1) and were subsequently applied to an LK5D Silica Gel 150A TLC plate (Whatman). The samples along with cholesterol and cholestenone standards were separated on TLC plates using chloroform/methanol (100:2) as running solvent. The detection and densitometry were carried out as described by Herget et al. (40Herget T. Esdar C. Oehrlein S.A. Heinrich M. Schutze S. Maelicke A. van Echten-Deckert G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30344-30354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dried plates were exposed to a solution containing 10% cupric acid and 8% phosphoric acid, and the plates were charred at 150 °C for 10 min until the cholesterol and cholestenone bands were visible. The plates were then scanned, and densitometry was carried out. The density values were normalized per microgram of protein for plotting graphs. Detection of Ceramide and Sphingomyelin—To detect cellular changes in sphingomyelin and ceramide, HCT116 cells were treated with DCA for the indicated times and harvested as described above. The cells were lysed in 0.5 Triton X-100, and total lipids were extracted according to a modified Bligh and Dyer method (41Liu P. Wang P. Michaely P. Zhu M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31648-31654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Again, 100 μl of cell lysate was added to 120 μl of chloroform and 120 μl of methanol (mixed with 2% acetic acid) and vortexed three times for 10 s. The subsequent steps were essentially similar to the method described above except that the phosphatidylcholine, ceramide (C-16 and C-18), and sphingomyelin markers were run on an LK5D Silica Gel 150A TLC plate with the samples, while the phospholipids were resolved in a solvent system containing chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1, v/v). The dried plates were then exposed to a solution containing 10% cupric acid and 8% phosphoric acid, and the plates were charred at 150 °C for 10 min until the sphingomyelin, ceramide, and phosphatidylcholine bands were visible. The plates were then scanned, and densitometry was carried out. The density values were normalized per microgram of protein for plotting graphs. Detection of [3H]DCA and [3H]UDCA in Raft Microdomains— HCT116 cells were seeded at 1.0 × 106 cells in a 60-mm plates until 80% confluency was reached. Cells were then incubated overnight in serum-free media and treated with [3H]DCA or [3H]UDCA for 1 h in a 37°C incubator. Cells were then washed twice with serum-free media. For the localization of radiolabeled bile acids, cells were left untreated, and [3H]DCA and [3H]UDCA were added to serum-free media at a concentration of 24 and 32 μm, respectively. Cells were then placed on ice for 30 min and washed twice in PBS, and a non"

Disrupting this interaction reduces ERK activity, forcing cancer cells into dormancy. We identified a site in uPAR domain III that is indispensable for these effects. A 9-mer peptide derived from a sequence in domain III (residues 240-248) binds purified α5β1 integrin. Substituting a single amino acid (S245A) in this peptide, or in full-length soluble uPAR, impairs binding of the purified integrin. In the recently solved crystal structure of uPAR the Ser-245 is confined to the large external surface of the receptor, a location that is well separated from the central urokinase plasminogen binding cavity. The impact of this site on α5β1 integrin-dependent cell functions was examined by comparing cells induced to express uPARwt or the uPARS245A mutant. Transfecting uPARwt into cells with low endogenous levels of uPAR, inactive integrin, low ERK activity, and a dormant phenotype in vivo restores these functions and reinstates growth in vivo. In contrast, transfection of the same cells with uPARS245A elicits only very small changes. Incubation of highly malignant cells with the wild-type, but not the S245A mutant peptide, disrupts the uPAR integrin interaction leading to down-regulation of ERK activity. The relevance of this binding site, and of the lateral uPAR-α5β1 integrin interaction, to ERK pathway activation and tumor growth implicates it as a possible specific target for cancer therapy.

In a large proportion of patients that undergo surgical removal of primary cancer and who, at the time of surgery, show no detectable disseminated disease, the cancer recurs, sometimes more than decades later. This means that small numbers of cancer cells, undetected by currently available techniques, can persist in a dormant state. The mechanisms that allow them to remain dormant and alive, as well as those causing them to initiate proliferation and form overt metastases, are largely unknown. We previously reported on a model of human head and neck carcinoma, which retained its partial dependence on extracellular matrix for proliferative signals in vivo (1Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Liu D. Mignatti A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 863-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 2Aguirre Ghiso J.A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. J.

These cells express very high levels of both the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) 4The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; uPAR, uPA receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; DOC, deoxycholate; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FN, fibronectin; CAM, chorioallantoic membrane; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEp3, human epidermoid carcinoma 3; HEK, human embryonic kidney; suPAR, soluble recombinant uPAR; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; NHS, N′-hydroxysuccinimide. and its receptor (uPAR), which cause the activation of the α5β1 integrin, and by recruiting epidermal growth factor receptor, initiate a signaling cascade that leads to persistently high level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and tumorigenicity (3Liu D. Aguirre Ghiso J. Estrada Y. Ossowski L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We have shown that reduction of uPAR levels through stable uPAR-antisense expression forces cells into a state of prolonged dormancy (1Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Liu D. Mignatti A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 863-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 4Yu W. Kim J. Ossowski L. J.

Zelent A. Ossowski L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3983-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although uPAR is linked through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor to the surface of cells (7Ploug M. Ronne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been shown to possess signaling properties (8Blasi F.

Because uPAR has no cytoplasmic domain, it became obvious that it must be signaling by partnering with other “competent” receptors. Several such proteins, belonging to different families, such as internalization receptors (low density receptor-related protein and uPAR associated protein, also called uPARAP/Endo 180) (11Behrendt N.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1787-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have been identified. Among the interacting partners, integrins belonging to at least three families, β1, β2, and β3 (2Aguirre Ghiso J.A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. J.

These latter interactions have been shown to alter a variety of functions, including phagocytosis, adhesion, migration, protease secretion (8Blasi F. Carmeliet P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 932-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 9Ossowski L. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 10Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and, of specific relevance to the current work, proliferation. Until recently, the uPAR and integrin interactions have been gleaned from co-immunoprecipitation experiments, fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, and co-localization by immunocytochemistry. The integrin (αVβ3) structure has been solved recently (17Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), facilitating the mapping of the interaction sites with uPAR on both the α and β subunits of several integrins (18Zhang F.

Equivalently reliable data for the site on uPAR involved in integrin interaction were missing, in part because until very recently (21Llinas P. Le Du M.H. Gardsvoll H. Dano K. Ploug M. Gilquin B. Stura E.A. Menez A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Huai Q. Mazar A.P. Kuo A. Parry G.C. Shaw D.E. Callahan J. Li Y. Yuan C. Bian C. Chen L. Furie B. Furie B.C. Cines D.B. Huang M. Science. 2006; 311: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) the structure of uPAR has not been solved. We have previously shown that treatment of cancer cells with a monoclonal antibody (R2), directed to an epitope located in domain III of uPAR, blocked activation of α5β1 integrin by uPAR and strongly reduced signaling to ERK (5Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Estrada Y. Liu D. Ossowski L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1684-1695PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested domain III as a plausible site for interaction with integrin. Because uPAR is overexpressed in many malignant tumors (23Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar, 24Sidenius N. Blasi F. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and because we showed that the activating event between uPAR and integrin occurs only in cancer cells that express high uPAR levels, we consider this interaction to predominate in cancer and thus to constitute a potentially unique target for cancer therapy. We further argued that a successful intervention to disrupt this interaction might induce tumor dormancy. In this report we describe a series of experiments that include a test of binding interactions between purified α5β1 integrin and short synthetic uPAR-derived peptides, as well as full-length suPAR, with individual amino acids substitutions. These experiments allowed us to identify a sequence within domain III of uPAR that is crucial for interaction with the integrin. Substituting one of these residues (Ser-245) with alanine impaired the ability of uPAR to enter into functional interactions with the integrin, inhibiting signaling and growth in vivo.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Synthetic, non-uPA binding peptides (26Liang O.D. Bdeir K. Matz R.L. Chavakis T. Preissner K.T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) derived from the uPAR sequences were purchased from Biotrend (Köln, Germany) or from Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (San Francisco, CA) either biotinylated on N termini or with unmodified termini and free thiolgroups in cysteines. Purified soluble uPARwt (residues 1-283) and single amino acid mutants were prepared as previously described (27Gardsvoll H. Dano K. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37995-38003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Most uPAR mutants were produced in Drosophila Schneider cells, with the exception of E33A and Q248A, which were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Recombinant proteins expressed in both cell types are glycosylated on the same residues, but the proteins produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells have a more complex glycosylation pattern (28Gardsvoll H. Werner F. Sondergaard L. Dano K. Ploug M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 34: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Ploug M. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Nielsen P.F. Roepstorff P. Dano K. J. Biol.

FN-depleted serum was prepared on a gelatin-Sepharose4B column as per the manufacturer's instruction, and plasminogen-depleted serum was prepared by passing FBS twice through a lysine-Sepharose column. Solid-phase Dot-ELISA—Synthetic uPAR-derived peptides and mutant proteins were diluted to 0.5, 1, and 2 μg/100 μl of PBS. The samples were dot-blotted using a Bio-Rad Dot-ELISA apparatus onto a pre-wet nitrocellulose (0.2 μm) membrane in duplicates under a low vacuum, blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h on a gently shaking platform, cut into strips that were placed on a Saran-wrapped ELISA plate, overlaid with 500 μl of purified human α5β1 integrin (750 ng/ml of PBS), and incubated for 90 min in a humidified chamber at room temperature. The strips, pinned to the bottom of a plastic box, were washed with TBS (with 0.1% Tween 20), overlaid with 500 μl of rabbit anti integrin α5 polyclonal antibody (1:650) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with TBST twice, incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h, washed three times with TBST, and developed with ECL. The dots were scanned with Image (National Institutes of Health (NIH)). Kinetics of Pro-uPA-uPAR Interaction Determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance—The interactions between immobilized pro-uPA (200-1000 relative units) and purified uPAR, produced in S2-cells (29Ploug M. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Nielsen P.F. Roepstorff P. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13933-13943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), were measured at 20 °C by a Biacore3000 using serial 2-fold dilutions ranging from 1 to 100 nm uPAR. Coupling of pro-uPAS356A to the sensor chip by N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethyl carbodiimide/NHS and regeneration of the chip are performed essentially as previously described (28Gardsvoll H. Werner F. Sondergaard L. Dano K. Ploug M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 34: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The rate constants kon and koff were derived from these data by nonlinear least squares curve fitting using BIAevaluation 4.1 software. Cell Lines—Tumorigenic human epidermoid carcinoma HEp3 (T-HEp3) cells were serially passaged on chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) of chick embryos as described previously (30Ossowski L. Reich E. Cell. 1983; 35: 611-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). To obtain dormant HEp3 (D-HEp3) cells, the T-HEp3 cells were passaged in culture for 120-170 passages as described (30Ossowski L. Reich E. Cell. 1983; 35: 611-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). D-HEp3 cells express ∼20% of uPAR found in T-HEp3 cells (2Aguirre Ghiso J.A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin (500 units/ml), and streptomycin (200 μg/ml). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Transfection—A construct expressing full-length uPAR-cDNA in HindIII site of pcDNA3.1-Hyg from Invitrogen was as described (3Liu D. Aguirre Ghiso J. Estrada Y. Ossowski L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis (Ser-245 to alanine substitution in domain III of uPAR) was carried out according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) using pcDNA3.1-uPAR as template and the following two primers: 5′-GCTGTGCAACCGCCTCAATGTGCCAACATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATGTTGGCACATTGCGGCGGTTGAACAGC-3′ (reverse). The mutation was validated by DNA sequencing using oligonucleotides 5′-GAGACTTTCCTCATTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATGAGGAAAGTCTC-3′ (reverse) for sequencing. D-HEp3 and HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3.1), or uPARwt, or uPARS245A, using FuGENE reagent (3 μl FuGENE/μg of DNA). Surface Biotinylation with Sulfo-NHS-Biotin and Cell Lysis—48 h after transfection, subconfluent monolayers were washed three times with cold PBS, incubated with 5 ml of 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin from Pierce on ice for 20 min, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped into 1 ml of pre-chilled PBS containing mixture of protease inhibitors, and briefly spun at 4 °C. The pellets were lysed for 30 min on ice in integrin lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2., 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride) containing a mixture of proteinase inhibitors, the cell lysates were spun down at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and biotinylated protein detection. Co-immunoprecipitation of α5β1 Integrin and uPAR—Cell lysates (0.8 mg of protein) were pre-cleared with protein G-agarose beads preincubated with isotype-matched IgG for 45 min at 4 °C on a rolling platform, and the supernatants were incubated for 3 h at 4°C with protein G-agarose beads to which 5 μg of anti-α5β1(HA5), R3 antibodies, or isotype-matched IgG was bound. The protein G-beads were washed twice with PBS and protease inhibitors and once with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, heated, separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, probed either with rabbit anti-uPAR polyclonal antibody or streptavidin-HRP, washed, and developed using ECL and scanned with NIH Image. To disrupt the preformed α5β1 integrin-uPAR complex, the pre-cleared cell lysates were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with either the 240-248 or the mutant S245A peptides (5 and 20 μm), followed by pull-down with anti-α5β1(HA5) antibody. The rest of the procedures were as in co-immunoprecipitation. Detection of ERKMAPK Activity and the Effect of Peptides—To analyze ERK activity, D-HEp3 and HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1, uPARwt, and uPARS245A and, 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1%SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl) for 30 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-P-ERK and anti-ERK antibodies. The level of uPAR expression was also tested in the same lysates by Western blotting using R2 antibody. The bands produced by anti-P-ERK and ERK antibodies were scanned by NIH Image, and the ratios of P-ERK to ERK were calculated. To test the effect of uPAR integrin-inhibiting peptides on ERK activity, T-HEp3 cells transfected with two plasmids that report through GFP level on the state of ERK activation and designated T-ELK (5Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Estrada Y. Liu D. Ossowski L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1684-1695PubMed Google Scholar) were plated in 48-well plates, serum-starved overnight, and treated, in duplicates, with 5 and 25 μm uPAR-derived synthetic peptides (240-248) or 25 μm (17Xiong J.P.

Untreated cells served as positive control, and cells not expressing GFP as negative control. The cells were detached and analyzed for GFP by FACS analysis using FACS Canto (BD Biosciences) and FACSDiva software. Alternatively, T-HEp3 cells, serum-starved overnight were incubated in serum-free medium with 5, 20, and 40 μm uPAR-derived synthetic peptide 240-248, 17-24, or S245A for 1 h or with 25 μm peptide 240-248 and 17-24 for 10 min, 45 min, and 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and processed as described above. Concentration dependence of P-ERK inhibition was analyzed by scanning P-ERK and ERK bands with NIH Image and expressing their ratios as the percentage of the ratio in untreated control (T-HEp3) cells. Adhesion Assay—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1, uPARwt, or uPARS245A. After 40 h the cells were detached with 4 mm EDTA, suspended in DMEM, and inoculated (1.5 × 104 per well) in a 48-well plate, pre-coated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg/ml fibronectin, and blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. Following 15- and 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with PBS with CaCl2 and MgCl2, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, stained with 1% crystal violet for 10 min, washed, dried, and destained with 10% methanol and 5% acetic acid. Then the optical density of the extracted dye was measured in triplicate using an ELISA microplate reader, ELX800 from Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc. (Shelton, CT) at 570 nm. To analyze the uPA-induced adhesion to fibronectin, uPARwt- and uPARS245A-transfected HEK293 cells were incubated prior to adhesion assay in suspension in DMEM with pro-uPA (10 nm), either in the presence or absence of anti-uPAR antibody R2 (10 μg/ml) for 10 min, washed with DMEM, and plated as above. To test the effect of peptides on adhesion to FN, T-HEp3 and HEK293 cells (the latter transiently transfected with uPARwt) were incubated with DMEM with RGD or RAD peptide (500 μm, as a positive and negative control of the assay) or 240-248 or 17-24 peptide (20 and 200 μm) for 15 min at room temperature, and plated as above. Detection of Active-β1 Integrin by FACS Analysis—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1, uPARwt, and uPARS245. After 48 h the cells were detached with 2 mm EDTA in PBS and resuspended in RPMI and aprotinin (20 μg/ml) at 5 × 105 cells/100 μl. Vector-transfected cells were incubated with, or without, MnCl2 followed by HUTS-4 antibody (1.0 μg). uPARwt- and uPARS245A-transfected cells were incubated with HUTS-4 (1.0 μg) or isotype-matched IgG2b, or R2 (2.0 μg), or isotype-matched IgG1, at 37 °C for 20 min, washed, and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse Alexa 488-coupled IgG (1:400) at 4 °C for 25 min. Finally, cells were washed and suspended in 400 μl of FACS buffer and analyzed in FACS Canto using FACSDiva software. Cells incubated with the isotype-matched Ig were used to gate the HUTS-4 and R2, respectively. Detection of Cell-associated Fibronectin by Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with uPARwt and uPARS245A and plated on coverslips 5 h after transfection. After 24 h in serum-containing medium, the medium was replaced with medium with 10% FN-depleted serum supplemented with human FN (30 μg/ml) with or without 20 μg/ml α5β1-blocking antibody (BIIG2). In another set, pro-uPA (15 nm) was added to medium with FBS from which plasminogen was removed and human FN (30 μg/ml) was added. 48 h after transfection the cells were stained with rabbit anti-human FN antibody (Sigma) followed by goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to Alexa 488, and the nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The images were observed in a fluorescence Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and photographed with a SPOT-RT™ camera (Spot Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Deoxycholate-insoluble FN—Cells were prepared as in Fig. 3B except that they were not passaged onto coverslips and nor treated with anti-α5β1 antibody. The methods used to extract FN were as previously described (1Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Liu D. Mignatti A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 863-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), except that no β-mercaptoethanol was added to the sample buffer. Growth of uPARwt- and uPARS245A-transfected D-HEp3 Cells in Vivo (CAM)—Semi-confluent D-HEp3 cells were transfected with vector alone or with uPARwt or uPARS245A mutant-expressing plasmids, and 36 h later the cells were detached with EDTA, counted and inoculated at 7 × 105 cells per CAM on 4 eggs each, as previously described (1Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Liu D. Mignatti A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 863-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). One dish of each transfectant was lysed and used to determine uPAR expression by Western blotting using R2 antibody. Four days after inoculation the CAMs were excised and dissociated into single cells with collagenase (1Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Liu D. Mignatti A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 863-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and the tumor cells, which are larger than the chick embryo cells, were counted. We previously established that only 50% of the cells are recovered from the CAM 24 h after inoculation. Statistics—Paired t test was used for statistical analysis of data in Fig. 4 (adhesion) and Fig. 6 (growth on CAM).FIGURE 6ERK activation and growth in vivo. A, transfected uPARwt produces stronger activation of ERK than uPARS245A (top and middle panels); HEK293 and D-HEp3 cells, transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector, or with an expression construct for uPARwt or uPARS245A were lysed 48 h later and analyzed by Western blotting for phospho-ERK (top panels) and ERK1, -2 (middle panels) with specific antibodies. The bands were scanned with NIH Image. The ratio of phospho-ERK to ERK was calculated and expressed as a fraction of the ratio of pcDNA3.1transfected cells. Bottom panels, uPARwt and uPARS245A expression determined by Western blotting. HEK293 cells do not express uPAR. B, uPARS245A does not provide a proliferative stimulus in vivo. D-HEp3 cells transfected with vector, or uPARwt or uPARS245A were detached with EDTA 36 h after transfection, and 7 × 105 cells in 30 μlofPBS was inoculated onto CAM of 10-day-old chick embryos. Each sample was inoculated onto four CAMs. The CAMs were excised 4 days later, and the number of tumor cells was determined as under “Experimental Procedures.” The bars show mean ± S.D. Shown are paired t test vector/uPARS245A (p = 0.76), vector/uPARwt (p = 0.0005) and uPARS245/uPARwt (p = 0.0002). Inset: uPAR expression detected by Western blot with R2 antibody. C, peptide 240-248"
https://openalex.org/W2020772532,"The parietal-eye photoreceptor is unique because it has two antagonistic light signaling pathways in the same cell—a hyperpolarizing pathway maximally sensitive to blue light and a depolarizing pathway maximally sensitive to green light. Here, we report the molecular components of these two pathways. We found two opsins in the same cell: the blue-sensitive pinopsin and a previously unidentified green-sensitive opsin, which we name parietopsin. Signaling components included gustducin-α and Gα o , but not rod or cone transducin-α. Single-cell recordings demonstrated that G o mediates the depolarizing response. Gustducin-α resembles transducin-α functionally and likely mediates the hyperpolarizing response. The parietopsin-G o signaling pair provides clues about how rod and cone phototransduction might have evolved."
https://openalex.org/W1990754871,"In order to identify novel candidates associated with prostate cancer metastasis, we compared the proteomic profile of the poorly metastatic human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, with its highly metastatic variant LNCaP-LN3, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A major protein spot (pI of 5.9 and molecular weight of 37 kDa) was seen in LNCaP cells, but not in LNCaP-LN3 cells and was identified as lactate dehydrogenase-B (LDHB), by tandem mass spectrometry. Furthermore, enzyme kinetic assays and zymography showed a higher LDH enzyme activity in LNCaP cells compared with LNCaP-LN3. Bisulphite-modified DNA sequencing showed promoter hypermethylation in LNCaP-LN3 cells but not in LNCaP, Du145, PC3, CWR22 or BPH45 cells. Treatment of LNCaP-LN3 cells with 5′-azacytidine caused re-expression of LDHB transcripts. In tissues, LDHB promoter hypermethylation occurred at a higher frequency in prostate cancer, 14/ 31 (45%), compared to adjacent nonmalignant or benign tissue, 2/19 (11%) (P<0.025). Immunohistochemistry showed a higher frequency of LDHB expression in benign or non-malignant tissues, 59/ 73 (81%), compared to cancer cases, 3/53 (6%) (P<0.001). Absent LDHB expression was also seen in 7/7 (100%) cases of metastatic cancer in bone. Our data are the first to show loss of LDHB expression in prostate cancer, the mechanism of which appears to involve promoter hypermethylation."
https://openalex.org/W1992474575,"We determined the crystal structure of human hematopoietic prostaglandin (PG) D synthase (H-PGDS) as the quaternary complex with glutathione (GSH), Mg2+, and an inhibitor, HQL-79, having anti-inflammatory activities in vivo, at a 1.45-Ä resolution. In the quaternary complex, HQL-79 was found to reside within the catalytic cleft between Trp104 and GSH. HQL-79 was stabilized by interaction of a phenyl ring of its diphenyl group with Trp104 and by its piperidine group with GSH and Arg14 through water molecules, which form a network with hydrogen bonding and salt bridges linked to Mg2+. HQL-79 inhibited human H-PGDS competitively against the substrate PGH2 and non-competitively against GSH with Ki of 5 and 3 μm, respectively. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that HQL-79 bound to H-PGDS with an affinity that was 12-fold higher in the presence of GSH and Mg2+ (Kd, 0.8 μm) than in their absence. Mutational studies revealed that Arg14 was important for the Mg2+-mediated increase in the binding affinity of H-PGDS for HQL-79, and that Trp104, Lys112, and Lys198 were important for maintaining the HQL-binding pocket. HQL-79 selectively inhibited PGD2 production by H-PGDS-expressing human megakaryocytes and rat mastocytoma cells with an IC50 value of about 100 μm but only marginally affected the production of other prostanoids, suggesting the tight functional engagement between H-PGDS and cyclooxygenase. Orally administered HQL-79 (30 mg/kg body weight) inhibited antigen-induced production of PGD2, without affecting the production of PGE2 and PGF2α, and ameliorated airway inflammation in wild-type and human H-PGDS-overexpressing mice. Knowledge about this structure of quaternary complex is useful for understanding the inhibitory mechanism of HQL-79 and should accelerate the structure-based development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit PGD2 production specifically.

Thus, PGD2 coordinately regulates allergic reactions, especially airway inflammation, via these 2 receptors (5Spik I. Brenuchon C. Angeli V. Staumont D. Fleury S. Capron M. Trottein F. Dombrowicz D.

The former catalyzes 2 consecutive reactions, dioxygenation of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and peroxidation of PGG2 to PGH2, the latter being a common precursor of PGs and thromboxane. PGDS then catalyzes the isomerization of PGH2 to PGD2 in the presence of glutathione (GSH). Two distinct types of PGDS are known: one is lipocalin-type PGDS (L-PGDS); and the other, hematopoietic PGDS (H-PGDS, (6Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 89-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L-PGDS is localized in the central nervous system, male genital organs, and heart, and is involved in the regulation of sleep (7Pinzar E. Kanaoka Y. Inui T. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4903-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and pain (8Eguchi N. Minami T. Shirafuji N. Kanaoka Y. Tanaka T. Nagata A. Yoshida N. Urade Y. Ito S. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). On the other hand, H-PGDS is localized in mast cells, Th2 cells, microglia, necrotic muscle fibers, and apoptotic smooth muscle cells and participates in allergic and inflammatory reactions (9Kanaoka Y. Urade Y. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2003; 69: 163-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Selective inhibitors of H-PGDS are considered to be more useful to suppress allergic and inflammatory reactions than COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors, such as aspirin, indomethacin, and coxibs (10Psaty B.M. Furberg C.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 1133-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); because these COX inhibitors suppress the production of all PGs including the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory PGs (11Takeuchi K. Araki H. Umeda M. Komoike Y. Suzuki K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 1160-1165PubMed Google Scholar, 12Halter F. Tarnawski A.S. Schmassmann A. Peskar B.M. Gut. 2001; 49: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Selective inhibitors of H-PGDS may block the inflammatory signal mediated by both DP and CRTH2 receptors. Therefore, H-PGDS is a good target for anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory drugs (13Editorials Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 233Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar).We have already cloned the cDNA for human H-PGDS (14Kanaoka Y. Fujimori K. Kikuno R. Sakaguchi Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and determined its x-ray crystallographic structure (15Inoue T. Irikura D. Okazaki N. Kinugasa S. Matsumura H. Uodome N. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Miyano M. Kai Y. Urade Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a previous study (16Inoue T. Okano Y. Kado Y. Aritake K. Irikura D. Uodome N. Okazaki N. Kinugasa S. Shishitani H. Matsumura H. Kai Y. Urade Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 135: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), we determined the x-ray crystallographic structure of human H-PGDS in a complex with a prototype of the H-PGDS inhibitor, 2-(2′-benzothiazolyl)-5-styryl-3-(4′-phthalhydrazidyl) tetrazolium chloride (BSPT). However, BSPT inhibits H-PGDS only in vitro and is not effective in vivo or even in cultured cells. On the other hand, the novel orally active anti-allergic drug 4-benzhydryloxy-1-[3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-propyl]-piperidine (HQL-79) was reported a few years ago (17Matsushita N. Aritake K. Takada A. Hizue M. Hayashi K. Mitsui K. Hayashi M. Hirotsu I. Kimura Y. Tani T. Nakajima H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 78: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although HQL-79 was originally developed as an antagonist for histamine H1 receptors (H1R), a part of the anti-allergic and anti-asthmatic effects of HQL-79 was proposed to be mediated by the inhibition of PGD2 production, because HQL-79 inhibited the conversion of PGH2 to PGD2 in crude extracts of mouse spleen (18Matsushita N. Hizue M. Aritake K. Hayashi K. Takada A. Mitsui K. Hayashi M. Hirotsu I. Kimura Y. Tani T. Nakajima H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 78: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical characterization of HQL-79 as an inhibitor of either of the 2 types of PGDS has remained to be made.In the present study, we show that HQL-79 is a specific inhibitor of human H-PGDS with higher potency and biological availability than those of BSPT. Kinetic analyses revealed HQL-79 to be a competitive inhibitor against PGH2 and a non-competitive one against GSH. HQL-79 highly selectively inhibited the production of PGD2 catalyzed by H-PGDS with little effect on the production of other PGs in cultured human and rat cell lines or in the lungs of ovalbumin (OVA)-immunized mice transgenic for human H-PGDS. The lack of shunting of PGH2 to downstream prostanoids other than PGD2 after H-PGDS inhibition by HQL-79 suggests a tight functional engagement between H-PGDS and COX. Both in vivo and in vitro pharmacological and biochemical experiments indicate that HQL-79 is a promising lead compound for the development of new H-PGDS inhibitors to be used as anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory drugs. Finally we determined the x-ray crystallographic structure of human H-PGDS as a quaternary complex with HQL-79 and 2 cofactors, GSH and Mg2+, whose determination is useful for understanding the inhibitory mechanism of HQL-79 and for further drug design.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—HQL-79 was purchased from Cayman–Chemical.Animals—Human H-PGDS-overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice (FVB strain) were generated according to the method described previously (7Pinzar E. Kanaoka Y. Inui T. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4903-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), although human H-PGDS cDNA was used as the transgene instead of human L-PGDS cDNA. H1R gene knock-out (KO) mice (C57BL/6 strain) were provided by Dr. Takeshi Watanabe, RIKEN (19Inoue I. Yanai K. Kitamura D. Taniuchi I. Kobayashi T. Niimura K. Watanabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13316-13320Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).Allergic Airway Inflammation—Human H-PGDS-TG mice, H1R-KO mice, and wild-type (WT) mice (male, 8–9 weeks old) were actively sensitized by intraperitoneal injections of 10 μg of OVA (Sigma) in 0.2 ml of aluminum hydroxide gel given on days 0 and 14. On day 21, the mice were exposed to OVA (2.5% w/v in saline) for 20 min. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected 10 min after the end of the OVA exposure. PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α in the BALF were extracted, partially purified by HPLC, and quantified by EIA (Cayman Chemicals) as reported previously (7Pinzar E. Kanaoka Y. Inui T. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4903-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The total and differential cell counts of BALF were determined 48 h after the antigen challenge. The protocols used for all animal experiments in this study were approved by the Animal Research Committee of the Osaka Bioscience Institute.Expression and Purification of Recombinant H-PGDS—Human H-PGDS (15Inoue T. Irikura D. Okazaki N. Kinugasa S. Matsumura H. Uodome N. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Miyano M. Kai Y. Urade Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), rat H-PGDS, and its mutants of Y8F, R14E, W104I, K112E, C156L, or K198E were expressed and purified as described previously (20Pinzar E. Miyano M. Kanaoka Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31239-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In brief, Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the prepared plasmids. The cells were collected and disrupted by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to the GSH-Sepharose 4B column. After the column had been washed with PBS, the protein bound to the GSH-Sepharose 4B was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 containing 10 mm GSH. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method with bovine serum albumin used as a standard.Enzyme Assay—The activities of H-PGDS (15Inoue T. Irikura D. Okazaki N. Kinugasa S. Matsumura H. Uodome N. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Miyano M. Kai Y. Urade Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), L-PGDS (21Inui T. Ohkubo T. Emi M. Irikura D. Hayaishi O. Urade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2845-2852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and microsomal PGE synthase (m-PGES, (22Lazarus M. Kubata B.K. Eguchi N. Fujitani Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were measured with 40 μm [1-14C]PGH2 as substrate in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 in the presence of 2 mm GSH, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml IgG, unless otherwise stated. The activities of COX-1 and COX-2 were measured as described (23Ueda N. Yamashita R. Yamamoto S. Ishimura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with 50 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) used as substrate in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 2 μm hematin, 5 mml-tryptophan, 1 mm GSH, and 0.1 mg/ml IgG. The kinetic constants were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots prepared by using GraphFit software (version 3.0.8. for Windows, Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK).Cell Culture—Human megakaryoblastic cells (MEG-01S), human medulloblastoma cells (TE-671), and rat mastocytoma cells (RBL-2H3) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells stably transfected with human L-PGDS and COX-1 cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. M. Murakami, the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science. MEG-01S cells were induced to differentiate by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate to express H-PGDS and COX-1, as described previously (24Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Kanaoka Y. Sato T. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). MEG-01S, TE-671, and HEK-293 cells (5 × 105/well) were seeded into multiplates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. After having been cultured for 1 day, the cells were stimulated with 5 μm calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) for 15 min in the absence or presence of HQL-79 (3–300 μm). RBL-2H3 cells (2.5 × 105/well) were seeded into multiplates and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. After the sensitization of these cells with 50 ng/ml monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl IgE, the cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin or 5 μm A23187 for 15 min in the absence or presence of HQL-79 (1–100 μm). In some experiments, cells were pre-labeled with [1-14C]arachidonic acid (3.7 kBq/well) for 12 h before the assay. PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α in the culture medium were quantified as described above.Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Binding Analysis—SPR measurements were carried out with BIAcore 2000 (BIAcore AB). Recombinant human H-PGDS, rat H-PGDS, or mutants of the latter were coupled to a CM-5 sensor chip by the amine coupling method. An empty flow cell was used as a negative control. The binding of HQL-79 to the immobilized H-PGDS (12 ng of protein giving 10,000 response units per flow cell) was measured by using the co-injection mode at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Before the loading of HQL-79, the chip was equilibrated for 90 s with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and various concentrations of GSH (0–2 mm). HQL-79 at various concentrations in the same buffer was injected for 90 s. The sensorgram for the empty surface was subtracted from that for the H-PGDS-immobilized surface with control software to obtain the sensorgram for the specific interaction. The Kd values were derived from the sensorgrams after subtraction of linear, non-saturated baseline responses by steady-state analysis with BIA evaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore AB).Crystallization and Structure Determination—The crystallization of the quaternary complex comprising human H-PGDS, HQL-79, GSH, and Mg2+ was achieved by a soaking method. The crystals of the ternary complex of the enzyme with GSH and Mg2+ were first obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method (15Inoue T. Irikura D. Okazaki N. Kinugasa S. Matsumura H. Uodome N. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Miyano M. Kai Y. Urade Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and then HQL-79 powder was added to the hanging-drop. In a few days the powder disappeared from the mother liquor, which consisted of 17% (w/v) PEG 6000, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 5 mm GSH, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% (v/v) dioxane. The crystals were then soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing 23% glycerol and flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K prior to data collection. Diffraction data beyond 1.45-Ä resolution were collected at beamline 41XU at SPring-8, Japan. The complex structure was determined by the molecular replacement method with AMoRE (25Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) by using the native structure as the search model (PDB code: 1IYH; Ref. 15Inoue T. Irikura D.

The model rebuilding and the refinement of the structure were performed with O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr.

The inhalation of antigen significantly increased the PGD2 content in the BALF by 1.6-fold in WT mice (from 30 to 50 pg/lung) and by 4.9-fold in TG mice (from 52 to 253 pg/lung). The PGE2 and PGF2α contents in the BALF were increased by 2.9- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in WT mice (from 17 and 19 to 48 and 46 pg/lung, respectively) and by 2.4- and 1.5-fold in TG mice (from 53 and 75 to 131 and 110 pg/lung, respectively). Orally administered HQL-79 at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg decreased the PGD2 content in WT mice to the basal level and that in TG mice to 65 and 40%, respectively, of the content without HQL-79 treatment. However, PGE2 and PGF2α contents in the BALF were not decreased by the inhibitor.FIGURE 2H-PGDS inhibition by HQL-79 in vivo. A, selective inhibition of the PGD2 release into BALF of OVA-sensitized WT and H-PGDS-TG mice by oral administration of HQL-79. HQL-79 (1–30 mg/kg) was administered 1 h before the antigen challenge. PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α in BALF were determined by EIA. Data represent the mean ± S.E.

HQL-79 also inhibited the infiltration of eosinophils to 31% in WT but had no effect in H-PGDS-TG mice (Fig. 2B). The suppressive effect of HQL-79 on the infiltration of the total cells and eosinophils in BALF was also observed in H1R-KO and WT (C57BL/6 strain) mice. Orally administered HQL-79 (30 mg/kg) decreased the numbers of total cells and eosinophils in BALF to 62 and 54%, respectively, in WT and to 60 and 52%, respectively, in H1R-KO mice (Fig. 2B). The administration of HQL-79 also decreased the PGD2 content in both H1R-KO and WT (C57BL/6 strain) mice, similarly as in the WT (FVB strain) mice (data not shown).These results indicate that HQL-79 is an orally active H-PGDS inhibitor and a new candidate of anti-asthmatic drugs that suppress PGD2 production. These results also indicate that the anti-asthmatic effect of HQL-79 was not attributed to its antagonist activity toward H1R, although HQL-79 had been developed as an H1R antagonist (17Matsushita N. Aritake K. Takada A. Hizue M. Hayashi K. Mitsui K. Hayashi M. Hirotsu I. Kimura Y. Tani T. Nakajima H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 78: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Specific Inhibition of H-PGDS in Cell Lines by HQL-79—Quantification by EIA of the amounts of PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α released into the culture medium revealed that HQL-79 selectively inhibited the PGD2 production catalyzed by H-PGDS and only marginally affected the production of other prostanoids (Fig. 3). HQL-79 (3–100 μm) dose-dependently inhibited either antigen- or Ca2+-ionophore-induced production of PGD2 in rat mastocytoma RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 3A), which express predominantly H-PGDS (28Li L. Yang Y. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4725-4729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). HQL-79 at a concentration of 100 μm statistically significantly decreased antigen-induced PGD2 production to 7.6 ng/106 cells from the 12.2 ng/106 vehicle-treated cells, whereas it slightly increased PGE2 production to 0.33 ng/106 cells from the 0.05 ng/106 vehicle-treated cells and decreased PGF2α production to 1.4 ng/106 cells from the 1.5 ng/106 vehicle-treated cells. HQL-79 (100 μm) also significantly decreased Ca2+-ionophore-induced PGD2 production to 23 ng/106 cells from the 48 ng/106 vehicle-treated cells, whereas it increased PGE2 production to 0.76 ng/106 cells from the 0.19 ng/106 vehicle-treated cells and decreased PGF2α production to 4.5 ng/106 cells from the 5.4 ng/106 vehicle-treated cells.FIGURE 3Inhibition of H-PGDS activity by HQL-79 in vitro.

MEG-01S and HEK-293 cells were prelabeled with [1-14C]arachidonic acid and stimulated with 5 μm A23187 for 15 min in the presence of various concentrations of HQL-79 (3–300 μm). Radiolabeled arachidonic acid and its metabolites were extracted from the culture medium, separated by TLC, and analyzed by autoradiography.

Moreover, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate the expression of Ids. We hypothesized that BMP4 and Id proteins play a role in the expansion and differentiation of epithelial progenitor cells. We demonstrate that BMP4 induces the expression of Id2 along with the expansion of AR42J pancreatic epithelial cells. Furthermore, neutralization of BMP4 significantly reduced duct epithelial cell expansion in a mouse model of islet regeneration. BMP4 stimulation promotes Id2 binding to the bHLH transcription factor NeuroD, which is required for the differentiation of pancreatic islet cells. Therefore, our results indicate that BMP4 stimulation blocks the differentiation of endocrine progenitor cells and instead promotes their expansion thereby revealing a novel paradigm of signaling explaining the balance between expansion and differentiation of pancreatic duct epithelial progenitors. Understanding the mechanisms of BMP and Id function elucidates a key step during pancreas embryogenesis, which is important knowledge for expanding pancreatic progenitors in vitro.

Therefore, our results indicate that BMP4 stimulation blocks the differentiation of endocrine progenitor cells and instead promotes their expansion thereby revealing a novel paradigm of signaling explaining the balance between expansion and differentiation of pancreatic duct epithelial progenitors. Understanding the mechanisms of BMP and Id function elucidates a key step during pancreas embryogenesis, which is important knowledge for expanding pancreatic progenitors in vitro. The progression of pancreatic progenitors into the differentiated endocrine or exocrine lineage is governed by the sequential expression of key transcription factors. Several basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 2The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. transcription factors, which bind to regulatory E box segments (CANNTG) of target genes, are important for pancreas development. For example, Ngn3 is specifically required for the development of the endocrine cells, as was demonstrated in null mice (1Gradwohl G. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Guillemot F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Hes-1, another bHLH factor, is a critical repressor of endocrine differentiation, because in its absence accelerated differentiation of endocrine cells occurs (2Jensen J. Pedersen E.E. Galante P. Hald J. Heller R.S. Ishibashi M. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Serup P. Madsen O.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 3Habener J.F. Kemp D.M. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Moreover, NeuroD regulates the survival and terminal differentiation of pancreatic beta cells (4Naya F.J. Huang H.P. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F.J. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms regulating the biological activities of these bHLH transcription factors are not completely understood. Inhibition of differentiation proteins (Ids), comprised of four members (Id1-Id4), are a family of proteins that are implicated in a number of cellular processes, including control of proliferation and differentiation (5Benezra R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G. Sablitzky F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 58-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major role of Id proteins is to bind to and inhibit the function of bHLH transcription factors such as those described above that are critical for pancreatic development. Id proteins lack basic DNA-binding domains and heterodimers between Id and bHLH proteins cannot bind DNA, allowing them to inhibit the biological activity of these transcription factors (7Lasorella A. Uo T. Iavarone A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8326-8333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this sense, Ids inhibit transcription factor binding and may serve to regulate the timing of key events during pancreatic ontogeny. Indeed, the expression of Ids has been detected in the fetal pancreas in a microarray study (9Gu G. Wells J.M. Dombkowski D. Preffer F. Aronow B. Melton D.A. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Importantly, Id2 has been shown to prevent NeuroD from binding to its DNA target (10Ghil S.H. Jeon Y.J. Suh-Kim H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2002; 34: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because NeuroD is required for pancreatic islet development, we hypothesized that Id proteins may be important in regulating its biological function, thereby affecting the kinetics of cell growth and differentiation. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are pleiotropic proteins that regulate proliferation, differentiation, and migration of various cell types (reviewed in Ref. 11ten Dijke P. Korchynskyi O. Valdimarsdottir G. Goumans M.J. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2003; 211: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). BMPs signal through heteromeric complex combinations of types I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors and their nuclear effectors, SMADs (11ten Dijke P. Korchynskyi O. Valdimarsdottir G. Goumans M.J. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2003; 211: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Binding of BMP to at least one type I and type II receptor is necessary for signaling (12Nohe A. Keating E. Knaus P. Petersen N.O. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Interestingly, reverse transcription (RT) PCR analysis of mouse embryonic pancreas demonstrates expression of BMP4, -5, and -7, as well as BMP type I and II receptors (13Dichmann D.S. Miller C.P. Jensen J. Scott Heller R. Serup P. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, BMP signaling molecules, including SMADs 1, 2, and 4, are expressed in neonatal and adult pancreatic islets (14Brorson M. Hougaard D.M. Nielsen J.H. Tornehave D. Larsson L.I. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 116: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and BMP4, -5, and -6 promote the proliferation and development of epithelial islet-like structures in vitro (15Jiang F.X. Stanley E.G. Gonez L.J. Harrison L.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 753-760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies also implicate BMPs as propluripotency factors. In particular, BMP4 has been reported to enhance mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal (16Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar, 17Qi X. Li T.G. Hao J. Hu J. Wang J. Simmons H. Miura S. Mishina Y. Zhao G.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and is necessary for the production of hematopoietic progenitors (18Park C. Afrikanova I. Chung Y.S. Zhang W.J. Arentson E. Fong Gh G. Rosendahl A. Choi K. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 19Sadlon T.J. Lewis I.D. D'Andrea R.J. Stem Cells. 2004; 22: 457-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As SMAD-binding elements are found in the promoter of Id proteins (20Hollnagel A. Oehlmann V. Heymer J. Ruther U. Nordheim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19838-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), BMPs have been shown to regulate the expression of Id proteins in several cell types, including embryonic stem cells (20Hollnagel A. Oehlmann V. Heymer J. Ruther U. Nordheim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19838-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 21Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massague J.

Kageyama R. Taga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5868-5873Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), This indicates that BMPs can control the expression of Ids, which in turn, could regulate the biological activity of bHLH transcription factors. However, the role of BMP and Id protein signaling in regulating expansion of pancreatic progenitors has not been explored. Clearly, a more complete knowledge of the function of this family of proteins in pancreatic islet development would allow us to understand the biology behind the maintenance of progenitor cells and the regulation of differentiation in the pancreas. We hypothesize that BMP4 and Id2 proteins play prominent roles in pancreatic ontogeny and regeneration by affecting islet progenitor cell expansion during the differentiation of pancreatic islet cells. In this report, we show that BMP4 and Id proteins regulate the expansion of AR42J cells, a pancreatic epithelial cell line with the potential to differentiate into endocrine cells in vitro (24Zhang Y.Q. Kanzaki M. Furukawa M. Shibata H. Ozeki M. Kojima I. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Kojima I. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 10-14Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that BMP4 is necessary for the hyperplasia of duct cells during pancreatic islet regeneration. To define the functional mechanism of BMP4 regulation of progenitor cell expansion, we demonstrate that BMP4 exposure enhances binding of Id proteins to the bHLH transcription factor NeuroD. Our work dissects a critical signaling pathway for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation of endocrine progenitors. Animal Housing and Cell Lines—IFNγNOD mice were backcrossed onto the NODShi background and were maintained in the specific pathogen-free barrier facility at The Scripps Research Institute. AR42J cells were a generous gift from Dr. Itaru Kojima (Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation, Gunma University, Maebashi, Japan) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2. All studies were conducted in strict accordance with the TSRI Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Immunocytochemistry—Tissue sections (4 μm) were subjected to immunohistochemistry using commercial polyclonal antibodies including Id2 (1:600, 1:1000), BMPR2 (1:50), BMP4 (1:50) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), insulin (1:1000) (Dako, Denmark), BrdUrd (1:50) (Accurate Chemical, San Diego, CA), PAX6 (1:100) (Convance, CA), and NeuroD (1 μg/ml) (Cemines, La Jolla, CA and Chemicon, Temecula, CA). An avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase system was used to visualize bound antibody (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and 3,3-diaminobenzedine (Sigma) was used as the chromagen. Samples were counterstained with hematoxylin. In some cases, images were acquired using a Zeiss 2100 confocal microscope with a 60× objective, and RGB micrographs were compiled with Image J software. Western Immunoblotting—AR42J cells were lysed in 2× sample buffer (0.13 mol/liter Tris-base, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, and 4% SDS). Aliquots were taken for protein determination using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). The remaining cell extracts were denatured in 4× sample buffer (0.13 mol/liter Tris, 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose or Immobilon polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) overnight in transfer buffer (25 mmol/liter tris-base, 192 mmol/l glycine, pH 8.3, and 20% methanol). The membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk powder in Tris buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20, then probed with the indicated antibody and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Equal loading of protein was assessed by reprobing the membrane for actin. The densitometry analysis was carried out using Image J software. Briefly, the intensity of images of scanned Western blots was determined, and a ratio of each band to its actin control was calculated. Co-immunoprecipitation—AR42J cells were growth-arrested in medium lacking fetal calf serum, stimulated with BMP4 (100 ng/ml) for 18 h, and the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Equal amounts of protein (400-600 μg) were precleared with 50 μl of TrueBlot anti-rabbit Ig IP beads (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of Id2 antibody (2h, 4 °C), and then pulled down with TrueBlot anti-rabbit Ig IP beads. The samples were lysed in 2× sample buffer, and equal volumes of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed for the indicated antibody. The protein levels were determined by reprobing the blot with the Id2 antibody. IFNγ Duct Cell Isolation—Pancreatic duct cell isolation was performed as described previously (26Kayali A.G. Stotland A. Gunst K.V. Kritzik M. Liu G. Dabernat S. Zhang Y.Q. Wu W. Sarvetnick N. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 185: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, each IFNγNOD pancreas was treated with 1 mg/ml collagenase P in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12 with slight agitation at 37 °C for 30 min. The duct preparation was then filtered through a 200-μm mesh, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with 0.05% trypsin, EDTA at 37 °C for 10-15 min. Fetal calf serum was added to stop the trypsin treatment, and the duct preparation was washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Finally, duct cells were filtered over a 70-μm cell strainer and cultured in 10% fetal calf serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's F-12 medium overnight. For BMP4 treatment, duct cells were growth-arrested in 0.5% fetal calf serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's F-12 medium for 24 h before the addition of BMP4 (1-100 ng/ml) for 18 h. For some of the experiments, the duct epithelial cells isolated from IFNγNOD pancreas were pretreated with the neutralizing antibody to BMP4 (1-10 μg/ml) for 2 h before the addition of recombinant BMP4. BMP4 Neutralizing Antibody Treatment and BrdUrd Count—To ascertain whether BMP4 signaling affects pancreatic duct cell expansion, we injected mice intravenously with a neutralizing antibody to BMP4 (200 μg) (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) three times a week for 2 weeks. These mice were injected with BrdUrd (100 μg/g) intraperitoneally on day 15 and sacrificed on day 16, and the tissue was harvested and fixed for histology. After sections were cut, the tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Every fifth section was stained with antibody to BrdUrd, and the cells were counted for BrdUrd-positive duct cells in at least 10 fields per section. The labeled cells were evaluated as the percentage of BrdUrd-labeled cells out of the total number of epithelial cells per duct (27Kayali A.G. Van Gunst K. Campbell I.L. Stotland A. Kritzik M. Liu G. Flodstrom-Tullberg M. Zhang Y.Q. Sarvetnick N. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y.Q. Cleary M.M. Si Y. Liu G. Eto Y. Kritzik M. Dabernat S. Kayali A.G. Sarvetnick N. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2024-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Statistics—Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. and analyzed using Instat (GraphPad Software Inc.). Comparisons were made by Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. BMP4 Regulates Id Expression in AR42J Cells and Induces Cell Proliferation—The AR42J cell line is a pluripotent cell line derived from a rat pancreatic acinar carcinoma, which are acinar-like cells when exposed to dexamethasone (29Rosewicz S. Riecken E.O. Wiedenmann B. Clin. Investig. 1992; 70: 205-209PubMed Google Scholar), and in contrast, convert into insulin-producing cells with betacellulin and activin A treatment (24Zhang Y.Q. Kanzaki M. Furukawa M. Shibata H. Ozeki M. Kojima I. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, AR42J cells have the potential to become exocrine or endocrine cells, making them a valuable in vitro correlate to study the mechanisms of beta cell differentiation as well as for expansion of pancreatic progenitors. We tested the hypothesis that BMP4 regulates the expression of Id protein and is required for cell expansion in AR42J pancreatic cells. To this end, AR42J cells were growth-arrested and then treated with recombinant BMP4 for 18 h, and the expression of Id was quantitated by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Id1 and Id3 were not detected (data not shown), whereas Id2 was present, and its expression was inducible by recombinant BMP4. Densitometric analysis showed that BMP4 increased Id2 expression by 2 ± 0.6-fold over untreated control cells (Fig. 1B). BMP antagonists, such as noggin, regulate the activities of BMPs by forming a complex with them and preventing their binding to BMP receptors (30Zimmerman L.B. De Jesus-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 31Canalis E. Economides A.N. Gazzerro E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 218-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). We found that pretreatment of AR42J cells with noggin (5 μg/ml) significantly reduced BMP4-dependent stimulation of Id2 protein expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that Id protein expression is induced by BMP4 signaling in pancreatic epithelial cells. To determine whether BMP4 regulates AR42J cell proliferation, we growth-arrested the cells and stimulated them with BMP4 for 18 h with the addition of [3H]thymidine during the last 2 h. The growth index of the cultured AR42J cells was determined by quantitatively measuring [3H]thymidine uptake. We found that BMP4 increased [3H]thymidine counts after 18 h of BMP4 stimulation compared with control cells grown without BMP4 (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1C). We confirmed these results utilizing BrdUrd incorporation experiments. After 2 h of pulsing with BrdUrd, we observed an increased proportion of AR42J cells stimulated with BMP4 that were BrdUrd positive as determined by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1, D and E). These results demonstrate that BMP4 stimulates the expansion of pancreatic progenitor cells. BMP Signaling Molecules and Id2 Are Expressed in the Pancreatic Epithelium of Embryonic, Adult, and Regenerating IFNγNOD Pancreas—BMP4 and its receptors are expressed in the embryonic pancreas (13Dichmann D.S. Miller C.P. Jensen J. Scott Heller R. Serup P. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Jiang F.X. Stanley E.G. Gonez L.J. Harrison L.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 753-760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because we observed that BMP4 exposure promotes Id2 expression in AR42J progenitor cells, we next asked whether these factors are expressed in the developing and adult pancreas. We performed immunolocalization experiments and found that Id2-expressing cells were located in the embryonic pancreas but not strikingly colocalized with insulin (Fig. 2). Next, we studied the expression of BMP signaling proteins in mice that express IFNγ (IFNγNOD) driven by the insulin promoter. These mice are ideal for studying pancreatic regeneration as they demonstrate ductal hyperplasia and recapitulate several aspects of pancreas development (32Gu D. Sarvetnick N. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 33-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gu D. Sarvetnick N. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1994; 49: 161-165PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive BMP4 and BMPR2 expression were found to be localized to “islet-like” regions and in the small ducts (Fig. 2, D and E) of this transgenic strain. Likewise, in the regenerating IFNγNOD pancreas, Id2 expression was strong in duct epithelial cells (Fig. 2F). Moreover double-labeling experiments demonstrated that the majority of Id2-positive cells do not express insulin (Fig. 2, G-I). To ascertain the potential relevance of Id2 in epithelial cell expansion in the IFNγNOD pancreas, we stained the pancreas for BrdUrd and Id2 and performed confocal analysis. We found that a subset of Id2 positive cells also incorporated BrdUrd (Fig. 2, J-L). Therefore, cells harboring BMP, its receptor, and Id2 are found within the epithelial regions of the developing and regenerating mouse pancreas, suggesting that these molecules may regulate expansion of duct epithelial progenitor cells. BMP4 Regulates Id Protein Expression and Pancreatic Duct Cell Expansion in IFNγNOD—We asked whether Id proteins are induced by BMPs in pancreatic duct cells. We isolated IFNγNOD duct epithelial cells (because this strain expressed the BMPR2 in the epithelium), growth arrested the cultures, and then stimulated them with recombinant BMP4 protein. We focused on the effect of BMP4 on Id2, because it is found exclusively in duct epithelial cells of the IFNγNOD pancreas. We found that Id2 expression was enhanced in the presence of BMP4 by 2-fold (Fig. 3A). We further found that when these duct epithelial cells were treated with a neutralizing BMP4 antibody, Id2 expression was reduced, supporting the notion that Id2 propagates BMP4 signals in the pancreatic epithelium (Fig. 3). We next asked whether BMP4 regulates epithelial cell expansion in vivo. Because the IFNγNOD strain displays ductal hyperplasia, it represents a model to test whether BMP4 regulates cellular proliferation in the pancreas. To ascertain whether BMP4 signaling affects pancreatic duct epithelial cell expansion, we injected mice intravenously with the neutralizing antibody to BMP4 (34Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Fig. 3, B and C, depicts a representative histological section of the IFNγNOD pancreas tissue stained for BrdUrd in the control and BMP4 neutralizing antibody-treated groups, demonstrating a reduction in BrdUrd-positive epithelial cells following anti-BMP treatment. We determined the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells and found that in control animals, the average percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells is 17 ± 7, whereas treatment with the BMP4 neutralizing antibody reduced expansion to 8 ± 3% (n = 5 animals/condition, p = 0.003) (Fig. 3D). Our cumulative data demonstrate that BMP4 regulates the expansion of pancreatic duct epithelial cell progenitors in vivo. BMP4 Promotes the Binding of Id2 with NeuroD and Increases PAX6 Expression—Id proteins regulate the biological activity of bHLH transcription factors. NeuroD is a bHLH transcription factor that is important for the terminal differentiation of the endocrine lineage in the pancreas (4Naya F.J. Huang H.P. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F.J. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Because NeuroD is required for the terminal differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells, we asked whether it was found in the pancreatic epithelium during regeneration, and whether Id proteins might affect the expansion of pancreatic epithelial cells by inhibiting the differentiation program promoted by NeuroD. We found that NeuroD immunoreactivity was present in ductal cells, and in islet-like areas of the regenerating pancreas, but the overall level of immunoreactivity was not altered by inhibiting BMP4 signaling (Fig. 4, A and B). We next asked whether BMP treatment could enhance the binding of Id2 and NeuroD. Using immunoprecipitation experiments, we determined that recombinant BMP4 treatment increased the amount of Id2 bound to NeuroD. The ratio of bound NeuroD to the immunoprecipitated Id2 was 0.8 compared with 0.5 in untreated samples (Fig. 4, C and D). Interestingly, we did not observe any increase in NeuroD levels in the total cell lysate (data not shown), suggesting that regulation is enacted through protein-protein interactions or through induction of Id2 expression, as demonstrated above. These data therefore reveal that BMP4 regulates the accumulation and expansion of ductal progenitor epithelial cells through the activity of Id proteins and their bHLH targets. PAX6 is an important transcription factor in the regulation of pancreatic morphogenesis (35Ashery-Padan R. Zhou X. Marquardt T. Herrera P. Toube L. Berry A. Gruss P. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Importantly, it has been demonstrated that NeuroD binds specifically to E boxes in the promoter of PAX6, regulating its expression (36Marsich E. Vetere A. Di Piazza M. Tell G. Paoletti S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We asked whether neutralization of BMP4 affected PAX6 expression. We stained the BMP4-neutralized IFNγNOD mouse pancreas with an antibody to PAX6. We found increased numbers of PAX6-positive cells and enhanced intensity of PAX6 expression in the BMP4-neutralized pancreata compared with controls (Fig. 4, E and F). These results demonstrate the BMP pathway affects the expression of this critical factor for islet differentiation through NeuroD regulation. Id proteins are important in the regulation of cell proliferation and inhibition of differentiation. Our studies demonstrate the importance of BMP4 induction of Id2 in ductal progenitor cell expansion in the pancreas. We showed that BMP4 stimulated Id2 expression and induced cellular proliferation in AR42J cells. Furthermore, BMP signaling proteins and Id2 are expressed in the developing and regenerating mouse pancreas. The importance of BMP4 in epithelial duct cell expansion was ascertained by neutralization of BMP4, which significantly reduced BrdUrd incorporation during pancreatic regeneration. Therefore, our results are consistent with the paradigm that BMP4 signaling is important for ductal expansion. Moreover, we unraveled a link between BMP4 and Id2, which contributes to endocrine-specific differentiation in the pancreas. We have observed that BMP4 induces Id2 expression and its binding to NeuroD, a bHLH transcription factor critical for endocrine differentiation during pancreatic development. Furthermore, in the IFNγNOD pancreas, neutralizing BMP4 enhanced PAX6 immunoreactivity, a transcription factor that has been previously demonstrated to be a target of NeuroD, thereby indicating enhanced NeuroD activity in the absence of BMP4. Our results support the hypothesis that BMP4 is critical for the expansion of pancreatic duct epithelial progenitors and perhaps in the maintenance of their predifferentiated state (Fig. 5). BMPs and Ids in Cell Growth—The importance of BMP signaling in growth has been amply demonstrated. For example, SMAD1 regulates lung morphogenesis in an explant culture model by reducing lung epithelial branching, cell proliferation, and differentiation (37Chen C. Chen H. Sun J. Bringas Jr., P. Chen Y. Warburton D. Shi W. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: 1033-1039Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, exposure to low concentrations of BMP4 promoted proliferation of subventricular zone progenitors (38Liu S.Y. Zhang Z.Y. Song Y.C. Qiu K.J. Zhang K.C. An N. Zhou Z. Cai W.Q. Yang H. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 190: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BMP4 promotes proliferation of committed neuronal progenitors, as well as facilitating their commitment into astrocytes (38Liu S.Y. Zhang Z.Y. Song Y.C. Qiu K.J. Zhang K.C. An N. Zhou Z. Cai W.Q. Yang H. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 190: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that BMP4 is essential for the growth of pancreatic epithelial cells in AR42J cells in vitro as well as in a regenerating pancreas model. Id protein expression correlates with cell proliferation and inhibition of differentiation in many cell types. In the pancreas, Id2 expression was demonstrated to be elevated in both cancerous pancreatic tissues and in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell line (39Kleeff J. Maruyama H. Ishiwata T. Sawhney H. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Korc M. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 1202-1216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells, ectopic expression of Id1 allowed for continued proliferation (40Swarbrick A. Akerfeldt M.C. Lee C.S. Sergio C.M. Caldon C.E. Hunter L.J. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, Id protein signaling is known to intersect with cell cycle regulatory functions, and deregulation of Ids may lead to tumorigenesis (7Lasorella A. Uo T. Iavarone A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8326-8333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Yokota Y. Mori S. J. Cell Physiol. 2002; 190: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 42Ruzinova M.B. Benezra R. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 410-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). However, the function of Id proteins in the growth of progenitor cells in the pancreas has not previously been studied. Here, using AR42J cells and in vivo studies, we demonstrated that BMP4 acts upstream of Id2 and that these signaling molecules are required for pancreatic epithelial cell expansion. Id Proteins Are Regulated by BMPs—We found that exposure to BMPs caused the induction of Id protein expression in AR42J cells as well as in isolated IFNγNOD epithelial duct cells. Several other interesting studies have also linked BMPs with the expression of Ids (reviewed in Ref. 11ten Dijke P. Korchynskyi O. Valdimarsdottir G. Goumans M.J. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2003; 211: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Importantly, SMAD-binding elements are found on Id gene promoters (21Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massague J. Rosa J.L.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 410-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In addition, BMP4 contributes to astrocyte lineage commitment through Id-mediated inhibition of OLIG and E2A transcription factors (43Samanta J. Kessler J.A. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 4131-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Id1, Id2, and Id3 are up-regulated following BMP stimulation in osteogenic cells. Furthermore, microarray gene analysis of epithelial cells stimulated with BMP7 showed induction of Ids, which prevented TGF-β-induced growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (44Kowanetz M. Valcourt U. Bergstrom R. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4241-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Similar to our studies in the pancreas, the up-regulated Id genes promoted cell proliferation and inhibited differentiation. Clearly, BMP-dependent Id activity is a positive regulator of proliferation and a modulator of cell differentiation. Our data using AR42J cells and isolated IFNγNOD ductal epithelial cells showed that Id2 is induced by BMP4 signaling. Thus BMPs may promote expansion via their ability to suppress terminal differentiation, a process that is mediated by bHLH transcription factors. BMPs Are Important Factors in Cell Fate Determination—BMPs are important for directing the cell fate of several cell types, including mesenchymal cells (45Rajan P. Panchision D.M. Newell L.F. McKay R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). NeuroD is a bHLH transcription factor expressed in pancreatic, intestinal, and neural tissue, and plays a prominent role in endocrine lineage commitment and regulation of insulin gene transcription (4Naya F.J. Huang H.P. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F.J. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 46Lee J.E. Hollenberg S.M. Snider L. Turner D.L. Lipnick N. Weintraub H. Science. 1995; 268: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Clinically, mutations in NeuroD cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). NeuroD null mice have a striking reduction in the number of beta cells, develop severe diabetes, and die perinatally (4Naya F.J. Huang H.P. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F.J. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 47Chae J.H. Stein G.H. Lee J.E. Mol. Cells. 2004; 18: 271-288PubMed Google Scholar), although the genetic background of the mice determines the severity of the phenotype, as neogenesis of beta cells can occur in NeuroD null mice (48Huang H.P. Chu K. Nemoz-Gaillard E. Elberg D. Tsai M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 541-551PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the neogenesis observed in this knock-out strain may arise from the propensity for expansion, which results from the absence of strong signals promoting terminal differentiation. Here, we show the net outcome of BMP4 on the regulation of endocrine differentiation, in which Id2 binding to NeuroD is regulated by BMP4. This relationship may underlie the distinct homeostasis of pancreatic progenitor cells compared with differentiated endocrine cells. NeuroD was previously shown to form heterodimers with E47, resulting in binding to the E-box of the insulin gene promoter and its transactivation (47Chae J.H. Stein G.H. Lee J.E. Mol. Cells. 2004; 18: 271-288PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of Id2 in COS M6 cells inhibited NeuroD from binding to its E-box target (10Ghil S.H. Jeon Y.J. Suh-Kim H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2002; 34: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that one of the targets of NeuroD in determining pancreas morphogenesis and maintaining endocrine cell type numbers is PAX6 (35Ashery-Padan R. Zhou X. Marquardt T. Herrera P. Toube L. Berry A. Gruss P. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 36Marsich E. Vetere A. Di Piazza M. Tell G. Paoletti S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, our data show an enhanced PAX6 immunoreactivity when BMP4 signaling is neutralized and NeuroD binding to Id2 is reduced. Therefore, Id proteins may regulate beta cell-specific gene expression through NeuroD. Overall, this is the first study to demonstrate that BMP4 and Id2 regulate expansion and differentiation of the endocrine lineage in pancreatic duct epithelial progenitors by inducing Id2 binding to NeuroD. These results will enhance our knowledge of the signaling pathways that are necessary for expansion of pancreatic progenitors and, subsequently, for their differentiation into beta cells for future therapeutic treatment of type I diabetes.

We showed previously that the Sox2 regulatory region 2 (SRR2) drives strong expression in these cells. Here we generated transgenic mouse strains with the β-geo reporter gene under the control of the SRR2 in order to examine the spatiotemporal function of this regulatory region. We show that the SRR2 functions specifically in neural stem/progenitor cells. However, unlike Nestin 2nd intronic enhancer, the SRR2 shows strong regional specificity functioning only in restricted areas of the telencephalon but not in any other portions of the central nervous system such as the spinal cord. We also show by in vitro clonogenic assay that at least some of these SRR2-functioning cells possess the hallmark properties of neural stem cells. In adult brains, we could detect strong β-geo expression in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and along the rostral migrating stream where actively dividing cells reside. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal interactions of POU and Sox factors with SRR2 in neural stem/progenitor cells.

Sox2 encodes an SRY-related high mobility group box transcription factor and is expressed in at least three types of stem cells, i.e. neural stem cells (NSC), embryonic stem (ES) cells, and trophoblast stem cells, but not in their differentiated derivatives (5Yuan H.

Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 219-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Gene targeting experiments have revealed a cell-autonomous requirement for Sox2 in multipotent cells in early embryonic development (8Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar), suggesting that Sox2 may also be involved in the maintenance of the stem cell state of NSCs. However, because Sox2 null mutant mice failed to develop beyond implantation, the role of this protein in brain could not be examined by conventional knock-out analysis. Notwithstanding, studies from several laboratories have demonstrated the importance of Sox2 for NSC identity. Graham et al. (13Graham V. Khudyakov J. Ellis P. Pevny L. Neuron. 2003; 39: 749-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) demonstrated that constitutive expression of Sox2 results in maintenance of the neural stem/progenitor cell state and blocks neuronal differentiation. In addition, Bylund et al. (14Bylund M. Andersson E. Novitch B.G. Muhr J. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) showed that the Sox2 protein plays an important role in maintaining neural progenitor identity by counteracting the function of the basic helix-loop-helix-containing proneural transcription factors. Most intriguingly, recent knock-down analyses with RNA interference technology have demonstrated a pivotal role for Sox2 in the conversion of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells into NSC-like cells (15Kondo T. Raff M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2963-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), suggesting that Sox2 function is not limited to maintenance of stem cell state but is also involved in acquisition of stem cell identity. Because Sox2 appears to play such an important role in NSCs, we have been interested in unraveling the regulatory mechanisms that control its transcription. We previously identified a Sox2 enhancer, termed Sox2 regulatory region 2 (SRR2), that is specific to ES cells in the pluri-potent state (16Tomioka M. Nishimoto M. Miyagi S. Katayanagi T. Fukui N. Niwa H. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We subsequently showed that the SRR2 also functions in neural stem/progenitor cells (17Miyagi S. Saito T. Mizutani K. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Iwama A. Nakauchi H. Masui S. Niwa H. Nishimoto M. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4207-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here we characterize the SRR2 function in the developing brain, and we show that it functions in neural stem/progenitor cells in the telencephalon but not in other regions of the CNS, such as the hindbrain and spinal cord. We also show by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using developing brain that Sox2 and class III POU proteins, such as Brn1 and Brn2, interact with the SRR2 enhancer specifically in the telencephalon, implicating that specific recruitment of Sox2-class III POU protein complexes on the SRR2 in the telencephalon is the key determinant for the regional specificity of SRR2 in embryonic brain. Plasmid Construction—The SRR2-β-geo reporter construct was generated as follows. SRR2 was amplified as a BglII/BamHI PCR fragment using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TAGGATCCCGGGGCGCTTTCTGCCCTTCAG-3′ and 5′-GCAGATCTAGCGCTGCAGTTTATCAAAGCA-3′. This fragment was ligated to the BamHI/NcoI tk promoter from the tk-Luc reporter plasmid (16Tomioka M. Nishimoto M. Miyagi S. Katayanagi T. Fukui N. Niwa H. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and the resulting BglII/NcoI fragment was isolated. Intronic sequence and a poly(A) signal sequence were isolated as an XbaI/SpeI PCR fragment, using the pGL2 basic plasmid (Promega) as a template. These two DNA fragments were mixed with an NcoI/ XbaI fragment from pGT1.81IresBgeo that bears the entire β-geo coding region (18Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nicholis J. Li M. Dani C. Robertoson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and then subcloned into a modified pBluescript II KS+ vector with a BglII site inserted between the KpnI and EcoRI sites. Generation of Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear DNA injection into fertilized oocytes from C57BL6 mice (19Hogan B. Beddington R. Costanitini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 217-252Google Scholar). Four lines (lines 16, 29, 43, and 54) showed reporter gene expression in the ventricular zone of the telencephalon at 10.5 days post-coitum (dpc) and 12.5 dpc and were propagated through breeding with C57BL6 mice. Neurosphere Culture—Neurospheres were generated from 12.5 dpc embryonic mouse brains as described previously (17Miyagi S. Saito T. Mizutani K. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Iwama A. Nakauchi H. Masui S. Niwa H. Nishimoto M. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4207-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Dissociated brain cells were cultured at clonal density (1,000 cells per well). Cells were cultured in medium with 200 μg/ml G418 when selecting β-geo-positive neurospheres. X-Gal Staining—Whole embryos (10.5 or 12.5 dpc) and floating sections (14.5 or 16.5 dpc) were stained with X-gal according to Zappone et al. (20Zappone M.V. Galli R. Catena R. Meani N. De Biasi S. Mattei E. Tiveron C. Vescovi A.L. Lovell-Badge R. Ottolenghi S. Nicolis S.K. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 2367-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adults were perfused with 1% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, and the brain was dissected, fixed for 90 min in the same fixative, and sectioned at 100 μm using a vibratome. Sections were post-fixed for 30 min, washed, and stained in the dark in PBS containing 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4(CN)6, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mg/ml X-gal for 4 h. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-Sox2 (rabbit IgG; Chemicon); anti-phosphohistone H3 (clone 6G3; Cell Signaling Technology); anti-MAP2 (clone HM-2; Sigma); anti-GFAP (clone GA5; Sigma); anti-PSA-NCAM (mouse IgM from Dr. Seki, University of Juntendo, Japan (21Seki T. Arai Y. Anat. Embryol. 1991; 184: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar)); anti-Nestin (clone RAT401; Pharmingen); anti-β-galactosidase (rabbit IgG; Biogenesis); anti-Brn1 (goat IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Brn2 (goat IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-acetylated histone H3 (rabbit IgG, Upstate); and anti-dimethylated histone H3-K4 (rabbit IgG, Abcam). Immunostaining—Immunocytochemistry was performed according to Hirabayashi et al. (22Hirabayashi Y. Itoh Y. Tabata H. Nakajima K. Akiyama T. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2791-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). For sections of embryonic brain tissue, dissected brains were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, frozen, and sectioned at 12 μm. Frozen sections were immunostained as described previously (17Miyagi S. Saito T. Mizutani K. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Iwama A. Nakauchi H. Masui S. Niwa H. Nishimoto M. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4207-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For sections of adult brain, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were dissected, post-fixed overnight in the same fixative as used for embryonic tissue, and sectioned at 50 μm using a vibratome. Free-floating sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with the appropriate Alexa Fluor dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Staining was visualized using confocal microscopy (Leica Microsystems). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—ChIP was performed according to Saba et al. (23Saba R. Johnson J.E. Saito T. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified using the following primers: SRR2, 5′-TCATTTCAGGTGTAGAGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCTATGTGTGAGCAAGAACTG-3′; Nestin enhancer, 5′-TTGTCTGTCACCAGCTCTGG-3′ and 5′-TTCGATCAGACTCCTCAGATC-3′; β-actin, 5′-GGTCAGAAGGACTCCTATGT-3′ and 5′-ATGAGGTAGTCTGTCAGGTC-3′; and c-Myc, 5′-GACGCTTGGCGGGAAA-3′ and 5′-CTCTGCACACACGGCTCTT-3′. Bisulfite Sequencing Analyses—1 μg of genomic DNA isolated from forebrain or spinal cord was digested with EcoRI and then subjected to bisulfite treatment, in which unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracil residues, as described by Clark et al. (24Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). The bisulfite-modified DNA was then used as a template for Nested PCR to amplify a region containing SRR2. The primers used for PCRs were as follows: 1st PCR, 5′-TTATTCAGTTCCCAATCCAAAC-3′ and 5′-TCAAATATATACCAAACCCCTTCC-3′; 2nd PCR, 5′-CAATCCAAACTAAACAAATTCC-3′ and 5′-ACATATACATTTTATACTATCC-3′. The PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and analyzed by sequencing. Injury Model—Adult SRR2-β-geo mice (10 weeks old) were anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotaxic frame as described by Johansson et al. (25Johansson C.B. Lothian C. Molin M. Okano H. Lendahl U. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The needle (Hamilton, 26-gauge) was inserted at 0.5 mm anterior and 1.3 mm lateral to bregma and 3.5 mm below the dura mater and then withdrawn. The animals were sacrificed after 4 days post-surgery. The SRR2 Enhancer Element Drives Reporter Gene Expression in the Ventricular Zone of the Telencephalon—Our recent in vitro experiments have demonstrated that the Sox2 enhancer SRR2 (+3300 to +3677, the adenine nucleotide of the translation initiation codon is set to +1) drives transcription in neural stem/progenitor cells (17Miyagi S. Saito T. Mizutani K. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Iwama A. Nakauchi H. Masui S. Niwa H. Nishimoto M. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4207-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To examine the spatiotemporal activity of SRR2, we generated SRR2-β-geo transgenic mice and examined β-galactosidase activity during development. To avoid any potential effects of chromosomal integration site on gene expression, we used a larger fragment (+3300 to +4124) that showed similar activity as the smaller fragment when introduced into E13.5 mouse brains by in utero electroporation (data not shown). Of 13 transgenic founder males tested, four (lines 16, 29, 43, and 54) generated progeny with β-galactosidase expression in the telencephalon at 10.5 and 12.5 dpc (data not shown, but see Fig. 1, A and B for reference), but no expression was detected in other parts of the nervous system. No β-galactosidase-expressing progenies were obtained from the remaining nine founders. Detailed examination of stable transgenic lines generated from the two founders (lines 16 and 54) exhibited essentially the same pattern of β-galactosidase expression at any developmental stages and adult stage (data not shown); therefore, we show only data obtained from line 16 (Fig. 1). At 8.5 dpc, endogenous Sox2 expression is evident in the neuroepithelium, which is largely composed of multipotent NSCs (8Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H. Perez L. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar, 26Komitova M. Eriksson P.S. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 369: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Ellis P.

Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect SRR2-β-geo reporter gene expression at this early stage of brain development (data not shown). β-Galactosidase expression became evident only after 10.5 dpc and was confined to the telencephalon (Fig. 1A). This pattern of expression persisted through later stages (Fig. 1, B and C). Sections of brains from 14.5 dpc (Fig. 1D) and 16.5 dpc (Fig. 1E) embryos revealed that SRR2 functioning domains resembled the expression profile of the gene, BF-1 encoding one of fork head type of transcription factors (29Tao W. Lai E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 957-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 30Hanashima C. Shen L. Li S.C. Lai E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6526-6536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. strong expression in the ganglionic eminence and most of the cortex. Although β-galactosidase expression covered almost the whole cortex at the rostral levels, it was excluded from the medial and dorsal cortex at the caudal levels. Strong β-galactosidase staining was detected in the ventricular zone (VZ), where undifferentiated neural stem/progenitor cells reside. However, expression was weak in the intermediate zone and was completely absent in the cortical plate (Fig. 1, D and E). Fig. 1, F and G, shows double β-galactosidase and Sox2 antibody staining of a sectioned 10.5 dpc brain, demonstrating extensive colocalization of SRR2 activity and endogenous Sox2. The SRR2 Functions in Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells but Not in Post-mitotic Neurons in the Developing Brain—To determine whether the β-galactosidase-positive cells in the VZ are neural stem/progenitor cells, we performed double antibody staining against β-galactosidase and either Nestin or MAP-2, which are markers for neural stem/progenitor cells and post-mitotic neurons, respectively, using forebrain from 14.5 dpc transgenic embryos. Expression domains of β-galactosidase and Nestin are overlapping in VZ cells of the developing telencephalon (Fig. 2, A-F), although the expression domains of β-galactosidase and MAP2 are mutually exclusive (Fig. 2, G-I). Immunostaining with anti-phosphohistone H3, a specific marker for mitotic cells, revealed that most phosphohistone H3-positive cells are also positive for β-galactosidase (Fig. 2, J-L). Although some cells are clearly positive for both β-galactosidase and Nestin, a substantial number of cells that are positive for Nestin are negative for β-galactosidase (Fig. 2, C and F). This apparent lack of colocalization may not represent the presence of Nestin+/β-galactosidase- cells but differences in the subcellular distribution of these two proteins. To determine whether or not the proteins are colocalized more clearly, forebrain tissue from transgenic embryos was dissociated into single cells and plated onto coverslips for antibody staining. Representative examples are shown in Fig. 2, M-T. We found that 95 ± 11.3% (n = 3) of β-galactosidase-positive cells are also positive for Nestin, whereas only 9.3 ± 2.1% (n = 3) of β-galactosidase-positive cells express MAP2. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the SRR2 enhancer functions mainly in Nestin-positive neural stem/progenitor cells but not in MAP2-positive post-mitotic neurons in the developing telencephalon. Cells Expressing β-Galactosidase under the Control of the SRR2 Element Include Neural Stem Cells—Because Nestin marks lineage-restricted progenitor cells in addition to neural stem cells, we performed clonogenic analyses in order to determine whether SRR2-β-geo cells in the telencephalon include bona fide neural stem cells. Dissociated cells from 12.5 dpc embryonic mouse brains were cultured at clonal density (1,000 cells/well) in the absence or presence of G418, which selects for SRR2-β-geo cells, and were permitted to develop into primary neurospheres. Under these conditions, more than 95% of the neurospheres generated were clonal, as revealed by mixing experiments using enhanced green fluorescent protein- or enhanced cyan fluorescent protein-positive cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, when cultured in G418-containing medium, neurospheres could be efficiently produced only from forebrain- and not mid/hindbrain-derived cells. Moreover, without G418 selection, neurospheres with strong β-galactosidase expression could be recovered only from the forebrain, although all neurospheres from the mid/hindbrain showed weak or no X-gal staining. These results indicate that regional specificity of the SRR2 element in the developing brain persists even in vitro. It is likely that the β-galactosidase-negative (or weakly positive) neurospheres in Fig. 3B, upper-left panel (asterisks), were derived from SRR2-negative cells in other parts of the telencephalon, such as the dorsal region (Fig. 3B). Neurospheres generated in the absence of G418 were composed exclusively of either β-galactosidase-positive or -negative cells, but never a mixture of the two, confirming that the neurospheres were indeed clonal. To assess the self-renewal capacity of SRR2-β-geo-positive cells, the efficiency of secondary neurosphere formation was compared between neurospheres obtained under and without G418 selection. We observed that primary neurospheres obtained under G418 selection show higher self-renewing ability than neurospheres obtained without G418 selection, although the difference is not prominent. Moreover, we found that neurospheres from SRR2-β-geo cells could be passaged and expanded in G418-containing media for at least 2 months (data not shown). Next, in order to examine the differentiation potential of SRR2-β-geo cells, G418-selected primary spheres were induced to differentiate in medium containing fetal bovine serum and retinoic acid and then stained with antibodies against neural cell markers. As shown in Fig. 3D, both neurons and glia, which are marked by MAP2 and GFAP, respectively, were detected in the progeny of single SRR2-β-geo cells. We conclude from these results that the SRR2-functioning neurosphere cell population contains at least equivalent or even higher amount of cells that possess the self-renewal and multipotent properties of neural stem cells compared with neurosphere cells obtained without G418 selection. The SRR2 Element Acts as an Enhancer in Adult Neurogenic Regions— New neurons are continually generated also in the adult vertebrate brain (1McKay R. Science. 1997; 276: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 2Gage F.H. Science. 2000; 287: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (4058) Google Scholar). However, unlike the embryonic stages, neurogenesis in the adult brain usually occurs only in restricted areas. In mammals, the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular layer (SGL) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus are known to be involved in neurogenesis at adult stages. Specifically, the slowly dividing SVZ astrocytes (also termed type B cells) have stem cell character and are able to generate neuroblasts (type A cells) via the transit amplifying cells (type C cells). These newly formed neuroblasts migrate through glial tunnels formed by SVZ astrocytes (rostral migrating stream (RMS)) and then differentiate into olfactory bulb neurons (31Doetsch F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 32Alvarez-Buylla A. Lim D.A. Neuron. 2004; 41: 683-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Because Sox2 is known to be expressed in these neurogenic regions (26Komitova M. Eriksson P.S. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 369: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 33Ferri A.L. Cavallaro M. Braida D. Di Cristofano A. Canta A. Vezzani A. Ottolenghi S. Pandolfi P.P. Sala M. DeBiasi S. Nicolis S.K. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3805-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 4A, right panel for reference), we examined SRR2 activity in the adult brain by X-gal staining. We were able to detect stained cells in the periventricular cells of the lateral ventricle (Fig. 4A) and along the RMS, which reaches to the olfactory bulb (Fig. 4B). β-Galactosidase expression in olfactory bulb neurons, in which Sox2 is not normally expressed, is likely due to perdurance of the protein. β-Galactosidase expression was also detected in the SGL of the dentate gyrus, albeit very weakly (data not shown). To further characterize the β-galactosidase-positive cells in the SVZ, we stained sections from SRR2-β-geo mouse brains with antibodies against GFAP and PSA-NCAM, which mark type B and A cells, respectively. As expected, most LacZ-positive cells also expressed either GFAP (Fig. 4, C-G) or PSA-NCAM (Fig. 4, H-L). These results suggest that the SRR2 element functions to up-regulate Sox2 expression in both type A and B cells. From the analyses of Nestin gene expression, it has been demonstrated that the numbers of reactive astrocytes increase in adult brain in response to injury (25Johansson C.B. Lothian C. Molin M. Okano H. Lendahl U. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we characterized the function of the SRR2 enhancer in the injured adult brain. With the aid of a stereotaxic frame, the brains of SRR2 transgenic mice were subjected to needle injury, and β-galactosidase expression was analyzed following injury. Data from three independent experiments indicate that the number of β-galactosidase-positive cells in the striatum close to the needle scar was about 3-fold higher than observed in the same region in sham-operated control mice (sham operated mice, 99 ± 21.2 versus injured mice, 289 ± 78.2 in 0.4 × 0.3 mm) (Fig. 4, M and Q), although no obvious change in β-galactosidase expression was evident in the ventricular wall. Immunostaining using anti-GFAP antibody suggests that the increased β-galactosidase-positive cells in number were reactive astrocytes (Fig. 4, O, P, and S-X) that proliferate as part of an injury response. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the SRR2 enhancer regulates Sox2 expression in neural stem/progenitor cells in adult neurogenic regions and reactive astrocytes in the striatum, and at least, β-galactosidase-positive reactive astrocytes respond to CNS injury. The SRR2 Enhancer Recruits Sox2 and Class III POU Proteins in the Telencephalon but Not in the Spinal Cord—In our previous studies, we demonstrated that an octamer- and Sox-binding sequence plays a pivotal role in mediating transcriptional activation via SRR2 in ES cells and the developing brain, and multimerization of this sequence is sufficient to drive reporter gene expression in neural stem/progenitor cells. Moreover, we showed that, like Oct-3/4, class III POU proteins such as Brn1 and Brn2, which are known to be expressed in neural stem and progenitor cells, can cooperate with Sox2 to enhance SRR2 activity in COS cells (17Miyagi S. Saito T. Mizutani K. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Iwama A. Nakauchi H. Masui S. Niwa H. Nishimoto M. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4207-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To further substantiate these data, we first examined the expression of these transcription factors in the developing brain. As expected, Sox2 was expressed in the VZ of the developing telencephalon (Fig. 5, A, D, and G). Brn1 and Brn2 were also expressed in VZ cells of the telencephalon. However, unlike Sox2, which is already detectable in the neural plate at early stages (for details, see Ref. 12Episkopou V. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 219-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), Brn1 expression was evident only after 11.5 dpc, with expression persisting until 14.5 dpc (Fig. 5, B and E) and dropping off by 16.5 dpc (Fig. 4H). Brn2 was strongly expressed in the VZ cells of the telencephalon only after 16.5 dpc, with only a weak signal detected at earlier stages (Fig. 5, C, F, and I). Together with the previously documented cooperative activation of the SRR2 enhancer by Sox2 and Brn, these observations may account for the inactivity of the SRR2 during early stages of neurogenesis (9.5 dpc). However, because we also observed expression of Brn1 and Brn2 in the spinal cord and diencephalon (Fig. 5, J-N), where Sox2 is expressed but SRR2 is inactive, we examined whether Sox2 and Brn can bind to SRR2 in vivo by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We immunoprecipitated chromatin from the foreb"
https://openalex.org/W2037015237,"Expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is elevated in malignant breast cancer, yet the role of intrinsic FAK activity in promoting tumor progression remains undefined. Here, we have inhibited FAK activity or expression in murine 4T1 breast carcinoma cells via dominant-negative focal adhesion kinase-related non-kinase (FRNK) or anti-FAK short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression, respectively. Neither FRNK nor FAK shRNA (∼80% reduced FAK levels) affected 4T1 proliferation in culture, whereas reduced FAK activity or expression blocked 4T1 cell invasion through Matrigel and resulted in 2–3-fold lower urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) expression. Control 4T1 cells implanted into mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice exhibited spontaneous metastasis to the lungs, to the peritoneal cavity, and resulted in 90% lethality within 21 days. Whereas FAK shRNA-expressing 4T1 cells formed tumors in mice with low levels of apoptosis, when mammary-injected, these cells did not exhibit lung metastasis after 21 days and caused only 40% lethality up to 60 days. Transient re-expression of wild-type but not kinase-dead FAK in 4T1 FAK shRNA cells promoted uPA production and mammary to lung metastasis within 7 days. In fact, stable human uPA overexpression in 4T1 FAK shRNA cells promoted Matrigel invasion and lung metastasis equal to 4T1 controls. Conversely, treatment with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or neutralizing antibody to uPA blocked Matrigel invasion of 4T1 control cells. These studies provide the first direct proof that FAK catalytic activity can facilitate metastatic breast cancer progression by regulating uPA expression."
https://openalex.org/W2075258871,"Cullins are a family of evolutionarily conserved proteins that bind to the small RING finger protein, ROC1, to constitute potentially a large number of distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases. CUL7 mediates an essential function for mouse embryo development and has been linked with cell transformation by its physical association with the SV40 large T antigen. We report here that, like its closely related homolog PARC, CUL7 is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and binds directly to p53. In contrast to PARC, however, CUL7, even when overexpressed, did not sequester p53 in the cytoplasm. We have identified a sequence in the N-terminal region of CUL7 that is highly conserved in PARC and a sequence spanning the tetramerization domain in p53 that are required for CUL7-p53 binding. CUL7 and MDM2 did not form a detectable tertiary complex with p53. In vitro, CUL7 caused only mono- or di-ubiquitination of p53 under the conditions MDM2 polyubiquitinated p53. Co-expression of CUL7 reduced the transactivating activity of p53. Constitutive ectopic expression of CUL7 increased the rate of cell proliferation and delayed UV-induced G2 accumulation in U2OS cells expressing functional p53, but had no detectable effect in p53-deficient H1299 cells. Deletion of the N-terminal domain of CUL7 or a mutation disrupting p53 binding abolished the ability of CUL7 to increase the rate of U2OS cell proliferation. Our results suggest that CUL7 functions to promote cell growth through, in part, antagonizing the function of p53."
https://openalex.org/W1969549635,"The MutL and MutS proteins are the central components of the DNA repair machinery that corrects mismatches generated by DNA polymerases during synthesis. We find that MutL interacts directly with the β sliding clamp, a ring-shaped dimeric protein that confers processivity to DNA polymerases by tethering them to their substrates. Interestingly, the interaction of MutL with β only occurs in the presence of single-stranded DNA. We find that the interaction occurs via a loop in MutL near the ATP-binding site. The binding site of MutL on β locates to the hydrophobic pocket between domains two and three of the clamp. Site-specific replacement of two residues in MutL diminished interaction with β without disrupting MutL function with helicase II. In vivo studies reveal that this mutant MutL is no longer functional in mismatch repair. In addition, the human MLH1 has a close match to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamp binding motif in the region that corresponds to the β interaction site in Escherichia coli MutL, and a peptide corresponding to this site binds proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The current report also examines in detail the interaction of β with MutS. We find that two distinct regions of MutS interact with β. One is located near the C terminus and the other is close to the N terminus, within the mismatch binding domain. Complementation studies using genes encoding different MutS mutants reveal that the N-terminal β interaction motif on MutS is essential for activity in vivo, but the C-terminal interaction site for β is not. In light of these results, we propose roles for the β clamp in orchestrating the sequence of events that lead to mismatch repair in the cell.

In light of these results, we propose roles for the β clamp in orchestrating the sequence of events that lead to mismatch repair in the cell. The process of chromosomal replication can generate small deletions, insertions, or mismatches in newly synthesized DNA. If left unrepaired, post-replicative DNA damage can lead to genomic instability and increased rates of mutation (1Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 2Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These types of replicative errors are corrected by a set of enzymes that are specialized in performing DNA mismatch repair (MMR) 2The abbreviations used are: MMR, mismatch repair; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; pol, polymerase; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. and are conserved across all domains of life. In Escherichia coli it is estimated that the fidelity of replication is increased >100-fold by the action of MMR (3Schaaper R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23762-23765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans a deficiency in MMR has been linked to increased susceptibility to certain sporadic cancers (4Kolodner R.D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 5Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 6Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 2000: 359-399Crossref Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The E. coli MutS protein is an essential component of MMR and it directly binds to abnormal DNA structures to initiate the cascade of events that lead to repair. These events include the removal of a segment of the newly synthesized DNA strand by the combined action of a helicase and one or more nucleases, and the re-synthesis of the resulting gap by a DNA polymerase (1Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). A second essential component of MMR in E. coli is MutL, which is thought to link the action of MutS with nucleases and a helicase (1Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 7Guarné A. Ramón-Maiques S. Wolff E.M. Ghirlando R. Hu X. Miller J.H. Yang W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4134-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, although the individual components of MMR in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are mostly well described, many of the details of the repair mechanism are still poorly defined. In eukaryotic organisms, MutS homologues MSH3 and MSH6 bind to the processivity factor PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) (8Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M.

Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), a homotrimeric protein clamp essential in DNA replication, which therefore provides a link between the MMR and replication machineries. Fluorescence microscopy has revealed that MMR enzymes colocalize with active replication centers in the cell (13Smith B.T. Grossman A.D. Walker G.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Kleczhowska H.E. Marra G. Lettieri T. Jiricny J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In addition, numerous genetic studies in yeast by Kolodner and collaborators show that a distinctive set of mutations in PCNA can result in MMR deficiency (15Chen C. Merrill B.J. Lau P.J. Holm C. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7801-7815Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Lau P.J. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6669-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Conversely, mutation of the PCNA-binding motif in either MSH3 or MSH6 abolishes the interaction with the clamp and results in yeast strains with elevated mutation rates (11Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In bacteria, MutS has been shown to interact with the β clamp, the processivity factor of DNA polymerase III (17López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PCNA and β are ring-shaped proteins that bind to DNA by encircling it, and are generally referred to as “sliding clamps.” Loading of PCNA and β onto DNA requires the action of “clamp loaders” (γ-complex in prokaryotes, replication factor C in eukaryotes), which are multisubunit ATPase machines that open the ring and place it around primed sites on DNA (18O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The β clamp tethers the replicase to DNA by binding it directly and sliding with it along DNA during chain elongation, converting it into a highly processive enzyme (19Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years it has become evident that sliding clamps interact with many other proteins involved in all aspects of DNA metabolism. Despite the diversity of the proteins that bind to PCNA or β, the interaction often has a common structure: proteins typically bind to the clamp via N- or C-terminal flexible extensions containing a short motif (20Warbrick E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 21Dalrymple B.P. Kongsuwan K. Wijffels G. Dixon N.E. Jennings P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and the interaction takes place at a hydrophobic pocket near the C terminus of the clamp. Detailed studies of the contact between clamps and their partners show that these interactions are often complex, with involvement of more than one binding surface, and in the case of PCNA even with mechanisms that regulate the interaction by post-translational modifications (22Indiani C. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 23Bunting K.A. Roe S.M. Pearl L.H.

Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). In addition, because PCNA is trimeric and β dimeric, it has been speculated that the ring could accommodate more than one ligand at the same time and therefore serve as a mobile platform that coordinates multiple enzymes performing sequential actions on DNA (22Indiani C. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Fujii S. Fuchs R.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4342-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). What is the precise role of processivity clamps in mismatch repair? Because clamps are typically associated with DNA polymerases, and clamp loaders are integral components of the replication fork, clamps could be used for targeting the MMR machinery to “replication factories” that could therefore contain synthetic errors. A second possibility is that they participate directly in the mechanism of action of mismatch repair. For example, MSH2-MSH6 binds to PCNA in the absence of a mismatch but not in its presence, suggesting that PCNA could help the MSH complex locate the mismatch on DNA (12Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 27Lau P.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, because clamps used by DNA polymerase have a distinct orientation on DNA, they could provide the MMR machinery with the means to discriminate between the parental DNA and the newly synthesized strands (2Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 4Kolodner R.D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between MMR and replication, we investigated in greater detail the physical interactions between E. coli MutL and MutS and the β clamp of DNA polymerase. We find that β binds directly to MutL. Interestingly, MutL only interacts with β in the presence of single-stranded (ss) DNA. Studies herein demonstrate that the site of contact with β is located on a loop in the N-terminal ATP-binding domain of MutL. Mutation of two residues within this loop reduces interaction with β, but does not influence MutL ATPase and function with helicase II. Mutation of these two residues abolish mismatch repair in vivo. In addition we have identified two points of contact on MutS that bind to β, one at the N terminus and another at the C terminus. The C-terminal site has a strong affinity for β, whereas the interaction with the N-terminal site is weak. Interestingly, only the N-terminal site is essential for mismatch repair in vivo. This work provides new insights into the role of β in mismatch repair in the cell, and suggests that the clamp is an essential player. We propose that β helps to order the sequence of events in this multistep repair pathway. Materials—High pressure liquid chromatography purified N-terminal biotinylated peptides were purchased from Bio-synthesis Inc. All other peptides were purchased from Chiron Mimotopes, which utilizes a synthetic method that leaves a diketopiperidine linker at the C terminus of the peptide. Streptavidin was purchased from Sigma. Labeled nucleotides were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled nucleotides and AMPPNP were from Amersham Biosciences. Proteins were purified as follows: β as described (28Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar); β containing a C-terminal 6-residue kinase recognition sequence and human PCNA with a 6-residue N-terminal tag were purified and labeled using [γ-32P]ATP as described (29Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); pol III core was reconstituted from isolated subunits and purified from unbound proteins as described (30Onrust R.

MutS and MutL Overexpression and Purification—The MutS gene was cloned into pET11c (Novagen) to yield pET-mutSwt. MutS mutants, MutSN (pET-mutSN) and MutSC (pET-mutSC), were generated using site-directed mutagenesis by the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Constructs were sequenced before use. Purification of MutS and MutS derivatives was based on the procedure described earlier (31Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For MutS and its derivatives, plasmids were transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and 12L of cells grown at 37 °C in LB media supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. When the cell culture reached an A600 = 0.6, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added and after a further 2-h incubation the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl) and lysed using a French press at 4 °C. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and the extract was mixed with a solution of 25% streptomycin sulfate (0.4 ml/1 ml of extract). After stirring, the precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was treated with solid ammonium sulfate (0.180 g/ml) at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the precipitate was resuspended in buffer A (20 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol) and dialyzed in the same buffer. This dialysate was applied to a heparin-Sepharose chromatography column (150-ml bed volume) and eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient of NaCl (25-500 mm). Fractions were analyzed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and those containing MutS were pooled, dialyzed against Buffer A, and then applied to a 200-ml column of fast-flow S-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer A. The S-Sepharose column was eluted with a 600-ml NaCl gradient (25-500 mm) in buffer A. MutS-containing fractions were pooled, precipitated with ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against buffer A, and then stored at -80 °C. The MutL gene was cloned in pET11c to yield pET-mutL. MutLLF in which residues Leu-150 and Phe-151 were replaced by alanine was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange) to yield pET-mutLLF. E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with pET-mutL or pET-mutLLF and grown, induced, and harvested as described above for MutS. MutL and MutLLF were purified as described (32Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that a fast-flow Q (Amersham Biosciences) column replaced the hydroxylapatite column. Protein Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assays using [32P]β (150 dpm/fmol) were performed as described by López de Saro and O'Donnell (17López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Reactions (15 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 50 nm [32P]β. Reactions also included peptide, streptavidin, MutS, DNA, MutL, or AMPPNP as indicated in the figure legends. Duplex DNA was a 300-mer duplex generated by PCR and gel purified, and ssDNA was a 90-mer synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-CCCCCTTATTAGCGTTTGCCATCTTTTCATAATCAAAATCACCGGAACCAGAGCCACCACCGGAACCGCCTCCCTCAGAGCCGCCACCCT-3′). After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, 5 μl of the reaction was applied to a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (4% acrylamide-bisacrylamide 29:1, 1× TBE buffer, 5% glycerol). Electrophoresis was performed in 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) at 19 mA for 90 min (4 °C). Gels were dried and detection of [32P]β was performed using a PhosphorImager. Free and bound forms of [32P]β were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) and the percentage of bound [32P]β obtained using the formula [32P]βbound = [32P]βbound × 100/[32P]βtotal. Concentrations of the addition of [32P]β ligands are indicated in each figure. Superdex 200 Chromatography—A 25-ml FPLC Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences, separation range 10,000-600,000 Da) was used to analyze MutS and its derivatives. The column buffer contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Wild-type MutS, MutS800, and MutSC were each loaded at a concentration of 25 μm in a volume of 200 μl. Fractions (420 μl) were collected and protein content measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Determination of Mutant Frequency—The wild-type strain used for the mutagenesis assay was AB1157 (F-thr-1 araC14 leuB6 Δ(gpt-proA)62 lacY1 tsx-33 supE44 galK2 hisG4 rfbD1 mgl-51 rpoS396 rpsL31 kdgK51 xylA5 mtl-1 argE3 thi-1) obtained from E. A. Adelberg (Yale University). Strains KM52 and KM75 (from K. C. Murphy, University of Massachusetts Medical School) were derived from AB1157 by replacement of the mutL and mutS coding regions by genes encoding chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance, respectively (33Murphy K.C. Campellone K.G. Poteete A.R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Strains were grown at 37 °C to saturation from single colonies in Brain Heart Broth (20 g/liter) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) when required. To determine the frequency of rifampicin resistance, aliquots were spread on L plates with or without ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and onto L plates containing rifampicin (100 μg/ml) with or without ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight before scoring. To determine Gal+papilation, 10-μl aliquots of the overnight cultures were spotted on MacConkey agar plates containing 0.2% galactose as the sole carbon source. The plates were scored after incubation for 3 days at 37 °C. Construction of the mutSC Chromosomal Mutant—Strain GM8607, containing the mutSc chromosomal deletion was constructed as described by Calmann et al. (34Calmann M.A. Nowosielska A. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6577-6579Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) except that the strain used for Redmediated recombination was GM8496, which contains the cat gene inserted between codons 820 and 821 of the mutS gene (mutS820:cat). AmpR-CamS and AmpR CamR recombinants were recovered after electroporation, which contained the mutSc chromosomal deletion or mutS820::cat, respectively, as determined by DNA sequencing. P1vir transduction was used to move the mutSC mutation into AB1157 using AmpR as the selective marker and the resultant strain was designated GM8607. ATPase Assays—Wild-type MutL or MutLLF (5 μm, as dimer) where incubated with or without a synthetic gel-purified 100-mer ssDNA oligonucleotide (6.6 μm) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 4% glycerin, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2,and 5 mm DTT. Reactions (15 μl) were supplemented with 3 mm ATP and 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 25 mm EDTA, and 0.4 μl were spotted on PEI thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates to separate ATP from ADP. TLC plates were developed with 0.6 m potassium phosphate (pH 3.4). TLC plates were dried and radioactivity was visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). DNA Gel Mobility Shift Assay—DNA containing a mismatch (heteroduplex DNA) was generated by annealing of two complementary 68-mer synthetic oligonucleotides (A: 5′-GGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTTGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCTGTTTCCTGTG-3′ and B: 5′-CACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATGATTACGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGACTCGACC-3′), which generates a G·T mismatch at position 34. Homoduplex DNA was generated using an oligonucleotide that was fully complimentary to oligonucleotide B. Reactions (15 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.6 nm 32P-labeled heteroduplex DNA, and 6 nm unlabeled homoduplex DNA and the amounts of MutS and MutSN described in the legend to Fig. 4. Reactions were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C before loading (4 μl) in a native 4% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis in TBE buffer, gels were dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Helicase Assay—The DNA substrate for helicase assays was a 90-mer DNA oligonucleotide labeled at the 5′ terminus with [32P] using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, followed by hybridization to M13mp18 ssDNA at a ratio of 1:5 (oligo:M13). The sequence of the oligonucleotide is as follows: 5′-CCCCCTTATTAGCGTTTGCCATCTTTTCATAATCAAAATCACCGGAACCAGAGCCACCACC GGAACCGCCTCCCTCAGAGCCGCCACCCT-3′. The labeled DNA substrate was present at a concentration of 1 nm in a mixture containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 40μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm MgCl2,and 3 mm ATP. The amounts of UvrD and MutL added to the reactions are indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. Reactions (15 μl) were initiated upon addition of UvrD and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched upon addition of 5 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl, 50% glycerol, and 10% SDS. Then 5 μl of each quenched reaction was loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and radioactive bands were quantitated with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Microtiter Plate Assays—N-terminal biotinylated peptides (100 pmol) were added to streptavidin-coated 96-well plates in 30 μl of PBST buffer (0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, supplemented with 0.1 (v/v) Tween 20) and incubated 1 h at 23°C. Wells were then washed three times by addition and removal of 100 μl of PBST buffer. [32P]β or human [32P]PCNA were added (90 nm) directly to wells in a volume of 30 μl and incubated for 1 h, after which each well was washed three times with 50 μl of PBST buffer. Plates were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). MutL Interacts with the β Clamp Only in the Presence of ssDNA— MutL protein is thought to act as a bridge between the site of DNA damage, recognized by MutS, and enzymes that subsequently process the DNA, like MutH endonuclease, helicases, and exonucleases (1Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 7Guarné A. Ramón-Maiques S. Wolff E.M. Ghirlando R. Hu X. Miller J.H. Yang W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4134-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of MutL indicate that it is a highly flexible molecule with two distinct regions connected by a proline-rich, 100-residue long disordered linker (7Guarné A. Ramón-Maiques S. Wolff E.M. Ghirlando R. Hu X. Miller J.H. Yang W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4134-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal domain contains a strong dimerization surface and the N-terminal domains dimerize upon ATP binding, the MutL dimer contains a very large cavity (∼100 %Aring;) that is sufficiently large to possibly accommodate 2-4 DNA helices at the same time (7Guarné A. Ramón-Maiques S. Wolff E.M. Ghirlando R. Hu X. Miller J.H. Yang W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4134-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains the ATP-binding site, and MutL is a weak ATPase that is stimulated by ssDNA; a putative ssDNA-binding site is located at the interface of two N-terminal domains as suggested by structural studies and mutational analysis (36Ban C. Junop M.S. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Upon binding to ATP, several disordered loops (L1, L2, L3, L45, and the ATP-binding region) become ordered within the N-terminal region of MutL. These loops have been suggested to be critical for the dynamic interactions that take place between the two N-terminal domains during each cycle of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and ADP release (36Ban C. Junop M.S. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that MutL in solution does not show an interaction with the β clamp (17López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Here we used an assay similar to that used initially to demonstrate the MutS-β interaction, in which β complexed with either MutS or DNA polymerase III migrates slower than free β in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In these assays the position of β on the gel is visualized using β labeled with a C-terminal tag that is specifically phosphorylated by a protein kinase (29Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using this method, an interaction between MutL and β is readily apparent in the presence of a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 1A). A titration of MutL·ssDNA into a reaction containing [32P]β indicates that they interact with a Kd value of ∼250 nm (each as dimer) (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the interaction of MutL with β may require a conformational change in MutL brought about by ssDNA binding. Next we tested the effect of the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analog, AMPPNP, on the binding of MutL to β in the presence of ssDNA (Fig. 1B). Although ATP has no apparent effect on ssDNA binding, ssDNA increases the ATPase rate of MutL, possibly by inducing dimerization of the N-terminal domains of MutL, a pre-requisite for ATP hydrolysis (36Ban C. Junop M.S. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The results show that AMPPNP decreases the affinity of MutL for β in the presence of ssDNA by ∼3-fold (Fig. 1B). AMPPNP binding to MutL causes folding of various disordered loops at the N-terminal domains of the MutL dimer (36Ban C. Junop M.S. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and therefore this result suggests that the interaction of MutL with β may be partially regulated by conformational changes in the N-terminal domains of MutL. To determine whether MutL binds to the same C-terminal face of β as MutS and other proteins, we examined the interaction by the kinase protection assay (Fig. 1C) (17López de Saro F.J. O'Donnell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8376-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 37Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The rate of phosphorylation of the 6-residue kinase tag attached to the C terminus of β was followed in the presence or absence of MutL and the ssDNA oligonucleotide. As a control, PCNA containing a kinase tag"

However, the PPIase activity targeted by active site-directed ligands remains unknown so far. Here we show that neurotrophic FKBP ligands, such as GPI1046 and N-[methyl(ethoxycarbonyl)]cycloheximide, inhibit the calmodulin/Ca(2+) (CaM/Ca(2+))-regulated FKBP38 with up to 80-fold higher affinity than FKBP12. In contrast, the non-neurotrophic rapamycin inhibits FKBP38.CaM/Ca(2+) 500-fold less affine than other neuroimmunophillins. In the context of the high expression of FKBP38 in neuroblastoma cells, these data suggest that FKBP38.CaM/Ca(2+) inhibition can mediate neurotrophic properties of FKBP ligands. The FKBP38-specific cycloheximide derivative, N-(N',N'-dimethylcarboxamidomethyl)cycloheximide (DM-CHX) was synthesized and used in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. Accordingly, DM-CHX caused neuronal protection as well as neural stem cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation at a dosage of 27.2 mug/kg. These effects were still dominant, if DM-CHX was applied 2-6 h post-insult. In parallel, sustained motor behavior deficits of diseased animals were improved by drug administration, revealing a potential therapeutic relevance. Thus, our results demonstrate that FKBP38 inhibition by DM-CHX regulates neuronal cell death and proliferation, providing a promising strategy for the treatment of acute and/or chronic neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2125218472,"Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) is a member of the insulin superfamily that plays an important role in mediating testes descent during fetal development. More recently, it has also been demonstrated to initiate oocyte maturation and suppress male germ cell apoptosis. These actions are mediated via a specific G-protein-coupled receptor, LGR8. Little is known regarding the structure and function relationship of INSL3, although it is believed that the principal receptor binding site resides within its B-chain.

Sequentially N- and C-terminally shortened linear analogs were prepared by solid phase synthesis and subsequent assay showed that the minimum length required for binding was residues 11–27. It was also observed that increased binding affinity correlated with a corresponding increase in α-helical content as measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Molecular modeling studies suggested that judicious placement of a conformational constraint within this peptide would increase its α-helix content and result in increased structural similarity to the B-chain within native INSL3. Consequently, intramolecularly disulfide-linked analogs of the B-chain showed a potentiation of INSL3 antagonistic activity, as well as exhibiting increased proteolytic stability, as assessed in rat serum in vitro. Administration of one of these peptides into the testes of rats resulted in a substantial decrease in testis weight probably due to the inhibition of germ cell survival, suggesting that INSL3 antagonists may have potential as novel contraceptive agents.

INSL3 is a 6-kDa peptide consisting of two chains (A and B) linked by two intermolecular disulfide bonds, with a third intermolecular disulfide bond in the A-chain (Fig. 1) (1Bathgate R.A.D. Hsueh A.J. Sherwood O.D. Neill J.D. Physiology of Reproduction. 3rd Ed. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., San Diego, CA2005: 679-770Google Scholar). It is expressed primarily in the Leydig cells of fetal and adult testes and in the thecal cells of the ovary (1Bathgate R.A.D. Hsueh A.J. Sherwood O.D. Neill J.D. Physiology of Reproduction. 3rd Ed. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., San Diego, CA2005: 679-770Google Scholar). The receptor for INSL3 has recently been identified and shown to belong to the family of leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) (2Kumagai J. Hsu S.Y. Matsumi H. Roh J.S. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31283-31286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). INSL3 binds with high affinity to LGR8 and has very low affinity for the paralagous receptor LGR7, which is the receptor for relaxin (3Sudo S. Kumagai J. Nishi S. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7855-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It is now well accepted that INSL3 is a member of the relaxin peptide family (4Wilkinson T.N. Speed T.P. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A.D. BMC Evol. Biol. 2005; 5: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and LGR7 and LGR8 have been classified as relaxin family peptide receptors, RXFP1 and RXFP2, respectively (5Bathgate R.A. Ivell R. Sanborn B.M. Sherwood O.D. Summers R.J. Pharmacol Rev. 2006; 58: 7-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Importantly, relaxin can bind to and activate LGR8 in some species, although with lesser affinity and potency than INSL3 (6Halls M.L. Bond C.P. Sudo S. Kumagai J. Ferraro T. Layfield S. Bathgate R.A.

In male mice, deletion of either the INSL3 (8Zimmermann S. Steding G. Emmen J.M. Brinkmann A.O. Nayernia K. Holstein A.F. Engel W. Adham I.M. Mol.

The cryptorchid phenotype, with the testis being retained in the abdomen, results in disrupted spermatogenesis and infertility. Studies have indicated that INSL3 binds and activates LGR8 in the gubernaculum to elicit an increase in cAMP production (2Kumagai J. Hsu S.Y. Matsumi H. Roh J.S. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31283-31286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and growth of the structure (11Kubota Y. Temelcos C. Bathgate R.A. Smith K.J. Scott D. Zhao C. Hutson J.M. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2002; 8: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the INSL3 gene in female mice results in descent of the ovaries into the inguinal region due to an overdeveloped gubernaculum (12Adham I.M. Steding G. Thamm T. Bullesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Paprotta I. Engel W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), consistent with the actions described above. Although female INSL3 null mice exhibit impaired fertility (9Nef S. Parada L.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), female LGR8 null mice are fertile (10Gorlov I.P. Kamat A. Bogatcheva N.V. Jones E. Lamb D.J. Truong A. Bishop C.E. McElreavey K. Agoulnik A.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2309-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), suggesting that INSL3 is involved in female fertility but that there may be redundant signaling systems involved. It has recently been demonstrated that INSL3 gene expression is increased in patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma (13Hombach-Klonisch S. Hoang-Vu C. Kehlen A. Hinze R. Holzhausen H.J. Weber E. Fischer B. Dralle H. Klonisch T. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 993-1001PubMed Google Scholar), although the significance of this is yet to be determined.In rats, the action of gonadotropin on the maturation of oocytes in the ovary and the suppression of male germ cell apoptosis in the testis has recently been shown to be mediated by INSL3 (14Kawamura K. Kumagai J. Sudo S. Chun S.Y. Pisarska M. Morita H. Toppari J. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7323-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In mammals, it is well recognized that oocyte maturation and male germ cell survival is controlled by luteinizing hormone (LH) (15Richards J.S. Russell D.L. Ochsner S. Espey L.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 16McGee E.A. Hsueh A.J. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). However, because LH does not act directly on germ cells, paracrine factors are likely to mediate its actions. It has been demonstrated that LH acts on the ovarian theca and testicular Leydig cells to produce INSL3 (14Kawamura K. Kumagai J. Sudo S. Chun S.Y. Pisarska M. Morita H. Toppari J. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7323-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This then binds to LGR8, which is expressed on germ cells to activate the inhibitory G-protein (Gi), leading to decreased cAMP production. This is in stark contrast to LGR8 in gubernacular cells, which is coupled to stimulatory Gs protein. Subsequently, in female rats INSL3 treatment was shown to initiate meiotic progression in arrested oocytes in vitro and in vivo. In males rats INSL3 treatment was found to suppress male germ cell apoptosis induced by gonadotropin withdrawal in male rats treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist in vivo. These results demonstrate that INSL3 has a potential clinical application as a specific regulator of fertility and LGR8 antagonists have the potential to be highly specific contraceptives.To date, there have been few structure-function studies for INSL3, with a paucity of information regarding the residues or regions required for specific receptor binding. Analogs of INSL3 with modifications in the B-chain at positions 25 and 27 have shown that Trp27 is essential for characteristic INSL3 activity (17Bullesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Residues B22–26 probably incorporate a type I or III β-turn that correctly positions the indole ring of Trp27 for placement into the LGR8 receptor. In particular, the steric effect of B-chain Pro25 is likely to be crucial for proper positioning of the indole moiety. Further evidence of this is provided by the recent finding that an inactive mutant of human INSL3 identified in cryptorchid patients has a B-chain Pro25 → Ser substitution (18Lim H.N. Raipert-de Meyts E. Skakkebaek N.E. Hawkins J.R. Hughes I.A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 144: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Together, these limited data indicate that an LGR8 binding site probably resides within the C terminus of the B-chain of INSL3 and specifically within residues 22–27. Given that the B-chain of INSL3 therefore most likely contains the primary binding site, we undertook to determine whether it alone possesses biological activity, and if so, how much of the B-chain is required and whether conformationally constrained analogs could be designed and prepared which would mimic the action of the native peptide.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) l-amino acid derivatives for peptide synthesis were purchased from Auspep Pty. Ltd. (Melbourne, Australia). HPLC columns were obtained from Vydac, Hesperia, CA. Synthetic human INSL3 was prepared as described previously (19Dawson N.F. Tan Y.Y. Macris M. Otvos L. Jr-Summers R.J.

J. Pept Res. 2004; 63: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and labeled with 125I by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant H2 relaxin was a gift from BAS Medical (San Mateo, CA). 33P-Labeled human gene 2 (H2) relaxin was produced as described previously (21Tan Y.Y. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. Summers R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Solvents and other chemicals were all peptide synthesis or analytical grade.Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis—Linear peptides (as the C-terminal amide) were synthesized using continuous flow Fmoc-solid phase methodology as described previously (19Dawson N.F. Tan Y.Y. Macris M. Otvos L. Jr-Summers R.J. Tregear G.W. Wade J.D. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 53: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) on Fmoc-PAL PEG-PS resin (PerSeptive Biosystems) and Fmoc-amino acids activated with 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. Nα-Fmoc deprotection was carried out with 20% piperidine in dimethyl formamide. Cleavage of the peptides from the solid support and simultaneous side chain deprotection was achieved by a 3-h treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of phenol, anisole, triisopropylsilane, and water (82.5/5/5/2.5/5, v/v). The crude peptides were purified by reversed phase (RP) HPLC on a semipreparative C18 column using a 1%/min gradient of CH3CN in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides containing cysteine residues were cyclized by intramolecular oxidation using 1 mm 2,2′-dipyridyldisulfide in H2O/MeOH/trifluoroacetic acid (89.9/10/0.1, v/v) (22Maruyama K. Nagasawa H. Suzuki A. Peptides. 1999; 20: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the reaction monitored by RP-HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, prior to purification by RP-HPLC.Peptide Characterization—The purity of each synthetic peptide was assessed by analytical RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Bruker Biflex instrument (Bremen, Germany) in the linear mode at 19.5 kV. Peptides were quantitated by amino acid analysis of a 24-h acid hydrolyzate using a GBC instrument (Melbourne, Australia).CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were measured on a Jasco J-710 (Tokyo, Japan) instrument at room temperature in a 1-mm path length cell. Peptides were made to a concentration of 0.01 μm (determined by amino acid analysis) in either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) or spectroscopy grade trifluoroethanol (TFE) (19Dawson N.F. Tan Y.Y. Macris M. Otvos L. Jr-Summers R.J. Tregear G.W. Wade J.D. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 53: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Curves were smoothed by the algorithm provided by Jasco. The CD spectra obtained were evaluated by comparing them to the spectra of known peptide conformations (23Horvat S. Otvos L. Jr-Urge L. Horvat J. Cudic M. Varga-Defterdarovic L. Spectrochim Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc. 1999; 55A: 2347-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and α-helicity was calculated according to the algorithm of Greenfield and Fasman (24Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar).Molecular Design—Using SYBYL molecular modeling software (Tripos Inc., St Louis, MO) on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station, a model of INSL3 was prepared using the x-ray crystal structure of H2 relaxin as a template (25Eigenbrot C. Randal M. Quan C. Burnier J. O'Connell L. Rinderknecht E. Kossiakoff A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 15-21PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. The H2 relaxin sequence was modified to that of INSL3, and the resultant peptide subjected to energy minimization using the Tripos forcefield and Gasteiger-Marsili charges. By examining the B-chain of the energy-minimized model, 2 residues were identified (Glu4 and Arg26) with Cβ atoms within 4.5 Å of each other. These residues were then replaced with cysteine and a disulfide bond formed to give the cyclic analog 15. The second cyclic analog (analog 14), incorporating the entire B-chain, was cyclized in the same position as in analog 15.Ligand Binding Assays—The method to study the binding of 33P-labeled H2 relaxin and 125I-INSL3 to HEK-293T cells stably transfected with either human LGR7 or LGR8 has been described previously (3Sudo S.

Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of percent specific binding of triplicate determinations made from at least three independent experiments. Data were analyzed using Graphpad PRISM (Graphpad Inc., San Diego, CA) and a non-linear regression one-site binding model was used to plot curves and calculate pKi values. Final pooled pKi data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA coupled with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test for multiple group comparison.Functional cAMP Assays—cAMP stimulation assays using HEK-293T cells stably transfected with human LGR8 were performed as described previously (26Muda M. He C. Martini P.G. Ferraro T. Layfield S. Taylor D. Chevrier C. Schweickhardt R. Kelton C. Ryan P.L. Bathgate R.A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2005; 11: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were preincubated in the presence of 0.25 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) before stimulation with INSL3 analogs in the presence or absence of 1 nm INSL3 for 30 min. Additionally, INSL3 concentration response curves were performed with various concentrations of human INSL3 in the absence or presence of 1 μm of peptides 14 or 15. At the end of the incubation, cells were lysed for measurement of cAMP in the cell lysate using a well characterized cAMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biotrak EIA, Amersham Biosciences) (27Claasz A.A. Bond C.P. Bathgate R.A. Otvos L. Dawson N.F. Summers R.J. Tregear G.W. Wade J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6287-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least three times with triplicate determinations within each assay. Results are plotted as mean ± S.E. of percent normalized response compared with 1 nm INSL3. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA coupled with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test for multiple group comparison.Serum Stability Studies—Proteolytic stability of peptides was assessed by incubating the peptide (0.7 mg/ml) at 37 °C in a 10% solution in PBS of freshly prepared rat serum (pooled from four rats). Samples (20 μl) were removed at various time points, and acetonitrile (40 μl) was added to precipitate plasma proteins, which were removed by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 3 min). The amount of intact peptide remaining in the supernatant of each sample was determined using RP-HPLC, by measuring the area under the curve of the peak at the appropriate retention time compared with a standard curve of concentration for each peptide. The half-life (t½) for each peptide is expressed as the mean of the individual half-lives determined from the single exponential curve fit for three independent experiments.Intratesticular Injections—It has been demonstrated previously that INSL3, acting through LGR8, suppresses testicular germ cell apoptosis induced by a GnRH antagonist (14Kawamura K. Kumagai J. Sudo S. Chun S.Y. Pisarska M. Morita H. Toppari J. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7323-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the INSL3 B-chain analogs on testis function in vivo, male Sprague-Dawley rats at 28 days of age were used, based on the increased expression of LGR8 at that developmental stage (14Kawamura K. Kumagai J. Sudo S. Chun S.Y. Pisarska M. Morita H. Toppari J. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7323-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The cyclic INSL3 B-chain analog 15 or the linear analog 16 (20 μg/50 μl in 71 mm acetic acid) were injected into the left testis, while the right testis remained uninjected (n = 6 and n = 3 animals, respectively). For controls (n = 6 animals), vehicle alone was injected into the left testis. The animals were sacrificed 4.5 days after the injection and the testes dissected and weighed. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. of the percentage weight of the left testis in comparison with the right testis. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA coupled with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test for multiple group comparison.RESULTSDesign and Synthesis of Linear INSL3 B-chain Analogs—To allow a study of the structure-activity requirements of the INSL3 B-chain, we prepared a series of linear B-chain analogs of varying lengths (analogs 1–13, Table 1). The full-length analog 9 consists of the sequence of the entire INSL3 B-chain (31 amino acids), except that the Cys residues at positions 10 and 22 (normally involved in formation of two disulfide bonds to the INSL3 A-chain) are replaced by Ser, to prevent unwanted disulfide formation. Analogs 1-8 are a series of N-terminally truncated analogs of the full-length peptide 9; analogs 10-13 are the corresponding C-terminally truncated peptides. Each of the B-chain analogs 1-13 were synthesized as the C-terminal amide by routine solid phase peptide synthesis methods, and purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC, in yields of 10–20% compared with the crude peptide.TABLE 1Primary sequence, pKi against 33P-relaxin and 125I-INSL3, and percent α-helix in PBS and TFE of hINSL3 and hINSL3 B-chain analogs described in this studyView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Competition Binding Studies with N- and C-terminally Truncated Linear B-chain Analogs—The ability of the linear B-chain analogs 1-13 to bind to the INSL3 receptor LGR8 was assessed in competition binding studies with 33P-relaxin and 125I-INSL3, using HEK-293T modified to stably express LGR8 (Table 1, Fig. 2). As reported previously (3Sudo S. Kumagai J. Nishi S. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7855-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), INSL3 potently displaced 33P-relaxin from these cells, with a pKi of 9.6 ± 0.17. Surprisingly, INSL3 B-chain analogs were able to displace 33P-relaxin binding from LGR8 expressing cells although their affinity was 104-fold less than native INSL3. Hence the full-length linear B-chain analog 9 demonstrated a pKi of 5.64 ± 0.12 (Table 1, Fig. 2, A–D). Removal of 2 (analog 8, Fig.2 A), 5 (analog 7), or 8 (analog 6, Fig. 2A) residues from the N terminus had limited effect on the ability of the compounds to compete with 33P-relaxin at LGR8 compared with the full-length analog 9. However, analog 5, shortened N-terminally by a further 3 residues, showed significantly reduced affinity (p < 0.01), while removal of 3 more residues gave analog 4, which displayed only partial displacement (Fig. 2B). Further N-terminal shortening (i.e. analogs 1-3) effectively abolished the ability of the compounds to displace 33P-relaxin (Fig. 2B). C-terminal truncation by 1–4 residues (analogs 10-13) appeared to have no effect on the ability of linear B-chain analogs to displace 33P-relaxin (Fig. 2C). Similar pKi values were obtained for selected compounds when the alternative LGR8 radioligand 125I-INSL3 was used (i.e. INSL3 pKi = 9.58 ± 0.07; see analogs 8 and 3, Table 1 and Fig. 2F). None of the linear B-chain analogs 1–13 were found to bind to LGR7 (data not shown).FIGURE 2Competition binding studies of INSL3 and selected INSL3 B-chain analogs. Binding studies were carried out in HEK-293T cells stably transfected with LGR8, using either 33P-relaxin (A–E)or 125I-INSL3 (F) as the radioligand.

In contrast, none of the linear INSL3 B-chain analogs 1-13 were able to promote cAMP production in LGR8 stably transfected HEK-293T alone (data not shown). However, when assayed in competition with INSL3, many of the linear B-chain analogs 1-13 were found to inhibit INSL3-mediated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3, A and B). In general, the data obtained reflected the binding of the compounds to LGR8. When added to cells at a concentration of 10 μm in competition with INSL3 (1 nm), the full-length B-chain analog 9 gave a 25% inhibition of cAMP accumulation. Progressive N-terminal truncation steadily reduced the extent of inhibition, such that the shortest analogs 1-4 were unable to inhibit INSL3-mediated cAMP formation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the C-terminally truncated analogs 10-13 showed similar inhibition to the full-length analog 9 (Fig. 3B). Similar inhibitory actions were observed when H2 relaxin was used as the stimulus for cAMP production (data not shown).FIGURE 3Effects of INSL3 B-chain analogs on INSL3-mediated cAMP production. HEK-293T cells stably transfected with LGR8 were treated with vehicle (–), 1 nm INSL3 alone (+), or 1 nm INSL3 + 10 μm B-chain analog 1–15 as indicated and cAMP measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

We have previously shown that decorin is dimeric both in solution and in crystal structures. In this study we determined whether biglycan dimerizes and investigated the role of dimerization in the folding and stability of these proteoglycans. We used light scattering to show that biglycan is dimeric in solution and solved the crystal structure of the glycoprotein core of biglycan at 3.40-Å resolution. This structure reveals that biglycan dimerizes in the same way as decorin, i.e. by apposition of the concave inner surfaces of the leucine-rich repeat domains. We demonstrate that low concentrations of guanidinium chloride denature biglycan and decorin but that the denaturation is completely reversible following removal of the guanidinium chloride, as assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Furthermore, the rate of refolding is dependent on protein concentration, demonstrating that it is not a unimolecular process. Upon heating, decorin shows a single structural transition at a Tm of 45-46 °C but refolds completely upon cooling to 25 °C. This property of decorin enabled us to show both by calorimetry and light scattering that dimer to monomer transition coincided with unfolding and monomer to dimer transition coincided with refolding; thus these processes are inextricably linked. We further conclude that folded monomeric biglycan or decorin cannot exist in solution.

Matrix. 1989; 9: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or to bind less strongly (20Schonherr E. Witsch-Prehm P. Harrach B. Robenek H. Rauterberg J. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2776-2783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of decorin and biglycan include 12 tandem LRRs averaging 24 residues long (21Matsushima N. Ohyanagi T. Tanaka T. Kretsinger R.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 38: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). LRRs are present in many intracellular, cell-surface, and extracellular proteins and consist of a strongly conserved core of 11 residues (LXXLXLXXNXI), flanked by more variable sequences (22Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). The LRR domains of the SLRPs are flanked by clusters of cysteines, four on the N-terminal side and two (usually) on the C-terminal side. These cysteines form disulfides that have been shown to be required for the biological activity of decorin (23Scott P.G. Winterbottom N. Dodd C.M. Edwards E. Pearson C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and fibromodulin (16Scott P.G. Nakano T. Dodd C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), because reduction abolishes collagen binding. We have previously shown that decorin and the Class III SLRP opticin form stable dimers in solution and that this dimerization is mediated through interactions between the LRR domains (24Scott P.G.

The decorin dimerization data were initially criticized on the grounds that the proteoglycan had been lyophilized during purification and that this could have caused nonspecific aggregation (26Goldoni S. Owens R.T. McQuillan D.J. Shriver Z. Sasisekharan R. Dirk D.E. Campbell S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but we subsequently showed that recombinant decorin that had neither been lyophilized nor exposed to denaturant was entirely dimeric (27Scott P.G. McEwan P.A. Dodd C.M. Bergmann E.M. Bishop P.N. Bella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15633-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We also solved the crystal structures of both tissue-extracted and recombinant decorin, which showed them to be virtually identical, demonstrating dimerization through highly specific interactions between the concave surfaces of the apposed LRR domains (27Scott P.G. McEwan P.A. Dodd C.M. Bergmann E.M. Bishop P.N. Bella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15633-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Here we show that biglycan forms stable dimers in solution and present the biglycan structure obtained by x-ray crystallography. Moreover, we provide strong evidence that dimerization is essential for the folding and structural stability of both decorin and biglycan. Proteoglycans—Bovine skin decorin and bovine articular cartilage biglycan were isolated and purified as described (24Scott P.G. Grossmann J.G. Dodd C.M. Sheehan J.K. Bishop P.N. J. Biol.

The purified proteoglycans and their glycoprotein cores produced by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4, Seikagaku) or by chondroitin ABC lyase followed by N-glycosidase F (EC 3.2.2.18, Roche Applied Science) (12Scott P.G.

Kumin S. Skeletal Research: An Experimental Approach. Academic Press, New York1979: 227-241Google Scholar). The protein cores of both proteoglycan preparations used here were sequenced in their entireties by Edman degradation (10Scott P.G. Scott J.E.

Crystallization of Biglycan—Biglycan was digested with chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4, Seikagaku) at 37 °C for 3 h to removethe glycosaminoglycan chains (24Scott P.G. Grossmann J.G. Dodd C.M.

Guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl, 2.5 m) was added to the digestion mixture, and the core glycoprotein was then isolated by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6™ HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with 2.5 m GdnHCl in 0.02 m Tris-HCl/0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.0 (TBS). To the pooled fractions was added sodium azide, EDTA, and Zwittergent 3-14 (Calbiochem) to final concentrations of 0.02% (w/v), 5 mm and 0.01% (w/v), respectively. Protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 5.4 mg/ml, as measured by the BCA protein assay (31Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K.

Refolding was assessed by CD spectroscopy, and the solution molar mass of the protein was measured by size-exclusion chromatography/multiangle laser light scattering (24Scott P.G. Grossmann J.G. Dodd C.M. Sheehan J.K. Bishop P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18353-18359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Aliquots of refolded protein were diluted to 2.7 mg/ml in 0.4 mm Zwittergent 3-14/0.02% (w/v) NaN3, pH 7.5. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in hanging drops consisting of 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of 0.2 m triammonium citrate/polyethylene glycol 3350 (20% v/v), pH 7.0, set up at 20 °C over 1 ml of the same solution. Triangular plate-like crystals, ∼150 μm on edge and 15 μm thick, appearing after 2 months, were flash-cooled to 90 K in cryoprotectant consisting of 30% (w/v) D(-) glucose in well solution. Reflections were indexed in the space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 206.511 Å, b = 110.222 Å, c = 140.625 Å, α = 90°, β = 116.61°, γ = 90° and six biglycan monomers per asymmetric unit (Vm = 3.45 Å3/Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 64.32%). Data Collection and Processing—Data were collected at beamline 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA. The data were processed and scaled using the programs Mosflm, SCALA, and TRUNCATE, from the CCP4 program suite, run under the control of the Elves_1.2 automation scripts (32Holton J. Alber T. Proc.

The model was rebuilt into solvent-flattened electron density maps calculated using RESOLVE in “prime-and-switch” mode (34Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1763-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and simulated annealing composite omit maps were calculated using the Crystallography and NMR System software package (CNS), version 1.1 (35Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kuntsleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L.

Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) was used to display maps and to build/rebuild models. Refinement to 3.4 Å was performed using simulated annealing in CNS to convergence (Rcryst = 30.4% and Rfree = 33.9%). Final refinement was carried out using REFMAC5.2 (37Murshudov G.N. Vagin A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). Tight NCS restraints were applied during refinement in both CNS and REFMAC5. The final model (Rcryst = 25.9% and Rfree = 29.1%; Table 2) is composed of amino acid residues 25-327 of chains A, B, C and E, residues 25-328 of chain D, residues 25-329 of chain F, 6 N-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues, and 6 citrate anions.

The actual concentrations were determined by the BCA assay. CD spectra were recorded between 190 and 250 nm on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Denaturation curves were recorded by continuously monitoring the ellipticities at 205 nm or 217 nm in Jasco J-20 or J-720 spectropolarimeters. Thermostatted cells of 0.01-, 0.02-, 0.1-, and 1-cm path length were used for these experiments. Raw data were converted to mean residue ellipticities using mean residue weights of 110.3 for decorin and 112.2 for biglycan, respectively, calculated from their amino acid sequences. The kinetics of refolding of GdnHCl-denatured proteoglycans were followed by diluting aliquots of 2.5 m GdnHCl solutions into TBS and recording CD spectra at 2-min (for decorin) or 10-min (for biglycan) intervals, from 250 to 205 nm at a scan rate of 50 nm/min, starting 30 s after dilution. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Weighed samples of decorin were dissolved at ∼1 mg/ml in 0.15 m NaCl/0.02 m Tris-HCl/0.02% (w/v) NaN3, pH 7.0. Solutions were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 250 volumes of buffer, filtered through 0.45-μm membrane filters (Sartorius) and degassed for 10 min with stirring under vacuum. The actual concentrations of protein in these solutions were determined by the BCA assay. A differential scanning microcalorimeter (VP-DSC, MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) was used in passive (i.e. no feedback) mode with a filter period of 16 s. Reference scans were performed first with both cells filled with sample dialysate. Following a pre-scan equilibration period of 15 min, the temperature was increased linearly from 25 to 60 °C at a rate of 0.5 °/min, followed by immediate cooling. Once a reproducible baseline had been obtained, the buffer in the sample cell was replaced with the solution of proteoglycan. The scan rate of 0.5 °/min was selected to give results for the Tm of decorin measured during an up-scan and the subsequent down-scan at the same rate, differing by <0.5 °C. To test for refolding of the denatured protein, up-scans were repeated with intermediate cooling at the default maximum rate (∼5 °/min). Data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin™ software. Excess heat capacity curves obtained with buffer alone were subtracted from those obtained for decorin solutions. Gel Chromatography and Light Scattering—Samples dissolved in TBS/0.02% (w/v) sodium azide were chromatographed on a Superose™ 6 HR 10/30 column eluted with the same buffer. The effluent from this column was led through multiangle laser light scattering (DAWN-F) and refractive index (Optilab 903) detectors (Wyatt Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA). ASTRA version 2 software was used to process data. A value for dn/dc of 0.14 was used for biglycan, calculated from the values of 0.15 and 0.12 previously determined for decorin and dermatan sulfate, respectively (38Zangrando D.W. Gupta R. Jamieson A.M. Blackwell J. Scott P.G. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), taking into account the higher proportion of GAG in biglycan. To monitor the effect of temperature on the molecular weight, the buffer pump was stopped just after the material in the main decorin (dimer) peak had entered the light scattering and refractive index detectors, which were initially at 25 °C. The temperature was then increased at a rate of 2 °C/min, held at 60 °C for 5 min and then decreased at a rate of 2 °/min. After a further 8 min at 25 °C, buffer flow was resumed. Fig. 1 shows a comparison by SDS-PAGE of the two proteoglycans and their core proteins. Intact biglycan migrates more slowly than decorin, but after removal of the GAG chains by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase (lanes 2 and 5), its glycoprotein core migrates slightly faster than that of decorin. This behavior is consistent with the presence of two N-linked oligosaccharides on biglycan, compared with the three on decorin. The mobilities of the bands generated after further digestion with N-glycosidase F to remove these oligosaccharides (lanes 3 and 6) were indistinguishable. For crystallization of biglycan, as for decorin (27Scott P.G. McEwan P.A. Dodd C.M. Bergmann E.M. Bishop P.N. Bella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15633-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), only the GAG chains were removed, because we had found previously that removal of N-linked oligosaccharides leads to nonspecific aggregation and decreased solubility of the core protein of decorin (12Scott P.G. Dodd C.M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1990; 24: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit of the biglycan crystal consists of six monomers organized as three antiparallel dimers, one of which is illustrated in Fig. 2. The dimer interface in biglycan buries a somewhat larger surface area than that in decorin (2550 Å2 compared with 2300 Å2). Similar to the structure that we recently solved for decorin (27Scott P.G. McEwan P.A. Dodd C.M. Bergmann E.M. Bishop P.N. Bella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15633-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the biglycan monomer consists mainly of a right-handed spiral of 12 leucine-rich repeats, each of which comprises a short β-strand linked by loops, strands, and short helical segments (Fig. 2A). The β-sheet forming the inner concave face of the arch-shaped biglycan monomer begins with an anti-parallel hairpin stabilized by two disulfides. A third disulfide (between residues 285 and 318) connects LRRs 11 and 12 and stabilizes a loop that we have termed the “ear.” The Cα atoms of the biglycan and decorin monomers can be superimposed with an average r.m.s.d. of 2.9 Å and the dimers (Fig. 2B) with an r.m.s.d. of 3.2 Å. The β-sheet face of the biglycan monomer is more tightly curved than in decorin. The near N-terminal cystine-knot arrangement of disulfides in biglycan, connecting Cys-27 to Cys-33 and Cys-31 to Cys-40 (Fig. 2C), is identical to that in decorin. This disagrees with an earlier conclusion that Cys-27 was connected to Cys-40, based on sequence analysis (30Neame P.J. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8653-8661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No electron density was observed for residues 1-24 or for residue 330 in any of the 6 molecules of biglycan in the asymmetric unit. These sequences were also unobserved in the crystal structure of decorin (27Scott P.G. McEwan P.A. Dodd C.M. Bergmann E.M. Bishop P.N. Bella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15633-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and are assumed to be conformationally flexible. At an early stage in the fitting of maps, strong electron density that could not be accounted for in terms of the known amino acid sequence, was observed near to the N terminus of each biglycan monomer. This density was contained within a pocket formed mainly by residues His-202, His-226, His-247, and Asp-249 of one protomer, partially closed off from solvent by residues Leu-43, Leu-45, and Lys-46 of the second protomer. It was initially thought that this electron density might be due to zinc, in view of reports that biglycan can bind this cation (39Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.-H. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28366-28373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, potential electron donor atoms within the pocket are too far away from the putative metal ion for coordination. The position, discrete nature, and shape of this electron density are also inconsistent with a covalently attached sugar residue. A single citrate ion, most probably derived from the crystallization solution, was eventually fitted at each location (Fig. 2D). Comparison between native and GdnHCl (2.5 m) denatured decorin and biglycan (Fig. 3) shows that denaturation results in complete abolition of the negative Cotton effect near 217 nm. Changes in CD reflect alterations only in the secondary structures of the protein cores, because the GAG chains and N-linked oligosaccharides contribute little to the spectra (23Scott P.G. Winterbottom N. Dodd C.M. Edwards E. Pearson C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Panels A and B in Fig. 4 show denaturation curves measured for the two proteoglycans by monitoring the ellipticity at 217 nm as a function of the concentration of GdnHCl. From plots of ΔG versus concentration of denaturant over the approximately linear portions of the curves (panels C and D) (40Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar), the net stabilities at 25 °C in the absence of denaturant are estimated to be -1.57 ± 0.04 and -1.92 ± 0.16 kcal.mol-1, for decorin and biglycan, respectively. The concentrations of GdnHCl giving 50% denaturation are 0.753 ± 0.008 and 0.954 ± 0.154 m, and the slopes are 2.081 ± 0.033 and 1.693 ± 0.146 kcal.mol-1.m-1, respectively. Samples of decorin and biglycan that had been dissolved in 2.5 m GdnHCl and then dialyzed against buffer overnight at 4 °C gave CD spectra that were indistinguishable from those shown in Fig. 3 for the native proteoglycans. Denaturation by GdnHCl is therefore completely reversible. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to investigate the kinetics of refolding following dilution of 2.5 m GdnHCl solutions into TBS. At a concentration of 2.92 μm denatured decorin (Fig. 5A) refolded completely within 2 min. At higher dilution (0.77 μm), refolding was slower. Biglycan (Fig. 5B) refolded more slowly than decorin: at a concentration of 2.57 μm, refolding appeared to be complete by ∼40 min. As seen for decorin, refolding of biglycan was slower at lower concentrations. Proteoglycans at concentrations intermediate between those shown refolded at intermediate rates (data not shown). Therefore, the rate of refolding of both the decorin and biglycan was concentration-dependent. Light scattering was used to measure the molecular weights of"

Using a proteomics approach, we identified two genes (ttuA and ttuB; tRNA-two-thiouridine) that are essential for the synthesis of s2T in Thermus thermophilus. Mutation of either gene completely abolishes thio-modification of s2T, and these mutants exhibit a temperature-sensitive phenotype. These results suggest that bacterial growth at higher temperatures is achieved through the thermal stabilization of tRNA by a 2-thiolation modification.

The 2-thiolation content of rT54 increases with cultivation temperature; in T. thermophilus cells grown at ≥80 °C, more than half of the tRNAs contain s2T54, whereas at 50 °C only a small proportion were thiolated at this position. Additionally, the melting temperature of tRNA increases concomitantly with s2T incorporation (1Watanabe K. Shinma M. Oshima T. Nishimura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In an in vitro translation assay, 2-thiolated tRNA functions more efficiently at higher temperatures, whereas unthiolated tRNA functions optimally at lower temperatures (3Yokoyama S. Watanabe K. Miyazawa T. Adv. Biophys. 1987; 23: 115-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the proportion of tRNA containing s2T54 is a key factor in the adaptation of the thermophilic translation system to varying environmental temperatures. NMR analysis has elucidated the mechanism by which 2-thiolation of rT54 effects the thermal stabilization of tRNA (4Watanabe K. Yokoyama S. Hansske F. Kasai H. Miyazawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). s2T adopts the C3′-endo-gg-anti conformation, as do all residues in A-form RNA, due to steric effects between the bulky 2-thiocarbonyl group and the 2′-hydroxyl group. The inherent rigidity of s2T54 stabilizes the interaction between the D and T loops of tRNA, resulting in thermostability of the tertiary structure (3Yokoyama S. Watanabe K. Miyazawa T. Adv. Biophys. 1987; 23: 115-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although the function of s2T has been studied extensively, information on the biosynthesis of the 2-thiocarbonyl group of s2T is limited. In previous work, we undertook a preliminary characterization of the 2-thiolation reaction in a cell-free extract of T. thermophilus and found that a sulfur atom from cysteine or sulfate was incorporated into s2T (5Shigi N. Suzuki T. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2104-2113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The aims of this study were to isolate novel tRNA-binding proteins involved in the s2T modification of tRNA in T. thermophilus, to confirm their activity through mutation and in vitro analyses, and to determine whether or not the s2T modification of tRNA is required for growth at elevated temperatures. Strains—The strains used for this study were wild-type T. thermophilus HB27 and T. thermophilus NS0801, which lacks the gene for 4-thiouridine (s4U) biosynthesis (thiI) (5Shigi N. Suzuki T. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2104-2113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both wild-type and mutant strains were cultivated in rich medium (6Takada T. Akanuma S. Kotsuka T. Tamakoshi M. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 2737-2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 70 °C without or with 30 μg/ml kanamycin, respectively, unless otherwise stated. Escherichia coli JM109 (7Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) and TOP10 (Invitrogen) were used as hosts for the genetic manipulation of plasmids. Preparation of tRNA-bound Resin—The template for the in vitro transcription of tRNAIle was constructed using PCR to amplify the tRNA sequence under control of the T7 promoter (8Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for the construction of a plasmid bearing the tRNAIle gene are ile-temp-F (5′-ggccgaattc taatacgact cactataggg cgattagctc agctggttag agcgcacgcc tgataagcgt gag-3′) and ile-temp-R (5′-cgcgcaagct tggatggaag acctggtggg cgatggtgga cttgaaccac cgacctcacg cttatcagg-3′). The PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pUC19. For in vitro transcription, the pair of primers ile-F (5′-taatacgact cactataggg cg-3′)/ile-R (5′-tggtgggcga tggtggactt g-3′) was employed to PCR-amplify the template plasmid pUC19-tRNAIle. Transcription of the tRNA gene was conducted at 37 °C for 3 h in a reaction mixture containing 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm spermidine, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm each NTP, 5 mm GMP, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/ml template DNA, and T7 RNA polymerase (8Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). In order to prepare tRNA-bound resin, the 3′-ribose of the tRNA was oxidized to form a dialdehyde at room temperature, for 1 h in the dark, in a buffer containing 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 10 mm sodium periodate, and 10 mm MgCl2. The oxidized tRNA was purified using a NAP 5 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and recovered by ethanol precipitation. Oxidized tRNA was biotinylated using Biotin (Long Arm) hydrazide (Vector), incubated in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 10 mm MgCl2, at room temperature overnight in the dark. Unreacted biotin was removed by gel filtration using a NAP 5 column, followed by ethanol precipitation of the biotinylated tRNA. The precipitate was resuspended in H buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and mixed with Streptavidin-Sepharose HP (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The excess tRNA (unbound fraction) was removed from the resin by washing three times with H buffer. About 35 μg of tRNA was immobilized on 10 μl of Streptavidin-Sepharose HP. Purification and Identification of tRNA-binding Proteins—A cell extract was prepared from an early log phase T. thermophilus HB27 culture. Cells were resuspended in H buffer with 10 mm KCl and then sonicated at 4 °C and centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h, after which the supernatant was again collected and subjected to desalting using a Nap 25 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). About 30 mg of gel-filtrated S100 was obtained from a 1-liter culture of T. thermophilus HB27 (∼1.4 g of cells). In order to remove nonspecific binding proteins, the desalted S100 fraction (2.5 mg) was mixed with Streptavidin-Sepharose HP and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, after which the resin was removed. The resultant fraction was then applied to tRNA-Sepharose (∼50 μg of bound tRNAIle) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min, followed by washing three times with H buffer. The resin-bound protein was mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.7 m 2-mercapthoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, prior to separation using SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and bands of interest were excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion as described previously (9Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). Tryptic digests were analyzed using nanoflow-HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. This consisted of a DiNa splitless nanoflow HPLC system (KYA Technologies) and a 50 × 0.15-mm inner diameter packed ODS (3-μm particle size) capillary column (KYA Technologies), which are used for efficient separation of small amounts of peptide. Tryptic digest fragments were separated in 0.1% formic acid in water, using a linear gradient from 0 to 100% of 70% acetonitrile for 40 min at a flow rate of 500 nl/min. Ionization of the eluted peptides was performed using LCQ ion trap mass spectrometry (Thermo Electron), through electrospray ionization (metal nanosprayer S; GL Sciences). Proteins were identified using the MASCOT data base search engine (Matrix Science) and compared with the T. thermophilus HB27 genome data base (NC_005835 and NC_005838 on NCBI). Construction of ttuA::km and ttuB::km Strains—To construct the mutant strains ttuA::km (ttc0106::km) and ttuB::km (ttc0105::km) (NS2710 and NS2720, respectively), we PCR-amplified 0.5 kb from the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of both target open reading frames (ORFs), using the T. thermophilus HB27 genome as a template. The htk cassette (kanamycin resistance gene) was amplified from pUC18-pJHK3 (10Hoseki J. Yano T. Koyama Y. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These fragments were designed with complementary sequences, enabling the 5′-flanking region, htk, and the 3′-flanking region to be ligated by PCR. The pairs of oligonucleotides used were as follows: ttc0106-5′-F (5′-ccgaggggtg gcttaggacc-3′)/ttc0106-5′-R (5′-gtaccatatc cgccgtcata tcagccctct ccgtctcctt gac-3′), ttc0106-3′-F (5′-gttaatcatg ttggttacgc atgtgggacg ccgtctacc-3)/ttc0106-3′-R (5′-gggtccacgt cgcagtagtc-3′), ttc0105-5′-F (5′-gacgtcctcg tggtccaggc-3′)/ttc0105-5′-R (5′-gtaccatatc cgccgtcata tcatctccgg gttcaggcca agc-3′), ttc0105-3′-F (5′-gttaatcatg ttggttacgt gcggggcgag gagctcctc-3′)/ttc0105-3′-R (5′-gtagcgcttg gagaggccgc-3′), and htk-F (5′-tgatatgacg gcggatatgg tac-3′)/htk-R (5′-cgtaaccaac atgattaac-3′). The sequences complementary to the htk gene cassette are underlined. The PCR fragments containing the htk cassette insertion were cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Using the plasmids prepared as described above, T. thermophilus HB27 was transformed as previously described (11Koyama Y. Hoshino T. Tomizuka N. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 338-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on rich medium containing 300 μg/ml kanamycin. Homologous recombination was confirmed using PCR amplification, followed by restriction digestion analysis. Analysis of tRNA Modification—Cells were grown at 70 °C to late log phase, and total RNA was extracted using Isogen (Wako). The tRNA fraction was further purified using 10% PAGE containing 7 m urea. Total tRNA was digested by nuclease P1 (Yamasa) and bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Takara) in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), at 37 °C for 10 h. The hydrolysate of RNA was analyzed using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS), as described previously (12Kaneko T. Suzuki T. Kapushoc S.T. Rubio M.A. Ghazvini J. Watanabe K. Simpson L. Suzuki T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Temperature-dependent Growth Phenotypes of ttuA and ttuB Strains— Cells were cultivated in the rich medium (30 μg/ml kanamycin was added to the mutant strains) at 70 °C overnight. Diluted culture (A600 = 0.1) and serial dilutions (10-1, 10-2, 10-3, and 10-4) were spotted onto rich medium plates and incubated for 31 h at 60 °C, 17 h at 70 °C, 15 h at 75 °C, 24 h at 80 °C, and 32 h at 82 °C. Overexpression and Purification of TtuA, TtuB, IscS, and SufS Proteins— The gene encoding TtuA (TTC0106) of T. thermophilus HB27 was cloned into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET22b(+) (Novagene), resulting in a C-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein. The oligonucleotides used were TTC0106-Nde-F (5′-agccagctCA TATGgtctgc aaggtctgcg ggc-3′) and TTC0106-Hin-R (5′-gagctAAGCT Taccggcacg gaggggcttc-3′). The sequences for restriction sites are shown in capital letters. The genes encoding TtuB (TTC0105), IscS (TTC0087), and SufS (TTC1373) of T. thermophilus HB27 were cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b (Novagene), resulting in N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins. The pairs of oligonucleotides used were TTC0105-Nde-F (5′-agccagctCA TATGagggtc gttctgcgcc-3′)/TTC0105-Bam-R (5′-ggcatGGATC Ctaccctccc gagatggc-3′), TTC0087-Nde-F (5′-agccagctCA TATGcggggc gtctacctgg actacgc-3′)/TTC0087-Bgl-R (5′-ggcatAGATC Tcaagcccgg gcccgggcca cggcc-3′), and TTC1373-Nde-F (5′-agccagctCA TATGgaccta agcgccctga gggaggac-3′)/TTC1373-Bam-R (5′-ggcatGGATC Cttatagcca ggcccggtac ttggcctc-3′), respectively. pETDuet-1 (Novagene) was used for the co-expression of the untagged TtuA and N-His6-TtuB. The NcoI-BamHI fragment of pET15b-TtuB (N-His6-TtuB) was inserted in the same restriction sites of pET-Duet-1, and ttuA was cloned into the NdeI and BglII sites. The pair of oligonucleotides used is TTC0106-Nde-F (see above) and TTC0106-Bgl-R (5′-gagctAGATC Ttaaccggca cggaggggct tc-3′). E. coli Rosetta (DE3) (Novagene) was transformed with the expression plasmids described above. Cultures were grown to A600 = 0.6, induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm for TtuA, 1 mm for TtuB, 0.01 mm for co-expression of TtuA/B, and 0.1 mm for IscS and SufS), and expressed for a further 4 h at 37 °C. Cells expressing recombinant His-tagged TtuB, IscS, and SufS were harvested, suspended in K100 buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) with 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and gently sonicated. Lysates were separated using centrifugation at 6,000 × g, and the supernatants were collected and heat-treated at 70 °C for 15 min. A second centrifugation at 6,000 × g was performed, and the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column, washed with K100 buffer containing 1 m NH4Cl and 10 mm imidazole, and eluted with K100 buffer with 250 mm imidazole. Purified proteins were desalted using a NAP 25 gel filtration column and K100 buffer. Protein-containing fractions were concentrated with Centricon columns (YM3 for TtuB and YM30 for IscS and SufS; Millipore Corp.). The His-tagged fusion protein TtuA and the co-expressed TtuA/TtuB were purified as above, except for the addition of 500 mm KCl to all buffers and 200 mm imidazole to the buffer for gel filtration of TtuA in order to prevent precipitation. Centricon columns YM10 and YM3 were used for concentration of TtuA and TtuA/TtuB, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with a bovine serum albumin standard. Glycerol was added to the purified protein solutions to a final concentration of 30%, and each sample was stored at -30 °C. 2-Thiolation Assay with Recombinant Proteins—tRNAPhe from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sigma) was dephosphorylated using bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Takara), and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo) was used to label the 5′ terminus with [γ-32P]ATP (110 TBq mmol-1; Amersham Biosciences), followed by purification with denaturing 10% PAGE. The 2-thiolation assays were performed at 60 °C for 20 min in 20 μlof H buffer containing 5 mm ATP, 1 mm cysteine, 20 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, 5′-labeled tRNAPhe (∼50,000 cpm/∼10 ng), 100 μg of desalted S100 (from the NS0801 strain that had been grown at 80 °C), and 30 pmol of the recombinant proteins. tRNA was recovered using Isogen (Wako), ethanol-precipitated, and separated using [(N-acryloylamino)phenyl]mercuric chloride (APM)-containing PAGE (100 μm APM) (13Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Shigi N. Suzuki T. Tamakoshi M. Oshima T. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39128-39135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Gels were exposed to an imaging plate, followed by analysis using a BAS1000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Systems). The 2-thiolation reaction with [35S]cysteine was performed as described above with the following modifications. Four μg of S. cerevisiae tRNAPhe and 20 μm [35S]cysteine (20 μCi) were added to 20 μl of reaction mixture. [35S]cysteine was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. RNAs were recovered using Isogen reagent and ethanol-precipitated. For alkaline treatment, the RNA sample was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 9.0). The sample was then subjected to 10% PAGE using gels containing 7 m urea, and the gels were then stained with EtBr. The gel was dried, exposed to an imaging plate, and analyzed using a BAS 1000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Systems). For nucleoside analysis, labeled tRNAPhe was purified by PAGE, and 35S-labeled nucleosides were analyzed by an HPLC system as essentially described in the literature (5Shigi N. Suzuki T. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2104-2113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fractions, which were collected every 37.8 s, were measured for absorbance at 280 nm and radioactivity. Purification of tRNA-binding Proteins from T. thermophilus Cell Extract—In order to identify the gene encoding the protein responsible for tRNA thiolation, we isolated the tRNA-binding proteins from a cell extract of T. thermophilus and identified the corresponding genes using proteomics. Transcript tRNAIle was biotinylated with ∼90% efficiency (data not shown) and immobilized on a streptavidin-Sepharose resin. The immobilized tRNAIle was used for the affinity purification of tRNA-binding proteins from a cell extract of T. thermophilus (Fig. 1). Samples were separated using a gradient SDS-PAGE. When compared, the sample that was affinity-purified with tRNA-Sepharose (lane 3) exhibited a different pattern from that of the cell extract prior to purification (lane 1), and little nonspecific binding to the resin alone was observed (lane 2). This suggests that tRNA-binding proteins were purified successfully. The major protein bands in lane 3 were excised and analyzed using mass spectrometry. A total of 108 proteins were identified from 2,204 ORFs of T. thermophilus HB27. Of these, ∼40% were predicted to interact with RNA (tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA); the remainder comprised DNA-binding proteins, biotin-binding proteins, metabolic pathway proteins, and proteins of unknown function. Among the RNA-binding proteins identified, we found 14 tRNA-binding proteins; tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (CCA-adding enzyme), elongation factor Tu, Ile-tRNA-synthetase, peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, and 10 tRNA-modifying enzymes (Fig. 1B). We used the tRNAIle species for the purification experiment, since native tRNAIle has eight posttranscriptional modifications (15Horie N. Hara-Yokoyama M. Yokoyama S. Watanabe K. Kuchino Y. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5711-5715Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar): 4-thiouridine at position 8 (s4U8); 2′-O-methylguanosine at position 18 (Gm18); dihydrouridine at position 20a (D20a); 6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 (t6A37); 7-methylguanosine at position 46 (m7G46); s2T54; pseudouridine at position 55 (Ψ55); and 1-methyladenosine at position 58 (m1A58). With the exception of the enzymes for 2-thiolation of s2T and 6-threonylation of t6A, all of the other enzymes responsible for the modification of tRNAIle have been identified (i.e. ThiI for s4U8 (16Mueller E.G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2148-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)). Additionally, enzymes that are not involved in modification of tRNAIle were identified, such as TruD for Ψ13 (23Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA. 2003; 9: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), MiaA for 6-isopentenyladenosine at position 37 (i6A37) (24Dihanich M.E. Najarian D. Clark R. Gillman E.C. Martin N.C. Hopper A.K.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2255-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering these results, enrichment of modification enzymes from the cell extract turned out to have been very efficiently achieved by our strategy. Identification of the Genes Essential for the 2-Thiouridylation Reaction— Among the proteins in the affinity-purified sample, we identified one belonging to the TtcA family (TTC0106) (Figs. 1A, 2A, and 3A). This protein family includes TtcA, an enzyme that is responsible for the biosynthesis of 2-thiocytidine (s2C) at position 32 of tRNA (26Jäger G. Leipuviene R. Pollard M.G. Qian Q. Björk G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 750-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of TTC0106 indicates that it is more closely related to the Group II TtcA family of proteins. These proteins possess a P-loop motif (Ser-Gly-Gly-Xaa-Asp-(Ser/Thr)) and four or five Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys (CXXC) motifs. In contrast, TtcA from Escherichia coli is included in Group I, which possess a P-loop motif and two CXXC motifs. The P-loop motif specifically binds ATP to form an adenylated intermediate; other tRNA-modifying enzymes, such as MnmA, ThiI, and TilS, also possess this motif (27Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2424-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Soma A.

By the analysis of tRNA modification using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS), we were unable to detect s2C in the tRNA mixture of T. thermophilus under similar conditions to those required for detection of s2C from E. coli (data not shown). Thus, we believe that TTC0106 is not involved in s2C biosynthesis but is a candidate for s2T biosynthesis.FIGURE 3Multiple sequence alignments of TTC0106 (TtuA) (A) and TTC0105 (TtuB) (B) from various organisms.

It is a paralog of ThiS, a sulfur carrier protein essential for biosynthesis of the sulfur-containing cofactor, thiamine (30Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. Kinsland C. Chiu H.J. Costello C.A.

Multiple alignment of TTC0105 and related sequences indicates that these proteins possess a conserved C-terminal Gly-Gly motif (Fig. 3B). The C terminus of ThiS is thiocarboxylated with a sulfur atom from cysteine, and then the sulfur atom is incorporated into the thiamine precursor (31Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol.

TTC0316 appears to be an ortholog of ThiS, and not only does the sequence closely resemble ThiS from E. coli (Fig. 3B), but in the T. thermophilus genome, it is located in a thiamine biosynthesis operon (ThiESGOC, unknown ORF, and ThiD; TTC0315-0321). The genes encoding TTC0105 and TTC0106 form a single operon (Fig. 4A) and are probably transcribed from a transcriptional start site immediately upstream of the TTC0105 coding region. To examine whether or not TTC0105 and TTC0106 are involved in s2T biosynthesis, we constructed insertion mutants of ttc0106 or ttc0105 and analyzed the modified nucleosides of unfractionated tRNA using LC/MS. In order to avoid polar effects in the ttc0105 insertion strain, ttc0106 was constructed so as to be transcribed together with a drug resistance gene. In both mutants, s2T (27.7 min) was completely absent, although its precursor rT (21.4 min) was detected (Fig. 4B); other nucleoside modifications remained unchanged. These results suggest that both TTC0105 and TTC0106 are involved in s2T biosynthesis. A small peak (27.5 min) from dinucleotide GmpG was observed immediately before the s2T peak and was derived from incomplete digestion of tRNA. This assignment was confirmed by the mass spectrum (m/z = 643) and by the disappearance of the peak in trmH, a Gm18-methylase mutant (data not shown). Thus, we have renamed the proteins TTC0106 and TTC0105 to tRNA two-thiouridine-synthesizing protein A and B (TtuA and TtuB), respectively, and the corresponding genes are now designated ttuA and ttuB. The precursor of s2T was identified as rT, suggesting that the 5-methyltransferase that modifies U at position 54 (TrmFO) (20Urbonavičius J. Skouloubris S. Myllykallio H. Grosjean H.

We describe here the expression of a recombinant form of Aprataxin and show that it has dual DNA binding and nucleotide hydrolase activities. This protein binds to double-stranded DNA with high affinity but is also capable of binding double-stranded RNA and single-strand DNA, with increased affinity for hairpin structures. No increased binding was observed with a variety of DNA structures mimicking intermediates in DNA repair. The DNA binding observed here was not dependent on zinc, and the addition of exogenous zinc abolished DNA binding. We also demonstrate that Aprataxin hydrolyzes with similar efficiency the model histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein substrate, AMPNH2, and the Fragile histidine triad protein substrate, Ap4A. These activities were significantly reduced in the presence of duplex DNA and to a lesser extent in the presence of single-strand DNA, and removal of the N-terminal Forkhead associated domain did not alter activity. Finally, comparison of sequence relationships between the histidine triad superfamily members shows that Aprataxin forms a distinct branch in this superfamily. In addition to its capacity for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, the observation that it also binds DNA and RNA adds a new dimension to this superfamily of proteins and provides further support for a role for Aprataxin in the cellular response to DNA damage.

Aprataxin has also been shown to form part of a novel single-strand break repair complex that includes XRCC1 and DNA ligase 3 (9Luo H. Chan D.W. Yang T. Rodriguez M. Chen B.P. Leng M. Mu J. Chen D. Songyang Z. Wang Y. Qin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8356-8365Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This complex is distinct from the single-strand break repair complex that includes XRCC1, DNA ligase 3, polynucleotide kinase, and polymerase β. The N-terminal 20 amino acids of the Aprataxin FHA domain was found to interact with XRCC1 and was dependent on the phosphorylation of XRCC1 (5Date H. Igarashi S. Sano Y. Takahashi T. Takahashi T.

A role for Aprataxin in the cellular response to DNA damage is further substantiated by enhanced sensitivity of AOA1 cells to a variety of genotoxic agents. AOA1 cells are hypersensitive to agents that cause single-strand breaks in DNA, including hydrogen peroxide and methyl methanesulfonate (6Gueven N. Becherel O.J. Kijas A.W. Chen P. Howe O. Rudolph J.H. Gatti R. Date H. Onodera O. Taucher-Scholz G. Lavin M.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These cells also display higher levels of induced chromosomal aberrations in response to these agents compared with control cells. No increased sensitivity was observed after mitomycin C or ionizing radiation exposure (6Gueven N. Becherel O.J. Kijas A.W. Chen P. Howe O. Rudolph J.H. Gatti R. Date H. Onodera O. Taucher-Scholz G. Lavin M.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Clements P.M. Breslin C. Deeks E.D. Byrd P.J. Ju L. Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Moreira M. Taylor A.M.R. Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Together these observations point to a role for Aprataxin in the cellular response to DNA single-strand breaks. Evidence for such a role was recently provided by Mosesso et al. (10Mosesso P. Piane M. Palitti F. Pepe G. Penna S. Chessa L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), who demonstrated an inability of AOA1 cells to process camptothecin-induced DNA damage using the comet assay. It remains unclear as to what the exact role of Aprataxin is in the cellular response to DNA damage. The examination of the putative functional domains within Aprataxin provides evidence as to what this role might be. The presence of a HIT domain in the central region of the molecule suggests that it has nucleotide hydrolase activity. The HIT domain superfamily of proteins is characterized by the presence of the HIT motif, HXHXHXX where X is a hydrophobic amino acid. This superfamily consists of four branches including histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein (HINT), fragile histidine triad (FHIT), galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, and DcpS, a scavenger pyrophosphatase (11Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 12Liu H. Rodger N.D. Jiao X. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).

Nishiwaki T. Ueno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) showed that Aprataxin branches more closely with FHIT family proteins. The FHIT family has been shown to hydrolyze diadenosine polyphosphate substrates. Contrary to this, Aprataxin has also been classified as a HINT protein (11Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Kwasnicka D.A. Krakowiak A. Thacker C. Brenner C. Vincent S.R. J. Biol.

The recent reports on the catalytic activity of bacterially expressed recombinant Aprataxin have also been conflicting (13Hirano M. Furiya Y. Kariya S. Nishiwaki T. Ueno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Seidle H.F. Bieganowski P. Brenner C. J. Biol.

Commun. 2004; 322: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) reported that due to intramolecular inhibition by the FHA domain, there was no significant hydrolysis on GpppBODIPY, a known fluorogenic substrate for FHIT family proteins (16Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When they added the N-terminal FHA domain separately from the C-terminal portion of the Aprataxin protein, they found low levels of activity, Kcat = 1.78 × 10–3 s–1, and mutations in the HIT domain abrogated this activity. In contrast, Seidle et al. (15Seidle H.F. Bieganowski P. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) obtained similar low levels of activity (Kcat = 0.4 × 10–3 s–1) using the full-length protein on the same substrate but observed no apparent inhibition by the FHA domain. They also demonstrated activity (Kcat = 2.8 × 10–3 s–1) on the HINT model substrate, tert-butoxycarbonyl-l-lysine methylcoumarinamide, an AMP molecule linked to lysine. Here we describe the expression of a yeast recombinant human Aprataxin protein and its purification to a single detectable band after SDS-PAGE. We demonstrate for the first time that Aprataxin possesses both DNA and RNA binding activities as well as a capacity to hydrolyze nucleotide-based substrates. The presence of DNA significantly reduced nucleotide hydrolase activity. Expression Construct—Aprataxin was cloned into the yeast overexpression plasmid pMH1, which has been adapted for the use of the self-cleaving affinity technology of New England Biolabs IMPACT-CN system (17Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The entire coding region of human APTX (NP_778243) lacking the stop codon was amplified using primers 5′-TTTGTCGACATGATGCGGGTGTGCTGGTTG-3′ and 5′-CTGTGTCCAGTGCTTCCTGAGAT G-3′, designed to introduce a SalI site at the 5′ end of the PCR product. This was digested with SalI and cloned into pMH1, which had been digested with SalI-SmaI to remove the MLH1 gene, creating pMHA. This cloning strategy results is the addition of a glycine to the C terminus of the human Aprataxin protein after intein cleavage. The Aprataxin V263G mutant was cloned as above and had been previously generated, as described in Gueven et al. (6Gueven N. Becherel O.J. Kijas A.W. Chen P. Howe O. Rudolph J.H. Gatti R. Date H. Onodera O. Taucher-Scholz G. Lavin M.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression constructs of full-length, N-terminal deleted, C-terminal deleted, and N-and C-terminal deleted forms of Aprataxin were prepared using PCR with the following primer sets: 5′-CGGGATCCATGATGCGGGTGTGCTGGTTG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACTGTGTCCAGTGCTTCCT-3′; 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGGCAACAGTGATTCTATAGA-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACTGTGTCCAGTGCTTCCT-3′; 5′-CGGGATCCA TGATGATGCGGGTGTGCTGGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAACGAAGGGGCAGCTTCA-3′; 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGGCAACAGTGATTCTATAGA-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAACGAAGGGGCAGCTTCA-3′, respectively. These amplifications introduced BamHI and XhoI sites for cloning into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). This cloning strategy leads to the addition of five amino acids (GPLGS) to the N terminus after cleavage with PreScission protease. Overexpression and Purification—The pMHA construct was introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, BJ2168, using the standard lithium acetate transformation method followed by selection on tryptophan drop out minimal media. Subsequent growth and overexpression was also performed in this medium at 25–30 °C. Transformants were used to inoculate overnight starter cultures with 2% glucose as the carbon source. These saturated cultures were diluted 1/100 and regrown in media using 2% glycerol and 2% lactate as carbon sources to an A600 of 0.9. Cells were harvested and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, then cell pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of chitin 500 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl) before freezing small beads on dry ice. Frozen cells were ground in dry ice using a coffee grinder. Ground cells were defrosted on ice and resuspended in 5 volumes of chitin 500 buffer with 0.01 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. This lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. All the subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The clarified lysate was loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto a 1-ml chitin column equilibrated with chitin 500 buffer. The column was washed with 10 volumes of chitin 500 buffer, 5 volumes of chitin 1000 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol, 1000 mm NaCl), 5 volumes of cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA pH8, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF) without dithiothreitol, then with 5 volumes of cleavage buffer with dithiothreitol and clamped to enable cleavage (16 h at 4 °C). Cleaved protein was eluted, concentrated, and diluted to a final concentration of 200 mm NaCl with water then loaded at 0.3 ml/min onto a 1-ml Biorex 70 cation exchange resin (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A200 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm, EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl). The column was washed with 20 volumes of buffer A200 before elution with 10 volumes of buffer A380 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm, EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol, 380 mm NaCl), collecting 1-ml fractions. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated then diluted with an equal volume of water before snap-freezing on dry ice and subsequent storage at –70 °C. Purity was assessed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent Coomassie R250 staining as well as Western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-Aprataxin antibody raised against the full-length yeast recombinant protein. For experiments comparing the effect of EDTA on the recombinant protein, 2 protein preparations were made in parallel as above either with 1 mm EDTA in all buffers or was left out for control no EDTA preparation. The mutant V263G protein was purified as outlined above for the chitin affinity chromatography strategy, with the inclusion of an ATP wash (5 volumes, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, and 200 μm ATP) incorporated after the chitin 1000 wash. This was included to remove a 70-kDa co-purifying protein that appears to be a chaperone protein (HSP70) based on previous reports (17Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Also, cleavage was performed at a higher temperature, 16 °C and for longer (24 h), to enhance the poor cleavage. In experiments where the V263G protein was used, wild type protein purified in the same manner was employed. The bacterial pGEX-6P-1 constructs were transformed into BL21 E. coli for overexpression at 25 °C. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm) was added for 2.5 h to induce protein expression. Cells were lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation (20,000 g × 40 min). The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences), glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was cleaved with an overnight incubation with PreScission protease, and proteins were recovered in the eluate. These proteins were further purified on a Biorex 70 cation exchange resin. DNA Binding Assays—DNA binding was investigated using electrophoretic mobility shift assay using different size single-strand and duplex oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides were radiolabeled by polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and annealed to create duplexes. Sequences are based on those used by Chi and Kolodner (18Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29984-29992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are designed to minimize secondary structure. A common 21-base bottom oligo, 5′-TCAGCAGATAGGAACCATACT-3′, was annealed to the top sequences to create the various DNA structures: homoduplex, 5′-AGTATGGTTCCTATCTGCTGA-3′; mismatch, (G-A), 5′-AGTATGGTTCCGATCTGCTGA-3′; flap, 5′-AGTATGGTTCCTTAGACGACT-3′; 6-base pair hairpin, 5′-AGTATGGTTCGAGTACGTACTCCTATCTGCTGA-3′; nick, 5′-ATCTGCTGA-3′ and 5′-AGTATGGTTCCT-3′; one-base gap, 5′-ATCTGCTGA-3′ and 5′-AGTATGGTTCC-3′. RNA binding was investigated using a 21-base pair diced RNA sequence (DNA-PKcs) kindly provided by Dr. Rick Woods. The 11- and 37-bp duplexes were created as outlined above by annealing sequences: 5′-AGTATGGTTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAACCATACT-3′; 5′-ATGTGAATCAGTATGGTTCCTATCTGCTGAAGGAAAT-3′ and 5′-ATTTCCTTCAGCAGATAGGAACCATACTGATTCACAT-3′. A nick was introduced into the 37-bp sequence after nucleotide 16 by annealing the two corresponding oligonucleotides. Base 17 was left out, and the same strategy was used to create a gapped substrate. Binding reactions were performed on ice for 15 min in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 20 ng/μl acetylated bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl (unless otherwise stated), and 8% sucrose. The nucleic acid substrates were present at 1 pmol per reaction unless otherwise stated, and Aprataxin was included as indicated. Zinc sulfate was included where indicated by preincubating Aprataxin with zinc for 15 min before the addition of radiolabeled DNA duplex. Samples were run in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 20 mA for 25–35 min at 5 °C. Gels were dried on Whatman No. 3MM and visualized by x-ray film. Quantitation was performed by scanning films and using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The percent bound was estimated as bound/(bound + unbound). Catalytic Activity Assays—Initial experiments using pH 6, 7, and 8 HEPES buffer established that maximum catalytic activity was obtained at pH 7, which was used for subsequent investigations. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 20 min to 3 h in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 30 mm NaCl, 1 μm Aprataxin with nucleotide substrates, ATP (Sigma), dATP (Fisher), AMPNH2 (Sigma), and Ap4A (Sigma) at 0.02–1.5 mm in 10-μl reactions. DNA duplex or single-strand oligonucleotide was added as indicated. The products of hydrolysis were resolved and quantitated using anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography on a Hypersil SAX column 250 × 4.6 mm (Phenomenex). Parent substrates used here and products of the hydrolysis reactions, AMP and ATP, were identified by retention times and co-elution with standards and quantified based on their absorbance at 259 nm. The reaction products were resolved using a gradient starting with 1 mm ammonium phosphate buffer, pH 2.8, 0–40%, run against 750 mm ammonium phosphate buffer, pH 3.7, for all reactions except AMPNH2. These reaction products were resolved using a gradient starting with water 0–40% run against 750 mm ammonium phosphate buffer, pH 3.7, where AMP was the only detectable product. Peak areas were used to generate a standard curve for AMP over the range 50–1000 pmol (R2 = 0.99), indicating both a linear and sensitive detection of the primary product of hydrolysis. Determinations of kinetic parameters were made by estimating the best fit curve to the Michaelis equation using an Excel macro available online at University of Paisley, Department of Biological Sciences. Phylogenetic Tree Analysis—Human sequences (NP_778243, NP_005331, Q9BX68, NP_612638, AAL40394, NP_000146, NP_054745, AAH32336, including Hint2 and Hint3) were used from each branch Hint1, FHIT, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, DcpS, and Aprataxin to identify orthologs in mouse (NP_079821, NP_032274, NP_057867, NP_081306, AAC24117) bony fish (NP_999894, AAH81526, CAF92838, AAP47149, NP_957034) and yeast (NP_014901, NP_010158, NP_009574, NP_014816, NP_010591) by pBAST. These were then aligned by on-line ClustalW multiple sequence alignment program using the default parameters at the European Bioinformatics Institute web site. The alignment was imported into Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA Version 2.1) to build a Neighbor-Joining tree with pairwise deletion and Poisson correction using human Chk2 (NP_001005735) as the root. The reliability of the inferred tree was analyzed by the bootstrap test, 1000 replications. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Aprataxin—Full-length Aprataxin cDNA was cloned into a self-cleaving affinity expression construct as described by Hall and Kunkel (17Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This yeast expression system is driven by a GAL1 promoter inducing overexpression of an Aprataxin fusion protein. Purification of the fusion protein was achieved by affinity chromatography utilizing the chitin binding domain followed by dithiothreitol-induced self-cleavage. Further purification was carried out using cation exchange chromatography. This approach generated a single detectable protein by Coomassie R250 staining (Fig. 1A). An antibody generated against the full-length Aprataxin protein did not detect any degradation products by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). This expression system was also used to produce the V263G mutant form of Aprataxin (Fig. 1C). This mutation is located within the HIT motif of Aprataxin and was identified in a Japanese AOA1 patient (2Date H. Onodera O. Tanaka H. Iwabuchi K. Uekawa K. Igarashi S. Koike R. Hiroi T. Yuasa T. Awaya Y. Sakai T. Takahashi T. Nagatomo H. Sekijima Y. Kawachi I. Takiyama Y. Nishizawa M. Fukuhara N. Saito K. Sugano S. Tsuji S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The recovery of mutant protein was 95-fold lower than that obtained for the wild type protein after elution from the chitin resin and less pure as is evident from Fig. 1C. This was not due to reduced levels of the induced fusion protein in yeast cell extracts, which were comparable by Western blot analysis (data not shown), but due to reduced binding to the chitin resin and extremely inefficient cleavage even with increased temperature and length of the cleavage compared with the wild type protein. DNA Binding Activity—AOA1 cells are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents and are defective in repair of DNA single-strand breaks (6Gueven N. Becherel O.J. Kijas A.W. Chen P. Howe O. Rudolph J.H.

Aprataxin has also been shown to bind to several proteins involved in DNA repair and localizes to the site of DNA damage. Accordingly, we investigated whether Aprataxin was capable of binding directly to DNA. Using gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that recombinant Aprataxin was able to bind to a 21-base pair double-stranded DNA molecule (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). A single discrete binding species was observed at low concentrations of Aprataxin. Increasing the concentration of Aprataxin gave rise to a second and more retarded band, indicating more than one molecule of Aprataxin binding to each duplex (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Under the conditions used Aprataxin failed to form a stable complex with single-stranded DNA, but there was evidence of some nonspecific binding or uns"

https://openalex.org/W2086742737,"TCF-4 is the main effector of the Wnt/Wingless signalling pathway. As with other TCF/LEF factors, numerous alternative splicings at its 3' end affect its expression. Such a mechanism leads to the synthesis of numerous TCF-4 isoforms among which some contain binding domains for CtBP, an ubiquitous transcriptional corepressor. Of interest, we described a frequent TCF-4 frameshift mutation in mismatch-repair deficient colorectal cancers (MSI-H cancers) that leads to the selective loss of TCF-4 isoforms with CtBP binding abilities. We provide here data that argue for a partial colocalization of CtBP with TCF-4 isoforms containing CtBP binding domains in cellulo, and for a functional role of CtBP in repressing TCF-4 mediated transcription. We also demonstrate that such a colocalization is not observed in MSI-H colorectal cancer cells that harbour the TCF-4 frameshift mutation, and that CtBP is not able to repress TCF-4-mediated transcription in this context. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that CtBP would play a role in regulating TCF-4 mediated transcription upon its binding with some TCF-4 isoforms encoded by alternatively spliced mRNA. They also suggest a role for TCF-4 frameshift mutation during MSI-H colorectal tumour progression, by regulating the relative proportion of the different TCF-4 isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1974073178,"Elevated levels of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA or spcDNA) are closely associated with genomic instability and aging. Despite extensive studies, the mechanism of its generation in mammalian cells is unknown. We report here that mouse major satellite DNA (MSD) is prone to eccDNA formation and that the resulting molecules are multimeres of the basic repeat. Extrachromosomal circular major satellite (ECMS) DNA constitutes the majority of eccDNA in B16 mouse melanoma cells and is highly abundant in other mouse cells. Production of these molecules is enhanced in proliferating cells, suggesting that processes associated with DNA replication are involved in their appearance. Using siRNA technique we show that DNA Ligase IV is engaged in ECMS synthesis. Based on our findings we propose a novel two-step model for eccDNA formation in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2139866542,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder biochemically characterized by elevated levels of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA). Excess levels of VLCFAs are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of X-ALD. Therefore, therapeutic approaches for X-ALD are focused on the reduction or normalization of VLCFAs. In this study, we investigated an alternative oxidation route for VLCFAs, namely ω-oxidation. The results described in this study show that VLCFAs are substrates for the ω-oxidation system in human liver microsomes. Moreover, VLCFAs were not only converted into ω-hydroxy fatty acids, but they were also further oxidized to dicarboxylic acids via cytochrome P450-mediated reactions. High sensitivity toward the specific P450 inhibitor 17-octadecynoic acid suggested that ω-hydroxylation of VLCFAs is catalyzed by P450 enzymes belonging to the CYP4A/F subfamilies. Studies with individually expressed human recombinant P450 enzymes revealed that two P450 enzymes, i.e. CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B, participate in the ω-hydroxylation of VLCFAs. Both enzymes belong to the cytochrome P450 4F subfamily and have a high affinity for VLCFAs. In summary, this study demonstrates that VLCFAs are substrates for the human ω-oxidation system, and for this reason, stimulation of the in vivo VLCFA ω-oxidation pathway may provide an alternative mode of treatment to reduce the levels of VLCFAs in patients with X-ALD.

In mammalian cells, fatty acid oxidation plays a major role in the production of energy, particularly in the heart and skeletal muscle, and is the main energy source during periods of fasting. Both mitochondria and peroxisomes are capable of degrading saturated fatty acids via β-oxidation. Short-, medium-, and long-chain saturated fatty acids are degraded predominantly by mitochondria, whereas very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA, 2The abbreviations used are: VLCFA, very long-chain fatty acid; X-ALD, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy; ALDP, adrenoleukodystrophy protein; ω-hydroxy-C26:0, 26-hydroxy-hexacosanoic acid; C26:0-DCA, hexacosanedioic acid; CYP, cytochrome P450; CAR, constitutive androstane receptor; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. >22 carbons) are β-oxidized exclusively in peroxisomes (1Wanders R.J.

Chem. 2004; 50: 1824-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, peroxisomes also metabolize certain branched chain fatty acids, bile acid precursors, eicosanoids, and dicarboxylic acids (3Wanders R.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD: MIM 300100), the most common peroxisomal disorder, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the cerebral white matter, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, adrenal cortex, and testis (4Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. Powers J. Moser A.B. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 8th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases Of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York2001: 3257-3301Google Scholar). X-ALD is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene that encodes ALDP, an ATP-binding cassette transporter located in the peroxisomal membrane with an unknown function (5Mosser J. Douar A.M. Sarde C.O. Kioschis P. Feil R. Moser H. Poustka A.M. Mandel J.L. Aubourg P. Nature. 1993; 361: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Biochemically, X-ALD is characterized by elevated levels of saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs in plasma and tissues due to the impaired β-oxidation of VLCFAs in peroxisomes (6Igarashi M. Schaumburg H.H. Powers J. Kishmoto Y. Kolodny E. Suzuki K. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 7Singh I. Moser A.E. Moser H.W. Kishimoto Y. Pediatr.

Metab. 2003; 79: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Since the pathogenesis of X-ALD is probably due to the increased levels of VLCFAs, correction of VLCFA levels is one of the primary objectives in therapeutic approaches. These include gene replacement therapy, bone marrow transplantation, lovastatin treatment, inhibition of VLCFA biosynthesis by mono-unsaturated fatty acids, notably oleic acid (C18:1ω9) and erucic acid (C22:1ω9) (Lorenzo's oil), and induction of the expression of ALDP-related protein (see Ref. 4Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. Powers J. Moser A.B. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 8th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases Of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York2001: 3257-3301Google Scholar for an overview). Despite the increasing knowledge about X-ALD, there is currently no effective therapy for this disease. An alternative method to degrade VLCFAs would be the ω-oxidation followed by β-oxidation of the dicarboxylic acids produced. Different fatty acids are known to undergo ω-oxidation, but no data in literature are available with respect to the ω-oxidation of VLCFAs (9Okita R.T. Okita J.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The first step in ω-oxidation of fatty acids involves the conversion of the ω-methyl group of the fatty acid into an ω-hydroxyl group. This reaction is carried out by one or more cytochrome P450 enzymes mainly belonging to the CYP4 subfamily and requires NADPH and molecular oxygen (9Okita R.T. Okita J.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Xu F. Falck J.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kroetz D.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 308: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the ω-hydroxy fatty acid may be oxidized further into a ω-carboxylic acid either via an NAD+-dependent alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase system or via a cytochrome P450-mediated route (11Kundu R.K. Tonsgard J.H. Getz G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Robbins K.C. Arch. Biochem.

Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, dicarboxylic acids can be β-oxidized in peroxisomes and/or mitochondria to shorter-chain dicarboxylic acids followed by excretion into the urine (15Ferdinandusse S. Denis S. Van Roermund C.W. Wanders R.J. Dacremont G. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1104-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Kolvraa S. Gregersen N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Accumulation of dicarboxylic acids has not been detected in X-ALD patients, whereas in patients with a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder, elevated levels of medium- and long-chain dicarboxylic acids were found in urine (17Rocchiccioli F. Aubourg P. Bougneres P.F. Pediatr. Res. 1986; 20: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-oxidation of long-chain dicarboxylic acids was normal in fibroblasts from X-ALD patients and deficient in fibroblasts from peroxisomal biogenesis disorder patients (15Ferdinandusse S. Denis S. Van Roermund C.W. Wanders R.J. Dacremont G. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1104-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that peroxisomes play an essential role in dicarboxylic acid degradation and that this metabolic route does not require ALDP. Under normal physiological conditions, fatty acid ω-oxidation is a minor oxidation pathway that accounts for 5–10% of total fatty acid oxidation in the liver, but the expression levels of many cytochrome P450s can be induced by a variety of different agents (18Dickins M. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 1745-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Bjorkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 585-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if VLCFAs can indeed undergo ω-oxidation, then stimulation of this activity could be a means to reduce the levels of these fatty acids in patients with X-ALD. In this study, we investigated the VLCFA ω-oxidation capacity of human liver microsomes. Until now, ω-oxidation of VLCFAs has not been studied in humans, and none of the enzymes potentially involved in this system have been characterized. We have studied the ω-oxidation pathway for several saturated fatty acids known to be of relevance to X-ALD, which includes docosanoic acid (C22:0), tetracosanoic acid (C24:0), and hexacosanoic acid (C26:0). Materials—Pooled human liver microsomes and the recombinant human P450-containing insect cell microsomes and control microsomes (SupersomesTM) used in this study were purchased from BD Biosciences/Gentest. The cytochrome P450 content of SupersomesTM as provided by the manufacturer was as follows: CYP2E1 (588 pmol/mg), CYP2J2 (185 pmol/mg), CYP3A4 (606 pmol/mg), CYP4A11 (120 pmol/mg), CYP4F2 (556 pmol/mg), CYP4F3A (33 pmol/mg), CYP4F3B (435 pmol/mg), CYP4 F12 (213 pmol/mg), and control (not detectable). 22-Hydroxy-docosanoic acid (ω-hydroxy-C22:0) and hexacosanedioic acid (C26:0-DCA) were purchased from Larodan Fine Chemicals (Malmö, Sweden). Sulfaphenazole, quinidine, ketoconazole, furafylline, trimethoprim, diethyldithiocarbamate, and 17-octadecynoic acid were purchased from Sigma. N, O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane was from Pierce. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Enzymatic Assay for VLCFA ω-Hydroxylation—The experimental conditions used in this study to study the hydroxylation of different VLCFAs were adapted from previous experiments with minor modifications (14Sanders R.J. Ofman R. Valianpour F. Kemp S. Wanders R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, incubations were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in a reaction mixture that contained Tris buffer, pH 8.4 (100 mm), protein (50 μg), α-cyclodextrin (1 mg/ml), and NADPH (1 mm) in a total volume of 200 μl, unless otherwise stated. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the fatty acid at a final concentration of 200 μm and terminated by the addition of 1 ml of hydrochloric acid to a final concentration of 1.7 m. The reaction products were extracted as described previously and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (8Valianpour F. Selhorst J.J. van Lint L.E. van Gennip A.H. Wanders R.J. Kemp S. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 79: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Sanders R.J. Ofman R. Valianpour F. Kemp S. Wanders R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Characterization of ω-Hydroxy Fatty Acids by GC-MS—Incubations were carried out under the same conditions as described above in a total volume of 2 ml. After acidification of the mixture, fatty acids were extracted four times with 5 ml of hexane and subsequently dried under a stream of nitrogen. Prior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the residue was incubated with 40 μlof N, O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane and 10 μl of pyridine at 80 °C for 1 h. After derivatization, the mixture was used directly for GC-MS analysis on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5973 mass-selective detector (Palo Alto, CA). The samples (1 μl) were injected in the splitless mode (Hewlett Packard 7683 injector) and separated on a CP-Sil 5 CB-MS low bleed column (25 m × 0.25 mm × 0.30 μm: Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands). The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 2 min at 85 °C followed by a linear increase of 20 °C per min to 320 °C and held at 320 °C for 10 min. The identities of the reaction products were verified by taking mass spectra in the scanning electron impact mode. The single ion monitoring mode was applied for the detection of the respective (M-15)+ ions, with m/z 485, 513, and 541 of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of ω and (ω-1)-hydroxy C22:0, C24:0, and C26:0, respectively. The (M-15)+ ions, with m/z 499, 427, and 555, were monitored for the (M-15)+ ions of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the dicarboxylic acid of C22:0, C24:0, and C26:0, respectively. The ratio ofω and (ω-1) hydroxy fatty acids was calculated by comparing the peak areas of the single ion current of theω-hydroxy fatty acid and dicarboxylic acid, with the peak area of the (ω-1)-hydroxy fatty acid. Curve-fitting Procedure—The best-fit curves to the product formation data in human liver microsomes were obtained from the kinetic equation for the dual-enzyme Michaelis-Menten model, V=Vmax1·SKm1+S+Vmax2·SKm2+S where Km1 and Km2 are the high and low affinity Michaelis-Menten constants, respectively, and Vmax1 and Vmax2 are the corresponding maximal catalytic activities. The best-fit curves to the product formation with individually expressed human recombinant P450 enzymes were calculated using a cooperative single-enzyme model with two binding sites (Equation 2) in which product can be formed either from the single-substrate-bound form or from the two-substrate-bound form of the enzyme (20Korzekwa K.R. Krishnamachary N. Shou M. Ogai A. Parise R.A. Rettie A.E. Gonzalez F.J. Tracy T.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4137-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). V=Vmax1·SKm1+Vmax2·S2Km1·Km21+SKm1+S2Km1·Km2(Eq. 2) The values of the kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the experimental data in the appropriate enzyme model using the IGOR Pro 5 software program (Wavemetrics). Optimization of the VLCFA Hydroxylation Assay—Previous studies have demonstrated that C22:0 is a substrate for the ω-oxidation system in rat liver microsomes (14Sanders R.J. Ofman R. Valianpour F. Kemp S. Wanders R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To study the ω-hydroxylation capacity of human liver microsomes for VLCFAs, the hydroxylation assay was optimized for the ω-oxidation of C26:0. To this end, human microsomal protein was incubated in a buffered medium containing NADPH and α-cyclodextrin to solubilize C26:0. The production of ω-hydroxy-C26:0 was linear with time up to 30 min (Fig. 1A). The effect of pH on the hydroxylation activity was determined using a combined buffer system that contained 100 mm HEPES and 100 mm glycine to cover the pH range 6.6–10.5. Fig. 1B shows that the formation of ω-hydroxy-C26:0 was maximal at pH 8.4. Interestingly, the oxidation of C26:0 was not limited to the production of ω-hydroxy-C26:0, but also, the corresponding dicarboxylic acid (C26:0-DCA) was detected. The identity of C26:0-DCA was confirmed by two signals that appeared in the electrospray ionization mass spectra, which corresponded to its single and double negative charged state (data not shown), as well as by GC-MS studies (see below). The formation of C26:0-DCA from C26:0 was linear with time and maximal at the same pH as for the formation of ω-hydroxy-C26:0 (Fig. 1, A and B). Total product formation was linear with protein up to 60 μg/ml (Fig. 1C). At higher protein concentrations, the production of ω-hydroxy-C26:0 decreased, whereas C26:0-DCA formation increased slightly. Several buffer systems at pH 8.4 were tested: 100 mm Tris, 100 mm Tricine, and 100 mm Hepes. Hydroxylation of C26:0 was maximal with Tris as buffer (results not shown), which has therefore been used in subsequent experiments. Kinetic Analysis of VLCFA Hydroxylation—The enzyme kinetics for the hydroxylation of C22:0, C24:0, and C26:0 were analyzed. To determine apparent Km and Vmax values for the different fatty acids, rates of product formation were determined at different substrate concentrations (Fig. 2). Interestingly, at the highest substrate concentrations used, the ratio of ω-hydroxy/dicarboxylic acid produced decreased with increasing chain length of the substrate. Furthermore, the rate of total product formation versus substrate concentration of all fatty acids used did not follow simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Different models were tested for data fitting. However, the model for dual-enzyme Michaelis-Menten kinetics as described under “Experimental Procedures” produced the best fit of the data points of Fig. 2. The kinetic parameters calculated from the experimental data of each of the different substrates using this model are listed in Table 1. At low substrate concentrations, the highest activity was observed with C22:0 with an apparent Vmax of 0.8 nmol · min–1 · mg–1, whereas the highest affinity was observed for C26:0 with an apparent Km of <1 μm. The results described in Table 1 show that the highest catalytic efficiency, Vmax/Km ratio, is observed for C26:0. The hydroxylation efficiency for C24:0 and C22:0 is 10-fold lower as compared with C26:0. Overall, these results demonstrate that VLCFAs are substrates for the human microsomal ω-oxidation system.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters derived from the experimental data in Fig. 2 of VLCFA hydroxylation by human liver microsomesHigh affinityLow affinityRatio of ω:(ω-1)Km1Vmax1Vmax1/Km1Km2Vmax2Vmax2/Km2μmnmol·min-1·mg-110-2μmnmol·min-1·mg-110-2C22:05.80.81440212.73.253:1C24:06.70.57.531515.95.061:1C26:00.10.11102107.32.232:1 Open table in a new tab Characterization of VLCFA ω-Oxidation Products—Hydroxylation of VLCFAs by cytochrome P450 enzymes may occur at the ω-position as well as at the adjacent positions (9Okita R.T.

To determine the position of the hydroxyl group, reaction products of the incubations with C22:0, C24:0, and C26:0 were analyzed by GC-MS. Three products appeared in the gas chromatogram after incubating human liver microsomes with C26:0 (Fig. 3). The major peak (Fig. 3, peak II) with a retention time of 14.5 min was analyzed by mass spectral analysis and identified as ω-hydroxy-C26:0 (Fig. 4A). The fragment at m/z 103 is characteristic of ω-hydroxy fatty acids, representing the terminal CH2OSi(CH3)3 moiety (22Jakobs C. Bojasch M. Monch E. Rating D. Siemes H. Hanefeld F. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1981; 111: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The fragments observed in this mass spectrum were in analogy with those of the commercially available 22-hydroxy-C22:0 (data not shown). The minor peak in the GC chromatogram with a retention time of 14.25 min (Fig. 3, peak I) was identified by mass spectral analysis as (ω-1)-hydroxy-C26:0 (Fig. 4B). It was deduced from the mass spectrum that the peak at m/z 117 represents the CH3CHOSi(CH3)3 due to cleavage of the molecule adjacent to the hydroxyl group. Hydroxylated products of C26:0 with the hydroxyl group at other positions than ω and (ω-1) were not detected. In addition, the third peak (Fig. 3, peak III) with retention time of 14.85 min was identified as C26:0-DCA (Fig. 4C). The fragmentation pattern of this compound was identical to that of the commercial available C26:0-DCA (not shown). Product analysis of incubations with C22:0 and C24:0 as substrates resulted in similar patterns of product formation and analogous mass spectra as observed for C26:0 (data not shown). The ratio ω/(ω-1)-hydroxylation for each substrate is listed in Table 1. Apparently, cytochrome P450 enzymes preferably hydroxylate VLCFAs at the methyl group.FIGURE 4Characterization of the C26:0 ω-oxidation intermediates from the peaks in Fig. 3. Based on the fragmentation spectra, the trimethylsilyl derivative was identified as peak II, ω-hydroxy-C26:0 (A); peak I, (ω-1)-hydroxy-C26:0 (B); and peak III, C26:0-DCA (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) VLCFA Hydroxylation Inhibition Studies—The first step of the ω-oxidation of fatty acids is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The human cytochrome P450 family consists of at least 57 CYP isoforms that are able to oxidize a broad spectrum of chemical compounds (23Lewis D.F. Pharmacogenomics. 2004; 5: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To identify the P450 subfamily and/or the individual CYP isoform that is involved in VLCFA hydroxylation, various inhibitors were tested, which include: sulfaphenazole (selective for CYP2C) (24Newton D.J. Wang R.W. Lu A.Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 154-158PubMed Google Scholar), quinidine (for CYP2D6) (24Newton D.J. Wang R.W. Lu A.Y. Drug Metab.

Pharmacol. 1998; 45: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), trimethoprim (for CYP2C8) (27Wen X. Wang J.S. Backman J.T. Laitila J. Neuvonen P.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and 17-octadecynoic acid (for CYP4A/F) (10Xu F. Falck J.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kroetz D.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 308: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Nguyen X. Wang M.H. Reddy K.M. Falck J.R. Schwartzman M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R1691-R1700PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 5, the effect of these inhibitors on the ω-oxidation of C26:0 is shown. Hydroxylation of C26:0 was inhibited markedly by 17-octadecynoic acid already at the lowest concentration used (1 μm), and no ω-oxidation products were detected at the highest concentration of inhibitor used (100 μm). In the presence of 1 μm troleandomycin, product formation was decreased by 20%. Diethyldithiocarbamate and ketoconazole, inhibitors of CYP2E1 and CYP3A, respectively, had some inhibitory effect at the highest concentration inhibitor used (100 μm). All other inhibitors tested did not affect the hydroxylation of C26:0 to any significant extent. Identification of P450 VLCFA Hydroxylases—The results from the VLCFA inhibition studies indicated that cytochrome P450 enzymes belonging to the CYP2E1, CYP3A, and CYP4A/F subfamily are likely to be involved in the hydroxylation of these fatty acids. To confirm this, several human recombinant P450 enzymes (SupersomesTM) were tested for hydroxylation activity toward C26:0. SupersomesTM are microsomes from baculovirus-infected insect cells expressing a single human CYP isoform. These experiments revealed that CYP4F2 as well as CYP4F3B catalyzed the hydroxylation of C26:0 (Fig. 6). All other recombinant CYP isoforms tested, as well as non-CYP-containing SupersomesTM, did not hydroxylate C26:0 to any appreciable extent. Kinetic Analysis of VLCFA Hydroxylation by CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B—The enzyme kinetics of CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B were analyzed for the hydroxylation of different VLCFAs. Figs. 7 and 8 show that hydroxylation of VLCFAs was not limited to the production of the ω-hydroxylated product, but dicarboxylic acids were produced as well. The rate of total product formation versus substrate concentration again did not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The plots were hyperbolic, and product formation was not saturable, even at the highest substrate concentration used (200 μm). The corresponding Eadie-Hofstee plots were biphasic (data not shown), indicating apparent multiple binding site kinetics (20Korzekwa K.R. Krishnamachary N. Shou M. Ogai A. Parise R.A. Rettie A.E. Gonzalez F.J. Tracy T.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4137-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the kinetic parameters of CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B for the fatty acids tested, different enzyme kinetic models were analyzed. A cooperative single-enzyme model with two binding sites as described under “Experimental Procedures” resulted in the best fit of the data points of Figs. 7 and 8. The kinetic parameters calculated for each of the different substrates are listed in Table 2. Apparent Km values of both enzymes for VLCFAs were in the micromolar range. The highest VLCFA hydroxylation activity was observed for CYP4F3B. Although CYP4F2 was found to be less active toward VLCFAs, Vmax/Km ratios were similar to those of CYP4F3B.FIGURE 8ω-Oxidation of VLCFAs by human recombinant CYP4F3B at different substrate concentrations.

Both enzymes predominantly hydroxylate the methyl group of the VLCFAs and to a lesser extent the (ω-1) group (data not shown). The ω: (ω-1)-hydroxylation ratio for each substrate is listed in Table 2. In this study, we investigated whether the ω-oxidation pathway may provide an alternative oxidation route for VLCFAs. Our results show that these fatty acids are substrates for the ω-oxidation system in human liver microsomes. Moreover, C26:0 was not only converted into ω-hydroxy-C26:0 but also further to its dicarboxylic acid by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Our previous studies on C22:0 ω-oxidation demonstrated the existence of a cytochrome P450-mediated hydroxylation system for the production of dicarboxylic acids in rat liver microsomes (14Sanders R.J. Ofman R. Valianpour F. Kemp S. Wanders R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The results described in this study clearly show that in humans, a similar pathway is present for the ω-oxidation of VLCFAs. Based on the inhibition studies (Fig. 5) and the experiments with SupersomesTM containing individual human cytochrome P450 enzymes (Fig. 6), we conclude that CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B are able to hydroxylate C26:0. Moreover, both enzymes are able to hydroxylate C26:0 all the way to its dicarboxylic acid (Figs. 7 and 8). CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B have a high affinity for saturated VLCFAs with Km values in the micromolar range and are therefore interesting from a physiological point of view. CYP4F2 and CYP4F3 are distinct genes, and both are located on the short arm of chromosome 19. The CYP4F2 and CYP4F3 proteins contain 520 amino acids, and they share a 94% identity. Both CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B catalyze the ω-hydroxylation of various eicosanoids including arachidonic acid, prostaglandins, and leukotriene B4 (29Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Kusunose M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 345-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These enzymes are expressed predominantly in human liver and kidney, and to lesser extent, in brain, testis, skin, and various other tissues (29Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Kusunose M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 345-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Kondo T. Yamamoto S. Kinoshita H. Kusunose M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the CYP4F3 gene generates two distinct isoforms, CYP4F3A and CYP4F3B, and these proteins differ in tissue distribution and biological function (32Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). CYP4F3A does not contain exon 3 and inactivates leukotriene B4 by ω-hydroxylation. In contrast, CYP4F3B does not contain exon 4 and has high ω-hydroxylation activity toward arachidonic acid (32Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Kroetz D.L. Xu F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38166-38172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of CYP4F3 is apparently determined by the protein domains encoded by exon 3 (CYP4F3B) and exon 4 (CYP4F3A). Our data are in line with this; CYP4F3B has high ω-hydroxylation activity toward VLCFAs, whereas no product formation was observed with CYP4F3A. Biochemically, X-ALD is characterized by elevated levels of VLCFAs in plasma and tissues due to the impaired β-oxidation of these fatty acids in peroxisomes. At present, there is no effective therapy for this disease. Based on the hypothesis that the accumulation of VLCFAs in X-ALD patients may be reduced by stimulating VLCFA ω-oxidation, we have now studied the ω-oxidation of VLCFAs. Long-chain dicarboxylic acids can undergo β-oxidation in X-ALD fibroblasts, whereas fibroblasts from patients with a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder were unable to oxidize these compounds (15Ferdinandusse S. Denis S. Van Roermund C.W. Wanders R.J. Dacremont G. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1104-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, accumulation of dicarboxylic acids has not been detected in X-ALD patients, whereas elevated levels of medium- and long-chain dicarboxylic acids were detected in the urine of peroxisomal biogenesis disorder patients (17Rocchiccioli F. Aubourg P. Bougneres P.F. Pediatr. Res. 1986; 20: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Korman S.H. Mandel H. Gutman A. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that peroxisomes are essential for the degradation of long-chain dicarboxylic acids and that ALDP is not involved in the β-oxidation of these fatty acids. Expression of both CYP4F2 and CYP4F3 has been detected in tissues that are affected in patients with X-ALD. The tissue distribution of CYP4F3B is quite similar to that of CYP4F2 (29Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Kusunose M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 345-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At present, little information is known in literature about the regulation of gene expression of CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B. Many cytochrome P450 enzymes are under the control of one or more members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, notably peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor, and constitutive androstane receptor (18Dickins M. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 1745-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Unlike P450 enzymes of the CYP4A subfamily, which are induced by peroxisomal proliferators and hypolipidemic drugs such as WY14,643 and clofibrate, the expression of CYP4F enzymes either remains unchanged or is repressed (36Chen L. Hardwick J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 37Kawashima H. Kusunose E. Thompson C.M. Strobel H.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Induction studies on the promoter activity of the CYP4F2 gene demonstrated that it may be mediated via retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor-α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α/retinoid X receptor-α (38Zhang X. Chen L. Hardwick J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B predominantly produce ω-hydroxy VLCFAs, and to a lesser extent, their corresponding dicarboxylic acids. Further oxidation of ω-hydroxy VLCFAs can occur via NAD+-dependent alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases localized in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum. This pathway has been identified for long-chain ω-hydroxy fatty acids, retinoids, and (very) long-chain aldehydes in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol (14Sanders R.J. Ofman R. Valianpour F.

Our previous studies have shown that rat liver microsomes readily oxidize ω-hydroxy-C22:0 to a dicarboxylic acid in a NAD+-dependent pathway, and we therefore postulate that the dehydrogenases involved in this pathway may utilize ω-hydroxy VLCFAs as well (14Sanders R.J. Ofman R. Valianpour F. Kemp S. Wanders R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At present, there are no data in the literature on the nature of the alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases that are active toward ω-hydroxy VLCFAs. Future studies are aimed at the characterization of the enzymes involved in the NAD+-dependent ω-oxidation of ω-hydroxy VLCFAs. To summarize, VLCFAs are hydroxylated to very long-chain ω-hydroxy and dicarboxylic acids in human liver microsomes. We have identified two cytochrome P450 enzymes that catalyze the ω-hydroxylation of VLCFAs. Both enzymes are members of the 4F subfamily, namely CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B. Future work is aimed at the identification of the regulatory mechanisms involved in the expression of these enzymes. To generate new therapeutic options for patients with X-ALD, we will investigate whether the VLCFA ω-oxidation route can be induced to normalize the levels of VLCFAs in affected tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2109131504,"The aim of this work was to elucidate the oxidative folding mechanism of the macrocyclic cystine knot protein MCoTI-II. We aimed to investigate how the six-cysteine residues distributed on the circular backbone of the reduced unfolded peptide recognize their correct partner and join up to form a complex cystine-knotted topology. To answer this question, we studied the oxidative folding of the naturally occurring peptide using a range of spectroscopic methods. For both oxidative folding and reductive unfolding, the same disulfide intermediate species was prevalent and was characterized to be a native-like two-disulfide intermediate in which the Cys1-Cys18 disulfide bond was absent. Overall, the folding pathway of this head-to-tail cyclized protein was found to be similar to that of linear cystine knot proteins from the squash family of trypsin inhibitors. However, the pathway differs in an important way from that of the cyclotide kalata B1, in that the equivalent two-disulfide intermediate in that case is not a direct precursor of the native protein. The size of the embedded ring within the cystine knot motif appears to play a crucial role in the folding pathway. Larger rings contribute to the independence of disulfides and favor an on-pathway native-like intermediate that has a smaller energy barrier to cross to form the native fold. The fact that macrocyclic proteins are readily able to fold to a complex knotted structure in vitro in the absence of chaperones makes them suitable as protein engineering scaffolds that have remarkable stability.

The fact that macrocyclic proteins are readily able to fold to a complex knotted structure in vitro in the absence of chaperones makes them suitable as protein engineering scaffolds that have remarkable stability. Although it is widely accepted that the folding of proteins is governed exclusively by their amino acid sequence (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5107) Google Scholar), the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a biologically active protein from its primary sequence remains an unsolved challenge. The importance of protein folding is highlighted by the causes of debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer disease, cystic fibrosis, and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (2Dobson C.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 3Stefani M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1739: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), which are attributed to the loss of biological functions of specific proteins due to their inability to either fold or remain correctly folded. An understanding of protein folding should provide a greater opportunity to devise novel approaches for the treatment of these and other protein misfolding diseases. In proteins containing cysteine residues, the oxidative formation of native disulfide bonds is an integral part of the folding process. In such proteins, conformational folding is coupled with disulfide formation in the process of oxidative folding. Because disulfide bonds play key roles in the stabilization of three-dimensional structures in vivo but their formation in a cellular environment is poorly understood, the study of oxidative folding in vitro offers a valuable tool to understand the complex pathways by which native disulfide formation takes place. In particular, the study of oxidative folding is facilitated by the ability to isolate discrete (disulfide-bonded) intermediates, something that cannot be achieved in studies of conformational folding of non-disulfide-containing proteins. Model studies of oxidative folding of cysteine-rich proteins, such as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (4Creighton T. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 87: 579-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Weissman J.S. Kim P.S.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have established a basis for understanding this process. Most oxidative folding studies reported to date have involved the isolation of stable intermediates by liquid chromatographic purification of acid-quenched folding reactions followed by structural elucidation and disulfide connectivity analysis. The oxidative folding pathways analyzed so far can be classified in terms of the number and types (i.e. native or non-native) of disulfide bonds present in the intermediate species. Interestingly, different combinations of intermediates have been found for different proteins, and it is not clear how the primary amino acid sequence or a particular three-dimensional fold relates to a particular type of oxidative folding pathway. Thus there is a need for detailed studies on specific protein classes, and in this paper, we report on a class where the final disulfide network is particularly interesting in that it forms a “knotted” structure. Specifically, the current study is directed at understanding the oxidative folding process for an intriguing class of cystine knot proteins that also have a macrocyclic backbone (8Mulvenna J.P.

This kind of folding pathway has also been detected for other cysteine-rich proteins that are not cystine knots, for example epidermal growth factor (17Chang J.Y. Li L. Lai P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4845-4852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), hen egg white lysozyme (18van den Berg B. Chung E.W. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. J. Mol.

Stoney K.S. Tsai L. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5203-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The class of proteins we have examined here is the cyclotides (20Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 21Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Mulvenna J. Plan M.R. Trabi M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2004; 5: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which are characterized by a cystine knot that is embedded within a macrocyclic backbone, defining a motif referred to as the cyclic cystine knot (CCK). As might be imagined, the combination of a macrocyclic backbone and a knotted cross-bracing motif makes the cyclotides extremely stable, and they maintain structure and biological activity after extremes of thermal, proteolytic and chemical exposure (22Colgrave M.L. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 23Gran L. Sandberg F. Sletten K. J. Ethnopharmacol. 2000; 70: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As well as being exceptionally stable, the cyclotides are functionally diverse and display a wide range of activities, including antimicrobial activity, enzyme inhibition, and anti-HIV activity as well as insecticidal properties, making them attractive candidates for both drug design and agricultural applications, both in their native forms and as molecular scaffolds for the incorporation of novel bioactivities (24Clark R.J. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 34: 85-93Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Craik D. Cemazar M. Daly N.L. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Given the topological complexity of the CCK motif, it is of great interest to determine how it is formed; i.e. what is the order in which the three interlocked disulfide bonds are made? A preliminary study on the prototypic cyclotide kalata B1 showed that this uterotonic peptide folds to its native disulfide connectivity via a pathway that involves accumulation of a two-disulfide native-like intermediate species that surprisingly is not a direct precursor of the native species (26Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Protein Pept. Lett. 2005; 12: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Daly N.L. Clark R.J. Craik D.J. J. Biol.

Sci. 2003; 10: 523-531Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Given this surprising result, it was of interest to examine oxidative folding in another subclass of CCK protein. In the current study, we examine the oxidative folding of MCoTI-II (Momordica cochinchinensis trypsin inhibitor II). As the name suggests, this molecule is a trypsin inhibitor isolated from seeds of the tropical fruit M. cochinchinensis. It was first isolated in 2000 (29Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5722-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and its structure was independently determined soon after by two groups (30Felizmenio-Quimio M.E. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Heitz A. Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Hong T.T. Pham T.T. Nguyen T.M. Le-Nguyen D. Chiche L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7973-7983Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the sequence and structure of MCoTI-II and highlights the disulfide bonds arranged in a CCK motif. MCoTI-II belongs to the trypsin inhibitory subfamily of cyclotides and is quite different in sequence to the other two subfamilies, the Möbius subfamily of which kalata B1 is a member, and the bracelet subfamily (28Daly N.L. Clark R.J. Goransson U. Craik D.J. Lett. Pept. Sci. 2003; 10: 523-531Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 29Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5722-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is more homologous to a family of acyclic trypsin inhibitors from plants in the Cucurbitaceae family known as squash protease inhibitors. These include EETI-II (32Kratzner R. Debreczeni J.E. Pape T. Schneider T.R. Wentzel A. Kolmar H. Sheldrick G.M. Uson I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Heitz A. Chiche L. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Eur. J.

Smalas A.O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for which structures have been reported both free in solution and bound to the proteases they inhibit. The structure of MCoTI-II is similar to its linear counterparts apart from the presence of a linker joining what would otherwise have been the termini of the protein and forming loop 6 of the macrocyclic backbone (see Fig. 1 for a definition of the loops in cyclotides). The cystine knot is present both in the linear and the cyclic versions of these trypsin inhibitors and is a major stabilizing factor of them. The oxidative folding of EETI-II is characterized by the presence of a native-like two-disulfide intermediate species that is a direct precursor of the native species (33Heitz A. Chiche L. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study, the availability of functionally related cyclic and linear counterparts of a cystine-knotted protein provides an opportunity to examine the contribution of the cyclic backbone to the oxidative folding process of cystine knots. Isolation of MCoTI-II—MCoTI-II was extracted from the dormant seeds of M. cochinchinensis as described previously (29Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5722-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and purified using RP-HPLC. Masses were analyzed using an electrospray ionization time-of-flight Micromass LCT mass spectrometer. Oxidative Folding and Reductive Unfolding—Oxidative folding was performed in 0.1 m NH4OAc, pH 8.5, 0.1 mg/ml MCoTI-II at 25 °C, containing varying concentrations of reduced glutathione from 1 to 5 mm to mimic the biochemical environment of oxidative folding in vivo. For reductive unfolding, purified native or IIa species (0.1 mg/ml) was dissolved in 0.1 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, containing 75 mm DTT at 25 °C. Aliquots were removed at various time intervals and quenched with 4% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were analyzed using a Phenomenex RP-HPLC C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 3 μm) with linear gradients of solvents A (H2O/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) and B (90% CH3CN/10% H2O/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Carboxyamidomethylation—Purified IIa was dissolved in 0.5 m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm Na2EDTA and an excess of iodoacetamide. The reaction was quenched after 1 min with 0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 3.0. The reaction mixture was purified on a semipreparative RP-HPLC (250 × 10 mm, 4 μm) C18 column. Enzymatic Digestion and Nanospray MS-MS Sequencing—The disulfide connectivities of intermediate IIa were determined via trypsin and/or α-chymotrypsin digestion of the reduced carboxyamidomethylated analogue of IIa. After purification to >98%, this species was incubated at 37 °C in 0.1 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, with a protease:protein ratio of 1:20. The digestions were quenched after 2 h by the addition of an equal volume of 0.5% formic acid and desalted using Ziptips (Millipore). The fragments resulting from the digestion were examined first by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry followed by sequencing by nanospray MS-MS on a QStar mass spectrometer. A capillary voltage of 900 V was applied, and spectra were acquired between m/z 60-2000 for both time-of-flight spectra and product ion spectra. The collision energy for peptide fragmentation was varied between 10 and 50 V, depending on the size and charge of the ion. MS-MS spectra were examined and sequenced based on the presence of both b and y series of ions present (N- and C-terminal fragments). NMR Experiments—Samples for NMR spectroscopy were prepared by dissolving the protein in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to final concentrations of 0.5-0.7 mm. The trifluoroacetic acid was used to maintain a constant pH of 2 to prevent the oxidation and/or reshuffling of cysteine residues. Spectra were recorded on Bruker ARX 500 or Bruker ARX 600 NMR spectrometers at a temperature of 290 K. For TOCSY experiments, the mixing time was 80 ms and for NOESY, the mixing time was 200 ms. Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified by recording a series of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra at 290 K over 20 h immediately after dissolution of a sample in 100% D2O and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Two-dimensional spectra were collected with 4096 data points in the f2 dimension and 512 increments in the f1 and processed using Topspin (Bruker) software. The f1 dimension was zero-filled to 2048 real data points, with the f1 and f2 dimensions multiplied by a sine-squared function prior to Fourier transformation. One-dimensional spectra were recorded with 32,768 points over a 12-ppm spectral width. The main aim of this work was to elucidate the oxidative folding mechanism of the macrocyclic knotted peptide MCoTI-II. Put simply, how do the six-cysteine residues distributed on the circular backbone of the reduced unfolded peptide recognize their correct partner and join up to form a complex knotted topology? To answer this question, which is summarized in Fig. 1, we isolated a sample of the naturally occurring peptide and studied its folding/unfolding using a range of spectroscopic methods. The native peptide was extracted from the seeds of M. cochinchinensis as described previously (29Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5722-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and purified over several rounds of preparative and semipreparative RP-HPLC. The identity and purity of the isolated peptide were verified by mass spectrometry. Oxidative Folding and Reductive Unfolding of MCoTI-II—The oxidative folding pathway of MCoTI-II was examined at the level of individual disulfide species using acid quench RP-HPLC. First, oxidative folding of cyclic reduced species was studied in the presence of different concentrations of reduced glutathione to determine its role in the mechanism and rate of the folding process. Fig. 2 shows RP-HPLC traces that monitor the oxidative folding of the reduced peptide at pH 8.5 in 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer with 2 mm reduced glutathione. The chromatograms show that the oxidative folding pathway is homogeneous, and there are only two species that are detected in significant amounts, namely the native species (N) and a folding intermediate (IIa). The native species accumulates to >90% of the overall protein content, indicating highly efficient disulfide formation. We also examined the oxidative folding at a higher concentration of reduced glutathione (5 mm) and found that the mechanism did not change by increasing the reducing potential of the folding buffer. Increasing the reducing potential does increase the rate of formation of the native species but not the overall yield. Previously, it has been shown that MCoTI-II is prone to α/β-aspartyl isomerization, which introduces an extra CH2 group into the peptide backbone at the Asp31-Gly32 linkage in loop 6. The isomerization reaction is accelerated by alkaline pH, and the β-aspartyl isomer of MCoTI-II is separately detectable, eluting before the α-isomer on RP-HPLC. Fig. 2A shows that, during refolding of the α-aspartyl isomer, small amounts of the β-aspartyl isomer are obtained, whereas in Fig. 2B, the complementary reaction is evident; from purified reduced β-aspartyl isomer, small amounts of the oxidized α-aspartyl are obtained. The two isomers have been separated on RP-HPLC, and their structures have been studied via two-dimensional NMR (30Felizmenio-Quimio M.E. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We found here that the β-aspartyl isomer of MCoTI-II follows the same oxidative folding mechanism as the α-aspartyl isomer and has a similar rate constant. This shows that small structural perturbations in loop 6 are not crucial for the folding pathway. The reductive unfolding of MCoTI-II was found to be pH-dependent. MCoTI-II was highly resistant to reduction at pH 3 with 20 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride and did not produce a significant amount of any of the refolding intermediates or the reduced peptide over 8 h. However, at pH 8.0, reduction with DTT easily produced >90% of fully reduced species within 30 min (Fig. 2C). Similar to the process of oxidative folding, the reductive unfolding pathway features the native (N), fully reduced (R), and the intermediate species (IIa) detected previously and a small number of other intermediate species. It is therefore clear that MCoTI-II is not only oxidized via this intermediate species but is also reduced via this species. The intermediate species was confirmed to be the same in both the oxidative and the reductive process by RP-HPLC retention time, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and later by its disulfide content. It was confirmed to be a two-disulfide species by liquid chromatrography-mass spectrometry. Similarly, two other minor intermediates, IIb and IIc, appearing on the reductive unfolding pathway (see Fig. 2C) were found to be two-disulfide species. A mass spectrometric confirmation of the disulfide content of the various species detected in oxidative folding and reductive unfolding is given in Table 1.TABLE 1ESI-MS data for the different disulfide species of MCoTI-IISpeciesTheoretical massExperimental massDaNative (N)3453.53452.8Reduced (R)3459.53458.82 Disulfide intermediates IIa, IIb, and IIc3455.53454.82CM-IIa3569.53568.8 Open table in a new tab Disulfide Bond Connectivity of IIa—It was important to determine the disulfide connectivity of the main two-disulfide intermediate to understand the detailed mechanism of disulfide formation in MCoTI-II. A sample of IIa was isolated by partially reducing native MCoTI-II for 4 min (Fig. 3A), as it was seen in the reductive unfolding studies that, at this time point, the protein exists primarily as the IIa species. The intermediate was purified by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3B) and subjected to carboxyamidomethylation with iodoacetamide. The carboxyamidomethylated species, referred to as 2CM-IIa, was isolated using RP-HPLC with >99% purity (Fig. 3C). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of purified IIa and 2CM-IIa confirmed that IIa is a two-disulfide intermediate (Table 1). Hence, it remained to determine the identity of the missing disulfide bond. This was done by fully reducing 2CM-IIa to a species with four thiol groups (Fig. 3D) and then partially digesting it with trypsin and/or α-chymotrypsin for 2 h before sequencing the fragments using tandem mass spectrometry. It was confirmed that IIa is missing the Cys1-Cys18 bond (Table 2).TABLE 2Peptide sequencing of a partial trypsin digest of 2CM 4SH IIaFragment sequenceTheoretical mass, MWTExperimental mass, MWEMWE-MWTCM cysteines (from MS/MS)DaDaDaCys14-Lys32255.862373.87118.012 (Cys1, Cys14)Asp11-Arg211136.401195.4259.021 (Cys14)Asp11-Lys32572.952690.98118.032 (Cys1, Cys14)Arg10-Lys32729.052847.08118.032 (Cys1, Cys14)Cys8-Lys32987.153106.16119.032 (Cys1, Cys14) Open table in a new tab Three-dimensional Structural Features of IIa—After isolating IIa in high purity, it was subjected to two-dimensional NMR analysis to compare its structural features to the native species. Two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra were obtained for pure native (N), intermediate (IIa), and its derivative species with the two carboxyamidomethylated cysteines (2CM-IIa). The spectra were assigned, and the fingerprint regions for the three species are shown in Fig. 4. The amide signals are well dispersed, and from the large number of cross-peaks in the NOESY spectra, it is clear that all three species have well defined structures. The chemical shifts of the Hα protons of the native species are the same as those reported previously (30Felizmenio-Quimio M.E. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A plot of Hα chemical shifts against the residue number for the native, IIa, and 2CM-IIa species shows that IIa and 2CM-IIa are structurally very similar to the native species (Fig. 5A), with the shift differences rarely exceeding 0.1 ppm for any given Hα in the sequence. The main differences in shifts between the species are clustered near Cys1-Ile4 and Ala17-Ile19. Figs. 5, B and C, highlight the regions in IIa and 2CM-IIa that differ by >0.1 ppm in chemical shift from the native protein and illustrate that the regions coincide exactly with the missing native disulfide bond Cys1-Cys18 and nearby residues. Because the rest of the chemical shifts are similar to those of the native protein, it can be inferred that the two disulfides of IIa are the two remaining native disulfides of the cystine knot (Cys8-Cys20, Cys14-Cys26; i.e. CysII-CysV and CysIII-CysVI; see Fig. 1). Oxidative Folding and Reductive Unfolding of IIa—To determine whether IIa is a direct precursor of native MCoTI-II, the oxidative folding and reductive unfolding of this intermediate were studied. Fig. 6A shows RP-HPLC traces of the oxidative folding process from purified IIa under the same conditions as pure reduced species was folded in Fig. 2A. There are no other species present in significant amounts on this pathway, and IIa directly interconverts to the native species. Furthermore, we found that IIa readily interconverts to the native species even in the absence of oxidative conditions and at low pH. After two-dimensional NMR studies were performed, it became clear that IIa does not have prolonged stability even at pH 2, as after 52 h in the NMR tube, 25% had interconverted to native MCoTI-II (data not shown). This finding has double significance. First, IIa under these conditions is stable enough to perform the two-dimensional NMR experiments needed for spectral assignment (Fig. 4), which take ∼24 h. Second, it is clear that, even at low pH where the rate of disulfide formation is usually very low, the native species is readily formed from IIa, and no other species were present when this sample was analyzed using RP-HPLC. This finding points to the fact that IIa converts directly into the native species. Reductive unfolding from purified IIa features some other minor intermediates that have been previously seen on the reductive unfolding pathway of native MCoTI-II (Fig. 6B). Overall, IIa has a similar mechanism of reductive unfolding as the native species. Thermal Stability of the Cystine Knot in MCoTI-II—One-dimensional NMR spectra of native MCoTI-II and 2CM-IIa were recorded at a range of temperatures to compare the thermal stability of the peptides. Solutions of both peptides were heated from 293 to 353 K and cooled"

In both mammalian tumor and yeast cells that lack telomerase, telomeres are maintained by an alternative (ALT) recombination mechanism.

Previous studies have also indicated that Sgs1 helicase acts in a telomere recombination pathway. Here we show that topoisomerase III is involved in telomere-telomere recombination.

Telomeres are dynamic DNA-protein complexes that protect the ends of linear chromosomes, prevent detrimental chromosome rearrangements, and defend against genomic instability and the associated risk of cancer (1Zakian V.A.

The catalytic core of telomerase is composed of a reverse transcriptase and an RNA subunit. The reverse transcriptase utilizes the RNA component as a template to add the G-rich repeats onto the 3′ ends of the chromosome (4Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H.

In certain human cells, telomerase activity is absent, and telomeres are gradually shortened with successive cell divisions due to incomplete replication, which eventually causes replicative senescence. Once telomeres become sufficiently short, they are thought to lose the ability to protect the ends of the chromosomes from being recognized as broken ends and being subjected to nuclease digestion, homologous recombination, and nonhomologous end-joining repair. Continuous telomere shortening in human fibroblasts leads to chromosome fusions, crisis, and apoptosis (7Artandi S.E. DePinho R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Internal to the TG1-3/C1-3A tracts are middle repetitive DNA elements, called X and Y′ (1Zakian V.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2McEachern M.J. Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The telomeric TG1-3/C1-3A DNA forms a complex nonnucleosomal heterochromatin (11Fourel G. Lebrun E. Gilson E. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The major component in this complex is a double-stranded, sequence-specific DNA-binding protein-Rap1p complex, which includes Rif1p and Rif2p. The copy number of the Rap1p complex regulates telomere length and telomere silencing (12Enomoto S. McCune-Zierath P.D. Gerami-Nejad M. Sanders M.A. Berman J.

Even in organisms that normally rely on telomerase, telomerase-independent mechanisms of telomere maintenance exist. Although most cells in S. cerevisiae (16Lundblad V. Blackburn E.H.

In both S. cerevisiae and K. lactis, the generation of survivors requires RAD52-dependent homologous recombination. In S. cerevisiae, the majority of cells that survive in the absence of telomerase activity have multiple tandem copies of the subtelomeric Y′ element and very short terminal tracts of TG1-3/C1-3A DNA (16Lundblad V.

In a minor fraction (<10%) of the survivors (type II), the lengths of the telomere sequence are increased heterogeneously from several hundred base pairs to 10 kb or longer (20Teng S.C. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8083-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The generation of type II survivors depends on the presence of Rad50p, Rad59p, and Sgs1p (21Teng S.C. Chang J.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1373-1378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The structure of type II telomeres in Saccharomyces resembles that of 10-15% of human cell lines and tumors that maintain telomeric DNA by the ALT pathway (8Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Dalla-Pozza L. Dunham M.A. Reddel R.R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 9Dunham M.A. Neumann A.A. Fasching C.L. Reddel R.R. Nat.

Res. 2001; 155: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These ALT cells display unique nuclear foci termed ALT-associated PML bodies that contain RAD52, RAD51, RAD50, RPA, TRF1, TRF2, telomeric DNA, and NBS1 (27Yeager T.R. Neumann A.A. Englezou A. Huschtscha L.I. Noble J.R. Reddel R.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4175-4179PubMed Google Scholar). Sgs1p and its associated topoisomerase Top3p may be used to remove Holliday junction intermediates in a recombination pathway (28Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 29Liberi G. Maffioletti G. Lucca C. Chiolo I. Baryshnikova A. Cotta-Ramusino C. Lopes M. Pellicioli A. Haber J.E. Foiani M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Therefore, Top3p might participate in solving a topological problem arising from the action of Sgs1 helicase on resolving recombination intermediates. The S. cerevisiae TOP3 gene encodes a type IA topoisomerase that is highly conserved in evolution. Top3p has been previously characterized for its role in a variety of DNA processes, including meiotic recombination, double-stranded break repair, and repair of UV-damaged DNA (30Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of SGS1 strongly suppresses many phenotypic effects of loss of TOP3 function (31Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). On the other hand, both Top3 and RecQ family helicases are required to prevent mitotic crossovers by processing and resolving double Holiday junctions generated in response to double-stranded break formation in vivo (32Ira G. Malkova A. Liberi G. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Cell. 2003; 115: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and in vitro (33Wu L. Hickson I.D. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, telomere shortening has been detected in the top3Δ strains (34Kim R.A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that Top3p might be a general mediator in telomere. However, whether Top3p is a general mediator cooperating with the RecQ helicase to resolve recombination intermediates at telomeres is still elusive. Here, we examined whether a TOP3 deficiency affected telomere maintenance in telomerase-deficient human and yeast cells. We show that TOP3 is required for type II recombination in yeast. The recovery of type II survivors is dependent on Top3p supercoiling activity. In addition, the RIF genes are involved in the establishment of TOP3/SGS1-dependent telomere-telomere recombination. In human si-hTOP3α Saos-2 ALT cells, the heterogeneous telomeric pattern of ALT is switched to uniform telomere lengths. Strikingly, the telomerase activity is enhanced in surviving si-hTOP3α Saos-2 ALT cancer cells. These observations indicate that, in human Saos-2 cells, hTOP3α is required for telomere recombination, which may provide insights into the mechanism for telomere maintenance in cancer cells. Yeast Strain and Plasmid Constructions—All the yeast operations were performed by standard methods. Yeast strains used in this study were the derivatives of YPH501 (MATa/MATα ura3-52/ura3-52 lys2-801 amber/lys2-801 amber ade2-101 ochre/ade2-101 ochre trp1Δ63/trp1Δ 63 his3Δ 200/his3Δ200 leu2-Δ1/leu2-Δ1). The yeast strains carrying tlc1, rad52, tlc1 rad50, tlc1 rad51, tlc1 sgs1, and tlc1 rifs were described previously (20Teng S.C. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8083-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 21Teng S.C. Chang J. McCowan B. Zakian V.A. Mol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 5679-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The TOP3::kanR disruption removes amino acids 6-698 of the 702-amino acid TOP3 open reading frame by the URA3 marker (36Bennett R.J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11108-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Spore cells were serially diluted into or restreaked onto YEPD medium as described (35Tsai Y.L. Tseng S.F. Chang S.H. Lin C.C. Teng S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5679-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to obtain type I and type II survivors. These heterozygous diploids were then sporulated and screened for the URA3 and LEU2 markers by replica plating to selective media. The pRS314yTOP3 plasmid was constructed by cloning the PCR-amplified 3.3-kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment of the yeast TOP3 gene into the vector. The human TOP3α gene was PCR-amplified from pGEM-hTOP3(Cys) (kindly provided by Dr. Ryo Hanai (Rikkyo University)). The pRS314hTOP3α plasmid was constructed by gap repair as follows. The hTOP3α PCR fragment was co-transformed with HincII-HincII-digested pRS314yTOP3. The Trp+ prototrophs were selected on synthetic complete medium minus tryptophan. The resulting recombinant pRS314hTOP3α was recovered in E. coli by yeast plasmid rescue. The plasmids pRS314yTOP3m(Y356F) and pRS314SGS1m(V29E) were generated by a site-directed mutagenesis PCR kit (Stratagene), which mutated the tyrosine 356 of yeast TOP3 to phenylalanine (36Bennett R.J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11108-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the valine 29 of yeast SGS1 to glutamate (36Bennett R.J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11108-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified DNA fragment and incorporated point mutations were all sequenced to verify their accuracy. A mammalian expression vector, pSuper, was used for the expression of siRNA in Saos-2 and HeLa cells. The gene-specific insert specifies a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotide TGACTTCAGTTTCTGGACA, which is separated by a 9-nucleotide noncomplementary spacer from the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence. The sequence was further inserted into pSuper after digestion with BglII and HindIII, and this constructed plasmid was referred to as pSuperhTOP3α. Primer sequences for PCR amplification and mutagenesis are available upon request. Yeast Culture Condition, DNA Preparation, Enzyme Digestion, Gel Electrophoresis, and Southern Blot Analysis—Each spore colony was inoculated into YEPD and grown at 30 °C. Several independent isolates for each genotype were analyzed. Genomic DNA preparation and Southern blot analysis were performed as previously described (35Tsai Y.L. Tseng S.F. Chang S.H. Lin C.C. Teng S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5679-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To examine the DNA from individual colonies, each colony was expanded in 2 ml of liquid medium to obtain DNA for Southern blot analysis. The DNA was digested with XhoI in order to observe the type I pattern or with a mixture of HaeIII, HinfI, HinpII, and MspI four-base cutters to observe the type II pattern. A 270-bp C1-3A fragment was randomly labeled with the random prime labeling system (Invitrogen) and used in Southern hybridization. Data shown under “Results” are representative of two or more experiments from independent spores. Mammalian Cell Culture, Transfection, and Western Blotting—Cells were transfected with the CaPO4 method (Saos-2) or Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) (HeLa) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HeLa) and RPMI (Saos-2) containing fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, nonessential amino acids (Hyclone), and Geneticin G418 (400 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Untransfected HeLa and Saos-2 cells were cultured in the same media without Geneticin. Nuclear extracts for protein analysis were prepared by nuclear extraction reagents (Pierce). Nuclear extracts were loaded on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto an ECL membrane. The membrane was then blocked with 5% low fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies used to detect hTOP3α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), hTERT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as loading control were used at a dilution of 1:100 in the blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS containing 1% Tween, secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature at a dilution of 1:5000. A conventional chemiluminescence system was used to visualize proteins following the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data shown here are representative of three or more independent experiments. Imaging and quantification of the data were performed by an Alphalnnotech photodocumentation system. Human Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol and Telomere Restriction Fragment (TRF) Analysis—Telomerase activity was measured using the TRAPeze telomerase detection kit (Chemicon) with 1 μg of protein/assay system. All telomerase assays were performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice. Genomic DNA was isolated from cells by a genomic DNA purification kit (Promega), and 10 μg of DNA was digested by MspI and HinpII. The digested DNA was resolved on a 0.5% agarose gel and transferred onto a Hybond N+ nylon membrane and hybridized overnight to a 32P-labeled 800-bp telomere-specific probe. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were grown on glass coverslips, growth-arrested by withdrawal of methionine for 4 days, rinsed with PBS, and fixed in PBS-buffered 3% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose at room temperature for 10 min, followed by permeabilization in Triton X buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose) at room temperature for 10 min. For dual immunostaining, we blocked cells with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated at 4 °C for overnight with either mouse anti-Nbs1 (1:500; GeneTex) or rabbit anti-PML (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) Abs. The primary antibodies were detected using Rhodamine Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:500). DNA was stained with Hoechst at room temperature for 1 h. Immunofluorescence was analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope. TOP3 Contributes to Telomere Homeostasis in Wild-type and Telomerase-minus (tlc1Δ) Strains—To investigate whether TOP3 contributes to telomere replication, telomere lengths in tlc1, top3, and tlc1 top3 strains were assessed by Southern blot analysis using telomeric DNA probes. Consistent with a previous report (34Kim R.A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), when the telomere lengths of TOP3 and top3 strains were compared, a small (∼150 bp) but reproducible TOP3-dependent telomere shortening was observed in top3 mutants. This telomere length defect was stably maintained, and the top3 strain showed no sign of progressive telomere shortening or cellular senescence (Fig. 1A) (data not shown). However, the tlc1 top3 cells displayed slow growth and a cellular senescence phenotype (data not shown). Thus, TOP3 partially contributes to the telomere maintenance. In previous studies, we demonstrated that when a tlc1 strain is propagated in liquid, only long and heterogeneous telomeres, representing a pattern of type II survivors, are eventually developed, due to the selective growth advantage over type I survivors (20Teng S.C. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8083-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, examination of the telomeres of the tlc1 top3 strain in liquid did not reveal the type II pattern (Fig. 1B), an observation consistent with the notion that Top3p is important for generating type II survivors. To further examine this hypothesis, we took advantage of the solid plate analysis. On the solid plate analysis, we isolated otherwise isogenic spore products by dissecting heterozygous diploids and restreaking them multiple times on plates until the survivors appeared. DNA was prepared from individual survivors, and the telomere pattern was determined by Southern blot analysis. Significantly, all of the tlc1 top3 survivors (88 of 88) displayed the type I pattern, whereas both type I and type II survivors were recovered from a tlc1 strain (Fig. 1C). These data suggested that type II recombination is blocked in tlc1 top3 cells. Together, these results demonstrate that TOP3 affects telomere length maintenance in both telomerase-plus and telomerase-minus cells. It was shown previously that Rad51p is essential for type I recombination (21Teng S.C. Chang J. McCowan B. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 947-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23Chen Q. Ijpma A. Greider C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1819-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To test whether tlc1, rad51, and top3 mutants could abolish telomerase, type I and type II recombination pathways, strains generated from freshly dissected spores with different mutation backgrounds were examined by serial single colony restreaking on solid plates (Fig. 1D). We found that in sharp contrast to tlc1, tlc1 rad51, and tlc1 top3 strains, which showed a cellular senescence phenotype on streaking plates, the tlc1 rad51 top3 spores could be characterized by microcolony formation from the tetrad dissections and completely lost their viabilities at the first restreak. These results suggest that the triple mutant completely knocks out all three pathways for telomere maintenance, which causes accelerated cellular senescence. Sgs1p-Top3p Interaction Is Critical for Type II Recombination—Previous work has shown that the loss of Top3p function confers a slow growth phenotype, which is partially alleviated in an sgs1 strain (31Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Strains that are deficient in sgs1 also exhibit altered regulation of telomere-telomere recombination in telomerase-minus cells (21Teng S.C. Chang J. McCowan B. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 947-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 22Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. McVey M. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Guarente L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23Chen Q. Ijpma A. Greider C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1819-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 24Cohen H. Sinclair D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3174-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Huang P. Pryde F.E. Lester D. Maddison R.L. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D. Louis E.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 125-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the loss of SGS1 could similarly influence the telomere phenotype in a tlc1 top3 double mutant strain. Freshly generated tlc1 top3 sgs1 spore colonies were subjected to liquid culture analysis. Fig. 2A shows that an additional sgs1 mutation did not rescue the type I pattern displayed by the tlc1 top3 double mutant strain. Examining the 56 tlc1 top3 sgs1 survivors that were generated by the serial single colony isolation, we only observed TRF profiles of type I survivors (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that type II recombination does not initiate in a tlc1 strain deficient in both Top3p and Sgs1p. The results in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2A indicated that both Top3p and Sgs1p are required for type II recombination. In the absence of telomerase, top3 and top3 sgs1 mutants may be defective in resolving the same structural hindrance as in sgs1 cells. Top3p along with Sgs1p may contribute to resolve the Holliday junctions formed during telomere-telomere recombination. To examine whether the interaction between Sgs1p and Top3p is critical for their activities on type II recombination, telomere patterns of freshly dissected tlc1 sgs1 spores containing an empty plasmid, a CEN plasmid expressing the wild-type SGS1, or a mutated sgs1 with the abolished Sgs1p-Top3p interaction domain (36Bennett R.J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11108-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were analyzed. Compared with the wild-type SGS1-complemented strain displaying the type II pattern after several dilutions, the sgs1 mutant-complemented strain maintained the type I pattern (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that Sgs1p and Top3p work coordinately as a complex to resolve the special structure created during type II recombination. Yeast TOP3 and Human TOP3α Rescue Type I Phenotype Recovered from Telomerase-defective top3Δ Strains—To further confirm the role that TOP3 may play in the generation of type II survivors, we first tested the effect of reintroducing TOP3 on a low copy plasmid in a tlc1 top3 strain. Telomere patterns of freshly dissected tlc1 top3 spores containing an empty plasmid or a yeast TOP3 plasmid were analyzed. The reintroduction of TOP3 rescued the slow growth of the tlc1 top3 cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A, unlike tlc1 top3 strains that produced only the type I pattern, this complement recovered the type II pattern as observed in the tlc1 cells. Next, the issue of whether hTOP3 could complement the top3 telomere-related phenotypes in yeast was examined. Human cells encode two topoisomerase III isoenzymes, hTOP3α and hTOP3β, and it is not clear which one is the functional equivalent of yeast TOP3. For unknown reasons, we could not obtain any viable spore over 100 tetrads from the tlc1 top3 plus an hTOP3β plasmid background (data not shown). In contrast, the freshly dissected tlc1 top3 spores containing an hTOP3α plasmid could produce a type II pattern (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the hTOP3α-expressing tlc1 top3 strains exhibit growth rates and cell cycle distributions similar to those in tlc1 strains (data not shown). Thus, hTOP3α can functionally complement both the slow growth and the defect in type II pathway phenotypes of tlc1 top3 cells. To investigate whether the supercoiling activity of TOP3 is required for type II recombination, the telomere pattern was tested using a yeast top3 complementary plasmid containing a Tyr → Phe mutation at the active site of topoisomerase. This mutation was previously shown to abolish the topoisomerase activity (36Bennett R.J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11108-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the liquid assay, we observed that the type I pattern was maintained throughout serial dilutions (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data suggest that the Top3p catalytic activity is essential for the type II recombination and that the hTOP3α may be functionally equivalent to the yTop3p for type II recombination. Mutations in RIF1 and RIF2 Restore Telomere-Telomere Recombination in top3 Mutant Cells—Purified recombinant Drosophila topoisomerase III displayed relaxation activity only with a hypernegatively supercoiled substrate, suggesting that Top3p is specifically performed at hypernegatively supercoiled DNA in vivo (37Wilson T.M.

https://openalex.org/W2057398651,"The centrosome, an organelle that functions as the major microtubule-organizing center, plays an essential role in the formation of the mitotic spindle and guiding accurate chromosome segregation. Centrosome aberrations are frequently associated with various forms of human cancers and it is thought that defects in this organelle contribute to genomic instability and malignant transformation. We recently identified and characterized a centrosome-localized protein complex that is comprised of Su48 and Nde1. Disruption of the normal function of these proteins leads to abnormal cell division. To extend our understanding of how this protein complex operates, we sought to identify Nde1-interacting molecules by the yeast two-hybrid screening method. Here, we demonstrate that both Nde1 and Su48 can associate with p78/MCRS1, a protein implicated in cancer development. We found that, whereas the majority of p78 localizes to the nucleus as reported in earlier studies, a fraction of the p78 protein can be detected in the centrosome. Moreover, we determined that a region containing the forkhead-associated domain of p78 is involved in association with Nde1 and Su48, as well as in centrosomal localization. We also provide evidence that the association between p78 and Nde1 is regulated by phosphorylation on Nde1. Furthermore, abrogation of the endogenous p78 function by small interfering RNA knockdown causes cell death and a modest delay in mitosis. These results indicate that a subset of the p78 proteins comprises a component of the centrosome and that p78 is essential for cell viability."

Employing purified components we show that HP1β exhibits selective, stoichiometric, and salt-resistant binding to recombinant histone H3, associating primarily with the helical “histone fold” domain. Furthermore, using “bulk” nucleosomes released by MNase digestion, S-phase extracts, and fragments of peripheral heterochromatin, we demonstrate that HP1β associates more tightly with destabilized or disrupted nucleosomes (H3/H4 subcomplexes) than with intact particles. Western blotting and mass spectrometry data indicate that HP1β-selected H3/H4 particles and subparticles possess a complex pattern of posttranslational modifications but are not particularly enriched in me3K9-H3. Consistent with these results, mapping of HP1β and me3K9-H3 sites in vivo reveals overlapping, yet spatially distinct patterns, while transient transfection assays with synchronized cells show that stable incorporation of HP1β-gfp into heterochromatin requires passage through the S-phase. The data amassed challenge the dogma that me3K9H3 is necessary and sufficient for HP1 binding and unveil a new mode of HP1-chromatin interactions.

Histone modifications are thought to provide specific readouts that are selectively utilized in DNA transactions or chromatin state transitions (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7706) Google Scholar). Given the multiplicity of modification sites and the diverse chemistries of post-translational modifications, the combinatorial repertoire of this putative “histone code” might have enormous dimensions; for instance, methylation of the five lysine residues that are located at the amino-terminal tail of histone H3 could yield alone over 15 × 103 distinct patterns, while “saturation marking” of all lysines, arginines, serines, and threonines that are found in the same region would result in ∼256 × 106 combinations. Clearly then, even if 1% of the predicted patterns were materialized in vivo, this voluminous “instruction manual” could not be functionally interpreted without the aid of specific de-coding factors. Consistent with this idea, recent studies have identified a set of chromatin-associated proteins that bind specifically modified histones and could, at least in theory, fulfil such a de-coding role. As it turns out, these “effector” molecules are often components of large enzymatic assemblies and possess specialized modules known as bromo-, tudor-, or chromodomains (2Daniel J.A. Pray-Grant M.G. Grant P.A. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A classic example of a chromodomain-containing protein is HP1, a conserved constituent of eukaryotic cells, which, in metazoans, comprises three distinct variants: α, β, and γ (3Singh P.B. Miller J.R. Pearce J. Kothary R. Burton R.D. Paro R. James T.C. Gaunt S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). HP1α and HP1β are localized in compact heterochromatic regions, while HP1γ is more abundant in euchromatic territories (reviewed in Refs. 4Brasher S.V. Smith B.O. Fogh R.H. Nietlispach D. Thiru A.

All HP1 variants have the same molecular architecture: they contain an amino-terminal chromodomain (CD), 5The abbreviations used are: CD, chromodomain; CSD, carboxyl-terminal chromoshadow domain; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; NG, Nuclear ghost; NGE, NG extract; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; LBR, lamin B receptor; D, diffuse; SP, speckled; me1, methylated; me3, trimethylated. an intervening region (“hinge”) and a carboxyl-terminal chromoshadow domain (CSD). The CD is thought to be responsible for chromatin association, whereas the CSD represents a multipurpose binding platform for nuclear chaperones, remodeling factors, and histone-modifying enzymes (4Brasher S.V. Smith B.O. Fogh R.H. Nietlispach D. Thiru A. Nielsen P.R. Broadhurst R.W. Ball L.J. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1587-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 5Cowieson N.P.

Interaction sites are also accommodated in the hinge region, which, in addition, contains a functional nuclear localization signal (6Wang G. Ma A. Chow C.M. Horsley D. Brown N.R. Cowell I.G. Singh P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6970-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although the picture is rapidly changing (e.g. Ref. 7Litt M.D. Simpson M. Gaszner M. Allis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Science. 2001; 293: 2453-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), it is still widely believed that HP1 targets transcriptionally inactive, constitutive heterochromatin by binding specifically to histone H3 that has been posttranslationally modified (trimethylated) at lysine 9 (me3K9-H3). This tenet is based on several observations: first, HP1α/HP1β largely co-localize with me3K9-H3 (8Peters A.H. O'Carroll D. Scherthan H. Mechtler K. Sauer S. Schofer C. Weipoltshammer K. Pagani M.

Science. 2001; 293: 2453-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar); in addition, these two variants are completely de-localized when the enzymes responsible for heterochromatin-specific Lys9 trimethylation (SUV39H1/H2) are genetically ablated (8Peters A.H.

Despite the elegance and simplicity of this model, binary interactions between HP1 and me3K9-H3 do not seem to account for the whole spectrum of HP1-heterochromatin associations that are observed in vivo (14Ahmad K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 494-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). A survey of different organisms, cell types, and chromosomal preparations shows that the HP1 and me3K9-H3 patterns are not exactly coincident (15Cowell I.G. Aucott R. Mahadevaiah S.K. Burgoyne P.S.

In line with these observations, HP1 seems to dissociate from heterochromatin when cellular components unrelated to Suvar3,9 (e.g., the origin recognition complex protein ORC2 or RNA) are removed (20Huang D.W.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3516-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Last, but not least, in vitro binding of HP1 to non-methylated histone H3 and naked DNA has been recently claimed (25Fan J.Y. Rangasamy D. Luger K. Tremethick D.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 655-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 26Nielsen A.L. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Ortiz J.A. Remboutsika E.

Prompted by current controversies, we decided to study HP1-chromatin interactions at different levels of complexity. Purified histones were employed to examine the binding properties of HP1 independently of chromatin state and presence of auxiliary factors. Alternatively, “bulk” chromatin, released from nuclei by MNase digestion, was used to investigate the association of HP1 with native particles of different size and epigenetic status. Finally, chromatin fragments obtained from fractionated “nuclear ghost” and S-phase extracts were exploited to assess HP1 interactions with intact core particles and assembly/disassembly intermediates. Aiming at specific, stoichiometric interactions, we adopted a “μg-scale” binding assay and analyzed HP1-associated histones by SDS-PAGE-Coomassie Blue staining and mass spectrometry, avoiding purposely the use of radiolabeled tracers (in vitro transcribed/translated material) and resorting to Western blotting only when we wanted to “diagnose” epigenetic modifications. These in vitro studies were done in parallel with in vivo experiments, employing transient transfection assays, double-immunolabeling in combination with confocal microscopy, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). The data reveal a new mechanism of HP1 binding to histone H3 and strongly suggest that stable incorporation of this protein in chromatin territories occurs after passage through the S-phase. Cells and Antibodies—Turkey erythrocytes were obtained from whole blood. HeLa, MCF-7, NRK, and MDCK2 cells were cultured according to standard procedures. Anti-acetylated Lys14-H3 and anti-SNF2 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. The characterization of anti-me3K9-H3 and anti-me3K20-H4 antibodies has been described (15Cowell I.G. Aucott R. Mahadevaiah S.K. Burgoyne P.S. Huskisson N. Bongiorni S. Prantera G. Fanti L.

Cell Cycle Arrest—Early S-phase cells were obtained by treatment with 5 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h. Alternatively, we used 3 μg/ml aphidicolin for 24 h, 0.5 mm mimosine for 24 h, or a double thymidine block (19 h in 2 mm thymidine, 9-h release, 16 h in 2 mm thymidine). Cell Fractionation and Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear ghosts (NGs) were prepared from turkey erythrocyte nuclei, as specified (29Makatsori D. Kourmouli N. Polioudaki H. Shultz L.D. McLean K. Theodoropoulos P.A. Singh P.B. Georgatos S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25567-25573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, after three rounds of DNase I digestion (80 μg/ml in 10 mm NaPO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF/protease inhibitors, 15 min, at room temperature, with 200 μg/ml RNase A included in the last digestion step), the resulting NGs were washed in buffer I (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF), sonicated to induce vesiculation, and stored at -80 °C. Extracts were prepared by thorough resuspension of sonicated NGs in 300-600 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitors. After ultracentrifugation (200-350,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), the soluble extracts were collected and either used immediately or further fractionated in 10-30% sucrose density gradients (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 18 h). For preparation of S-phase extracts, HeLa cells were synchronized using double thymidine block, collected by trypsinization, washed three times with isotonic buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF), and resuspended in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml protease inhibitors). Cells were treated with MNase (5 units/106 cells or 1,500 units/ml of pellet) for 10 min at 37 °C, incubated on ice for 10 min after addition of 2 mm CaCl2, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g, for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (F1) was collected, and the salt concentration was adjusted to 300 or 600 mm. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was collected and the salt adjusted to 300 or 600 mm (F2). The pellet was further extracted with 300 mm salt buffer (300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitors) and 1% Triton X-100, centrifuged at 100,000 × g, for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (F3) collected. Equivalent amounts of fractions F1, F2, and F3 were used for pulldown assays. Microscopy—For light microscopy, samples were fixed with 1-4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 0.5% fish skin gelatin. DNA staining (propidium iodide) and probing with the relevant primary and secondary antibodies was performed according to Maison et al. (30Maison C. Horstmann H. Georgatos S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1491-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). BrdUrd staining was done as specified by manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany). Pulldown Assays—GST fusion proteins (HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ or GST alone; ∼15-30 μg) were incubated first for 30 min at room temperature with 30 μl of glutathione-agarose beads, “blocked” in 1% fish gelatin in assay buffer. After washing three times with the same medium, the beads were combined with nuclear extracts and further incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed six times with buffer, before eluting the bound proteins with hot SDS-sample buffer. Other Methods—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed at the Functional Genomics Unit of Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh, UK. Protein bands were digested with R-specific protease. ΔM (difference between measured and calculated masses) was at the level of 1/10,000. Peak assignment was done either manually or using Applied Biosystems programs. Trypsin digestion experiments were performed using 100 μl of trypsin cross-linked to agarose beads (19.5 units/ml) incubated with the corresponding protein (recombinant H3) for 0, 2, and 10 min at 4 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of trypsin and protease inhibitors. The digests were ultracentrifuged at 200-350,000 × g (30 min, 4 °C) and then used for pulldown experiments. SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, column chromatography, and microinjection were practiced according to established procedures. Morphometric analysis and assessment of co-localization of different markers were performed using stacks of confocal images digitally processed and analyzed by Image J. HP1 Binding to Purified Histones and Histone Peptides—To examine the binding preference of HP1, we first assayed total histones extracted from avian erythrocyte nuclei by 0.1 m H2SO4. As shown in Fig. 1A, HP1β-GST precipitated almost exclusively histone H3. Consistent with this, HP1β bound stoichiometrically to recombinant histone H3 but failed to associate with recombinant histone H4 (Fig. 1A, rec H4 and rec H3). Binding to recombinant H3 was tight and easily detectable even at 0.75 m salt (Fig. 1B). Since no significant differences were seen when HP1β or histones were treated with DNase I/RNase A or when stoichiometric amounts of plasmid DNA were included in the assay (Fig. 1C), nonspecific interactions mediated by nucleic acid contaminants could be safely ruled out. As shown in Fig. 1D, “tail” peptides that represented either the non-modified or the me3K9-modified NH2-terminal region of H3 exhibited marginal binding to HP1β at 0.3 m salt and did not compete with the full-length protein, even at a 200 molar excess. However, when H3 was digested with trypsin, a proteolytic product with an apparent Mr of 12,000 was detected in the HP1β precipitate (Fig. 1E, CP). On the basis of previously published studies (31Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. Biosci. Rep. 1984; 4: 365-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 33Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25359-25362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and results shown in Fig. 1F, this fragment can be assigned to the stretch extending between amino acids 40-129, i.e. the so-called “histone fold” domain. Thus, at least under in vitro conditions, HP1β has the capacity to bind histone H3 independently of post-translational modifications, associating primarily with the central, helical part of the molecule. HP1 Interactions with Fragments of Native Chromatin—To study HP1 interactions with bulk chromatin, we used as a substrate material released from G0 nuclei after MNase digestion. As shown in Fig. 2A, when the whole digest was used as input, HP1β precipitated stoichiometric amounts of histone proteins. However, when chromatin was fractionated on sucrose density gradients (Fig. 2, B and C) and individual fractions assayed, we noticed that HP1β bound almost exclusively to oligonucleosomal arrays (nuν) and did not interact significantly with mononucleosomes (nu1) (Fig. 2D). The higher propensity of HP1β to bind oligonucleosomes was not due to “enrichment” in me3K9 histone H3, as documented in the Western blot shown in Fig. 2E. Furthermore, no differences were seen when the experiments were done at 0.3 and 0.6 m salt (data not shown), a point that will be taken up next. Continuing these studies, we then examined S-phase chromatin, which is expected to contain a variety of nucleosome assembly/disassembly intermediates (34Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Gruss C. Wu J. Koller T. Sogo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4533-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were arrested at G1/S with a double thymidine block and then released for 7 h to allow progression to mid-S (Fig. 3A, inset). A “soluble” chromatin fraction (F1) was collected after lysis with Triton X-100 and “nicking” with MNase (mild nuclease digestion was deemed necessary to release detached particles trapped in tangles of non-replicating chromatin). Larger fragments of euchromatin (F2) and heterochromatin (F3) were subsequently extracted from the Triton-insoluble residue by serial washing with 2 mm EDTA and 0.3 m NaCl (see diagram in Fig. 3A). When the F1 fraction was used as input and the assay performed at 0.3 m salt, HP1β precipitated apparently intact histone octamers (Fig. 3B, F1, lane 1). However, when the same experiment was done at 0.6 m salt, the HP1β precipitate contained predominantly H3/H4 (Fig. 3B, F1, lane 2), suggesting that Triton-soluble particles are labile and probably represent non yet stabilized (nascent) or de-stabilized nucleosomes (for relevant data, see Ref. 36Cheutin T. Gorski S.A. May K.M. Singh P.B. Misteli T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Supporting this interpretation, no salt-dependent effects were observed with fractions F2 and F3 (Fig. 3B, F2 and F3, compare lanes 1 and 2), which are known to contain stable, detergent-insoluble chromatin pieces (i.e. polynucleosomes). HP1 Interactions with Intact Particles and Subparticles Derived from Heterochromatin—In combination, the observations presented in Figs. 2 and 3 indicated that HP1β does not bind to intact mononucleosomes released from G0 chromatin but does bind oligonucleosomes and “salt-labile”, detergent-soluble fragments extracted from S-phase chromatin. Since these preparations represented bulk chromatin, not particularly enriched in any single histone modification, we wondered what would happen if the input contained native particles that are specifically modified in Lys9-H3. To answer this question, we used fractions derived from peripheral heterochromatin. In a previous study we have shown that mononucleosomes highly enriched in me3K9 and depleted of me3K4 can be obtained in high yield by 0.3 m NaCl extraction of nuclear ghosts, i.e. G0 nuclei that have been extensively digested with DNase I and sonicated, to release pieces of heterochromatin firmly attaching to the nuclear envelope (for procedural details and mass spectrometry data, see Ref. 29Makatsori D. Kourmouli N. Polioudaki H. Shultz L.D. McLean K. Theodoropoulos P.A. Singh P.B. Georgatos S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25567-25573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When such extracts (DNase-NGEs) were co-incubated with HP1β under different ionic conditions, we observed an interesting and highly reproducible pattern. At 0.3 m salt, HP1β precipitated the four core histones, en bloc with fragments of DNA containing 100-250 bp (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1). However, upon closer inspection, one could easily see that the ratio of the core histones in the HP1β precipitate was slightly “skewed” in favor of H3/H4. This “preference” became pronounced when the assay was executed in 0.6 m salt, at which point HP1β brought down only H3/H4 subparticles that were essentially DNA-free (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 3). The characteristic pattern was not observed when the input material contained larger particles. Peripheral heterochromatin extracts containing oligonucleosomes rather than mononucleosomes could be easily prepared by digesting the nuclei with MNase instead of DNase I, taking advantage of the fact that the former is much less aggressive a nuclease than the latter (37Lee M.S. Garrard W.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 38Cartwright I.L. Elgin S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When these extracts (MNase-NGEs) were tested at different salt conditions, HP1β precipitated equimolar amounts of the four core histones and DNA fragments consisting of 150-mer even at 0.6 m salt. This experiment proves that histone octamers do not disassemble by a mere salt “jump” from 0.3 m to 0.6 m NaCl, unless nucleosomal DNA has been extensively cut (for further details see below). This is not inconsistent with the current literature: the breakpoint at which H2A/H2B separate from H3/H4 and DNA unwraps from the particle lies somewhere between 0.5 and 1 m NaCl (11Bannister A.J.

Since histone H3 precipitated from DNase-NGEs at 0.3 and 0.6 m salt did not differ with regards to Lys9 trimethylation (Fig. 4C), the data presented in Fig. 4A could be interpreted to mean that under stringent conditions HP1β exhibits preferential binding to H3/H4 subparticles. That such disrupted nucleosomes pre-existed in the input material and did not originate from salt-induced disassembly could be confirmed by separating DNase-NGEs on sucrose density gradients at 0.3 m NaCl (Fig. 4, D-F) and assaying different fractions at both 0.3 and 0.6 m salt. As shown in Fig. 4G (lanes 3 and 4), when low density material (e.g. fr7) was used as input, HP1β precipitated exclusively H3/H4 at both salt concentrations. However, when material collected from the middle/high density zone (e.g. fr12-fr19) was tested in the same way, the binding pattern was clearly salt-dependent and resembled that observed with the whole, non-fractionated DNase-NGEs (compare Fig. 4G, lanes 5-8, with Fig. 3A, lanes 1-4). Evidently, HP1β did not bind linker histones (Fig. 4G, lanes 1 and 2) that were abundantly present in the top fractions of the gradient (Fig. 4D). The interpretation we offer to explain these results is presented in the cartoon of Fig. 4H. We argue that the low density fractions of the gradient shown in Fig. 4D contain predominantly disrupted particles (nuD). These probably originate from nucleosomes whose DNA has been completely digested during chromatin preparation (removal of DNA is known to weaken H2A/H2B-H3/H4 interactions and favor particle dissociation; reviewed in Ref. 43Luger K. Hansen J.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We further suggest that the middle/high density fractions are enriched in intact mononucleosomes (nu1) and particles that lack various parts of nucleosomal DNA and are partially “open” (nuO). Unlike nu1, nuO can bind HP1β at permissive conditions, similarly to nuD and non-stabilized S-phase intermediates. “Skewing” in favor of H3/H4 is observed at 0.3 m salt (Fig. 4, A and G), because octameric units (nuO), as well as half-particles consisting of H3/H4, are co-precipitated with HP1β. This becomes more pronounced when the salt is increased, as"
https://openalex.org/W2021461291,"Enzyme I (EI) is the first protein in the phosphotransfer sequence of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. This system catalyzes sugar phosphorylation/transport and is stringently regulated. Since EI homodimer accepts the phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), whereas the monomer does not, EI may be a major factor in controlling sugar uptake. Previous work from this and other laboratories (e.g. Dimitrova, M. N., Szczepanowski, R. H., Ruvinov, S. B., Peterkofsky, A., and Ginsburg A. (2002) Biochem. 41, 906–913), indicate that Ka is sensitive to several parameters. We report here a systematic study of Ka determined by sedimentation equilibrium, which showed that it varied by 1000-fold, responding to virtually every parameter tested, including temperature, phosphorylation, pH (6.5 versus 7.5), ionic strength, and especially the ligands Mg2+ and PEP. This variability may be required for a regulatory protein. Further insight was gained by analyzing EI by sedimentation velocity, by near UV CD spectroscopy, and with a nonphosphorylatable active site mutant, EI-H189Q, which behaved virtually identically to EI. The singular properties of EI are explained by a model consistent with the results reported here and in the accompanying paper (Patel, H. V., Vyas, K. A., Mattoo, R. L., Southworth, M., Perler, F. B., Comb, D., and Roseman, S. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 17579–17587). We suggest that EI and EI-H189Q each comprise a multiplicity of conformers and progressively fewer conformers as they dimerize and bind Mg2+ and finally PEP. Mg2+ alone induces small or no detectable changes in structure, but large conformational changes ensue with Mg2+/PEP. This effect is explained by a “swiveling mechanism” (similar to that suggested for pyruvate phosphate dikinase (Herzberg, O., Chen, C. C., Kapadia, G., McGuire, M., Carroll, L. J., Noh, S. J., and Dunaway-Mariano, D. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 2652–2657)), which brings the C-terminal domain with the two bound ligands close to the active site His189.

The phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS), 3The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; EI, Enzyme I of PTS; EI-N, Enzyme I N-terminal domain; EI-C, Enzyme I C-terminal domain; HPr, a phosphocarrier histidine protein of the PTS; M/D, monomer/dimer; DTT, dithiothreitol. 3The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; EI, Enzyme I of PTS; EI-N, Enzyme I N-terminal domain; EI-C, Enzyme I C-terminal domain; HPr, a phosphocarrier histidine protein of the PTS; M/D, monomer/dimer; DTT, dithiothreitol. is widely distributed in bacteria and has several important roles in these cells, the most general being PTS sugar uptake where these substrates are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane concomitant with their phosphorylation. Indeed, the PTS was first discovered as a sugar “kinase” (2Kundig W. Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and only somewhat later recognized to be a translocase (3Simoni R. Levinthal M. Kundig F. Kundig W. Anderson B. Hartman P. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1963-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The system has been extensively studied and reviewed (4Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 5Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although variations of the basic motif are known, the most general phosphotransfer sequence is as follows. PEP→Enzyme I→HPr→Sugar-specificEnzymes II→Sugars Each step is physiologically reversible except for the last, phosphotransfer to the sugar. The phosphotransfer potential of PEP is 14.7 kcal/mol, about twice that of ATP and greater than any other naturally occurring phosphate derivative. Since the phosphotransfer potentials of the PTS proteins are close to that of PEP, the energetics of the system strongly favor sugar uptake (6Weigel N. Kukuruzinska M.A. Nakazawa A. Waygood E.B. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14477-14491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these considerations alone, it is apparent that the PTS must be stringently regulated, and indeed it is. Even the earliest results on the glucose permease by Kepes (7Kepes A. Cohen G.N. The Bacteria. 1962; 1 (Academic Press, Inc., New York): 179-221Google Scholar), before the PTS was discovered (2Kundig W. Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), showed that when a noncatabolizable Glc analogue, methyl α-d-glucopyranoside, is taken up by intact cells, the rate of uptake declined virtually immediately. Thus, the progress curves for uptake of PTS sugars resemble hyperbolas. These results are observed not only with intact cells but also with membrane vesicles supplied with unlimited quantities of PEP (8Liu K.D.F. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7142-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We originally suggested Enzyme I as a potential candidate for governing the system (6Weigel N. Kukuruzinska M.A. Nakazawa A. Waygood E.B. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14477-14491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This idea is based on the facts that EI monomer forms a homodimer (9Kukuruzinska M.A. Harrington W.F. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kukuruzinska M.A. Turner B.W. Ackers G.K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11679-11681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that the dimer but not the monomer is phosphorylated by PEP in the presence of Mg2+, and that the rate of association/dissociation is surprisingly slow, much slower than sugar uptake (11Chauvin F. Brand L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20270-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chauvin F. Brand L. Roseman S. Res.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12790-12796Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This difference in rates suggests that regulation of sugar transport could be affected by factors or ligands (e.g. metabolites or other proteins) that temporarily shift the M/D transition away from its normal equilibrium value. The extreme case would be conversion of all dimer to monomer, which would stop sugar uptake until the system slowly recovered as the monomer spontaneously dimerized. As indicated in the references cited above, the EI M/D transition has been studied by sedimentation equilibrium, analytical gel filtration chromatography, fluorescence spectroscopy, and more recently by Ginsburg and co-workers (1Dimitrova M.N. Szczepanowski R.H. Ruvinov S.B. Ginsburg A. PeterkofskyA. Biochem. 2002; 41: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Dimitrova M.N. Peterkofsky A. Ginsburg A.

Biophys. 2002; 397: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) by sedimentation equilibrium and microcalorimetry. These reports give the Ka of the monomer to dimer under various conditions and, in some cases, the Ka of the phosphoprotein. However, the need for additional information on the M/D transition is further emphasized by recent findings (16Patel H.V. Vyas K.A. Li X. Savtchenko R.S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17486-17491Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that EI can be sequestered in the cell, results obtained with fluorescent derivatives of EI (17Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4930) Google Scholar). We cannot yet explain why EI, heretofore always considered to be a cytoplasmic protein, can be reversibly distributed asymmetrically in the cell, depending on both the state of the extracellular milieu and the stage of growth of the cell. The accompanying paper (37Patel H.V. Vyas K.A. Mattoo R.L. Southworth M. Perler F.B. Comb D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17579-17587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) describes the behavior of the C-terminal domain of EI. Based on the results described here and with the C-terminal domain, a model is offered to explain the apparent anomalous association/dissociation behavior of Enzyme I. Materials—The following reagents were purchased from the indicated sources: DTT from Fisher, β-mercaptoethanol and PEP from Sigma, EDTA from Fisher, S-300 Sepharose beads from Amersham Biosciences, and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads from Qiagen Inc. Other chemicals and buffers from commercial sources were of the highest purity available. Overproducing transformants were used to isolate and purify Enzyme I and HPr as reported (11Chauvin F.

Chem. 1971; 246: 7023-7033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular Cloning and Purification of EI-H189Q—DNA preparation and analysis, restriction enzyme digests, ligation, and transformations were performed according to standard techniques (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1996; (Greene Publishing Associates, New York)Google Scholar). A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate the active site His189 of EI to Gln. BL21-DE3-ΔEI cells carrying the plasmid pET 21a EI-H189Q were grown to A600 = 0.5, induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm), and further allowed to grow at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were harvested, and the protein was purified by the method used for wild type EI, which yielded a partially purified protein. This preparation was then purified to apparent homogeneity by passing the protein over a 450-ml S-300 Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) system. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 0.2 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2. The sample was applied, and the column was eluted in the above buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 2 ml were collected, and SDS-PAGE was performed. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and fractions containing apparently homogeneous proteins were combined and concentrated. The protein migrated at the expected molecular weight. Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Sedimentation Equilibrium—Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed as follows. A Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge, with an AnTi60 rotor, equipped with absorption and interference optics, was used for sedimentation equilibrium experiments. These were performed at the indicated temperatures, usually 5, 15, 25, and 35 °C using cells with carbon-filled six-channel or two-channel centerpieces (12 mm) and plane quartz windows. Samples of freshly dialyzed protein at three concentrations, ranging from 3 to 15 μm, in 110-μl volumes were transferred to the right side of each cell, with the reference dialysate (115 μl) in the left channel, and centrifuged at three different speeds, ranging from 17,000 to 21,000 rpm for 18–24 h. Absorbance scans at 280 nm were acquired every 2 h with a step size of 0.002 cm at each speed. Likewise, for every speed, Raleigh interference fringes (as described in the Beckman manual) were acquired every 2 h. The following buffers were employed; each contained 0.2 mm DTT to protect the sensitive SH groups in EI: buffer B, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT at pH 6.5; buffer C, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTTatpH 7.5; buffer D, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT at pH 6.5; buffer E, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT at pH 7.5; buffer F, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT at pH 7.5; buffer G, 75 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT at pH 7.5. The pH values given above were measured on the mixtures at room temperature. Protein partial specific volumes for EI were calculated to be 0.7359, 0.7402, 0.7430, 0.7444, and 0.7487 ml/g at 5, 15, 20, 25, and 35 °C, respectively. These calculations were based on the amino acid compositions of the respective proteins predicted by the corresponding amino acid sequence (using the software sednterp, which is available on the World Wide Web at www.jphilo.mailway.com). Sedimentation equilibrium data were fitted, weighted globally to a model of reversible monomer dimer association using “nonlin” software (23Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) and/or XL-A/XL-I data analysis software (Beckman Instruments) and sedimentation equilibrium (24Rivas G. Stafford W. Minton A.P. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 19: 194-212Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Goodness of fit of data was determined by residuals (within ±<0.01 for absorbance and to within ±<0.0006 fringe units for interference). Apparent dimerization constants (Kobs) were converted from either interference of 3.31 fringes/mg unit or of absorbance values at 280 nm to the true concentration-dependent association constants (expressed as molar concentrations of monomer), using a specific molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 24,410 cm–1 mol–1 for EI. Oligomers (higher than dimer) were present at <0.8% of total protein. The predicted (from the DNA sequence) mass of the monomer is Mr = 63,562 daltons for EI. Sedimentation experiments with known and potential ligands were conducted similarly. The ligands were Mg2+ and/or PEP and/or HPr. Potential ligands included glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1,6-diphosphate in the presence of Mg2+ and PEP. Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Sedimentation Velocity—Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed as above. Both absorbance and interference optical detection systems were used to follow the movement of the boundary. All protein samples were dialyzed extensively against buffer C, and the dialysate (420 μl) was transferred to the reference sector. The protein solution (3–15 μm, 400 μl) was loaded into the sample chamber of a charcoal-filled Epon double-sector centerpiece. Following a 1-h temperature equilibration at 25 °C at rest, the rotor was accelerated to either 45,000 or 50,000 rpm, and refractive index profiles with the Rayleigh interference optical system and absorbance at 280 nm were recorded at regular intervals from initial partial depletion at the meniscus until the sedimentation boundary migrated outside the observable radial range. Data were modeled as a superposition of Lamm equation solutions, c(s) with the software sedfit and also globally fitted with sedphat (25Dam J. Schuck P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 384: 185-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar); these are available on the World Wide Web at www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com/default.htm). The sedimentation coefficient distribution, c(s), was calculated at a confidence level of p = 0.68 using maximum entropy regularization and optimizing Fw and the meniscus position of the solution in the cell by nonlinear regression. Fits were obtained with root mean square deviations between 0.002 and 0.008 fringes or between 0.004 and 0.009 absorbance units for absorbance data. The sedimentation coefficients of the monomer and dimer was determined by integration of the main peak of c(s). For monomer and dimer, the hydrodynamic frictional ratio (f/f0) was determined by combining the measured s value with the molar mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. The determined frictional ratios (f/f0) are molecular constants that include the contributions from hydration. Using estimates of hydration based on the amino acid sequence, this frictional ratio can be divided into a hydration and a shape factor, from which dimensions of ellipsoid models were derived. These calculations were performed with sednterp. We emphasize that the f/f0 ratios are approximations because of the assumptions required for the calculations and that discussions of “shape” (e.g. oblate and prolate ellipsoids) are only raw estimates. Whatever the shapes may be, the changes observed when the ligands are present are clearly significant. Near and Far UV CD Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was performed with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Neslab water bath to maintain a constant temperature during analysis. For near UV CD, wave scans were acquired by sampling data at 0.2-nm intervals between 350 and 250 nm at a rate of 20 nm/min at 25 °C. EI in buffer C (17 μm, 1.2 ml) was placed in a 10-mm quartz cuvette. The blank in all cases was buffer C with the respective ligands and was subtracted from subsequent scans of the protein solutions. The final spectrum is an average of 10 scans. The results are expressed as mean molar ellipticity (degrees · cm2/dmol) at each wavelength. For far UV CD spectroscopy, the concentrations of protein were only 7 μm, and the path length of the cuvette was 1 mm. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments with EI purified to apparent homogeneity were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data were collected by following protein concentrations in the sedimentation cells both by UV absorbance and by interference spectroscopy, and typical results are shown in Fig. 1. The effects of the following parameters on the M/D transition were tested: temperature, pH (6.5 and 7.5), the presence or absence of EI ligands, phosphorylation, ionic strength, and low and high phosphate concentrations.

The data were selected from Tables 1 and 2 and are shown here for clarity to emphasize the large pH effect. EI was used at concentrations 3–15 μm. The following concentrations were used: Mg2+, 5 mm; PEP, 20 mm except at 1 mm in the presence of 5 mm pyruvate. The other ligands were as follows: glucose 6-phosphate (G6P; 5 mm), fructose 6-phosphate (F6P; 5 mm), and fructose 1,6-diphosphate (F1,6P; 5 mm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At pH 7.5—The maximum Ka, 7.0 μm–1, was obtained with phospho-EI in the presence of its ligands, Mg2+ and PEP, at 35 °C. The minimum Ka, ∼0.02–0.07 μm–1, was obtained with the dephospho-EI under various conditions, the most important factor being the temperature, 5 °C. The range of values in Table 1 and Fig. 2 is about 350-fold. At pH 6.5—The maximum Ka, 48 μm–1, was obtained with phospho-EI in the presence of its ligands, Mg2+ and PEP, at 35 °C. The minimum value was 0.03 μm–1 at 5 °C in the absence of ligands and in 50 mm phosphate. The marked pH effect is further discussed below. Since it was first purified, EI has been recognized to be a cold-sensitive protein. At the four temperatures studied, 5, 15, 25, and 35 °C, the results were fairly consistent. Ka increased with temperature, the optimum generally being at 25 °C, but in one important case, the phosphoprotein in the presence of its ligands, the largest Ka was at 35 °C. The effect of varying the temperature while keeping all other parameters constant was generally about 10 for the ratio Ka at optimum temperature/Ka at 5 °C. Enzyme I has usually been assayed for activity at pH 6.5 or 7.5. The M/D transition was surprisingly resistant to this change or remarkably sensitive, depending on the temperature and ionic strength. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Under one set of conditions (25 °C, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl), the Ka was 4-fold greater at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.5. However, this effect was suppressed by increasing the phosphate concentration to 50 mm or by decreasing the temperature. The pH effects at 25 °C, illustrated in Fig. 4 show that Ka is 4–8-fold greater at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.5. The remaining results discussed here were obtained at pH 7.5, the pH most often employed to assay sugar phosphorylation by the PTS, and closer to the intracellular pH. Interestingly, in light of the data we report in the accompanying paper (37Patel H.V. Vyas K.A. Mattoo R.L. Southworth M. Perler F.B. Comb D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17579-17587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for the EI carboxyl-terminal domain, EI-C, the effects of the ligands Mg2+ alone, HPr alone, and a combination of the two had relatively little effect on Ka. PEP alone was not studied because of the time required and the possibility of a low rate of phosphate transfer to EI over this period of time in the absence of Mg2+. The phosphoprotein is known to have a higher association constant than the dephosphoprotein. For the sedimentation studies, which were performed over a period of many hours, it was essential to keep the protein fully phosphorylated, and for this reason the experiments were conducted in the presence of Mg2+ and PEP, meaning that two parameters were being varied. As will be emphasized below, the effect of the two ligands on Ka is much more significant than phosphorylation of the enzyme. Dimerization of EI monomer is sensitive to virtually every parameter tested, which means that the dimerization domain (EI-C) must be highly flexible and capable of responding to these changes in the microenvironment. This property is further considered in the accompanying report (37Patel H.V. Vyas K.A. Mattoo R.L. Southworth M. Perler F.B. Comb D. Roseman S. J. Biol.

The β-subunit has a seven-bladed β-propeller structure often observed in quinoproteins. CTQ is the most recently identified, fourth quinone cofactor derived from an amino acid residue(s) constituting the polypeptide chain after the first identified topa quinone of copper amine oxidase (7Janes S.M.

In addition to CTQ that is essential as a redox cofactor for the catalytic reaction (10Satoh A. Adachi O. Tanizawa K. Hirotsu K. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, sulfur atoms of the four Cys residues contained in the γ-subunit are all involved in the thioether cross-links with an indole ring carbon atom of Trp residue (in CTQ) and methylene carbon atoms of Glu or Asp residue, which are chemically very inert. It is reasonable to assume that the multiple cross-link structure contributes to the folding of the short γ-subunit polypeptide containing very few α-helices but mostly coils (Fig. 1D). However, neither the functional role of the cross-links nor the mechanism of their posttranslational formation has so far been elucidated. The genes coding for the three subunits of QHNDH appeared to constitute an operon in the genome of P. denitrificans which consists of at least 5 open reading frames (ORF1-5); the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of QHNDH are encoded in ORF1, ORF4, and ORF3, respectively (5Datta S. Mori Y. Takagi K. Kawaguchi K. Chen Z.W. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Ikeda T. Kano K. Tanizawa K. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14268-14273Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The ORF5 protein is putatively an alkaline serine protease based on the homology search in a protein sequence data base, but its role in the operon is unknown. The ORF2 protein encoded intervening between the α- and γ-subunit genes of QHNDH is also hypothetical but has been noted to belong to a Radical SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) superfamily that includes many proteins involved in vitamin biosynthesis and enzyme activation containing [Fe-S]-cluster and SAM binding motifs (12Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). The ORF2 protein is also encoded within the QHNDH genes of P. putida in the same gene array as in P. denitrificans (4Vandenberghe I. Kim J.K. Devreese B. Hacisalihoglu A. Iwabuki H. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Adachi O. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Tanizawa K. Van Beeumen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42923-42931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Enzymes belonging to the Radical SAM superfamily are thought to catalyze chemically difficult reactions, such as biotin synthesis from dethiobiotin (sulfur atom insertion) through the highly controlled free radical chemistry (13Marsh E.N. Patwardhan A. Huhta M.S. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 326-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Considering that the thioether modifications at methylene carbon atoms of carboxylic acid side chains in the γ-subunit of QHNDH would require an unusual chemical process to activate the very inert methylene carbon atoms, the putative [Fe-S]-cluster-binding ORF2 protein may participate in the posttranslational processing of the γ-subunit encoded in its immediate 3′-downstream. In the studies herein reported we have focused on the role of ORF2 protein in the biogenesis of QHNDH, particularly in the posttranslational processing of the γ-subunit containing the CTQ cofactor and thioether cross-links. As a first step we have constructed a mutant strain of P. denitrificans lacking the most part of the ORF2 gene. The mutant strain did not grow in the medium containing an amine without showing the QHNDH activity, but its growth was rescued by transformation with an expression plasmid for the ORF2 protein. Site-specific mutations in the putative [Fe-S]-cluster- or SAM binding motif of ORF2 failed to support the bacterial growth and to restore the QHNDH activity. Furthermore, the γ-subunit polypeptide accumulated in the cytoplasm of the mutant strain was found not to have undergone any posttranslational modifications. Collectively, it is strongly suggested that the putative [Fe-S]-cluster-binding ORF2 protein plays an essential role in the posttranslational processing of the γ-subunit of QHNDH. Materials—Restriction endonucleases, DNA modifying enzymes, and endoproteinase Asp-N were purchased from Takara Bio. All primers used in PCR were designed based on the nucleotide sequence reported previously for the QHNDH genes (5Datta S. Mori Y. Takagi K. Kawaguchi K. Chen Z.W. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Ikeda T.

A broad-host-range vector pBBR122 and pUC4K were provided from the National Institute of Genetics (Mishima, Japan). A suicide vector pGRPd1 (14van Spanning R.J. Wansell C.W. Reijnders W.N. Harms N.

All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—P. denitrificans IFO12442 was purchased from the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka (Osaka, Japan). P. denitrificans Pd1222 and Escherichia coli S17-1 (15Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Pühler A. Molecular Genetics of the Bacteria-Plant Interaction. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1983: 98-106Crossref Google Scholar) were also kindly provided from Dr. van Spanning and used as a host for gene disruption and a donor for transferring the suicide vector, respectively. E. coli DH5α and SCS110 were used for manipulating DNA and producing unmethylated plasmid DNA, respectively. E. coli strains were grown in the Luria broth (LB) medium at 37 °C. P. denitrificans strains were grown aerobically at 30 °C in the LB medium or in a mineral medium containing 15.14 g/liter Na2HPO4·12H2O, 3.0 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 1.0 g/liter NH4Cl, 0.5 g/liter yeast extract, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2,73 μm Na2MoO4, 1.6 μm CuSO4,20 μm Fe(III) citrate, and 0.5% n-butylamine·HCl or 20 mm choline·HCl. When necessary, antibiotics were added at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 40 μg/ml rifampicin, or 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Gene Disruption—The ORF2 and ORF3 genes of P. denitrificans were disrupted by homologous recombination essentially according to the method described previously (14van Spanning R.J. Wansell C.W. Reijnders W.N. Harms N. Ras J. Oltmann L.F. Stouthamer A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6962-6970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two kinds of plasmids necessary for disruption of ORF2 gene were first constructed as follows. A 4.4-kb fragment of the QHNDH gene covering the ORF1-ORF4 region was amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of P. denitrificans IFO12442 as a template with a sense strand primer, P1 (5′-ATACATATGGTGACGGGCGAGGAGGTGCTG-3′), and an antisense strand primer, P2 (5′-CCGGGATCCTCATTCGTCCCGCGTGAACAG-3′), containing an NdeI site (underlined, including the initiation codon of ORF1) and a BamHI site (underlined, at 3′-downstream adjacent to the termination codon of ORF4), respectively. A 0.8-kb 5′-upstream non-coding region of ORF1 was also amplified by colony PCR using primers P3 (5′-GCATCCAGCATGGCCTGCG-3′) and P4 (5′-CAGGTCATATGCATCGACGTGTCG-3′) containing an NdeI site (underlined). The fragments amplified were separately cloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and confirmed for the absence of undesired mutation by DNA sequencing. A 0.8-kb EcoRI fragment containing the 5′-non-coding region was excised from the pGEM-T Easy vector and cloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene). Then the 4.4-kb NdeI-BamHI fragment was also excised from the pGEM-T Easy vector and cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of the pBluescript SK+ vector carrying the 0.8-kb fragment to yield pKO3. A 4.3-kb ClaI fragment harboring almost all of the 5′-noncoding region to the terminus of the ORF4 gene was cut from pKO3 and cloned into a modified pBluescript SK+ in which a single SalI site was disrupted in advance by SalI digestion and re-ligation after blunting. A 0.1-kb SalI fragment contained within the ORF2 gene was replaced with a SalI fragment of pUC4K carrying the kanamycin-resistant gene to yield pKO6, which was connected with the suicide vector pGRPd1 (14van Spanning R.J. Wansell C.W. Reijnders W.N. Harms N. Ras J. Oltmann L.F. Stouthamer A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6962-6970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the common EcoRI site to yield the final construct for disruption of the ORF2 gene, pKO-ORF2::Kmr. Furthermore, to delete the kanamycin-resistant gene from pKO-ORF2::Kmr, the single SalI site in pGRPd1 was removed before connecting with pKO6. The kanamycin-resistant gene was then deleted by SalI digestion and self-ligation to yield the final construct without the kanamycin-resistance gene, pKO-ΔORF2. To disrupt the ORF3 gene, a BamHI site was first introduced in the middle of the ORF3 gene cloned on plasmid pKO3 by the QuikChange method (Stratagene) using the following pair of mutually complementary primers, P5 (5′-CCACCTCGTTCAGGATCCCGGCTGGGAGG-3′) and P6 (5′-CCTCCCAGCCGGGATCCTGAACGAGGTGG-3′), containing a BamHI site (underlined). A BamHI fragment of pUC4K carrying the Kmr gene was inserted into this site to yield pKO23, which was then connected at the common EcoRI site with a pGRPd1 derivative in which a single BamHI site had been disrupted to yield the final construct for disruption of the ORF3 gene, pKO-ORF3::Kmr. Homologous recombination was performed by conjugation of the donor E. coli S17-1 cells carrying pKO-ORF2::Kmr, pKO-ΔORF2, or pKO-ORF3::Kmr with the recipient P. denitrificans Pd1222 cells (14van Spanning R.J.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6962-6970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which were cultured separately in 2 ml of the LB medium to a logarithmic phase, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 200 μl of the medium. A mixture of the donor cell suspension (50 μl) and the recipient cell suspension (100 μl) was spread onto an LB agar plate. After incubation for 48 h at 30 °C, the cells were collected, and its appropriate dilutions were plated again on LB agar plates supplemented with rifampicin to kill the donor cells; P. denitrificans was rifampicin-resistant. After further incubation for 48 h at 30 °C, clones having insertion mutations at the ORF2 and ORF3 gene loci were isolated using kanamycin and streptomycin (pGRPd1-derived) resistance as a double marker. To complete the process of chromosomal gene replacement, second recombination was induced in the selected clones by growing on an LB agar plate containing only kanamycin. The resulting colonies were further examined for streptomycin sensitivity. The kanamycin-resistant and streptomycin-sensitive colonies for disruption of ORF2 gene were then subjected to colony PCR using primers P7 (5′-CCACAGACAATTTCGACGAGGAGGCGG-3′) and P8 (5′-ACTGGCCTTCGCCGTCTCGAAGCCC-3′), which were designed to amplify a 2.1-kb fragment including the kanamycin-resistant gene. Similarly, a 1.7-kb fragment including the kanamycin-resistant gene was amplified by colony PCR for ORF3 disruptant using primers P9 (5′-CAAGGCAAAGGCCTTTGTCGAAG-3′) and P10 (5′-ATGCCAGGAGCATAAGCGATTTG-3′). The amplified fragments were cloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced to confirm the insertion of the kanamycin-resistant gene cassette inside the ORF2 or ORF3 gene. Subsequently, the kanamycin resistance gene was deleted from the pKO-ORF2::Kmr strain by conjugation using the second suicide vector, pKO-ΔORF2. After similar conjugation procedures, several clones were isolated using streptomycin resistance as the first index followed by using streptomycin-sensitive as the second index. The resultant colonies were subjected to colony PCR to confirm the deletion of the kanamycin-resistant gene. A positive clone with only a 0.9-kb fragment amplified due to the gene deletion was designated PdKO4. The amplified fragment was also cloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced to confirm the deletion. The Pd1222 strain carrying ORF3:: Kmr was designated PdKO6 and used without removal of the kanamycin resistance gene. Construction of Expression Plasmids—An EcoRI fragment containing the region from the 5′-upstream non-coding sequence of the ORF1 gene to the 3′-terminus of ORF4 gene was excised from pKO3 and ligated into pBBR122 to yield pKO11, a plasmid for expression of the entire QHNDH proteins (ORF1-4) in P. denitrificans. To construct an expression plasmid for only the ORF2 protein, the ORF2 gene was amplified by PCR using the above-constructed pGEM-T containing the entire QHNDH gene as a template with primers P11 (5′-ATCCATATGCGACGGTGCAGCGCTTC-3′ and P12 (5′-CCGGGATCCTCATTGGAGAACCTCCCTTGC-3′) in which NdeI and BamHI sites (underlined) were introduced, respectively. The ORF2 gene amplified was inserted into pKO11 at the NdeI/BamHI sites (replacing the ORF1-4 genes) to yield pKO12-ORF2. Furthermore, to facilitate detection of the plasmid-derived ORF2 protein, a hexahistidine (His6) epitope tag with a linker sequence (GGSGGSDHHHHHH) was attached to the C terminus of the ORF2 protein as follows. The ORF2 gene in pKO12-ORF2 was again amplified by PCR with primers P11 and P13 (5′-GGATCCGAGCCGCCCGAGCCGCCTTGGAGAACCTCCCTTGCTGTGC-3′) containing a BamHI site (underlined), and the fragment amplified was cloned into pGEM-T Easy. A 5′-protruding, double-stranded DNA fragment encoding the linker sequence produced by annealing of two phosphorylated oligonucleotides, P14 (5′-GATCATCACCATCACCATCACTAG-3′) and P15 (5′-GATCCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGAT-3′) was inserted into the BamHI site of the plasmid obtained above. Then the NdeI-BamHI fragment was excised and subcloned into pKO11 as above to yield pKO15-ORF2His for expression of the His6-tagged ORF2 protein. This plasmid was also used as the template for site-specific mutagenesis described below. Two kinds of expression plasmids for the ORF3 gene encoding γ-subunit were constructed as follows. A 0.33-kb fragment covering from the Met codon at the newly identified -28 position (see “Results”) to the Ser-82 codon (long version) and a 0.25-kb fragment covering from the original Met1 codon to the Ser-82 codon (short version) were separately amplified by PCR using the plasmid containing a 4.4-kb fragment of the QHNDH gene as a template with sense strand primers P16 (5′-AGGGAGGTTCTCCATATGAAACATCTGAC-3′ (for the long version)) and P17 (5′-AGGTCGTGGCATATGAATGCGCTGG-3′ (for the short version)), containing an NdeI site (underlined), and a common antisense strand primer, P18 (5′-GATTTGCGGATCCTACGACGAGCCTTTC-3′), containing a BamHI site (underlined). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the resultant 0.33- and 0.25-kb fragments were inserted into pKO12 at the NdeI/BamHI sites (replacing the ORF2 gene). Finally, the EcoRI fragments containing the expression cassettes for the long and short versions of γ-subunit were excised and ligated into an EcoRI site of pRK415-1, carrying a tetracycline-resistant gene for plasmid maintenance (16Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar), to yield pKO30-ORF3-long and pKO30-ORF3-short, respectively. Site-specific Mutagenesis—Site-specific mutagenesis in the putative [Fe-S]-cluster and SAM binding motifs of the ORF2 protein was performed using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pKO15-ORF2His as the template and the following pairs of mutually complementary primers (+, sense strand; -, antisense strand) containing mismatching bases (underlined): C131S(+), 5′-GGCTGCAACCTGGCCAGCACCTATTGCTAC-3′; C131S(-), 5′-GTAGCAATAGGTGCTGGCCAGGTTGCAGCC-3′; G176A(+), 5′-CGTGGTGTTCTTCGCCGGCGAGCCGCTG-3′; G176A(-), 5′-CAGCGGCTCGCCGGCGAAGAACACCACG-3′; C427S(+), 5′-GGCTGCAAGACCAGCCGGATACGCTC-3′; C427S(-), 5′-GAGCGTATCCGGCTGGTCTTGCAGCC-3′. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire coding region to preclude PCR-derived errors, if any. The region encoding the mutant ORF2 protein was subcloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of pKO15-ORF2His (replacing the wild-type ORF2 gene). The mutant plasmids thus obtained (pKO15-C131S, pKO15-G176A, and pKO15-C427S) were used to transform the PdKO4 strain for evaluating the effects of mutagenesis on the cell growth utilizing n-butylamine as a sole source of carbon and energy. Expression of the wild-type and mutant His6-tagged ORF2 proteins in P. denitrificans was examined by Western blotting with an antibody against the His6 tag as described later. Enzyme Purification—Plasmid pDS208 for expression of the recombinant QHNDH in P. denitrificans under the control of the cytochrome c promoter (cycA) was constructed by cloning the entire QHNDH gene (ORF1-4), in which a His6 tag sequence was added at the C terminus of the β-subunit for easier purification of the enzyme by an affinity method, into plasmid pRK415-1 (16Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). P. denitrificans PdKO4 cells transformed with pDS208 by electroporation were grown aerobically at 30 °C in the LB medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. A 5-ml portion of the cultured cell suspension was inoculated into the mineral medium (generally 500 ml) supplemented with 0.5% n-butylamine and 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Under these conditions both of the recombinant QHNDH derived from the plasmid and the native one derived from the host cell genome were produced simultaneously; about 40% was estimated to be the recombinant His6-tagged enzyme as judged from the amount of QHNDH activity adsorbed onto a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column. After 24 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the periplasmic fraction was isolated as described below. A nickel nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) preequilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole (wash buffer) was mixed with the periplasmic fraction, and the mixture was stirred gently for 30 min at 4 °C and then poured into a chromatography column. After the column was washed thoroughly with the wash buffer, the His6-tagged enzyme was eluted with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 70 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. The active fractions were combined and dialyzed at 4 °C against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl. After the enzyme solution was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 60 min, the clear supernatant was applied to a Mono Q HR10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equipped on an Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography system preequilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl (buffer A). After the column was thoroughly washed with buffer A, the enzyme was eluted with a 160-ml linear gradient of 0.05-0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. The purified enzyme was concentrated, dialyzed against buffer A, and stored at 4 °C until use. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—P. denitrificans cells were harvested from 10 ml of the culture medium and resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm EDTA·2Na and 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme. The cells were disrupted by sonication (Tomy, UD-201), and the supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min was pooled as the cell-free extract. The cells were also fractionated into the periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions essentially according to the method reported by Alefounder and Ferguson (17Alefounder P.R. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were suspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m sucrose and 0.5 mm EDTA·2Na. After the addition of 5 mg of lysozyme/g (wet weight) of the cells and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (protease inhibitor), the cell suspension was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with gentle swirling. The periplasmic fraction was obtained in the supernatant after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The precipitated spheroplasts were resuspended at 0.1 g/ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA·2Na. After the spheroplasts were disrupted by sonication, the supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min was used as the cytoplasmic fraction. Enzyme and Protein Assays—The QHNDH activity was measured in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 μm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, 1 mm phenazine methosulfate, and 10 mm n-butylamine·HCl as substrate, monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm due to the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (1Takagi K. Torimura M. Kawaguchi K. Kano K. Ikeda T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6935-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One unit of the enzyme activity was defined as the amount that reduces 1 μmol of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol per min. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under the standard conditions (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970;"

Within the repressive chromatin environment, the virally encoded Tax protein mediates the recruitment of the coactivators CREB-binding protein/p300 to the HTLV-1 promoter, located within the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of the provirus. These proteins carry acetyltransferase activity that is essential for strong transcriptional activation of the virus in the context of chromatin. Consistent with this, the amino-terminal tails of nucleosomal histones at the viral promoter are acetylated in Tax-expressing cells. We have developed a system in which we transfect Tax into cells carrying integrated copies of the HTLV-1 LTR driving the luciferase gene to analyze changes in “activating” histone modifications at the LTR. Unexpectedly, Tax transactivation led to an apparent reduction of these modifications at the HTLV-1 promoter and downstream region that correlates with a similar reduction in histone H3 and linker histone H1. Micrococcal nuclease protection analysis showed that less LTR-luciferase DNA is nucleosomal in Tax-expressing cells. Furthermore, nucleosome depletion correlated with RNA polymerase II recruitment and loss of SWI/SNF. The M47 Tax mutant, deficient in HTLV-1 transcriptional activation, was also defective for nucleosome depletion. Although this mutant formed complexes with CREB and p300 at the HTLV-1 promoter in vivo, it was unable to mediate RNA polymerase II recruitment or SWI/SNF displacement. These results support a model in which nucleosomes are depleted from the LTR and transcribed region during Tax-mediated transcriptional activation and correlate RNA polymerase II recruitment with nucleosome depletion.

Although not fully understood, the cellular events leading to the onset of both diseases appear to be initiated by the HTLV-1-encoded Tax protein (5Azran I. Schavinsky-Khrapunsky Y. Aboud M. Retrovirology. 2004; 1: 20-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tax functions as a potent activator of HTLV-1 transcription in part via the formation of a complex with CREB (or other activiting transcription factor/CREB members) and the three CRE enhancer sequences located within the HTLV-1 promoter (6Franklin A.A. Kubik M.F. Uittenbogaard M.N. Brauweiler A. Utaisincharoen P. Matthews M.A. Dynan W.S. Hoeffler J.P. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol.

Tax contributes to the stability of the ternary complex by binding directly to the GC-rich sequences flanking the octanucleotide CREs (9Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol.

These sequences, called viral CREs, are absolutely required for strong Tax transcriptional activation of HTLV-1 (13Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Once associated with the promoter, Tax and CREB form a complex with the cellular coactivators CBP/p300 (16Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These coactivators are believed to participate in pre-initiation complex formation, culminating in strong HTLV-1 transcriptional activation (18Georges S.A. Kraus W.L. Luger K. Nyborg J.K. Laybourn P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The HTLV-1 provirus is integrated into the genome of the infected host cell and assembled into nucleosomes. This chromatin packaging renders promoter DNA less accessible to the binding of transcription factors and therefore represses transcription. One mechanism for overcoming this repression is acetylation of the amino-terminal tails of the nucleosomal histones. This modification is proposed to increase the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA for transcription factor binding (19Hansen J.C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7977-7988Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Hansen J.C. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, this and other histone modifications can serve as a platform for the binding of transcriptional regulatory proteins (22Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7468) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that histone deacetylase inhibitors increase the level of HTLV-1 transcription and that Tax and histone deacetylase complex occupancy are mutually exclusive (23Lemasson I. Polakowski N. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49459-49465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Lu H. Pise-Masison C.A. Fletcher T.M. Schiltz R.L.

It has also been shown that an increase in histone tail acetylation on HTLV-1 promoter-associated nucleosomes correlates with an increase in viral RNA in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Among proteins that carry intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, the coactivators CBP/p300 have been shown to have an essential role in HTLV-1 transcriptional activation. Our laboratories, as well as others, detected CBP/p300 at the integrated HTLV-1 promoter in T-cells expressing high levels of Tax (23Lemasson I. Polakowski N. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol.

This finding is consistent with several previous studies showing that Tax directly facilitates the recruitment of CBP/p300 to the HTLV-1 promoter (16Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5052-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we and others have shown that the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 is essential for strong HTLV-1 transcription in a chromatin context (18Georges S.A. Kraus W.L. Luger K. Nyborg J.K. Laybourn P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Okada M. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12564-12573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using chromatin assembled with core histones lacking their amino-terminal tails and using specific inhibitors of CBP/p300, we have found that CBP/p300 participate in critical chromatin-specific, histone tail-independent acetylation events during transcriptional activation by Tax (28Georges S.A. Giebler H.A. Cole P.A. Luger K. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3392-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These data suggest that, in addition to the core histone tails, another target of acetylation by p300 functions in mediating strong Tax transactivation in a chromatin environment. In previous studies we have examined transcription factor binding and histone modifications at the viral promoter in Tax-expressing, HTLV-1-infected cells (23Lemasson I. Polakowski N. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49459-49465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Lemasson I. Polakowski N.J. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6117-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to better define the epigenetic changes that occur during Tax-dependent activation of HTLV-1 LTR-directed transcription in vivo. These analyses were performed in cells carrying chromosomally integrated HTLV-1 LTR-luciferase constructs in the absence or presence of Tax. This approach enabled direct correlation of histone modifications and transcription factor occupancy with or without Tax expression. We characterized histone H3 acetylation associated with the HTLV-1 promoter and within the downstream coding region. This histone tail modification is typically associated with active genes. Unexpectedly, we found that the level of modified histones was reduced at the promoter and within the luciferase coding region in the presence of Tax. We determined that this reduction was a result of a Tax-dependent decrease in nucleosome density. To begin to investigate the mechanism of Tax-mediated nucleosome depletion, we used the activation-deficient M47 Tax mutant (30Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We found that this mutant is also deficient in nucleosome depletion. However, it is fully competent for the formation of a complex with CREB and p300 on the chromosomally integrated viral promoter. Prompted by the Tax-dependent loss of nucleosomes from the coding region of the construct, we compared RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) binding at the viral promoter in cells expressing wild type or M47 Tax. Significantly, we found that M47 Tax is disabled for recruitment of RNAP II. Interestingly, we also found that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are displaced by wild type Tax and that M47 Tax is defective for their displacement. These data correlate Tax-mediated SWI/SNF displacement and RNAP II recruitment with nucleosome depletion. We propose that Tax, SWI/SNF, and RNAP II each plays a role in nucleosome eviction and transcriptional activation of HTLV-1 transcription. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays—CHOK1-Luc hamster ovary cells (27Okada M. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12564-12573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and 500 μg of G418/ml (Geneticin; Invitrogen). For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, cells were electroporated as described previously (31van den Hoff M.J. Christoffels V.M. Labruyere W.T. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 48: 185-197PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 cells were electroporated with a GenePulser Xcell electroporation device from Bio-Rad in the presence of 20 μg of total DNA. The pSG-Tax and pSG-Tax M47 expression plasmids have been described previously (30Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 32Rousset R. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Nature. 1996; 381: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cells were then harvested at 20 h for luciferase and ChIP analysis. For each experiment, luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) with a Turner Designs model TD 20-e luminometer. The electroporation transfection protocol used in this study produced transfection efficiencies approaching 50%. To enrich the transfected population in most experiments, cells were selected using the MACSelect System (Miltenyi Biotec). Briefly, the cells were co-transfected with pSG-Tax and pMACS 4.1 at a 2.5:1 molar ratio of pSG-Tax:pMACS 4.1. After 20 h, the cells were incubated with magnetic beads conjugated to a monoclonal antibody against the surface marker encoded by pMACS 4.1 and then passed through a magnetic field. Antibodies—Antibodies against p300 (catalog number N-15), RNA polymerase II (catalog number H-224), Brg1 (catalog number H-88) and hBrm (catalog number N-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against acetylated lysines 9/14 of histone H3 (catalog number 06–599), acetylated lysines 5/8/12/16 of histone H4 (catalog number 06–866 or 06–598), dimethylated lysine 4 of H3 (catalog number 07–030), CREB (catalog number 06–863), and linker histone H1 (catalog number 05–457) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The trimethylated lysine 4 of H3 (catalog number Ab 8580) and histone H3 (catalog number Ab 1791) antibodies were purchased from Abcam. Antibodies against acetylated lysine 9 of H3 (catalog number 9671) and acetylated lysine 8 of H4 (catalog number 2594) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Tax monoclonal antibody (hybridoma 168B17–46-92) was obtained from the National Institutes of Health Aids Research and Reference Reagent Program. ChIP Assays, Real-time PCR, and Primers—ChIP assays, real-time PCR, and data analysis were performed as previously described (23Lemasson I. Polakowski N. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 24: 6117-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PCR primers were as follows: HTLV-1 promoter (–349/–81), 5′-AATGACCATGAGCCCCA/GTGAGGGGTTGTCGTCA-3′; luciferase proximal (+708/+804), 5′-ATTTATCGGAGTTGCAGTTGCGCC/AACAAACACTACGGTAGGCTGCGA-3′; luciferase distal (+1527/+1717), 5′-TGAAGCGAAGGTTGTGGATCTGGA/AGAAGTGTTCGTCTTCGTCCCAGT-3′; luciferase Region 2 (+799/+1041), 5′-CGCAGTATCCGGAATGATTTGATTGCCA/ACGGATTACCAGGGATTTCAGTCG-3′; pGL3 vector 5′ (Region 1), 5′-GATCGGTGCGGGCCTCTTCGCTATTA/TCGATAGAGAAATGTTCTGGCACCTGCACT-3′; pGL3 vector 3′ (Region 3), 5′-GGG AGGTGTGGGAGGTTT/ACCGTATTACCGCCTTTGAGTGAG-3′; β-globin promoter, 5′-TCACACACTTGACCCTGTGCCATA/TTATATGCCCTGTCCTGGCTCCTT-3′. Standard curves were generated for all primer sets using 5-fold serial dilutions of CHOK1-Luc input DNA and were included on each experimental plate. PCR efficiencies for all of the primer sets ranged from 89–112% with correlation coefficients of 0.99 or greater. Quantitation was done by comparing threshold cycle values for co-immunoprecipitated DNA to the threshold cycle value for the input DNA in each ChIP experiment as described previously (33Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—CHOK1-Luc cells transfected with pSG-Tax or pSG-M47 were resuspended in SDS sample dye. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Micrococcal Nuclease/Dot Blot Assay—Segments of the LTR-luciferase construct indicated in Fig. 4A and the β-globin promoter were amplified by standard PCR from CHOK1-Luc genomic DNA. The primers used were (see Fig. 3B) (1) –319/–102, 5′-GGCTTAGAGCCTCCCAGTGAAA/CTGAGGGCGGCTTGACAAACAT-3′; (2) –67/+145, 5′-TCATGGCACGCATATGGCTGAA/CGGTCTCGACCTGAGCTTTAAACTTACC-3′; (5) +799/+1041, 5′-TTTCGCGGTTGTTACTTGACTGGC/ACTGGGACGAAGACGAACACTTCT-3′; (4) +1335/+1573, 5′-TGTCAATCAAGGCGTTGGTCGCTT/AGGGATACGACAAGGATATGGGCT-3′; (3) +1607/+1863, 5′-CGCAGTATCCGGAATGATTTGATTGCCA/ACGGATTACCAGGGATTTCAGTCG-3′. A region of the HTLV-1 env gene, used as a control, was amplified from HTLV-1-infected SLB-1 genomic DNA (5′-ACTCTAACCTAGACCACATC/CGTTACCATTTAACTGGACC-3′). PCR products were purified, spotted in triplicate onto a positively charged nylon membrane (3 μg of DNA/spot), and hybridized with 25 ng of radiolabeled total mononucleosomal DNA from CHOK1-Luc cells. Total mononucleosomal DNA was prepared by first isolating nuclei from CHOK1-Luc cells that had been treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration at 37 °C for 10 m) as described previously (34Hager G.L. Fragoso G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Nuclei were exposed to micrococcal nuclease, and the nuclear DNA was extracted and purified as described previously (35Fragoso G. Hager G.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Purified DNA (found to be at least 80% mononucleosomal) was resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the band corresponding to mononucleosome-length DNA was excised and the DNA purified from the gel slice. The mononucleosomal DNA was radiolabeled using the Random Primed Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics) for hybridization with the dot blot membrane. Following hybridization, membranes were exposed to a phosphorimaging screen and scanned using a Storm phosphorimaging device (Molecular Dynamics). Signal intensities for each triplicate were averaged, and the average signal for HTLV-1 env was used for background subtraction. Values for LTR-luciferase segments were normalized to the value obtained for the β-globin promoter. We confirmed that β-globin DNA was represented in the mononucleosomal DNA population by Southern blot analysis of DNA from MNase-treated CHOK1-Luc cells (data not shown).FIGURE 3Tax expression leads to nucleosome depletion from the HTLV-1 promoter and luciferase gene. A, schematic representation of the integrated HTLV-1 LTR-luciferase construct in CHOK1-Luc cells. The positions of the probes used in the dot blot analysis are indicated. B, CHOK1-Luc cells were transfected with pSG-Tax or control DNA (pUC19). Nuclei from formaldehyde-treated cells were subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion 20 h following transfection. Mononucleosome-length DNA was purified and used to probe PCR-amplified regions of the LTR-luciferase construct spotted in triplicate onto a dot blot membrane. Boundaries for each amplicon with respect to the transcription start site are indicated. The left and right membranes were probed with mononucleosome-length DNA from control-transfected or Tax-expressing cells, respectively. C, graphical representation of the experimental results shown in B. The average signal from the HTLV-1 env gene region (negative control; absent in CHOK1-Luc cells) was subtracted from all other average signals. Values for the LTR-luciferase regions were then standardized to that of the β-globin gene promoter. Values were normalized to the signal obtained in absence of Tax (set to 1). The weaker signal from the β-globin promoter (which should have been fully nucleosomal) was because of the shorter length of this amplicon (140 base pairs) relative to the LTR-luciferase amplicons (212–257 base pairs). Use of the shorter β-globin amplicon was a consequence of the limited genomic sequence information available for hamster and related species. Numbers correspond to the LTR-luciferase regions indicated in A.

Kraus W.L. Luger K. Nyborg J.K. Laybourn P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Lemasson I. Polakowski N. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol.

Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4450-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the precise role that Tax plays in mediating these changes has not been examined. Therefore, we were interested in directly comparing histone acetylation and methylation patterns on HTLV-1 promoter nucleosomes in the absence and presence of Tax. To perform these studies, we optimized a system in which we transfected a Tax expression plasmid into CHOK1-Luc cells that carried two to four integrated copies of the HTLV-1 LTR driving expression of the firefly luciferase gene (Fig. 1A) (27Okada M. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12564-12573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Histone modifications at the viral promoter and within the luciferase gene were analyzed using the ChIP assay. Changes in acetylation were subsequently determined using real-time PCR with a primer set that specifically amplified a region of the HTLV-1 promoter surrounding the three viral CREs and primer sets that amplified a proximal and distal segment of the transcribed luciferase coding region (Fig. 1A). Data was quantified by comparing the signal from the co-immunoprecipitated DNA to that of the input DNA in each experiment. The CHOK1-Luc cells were initially developed to compare activation from a transiently transfected versus an integrated HTLV-1 promoter, which demonstrated the importance of using chromosomally integrated promoter constructs (27Okada M. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12564-12573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The integrated HTLV-1 promoter is the true physiological substrate for transcription factor binding and Tax transactivation, as the provirus is packaged into nucleosomes following integration into the host cell chromosome. We have used these cells in a previous study to demonstrate mutually exclusive binding of Tax and histone deacetylase complexes at the HTLV-1 promoter (29Lemasson I. Polakowski N.J. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6117-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using the quantitative ChIP assay, we measured a histone modification typically associated with active genes (acetylation at H3 Lys-9/14) on nucleosomes present on the LTR-luciferase construct in CHOK1-Luc cells. Many “activating” histone modifications were previously identified on nucleosomes associated with the provirus in Tax-expressing HTLV-1 infected cells (23Lemasson I. Polakowski N. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49459-49465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CHOK1-Luc cells were transfected with a Tax expression plasmid or a control plasmid, and samples were analyzed 20 h following transfection. Fig. 1B shows the results of this study. Unexpectedly, we found that Tax expression led to a >50% decrease in the detection of H3 Lys-9/14 acetylation at the HTLV-1 promoter and within the luciferase gene. A similar decrease was observed in a time course experiment examining H3 acetylation levels following transfection of Tax (data not shown). These results indicate that Tax recruitment to the HTLV-1 promoter directly correlates with the loss of histone acetylation at the promoter and within the luciferase gene. We also looked at other activating modifications of H3 and H4 and obtained similar results (data not shown). Fig. 1C shows that Tax expression did not produce a global reduction in the H3 acetylation level in the transfected CHOK-Luc cells. Loss of Chromatin Modifications during Tax-mediated Activation Correlates with the Loss of Histone H3 and Linker Histone H1—The decrease in histone acetylation at the HTLV-1 promoter upon Tax transactivation was unexpected and is antithetical to widely accepted models of chromatin modifications associated with transcriptional activation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the observed decline in histone tail acetylation upon transcriptional activation by Tax was due to a loss of histones from the integrated LTR-luciferase construct. To test this hypothesis, we used the ChIP assay to analyze histone H3 binding in the absence and presence of Tax. The antibody used in these experiments recognizes the carboxyl-terminal region of histone H3, which lacks sites of post-translational modification and should provide a constitutively available epitope. Using this antibody, we showed that the level of histone H3 associated with the HTLV-1 promoter was reduced by nearly 50% during Tax transactivation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the level of histone H3 detected within the proximal region of the luciferase gene was reduced in the presence of Tax. We also examined the binding of linker histone H1 in parallel experiments. Similar to our observations with H3, histone H1 binding at the HTLV-1 LTR and within the luciferase gene decreased following transfection of Tax into the CHOK1-Luc cells (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that the observed Tax-dependent reduction in activating histone modifications is because of a loss of core histones and H1 and thus intact nucleosomes from the LTR-luciferase construct. Our data do not support the replacement of H3 with the transcription-associated variant histone H3.3, as the H3 antibody recognizes both of these histones. In these experiments, the data were standardized against histones H3 and H1 measured at the transcriptionally silent β-globin promoter. We found that Tax expression had no effect on the level of H3 and H1 at the β-globin promoter (Fig. 2C). This control was not feasible in our examination of histone acetylation described in Fig. 1, as activating modifications were undetectable at the β-globin promoter (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2049980464,"Aneuploidy is a fundamental principle of many cancer cells and is mostly related to defects in mitotic segregation of chromosomes. Many solid tumors as well as some preneoplastic lesions have been shown to contain polyploid chromosome numbers. The exact mechanisms behind whole-genome duplications are not known but have been linked to compromised mitotic checkpoint genes. We now report that the telomere checkpoint plays a key role for polyploidy in colon cancer cells. Telomerase suppression by a dominant-negative mutant of hTERT and consecutive telomere dysfunction in wild-type HCT116 colon cancer cells resulted in only minor stable chromosomal alterations. However, higher ploidy levels with up to 350 chromosomes were found when the cell-cycle checkpoint proteins p53 or p21 were absent. These findings indicate that telomere dysfunction in the absence of cell-cycle control may explain the high frequency of alterations in chromosome numbers found in many solid tumors."

Although a defined biochemical activity has yet to be assigned to TDE1/TMS family members, previous results point to the overexpression of family members in tumor cell lines or tissues. To define whether hTDE1 may directly impact on neoplastic transformation, we derived and characterized stable Rat-1 transfectants that constitutively express hTDE1 at the plasma membrane. Expression of hTDE1 in Rat-1 transfectants had a significant effect on cell contact inhibition in vitro as judged by a focus formation assay. In addition, by monitoring caspase-3 activity and Hoechst staining, we determined that hTDE1 overexpression partially protects cells from serum starvation- and etoposide-induced apoptosis. Finally, hTDE1 Rat-1-expressing clones accelerated the formation of tumors in a nude mouse assay. Our results suggest that hTDE1 contributes directly to oncogenesis in vivo that may in part be explained by its effect on apoptosis in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2044387929,"The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) mediates uptake/phosphorylation of sugars. The transport of all PTS sugars requires Enzyme I (EI) and a phosphocarrier histidine protein of the PTS (HPr). The PTS is stringently regulated, and a potential mechanism is the monomer/dimer transition of EI, because only the dimer accepts the phosphoryl group from PEP. EI monomer consists of two major domains, at the N and C termini (EI-N and EI-C, respectively). EI-N accepts the phosphoryl group from phospho-HPr but not PEP. However, it is phosphorylated by PEP(Mg2+) when complemented with EI-C. Here we report that the phosphotransfer rate increases ∼25-fold when HPr is added to a mixture of EI-N, EI-C, and PEP(Mg2+). A model to explain this effect is offered. Sedimentation equilibrium results show that the association constant for dimerization of EI-C monomers is 260-fold greater than the Ka for native EI. The ligands have no detectable effect on the secondary structure of the dimer (far UV CD) but have profound effects on the tertiary structure as determined by near UV CD spectroscopy, thermal denaturation, sedimentation equilibrium and velocity, and intrinsic fluorescence of the 2 Trp residues. The binding of PEP requires Mg2+. For example, there is no effect of PEP on the Tm, an increase of 7 °C in the presence of Mg2+, and ∼14 °C when both are present.

There are many variants of the PTS, but all of them require the first two proteins in the phosphotransfer process, Enzyme I (EI) and the low molecular weight phosphocarrier protein, HPr. The first two steps in the reaction sequence are depicted in Reactions 1 and 2. PEP(Mg2+)+EI⇄pyruvate+P-EI(Eq. 1) P-EI+HPr⇄P-HPr+EI(Eq. 2) The phosphoryl group is then transferred from P-HPr to the sugar-specific proteins. The properties of EI have been reviewed previously (4Chauvin F. Brand L. Roseman S. Res. Microbiol. 1996; 147: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Ginsburg A. Peterkofsky A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As discussed in an earlier report (6Weigel N. Kukuruzinska M.A. Nakazawa A. Waygood E.B. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14477-14491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the phosphotransfer potential of PEP is so high that the PTS must be stringently regulated or cells would burst with accumulated sugar phosphate. One potential mechanism for this regulation is dependent on the properties of the monomer/dimer transition of EI. The dimer accepts the phosphoryl group from PEP, whereas the monomer does not, and association/dissociation is a very slow process relative to the phosphotransfer reactions. A report on the kinetics of EI phosphorylation and dimerization has recently been published (7Meadow N.D. Mattoo R.L. Savtchenko R.S. Roseman S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12790-12796Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the hydrodynamic properties of the monomer/dimer transition are described in the companion paper (36Patel H.V. Vyas K.A. Savtchenko R.S. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17570-17578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Early work on thermal unfolding of EI, using high sensitivity scanning calorimetry and partial proteolysis, showed that the monomer consisted of two major domains (8LiCalsi C. Crocenzi T.S. Freire E. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19519-19527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), EI-N, the N-terminal, and EI-C, the C-terminal domain. Each consists of about half the molecule, and a short linker polypeptide chain. EI-C is flexible and protease-sensitive, whereas EI-N is compact and protease-resistant. EI-N isolated after proteolysis of intact EI was not phosphorylated by PEP but did react with phospho-HPr, and the same result was obtained with molecularly cloned EI-N (9Chauvin F. Fomenkov A. Johnson C.R. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

P-HPr+EI-N⇔P-EI-N+HPr(Eq. 3) EI-N did not dimerize and yielded a binding or association constant (9Chauvin F. Fomenkov A. Johnson C.R. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HPr+EI-N⇔[HPr·EI-N](Eq. 4) This value is similar to that obtained with intact EI and HPr (1.1 × 105 m–1). Finally, EI-N has been crystallized and its structure (10Liao D.-I. Silverton E. Seok Y.-J.

Topographically, it resembles an ellipsoid 66 Å long, 16–26 Å wide, and contains two subdomains. One is superposable (topologically) over a subdomain of pyruvate phosphate dikinase, which is also phosphorylated by PEP on a His residue (11Herzberg O. Chen C.C. Kapadia G. McGuire M. Carroll L.J.

The similarity to pyruvate phosphate dikinase is striking in that the active-site residues in the empty PEP binding domain of the EI-C adopt almost identical conformations as the liganded PEP-binding sites of pyruvate phosphate dikinase (11Herzberg O. Chen C.C. Kapadia G. McGuire M. Carroll L.J. Noh S.J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2652-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 12Herzberg O. Chen C.C. Liu S.

Structural proposals can be made for the E. coli EI-C from the above crystal structure. However, as reported here and in earlier work, the crystal structure represents one of what must be many conformers of EI-C (see “Discussion” the companion paper (36Patel H.V. Vyas K.A. Savtchenko R.S. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17570-17578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)). Some other important properties of E. coli EI-C can be summarized as follows: (a) EI-C was molecularly cloned (17Fomenkov A. Valiakhmetov A. Brand L. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8491-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and shown to complement EI-N, both in vitro and in vivo. That is, EI-N was phosphorylated in the presence of EI-C, PEP, and Mg2+ (Reaction 5). PEP(Mg2+)+EI-N+[EI-C]⇄pyruvate+P-EI-N+[EI-C](Eq. 5) The kinetics of this system are presented here, with special emphasis on the effects of HPr. (b) EI-C is an acidic polypeptide (amino acids 256–575 of EI, 35,633 Da), containing 52 acidic and 37 basic residues. The calculated pI = 4.87, and it has a net charge of –15 at pH 7. (c) The 4 Cys and 2 Trp residues of EI are located in EI-C. The C terminus of EI is a Cys. The three internal SH groups are required for dimerization, whereas the C-terminal SH is not (18Han M.K. Walbridge D.G. Knutson J.R. Brand L. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Han M.K. Roseman S. Brand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1985-1995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization does not involve formation of –S–S–bonds between the Cys residues. For the present purposes, the rates of reaction of the three internal Cys-SH groups with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (18Han M.K. Walbridge D.G. Knutson J.R. Brand L. Roseman S. Anal.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1985-1995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are of special interest. They change markedly in the presence of EI ligands (PEP, Mg2+, or HPr), thus illustrating, even in these early reports, that the EI-C domain adopts multiple configurations. The present studies are concerned with determining the association constant of the EI-C monomers, its interactions with the two ligands Mg2+ and PEP, and their effects on some important properties of the polypeptide. In addition, we report the effect of HPr on the kinetics of phosphorylation of EI-N by mixtures of EI-C, PEP, and Mg2+. Materials and Methods—The following reagents were purchased from the indicated sources: DTT from Fisher Biotech, β-mercaptoethanol and PEP from Sigma, and EDTA from Fisher Scientific. Other chemicals and buffers from commercial sources were the highest purity available. The New England Biolabs IMPACT system, used for isolation of EI-C, is briefly described below. Overproducing transformants were used to isolate and purify Enzyme I, HPr and EI-N as reported (9Chauvin F. Fomenkov A. Johnson C.R. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The buffers used were as follows: buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA), buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm DTT), buffer C (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm DTT), buffer D (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm DTT), buffer E (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm DTT), and buffer F (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT). Molecular Cloning and Isolation of EI-C—Unlike the other cytoplasmic PTS proteins (EI, HPr, and IIAGlc), and EI-N, which are relatively easy to molecularly clone, overexpress, and, therefore, to isolate in sufficient quantity, EI-C proved to be exceedingly difficult to isolate. We made several attempts to use commercial fusion protein systems in which the DNA encoding EI-C (amino acids 256–575 of EI) was fused with genes that specified marker proteins used for purification (e.g. maltose- and chitin-binding proteins). The marker protein was then cleaved from the desired product, such as EI-C, with a protease specific for the peptide linking the two fused proteins. We were unsuccessful in these attempts because EI-C is especially protease-sensitive, although it lacks the amino acid peptide sequences supposedly required by the specific proteases. Success was finally achieved using the “IMPACT” system of New England Biolabs. This is an intein system that is used to splice, post-translationally, two fused proteins or, as in the present case, to isolate a protein in one step (see Ref. 24Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar and www.neb.com/neb/inteins.html). The strategy is to start with a construct encoding the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar ATPase Subunit A intein with an embedded chitin-binding domain. This DNA sequence is then fused to the sequence that encodes EI-C at the C terminus of the intein. The fused protein binds to chitin beads and is thoroughly washed. In the presence of thiols such as DTT, the intein undergoes specific self-cleavage, which releases the target protein from the intein tag attached to the column of chitin beads. Cells (BL21-DE3-DEI) harboring plasmid pTYB11-E1C were grown in 500 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin 75 μg/ml, at 37 °C with shaking to an A600 of 0.48 and then induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for 15 h at 15 °C. The cells were harvested, washed twice with and resuspended in 40 ml of column buffer A. Cells were lysed in the French Press, DNA was precipitated with streptomycin sulfate, and the suspension was centrifuged (200,000 × g) to remove debris. The supernatant was diluted to a final volume of 75 ml and transferred at 1 ml/min to a 12-ml chitin (fresh beads) column equilibrated with 100 ml of buffer A at 4 °C. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A to remove nonspecific protein and flushed with 30 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm DTT (buffer B). The volume of buffer B above the resin was adjusted to 2 ml, and the column was maintained for 18 h at room temperature during which the conjugated protein is cleaved by the intein system and releases EI-C. The column was then allowed to equilibrate to 4 °C, and the cleaved protein was eluted with buffer B at 1 ml/min. Fractions (4 ml) were collected. EI-C was found in the first four to five fractions. SDS-PAGE was performed to detect protein in the fractions, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Sedimentation Equilibrium—A Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with an AnTi60 rotor, equipped with absorption and interference optics, was used for sedimentation equilibrium experiments. These were performed at 5 °C and 25 °C using cells with carbon-filled six- or two-channel centerpieces (12 mm) and plane quartz windows. Samples of freshly dialyzed protein at 3–15 μm concentrations in 110-μl volumes were loaded into the right side of each cell, with the reference dialysate (115 μl) in the left channel, and centrifuged at different speeds, 17,000, 19,000, and 21,000 rpm for 18–24 h. Absorbance scans at 280 nm were acquired with a step size 0.002 cm at each speed. Likewise, for every speed, Raleigh interference fringes (as described in the Beckman manual) were acquired every 2 h. EI-C was in buffer C or buffer D. The effects of ligands such as Mg2+ and/or PEP at the indicated concentrations were studied under the same conditions. Protein-specific volumes were calculated to be 0.7328 and 0.7413 ml/g at 5 °C and 25 °C, respectively, based on the amino acid composition of EI-C predicted by the corresponding DNA sequence (using the software sednterp, which is available at www.jphilo.mailway.com). Sedimentation equilibrium data were fitted and weighted globally to a model of reversible monomer dimer association using software “nonlin” (25Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) and/or XL-A/XL-I data analysis software, by Beckman Instruments Inc., and “Sedimentation equilibrium” (26Rivas G. Stafford W. Minton A.P. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 19: 194-212Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Goodness of fit of data were determined by residuals (within less then ±0.01 for absorbance and to within less then ±0.0006 fringe units for interference). Apparent dimerization constants (Kobs) were converted from either interference of 3.31 fringes/mg unit or of absorbance values at 280 nm to the true concentration-dependent association constants (expressed as molar concentrations of monomer) using a specific molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 19,540 cm–1 mol–1. Oligomers (higher than dimer) were present at <0.8% of total protein. The predicted (from the DNA sequence) mass of the monomer is 35,633 Da. Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Sedimentation Velocity—Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed as above. Both absorbance and interference optical detection systems were used to follow the movement of the boundary. All protein samples were dialyzed extensively against buffer C, and the dialysate (420 μl) was transferred to the reference sector. The protein solution (3–15 μm, 400 μl) was loaded into the sample chamber of a charcoal-filled Epon double-sector centerpiece. Following a 1-h temperature equilibration at 25 °C at rest, the rotor was accelerated to either 50,000 or 52,000 rpm, and refractive index profiles with the Rayleigh interference optical system and absorbance at 280 nm were recorded at regular intervals from initial partial depletion at the meniscus until the sedimentation boundary migrated outside the observable radial range. Data were modeled as a superposition of Lamm equation solutions, c(s) with the software sedfit and also globally fitted with sedphat (27Dam J. Schuck P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 384: 185-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 28Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar) (both are available at www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com/default.htm). The sedimentation coefficient distribution c(s) was calculated at a confidence level of p = 0.68 using maximum entropy regularization, and optimizing parameters and the meniscus position of the solution in the cell by nonlinear regression. Fits were obtained with root mean square deviations between 0.004 and 0.008 fringes or between 0.005 and 0.009 au for absorbance data. The sedimentation coefficients of the monomer and dimer were determined by integration of the main peak of c(s). For monomer and dimer, the hydrodynamic frictional ratio (f/f0) was determined by combining the measured s-value with the molar mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. The determined frictional ratios (f/f0) are molecular constants that include the contributions from hydration. Using estimates of hydration based on the amino acid sequence this frictional ratio can be divided into a hydration and a shape factor, from which dimensions of ellipsoid models were derived. These calculations were performed with sednterp. Far UV CD Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was performed with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Neslab water bath to maintain a constant temperature during analysis. Wave scans were acquired by sampling data at 0.2 nm intervals between 250 and 190 nm at a rate of 20 nm/min at 25 °C. Each spectrum represents an average of five scans. The solution contained the following components: EI-C (7 μm) and the specified ligand in buffer C, which was transferred to a 1-mm quartz cuvette. For “melting” curves, the minima at 222 nm was selected for monitoring the loss of α-helix as a function of temperature. The temperature was increased from 20 to 90 °C in steps of 1 °C per minute with 1-min intervals between steps for equilibration. Non-linear least squares fitting was used to determine the Tm from the melting curves. Near UV CD Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was performed on the same instrument as above. Wave scans were acquired by sampling data at 0.2 nm intervals between 350 and 250 nm at a rate of 20 nm/min at 25 °C. Protein in buffer C (36 μm, 1.2 ml) was loaded into a 10-mm quartz cuvette. The blank in all cases was buffer C containing the respective ligands, and the resulting spectra were subtracted from subsequent scans of the protein solutions. Each spectrum is an average of ten scans. The results are expressed as mean molar ellipticity (deg·cm2/dmol) at each wavelength. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed with an SLM Aminco spectrofluorometer. Spectra of EI-C (5 μm) in buffer E at 25 °C in the presence of the indicated ligand were acquired with polarizers positioned at 54.7° in the excitation light beam (4 nm bandwidth). Changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity were monitored as a function of ligand concentration. The excitation wavelength was set at 291 nm (4 nm bandwidth), and emission was at 338 nm (4 nm bandwidth). Temperature was controlled by a programmable Neslab water bath using a water-jacketed turret containing the cuvettes (1 ml, with 1-cm path length). Samples in the cuvettes were stirred using a magnetic stirrer. Data were fit using non-linear least squares to the Adair equation to obtain KD values. Stoichiometry of binding of Mg2+ to EI-C was estimated by fitting the data to a model of the dimer containing one, two, and four binding sites. Goodness of fit was determined using chi2, residuals, and visual examination of curves. Of the models tested, that with two binding sites/monomer of unequal magnitude produced the best fit (see “Results”) for binding to Mg2+. PEP titration was performed in the absence and presence of Mg2+ (5 mm) by monitoring change in relative fluorescence intensity at 338 nm as the PEP concentration was varied. Lactate Dehydrogenase Assays for PEP-dependent Protein Phosphorylation—When PEP phosphorylates a PTS protein, the kinetics of formation of one of the products, pyruvate, can be followed continuously using a coupled assay with lactate dehydrogenase and NADH (29Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of EI-C (5 μm), PEP (5 mm), with or without EI-N (7 or 11.7 μm), LDH (8 units), NADH (0.150 mm), in buffer F was placed in a cuvette (total volume, 200 μl) at 25 °C, and absorbance was monitored at 340 nm for ∼20 min. Readings were taken every 0.1 s. HPr was added either at the start (14 μm final concentration) of the reaction or at the indicated time (8.1 μm). Determination of Phosphoprotein Synthesis Using [32P]PEP—[32P]PEP was synthesized and stored as reported (31Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). EI-C (0.5–5 μm as indicated) and [32P]PEP (2 mm) in 50 μl of buffer F were first incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was started by adding EI-N (5.85–11.7 μm) and/or HPr (8.1 μm) at the indicated concentration; the total volume was 100 μl. Having determined in preliminary experiments that phosphorylation of EI-N with EI-C was slow (in minutes), the proteins were hand mixed rather than in a rapid quench apparatus (7Meadow N.D. Mattoo R.L. Savtchenko R.S. Roseman S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12790-12796Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by adding 50 μl of quench solution (5 m urea plus 3 m KOH). Phosphoproteins were separated on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) by injecting 105 μl of the quenched reaction mixture at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in buffer containing 3 m urea plus 35 mm Na3PO4, pH 11. Fractions of separated phosphoproteins (1.1 ml) were collected after 6 min, and the 32P was determined by using a Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer Counter (Beckman). Sedimentation Equilibrium Studies with EI-C—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” EI-C, purified to apparent homogeneity, aggregated at low ionic strength, i.e. at NaCl concentrations below 50 mm, and was also sensitive to air oxidation of the SH groups. However, the protein was stable in solution under a variety of conditions when maintained in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA (buffer C). Unless otherwise specified, these were the conditions used for the experiments described below. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at three concentrations of the protein, ranging from 3 to 15 μm, at 5 and 25 °C, at three speeds (Fig. 1, see “Materials and Methods”) and in the presence and absence of Mg2+ (5 mm) or of Mg2+ (5 mm) and PEP (10 mm). The following conclusions can be drawn from data in Table 1 and in the accompanying report (36Patel H.V. Vyas K.A. Savtchenko R.S. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17570-17578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) on intact EI. 1) The same trends were observed with EI-C as with intact EI (36Patel H.V. Vyas K.A. Savtchenko R.S. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17570-17578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). That is, Ka increased with temperature, increased further in the presence of Mg2+, and increased yet again when both Mg2+ and PEP were present. 2) The most notable deviation between EI and EI-C is the huge difference in the association constants. For instance, at 25 °C in the presence of Mg2+, the Ka values are 0.65 μm–1 and 170 μm–1 for EI and EI-C, respectively. This 262-fold increase is discussed below. 3) The Ka for EI-C was especially sensitive to high ionic strength. For example, as shown in Table 1, in the presence or absence of Mg2+, the Ka at 25 °C drops 70- to 90-fold when the KCl concentration is increased from 0.1 to 0.5 m. These results suggest that ionic interactions are of primary importance in the dimerization process.TABLE 1Effects of ligands and temperature on Ka, sedimentation coefficients, and frictional ratios (EI-C monomer and dimer)ConditionsKaMonomerbIf the shapes of the molecules are assumed to be prolate, the calculations give the following molecular diameters for the monomer: 117 Å when alone to 93 Å with both ligands. For oblate ellipsoids, the diameter changes from 78 Å without ligands to 69 Å with both ligands.DimercIf the shapes of the molecules are assumed to be prolate ellipsoids, the molecular diameters for the dimer changes from 151 Å in the absence of ligands to 130 Å in the presence of both ligands. For the oblate ellipsoid model, the diameter (2a) changes from 100 Å (no ligands) to 92 Å (with both ligands).0.1 m NaClaAssociation constant determined in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl, i.e. in buffer C, and 0.5 m NaCl, i.e. in buffer D.0.5 m NaClaAssociation constant determined in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl, i.e. in buffer C, and 0.5 m NaCl, i.e. in buffer D.5 °C25 °C5 °C25 °Cs20,w0f/f0s20,w0f/f0μm-1EI26.3940.211.262.82 ± 0.031.334.44 ± 0.031.35EI + MgCl2511700"
