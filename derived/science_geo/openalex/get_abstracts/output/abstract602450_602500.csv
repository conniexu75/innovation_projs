https://openalex.org/W2782189646,"In previous papers, we introduced a normative scheme for scene construction and epistemic (visual) searches based upon active inference. This scheme provides a principled account of how people decide where to look, when categorising a visual scene based on its contents. In this paper, we use active inference to explain the visual searches of normal human subjects; enabling us to answer some key questions about visual foraging and salience attribution. First, we asked whether there is any evidence for ‘epistemic foraging’; i.e. exploration that resolves uncertainty about a scene. In brief, we used Bayesian model comparison to compare Markov decision process (MDP) models of scan-paths that did–and did not–contain the epistemic, uncertainty-resolving imperatives for action selection. In the course of this model comparison, we discovered that it was necessary to include non-epistemic (heuristic) policies to explain observed behaviour (e.g., a reading-like strategy that involved scanning from left to right). Despite this use of heuristic policies, model comparison showed that there is substantial evidence for epistemic foraging in the visual exploration of even simple scenes. Second, we compared MDP models that did–and did not–allow for changes in prior expectations over successive blocks of the visual search paradigm. We found that implicit prior beliefs about the speed and accuracy of visual searches changed systematically with experience. Finally, we characterised intersubject variability in terms of subject-specific prior beliefs. Specifically, we used canonical correlation analysis to see if there were any mixtures of prior expectations that could predict between-subject differences in performance; thereby establishing a quantitative link between different behavioural phenotypes and Bayesian belief updating. We demonstrated that better scene categorisation performance is consistently associated with lower reliance on heuristics; i.e., a greater use of a generative model of the scene to direct its exploration."

Cryopreservation is currently the most common approach, but storage in liquid nitrogen is relatively costly and the requirement for low temperatures during shipping is inconvenient. Desiccation is an alternative strategy with the potential to enable viable cell preservation at more convenient storage temperatures without the need for liquid nitrogen. To achieve stability during storage in the dried state it is necessary to remove enough water that the remaining matrix forms a non-crystalline glassy solid. Thus, the glass transition temperature is a key parameter for design of cell desiccation procedures. In this study, we have investigated the effects of moisture content on the glass transition temperature (Tg) of mixtures of sugars (trehalose or raffinose), polymers (polyvinylpyrrolidone or Ficoll), penetrating cryoprotectants (ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or dimethyl sulfoxide), and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solutes. Aqueous solutions were dried to different moisture contents by equilibration with saturated salt solutions, or by baking at 95°C. The glass transition temperatures of the dehydrated samples were then measured by differential scanning calorimetry. As expected, Tg increased with decreasing moisture content. For example, in a desiccation medium containing 0.1 M trehalose in PBS, Tg ranged from about 360 K for a completely dry sample to about 220 K at a water mass fraction of 0.4. Addition of polymers to the solutions increased Tg, while addition of penetrating cryoprotectants decreased Tg. Our results provide insight into the relationship between relative humidity, moisture content and glass transition temperature for cell desiccation solutions containing sugars, polymers and penetrating cryoprotectants."
https://openalex.org/W2782505460,"Trace-element concentrations in acid mine drainage (AMD) are primarily controlled by the mineralogy at the sediment-water interface. Results are presented for a combined geochemical and mineralogical survey of Dabaoshan Mine, South China. Developed sequential extraction experiments with the analysis of the main mineralogical phases by semi-quantitative XRD, differential X-ray diffraction (DXRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were conducted to identify the quantitative relationship between iron minerals and heavy metals. Results showed that schwertmannite, jarosite, goethite and ferrihydrite were the dominant Fe-oxyhydroxide minerals which were detected alternately in the surface sediment with the increasing pH from 2.50 to 6.93 along the Hengshi River. Decreasing contents of schwertmannite ranging from 35 wt % to 6.5 wt % were detected along the Hengshi River, which was corresponding to the decreasing metal contents. The easily reducible fractions exert higher affinity of metals while compared with reducible and relatively stable minerals. A qualitative analysis of heavy metals extracted from the sediments indicated that the retention ability varied: Pb > Mn > Zn > As ≈ Cu > Cr > Cd ≈ Ni. Results in this study are avail for understanding the fate and transport of heavy metals associated with iron minerals and establishing the remediation strategies of AMD systems."
https://openalex.org/W2782157790,"Objective Dementia is a common neurological disease that substantially affects public health. A previous study revealed that dementia occurs when the body’s immune system attacks the cells of the brain, indicating that dementia may be similar to autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs). In the current retrospective cohort study, we focused on middle-aged ARD patients (45 years or older) to investigate the association between ARDs in middle-aged people and dementia by using a nationwide population-based database in Taiwan. Method Our study analyzed the medical data of the Taiwanese population from 2001 to 2012, with a follow-up period extending until the end of 2011. We identified middle-aged patients with ARDs by using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. We selected a comparison cohort from the general population that was randomly frequency-matched by age (in 5-year increments), sex, and index year and further analyzed the dementia risk by using a Cox regression model that considers sex, age, and comorbidities. Results The study enrolled 34,660 middle-aged ARD patients (77% female, mean age = 59.8 years) and 138,640 controls. The risk of developing dementia was 1.18 times higher for middle-aged patients with ARDs compared with patients without ARDs after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities. Among the patients with ARDs, the subgroups with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjögren syndrome (SS) were associated with a significantly higher dementia risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence index [CI] 1.06–1.32; adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86–1.34; adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.32–1.63, respectively). Furthermore, primary SS and secondary SS patients had the highest risks of dementia among all the ADR subgroups (adjusted HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.18–1.54; adjusted HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.43–1.95 respectively). Conclusion This nationwide retrospective cohort study demonstrated that dementia risk is significantly higher in middle-aged patients with ARDs compared with the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2782537207,"Background Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Treponema pallidum (TP), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) may lead to adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes. The role of combined maternal STIs in HIV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) was evaluated in mother-infant pairs from NICHD HPTN 040. Methodology Urine samples from HIV-infected pregnant women during labor were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CT, NG, and CMV. Infant HIV infection was determined by serial HIV DNA PCR testing. Maternal syphilis was tested by VDRL and confirmatory treponemal antibodies. Results A total of 899 mother-infant pairs were evaluated. Over 30% had at least one of the following infections (TP, CT, NG, and/or CMV) detected at the time of delivery. High rates of TP (8.7%), CT (17.8%), NG (4%), and CMV (6.3%) were observed. HIV MTCT was 9.1% (n = 82 infants). HIV MTCT was 12.5%, 10.3%, 11.1%, and 26.3% among infants born to women with CT, TP, NG or CMV respectively. Forty-two percent of HIV-infected infants were born to women with at least one of these 4 infections. Women with these infections were nearly twice as likely to have an HIV-infected infant (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.0), particularly those with 2 STIs (aOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5–7.7). Individually, maternal CMV (aOR 4.4 1.5–13.0) and infant congenital CMV (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.2–7.8) but not other STIs (TP, CT, or NG) were associated with an increased risk of HIV MTCT. Conclusion HIV-infected pregnant women identified during labor are at high risk for STIs. Co-infection with STIs including CMV nearly doubles HIV MTCT risk. CMV infection appears to confer the largest risk of HIV MTCT. Trial registration NCT00099359."
https://openalex.org/W2782158243,"Background Breathlessness is associated with major adverse health outcomes and is twice as common in women as men in the general population. We evaluated whether this is related to their lower absolute lung volumes. Methods Cross-sectional analysis of the population-based Swedish CardioPulmonarybioImage Study (SCAPIS) Pilot, including static spirometry and diffusing capacity (n = 1,013; 49% women). Breathlessness was measured using the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale and analyzed using ordinal logistic regression adjusting for age, pack-years of smoking, body mass index, chronic airway limitation, asthma, chronic bronchitis, depression and anxiety in all models. Results Breathlessness was twice as common in women as in men; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.20 (95% confidence interval, 1.32−3.66). Lower absolute lung volumes were associated with increased breathlessness prevalence in both men and women. The sex difference in breathlessness was unchanged when adjusting for lung function in %predicted, but disappeared when controlling for absolute values of total lung capacity (OR 1.12; 0.59−2.15), inspiratory capacity (OR 1.26; 0.68−2.35), forced vital capacity (OR 0.84; 0.42−1.66), forced expiratory volume in one second (OR 0.70; 0.36−1.35) or lung diffusing capacity (OR 1.07; 0.58−1.97). Conclusion In the general population, the markedly higher prevalence of breathlessness in women is related to their smaller absolute lung volumes."
https://openalex.org/W2591907991,"The multivariate nonlinear Granger causality developed by Bai et al. (2010) plays an important role in detecting the dynamic interrelationships between two groups of variables. Following the idea of Hiemstra-Jones (HJ) test proposed by Hiemstra and Jones (1994), they attempt to establish a central limit theorem (CLT) of their test statistic by applying the asymptotical property of multivariate $U$-statistic. However, Bai et al. (2016) revisit the HJ test and find that the test statistic given by HJ is NOT a function of $U$-statistics which implies that the CLT neither proposed by Hiemstra and Jones (1994) nor the one extended by Bai et al. (2010) is valid for statistical inference. In this paper, we re-estimate the probabilities and reestablish the CLT of the new test statistic. Numerical simulation shows that our new estimates are consistent and our new test performs decent size and power."
https://openalex.org/W2782398916,"Spinal fusion and bone defect after injuries, removal of bone tumors, and infections need to be repaired by implantation. In an aging society, recovery from these procedures is often difficult. In this study, we found that injection of SPG-178 leads to expression of several bone marker genes and mineralization in vitro, and revealed a significantly higher degree of newly formed bone matrix with use of SPG-178 in vivo. MC3T3-E1 cells were used to evaluate osteoblast differentiation promoted by SPG-178. To analyze gene expression, total RNA was isolated from MC3T3-E1 cells cultured for 7 and 14 days with control medium or SPG-178 medium. Among the several bone marker genes examined, SPG-178 significantly increased the mRNA levels for ALP, BMP-2 and Osteocalcin, OPN, BSP and for the Osterix. Ten-week-old female Wistar rats were used for all transplantation procedures. A PEEK cage was implanted into a bony defect (5 mm) within the left femoral mid-shaft, and stability was maintained by an external fixator. The PEEK cages were filled with either a SPG-178 hydrogel plus allogeneic bone chips (n = 4) or only allogeneic bone chips (n = 4). The rats were then kept for 56 days. Newly formed bone matrix was revealed inside the PEEK cage and there was an increased bone volume per total volume with the cage filled with SPG-178, compared to the control group. SPG-178 has potential in clinical applications because it has several benefits. These include its favorable bone conduction properties its ability to act as a support for various different cells and growth factors, its lack of infection risk compared with materials of animal origin such as ECM, and the ease with which it can be used to fill defects with complex shapes and combined with a wide range of other materials."
https://openalex.org/W2781524617,"Introduction Diabetes affects both the peripheral and central nervous systems. The aim of this study was to explore the changes in brain activity in response to thermal stimuli in diabetic patients with and without diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods A total of 36 right-handed volunteers were enrolled: eight patients with Type-2 diabetes mellitus and DPN, 13 patients with Type-2 diabetes mellitus lacking DPN (NDPN patients), and 15 healthy volunteers (HV). Blood oxygenation level-dependent baseline scans were performed, first without any stimuli, and then with four sessions of thermal stimuli (0, 10, 34, and 44°C, in a random order) applied to the lateral side of the right lower extremity. There was a 240-s rest interval between each thermal stimulation. Each stimulation session consisted of three cycles of 30 s of stimulation followed by 30 s of rest. After each stimuli session, the participant rated pain and itch perception on a visual analog scale. The fMRI data series were analyzed by using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 and Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI. Results In response to temperature stimuli, DPN patients showed stronger activation than HV and NDPN patients, not only in brain areas that participate in somatosensory pathways (right insula, left caudate nucleus, frontal gyrus, and cingulate cortex), but also in the cognition-related cerebral areas (right temporal lobe, left hippocampus, and left fusiform gyrus). Activation of vermis 1–3 was greater in NDPN patients than in HV in response to 0°C stimulation. Conclusions fMRI may be useful for the early detection of central nervous system impairment caused by DPN. Our results indicate that central nervous system impairment related to diabetic neuropathy may not be limited to motion- and sensation-related cortical regions. Cognition-associated cerebral regions such as the hippocampus and fusiform gyrus are also affected by functional changes caused by DPN. This suggests that fMRI can detect the early stages of cognitive impairment in DPN patients before the symptoms become clinically significant."
https://openalex.org/W2782100502,"Research on brain disorders with a strong genetic component and complex heritability, such as schizophrenia, has led to the development of brain transcriptomics. This field seeks to gain a deeper understanding of gene expression, a key factor in exploring further research issues. Our study focused on how genes are associated amongst each other. In this perspective, we have developed a novel data-driven strategy for characterizing genetic modules, i.e., clusters of strongly interacting genes. The aim was to uncover a pivotal community of genes linked to a target gene for schizophrenia. Our approach combined network topological properties with information theory to highlight the presence of a pivotal community, for a specific gene, and to simultaneously assess the information content of partitions with the Shannon’s entropy based on betweenness. We analyzed the publicly available BrainCloud dataset containing post-mortem gene expression data and focused on the Dopamine D2 receptor, encoded by the DRD2 gene. We used four different community detection algorithms to evaluate the consistence of our approach. A pivotal DRD2 community emerged for all the procedures applied, with a considerable reduction in size, compared to the initial network. The stability of the results was confirmed by a Dice index ≥80% within a range of tested parameters. The detected community was also the most informative, as it represented an optimization of the Shannon entropy. Lastly, we verified the strength of connection of the DRD2 community, which was stronger than any other randomly selected community and even more so than the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis module, commonly considered the standard approach for such studies. This finding substantiates the conclusion that the detected community represents a more connected and informative cluster of genes for the DRD2 community, and therefore better elucidates the behavior of this module of strongly related DRD2 genes. Because this gene plays a relevant role in Schizophrenia, this finding of a more specific DRD2 community will improve the understanding of the genetic factors related with this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2782279313,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the human brain, leading to depletion of dopamine production. Dopamine replacement therapy remains the mainstay for attenuation of PD symptoms. Nonetheless, the potential benefit of current pharmacotherapies is mostly limited by adverse side effects, such as drug-induced dyskinesia, motor fluctuations and psychosis. Non-dopaminergic receptors, such as human A2A adenosine receptors, have emerged as important therapeutic targets in potentiating therapeutic effects and reducing the unwanted side effects. In this study, new chemical entities targeting both human A2A adenosine receptor and dopamine D2 receptor were designed and evaluated. Two computational methods, namely support vector machine (SVM) models and Tanimoto similarity-based clustering analysis, were integrated for the identification of compounds containing indole-piperazine-pyrimidine (IPP) scaffold. Subsequent synthesis and testing resulted in compounds 5 and 6, which acted as human A2A adenosine receptor binders in the radioligand competition assay (Ki = 8.7–11.2 μM) as well as human dopamine D2 receptor binders in the artificial cell membrane assay (EC50 = 22.5–40.2 μM). Moreover, compound 5 showed improvement in movement and mitigation of the loss of dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila models of PD. Furthermore, in vitro toxicity studies on compounds 5 and 6 did not reveal any mutagenicity (up to 100 μM), hepatotoxicity (up to 30 μM) or cardiotoxicity (up to 30 μM)."
https://openalex.org/W2781931286,"Trypanosomatids (Trypanosomatidae, Kinetoplastida) are flagellated protozoa containing many parasites of medical or agricultural importance. Among those, Crithidia bombi and C. expoeki, are common parasites in bumble bees around the world, and phylogenetically close to Leishmania and Leptomonas. They have a simple and direct life cycle with one host, and partially castrate the founding queens greatly reducing their fitness. Here, we report the nuclear genome sequences of one clone of each species, extracted from a field-collected infection. Using a combination of Roche 454 FLX Titanium, Pacific Biosciences PacBio RS, and Illumina GA2 instruments for C. bombi, and PacBio for C. expoeki, we could produce high-quality and well resolved sequences. We find that these genomes are around 32 and 34 MB, with 7,808 and 7,851 annotated genes for C. bombi and C. expoeki, respectively—which is somewhat less than reported from other trypanosomatids, with few introns, and organized in polycistronic units. A large fraction of genes received plausible functional support in comparison primarily with Leishmania and Trypanosoma. Comparing the annotated genes of the two species with those of six other trypanosomatids (C. fasciculata, L. pyrrhocoris, L. seymouri, B. ayalai, L. major, and T. brucei) shows similar gene repertoires and many orthologs. Similar to other trypanosomatids, we also find signs of concerted evolution in genes putatively involved in the interaction with the host, a high degree of synteny between C. bombi and C. expoeki, and considerable overlap with several other species in the set. A total of 86 orthologous gene groups show signatures of positive selection in the branch leading to the two Crithidia under study, mostly of unknown function. As an example, we examined the initiating glycosylation pathway of surface components in C. bombi, finding it deviates from most other eukaryotes and also from other kinetoplastids, which may indicate rapid evolution in the extracellular matrix that is involved in interactions with the host. Bumble bees are important pollinators and Crithidia-infections are suspected to cause substantial selection pressure on their host populations. These newly sequenced genomes provide tools that should help better understand host-parasite interactions in these pollinator pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2781942924,"Objectives Lymphedema is sometimes accompanied by high degrees of anxiety and depression. This study aimed to assess the effects of relaxation techniques on the level of edema, anxiety and depression in women undergoing Comprehensive Decongestive Therapy (CDT). Design This clinical trial compared two treatment methods in 31 women with post-mastectomy lymphedema, including 15 cases who received CDT and 16 who received RCDT (Relaxation plus CDT). The edema volume, anxiety and depression scores were compared at the first and last sessions of the first phase of the treatment and six weeks afterwards. Results The edema, anxiety and depression scores were 63.6%, 54.1% and 65.5% in the RCDT group and 60.7%, 31.4% and 35.2% in the CDT group. There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of the reduction in depression (p = 0.024) and anxiety (p = 0.011) scores throughout the study. This significant relationship was due to the differences in the depression score in the 3rd and 9th weeks of the study between the two groups. Similarly, anxiety levels differed significantly between the two groups at the 9th week of the study (P = 0.013). Conclusion Relaxation techniques reduced the anxiety and depression scores and the volume of edema in the patients with lymphedema. The addition of this intervention to the therapeutic package for lymphedema patients requires further studies in terms of cost-effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2781684517,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the dosimetric equivalence of magnetic resonance (MR)-generated synthetic CT (synCT) and simulation CT for treatment planning in radiotherapy of rectal cancer. Methods This study was conducted on eleven patients who underwent whole-body PET/MR and PET/CT examination in a prospective IRB-approved study. For each patient synCT was generated from Dixon MR using a model-based method. Standard treatment planning directives were used to create a four-field box (4F), an oblique four-field (O4F) and a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan on synCT for treatment of rectal cancer. The plans were recalculated on CT with the same monitor units (MUs) as that of synCT. Dose-volume metrics of planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs) as well as gamma analysis of dose distributions were evaluated to quantify the difference between synCT and CT plans. All plans were calculated using the analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA). The VMAT plans on synCT and CT were also calculated using the Acuros XB algorithm for comparison with the AAA calculation. Results Medians of absolute differences in PTV metrics between synCT and CT plans were 0.2%, 0.2% and 0.3% for 4F, O4F and VMAT respectively. No significant differences were observed in OAR dose metrics including bladder V40Gy, mean dose in bladder, bowel V45Gy and femoral head V30Gy in any techniques. Gamma analysis with 2%/2mm dose difference/distance to agreement criteria showed median passing rates of 99.8% (range: 98.5 to 100%), 99.9% (97.2 to 100%), and 99.9% (99.4 to 100%) for 4F, O4F and VMAT, respectively. Using Acuros XB dose calculation, 2%/2mm gamma analysis generated a passing rate of 99.2% (97.7 to 99.9%) for VMAT plans. Conclusion SynCT enabled dose calculation equivalent to conventional CT for treatment planning of 3D conformal treatment as well as VMAT of rectal cancer. The dosimetric agreement between synCT and CT calculated doses demonstrated the potential of MR-only treatment planning for rectal cancer using MR generated synCT."
https://openalex.org/W2782080322,"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) provides resistance to tibial internal rotation torque and anterior shear at the knee. ACL deficiency results in knee instability. Optimisation of muscle contraction through functional electrical stimulation (FES) offers the prospect of mitigating the destabilising effects of ACL deficiency. The hypothesis of this study is that activation of the biceps femoris long head (BFLH) reduces the tibial internal rotation torque and the anterior shear force at the knee. Gait data of twelve healthy subjects were measured with and without the application of FES and taken as inputs to a computational musculoskeletal model. The model was used to investigate the optimum levels of BFLH activation during FES gait in reducing the anterior shear force to zero. This study found that FES significantly reduced the tibial internal rotation torque at the knee during the stance phase of gait (p = 0.0322) and the computational musculoskeletal modelling revealed that a mean BFLH activation of 20.8% (±8.4%) could reduce the anterior shear force to zero. At the time frame when the anterior shear force was zero, the internal rotation torque was reduced by 0.023 ± 0.0167 Nm/BW, with a mean 188% reduction across subjects (p = 0.0002). In conclusion, activation of the BFLH is able to reduce the tibial internal rotation torque and the anterior shear force at the knee in healthy control subjects. This should be tested on ACL deficient subject to consider its effect in mitigating instability due to ligament deficiency. In future clinical practice, activating the BFLH may be used to protect ACL reconstructions during post-operative rehabilitation, assist with residual instabilities post reconstruction, and reduce the need for ACL reconstruction surgery in some cases."
https://openalex.org/W2781992293,"Behavioral states alternate between wakefulness (wk), rapid eye movement (rem) and non-rem (nrem) sleep at time scale of hours i.e., light and dark cycle rhythms and from several tens of minutes to seconds (i.e., brief awakenings during sleep). Using statistical analysis of bout duration, Markov chains of sleep-wk dynamics and quantitative EEG analysis, we evaluated the influence of light/dark (ld) changes on brain function along the sleep-wk cycle. Bout duration (bd) histograms and Kaplan-Meier (km) survival curves of wk showed a bimodal statistical distribution, suggesting that two types of wk do exist: brief-wk (wkb) and long-wk (wkl). Light changes modulated specifically wkl bouts, increasing its duration during active/dark period. In contrast, wkb, nrem and rem bd histograms and km curves did not change significantly along ld cycle. Hippocampal eeg of both types of wk were different: in comparison wkb showed a lower spectral power in fast gamma and fast theta bands and less emg tone. After fitting a four-states Markov chain to mice hypnograms, moreover in states transition probabilities matrix was found that: in dark/active period, state-maintenance probability of wkl increased, and probability of wkl to nrem transition decreased; the opposite was found in light period, favoring the hypothesis of the participation of brief wk into nrem-rem intrinsic sleep cycle, and the role of wkl in SWS homeostasis. In conclusion, we propose an extended Markov model of sleep using four stages (wkl, nrem, rem, wkb) as a fully adequate model accounting for both modulation of sleep-wake dynamics based on the differential regulation of long-wk (high gamma/theta) epochs during dark and light phases."
https://openalex.org/W2781567506,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness. DR is recognized as a microvascular disease and inner retinal neurodegeneration. In the course of retinal neurodegeneration, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitotoxicity is involved. Full activation of NMDAR requires binding of agonist glutamate and coagonist glycine or D-serine. D-Serine is produced from L-serine by serine racemase (SRR) and contributes to retinal neurodegeneration in rodent models of DR. However, the involvement of SRR in both neurodegeneration and microvascular damage in DR remains unclear. Here, we established diabetic model of SRR knockout (SRR-KO) and control wild-type (WT) mice by streptozotocin injection. Six months after the onset of diabetes, the number of survived retinal ganglion cells was higher in SRR-KO mice than that of WT mice. The reduction of thickness of inner retinal layer (IRL) was attenuated in SRR-KO mice than that of WT mice. Moreover, the number of damaged acellular capillaries was lower in SRR-KO mice than that of WT mice. Our results suggest the suppression of SRR activity may have protective effects in DR."
https://openalex.org/W2782083631,"Hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification are frequent complications of chronic renal failure and bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) has been shown to protect against development of vascular calcification in uremia. The present investigation examined the potential reversibility of established uremic vascular calcification by treatment of uremic rats with BMP7. A control model of isogenic transplantation of a calcified aorta from uremic rats into healthy littermates examined whether normalization of the uremic environment reversed vascular calcification. Uremia and vascular calcification were induced in rats by 5/6 nephrectomy, high phosphate diet and alfacalcidol treatment. After 14 weeks severe vascular calcification was present and rats were allocated to BMP7, vehicle or aorta transplantation. BMP7 treatment caused a significant decrease of plasma phosphate to 1.56 ± 0.17 mmol/L vs 2.06 ± 0.34 mmol/L in the vehicle group even in the setting of uremia and high phosphate diet. Uremia and alfacalcidol resulted in an increase in aortic expression of genes related to fibrosis, osteogenic transformation and extracellular matrix calcification, and the BMP7 treatment resulted in a decrease in the expression of profibrotic genes. The total Ca-content of the aorta was however unchanged both in the abdominal aorta: 1.9 ± 0.6 μg/mg tissue in the vehicle group vs 2.2 ± 0.6 μg/mg tissue in the BMP7 group and in the thoracic aorta: 71 ± 27 μg/mg tissue in the vehicle group vs 54 ± 18 μg/mg tissue in the BMP7 group. Likewise, normalization of the uremic environment by aorta transplantation had no effect on the Ca-content of the calcified aorta: 16.3 ± 0.6 μg/mg tissue pre-transplantation vs 15.9 ± 2.3 μg/mg tissue post-transplantation. Aortic expression of genes directly linked to extracellular matrix calcification was not affected by BMP7 treatment, which hypothetically might explain persistent high Ca-content in established vascular calcification. The present results highlight the importance of preventing the development of vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. Once established, vascular calcification persists even in the setting when hyperphosphatemia or the uremic milieu is abolished."

https://openalex.org/W2782347647,"The ability to orchestrate appropriate physiological and behavioral responses to stress is important for survival, and is often dysfunctional in neuropsychiatric disorders that account for leading causes of global disability burden. Numerous studies have shown that the endocannabinoid neurotransmitter system is able to regulate stress responses and could serve as a therapeutic target for the management of these disorders. We used quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions to show that genes encoding enzymes that synthesize (abhd4, gde1, napepld), enzymes that degrade (faah, faah2a, faah2b), and receptors that bind (cnr1, cnr2, gpr55-like) endocannabinoids are expressed in zebrafish (Danio rerio). These genes are conserved in many other vertebrates, including humans, but fatty acid amide hydrolase 2 has been lost in mice and rats. We engineered transcription activator-like effector nucleases to create zebrafish with mutations in cnr1 and faah2a to test the role of these genes in modulating stress-associated behavior. We showed that disruption of cnr1 potentiated locomotor responses to hyperosmotic stress. The increased response to stress was consistent with rodent literature and served to validate the use of zebrafish in this field. Moreover, we showed for the first time that disruption of faah2a attenuated the locomotor responses to hyperosmotic stress. This later finding suggests that FAAH2 may be an important mediator of stress responses in non-rodent vertebrates. Accordingly, FAAH and FAAH2 modulators could provide distinct therapeutic options for stress-aggravated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2782478183,"The goal of this study was to assess the goodness-of-fit of theoretical models of population dynamics of Aedes aegypti to trap data collected by a long term entomological surveillance program. The carrying capacity K of this vector was estimated at city and neighborhood level. Adult mosquito abundance was measured via adults collected weekly by a network of sticky traps (Mosquitraps) from January 2008 to December 2011 in Vitória, Espírito Santo, Brazil. K was the only free parameter estimated by the model. At the city level, the model with temperature as a driver captured the seasonal pattern of mosquito abundance. At the local level, we observed a spatial heterogeneity in the estimated carrying capacity between neighborhoods, weakly associated with environmental variables related to poor infrastructure. Model goodness-of-fit was influenced by the number of sticky traps, and suggests a minimum of 16 traps at the neighborhood level for surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2781509724,"Success in tuberculosis control depends on the implementation of steps that reduce social inequities, allowing the diagnosis and effective treatment of the disease. Little is known about the conditions affecting antituberculosis treatment non-adherence in areas of great social and economic heterogeneity, such as the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. This study aimed to describe and identify the social determinants of antituberculosis treatment non-adherence in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro between 2008 and 2012. An ecological study was conducted with the districts of Rio de Janeiro as the units of analysis. Analyzes using Poisson regression models allowed us to identify the association between dropout from antituberculosis treatment and the human development index and social development index. The final model showed that economic conditions, infrastructure, and the tuberculosis control quality of surveillance were associated with treatment non-adherence. This study demonstrated that the scenarios of socio-environmental precariousness found in the districts of Rio de Janeiro were able to identify populations with an increased risk of default treatment from antituberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2781835323,"When the Zika virus outbreak became a global health emergency in early 2016, the scientific community responded with an increased output of Zika-related research. This upsurge in research naturally made its way into academic journals along with editorials, news, and reports. However, it is not yet known how or whether these scholarly communications were distributed to the populations most affected by Zika.To understand how scientific outputs about Zika reached global and local audiences, we collected Tweets and Facebook posts that linked to Zika-related research in the first six months of 2016. Using a language detection algorithm, we found that up to 90% of Twitter and 76% of Facebook posts are in English. However, when none of the authors of the scholarly article are from English-speaking countries, posts on both social media are less likely to be in English. The effect is most pronounced on Facebook, where the likelihood of posting in English is between 11 and 16% lower when none of the authors are from English-speaking countries, as compared to when some or all are. Similarly, posts about papers written with a Brazilian author are 13% more likely to be in Portuguese on Facebook than when made on Twitter.Our main conclusion is that scholarly communication on Twitter and Facebook of Zika-related research is dominated by English, despite Brazil being the epicenter of the Zika epidemic. This result suggests that scholarly findings about the Zika virus are unlikely to be distributed directly to relevant populations through these popular online mediums. Nevertheless, there are differences between platforms. Compared to Twitter, scholarly communication on Facebook is more likely to be in the language of an author's country. The Zika outbreak provides a useful case-study for understanding how scientific outputs are communicated to relevant populations. Our results suggest that Facebook is a more effective channel than Twitter, if communication is desired to be in the native language of the affected country. Further research should explore how local media-such as governmental websites, newspapers and magazines, as well as television and radio-disseminate scholarly publication."
https://openalex.org/W2782128555,"The prevalence of childhood overweight is a major social and public health issue, and primary assessment should focus on early and middle childhood, because weight gain in these phases constitutes a strong predictor of subsequent negative outcomes. Studies on community samples have shown that growth curves may follow linear or non-linear trajectories from early to middle childhood, and can differ based on sex. Overweight children may exhibit a combination of physiological and psychosocial issues, and several studies have demonstrated an association between overweight and internalizing/externalizing behavior. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of longitudinal studies on depressive and aggressive symptoms in children with high BMI. This study adopted a growth curve modeling over three phases to: (1) describe BMI trajectories in two groups of children aged 2–8 (overweight and normal weight) from a community sample; (2) describe the developmental trajectories of children’s aggressive and depressive symptoms from 2 to 8 years of age. Results indicate higher BMI in 2-year-old girls, with males catching up with them by age 8. While overweight females’ BMIs were consistently high, males’ increased at 5 and 8 years. The mean scores for aggressive symptoms at T1 (2 years of age) were the same in all subjects, but a significant deviation occurred from T1 to T2 in both samples, in divergent directions. With regards to children’s depressive symptoms, the two groups had different starting points, with normal weight children scoring lower than overweight youths. Overweight females showed lower depressive scores than overweight males at T1, but they surpassed boys before T2, and showed more maladaptive symptoms at T3. This study solicits professionals working in pediatric settings to consider overweight children’s psychopathological risk, and to be aware that even when children’s BMI does not increase from 2 to 8 years, their psychopathological symptoms may grow in intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2782299394,"Appropriate intestinal barrier maturation is essential for absorbing nutrients and preventing pathogens and toxins from entering the body. Compared to breast-fed infants, formula-fed infants are more susceptible to barrier dysfunction-associated illnesses. In infant formula dairy lipids are usually replaced with plant lipids. We hypothesised that dairy complex lipids improve in vitro intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. We tested milkfat high in conjugated linoleic acid, beta serum (SureStart™Lipid100), beta serum concentrate (BSC) and a ganglioside-rich fraction (G600). Using Caco-2 cells as a model of the human small intestinal epithelium, we analysed the effects of the ingredients on trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), mannitol flux, and tight junction protein co-localisation. BSC induced a dose-dependent improvement in TEER across unchallenged cell layers, maintained the co-localisation of tight junction proteins in TNFα-challenged cells with increased permeability, and mitigated the TEER-reducing effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). G600 also increased TEER across healthy and LPS-challenged cells, but it did not alter the co-location of tight junction proteins in TNFα-challenged cells. SureStart™Lipid100 had similar TEER-increasing effects to BSC when added at twice the concentration (similar lipid concentration). Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the development of infant formulas supplemented with dairy complex lipids that support infant intestinal barrier maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2782493683,"Host plant phenology (as influenced by seasonality) and light-mediated changes in the phenotypic and phytochemical properties of leaves have been hypothesised to equivocally influence insect herbivore performance. Here, we examined the effects of seasonality, through host plant phenology (late growth-season = autumn vs flowering-season = winter) and light environment (shade vs full-sun habitat) on the leaf characteristics of the invasive alien plant, Chromolaena odorata. In addition, the performance of a specialist folivore, Pareuchaetes insulata, feeding on leaves obtained from both shaded and full-sun habitats during autumn and winter, was evaluated over two generations. Foliar nitrogen and magnesium contents were generally higher in shaded plants with much higher levels during winter. Leaf water content was higher in shaded and in autumn plants. Total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) and phosphorus contents did not differ as a function of season, but were higher in shaded foliage compared to full-sun leaves. Leaf toughness was noticeably higher on plants growing in full-sun during winter. With the exception of shaded leaves in autumn that supported the best performance [fastest development, heaviest pupal mass, and highest growth rate and Host Suitability Index (HSI) score], full-sun foliage in autumn surprisingly also supported an improved performance of the moth compared to shaded or full-sun leaves in winter. Our findings suggest that shaded and autumn foliage are nutritionally more suitable for the growth and reproduction of P. insulata. However, the heavier pupal mass, increased number of eggs and higher HSI score in individuals that fed on full-sun foliage in autumn compared to their counterparts that fed on shaded or full-sun foliage in winter suggest that full-sun foliage during autumn is also a suitable food source for larvae of the moth. In sum, our study demonstrates that seasonal and light-modulated changes in leaf characteristics can affect insect folivore performance in ways that are not linear."
https://openalex.org/W2781567866,"Aims The ductus arteriosus (DA) closes after birth to adapt to the robust changes in hemodynamics, which require intimal thickening (IT) to occur. The smooth muscle cells of the DA have been reported to play important roles in IT formation. However, the roles of the endothelial cells (ECs) have not been fully investigated. We herein focused on tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), which is a DA EC dominant gene, and investigated its contribution to IT formation in the DA. Methods and results ECs from the DA and aorta were isolated from fetal rats using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. RT-PCR showed that the t-PA mRNA expression level was 2.7-fold higher in DA ECs than in aortic ECs from full-term rat fetuses (gestational day 21). A strong immunoreaction for t-PA was detected in pre-term and full-term rat DA ECs. t-PA-mediated plasminogen-plasmin conversion activates gelatinase matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Gelatin zymography revealed that plasminogen supplementation significantly promoted activation of the elastolytic enzyme MMP-2 in rat DA ECs. In situ zymography demonstrated that marked gelatinase activity was observed at the site of disruption in the internal elastic laminae (IEL) in full-term rat DA. In a three-dimensional vascular model, EC-mediated plasminogen-plasmin conversion augmented the IEL disruption. In vivo administration of plasminogen to pre-term rat fetuses (gestational day 19), in which IT is poorly formed, promoted IEL disruption accompanied by gelatinase activation and enhanced IT formation in the DA. Additionally, experiments using five human DA tissues demonstrated that the t-PA expression level was 3.7-fold higher in the IT area than in the tunica media. t-PA protein expression and gelatinase activity were also detected in the IT area of the human DAs. Conclusion t-PA expressed in ECs may help to form IT of the DA via activation of MMP-2 and disruption of IEL."
https://openalex.org/W2781744323,"Objective This study describes the association between history of lifetime traumatic brain injury (TBI) and current disabling functional restrictions among Ontario adults. Setting and design A two-stage rolling cross-sectional sample of 6,048 adults aged 18 to 93 were interviewed by computer assisted telephone interviewing between 2011–2013 regarding their mental health and substance use in Ontario, Canada. TBI criteria were defined by loss of consciousness for minimum five minutes or at least one overnight hospitalization. Dimensions of functionality restrictions in the last 30 days were measured with the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS). Results The estimated mean for global disability in this sample of Ontario adults was 2.75 (SD = 5.4, range 0–40). The estimated means of global disability for individuals who reported a history of lifetime TBI was 4.16 (SD = 7.12) and compared with 2.46 (SD = 4.98) for individuals who never had a TBI (p < 0.001). Adults with a history of lifetime TBI had greater odds of global and item disability including restricted cognition, decreased self-care, difficulties with social relationships, fewer life activities and reduced participation in society compared to adults without a history of TBI (p < 0.001), even after adjusting for values of age, sex, marital status, household income and education. Conclusion The co-occurrence of history of lifetime TBI with self-reported disability within the past 30 days provide evidence that careful consideration, planning and understanding of short and long term health needs of TBI survivors are critical."
https://openalex.org/W2782270869,"Objective We previously reported that patients with cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency (CETP-D) have a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, in spite of increased HDL-C levels. However, characterization of HDL in CETP-D has not been well described. Therefore, we examined HDL particle number (PN) rather than HDL-C level. Approach and results Nine patients with CETP-D and 9 normolipidemic subjects were enrolled. We performed gel permeation high-performance liquid chromatography (GP-HPLC) analysis, determined the cholesterol and triglyceride composition of all lipoprotein subclasses, and calculated the PN of each subclass, which consisted of 3 VLDL (large, medium, and small), 4 LDL (large, medium, small, and very small), and 5 HDL (very large, large, medium, small, and very small) subclasses. The PNs of large and medium LDL were significantly lower in CETP-D than that in healthy subjects (0.66- and 0.63-fold decrease, respectively; p<0.001), whereas the PN of very small LDL, which is known to be atherogenic, was significantly higher (1.36-fold increase, p = 0.016). The PNs of very large and large HDL in CETP-D were markedly higher than that in healthy subjects (19.9- and 4.5-fold increase, respectively; p<0.001), whereas the PNs of small and very small HDL, which have more potent anti-atherogenic functions, were significantly lower (0.76- and 0.61-fold decrease, respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion We have assessed the PNs of detailed subclasses of patients with CETP-D for the first time. The PN of larger HDL was markedly increased, that of smaller HDL was decreased, and that of very small LDL was increased, suggesting that CETP-D has pro-atherogenic lipoprotein properties."
https://openalex.org/W2782413595,"Objective From April 2013 to February 2014 we performed a multicentre prospective cross-sectional study in 541 German nursing home residents. We determined pharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (primary objective) and other bacteria (secondary objective) in naso- and oropharyngeal swabs by culture-based standard procedures and explored the influence of multimorbidity and functional status on bacterial carriage. Methods Socio-demographic data, vaccination status, multimorbidity, nutrition and functional status defined by Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment were evaluated. We estimated carriage rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and explored potential risk factors by logistic regression analysis. Results Pneumococcal post-serotyping carriage rate was 0.8% (95%CI 0.2–1.9%; 4/526). Serotyping revealed serotypes 4, 7F, 23B and 23F and S. pseudopneumoniae in two other cases. Odds of carriage were higher in men (Odds ratio OR 5.3 (95%CI 0.9–29.4)), in malnourished residents (OR 4.6 (0.8–25.7)), residents living in shared rooms (OR 3.0 (0.5–16.5)) or having contact with schoolchildren (OR 2.0 (0.2–17.6)). The most frequent pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (prevalence 29.5% (25.6–33.6%)) with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus prevalence of 1.1%. Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were found in 22.5% (19.0–26.3%) with a prevalence of extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria of 0.8%. Odds of S. aureus carriage were higher for immobility (OR 1.84 (1.15–2.93)) and cognitive impairment (OR 1.54 (0.98–2.40)). Odds of GNB carriage were higher in residents with more severe comorbidity (OR 1.13 (1.00–1.28)) and malnutrition (OR 1.54 (0.81–2.91)). Conclusions Given the observed data, at least long-term carriage of S. pneumoniae in nursing home residents seems to be rare and rather unlikely to cause nursing home acquired pneumonia. The low rate of colonization with multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria confirms that nursing home residency is not a risk factor for MDR pneumonia in Germany. For individual risk assessment in this susceptible population, immobility and malnutrition should be considered as signs of functional impairment as well as comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2782428241,"Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is a major cause of illness and death among children worldwide. 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was introduced as part of the Mozambican routine immunization program in April 2013. We characterized the IPD burden in a rural area of Mozambique before PCV introduction and estimated the potential impact of this intervention.We conducted population-based surveillance for IPD, defined as S. pneumoniae isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid, among children <5 years old admitted to Manhiça District Hospital, a referral hospital in a rural area with high prevalence of human immunodiciency virus infection. S. pneumoniae was identified using standard microbiologic methods and serotyped using sequential multiplex PCR or Quellung. IPD incidence was calculated among cases from a defined catchment area.From January 2001 through December 2012, we isolated 768 cases of IPD, 498 (65%) of which were bacteraemic pneumonia episodes. A total of 391 (51%) were from the catchment area, yielding IPD incidence rates of 479, 390 and 107 episodes per 100,000 children-years at risk among children <12, 12-23 and 24-<60 months old, respectively. The overall IPD incidence fluctuated and showed a downward trend over time. In these same age groups, in-hospital death occurred in 48 (17%), 26 (12%), and 21 (13%) of all IPD cases, respectively. Overall 90% (543/603) of IPD isolates were available for serotyping; of those, 65% were covered by PCV10 and 83% by PCV13. Among 77 hospital deaths associated with serotyped IPD, 49% and 69% were caused by isolates included in the PCV10 and PCV13, respectively.We describe very high rates of IPD among children in rural Mozambique that were declining before PCV introduction. Children <1 year old have the greatest incidence and case fatality; although the rates remain high among older groups as well. Most IPD episodes and many deaths among children <5 years old will likely be prevented through PCV10 introduction in Mozambique."
https://openalex.org/W2781541623,"Leptin plays a role in stimulating vascular inflammation, vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy, and augmenting blood pressure, which contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and leads to arterial stiffness. This vascular damage, measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), is recognized as an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between serum leptin and arterial stiffness in HD patients.In 112 of the 126 HD patients were eligible and their biochemical data were collected for analysis. Serum leptin level was measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was measured by a validated tonometry system (SphygmoCor). Those have cfPWV values above 10 m/s are defined as the high arterial stiffness group.Among the participants, thirty-eight of them who were in the high arterial stiffness group, had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.002), age (p = 0.029), body mass index (BMI, p = 0.018), body fat mass (p = 0.001), hemoglobin (p = 0.040), and serum leptin levels (P<0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that leptin (odds ratio [OR] 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.14; p <0.001), diabetes (OR 7.17; CI 1.39-37.00; p = 0.019), body fat mass (OR 1.16; CI 1.02-1.33; p = 0.027); and hemoglobin (OR 2.11; CI 1.15-3.87; p = 0.015) were independently associated with arterial stiffness in HD patients.In our study, hyperleptinemia was positively correlated to the high cfPWV and thus was related to high arterial stiffness in HD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2781603382,"Stress-induced phosphoprotein-1 (STIP1), an adaptor protein that coordinates the functions of HSP70 and HSP90 in protein folding, has been implicated in the development of human gynecologic malignancies. This case-control study investigates STIP1 serum levels and tissue expression in relation to endometriosis/adenomyosis in Taiwanese population. Female patients with surgically confirmed endometriosis/adenomyosis were compared with women free of endometriosis/adenomyosis. Serum STIP1 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surgical tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Both epithelial and stromal cells in surgical tissues of endometriosis and adenomyosis expressed STIP1 and MMP-9. Notably, MMP-9 expression was significantly decreased when STIP1 expression was knocked-down. In vitro experiments revealed that STIP1 was capable of binding to the MMP-9 promoter and enhanced its transcriptional expression. The preoperative serum STIP1 levels of patients with endometriosis/adenomyosis were significantly higher than those of the controls. In brief, our data suggest an association between STIP1 levels and endometriosis/adenomyosis."
https://openalex.org/W2782244552,"Background Regorafenib has been demonstrated as effective in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Combination use with chemotherapy has not been reported. We examined the efficacy and safety of adding chemotherapy to Regorafenib for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC) patients. Methods We recruited mCRC patients at our institute who received either regorafenib monotherapy or regorafenib in combination with other chemotherapies. All patients had received chemo and target therapies and presented with disease progression before regorafenib treatment. The primary end point was overall survival. Findings Between September1, 2015 and May 31, 2017, 100 mCRC patients at our institute received regorafenib treatment. 39 patients were excluded due to poor performance, lack of timely treatment, or inadequate clinical data. A total of 34 patients received regorafenib combined with other chemotherapies, and 27 patients received regorafenib alone. Median follow up time was 10.4 and 6.1 months, respectively. The primary end point of median OS was higher in the combination group than in the single use group (20.9m vs 10.3m, p = 0.015). The most frequent adverse events were hand-foot skin reactions(16[47.1%]vs 12[44.4%]), fatigue(6[17.6%] vs 7[25.9%]), gastrointestinal discomfort (7[20.6%] vs 6[22.2%]), neutropenia (4[11.8%] vs 1[3.7%]), diarrhea(4[11.8%] vs 1[3.7%]), and mucositis(5[14.7%] vs 1[3.7%]). Conclusion The present study showed the efficacy and side effects of regorafenib combination treatment. Superiority in median OS and median PFS was noted in the combination group. The sampling difference between the study and observation groups effects justifies the comparison. Further clinical evidence of combination therapy efficacy is pending future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2781559564,"Adiponectin, a metabolically-active cytokine secreted from adipose tissue, is reported to have anti-apoptotic effects on β-cells as well as anti-hyperglycemic effects through adiponectin receptor signaling. However, the anti-apoptotic effects of adiponectin on β-cells have not been confirmed in established diabetic models, and the anti-hyperglycemic effects and their associated signal cascades remain controversial. To investigate the effects of adiponectin on β-cell protection and its down-stream signaling events, we have generated β-cell-specific rat insulin promoter (RIP)-AdipoR1 transgenic mice (AdipoR1 mice), in which the adiponectin receptor, AdipoR1, is overexpressed in β-cells in a manner synchronous with insulin demand. AdipoR1 mice were then mated with Akita mice, a diabetes model in which β-cell apoptosis results from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. AdipoR1 protein expression and localization in islets from AdipoR1 mice as well as in an AdipoR1-transfected mouse insulinoma cell line were confirmed, as was the activation of both AMPK and Akt in AdipoR1 mice by adiponectin. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in Ad lib feed and fasting blood glucose levels, or in glucose tolerance tests, between Akita mice [Ins2Akita (C96Y) +/- mouse model] and AdipoR1/Akita and from 4 weeks to 10 weeks of age. Similarly, pancreatic insulin contents of AdipoR1/Akita mice were not significantly different from those in Akita mice from 15 to 20 weeks of age, but they were significantly lower than in wild-type mice. Immunostaining for insulin and subsequent electron microscopy showed that β-cell destruction in AdipoR1/Akita mice was not markedly improved in comparison with that in Akita mice. Serum adiponectin concentrations were confirmed to be extremely high (> 30 μg / ml) compared with the Kd value (0.06 μg / ml) in all mouse groups at 15 to 20 weeks of age. Therefore, although the physiological levels of adiponectin are sufficient to activate AMPK and Akt when AdipoR1 is overexpressed in β-cells, yet adiponectin cannot protect β-cells in Akita mice from ER stress-induced destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2782226170,"Jasmonic acid (JA), its derivatives and its precursor cis-12-oxo phytodienoic acid (OPDA) form a group of phytohormones, the jasmonates, representing signal molecules involved in plant stress responses, in the defense against pathogens as well as in development. Elevated levels of JA have been shown to play a role in arbuscular mycorrhiza and in the induction of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. In this study, the gene families of two committed enzymes of the JA biosynthetic pathway, allene oxide synthase (AOS) and allene oxide cyclase (AOC), were characterized in the determinate nodule-forming model legume Lotus japonicus JA levels were to be analysed in the course of nodulation. Since in all L. japonicus organs examined, JA levels increased upon mechanical disturbance and wounding, an aeroponic culture system was established to allow for a quick harvest, followed by the analysis of JA levels in whole root and shoot systems. Nodulated plants were compared with non-nodulated plants grown on nitrate or ammonium as N source, respectively, over a five week-period. JA levels turned out to be more or less stable independently of the growth conditions. However, L. japonicus nodules formed on aeroponically grown plants often showed patches of cells with reduced bacteroid density, presumably a stress symptom. Immunolocalization using a heterologous antibody showed that the vascular systems of these nodules also seemed to contain less AOC protein than those of nodules of plants grown in perlite/vermiculite. Hence, aeroponically grown L. japonicus plants are likely to be habituated to stress which could have affected JA levels."
https://openalex.org/W2781816005,"The increase of leishmaniasis cases worldwide and the emergence of Leishmania strains resistant to current treatments make necessary to find new therapeutic targets. Proteases are appealing drug targets because they play pivotal roles in facilitating parasite survival and promoting pathogenesis. Enzymes belonging to the dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) group have been described in different organisms such as mammals, insects and yeast, in which these enzymes have been involved in both protein turnover and protection against oxidative damage. The aim of this work was to characterize the structure and function of the Leishmania braziliensis DPP3 (LbDPP3) protein as the first step to elucidate its suitability as a potential drug target. Sequence alignment showed 43% of identity between LbDPP3 and its human orthologous (hDPP3) enzyme. Although the modeled protein adopted a globally conserved three-dimensional (3D) structure, structural differences were found in the vicinity of the active site and the substrate binding-cleft. In addition, the Leishmania protein was expressed as a soluble recombinant protein and its kinetics parameters were determined using the z-Arginine-Arginine-AMC substrate. The LbDPP3 activity was maximal at pH values between 8.0-8.5. Interestingly, classical enzyme inhibitors such as the tynorphin and its derivative peptide IVYPW were found to actively inhibit the LbDPP3 activity. Moreover, these DPP3 inhibitors showed a detrimental effect upon parasite survival, decreasing the viability of promastigotes by up to 29%. Finally, it was observed that LbDPP3 was equally expressed along the in vitro differentiation from promastigotes to axenic amastigotes. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the L. brazileinsis DPP3 could be a promising drug target."
https://openalex.org/W2782531092,"It has already been demonstrated that a betasatellite associated with cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMB) can be used as a plant and animal gene delivery vector to plants. To examine the ability of CLCuMB as a tool to transfer coat protein genes of HIV-1 to plants, two recombinant CLCuMB constructs in which the CLCuMB βC1 ORF was replaced with two HIV-1 genes fractions including a 696 bp DNA fragment related to the HIV-1 p24 gene and a 1501 bp DNA fragment related to the HIV-1 gag gene were constructed. Gag is the HIV-1 coat protein gene and p24 is a component of the particle capsid. Gag and p24 are used for vaccine production. Recombinant constructs were inoculated to Nicotiana glutinosa and N. benthamiana plants in the presence of an Iranian isolate of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV-[Ab]) as a helper virus. PCR analysis of inoculated plants indicated that p24 gene was successfully replicated in inoculated plants, but the gag gene was not. Real-time PCR and ELISA analysis of N. glutinosa and N. benthamiana plants containing the replicative forms of recombinant construct of CLCuMB/p24 indicated that p24 was expressed in these plants. This CLCuMB-based expression system offers the possibility of mass production of recombinant HIV-1 p24 protein in plants."

Methods We reviewed the charts of DMD followed at the Home Mechanical Ventilation Unit of the Raymond Poincare University Hospital. Results A total of 121 patients, aged from 18 to 41 years have been included in our study. Median vital capacity (VC) was 12% [7; 19.5] of predicted. Almost all patients were on home mechanical ventilation (95%). LBBB was present in 15 patients (13%); among them, 10 disclosed exonic deletions. After a median follow up of 6 years, 21 patients (17%) experienced acute heart failure (AHF), 7 patients (6%) supraventricular arrhythmia, 3 patients (2.4%) ventricular tachycardia, 4 patients (3%) significant electrical disturbances. LBBB was significantly associated with cardiac events (OR = 12.7; 95%CI [3.78–42.7]; p <0.0001) and mortality (OR = 4.4; 95%CI [1.44–13.7]; p 0.009). Presence of residual dystrophin protein was not associated with significant less cardiac events. Age and LVEF were also predictive factors for cardiac events and mortality. Conclusion LBBB is relatively frequent in DMD and is a major predictive factor for cardiac events and mortality. Presence of residual dystrophin protein was not associated with a lower incidence of cardiac events."
https://openalex.org/W2781742089,"Introduction Raising awareness on a disorder is important for its prevention and for promoting public health. However, for sports injuries like the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury no studies have investigated the awareness on risk factors for injury and possible preventative measures in the general population. The sources of information among the population are also unclear. The purpose of the present study was to identify these aspects of public awareness about the ACL injury. Materials and methods A questionnaire was randomly distributed among the general population registered with a web based questionnaire supplier, to recruit 900 participants who were aware about the ACL injury. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: Question 1 asked them about their sources of information regarding the ACL injury; Question 2 asked them about the risk factors for ACL injury. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the information sources that provide a good understanding of the risk factors. Results and discussion The leading source of information for ACL injury was television (57.0%). However, the results of logistic regression analysis revealed that television was not an effective medium to create awareness about the risk factors, among the general population. Instead “Lecture by a coach”, “Classroom session on Health”, and “Newspaper” were significantly more effective in creating a good awareness of the risk factors (p < 0.001)."
https://openalex.org/W2782092282,"The act of selecting aptamers against blood serum leads to deep libraries of oligonucleotide sequences that bind to a range of epitopes in blood. In this study we developed an enriched aptamer library by performing positive selection against a pool of blood serum samples from transgenic mice (P301S) carrying the human tau gene and counter selecting against pooled blood serum from negative segregant (wild type) mice. We demonstrated that a large proportion of the aptamer sequences observed with next generation sequence (NGS) analysis were the same from selection round 5 and selection round 6. As a second step, we applied aliquots of the selection round 5 enriched library to blood serum from 16 individual mice for a single round of selection. Each of these individual libraries were characterized through NGS analysis and the changes in relative frequency in aptamers from transgenic mice versus wild type were used to construct a diagnostic fingerprint of the effect of the action of the transgene on the composition of blood serum. This study serves as a model for similar applications with human subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2781731994,"Accumulating evidence suggests that the glutamatergic system plays a major role in the pathophysiology of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and empathic processing. Particularly, genetic influence of glutamate transporter gene (SLC1A1) on OCD has been frequently replicated in previous studies, but several studies did not replicate the result. Therefore, we aimed to replicate the associations between the SLC1A1 and OCD in a Korean population. In addition, we investigated the influence of SLC1A1 on trait empathy, impairments in which are characteristic of OCD. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of SLC1A1 were genotyped in 615 patients with OCD and 508 healthy controls. The interpersonal reactivity index (IRI)—which consists of four subscales (perspective taking, PT; fantasy seeking, FS; empathic concern, EC; personal distress, PD)—was assessed from 277 patients with OCD and 395 controls. There were no significant associations between OCD and SNPs or haplotypes of SLC1A1. Patients with OCD exhibited significantly lower PT and higher PD scores than controls. The C-T-G haplotype at rs301430-rs301434-rs3087879 of SLC1A1 was significantly associated with higher PD scores after adjusted for age, sex, and OCD status. Our results suggest that six common SNPs of SLC1A1 may not contribute to the development of OCD, but may contribute to certain aspect of trait empathy such as personal distress. However, insufficient sample size and limited number of SLC1A1 SNPs may have reduced the likelihood of detecting significant associations. Therefore, further studies with larger sample size and more tag SNPs of the SLC1A1 gene were warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2782134239,"Ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are a remarkable regulatory group that may serve as a model for understanding genetic redundancy in evolutionary adaptations. Most RPGs exist as pairs of highly conserved functional paralogs with divergent untranslated regions and introns. We examined the roles of introns in strains with various combinations of intron and gene deletions in RPL22, RPL2, RPL16, RPL37, RPL17, RPS0, and RPS18 paralog pairs. We found that introns inhibited the expression of their genes in the RPL22 pair, with the RPL22B intron conferring a much stronger effect. While the WT RPL22A/RPL22B mRNA ratio was 93/7, the rpl22aΔi/RPL22B and RPL22A/rpl22bΔi ratios were >99/<1 and 60/40, respectively. The intron in RPL2A stimulated the expression of its own gene, but the removal of the other introns had little effect on expression of the corresponding gene pair. Rpl22 protein abundances corresponded to changes in mRNAs. Using splicing reporters containing endogenous intron sequences, we demonstrated that these effects were due to the inhibition of splicing by Rpl22 proteins but not by their RNA-binding mutant versions. Indeed, only WT Rpl22A/Rpl22B proteins (but not the mutants) interacted in a yeast three-hybrid system with an RPL22B intronic region between bp 165 and 236. Transcriptome analysis showed that both the total level of Rpl22 and the A/B ratio were important for maintaining the WT phenotype. The data presented here support the contention that the Rpl22B protein has a paralog-specific role. The RPL22 singleton of Kluyveromyces lactis, which did not undergo whole genome duplication, also responded to Rpl22-mediated inhibition in K. lactis cells. Vice versa, the overproduction of the K. lactis protein reduced the expression of RPL22A/B in S. cerevisiae. The extraribosomal function of of the K. lactis Rpl22 suggests that the loop regulating RPL22 paralogs of S. cerevisiae evolved from autoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2782304253,"Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) can be a non-invasive technique to modulate cognitive functions, with promising therapeutic potential, but with some contradictory results. Event related potentials are used as a marker of brain deterioration and can be used to evaluate TBS-related cognitive performance, but its use remains scant. This study aimed to study bilateral inhibitory and excitatory TBS effects upon neurocognitive performance of young healthy volunteers, using the auditory P300’ results. Using a double-blind sham-controlled study, 51 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to five different groups, two submitted to either excitatory (iTBS) or inhibitory (cTBS) stimulation over the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC), two other actively stimulated the right DLPFC and finally a sham stimulation group. An oddball based auditory P300 was performed just before a single session of iTBS, cTBS or sham stimulation and repeated immediately after. P300 mean latency comparison between the pre- and post-TBS stimulation stages revealed significantly faster post stimulation latencies only when iTBS was performed on the left hemisphere (p = 0.003). Right and left hemisphere cTBS significantly delayed P300 latency (right p = 0.026; left p = 0.000). Multiple comparisons for N200 showed slower latencies after iTBS over the right hemisphere. No significant difference was found in amplitude variation. TBS appears to effectively influence neural networking involved in P300 formation, but effects seem distinct for iTBS vs cTBS and for the right or the left hemisphere. P300 evoked potentials can be an effective and practical tool to evaluate transcranial magnetic stimulation related outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2781661447,"Purpose Choroidal thickness (CT) evaluation with EDI-OCT in Stargardt Disease (STGD), considering its possible association with some clinical features of the disease. Methods CT was evaluated in 41 STGD patients and in 70 controls. Measurements were performed in the subfoveal position and at 1000 μm nasally and temporally. CT average values in STGD and in the control group were first compared by means of Student’s T test. Then, the possible association between CT and some clinical features was evaluated by means of linear regression analysis. Considered clinical parameters were: age, age on onset, duration of the disease, visual acuity, foveal thickness, Fishman clinical phenotype, visual field loss and ERG response. Results Average CT was not significantly different between controls and STGD patients. In the STGD group the correlation between CT and age (r = 0.22, p = 0.033) and age of onset (r = 0.05, p = 0.424) was modest, while that of CT with disease duration (r = 0.30, p<0.001) was moderate. CT and foveal thickness were also significantly but modestly correlated (r = 0.15, p = 0.033). Conclusion In our series average CT is not significantly changed in STGD in comparison with the controls. Nevertheless a choroidal thinning may be identified in the more advanced stages of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2782024620,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen which is often the cause of major morbidity and mortality in both hospital and community settings. For this reason, we investigated the host cell early immune resoponse to S. aureus infection using genome-wide analysis. To do this, we infected Mus musculus RAW264.7 cells with S. aureus alone or in the presence of free peptidoglycan (PG), which appears in the S. aureus cell wall. Post infection, we performed a genome-wide analysis of RAW246.7 cells to identify significant changes in the gene expression profile. Further, we analyzed the infected RAW246.7 cells with transmission electron microscopy looking for the presence of bacterial cells inside the host cell. We also used flow cytometry to determine whether cells had induced apoptosis. The results showed that S. aureus induced apoptosis in the RAW246.7 cells but did not effectively clear away intracellular bacteria cells. However, S. aureus + PG treatment inhibited the apoptosis and activated the host cell inflammation response, possibly involving NF-κB and JAK-STAT pathways, as identified by genome-wide analysis, in RAW246.7 cells. Our study demonstrated for the first time that an independent application of free PG was capable of activating immune responses the host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2781696402,"In femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery, the parameter such as horizontal spot spacing and energy level can be adjusted. Although there have been several studies reported on various laser systems, showing the effects of varying energy levels and horizontal spot spacing on lens capsulotomy cut edges, none have been reported on the Catalys laser system (Abbott Medical Optics, Inc., Santa Ana, CA). The aim of this study is to evaluate, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the quality of the cut edges of the laser lens capsulotomy obtained using the Catalys Laser System, using different horizontal spot spacing and energy levels, and to determine the ideal parameters based on SEM results. Fifty rabbit capsulorhexis specimens from a femtosecond laser with different spot spacing and energy settings were divided into five groups randomly. Spot spacing was 3 um and laser pulse energy was 4 uJ in group 1. The respective values were 5 um and 2 uJ in group 2, 5 um and 4 uJ in group 3, 5 um and 6 uJ in group 4, and 7 um and 4 uJ in group 5. All samples were evaluated using SEM to compare the number of tags per capsulotomy and the laser emission time. Group 1 had a significantly lower tag formation than groups 3 and 5 (P = 0.042 and 0.021, respectively). Although the laser emission time increased about 1.5 sec as the spot spacing increased from 3 to 7 um, the quality of the cut was smoother in group 1 because of overlapping effect of photodisruption cavities. There was no significant difference between groups 2, 3 and 4 at different laser energy settings. In an ex-vivo study, samples from an energy setting of 10 uJ showed increased irregularity and damage. The degree of irregularity was higher at increasing spot spacing and laser energy settings, with abundant tag formation. Dense spot spacing with low-energy settings provide a better cut quality, which is probably correlated with the reduction in anterior capsular tear complications."
https://openalex.org/W2781927317,"Excessive circulating triglycerides due to reduction or loss of lipoprotein lipase activity contribute to hypertriglyceridemia and increased risk for pancreatitis. The only gene therapy treatment for lipoprotein lipase deficiency decreases pancreatitis but minimally reduces hypertriglyceridemia. Synthesized in multiple tissues including striated muscle and adipose tissue, lipoprotein lipase is trafficked to blood vessel endothelial cells where it is anchored at the plasma membrane and hydrolyzes triglycerides into free fatty acids. We conditionally knocked out lipoprotein lipase in differentiated striated muscle tissue lowering striated muscle lipoprotein lipase activity causing hypertriglyceridemia. We then crossed lipoprotein lipase striated muscle knockout mice with mice possessing a conditional avian retroviral receptor gene and injected mice with either a human lipoprotein lipase retrovirus or an mCherry control retrovirus. Post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase activity increased for three weeks following human lipoprotein lipase retroviral infection compared to mCherry infected mice. Human lipoprotein lipase infected mice had significantly lower blood triglycerides compared to mCherry controls and were comparable to wild-type blood triglyceride levels. Thus, targeted delivery of human lipoprotein lipase into striated muscle tissue identifies a potential therapeutic target for lipoprotein lipase deficiency."
