https://openalex.org/W2162109316,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can modulate diverse signaling pathways, often in a ligand-specific manner. The full range of functionally relevant GPCR conformations is poorly understood. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to characterize the conformational dynamics of the transmembrane core of the β(2)-adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR), a prototypical GPCR. We labeled β(2)AR with (13)CH(3)ε-methionine and obtained HSQC spectra of unliganded receptor as well as receptor bound to an inverse agonist, an agonist, and a G-protein-mimetic nanobody. These studies provide evidence for conformational states not observed in crystal structures, as well as substantial conformational heterogeneity in agonist- and inverse-agonist-bound preparations. They also show that for β(2)AR, unlike rhodopsin, an agonist alone does not stabilize a fully active conformation, suggesting that the conformational link between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling surface is not rigid. The observed heterogeneity may be important for β(2)AR's ability to engage multiple signaling and regulatory proteins."

To investigate mechanisms regulating chromatin distribution, we analyzed heterochromatin organization in different tissues and species, including mice with mutations in the lamin B receptor (Lbr) and lamin A (Lmna) genes that encode nuclear envelope (NE) proteins. We identified LBR- and lamin-A/C-dependent mechanisms tethering heterochromatin to the NE. The two tethers are sequentially used during cellular differentiation and development: first the LBR- and then the lamin-A/C-dependent tether. The absence of both LBR and lamin A/C leads to loss of peripheral heterochromatin and an inverted architecture with heterochromatin localizing to the nuclear interior. Myoblast transcriptome analyses indicated that selective disruption of the LBR- or lamin-A-dependent heterochromatin tethers have opposite effects on muscle gene expression, either increasing or decreasing, respectively. These results show how changes in NE composition contribute to regulating heterochromatin positioning, gene expression, and cellular differentiation during development."

Objective To investigate the excess mortality in different diagnostic categories due to suicide and other external causes of death, and due to specific causes in connection with diseases and medical conditions. Methods In longitudinal national psychiatric case registers from Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, a cohort of 270,770 recent-onset patients, who at least once during the period 2000 to 2006 were admitted due to a psychiatric disorder, were followed until death or the end of 2006. They were followed for 912,279 person years, and 28,088 deaths were analyzed. Life expectancy and standardized cause-specific mortality rates were estimated in each diagnostic group in all three countries. Results The life expectancy was generally approximately 15 years shorter for women and 20 years shorter for men, compared to the general population. Mortality due to diseases and medical conditions was increased two- to three-fold, while excess mortality from external causes ranged from three- to 77-fold. Mortality due to diseases and medical conditions was generally lowest in patients with affective disorders and highest in patients with substance abuse and personality disorders, while mortality due to suicide was highest in patients with affective disorders and personality disorders, and mortality due to other external causes was highest in patients with substance abuse. Conclusions These alarming figures call for action in order to prevent the high mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2142713529,"In stressed cells, apoptosis ensues when Bcl-2 family members Bax or Bak oligomerize and permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane. Certain BH3-only relatives can directly activate them to mediate this pivotal, poorly understood step. To clarify the conformational changes that induce Bax oligomerization, we determined crystal structures of BaxΔC21 treated with detergents and BH3 peptides. The peptides bound the Bax canonical surface groove but, unlike their complexes with prosurvival relatives, dissociated Bax into two domains. The structures define the sequence signature of activator BH3 domains and reveal how they can activate Bax via its groove by favoring release of its BH3 domain. Furthermore, Bax helices α2-α5 alone adopted a symmetric homodimer structure, supporting the proposal that two Bax molecules insert their BH3 domain into each other's surface groove to nucleate oligomerization. A planar lipophilic surface on this homodimer may engage the membrane. Our results thus define critical Bax transitions toward apoptosis."

Inactive EGFR can exist as both monomers and dimers, suggesting that the mechanism regulating EGFR activity may be subtle. The membrane itself may play a role but creates substantial difficulties for structural studies. Our molecular dynamics simulations of membrane-embedded EGFR suggest that, in ligand-bound dimers, the extracellular domains assume conformations favoring dimerization of the transmembrane helices near their N termini, dimerization of the juxtamembrane segments, and formation of asymmetric (active) kinase dimers. In ligand-free dimers, by holding apart the N termini of the transmembrane helices, the extracellular domains instead favor C-terminal dimerization of the transmembrane helices, juxtamembrane segment dissociation and membrane burial, and formation of symmetric (inactive) kinase dimers. Electrostatic interactions of EGFR’s intracellular module with the membrane are critical in maintaining this coupling.

These proteins serve as cell-surface receptors for the peptide ligands of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family and play crucial roles in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (Citri and Yarden, 2006Citri A. Yarden Y. EGF-ERBB signalling: towards the systems level.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar); their aberrant activity is implicated in a variety of cancers (Riese et al., 2007Riese 2nd, D.J. Gallo R.M. Settleman J.

Consequently, Her proteins, and EGFR and Her2 in particular, are among the most intensely pursued drug targets. The EGF receptor consists of an extracellular module (comprising domains I, II, III, and IV) and an intracellular kinase domain (with a long regulatory C-terminal tail), which are connected by a single-helix transmembrane segment and a juxtamembrane segment (Figure 1). EGFR activation is dimerization dependent (Schlessinger, 2002Schlessinger J.

At low resolution, detergent-solubilized dimers of nearly full-length receptors have been visualized (Mi et al., 2011Mi L.Z. Lu C. Li Z. Nishida N. Walz T. Springer T.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 30392-30399Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) have shown that EGFR can also exist as preformed dimers in the absence of ligands. A body of experimental evidence shows that the EGFR components that promote the dimerization and activation of the receptors are intertwined with the components that inhibit these processes (Figure 1). Although isolated kinase domains are predominantly monomeric in solution (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. An allosteric mechanism for activation of the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor.Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), they dimerize and activate strongly when the juxtamembrane segments are included (Jura et al., 2009Jura N. Endres N.F. Engel K. Deindl S. Das R. Lamers M.H. Wemmer D.E. Zhang X. Kuriyan J. Mechanism for activation of the EGF receptor catalytic domain by the juxtamembrane segment.Cell. 2009; 137: 1293-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). When such EGFR constructs are localized to cell membranes, however, their activities are abrogated. This surprising finding is reported in this issue of Cell in the accompanying paper by Endres et al., 2013Endres N.F. Das R. Smith A. Arkhipov A. Kovacs E. Huang Y. Pelton J.G. Shan Y.B. Shaw D.E. Wemmer D.E. et al.Conformational coupling across the plasma membrane in activation of the EGF receptor.Cell. 2013; 152 (this issue): 543-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, which also shows that the activity may be recovered by the addition of the transmembrane segments and abrogated at low expression levels by the further addition of the extracellular domains. These findings suggest that the transmembrane and juxtamembrane segments on balance favor EGFR activation, whereas the kinase domain, the extracellular domains, and the EGFR interaction with the cell membrane contribute to EGFR autoinhibition. Although ligand binding enhances dimerization of the extracellular domains only modestly in solution (Odaka et al., 1997Odaka M. Kohda D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. Ligand-binding enhances the affinity of dimerization of the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor.J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), at the cell surface, it can tip the balance decisively toward activation. The structural basis of these findings is uncertain, however, because the architecture of intact EGFR remains obscure. Various experiments have suggested the need to take the cell membranes into account (Bessman and Lemmon, 2012Bessman N.J. Lemmon M.A. Finding the missing links in EGFR.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but this presents a formidable challenge to structural analysis. One key problem is the relatively poor understanding of the crucial middle sections of EGFR that are embedded in, or adjacent to, the cell membrane. It has been proposed that, in EGFR dimers, the transmembrane helices alternate between two dimer forms, one associated with inactive and the other with active EGFR dimers (Fleishman et al., 2002Fleishman S.J. Schlessinger J. Ben-Tal N. A putative molecular-activation switch in the transmembrane domain of erbB2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 15937-15940Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), although direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. Although the juxtamembrane segments promote the dimerization and activation of EGFR kinases (Jura et al., 2009Jura N. Endres N.F. Engel K. Deindl S. Das R. Lamers M.H. Wemmer D.E. Zhang X. Kuriyan J. Mechanism for activation of the EGF receptor catalytic domain by the juxtamembrane segment.Cell. 2009; 137: 1293-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar; Red Brewer et al., 2009Red Brewer M. Choi S.H. Alvarado D. Moravcevic K. Pozzi A. Lemmon M.A. Carpenter G. The juxtamembrane region of the EGF receptor functions as an activation domain.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 641-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the structural mechanism that couples the trans- and juxtamembrane segments is not understood. The preformed dimers present another key problem. Although inactive EGFR is usually present as monomers in normal cells, at higher levels of expression, inactive, preformed dimers are commonly observed, and knowledge of their structure could shed light on the mechanisms by which EGFR activity is controlled. Their structure, however, remains unknown, although the observation that preformed dimers are primed for ligand binding (Chung et al., 2010Chung I. Akita R. Vandlen R. Toomre D. Schlessinger J. Mellman I. Spatial control of EGF receptor activation by reversible dimerization on living cells.Nature. 2010; 464: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) hints at a potentially close structural relationship to the active dimer in its extracellular domains. The existence of inactive dimers suggests a tight conformational coupling between the extra- and intracellular domains to prevent kinase activity in the absence of ligand, but puzzlingly, the dimerization of the extracellular domains and the dimerization of the intracellular kinase domains are not necessarily correlated, as shown by experiments on intact EGFRs in detergent micelles (Mi et al., 2011Mi L.Z. Lu C. Li Z. Nishida N. Walz T. Springer T.A. Simultaneous visualization of the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of the epidermal growth factor receptor.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2011Wang Z. Longo P.A. Tarrant M.K. Kim K. Head S. Leahy D.J. Cole P.A. Mechanistic insights into the activation of oncogenic forms of EGF receptor.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 1388-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). One possibility is that embedding EGFR in detergent micelles alters the receptor’s behavior in important ways (Bessman and Lemmon, 2012Bessman N.J. Lemmon M.A. Finding the missing links in EGFR.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that a structural understanding of signal transduction may need to take the membrane environment into account. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the overall architecture of EGFR and its interaction with the membrane to understand the cross-membrane coupling in these receptors. We adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy, initiating our model building with simulations of individual EGFR components in various contexts. Guided by observations from these simulations and by insights gained from coordinated experimental work described in the companion paper (Endres et al., 2013Endres N.F. Das R. Smith A. Arkhipov A. Kovacs E. Huang Y. Pelton J.G. Shan Y.B. Shaw D.E. Wemmer D.E. et al.Conformational coupling across the plasma membrane in activation of the EGF receptor.Cell. 2013; 152 (this issue): 543-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), the components were then assembled into larger models, the simulations of which helped motivate further experimental work. We ultimately constructed and characterized nearly full-length models for the monomer, the ligand-free, inactive dimer, and the ligand-bound, active dimer. In simulations of the extracellular portion of a ligand-bound EGFR dimer, we found that the extracellular domains remained close to the (active) crystal structure but that this structure was no longer stable when the bound EGF ligands were removed. In particular, the two domain IVs underwent a conformational change that substantially increased the distance between their C termini. Because, in intact EGFR, the domain IVs are directly linked to the transmembrane domains, these extracellular domain simulations shed light on how ligand binding may be coupled to the arrangement of the transmembrane helices. Further simulations, together with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mutagenesis data (Endres et al., 2013Endres N.F. Das R. Smith A. Arkhipov A. Kovacs E. Huang Y. Pelton J.G. Shan Y.B. Shaw D.E. Wemmer D.E. et al.Conformational coupling across the plasma membrane in activation of the EGF receptor.Cell. 2013; 152 (this issue): 543-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), demonstrated that the transmembrane helices may dimerize either near their N or C termini. The data further showed that antiparallel juxtamembrane helix dimers coexist with N-terminal transmembrane dimers but are incompatible with the C-terminal transmembrane dimers. Our simulations showed that, when the juxtamembrane dimers are disrupted, the juxtamembrane segments become embedded in the membrane. Consistent with earlier findings by Jura et al., 2009Jura N. Endres N.F. Engel K. Deindl S. Das R. Lamers M.H. Wemmer D.E. Zhang X. Kuriyan J. Mechanism for activation of the EGF receptor catalytic domain by the juxtamembrane segment.Cell. 2009; 137: 1293-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, we show that a juxtamembrane helix dimer is compatible with the asymmetric kinase dimer and, hence, with EGFR activation. We find membrane-embedded juxtamembrane segments, on the other hand, to be compatible with both the symmetric kinase dimer and EGFR monomers and, thus, with EGFR autoinhibition. Combining these findings, we propose a structural mechanism that enables the receptors to relay signals across the membrane. Notably, the simulations indicate that membrane lipids, especially anionic lipids, interact extensively with the receptors and are integral to signal transduction. A detailed description of EGFR-membrane interaction from these simulations provides a mechanistic understanding of a dual role for anionic lipids in EGFR regulation in both inhibiting EGFR in the absence of ligand stimulus and in accentuating EGFR response to a stimulus. In the ligand-bound extracellular EGFR dimer, each subunit binds one ligand between domains I and III and adopts an extended conformation (Figure 2; Garrett et al., 2002Garrett T.P.J. McKern N.M.

Mi L.Z. Grey M.J. Zhu J. Graef E. Yokoyama S. Springer T.A. Structural evidence for loose linkage between ligand binding and kinase activation in the epidermal growth factor receptor.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5432-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligands, monomeric extracellular domains may assume a “tethered” conformation (Cho and Leahy, 2002Cho H.S. Leahy D.J. Structure of the extracellular region of HER3 reveals an interdomain tether.Science. 2002; 297: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar; Ferguson et al., 2003Ferguson K.M.

Cell. 2003; 11: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) that precludes dimerization. This conformation is characterized by a wide separation of domains I and III and the tether interaction between domain IV and the dimerization arm of domain II (Figure 2). EGFR, however, can dimerize prior to EGF binding, suggesting that the extracellular domains in monomeric EGFR may adopt conformations other than tethered. To investigate these conformations, we first simulated the monomer starting from the tethered conformation, in which, on a timescale of microseconds, the “tether” readily disengaged, but domains II and IV remained in extensive contact, shielding the dimerization arm (Figure 2A). Thus, our simulations suggest a limited role of the tether in EGFR autoinhibition, which is consistent with experimental findings (Mattoon et al., 2004Mattoon D. Klein P. Lemmon M.A. Lax I. Schlessinger J. The tethered configuration of the EGF receptor extracellular domain exerts only a limited control of receptor function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Bouyain S. Eigenbrot C. Leahy D.J. The ErbB4 extracellular region retains a tethered-like conformation in the absence of the tether.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 152-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Simulations of monomeric extracellular domains were also initiated from the extended conformation (both with and without EGF bound). These simulations demonstrated a significant conformational change occurring within 1–5 μs, in which the C terminus of the extracellular domains traveled a distance of ∼80 Å (Figure 2B). This happened largely as a result of the bending of domain IV around a “hinge” (residues 502–514), which produced a compact conformation of the extracellular domains not yet captured by crystallography, which resembled the extended conformation in domains I–III, and the tethered conformation in domain IV. The instability of the extended conformation for EGFR monomers confirms that the extracellular domains in monomers generally adopt compact conformations (Du et al., 2012Du Y. Yang H. Xu Y. Cang X. Luo C. Mao Y. Wang Y. Qin G. Luo X. Jiang H. Conformational transition and energy landscape of ErbB4 activated by neuregulin1β: one microsecond molecular dynamics simulations.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; 134: 6720-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast to the instability of the extended conformation of extracellular monomers, the extended conformation of the two subunits in a ligand-bound dimer (the “two-ligand dimer”) remained stable in our simulations, which is consistent with the stabilizing effect of ligand binding to EGFR active dimers (Figure S1 available online). EGFR can also form ligand-free dimers that presumably need to be autoinhibited in normal cells. Because the crystal structure of the ligand-free extracellular dimer is not yet available for human EGFR, we attempted to investigate the structure using MD simulations. From the notion that the inactive dimers are primed for ligand binding (Chung et al., 2010Chung I. Akita R. Vandlen R. Toomre D. Schlessinger J. Mellman I. Spatial control of EGF receptor activation by reversible dimerization on living cells.Nature. 2010; 464: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar; Sako et al., 2000Sako Y. Minoghchi S. Yanagida T. Single-molecule imaging of EGFR signalling on the surface of living cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that their extracellular domains bear structural resemblance to the active structure. We thus performed simulations based on the crystal structure of the two-ligand extracellular dimer. First, the crystal structure was simulated after one ligand was removed. In the simulation, the gap left by the removed ligand (Figure 3) was filled by domains I and III, which came into contact with each other. The resultant conformation of the ligand-free subunit bears significant similarity in domains I–III (Figure 3) to the ligand-free structures of Her2 (Cho et al., 2003Cho H.S. Mason K. Ramyar K.X.

Moreover, we observed a rotation of one subunit with respect to the dimerization arm of the other (Figures 3B and S1E), reflecting a transition between the “staggered” and the “flush” conformations (Liu et al., 2012bLiu P.

The final conformation of the one-ligand dimer simulation is used to initiate the simulation of the ligand-free dimer (right). The two domain IVs undergo a significant movement in the one-ligand dimer simulation, but not in the two-ligand or ligand-free dimer simulations.

The final conformation of the one-ligand dimer simulation is used to initiate the simulation of the ligand-free dimer (right). The two domain IVs undergo a significant movement in the one-ligand dimer simulation, but not in the two-ligand or ligand-free dimer simulations. This results in a greater distance between the C termini (dCC) in the one-ligand and ligand-free dimers than in the two-ligand dimer. (B) Side views of the dimer conformations. Transitions from the “Staggered” toward the “Flush” conformation (Liu et al., 2012bLiu P. Cleveland 4th, T.E. Bouyain S. Byrne P.O. Longo P.A. Leahy D.J. A single ligand is sufficient to activate EGFR dimers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The dashed lines here indicate the principal axes of the domain IIs. See also Figure S1 and Movie S1. Perhaps more importantly, the rearrangement of domains I and III led to a “bending” motion at domain IV (Movie S1) around the hinge region in the ligand-free subunit of the “one-ligand dimer” (where only one EGFR subunit is ligand bound), reminiscent of the “bending” in monomeric extracellular domains (Figure 2B). The bent domain IV was observed to occasionally return to its initial conformation (Figure S1), likely reflecting a fluctuation between the two conformations in a one-ligand dimer. To further investigate the conformation of the ligand-free extracellular dimer, we removed the remaining ligand from the one-ligand extracellular dimer. Starting with a bent domain IV, subsequent simulations did not exhibit significant conformational changes, suggesting that a bent domain IV is stable in the absence of bound ligands in the dimer (Figures 3 and S1). Our results thus suggest that the removal of bound ligands results in significant rearrangement of the domain IVs. Instead of a V-shape arrangement of domain IVs in the two-ligand dimer, in the new arrangement, they adopt an antiparallel arrangement with a distance of ∼45 Å between the two C-terminal ends (dCC), which is significantly greater than the distance in the two-ligand dimers (10 Å in crystal structures and ∼30 Å on average in our simulations; Figure S1E). The distance dCC is important because, by altering it, the extracellular domains may communicate with the one-pass transmembrane helices and ultimately the cytoplasmic portion of the EGFR dimer. The basic observation concerning dCC was found to be robust to the choice of force field in our simulations (Supplemental Information). The transmembrane segment connects the extra- and intracellular domains. We expect that the transmembrane conformations in active and inactive EGFR dimers differ in ways that place substantial constraints on the possible structures of the intra- and extracellular modules. An EGFR transmembrane helix contains two GxxxG-like motifs (where the G represents a glycine or other small amino acid): one close to the N terminus (TGMVGA, residues 624–629, which itself comprises two overlapping GxxxG-like motifs) and the other to the C terminus (ALGIG, residues 637–641). Because GxxxG motifs often serve as dimerization interfaces of transmembrane helices (Lemmon et al., 1994Lemmon M.A. Treutlein H.R. Adams P.D. Brünger A.T. Engelman D.M.

The intracellular portion of the receptor is intrinsically active in solution, and to study its regulation, we measured autophosphorylation as a function of EGFR surface density in cells. Without EGF, intact EGFR escapes inhibition only at high surface densities. Although the transmembrane helix and the intracellular module together suffice for constitutive activity even at low densities, the intracellular module is inactivated when tethered on its own to the plasma membrane, and fluorescence cross-correlation shows that it fails to dimerize. NMR and functional data indicate that activation requires an N-terminal interaction between the transmembrane helices, which promotes an antiparallel interaction between juxtamembrane segments and release of inhibition by the membrane. We conclude that EGF binding removes steric constraints in the extracellular module, promoting activation through N-terminal association of the transmembrane helices.

Interactions with the membrane help suppress ligand-independent EGFR activation Dependence of EGFR activation on cell surface density reveals control mechanisms Intrinsic dimerization of the cytoplasmic module is suppressed at the membrane Activation requires structural coupling of transmembrane and juxtamembrane segments Receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), play critical roles in regulating metabolism, growth, and differentiation (Hubbard and Till, 2000Hubbard S.R.

A single transmembrane helix in these receptors connects an N-terminal extracellular ligand-binding module to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Ligand binding increases catalytic activity in the kinase domains and leads to phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues. In EGFR, these tyrosines are principally located in a long C-terminal tail. In this paper and in a companion paper in this issue of Cell (Arkhipov et al., 2013Arkhipov A. Shan Y. Das R. Endres N.F.

EGFR was the first growth factor receptor demonstrated to undergo ligand-dependent dimerization (Yarden and Schlessinger, 1987Yarden Y. Schlessinger J.

A critical step in EGFR activation is the formation of an asymmetric dimer of kinase domains (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J.

Activation through asymmetric homo- or heterodimerization underlies the combinatorial activation of EGFR and its close relatives Her2, Her3, and Her4 (Jura et al., 2011Jura N. Zhang X. Endres N.F.

It is natural to think that ligand-driven dimerization of EGFR simply converts inactive monomers into active dimeric receptors, but the mechanism cannot be so simple. The isolated intracellular module of the receptor (consisting of the juxtamembrane segment, kinase domain, and C-terminal tail) is active at relatively low concentrations in solution (<1 μM) (Jura et al., 2009Jura N.

This is a consequence of the juxtamembrane segments stabilizing the asymmetric dimer necessary for activity (Jura et al., 2009Jura N. Endres N.F. Engel K. Deindl S. Das R. Lamers M.H. Wemmer D.E.

The C-terminal portion of the juxtamembrane segment (denoted JM-B) of the receiver kinase latches onto the activator kinase domain (Figure 1A). The N-terminal portion of the juxtamembrane segment (JM-A) is thought to form an antiparallel helical association between subunits, further stabilizing the asymmetric dimer (Jura et al., 2009Jura N.

Clearly, the responsiveness of the receptor to ligand implies that the intrinsic activity of the intracellular module is suppressed in some way when the ligand is not bound. EGFR family members are prone to ligand-independent dimerization and activation at high expression levels (Nagy et al., 2010Nagy P. Claus J. Jovin T.M. Arndt-Jovin D.J.

The coupled equilibria governing EGFR activation, incorporating both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent dimerization, are diagrammed in Figure 1A (Yarden and Schlessinger, 1987Yarden Y.

This diagram omits the formation of higher-order oligomers (Clayton et al., 2008Clayton A.H. Orchard S.G. Nice E.C. Posner R.G. Burgess A.W.

We now present an experimental analysis of EGFR activation aimed at understanding how the conformations of the extracellular and intracellular module are coupled. The companion paper presents the results of molecular dynamics simulations of the receptor in lipid bilayers (Arkhipov et al., 2013Arkhipov A. Shan Y. Das R. Endres N.F. Eastwood M.P. Wemmer D.E. Kuriyan J. Shaw D.E. Architecture and membrane interactions of the EGF receptor.Cell. 2013; 152 (this issue): 557-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), which provided a framework for interpreting some of our experimental results. We begin by using immunofluorescence to measure EGFR autophosphorylation as a function of receptor surface density in cells. Our data lead to the unexpected conclusion that the intrinsic activity of the intracellular module is inhibited when it is tethered to the plasma membrane. We show, using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS), that the inhibition of the intracellular module at the membrane is due to a failure to dimerize. These data point to a critical role for the transmembrane helix in dimerizing and activating the intracellular module, but the role of the transmembrane helix in EGFR activation is poorly understood (Lu et al., 2010Lu C. Mi L.Z. Grey M.J. Zhu J. Graef E. Yokoyama S. Springer T.A. Structural evidence for loose linkage between ligand binding and kinase activation in the epidermal growth factor receptor.Mol. Cell.

We address this by using NMR to analyze the structure of the transmembrane and juxtamembrane segments of EGFR in lipid bilayers. An essential part of our analysis is to determine the activity of the receptor in cells as a function of its density on the plasma membrane. To do this, we transiently transfected Cos-7 cells with various EGFR constructs fused to mCherry, and monitored phosphorylation at a specific residue in the C-terminal tail (Tyr 1068) using fluorescent phosphospecific antibodies (Figure 2A; Experimental Procedures). Due to the morphology of Cos-7 cells, which resembles that of a fried egg, we could focus our analysis on plasma-membrane-localized EGFR by selecting regions at the periphery of the cells (Figure S1 available online). By calibrating our microscope to relate the fluorescence intensity of EGFR in these peripheral regions to its surface density (Galush et al., 2008Galush W.J. Nye J.A. Groves J.T. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy using supported lipid bilayer standards.Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 2512-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we obtain a cell-by-cell quantification of the relative tyrosine phosphorylation level as a function of the surface density of EGFR at the plasma membrane (Figure S2A).Figure S1Estimation of the Cytoplasmic Fraction of Myr-ICM, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Diagram demonstrating how the contribution of cytoplasmic protein to total intensity depends on the thickness of the cell.

For the TM-ICM construct, note that at the cell periphery despite weak localization of TM-ICM, the phosphorylation of Tyr 1068 is still strong. Errors bars represent the standard error of the mean. The dependence of EGFR activation on surface density, averaged over many cells (∼100), is shown in Figure 2B for Tyr 1068. In cells treated with EGF for short times (3–5 min) to minimize receptor internalization (Sorkin and Goh, 2009Sorkin A. Goh L.K. Endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of ErbBs.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), the relative phosphorylation level per molecule is independent of the receptor surface density over the experimental range considered (50–2,000 receptors per μm2) (right panel, Figure 2B). This indicates that EGF binding is sufficient to trigger phosphorylation, even at the lowest surface densities observed in our study. In the absence of EGF, the relative phosphorylation level per receptor increases with receptor surface density, reaching values at the highest densities that are comparable to those obtained upon EGF stimulation. At a surface density of ∼1,400 receptors per μm2, the mean phosphorylation level of the unliganded receptor is roughly half of that observed when EGF is added (Figure 2B). This density is equivalent to a local concentration of kinase domains of ∼200 μM (Extended Experimental Procedures), ∼100-fold higher than that required for robust activation of the intracellular module in solution (Jura et al., 2009Jura N. Endres N.F. Engel K. Deindl S. Das R. Lamers M.H. Wemmer D.E. Zhang X. Kuriyan J. Mechanism for activation of the EGF receptor catalytic domain by the juxtamembrane segment.Cell. 2009; 137: 1293-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The level of EGF-independent phosphorylation of the receptor is essentially the same as the EGF-induced level when the surface density of the receptor becomes higher than ∼2,000 receptors per μm2, which corresponds to ∼1.3 million receptors per cell (Extended Experimental Procedures). This is comparable to the levels of EGFR expression reported in cancer cells that overexpress EGFR (Haigler et al., 1978Haigler H. Ash J.F. Singer S.J. Cohen S. Visualization by fluorescence of the binding and internalization of epidermal growth factor in human carcinoma cells A-431.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). EGF-independent activation at high expression levels requires formation of the asymmetric dimer. Introduction of the V924R mutation, which disrupts the interface between the activator and receiver kinases in the asymmetric dimer (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J.

There is a modest increase in phosphorylation level upon EGF treatment in cells expressing the V924R mutant, but this increase is independent of surface density and is probably due to low levels of endogenous EGFR. A similar dependence of phosphorylation level on surface density is seen when other tyrosine residues are monitored (such as Tyr 1173, Figure S2B). We observe the same general pattern when we examine these cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), with formation of the asymmetric dimer being required (Figure S2D). Because FACS analysis does not provide an easy way to distinguish between expression of constructs at the cell surface and on internal membranes, we focus primarily on results from immunofluorescence microscopy. Deletion of the extracellular module activates EGFR, although it is not clear whether this effect is restricted to high levels of receptor expression (Chantry, 1995Chantry A.

This specifically localized glycolytic machinery may supply constant energy, independent of mitochondria, for the processive movement of vesicles over long distances in axons. Fast axonal transport (FAT) depends on glycolytic ATP Motile vesicles contain glycolytic enzymes and produce ATP Huntingtin protein scaffolds GAPDH on vesicles Vesicular GAPDH is necessary and sufficient to support FAT of vesicles Fast axonal transport (FAT) is mediated by the molecular motors dynein and kinesin that transport cargos over long distances in neurons (Hirokawa et al., 2010Hirokawa N. Niwa S. Tanaka Y. Molecular motors in neurons: transport mechanisms and roles in brain function, development, and disease.Neuron. 2010; 68: 610-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). This extremely rapid and efficient transport is essential to deliver molecules such as trophic factors to nerve terminals that can be distant up to 1 m from cell bodies in the case of human motor neurons (Salinas et al., 2008Salinas S. Bilsland L.G. Schiavo G. Molecular landmarks along the axonal route: axonal transport in health and disease.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). FAT consumes energy because the dynein and kinesin motors require ATP to transport cargos along microtubules. Because kinesin hydrolyses one ATP per 8 nm step (Gennerich and Vale, 2009Gennerich A. Vale R.D. Walking the walk: how kinesin and dynein coordinate their steps.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), nerve cells must have energy sources distributed throughout their axons for these molecular motors to function. Glucose is the major source of brain energy and is required for normal brain function. Glucose breakdown occurs in the cytosol through the glycolytic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate and generates free energy (Ames, 2000Ames 3rd, A. CNS energy metabolism as related to function.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 34: 42-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The net energetic balance of glycolysis is relatively low, with two ATP being produced from one molecule of glucose. In contrast to glycolysis, mitochondria produce 34 ATP molecules (Ames, 2000Ames 3rd, A. CNS energy metabolism as related to function.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 34: 42-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and provide most of the energy used by the brain. However, mitochondria are not evenly distributed within neurons, and are most abundant at sites with a high-energy demand such as synapses and nodes of Ranvier (MacAskill and Kittler, 2010MacAskill A.F. Kittler J.T. Control of mitochondrial transport and localization in neurons.Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 102-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). One fundamental requirement for efficient FAT is a constant supply of ATP. How is ATP distributed within neurons to fuel the molecular motors? It also remains to be understood how ATP can be continuously provided to fast-moving vesicles in axonal segments devoid of mitochondria. These questions are of particular importance in the context of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases, which are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and axonal transport defects (Hirokawa et al., 2010Hirokawa N. Niwa S. Tanaka Y.

Bilsland L.G. Schiavo G. Molecular landmarks along the axonal route: axonal transport in health and disease.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the relative contributions of glycolysis and the mitochondrial respiratory chain in supplying ATP for FAT. To reliably analyze vesicular FAT, we designed microfluidic-based devices derived from a previously described microfluidic culture platform (Taylor et al., 2005Taylor A.M. Blurton-Jones M. Rhee S.W. Cribbs D.H. Cotman C.W. Jeon N.L. A microfluidic culture platform for CNS axonal injury, regeneration and transport.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Embryonic rat cortical neurons can extend long processes into the channels, but only axons can reach the distal chamber located 450 μm away from the proximal chamber containing the cell bodies and most of the dendrites, as shown by Tau staining (Figure S1A available online). We electroporated cortical neurons with fluorescent-tagged cargos and plated the neurons in microchambers. We performed FAT assays 3–5 days after the cells were plated, when axons had reached the distal chamber. We used brain-derived neurotrophic factor tagged with mCherry (BDNF-mCherry), which displays the characteristic features of a FAT-dependent cargo and retains BDNF function (Kwinter et al., 2009Kwinter D.M. Lo K. Mafi P. Silverman M.A. Dynactin regulates bidirectional transport of dense-core vesicles in the axon and dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuroscience. 2009; 162: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To selectively analyze axonal transport, we recorded vesicular dynamics in the distal part of the microchannels and generated kymographs from the video recordings. Analyzes of BDNF vesicle dynamics revealed fast and highly processive anterograde and retrograde movements (Figure 1A; Movie S1) at velocities similar to those previously reported (Kwinter et al., 2009Kwinter D.M.

(D) Perceval signal reveals small fluctuations of the ATP:ADP ratio within axons whereas the pH ratio remained constant. See also Figure S1. To analyze the distribution of mitochondria and of the key glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the microfluidic devices, we used a mitochondrial signal peptide fused to dsRed (Mito-DR) and GAPDH tagged with GFP (GADPH-GFP) and verified that the respective behaviors of these constructs in axons grown in microchannels were similar to that in cultured neurons. As previously reported (Miller and Sheetz, 2004Miller K.E. Sheetz M.P. Axonal mitochondrial transport and potential are correlated.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2791-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar; Tristan et al., 2011Tristan C. Shahani N. Sedlak T.W. Sawa A. The diverse functions of GAPDH: views from different subcellular compartments.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), mitochondria were abundant in cell bodies and discontinuously distributed in neurites, whereas GAPDH was diffused throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 1B). The same pattern of distribution was observed in axons extending within the microchannels (Figure 1B). Mitochondria exhibited characteristic dynamic behavior within the microchambers, and were either stationary, very dynamic, or changing directions (Movie S2) as illustrated by the two-color kymograph (Figure 1B). We also investigated the trafficking of BDNF-mCherry-containing vesicles and of mitochondria in the same axons and found no overlap between stationary or dynamic populations (Figure S1B). In contrast to mitochondria, GAPDH was diffuse throughout the cytosol of the chambered axons and its distribution did not appear to change over time (Figure 1B). Although there are many reliable methods to measure ATP content within cells, the subcellular location of ATP is more difficult to resolve. To selectively determine changes in ATP content within axons, we took advantage of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that monitors ATP:ADP ratio in living cells (Berg et al., 2009Berg J. Hung Y.P. Yellen G. A genetically encoded fluorescent reporter of ATP:ADP ratio.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The ATP:ADP ratio was constant over long distances within the axons (Figures 1C and 1D). As the signal emitted by Perceval is pH-dependent, we measured possible variations in intracellular pH using the SNARF 5 probe and observed no major fluctuations throughout the axons. This suggests that there is a constant availability in ATP within axons that is provided by both mitochondria and glycolysis. We next determined whether mitochondrial H+-ATP-synthase inhibition by oligomycin, which blocks ATP production from the mitochondria (Chang and Reynolds, 2006Chang D.T. Reynolds I.J. Mitochondrial trafficking and morphology in healthy and injured neurons.Prog. Neurobiol. 2006; 80: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), or whether GAPDH inhibition by iodoacetate affected FAT in cultured cortical neurons. We first measured the efficacy of oligomycin and iodoacetate in modulating ATP content within neurons. We added 1 mM pyruvate to the iodoacetate-treated neurons to bypass glycolysis and to allow mitochondria to continue to produce ATP. A 5 min treatment with oligomycin (20 μM) induced a 25% reduction in ATP that reached to 80% after 30 min (Figure 2A). In contrast, a 30 min iodoacetate treatment that leads to a strong inhibition of GAPDH (Figure 2B) reduced ATP by only 40%. We next measured ATP:ADP ratio using Perceval as in Figure 1A. We observed a dynamic response in the Perceval signal that correlated with the ATP content as measured within neuronal extracts. Oligomycin treatment produced a progressive and substantial reduction in the Perceval signal, whereas iodoacetate treatment was not as effective (Figure 2C). These results indicate that most of the ATP in neurons originated from the mitochondria and that mitochondria inhibition rather than GAPDH inhibition significantly reduced the ATP level in neurons. We next assessed BDNF vesicle dynamics in these conditions. After 30 min oligomycin treatment, when ATP is maximally reduced (Figure 2A), mean anterograde and retrograde vesicle velocity was unaffected and the percentage of dynamic vesicles remained constant (Figures 2D and S2A). We next treated neurons with iodoacetate and pyruvate. In contrast to oligomycin-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial ATP, GAPDH inhibition reduced FAT of BDNF vesicles after as little as 5 min of iodoacetate treatment as shown in the kymograph and by the reduction in the velocities and dynamics of BDNF (Figures 2D and S2A; Movie S1). In support for a specific effect of iodoacetate, we found a 50% inhibition of FAT when using its IC50 concentration (Schmidt and Dringen, 2009Schmidt M.M. Dringen R. Differential effects of iodoacetamide and iodoacetate on glycolysis and glutathione metabolism of cultured astrocytes.Front Neuroenergetics. 2009; 1: 1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure S2B). Although oligomycin had no effect on vesicle transport, it rapidly blocked mitochondria trafficking (Figures 2E and S2C; Movie S2). On the other hand, iodoacetate had no effect on mitochondria dynamics even after 30 min of treatment. This indicates the lack of off-target effects of iodoacetate on molecular motors because the same motors are used for mitochondria and vesicles (Hirokawa et al., 2010Hirokawa N. Niwa S. Tanaka Y. Molecular motors in neurons: transport mechanisms and roles in brain function, development, and disease.Neuron. 2010; 68: 610-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with previous studies indicating that loss of mitochondrial ATP production, but not the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential or mitochondria morphology can induce the loss of mitochondria dynamics (Kaasik et al., 2007Kaasik A. Safiulina D. Choubey V. Kuum M. Zharkovsky A. Veksler V. Mitochondrial swelling impairs the transport of organelles in cerebellar granule neurons.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32821-32826Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar; Rintoul et al., 2003Rintoul G.L. Filiano A.J. Brocard J.B. Kress G.J. Reynolds I.J. Glutamate decreases mitochondrial size and movement in primary forebrain neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7881-7888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these experiments suggest that GAPDH rather than mitochondria is critical for FAT. We next took advantage of the identification of two mitochondria adaptor proteins, milton and Miro (Glater et al., 2006Glater E.E. Megeath L.J. Stowers R.S. Schwarz T.L. Axonal transport of mitochondria requires milton to recruit kinesin heavy chain and is light chain independent.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar; Wang and Schwarz, 2009Wang X. Schwarz T.L. The mechanism of Ca2+ -dependent regulation of kinesin-mediated mitochondrial motility.Cell. 2009; 136: 163-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), to specifically deplete mitochondria from axons and redistribute them into the cell bodies. Indeed, milton knockout flies show no mitochondria in their axons but have a normal axonal distribution of vesicles. This suggested that transport of vesicles may not strictly depend on mitochondria. Previous work showed that milton-C expression in neurons redistributes mitochondria into the cell bodies but does not alter mitochondria function (Glater et al., 2006Glater E.E. Megeath L.J. Stowers R.S. Schwarz T.L. Axonal transport of mitochondria requires milton to recruit kinesin heavy chain and is light chain independent.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We therefore expressed milton-C in cortical neurons and observed that mitochondria clustered within cell bodies so that axons were depleted of mitochondria (Figure 3A). By transfecting Perceval into neurons, we observed a progressive but marked reduction of ATP:ADP ratio within axons of neurons coexpressing milton-C whereas the ratio in the cell body remained high (Figure 3B). We next coexpressed milton-C, GFP, and mito-DR in neurons and plated them in microchambers. Having verified that mitochondria were also absent from axons in microchannels as a result of milton-C expression (Figure 3C), we assessed BDNF vesicle dynamics in neurons expressing milton-C and BDNF-mCherry. To make sure these axons are depleted from mitochondria, we added mitotracker to the medium and recorded vesicular transport in the distal part of the mitochondria-depleted axons. We found that the velocities of vesicles were largely unaffected (Figure 3D) compared to control neurons (Figure 1A). Our results indicate that BDNF vesicles can move efficiently in axons both devoid of mitochondria and with reduced ATP:ADP ratio. We plated on coverslips cortical neurons silenced for GAPDH with a siRNA that specifically targets rat GAPDH mRNA. GAPDH knockdown substantially reduced GAPDH protein levels as shown by immunoblot analyzes (Figure 4A). We observed a significant reduction in both anterograde and retrograde transport of BDNF vesicles in GAPDH-silenced neurons (Figures 4B and 4C). We also silenced GAPDH with another siRNA sequence in cortical neurons that were plated in microchambers (Figure S3A). As with the first siRNA (Figures 4A–4C), we observed a significant decrease in transport (Figures S3B and S3C). To verify the efficacy of the two siRNAs, we determined GAPDH activity and protein levels and observed a similar reduction (Figure S3D). Finally, to control for any possible off-target effects, we restored GADPH protein levels in siRNA-treated neurons by coexpressing a mouse GAPDH-GFP construct that was insensitive to the rat GAPDH siRNA (Figure 4A). We observed a complete recovery of normal BDNF vesicle dynamics in axons (Figures 4B and 4C).Figure S3GAPDH Silencing Reduces GAPDH Levels and Enzymatic Activity and Decreases FAT, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Immunoblotting analysis of rat cortical neurons extracts showing GAPDH silencing with siGAPDH II.(B) Quantification of mean velocities from kymographs of control neurons and GAPDH silenced neurons with siGAPDH II.

Besides its role in glycolysis, GAPDH functions in other cellular processes such as DNA repair, membrane fusion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell death (Tristan et al., 2011Tristan C. Shahani N. Sedlak T.W. Sawa A. The diverse functions of GAPDH: views from different subcellular compartments.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of silencing GAPDH on FAT is linked to its glycolytic activity, we coexpressed a siRNA-insensitive and catalytically inactive form of GADPH (GAPDH-GFP-C149G) (Figure 4A). In contrast to GAPDH-GFP, the catalytically inactive construct was unable to restore the defective axonal transport induced by the siRNA (Figures 4B and 4C). These results indicate that catalytically active GAPDH is required for FAT and that the mechanism involves sustained glycolytic activity. We next analyzed the consequences of GAPDH silencing on the transport of other cargos. As for iodoacetate treatment we found no effect on mitochondria dynamics (Figure 4D) further indicating that mitochondria transport does not depend on GAPDH. We then investigated two other types of cargos: the amyloid-precursor protein APP fused to GFP (APP-GFP), a characteristic marker of FAT in neurons whose transport is kinesin-1-dependent (Kaether et al., 2000Kaether C. Skehel P. Dotti C.G. Axonal membrane proteins are transported in distinct carriers: a two-color video microscopy study in cultured hippocampal neurons.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and TrkB, the BDNF receptor fused to RFP (TrkB-RFP) that is trafficked bidirectionally within axons (Salinas et al., 2008Salinas S. Bilsland L.G. Schiavo G. Molecular landmarks along the axonal route: axonal transport in health and disease.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Whereas, APP and TrkB-containing vesicles motilities were not modified upon oligomycin treatment (Figure S3E), we observed a marked reduction in the transport of both cargos after GAPDH silencing (Figures 4E and 4F) suggesting that GAPDH could participate to the transport of many different types of vesicles. Because glycolysis may have a preferentially predominant role in providing ATP in cultured neurons, we determined the consequences of GAPDH depletion on in vivo axonal transport in Drosophila melanogaster. We exploited the transparency of the larvae to record axonal transport (Pilling et al., 2006Pilling A.D. Horiuchi D. Lively C.M. Saxton W.M. Kinesin-1 and Dynein are the primary motors for fast transport of mitochondria in Drosophila motor axons.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Larvae at L3 stage were placed between two coverslips and examined by videomicroscopy (Figures 4G and 4H). We used the UAS-GAL4 system to express synaptotagmin-GFP in the segmental nerves of Drosophila using the Ok6-Gal4 driver. We crossed these flies with UAS-shGAPDH flies to selectively deplete GAPDH in the motoneurons of the offspring. As control, we crossed the synaptotagmin-GFP flies to UAS-shZPG flies (see Extended Experimental Procedures). We observed a strong reduction in the velocity of synaptotagmin-GFP vesicles transport in flies expressing shGAPDH compared to that in flies expressing the shZPG (Figure 4I; Movie S3). The use of another UAS-shGAPDH Drosophila (shGAPDH(2)) line gave similar results (Figure 4I). We also found that the dynamics of mitochondria were not altered in flies that are silenced for GAPDH. (Figure 4J). This further demonstrates in vivo our findings that transport of vesicles depends on GAPDH whereas transport of mitochondria does not. Together, our results in cortical neurons and in Drosophila larvae demonstrate that (1) GAPDH is required for FAT in vitro and in vivo, (2) this mechanism might be general, and (3) this critical function has been evolutionarily conserved. Although GAPDH is mainly cytosolic, it has also been reported to be in specific subcellular compartments including the cytoskeleton, membranes, and fusion vesicles (Tristan et al., 2011Tristan C. Shahani N. Sedlak T.W. Sawa A. The diverse functions of GAPDH: views from different subcellular compartments.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Therefore we analyzed whether GAPDH is located on brain vesicles. We performed subcellular fractionation of mouse brain and found GAPDH in the “small vesicles” fraction (P3) that also contained synaptophysin, BDNF and the p50 and p150 subunits of dynactin. We also detected dynein intermediate chain (DIC) and kinesin heavy chain (KHC) that are subunits of the corresponding molecular motors, dynein and kinesin-1 (Figures 5A and S4). We next performed immunofluorescence experiments for endogenous GAPDH on neurons that were electroporated with BDNF-mCherry. We first permeabilized cells with saponin before fixation to remove the abundant cytosolic pool of GAPDH and selectively detect vesicle-associated GAPDH. We found a strong colocalization of endogenous GAPDH on BDNF-containing vesicles along axons as shown by confocal microscopy and reconstruction along the z axis. Quantification of the colocalization revealed a strong overlap between BDNF vesicles and GAPDH (Figure 5B) with 77.2% ± 7.6% of BDNF vesicles being positive for endogenous GAPDH (n = 102). To further demonstrate that GAPDH is present on “motile vesicles” and has a functional role, we adapted a previously reported protocol (Perlson et al., 2009Perlson E. Jeong G.B. Ross J.L. Dixit R. Wallace K.E. Kalb R.G. Holzbaur E.L. A switch in retrograde signaling from survival to stress in rapid-onset neurodegeneration.J.

https://openalex.org/W2158482911,"There are ~650,000 Alu elements in transcribed regions of the human genome. These elements contain cryptic splice sites, so they are in constant danger of aberrant incorporation into mature transcripts. Despite posing a major threat to transcriptome integrity, little is known about the molecular mechanisms preventing their inclusion. Here, we present a mechanism for protecting the human transcriptome from the aberrant exonization of transposable elements. Quantitative iCLIP data show that the RNA-binding protein hnRNP C competes with the splicing factor U2AF65 at many genuine and cryptic splice sites. Loss of hnRNP C leads to formation of previously suppressed Alu exons, which severely disrupt transcript function. Minigene experiments explain disease-associated mutations in Alu elements that hamper hnRNP C binding. Thus, by preventing U2AF65 binding to Alu elements, hnRNP C plays a critical role as a genome-wide sentinel protecting the transcriptome. The findings have important implications for human evolution and disease."

However, posttranslational regulation of RIG-I signaling remains to be fully understood.

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), are main sensors of the invading viruses (Kawai and Akira, 2010Kawai T. Akira S.

TLR3, 7, 8, and 9 detect viral RNAs and DNAs in the endosome, whereas RLR members RIG-I and MDA5 sense viral RNAs in the cytoplasm (Kato et al., 2011Kato H. Takahasi K. Fujita T. RIG-I-like receptors: cytoplasmic sensors for non-self RNA.Immunol. Rev. 2011; 243: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Upon recognizing invading viruses, PRRs activate downstream signaling pathways to initiate innate immune response through the induction of type I interferons (IFNs). TLRs-mediated signaling pathways recruit adaptor proteins such as MyD88 and TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF), leading to the activation of transcription factors that regulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs (Kawai and Akira, 2011Kawai T.

RIG-I and MDA5 both contain DExD/H box RNA helicase with two caspase-recruiting domain (CARD)-like sequences and a helicase domain (Yoneyama et al., 2004Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N.

Insufficient IFN production causes chronic infection, whereas excessive IFN causes autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. Thus, precise control of RIG-I signaling is critical for efficient viral clearance without harmful immunopathology. The different kinds of PRRs can cross-regulate their downstream signaling events in either a synergistic or antagonistic manner (Kawai and Akira, 2011Kawai T. Akira S. Toll-like receptors and their crosstalk with other innate receptors in infection and immunity.Immunity. 2011; 34: 637-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). Extensive interplays between PRRs and other pivotal immune mediators and receptors also orchestrate the outcome of host innate immune defenses. For example, the activation of RLR resulted in the selective suppression of transcription of the gene encoding the p40 subunit of interleukin 12 that was effectively induced by the activation of TLRs. Cross-interference of RLR and TLR signaling pathways modulates antibacterial T cell responses (Negishi et al., 2012Negishi H. Yanai H. Nakajima A. Koshiba R. Atarashi K. Matsuda A. Matsuki K. Miki S. Doi T. Aderem A. et al.Cross-interference of RLR and TLR signaling pathways modulates antibacterial T cell responses.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The distinct classes of PRRs overlap in the spectrum of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that they recognized and cross-integrate their downstream signal pathways; PRRs signaling is also cross-modulated by signaling generated via other membrane-associated receptors. For example, innate immunity utilizes members of the host lectin family (i.e., C-type lectin receptors, sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins [Siglecs], and galectins) as PRRs to detect viruses or transduce signals (van Kooyk and Rabinovich, 2008van Kooyk Y.

Roles of galectins in infection.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 424-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, the role of lectins in innate immune response and their crosstalk with the RIG-I pathway in antiviral innate response have not been established. Our systemic analyses identified several genes of lectin family that were upregulated significantly in macrophages in response to infection with RNA viruses. Among them, we focused on Siglec-G, as it was upregulated the most and the quickest upon RNA virus infection. Moreover, our experiments indicated that knocking down Siglecg with siRNA in macrophages increased the VSV-induced IFN-β mRNA expression most potently compared with knocking down other lectin genes. These preliminary results indicated the importance of Siglec-G in antiviral innate immunity. In addition, the mouse homolog of human Siglec-10 had been independently identified by us and others (Li et al., 2001Li N. Zhang W. Wan T. Zhang J. Chen T. Yu Y. Wang J. Cao X.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 6083-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the functional study of Siglec-G attracted our attention. Siglec-G belongs to the family of Siglecs, which has intracellular domains with ITIM (Pillai et al., 2012Pillai S. Netravali I.A. Cariappa A. Mattoo H. Siglecs and immune regulation.Annu. Rev.

Recent studies demonstrate that the CD24-Siglec-G/10 interaction is important for the negative regulation of host response to danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Chen et al., 2009Chen G.Y.

Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the biological functions of Siglec-G and its role in antiviral innate immunity remained elusive. Ubiquitination is one of the most versatile posttranslational modifications and is also indispensable for antiviral infection. Posttranslational modification of RIG-I and downstream signaling proteins by different types of ubiquitination has been found to be a key event in the regulation of RIG-I-triggered NF-κB and IRF3 activation (Loo and Gale, 2011Loo Y.M. Gale Jr., M. Immune signaling by RIG-I-like receptors.Immunity. 2011; 34: 680-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). K63-linked ubiquitination by TRIM25 (Gack et al., 2007Gack M.U. Shin Y.C. Joo C.H. Urano T. Liang C. Sun L. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Chen Z. Inoue S. Jung J.U.

On the other hand, RIG-I also undergoes ubiquitination by RNF125 for proteasomal degradation (Arimoto et al., 2007Arimoto K. Takahashi H. Hishiki T. Konishi H. Fujita T. Shimotohno K. Negative regulation of the RIG-I signaling by the ubiquitin ligase RNF125.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 7500-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, which and how ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin binding scaffold proteins contribute to regulation of RIG-I signaling remains to be illuminated. Here, we report that RNA virus infection upregulates Siglecg expression via the NF-κB pathway. Mice with targeted mutation of Siglecg are protected against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection with much more type I IFN production. Siglec-G associates with c-Cbl and RIG-I via SHP2, promoting RIG-I proteasomal degradation after conjugation to K48-linked ubiquitin by c-Cbl. Our data demonstrate a negative feedback regulation of RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune response through posttranslational modification of RIG-I. In order to identify molecules selectively involved in the regulation of innate response against RNA viral infection, we analyzed gene expression profiles in mouse peritoneal macrophages infected with the RNA virus VSV. Focusing on the expression of lectin family genes, we found that VSV infection significantly changed the mRNA level of several lectins, including C-type lectin receptors and Siglecs (Figure 1A). Upregulation of the expression of a panel of lectin family genes was further validated by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) in macrophages infected with various pathogens, including VSV, DNA virus (herpes simplex virus I [HSV-1]), intracellular bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes [LM]), or extracellular Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli [E. coli]). Among these genes, the mRNA level of Siglec-G was upregulated most significantly and quickly from 4 to 12 hr after infection with VSV, but not by infection with HSV-1, LM, or E. coli (Figure 1B). siRNA knockdown of Siglecg in macrophages increased the VSV-induced IFN-β mRNA expression most potently compared with knocking down other lectin genes (Figure S1A available online). Upregulation of Siglecg expression was VSV (MOI) dose dependent (Figure S1B). Further, Siglecg was upregulated in macrophages transfected with poly(I:C) or infected with another RNA virus, the Sendai virus (SeV), but remained unchanged in macrophages stimulated with various TLR ligands or transfected with LM genomic DNA, poly(dA:dT), or poly(dG:dC) (Figures 1C, S1C, and S1D). These data suggest that the infection of RNA viruses, but not DNA viruses or bacteria, specifically upregulates Siglecg expression in macrophages.Figure S1RNA Virus Infection Upregulates Siglecg Expression by Histone H3 Modification through the NF-κB Pathway, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Q-PCR analysis of IFN-β mRNA expression in macrophages transfected with control siRNA, Clec2j siRNA, Clec2l siRNA, Klre1 siRNA, Colec11 siRNA or Siglecg siRNA, 48 hr later, infected for indicated time with VSV.(B) Q-PCR analysis of Siglec-G mRNA expression in macrophages infected for indicated MOIs with VSV for 8 hr.(C and D) Q-PCR analysis of Siglec-G mRNA expression in peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS, CpG, R837 or transfected with various DNA by Jetpei.(E) Q-PCR analysis of Siglec-G mRNA expression in macrophages pretreated for 1 hr with SP600125 (10 μM), PD98059 (10 μM), SB203580 (10 μM), Wortmannin (100ng/ml) or Gö6976 (2.5 μM) before infected with VSV for indicated hours.(F) Q-PCR analysis of Siglec-G mRNA expression in Ifnβ−/−, Ifnα/βR−/− or Irf3−/− macrophages infected for indicated hours with VSV.(G) Luciferase assay analysis of Siglecg promoter activation.

We further assessed VSV infection-induced Siglecg expression in peritoneal macrophages derived from Rigi−/−, Irf3−/−, Ifnβ−/−, or IfnαβR−/− mice and wild-type (WT) mice-derived peritoneal macrophages pretreated with PDTC, a NF-κB inhibitor, PD98059 (MEK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), SB203580 (P38 inhibitor), Wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), or Gö 6976 (PKC inhibitor). VSV-infection-induced upregulation of Siglecg expression was attenuated in Rigi−/− macrophages or WT macrophages pretreated with PDTC (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1E). VSV-infection-induced upregulation of Siglecg expression was unaffected in Irf3−/−, Ifnβ−/−, or IfnαβR−/− mice-derived macrophages as compared to WT mice-derived macrophages (Figure S1F). Consistent with a role for NF-κB, Siglecg promoter-luc activity increased in HEK293T cells ectopically overexpressing the p65 subunit of NF-κB with or without RNA virus (SeV) infection (Figure S1G). The data suggest that RNA viral infection upregulates Siglecg expression via RIG-I-triggered NF-κB signaling. Histone modifications play important roles in the control of gene transcription. By ChIP assay, we found that H3K4me3 was upregulated and H3K27me3 was downregulated in the promoter of Siglecg gene in macrophages after VSV infection, whereas both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 remained constant throughout the stimulation with LPS (Figure 1F). It has been reported that histone methyltransferase MLL mediates methylation of H3K4 (Wang et al., 2009Wang P. Lin C. Smith E.R. Guo H. Sanderson B.W. Wu M. Gogol M. Alexander T. Seidel C. Wiedemann L.M. et al.Global analysis of H3K4 methylation defines MLL family member targets and points to a role for MLL1-mediated H3K4 methylation in the regulation of transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 6074-6085Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and another chromatin H3K4 methyltransferase, SET7/9, is an important coactivator of NF-κB (Li et al., 2008Li Y. Reddy M.A. Miao F. Shanmugam N. Yee J.K. Hawkins D. Ren B. Natarajan R. Role of the histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, SET7/9, in the regulation of NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory genes. Relevance to diabetes and inflammation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26771-26781Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments showed that VSV infection, but not LPS stimulation, could increase both SET7/9 and MLL enrichment at Siglecg promoter in macrophages (Figures 1G and 1H). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that RNA viral infection specifically upregulates Siglecg expression in macrophages via an NF-κB-dependent mechanism and may also involve epigenetic modification of histone H3. To investigate the role and functional significance of Siglec-G in host antiviral innate response, we challenged Siglecg−/− mice with RNA viruses VSV and SeV. VSV titer and replication in organs from Siglecg−/− mice were significantly reduced compared to Siglecg+/+ mice (Figures 2A and 2B ). Siglecg−/− mice were also more resistant to VSV infection in overall survival assays (Figure 2C). Less infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in the lungs of Siglecg−/− mice after infection with VSV (Figure 2D) or SeV (Figure S2A). Immunohistochemical staining for the macrophage glycoprotein F4/80 and neutrophil’s azurophilic granules myeloperoxidase (MPO) demonstrated that less macrophages and neutrophils infiltrated in the lung from Siglecg−/− mice than from Siglecg+/+ mice infected with VSV (Figure S2B). Similar infiltration of inflammatory cells was detected in the lungs from Siglecg−/− and Siglecg+/+ mice infected with DNA virus HSV-1 (Figure S2A). Consistent with increased resistance, Siglecg−/− mice produced higher levels of IFN-β than Siglecg+/+ mice in response to infection with VSV (Figure 2E) or SeV (Figure S2C). In contrast, TNF-α and IL-6 production was unaffected by Siglecg deletion. We also noted higher IFN-β mRNA expression in the organs and peritoneal macrophages of Siglecg−/− mice than in those of Siglecg+/+ mice infected with VSV (Figures 2F and 2G) or SeV (Figures S2D and S2E). Upregulation of IFN-β is also specific to RNA virus infection, as no significant difference in IFN-β production or mRNA expression was observed in mice infected with HSV-1 (Figures S2C–S2E). To further characterize the dynamics of chronic VSV infection, we measured VSV loads in lung homogenate supernatants and observed the pathological changes of lung from Siglecg−/− and Siglecg+/+ mice infected with lower-dose VSV. As detected by TCID50 assay, VSV loads in organ samples from Siglecg−/− mice were significantly lower than in organs from Siglecg+/+ mice on days 1 and 3, and VSV loads declined below the limitation of detection on day 5 and remained undetectable through day 14 postinfection (Figure S2F). Inflammatory changes observed in lungs were consistent with viral loads (Figure S2G). These data demonstrate that Siglecg−/− mice develop more potent innate response against RNA viral infection by producing more IFN-β.Figure S2Siglecg-Deficient Mice Are More Resistant to RNA Virus Infection by Producing More IFN-β, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) HE staining of lung sections from Siglecg+/+ and Siglecg–/– mice in response to SeV or HSV-1.

Upon infection with VSV or SeV, but not HSV-1, Siglecg−/− macrophages produced more IFN-β, TNF-α, and IL-6 protein and expressed higher IFN-β and IFN-α4 mRNA than Siglecg+/+ macrophages (Figures 3A, 3B and S3A). The same phenomenon was also observed in bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) (Figures S3B and S3C). As to the response to TLR ligands, Siglecg−/− macrophages produced IFN-β more obviously than Siglecg+/+ macrophages in response to intracellular transfection of poly(I:C) (Figure S3D). By contrast, no difference in IFN-β secretion was observed between Siglecg−/− and Siglecg+/+ macrophages stimulated with LPS, R837, poly(I:C), and LM or transfected with poly(dA:dT) or poly(dG:dC) (Figure S3E). We further confirmed that siRNA knockdown of Siglecg significantly increased the production of IFN-β and mRNA expression of IFN-β and IFN-α4 in macrophages infected with VSV or SeV (Figures 3C–3E). Furthermore, RAW264.7 macrophages with Flag-tagged Siglec-G stably overexpressed produced less IFN-β and expressed lower IFN-β and IFN-α4 mRNA in response to infection with VSV or SeV, but not HSV-1(Figures 3F–3H). Correspondingly, virus replication was more significantly inhibited in Siglecg−/− macrophages infected with VSV (Figure 3I), and enhanced viral replication was observed in Siglec-G-overexpressing RAW264.7 macrophages infected with VSV (Figure 3J). These data suggest that Siglec-G selectively suppresses production of type I interferon and inhibits antiviral innate response against RNA viral infection.Figure S3Siglec-G Selectively Inhibits RNA-Virus-Induced Production of Type I Interferon in Macrophages and DCs, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) ELISA of TNF-α and IL-6 in supernatants of Siglecg+/+ and Siglecg–/– peritoneal macrophages infected for 24 hr with VSV, SeV or HSV-1.(B) Q-PCR analysis of IFN-β and IFN-α4 mRNA expression in Siglecg+/+ and Siglecg–/– BMDCs infected for 8 hr with VSV, SeV or HSV-1.(C) ELISA of cytokines in supernatants of Siglecg+/+ and Siglecg–/– BMDCs infected for 24 hr with VSV, SeV or HSV-1.(D) ELISA of IFN-β in supernatants of Siglecg+/+ and Siglecg–/– macrophages transfected with poly(I:C) by Interferin for 12 h.(E) ELISA of IFN-β in supernatants of Siglecg+/+ and Siglecg–/– macrophages transfected with poly(dG:dC), poly(dA:dT) by Jetpei for 12h or stimulated with LPS, polyI:C, LM, R837 for 12h.Data are means ± SEM. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) ELISA of TNF-α and IL-6 in supernatants of Siglecg+/+ and Siglecg–/– peritoneal macrophages infected for 24 hr with VSV, SeV or HSV-1.

https://openalex.org/W2162613917,"Melanocortin 4 receptors (MC4Rs) in the central nervous system are key regulators of energy and glucose homeostasis. Notably, obese patients with MC4R mutations are hyperinsulinemic and resistant to obesity-induced hypertension. Although these effects are probably dependent upon the activity of the autonomic nervous system, the cellular effects of MC4Rs on parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons remain undefined. Here, we show that MC4R agonists inhibit parasympathetic preganglionic neurons in the brainstem. In contrast, MC4R agonists activate sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. Deletion of MC4Rs in cholinergic neurons resulted in elevated levels of insulin. Furthermore, re-expression of MC4Rs specifically in cholinergic neurons (including sympathetic preganglionic neurons) restores obesity-associated hypertension in MC4R null mice. These findings provide a cellular correlate of the autonomic side effects associated with MC4R agonists and demonstrate a role for MC4Rs expressed in cholinergic neurons in the regulation of insulin levels and in the development of obesity-induced hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2084825118,"Recent advances in the understanding of the genetics of type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility have focused attention on the regulation of transcriptional activity within the pancreatic beta-cell. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an important component of regulatory control, and have proven roles in the development of human disease and control of glucose homeostasis. We set out to establish the miRNA profile of human pancreatic islets and of enriched beta-cell populations, and to explore their potential involvement in T2D susceptibility. We used Illumina small RNA sequencing to profile the miRNA fraction in three preparations each of primary human islets and of enriched beta-cells generated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. In total, 366 miRNAs were found to be expressed (i.e. >100 cumulative reads) in islets and 346 in beta-cells; of the total of 384 unique miRNAs, 328 were shared. A comparison of the islet-cell miRNA profile with those of 15 other human tissues identified 40 miRNAs predominantly expressed (i.e. >50% of all reads seen across the tissues) in islets. Several highly-expressed islet miRNAs, such as miR-375, have established roles in the regulation of islet function, but others (e.g. miR-27b-3p, miR-192-5p) have not previously been described in the context of islet biology. As a first step towards exploring the role of islet-expressed miRNAs and their predicted mRNA targets in T2D pathogenesis, we looked at published T2D association signals across these sites. We found evidence that predicted mRNA targets of islet-expressed miRNAs were globally enriched for signals of T2D association (p-values <0.01, q-values <0.1). At six loci with genome-wide evidence for T2D association (AP3S2, KCNK16, NOTCH2, SCL30A8, VPS26A, and WFS1) predicted mRNA target sites for islet-expressed miRNAs overlapped potentially causal variants. In conclusion, we have described the miRNA profile of human islets and beta-cells and provide evidence linking islet miRNAs to T2D pathogenesis."

In cardiovascular tissues, ROS are normally produced in response to RTK and GPC receptor signaling, as well as during mechanical (shear) stress.

An antioxidant network is required to balance these ROS and prevent oxidative damage, which may contribute to cardiovascular pathologies (Finkel, 2003Finkel T.

Although several enzymes responsible for ROS production in ECs have been identified, many of the molecules involved in the endogenous antioxidant network are unknown. A molecule known to play an important antioxidant role in the cardiovascular system is CoQ10 (also known as Coenzyme Q10 or ubiquinone) (Pepe et al., 2007Pepe S. Marasco S.F. Haas S.J. Sheeran F.L.

Role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in cardiac disease, hypertension and Meniere-like syndrome.Pharmacol. Ther. 2009; 124: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). CoQ10 is the only endogenously synthesized lipid-soluble antioxidant (Crane, 2007Crane F.L. Discovery of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) and an overview of function.Mitochondrion. 2007; 7: S2-S7Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar; Bentinger et al., 2007Bentinger M. Brismar K. Dallner G. The antioxidant role of coenzyme Q.Mitochondrion. 2007; 7: S41-S50Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). It is available in the membranes of the Golgi, where it is present at an even higher concentration than in the mitochondria, as well as in plasma membranes (Kalen et al., 1987Kalen A. Appelkvist E.L. Dallner G. Biosynthesis of ubiquinone in rat liver.Acta Chem. Scand. A. 1987; 41: 70-72Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar; Crane, 2001Crane F.L. Biochemical functions of coenzyme Q10.J. Am. Coll.

Stimulation of coenzyme Q synthesis.Biofactors. 2008; 32: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although the biosynthesis of CoQ10 in mitochondria has been studied in detail, only a limited amount of data is available in regards to the synthesis of cellular membrane CoQ10. Several in vivo experiments suggest that CoQ10 synthesis may also occur in the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum membranes, providing the cellular membrane CoQ10 pool (Kalén et al., 1990Kalén A. Appelkvist E.L. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. Nonaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate transferase, an enzyme involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis, in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi system of rat liver.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1158-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, although hypothesized, a “nonmitochondrial” CoQ10 biosynthetic enzyme has not been identified (Bentinger et al., 2010Bentinger M. Tekle M. Dallner G. Coenzyme Q—biosynthesis and functions.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 396: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Identification of such an enzyme could be extremely useful in order to devise strategies to counteract the excess of ROS responsible for cellular oxidative damage (such as lipid peroxidation, protein nitrosylation, and DNA oxidation) and therefore balance redox signaling especially in cardiovascular tissues. CoQ10 is a mobile lipophilic electron carrier that is critical for electron transfer both in the mitochondrial membrane for respiratory chain activity as well as in Golgi and plasma membranes for NAD(P)H-oxidoreductase-dependent reactions such as in NO synthesis (Navas et al., 2007Navas P. Villalba J.M. de Cabo R. The importance of plasma membrane coenzyme Q in aging and stress responses.Mitochondrion. 2007; 7: S34-S40Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a critical regulator of cardiovascular functions by generating nitric oxide (NO), which is an important mediator of cardiovascular homeostasis (Alp and Channon, 2004Alp N.J. Channon K.M. Regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase by tetrahydrobiopterin in vascular disease.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar; Förstermann and Sessa, 2012Förstermann U. Sessa W.C. Nitric oxide synthases: regulation and function.Eur. Heart J. 2012; 33 (837a–837d): 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). As in the case with nonmitochondrial CoQ10, eNOS is specifically localized in the Golgi and plasma membrane of heart and endothelial cells, and it can be differentially regulated in these two cellular compartments (Fulton et al., 2002Fulton D. Fontana J. Sowa G. Gratton J.P. Lin M. Li K.X. Michell B. Kemp B.E. Rodman D. Sessa W.C. Localization of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase phosphorylated on serine 1179 and nitric oxide in Golgi and plasma membrane defines the existence of two pools of active enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4277-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Different reports have suggested that CoQ10 may improve endothelial dysfunction by “recoupling” eNOS and modulating NO-related signaling (Chew and Watts, 2004Chew G.T. Watts G.F. Coenzyme Q10 and diabetic endotheliopathy: oxidative stress and the ‘recoupling hypothesis’.QJM. 2004; 97: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar; Tsai et al., 2012Tsai K.L. Huang Y.H.

Biochem. 2012; 23: 458-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here, we identify UBIAD1 as an enzyme for CoQ10 synthesis at the level of Golgi membranes and show that it is critical for oxidative stress protection. In particular, UBIAD1 protects cardiovascular tissues from eNOS-dependent oxidative stress. We propose a functional link between UBIAD1, CoQ10, and NO signaling during cardiovascular development and homeostasis. By forward genetic screens for cardiovascular mutants (2005 Tuebingen screen; Jin et al., 2007Jin S.W. Herzog W. Santoro M.M. Mitchell T.S. Frantsve J. Jungblut B. Beis D. Scott I.C. D’Amico L.A. Ober E.A. et al.A transgene-assisted genetic screen identifies essential regulators of vascular development in vertebrate embryos.Dev. Biol. 2007; 307: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we identified mutations in the barolo (bar) gene (bart31131 and bars847). These mutations are recessive and show complete penetrance and expressivity. bar mutants show distinct cranial vascular hemorrhages and pericardial edema in the context of wild-type body morphology (Figure 1A). To examine whether this phenotype is associated with cardiovascular defects, we crossed the mutations into Tg(kdrl:GFP)s843 (Figure 1B). The hemorrhagic phenotype in bar mutants is accompanied by endothelial regression and fragmentation in the cranial and trunk vascular compartments (Figures 1C and 1D). Time-lapse analyses of trunk vasculature indicate that the bar phenotype starts around 36 hr postfertilization (hpf) (Movies S1, S2, S3, and S4) and that it is not due to general loss of blood flow. The cardiac edema of bar mutants is caused by a gradual breakdown of endocardial and myocardial cells in the heart, leading to the collapse of the heart between 60 and 72 hpf (data not shown). All these features lead to the complete cardiac and vascular organ failure by 72 hpf in bar mutant embryos. Cardiovascular failure is related to altered redox signaling and an increased production of ROS (Hare and Stamler, 2005Hare J.M. Stamler J.S. NO/redox disequilibrium in the failing heart and cardiovascular system.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). bar mutants compared to wild-type siblings show altered redox balance and oxidative stress features evaluated as an increase of the NADP/NADPH ratio and as an overexpression of antioxidant genes, respectively (Figures 1E and 1F). Increase of ROS production occurs specifically in cardiovascular tissues as demonstrated by measuring oxidizing species in ECs of bar mutants using the selective and stable ROS detector CellROX (Figure 1G). We also measured S-nitrosylation levels on heart and blood vessel sections of bar mutants. bar mutants show higher levels of S-nitrosylated proteins in heart and blood vessel cells as well as in pronephros as measured by an antibody against S-nitroso-cysteine (SNO-Cys) (Figure 1H). A high level of S-nitrosylated proteins is normally associated with altered redox signaling and cellular protection against oxidative stress (Stamler et al., 2001Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Nitrosylation. the prototypic redox-based signaling mechanism.Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar; Hess et al., 2005Hess D.T. Matsumoto A.

Murphy E. Protein S-nitrosylation and cardioprotection.Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We found that cardiovascular tissues from bar mutants are positive for 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a free radical-induced oxidative lesion in DNA (Figure 1I). Analyses of heart and blood vessel sections show that both myocardial and endothelial tissues of bar mutants exhibit ROS-mediated DNA damage compared to controls. Indeed, endothelial and endocardial cells in bar mutants were positive for TUNEL staining and show typical morphological features of apoptotic cells at this stage (Figure 1L). In summary, both mutant embryos carrying the barolo mutation show increased oxidative stress, DNA damage, and cell death specifically in blood vessels and the heart. We determined that bar encodes Ubiad1 (UbiA-domain containing protein 1) (Figure 1M). Sequence analyses show that the bart31131 mutant allele contains a nonsense mutation (123 T > A) in ubiad1 introducing a premature stop codon at amino acid position 41, likely generating a null allele. The second allele of bar (bars847) bears a base change (185 T > A) leading to the substitution of a conserved leucine residue to glutamine at amino acid position 62 (Ubiad1L62Q) (Figure 1N). bars847 shows the same phenotypical features as bart31131 except the phenotype is delayed by 12 hr (Figures S1A–S1E and S1T available online). Both bar allele mutants do not express Ubiad1 (Figure 1O) and are fully rescued by Ubiad1 mRNA expression. Ubiad1L62Q mRNA does not rescue the bart31131 mutant indicating that this amino acid mutation is sufficient to knock out Ubiad1 activity (Figure 1P). To confirm that Ubiad1 regulates cardiovascular protection and survival, we knocked down Ubiad1 expression using an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide. Ubiad1 morphants show the same hemorrhagic phenotype and cardiovascular defects as bar mutants (Figures S1F–S1I). Analyses of ubiad1 mRNA expression in developing zebrafish embryos reveal a ubiquitous expression at 24 hpf in addition to a distinct expression in the heart at 48 hpf (Figures S1J–S1L), in agreement with mammalian expression data (Nakagawa et al., 2010Nakagawa K. Hirota Y. Sawada N. Yuge N. Watanabe M. Uchino Y. Okuda N. Shimomura Y. Suhara Y. Okano T. Identification of UBIAD1 as a novel human menaquinone-4 biosynthetic enzyme.Nature. 2010; 468: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition, cell transplantation and tissue-specific rescue experiments showed that Ubiad1 functions autonomously within endothelial and endocardial cells (Figures S1M–S1P and Table S1). These data indicate that loss of ubiad1 triggers a progressive cardiovascular failure by increasing oxidative stress and apoptosis in heart and blood vessels suggesting a role for Ubiad1 as a controller of redox state and ROS levels in vertebrate cardiovascular tissues (Figure S1Q). Thereby, bar represents a unique model to study oxidative stress conditions and redox signaling during zebrafish development. Ubiad1 is conserved among species and contains an UbiA prenyltransferase domain, present also in the vertebrate protein Coq2. So far, the mitochondrial enzyme Coq2 is the only vertebrate enzyme known to synthesize CoQ10 through the prenylation of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid by oligoprenyl diphosphates (Forsgren et al., 2004Forsgren M. Attersand A. Lake S. Grünler J. Swiezewska E. Dallner G. Climent I. Isolation and functional expression of human COQ2, a gene encoding a polyprenyl transferase involved in the synthesis of CoQ.Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The CoQ10 molecule is composed of a redox active benzoquinone ring, which is connected to a polyisoprenoid side chain of variable length (typically 9/10 units in vertebrates) (Crane, 2001Crane F.L. Biochemical functions of coenzyme Q10.J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2001; 20: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). As with Coq2, we speculate that Ubiad1 might catalyze the biosynthesis of CoQ10. We measured CoQ10 levels in bar mutants and ubiad1 morphants by HPLC-MS (Figures 2A and 2B ). The absence of Ubiad1 in zebrafish larvae significantly reduces CoQ10 levels (Figure 2C), whereas cholesterol levels are not significantly affected (Figure S2A). By the time course of synthesis analyses, we found that CoQ10 increases during zebrafish embryonic development and is almost entirely produced by the zygote without any contribution from the yolk sac (Figure S2B). On the other hand, a significant amount of embryonic cholesterol is provided by the yolk sac throughout early development (Figure S2C). These data suggest that de novo zygotic synthesis of CoQ10 by Ubiad1 (and/or Coq2) is required for zebrafish development.Figure S2UBIAD1 Regulates CoQ10 but Not Cholesterol or Vitamin K2 Levels in Zebrafish Embryos and Human Endothelial Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Histograms show levels of cholesterol detected by HPLC-UV analysis in bart31131 and respective siblings (sib) or ubiad1 morphants and relative controls (ctrl MO).

CoQ10 is detected as m/z 885.6804 [molecule-Na+] and CoQ10-13C6 is detected as m/z 891.7011 [molecule-Na+], respectively. Endothelial cells metabolize 4-hydroxy-benzoic acid-13C6 into CoQ10-13C6. To test whether it is the absence of CoQ10 synthesis in zebrafish embryos that causes the bar phenotype, we injected CoQ10 in single-cell stage bar mutants (Figure 2D). Three different CoQ10 formulations rescue bar mutants, suggesting that the intake of CoQ10 in Ubiad1 deficient embryos may restore normal cardiovascular development. A recent paper reports that UBIAD1 is required for Vitamin K2 production (Nakagawa et al., 2010Nakagawa K. Hirota Y. Sawada N. Yuge N. Watanabe M. Uchino Y. Okuda N. Shimomura Y. Suhara Y. Okano T. Identification of UBIAD1 as a novel human menaquinone-4 biosynthetic enzyme.Nature. 2010; 468: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); however, our data indicate that a lack of Vitamin K2 is not responsible for the cardiovascular phenotype in bar mutants (Figures 2D and S2D–S2K). To provide biochemical evidence that Ubiad1 is able to synthesize CoQ10, we performed metabolic studies in zebrafish embryos by analyzing the ability of bar mutants to convert hydroxy-4-benzoic acid to CoQ10 (Figure 2E). We confirmed that administration of 13C6-labeled hydroxy-4-benzoic acid (hydroxy-4-benzoic acid-13C6) is metabolized to CoQ10-13C6 in zebrafish embryos by injecting this C13-labeled precursor in zebrafish embryos at one-cell stage. After 72 hpf of incubation, lipids were extracted and analyzed by HPLC-MS to quantify the amount of CoQ10-13C6 formed (Figure 2E). bar mutants show a reduced CoQ10-13C6 production compared to wild-type siblings. CoQ9-13C6 production was also impaired (Figure 2F), indicating that zebrafish larvae can synthesize both CoQ9 and CoQ10 as can human cells (Turunen et al., 2004Turunen M. Olsson J. Dallner G. Metabolism and function of coenzyme Q.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1660: 171-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ubiad1 is a 4-OH-benzoic acid-prenyl-tranferase enzyme required for CoQ10 and CoQ9 biosynthesis in vivo. Ubiad1 and HMG-CoA Reductase inhibitors act in the Mevalonate Pathway for CoQ10-Dependent Cardiovascular Oxidative Stress Protection. The rate-limiting reaction in the biosynthesis of CoQ10 is the transfer of the polyprenyl-pyrophosphate (polyprenyl-PP) chain, derived from mevalonate, on to 4-OH-benzoic acid, derived from tyrosine metabolism (Bentinger et al., 2008Bentinger M. Tekle M. Brismar K. Chojnacki T. Swiezewska E. Dallner G. Stimulation of coenzyme Q synthesis.Biofactors. 2008; 32: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). We reduced the pool of polyprenyl-PP available for CoQ10 synthesis by treating zebrafish embryos with statins, inhibitors of its precursor (e.g., mevalonate) (Figure S3A). By blocking HMG-CoA reductase, statins impair the mevalonate and FPP synthesis, which is mandatory to synthetize the polyprenyl-PP chain (Figure 2A). Wild-type embryos (ubiad1+/+) treated with statin developed a bar-like phenotype (Figures 3A–3C). Statin treatments efficiently reduced CoQ10 synthesis without interfering with cholesterol levels, probably because statin treatment blocks de novo cholesterol biosynthesis but does not interfere with the maternally provided cholesterol (Figures 3D and 3E). Zebrafish embryos treated with the squalene synthase inhibitor (SQI) or with farnesyl or geranyl-geranyl tranferase inhibitors (FTI or GGTI) did not exhibit a bar-like phenotype (Figure S3B), indicating that the absence of CoQ10 is the cause of the statin-induced cardiovascular oxidative phenotype. Furthermore, while treatment with a low-dose of statin did not produce any phenotype in wild-type (ubiad1+/+) embryos, it caused a bar-like phenotype in embryos heterozygous for ubiad1 (ubiad1+/−) (Figures 3F–3I). The statin-dependent phenotype in embryos was efficiently rescued by exogenous administration of liposomal CoQ10 (Figures 3J and 3K and S3C). To address the role of the mevalonate pathway in protection from oxidative stress in vivo, we measured ROS levels in zebrafish embryos treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. A ROS level increase is detected in statin-treated zebrafish embryos, and this oxidative stress was fully rescued by CoQ10 treatment (Figure 3L). These data suggest that HMG-CoA reductase and Ubiad"

We show that PKCζ deficiency promotes the plasticity necessary for cancer cells to reprogram their metabolism to utilize glutamine through the serine biosynthetic pathway in the absence of glucose. PKCζ represses the expression of two key enzymes of the pathway, PHGDH and PSAT1, and phosphorylates PHGDH at key residues to inhibit its enzymatic activity. Interestingly, the loss of PKCζ in mice results in enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis and increased levels of these two metabolic enzymes, whereas patients with low levels of PKCζ have a poor prognosis. Furthermore, PKCζ and caspase-3 activities are correlated with PHGDH levels in human intestinal tumors. Taken together, this demonstrates that PKCζ is a critical metabolic tumor suppressor in mouse and human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2051656825,"ISWI-family enzymes remodel chromatin by sliding nucleosomes along DNA, but the nucleosome translocation mechanism remains unclear. Here we use single-molecule FRET to probe nucleosome translocation by ISWI-family remodelers. Distinct ISWI-family members translocate nucleosomes with a similar stepping pattern maintained by the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. Nucleosome remodeling begins with a 7 bp step of DNA translocation followed by 3 bp subsequent steps toward the exit side of nucleosomes. These multi-bp, compound steps are comprised of 1 bp substeps. DNA movement on the entry side of the nucleosome occurs only after 7 bp of exit-side translocation, and each entry-side step draws in a 3 bp equivalent of DNA that allows three additional base pairs to be moved to the exit side. Our results suggest a remodeling mechanism with well-defined coordination at different nucleosomal sites featuring DNA translocation toward the exit side in 1 bp steps preceding multi-bp steps of DNA movement on the entry side."

All stages of the transcription cycle, from initiation to elongation to termination, are subject to regulation. During elongation, RNA extension by the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) is not a smooth, continuous process; instead, RNAP is prone to sequence-dependent pausing, where RNAP molecules delay extension of the RNA transcript. Transcriptional pausing is not simply the cause of inefficient elongation but plays key regulatory roles in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Core and Lis, 2008Core L.J. Lis J.T.

Pause mechanisms have been studied in greatest detail for bacterial RNAP. The current view of transcriptional pausing is that a common, unproductive elemental conformational intermediate of the RNAP active site underlies all transcriptional pauses (Herbert et al., 2006Herbert K.M.

The elemental pause state is off-pathway from the normal elongation cycle; the efficiency of RNAP entering the elemental pause state at pause-prone sites along DNA is less than 100% and is encoded in the underlying nucleic acid sequence of the RNA/DNA hybrid and the duplex DNA just downstream, nucleic acid elements that are enclosed within, and in close contact with, the RNAP (Figure 1; Vassylyev et al., 2007aVassylyev D.G.

Structural basis for transcription elongation by bacterial RNA polymerase.Nature. 2007; 448: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Genetic, biochemical, and single-molecule studies have established that the pause signal is multipartite. Once the elemental pause state is entered, the pause duration can be increased by subsequent events, such as backtracking or folding of a hairpin in the nascent RNA (Figure 1; Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Pausing by bacterial RNA polymerase is mediated by mechanistically distinct classes of signals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of backtracked states of eukaryotic RNAP II provide a framework for a mechanistic understanding of backtrack pauses (Cheung and Cramer, 2011Cheung A.C.M. Cramer P.

On the other hand, the elemental pause state, as well as its stabilization by the nascent RNA hairpin, is poorly understood, due in part to the absence of structural information. Here, we report crystal structures of bacterial RNAP paused elongation complexes (PECs). The structures define the RNAP conformation corresponding to the elemental pause state (ePECs), explain how this conformation inhibits the RNAP active site, and provide a framework for understanding how RNA hairpin formation extends the pause. Crystallographic studies of RNAP elongation states have been greatly facilitated by the use of nucleic acid scaffolds, which allow the formation of homogeneous complexes from short, preannealed synthetic DNA and RNA oligonucleotides (Daube and von Hippel, 1992Daube S.S. von Hippel P.H.

The biochemical and kinetic behavior of Escherichia coli (Eco) RNAP PECs assembled from nucleic acid scaffolds derived from the Eco his pause (Figure 2A) recapitulate the features of normal PECs, including the enhancement of pausing by NusA (Kyzer et al., 2007Kyzer S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 19020-19028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To further facilitate structural studies, we tested whether scaffolds could similarly recapitulate pausing with Thermus thermophilus (Tth) or Thermus aquaticus (Taq) RNAPs, the source for all high-resolution bacterial RNAP structures to date (Murakami et al., 2002Murakami K.S.

Transcription kinetics of Tth RNAP elongating through the expected target pause site of minimal Eco his pause nucleic acid scaffolds (Figure 2A; Table S1 available online) were compared with a nonpausing scaffold that was used to generate the structure of a canonical Tth RNAP elongation complex (EC; Figure 2B; Vassylyev et al., 2007aVassylyev D.G. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Tahirov T.H. Artsimovitch I.

Zhang J. Palangat M. Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Structural basis for substrate loading in bacterial RNA polymerase.Nature. 2007; 448: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In these assays, Tth RNAP transcription complexes were generated using DNA scaffolds (Figure 2; orange and blue) annealed to 14-nt RNAs (black) with 3′-ends two nucleotides upstream of the target site (target site at position 16 of the RNA). The complexes were provided with [α-32P]-CTP, generating 3′-labeled C15 RNAs (Figure 2). Addition of the next two NTPs allowed formation of complexes at the target 16-mer position (U16 for PECs, G16 for ECs), extension of the 16-mer RNAs, and, for the ePEC scaffold, isomerization into the ePEC state (Figure 2; Figure S1A). Although the occurrence of pausing also at the C15 position complicated kinetic analysis on the ePEC scaffold (see Extended Experimental Procedures), kinetic simulations required inclusion of an off-line pause state to account for the observed behavior of U16 complexes on the ePEC scaffold but not the behavior of G16 complexes on the EC scaffold (Figure 2). When a hairpin was added to the ePEC scaffold (Table S1), Tth RNAP exhibited an increase in dwell time of the paused species, similar to the behavior of Eco RNAP (data not shown; Kyzer et al., 2007Kyzer S. Ha K.S. Landick R. Palangat M. Direct versus limited-step reconstitution reveals key features of an RNA hairpin-stabilized paused transcription complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19020-19028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tth and Taq RNAP PECs also responded as expected to Tth and Taq NusA, respectively (Figure S1B; data not shown for Taq RNAP), an elongation factor universally conserved among bacteria and archaea (Ingham et al., 1999Ingham C.J. Dennis J. Furneaux P.A. Autogenous regulation of transcription termination factor Rho and the requirement for Nus factors in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that increases the duration of the his pause by Eco RNAP and that requires interaction with the pause hairpin for full effect (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000Artsimovitch I.

USA. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar; Toulokhonov et al., 2001Toulokhonov I. Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Allosteric control of RNA polymerase by a site that contacts nascent RNA hairpins.Science. 2001; 292: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These pause behaviors by Tth RNAP could also be demonstrated in standard transcription elongation assays after initiation at a promoter on linear duplex DNA templates containing the relevant ePEC, PEC-hairpin, or EC sequences within the transcription unit (Figures S1C–S1E). We conclude that Thermus RNAPs respond to the Eco his pause signal, forming the elemental pause state as well as the NusA-sensitive RNA hairpin-stabilized pause state, when assembled on the ePEC or PEC-hairpin scaffolds, respectively, validating the use of Tth or Taq RNAPs to investigate the ePEC structure. Based on these results, complexes with Tth and Taq core RNAPs were assembled on minimal ePEC and PEC-hairpin scaffolds for crystallization trials (Table S1). Three new crystal forms were obtained. With Taq RNAP PECs, a crystal form yielding diffraction data that extended to ∼7.8 Å resolution was obtained (Table S2). Analysis of the diffraction data indicated the presence of partial hemihedral twinning (Table S2). With Tth RNAP PECs assembled on three different scaffold designs, two novel crystal forms yielding diffraction data extending to 3.6 and 4.5 Å resolution were obtained (Table S3). We were unable to identify crystallization conditions compatible with the presence of the RNA pause hairpin in the nascent transcript. Although complexes assembled with PEC-hairpin scaffolds yielded crystals, subsequent analyses established that trace amounts of RNase present in the RNAP samples degraded the upstream RNA hairpin, allowing crystal growth. Crystallization trials with RNase-free RNAP samples assembled on PEC-hairpin and ePEC scaffolds confirmed that only ePEC scaffolds supported growth of the identified crystal forms (see Extended Experimental Procedures). For each of the three crystal forms, clear molecular replacement solutions were obtained using a search model based on the Taq RNAP core (Taq crystal form) or Tth EC structure with the nucleic acids removed (Tth crystal forms; Figure 3A; Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID codes 1HQM and 2O5I, respectively; Vassylyev et al., 2007aVassylyev D.G.

In all three cases, unbiased Fourier difference analyses (1) confirmed the presence of the RNA/DNA hybrid (Figure 3B; Figure S2A) and the downstream duplex DNA (poorly ordered due to high mobility; Figure S2B), indicating bound scaffold, and (2) indicated substantial conformational changes in the RNAP (Figures 3C and S2C). After rigid body refinement (Taq and Tth crystal forms), deformable elastic network (DEN)-assisted refinement as implemented in CNS (Schröder et al., 2010Schröder G.F. Levitt M. Brunger A.T.

Because of the low resolution and twinning problems of the Taq crystal form, we focused most of our structural analysis on the Tth ePEC crystal forms. Because the structures from the two Tth crystal forms were nearly identical, cross-crystal averaging, as implemented in Phenix (Adams et al., 2010Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B.

The overall shape of RNAP resembles a crab claw, with one pincer formed primarily by the β subunit and the other primarily by β′ (Figure 3A). Between the two pincers, the active site channel accommodates the nucleic acids in the EC (Korzheva et al., 2000Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Malhotra A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A.

The clamp (Figure 3C), a mobile structural module that makes up much of the β′ pincer, can undergo a swinging motion that opens the channel or closes around the DNA and RNA/DNA hybrid to stabilize the nucleic acid-bound state, leading to the high processivity of the enzyme (Gnatt et al., 2001Gnatt A.L.

All three RNAP structures exhibited an open-clamp conformation that was distinct from the closed-clamp conformation of the canonical ECs (Vassylyev et al., 2007aVassylyev D.G. Vassylyeva M.N.

Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A.

Sekine S. Kumarevel T. Hino N. Murayama Y. Kamegamori S. Yamamoto M. Sakamoto K. Yokoyama S. Crystal structure of bacterial RNA polymerase bound with a transcription inhibitor protein.Nature. 2010; 468: 978-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The root-mean-square deviations (rmsd) for equivalent protein backbone atoms of the clamp module for various bacterial RNAP structures aligned with the ePEC structures based on the core module (Figure 3C) highlight the similarities with Taq core RNAP and the Gfh1-bound ECs on the one hand and the differences with the canonical ECs on the other (Figures 3C and S2D; Table S4). Although the rmsd for equivalent backbone atoms of the core module are ∼1 Å for all of the structures, the differences for the clamp range from 3–4 Å for the core RNAP and Gfh1-ECs (reflecting small differences in the degrees of clamp opening) but 12–15 Å for the canonical ECs. In all cases, the fold of the clamp module itself is not altered (rmsd <1.7 Å; Table S4). The open-clamp conformation is unlikely due to crystal packing artifacts because most crystal contacts to the β′ pincer (comprised of clamp and β′ nonconserved domain) are made via the nonconserved domain, which is flexible and has in fact a different orientation in the two Tth crystal forms. More importantly, the packing interactions around the clamp are different for each crystal form (Figure S2E). The similarity of the ePEC structure with the structure of Taq core RNAP (Zhang et al., 1999Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus core RNA polymerase at 3.3 A resolution.Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) indicates that this open-clamp conformation is accessible to the free core RNAP and that it may, in fact, represent the most stable conformation of the free core RNAP (see the Discussion). The similar open-clamp structure in Gfh1-bound ECs is likely caused by Ghf1-binding (Tagami et al., 2010Tagami S. Sekine S. Kumarevel T. Hino N. Murayama Y. Kamegamori S. Yamamoto M. Sakamoto K. Yokoyama S. Crystal structure of bacterial RNA polymerase bound with a transcription inhibitor protein.Nature. 2010; 468: 978-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), although neither the contribution of scaffold sequence nor the presence of an RNA hairpin in the crystallized EC were explicitly tested. As Tagami et al., 2010Tagami S. Sekine S. Kumarevel T. Hino N. Murayama Y. Kamegamori S. Yamamoto M. Sakamoto K. Yokoyama S. Crystal structure of bacterial RNA polymerase bound with a transcription inhibitor protein.Nature. 2010; 468: 978-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar point out, Gfh1 binding to the EC could not occur in the canonical closed-clamp EC conformation and requires the widened secondary channel of the open-clamp conformation, suggesting that Gfh1 binding likely stabilized the open-clamp conformation observed in the crystal. Moreover, our finding that Tth RNAP purified by standard procedures contains trace amounts of contaminating RNase that can degrade the RNA hairpin during crystallization trials suggests an explanation for the lack of hairpin electron density in the Tagami et al., 2010Tagami S. Sekine S. Kumarevel T. Hino N. Murayama Y. Kamegamori S. Yamamoto M. Sakamoto K. Yokoyama S. Crystal structure of bacterial RNA polymerase bound with a transcription inhibitor protein.Nature. 2010; 468: 978-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar structures because the presence of the hairpin was not confirmed biochemically. In the canonical ECs, the clamp is closed and exerts a tight grip on the downstream DNA duplex (Figure 3C). In contrast, in the ePEC, because of the open clamp, most of these contacts are broken (Figures"
https://openalex.org/W2167301468,"Background Google Flu Trends was developed to estimate influenza activity in many countries; however there is currently no Google Flu Trends or other Internet search data used for influenza surveillance in China. Methods and Findings Influenza surveillance data from 2008 through 2011 were obtained from provincial CDC influenza-like illness and virological surveillance systems of Guangdong, a province in south China. Internet search data were downloaded from the website of Google Trends. Pearson's correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare surveillance data and internet search trends. The correlation between CDC ILI surveillance and CDC virus surveillance was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.66). The strongest correlation was between the Google Trends term of Fever and ILI surveillance with a correlation coefficient of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.79). When compared with influenza virological surveillance, the Google Trends term of Influenza A had the strongest correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.79) in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic period. Conclusions This study shows that Google Trends in Chinese can be used as a complementary source of data for influenza surveillance in south China. More research in the future should develop new models using search trends in Chinese language to estimate local disease activity and detect early signals of outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2141231804,"In peripheral tissues circadian gene expression can be driven either by local oscillators or by cyclic systemic cues controlled by the master clock in the brain’s suprachiasmatic nucleus. In the latter case, systemic signals can activate immediate early transcription factors (IETFs) and thereby control rhythmic transcription. In order to identify IETFs induced by diurnal blood-borne signals, we developed an unbiased experimental strategy, dubbed Synthetic TAndem Repeat PROMoter (STAR-PROM) screening. This technique relies on the observation that most transcription factor binding sites exist at a relatively high frequency in random DNA sequences. Using STAR-PROM we identified serum response factor (SRF) as an IETF responding to oscillating signaling proteins present in human and rodent sera. Our data suggest that in mouse liver SRF is regulated via dramatic diurnal changes of actin dynamics, leading to the rhythmic translocation of the SRF coactivator Myocardin-related transcription factor-B (MRTF-B) into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2022056231,"Tannins, plant-derived polyphenols and other related compounds, have been utilized for a long time in many fields such as the food industry and manufacturing. In this study, we investigated the anti-viral effects of tannins on 12 different viruses including both enveloped viruses (influenza virus H3N2, H5N3, herpes simplex virus-1, vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendai virus and Newcastle disease virus) and non-enveloped viruses (poliovirus, coxsachievirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, feline calicivirus and mouse norovirus). We found that extracts from persimmon (Diospyros kaki), which contains ca. 22% of persimmon tannin, reduced viral infectivity in more than 4-log scale against all of the viruses tested, showing strong anti-viral effects against a broad range of viruses. Other tannins derived from green tea, acacia and gallnuts were effective for some of the viruses, while the coffee extracts were not effective for any of the virus. We then investigated the mechanism of the anti-viral effects of persimmon extracts by using mainly influenza virus. Persimmon extracts were effective within 30 seconds at a concentration of 0.25% and inhibited attachment of the virus to cells. Pretreatment of cells with the persimmon extracts before virus infection or post-treatment after virus infection did not inhibit virus replication. Protein aggregation seems to be a fundamental mechanism underlying the anti-viral effect of persimmon tannin, since viral proteins formed aggregates when purified virions were treated with the persimmon extracts and since the anti-viral effect was competitively inhibited by a non-specific protein, bovine serum albumin. Considering that persimmon tannin is a food supplement, it has a potential to be utilized as a safe and highly effective anti-viral reagent against pathogenic viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2088749580,"Few studies have investigated the presence of shift work disorder (SWD) in the general community. We addressed many of the limitations in this literature and present new findings. SWD has been treated as an ‘all or none’ construct but we propose the need to consider the ‘severity’ of the disorder. Using random digit dialling, we randomly recruited 1163 participants. Participants completed an extensive battery of scales and questions concerning work, health and individual differences. Three questions based on the criteria from the International Classification for Sleep Disorders were used to categorise participants with SWD (n = 176). In addition, we asked participants whether SWD interfered with aspects of their life and high ratings were used to define severe shift work disorder (SSWD). The prevalence of SWD was 32.1% among night workers and 10.1% in day workers (p<.001). SSWD was present in 9.1% of night workers and 1.3% of day workers (p<.001). Adjusted logistic regression analyses found significant associations between SWD and night work (OR = 3.35, CI 2.19-5.12), weekly work hours (OR = 1.02, CI 1.00–1.04), short sleep (≤6 h; OR = 2.93, CI 1.94–4.41), languidity (OR = 1.11, CI 1.06–1.16) and resilience (OR = 0.56, CI 0.43–0.81). Night work, short sleep, languidity, and hypertension were significantly associated with SSWD. Overall, participants with SSWD slept 0.80 h less than other participants (p<.001). Night work, short sleep and languidity were associated with both SWD and SSWD. Day workers with SWD symptoms reported significantly shorter sleep duration, higher levels of languidity and worked longer working hours compared to day workers without SWD."
https://openalex.org/W2129912253,"Whether olfaction recognizes odorants by their shape, their molecular vibrations, or both remains an open and controversial question. A convenient way to address it is to test for odor character differences between deuterated and undeuterated odorant isotopomers, since these have identical ground-state conformations but different vibrational modes. In a previous paper (Franco et al. (2011) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108:9, 3797-802) we showed that fruit flies can recognize the presence of deuterium in odorants by a vibrational mechanism. Here we address the question of whether humans too can distinguish deuterated and undeuterated odorants. A previous report (Keller and Vosshall (2004) Nat Neurosci 7:4, 337-8) indicated that naive subjects are incapable of distinguishing acetophenone and d-8 acetophenone. Here we confirm and extend those results to trained subjects and gas-chromatography [GC]-pure odorants. However, we also show that subjects easily distinguish deuterated and undeuterated musk odorants purified to GC-pure standard. These results are consistent with a vibrational component in human olfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2051409637,"Treatment of glioblastoma is complicated by the tumors' high resistance to chemotherapy, poor penetration of drugs across the blood brain barrier, and damaging effects of chemotherapy and radiation to normal neural tissue. To overcome these limitations, a thermally responsive polypeptide was developed for targeted delivery of therapeutic peptides to brain tumors using focused hyperthermia. The peptide carrier is based on elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), which is a thermally responsive biopolymer that forms aggregates above a characteristic transition temperature. ELP was modified with cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) to enhance delivery to brain tumors and mediate uptake across the tumor cells' plasma membranes and with a peptide inhibitor of c-Myc (H1). In rats with intracerebral gliomas, brain tumor targeting of ELP following systemic administration was enhanced up to 5-fold by the use of CPPs. When the lead CPP-ELP-fused c-Myc inhibitor was combined with focused hyperthermia of the tumors, an additional 3 fold increase in tumor polypeptide levels was observed, and 80% reduction in tumor volume, delayed onset of tumor-associated neurological deficits, and at least doubled median survival time including complete regression in 80% of animals was achieved. This work demonstrates that a c-Myc inhibitory peptide can be effectively delivered to brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1970401038,"Natural killer (NK) cell malignancies, particularly aggressive NK cell leukaemias and lymphomas, have poor prognoses. Although recent regimens with L-asparaginase substantially improved outcomes, novel therapeutic approaches are still needed to enhance clinical response. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective and anti-cancer activities. In this study, we investigated the potential anti-tumour activities of resveratrol against the NK cell lines KHYG-1, NKL, NK-92 and NK-YS. Resveratrol induced robust G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, significantly suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner for all four cell lines. In addition, resveratrol suppressed constitutively active STAT3 in all the cell lines and inhibited JAK2 phosphorylation but had no effect on other upstream mediators of STAT3 activation, such as PTEN, TYK2, and JAK1. Resveratrol also induced downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins MCL1 and survivin, two downstream effectors of the STAT3 pathway. Finally, resveratrol induced synergistic effect on the apoptotic and antiproliferative activities of L-asparaginase against KHYG-1, NKL and NK-92 cells. These results suggest that resveratrol may have therapeutic potential against NK cell malignancies. Furthermore, our finding that resveratrol is a bonafide JAK2 inhibitor extends its potential benefits to other diseases with dysregulated JAK2 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2018805924,"The timing of referral to a nephrologist may influence the outcome of chronic kidney disease patients, but its impact has not been evaluated thoroughly. The results of a recent study showing an association between early referral and patient survival are still being debated. A total of 1028 patients newly diagnosed as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from July 2008 to October 2011 were enrolled. Early referral (ER) was defined as patients meeting with a nephrologist more than a year before dialysis and dialysis education were provided, and all others were considered late referral (LR). The relationship of referral pattern with mortality in ESRD patients was explored using a Cox proportional hazards regression models. Time from referral to dialysis was significantly longer in 599 ER patients than in 429 LR patients (62.3±58.9 versus 2.9±3.4 months, P<0.001). Emergency HD using a temporary vascular catheter was required in 485 (47.2%) out of all patients and in 262 (43.7%) of ER compared with 223 (52.0%) of LR (P = 0.009). After 2 years of follow-up, the survival rate in ER was better than that in LR (hazard ratio [HR] 2.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27–4.45, P = 0.007). In patients with diabetes nephropathy, patient survival was also significantly higher in ER than in LR (HR 4.74, 95% CI 1.73–13.00, P = 0.002). With increasing age, HR also increased. Timely referral to a nephrologist in the predialytic stage is associated with reduced mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2031495730,"Susceptibility of Tribolium castaneum (Tc) larvae was determined against spore-crystal mixtures of five coleopteran specific and one lepidopteran specific Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxin producing strains and those containing the structurally unrelated Cry3Ba and Cry23Aa/Cry37Aa proteins were found toxic (LC50 values 13.53 and 6.30 µg spore-crystal mixture/µL flour disc, respectively). Using iTRAQ combined with LC-MS/MS allowed the discovery of seven novel differentially expressed proteins in early response of Tc larvae to the two active spore-crystal mixtures. Proteins showing a statistically significant change in treated larvae compared to non-intoxicated larvae fell into two major categories; up-regulated proteins were involved in host defense (odorant binding protein C12, apolipophorin-III and chemosensory protein 18) and down-regulated proteins were linked to metabolic pathways affecting larval metabolism and development (pyruvate dehydrogenase Eα subunit, cuticular protein, ribosomal protein L13a and apolipoprotein LI-II). Among increased proteins, Odorant binding protein C12 showed the highest change, 4-fold increase in both toxin treatments. The protein displayed amino acid sequence and structural homology to Tenebrio molitor 12 kDa hemolymph protein b precursor, a non-olfactory odorant binding protein. Analysis of mRNA expression and mortality assays in Odorant binding protein C12 silenced larvae were consistent with a general immune defense function of non-olfactory odorant binding proteins. Regarding down-regulated proteins, at the transcriptional level, pyruvate dehydrogenase and cuticular genes were decreased in Tc larvae exposed to the Cry3Ba producing strain compared to the Cry23Aa/Cry37Aa producing strain, which may contribute to the developmental arrest that we observed with larvae fed the Cry3Ba producing strain. Results demonstrated a distinct host transcriptional regulation depending upon the Cry toxin treatment. Knowledge on how insects respond to Bt intoxication will allow designing more effective management strategies for pest control."
https://openalex.org/W2090372963,"Objective Previous studies on the association between migraine and the risk of developing hemorrhagic stroke (HS) have generated inconsistent results. The aim of the present population-based, age- and sex- matched follow-up study was to investigate whether migraine is associated with an increased risk of HS. Method A total of 20925 persons with at least two ambulatory visits in 2001 with the principal diagnosis of migraine were enrolled in the migraine group. The non-migraine group consisted of 104625, age- and sex- matched, randomly sampled subjects without migraine. The two-year HS-free survival rates for these 2 groups were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the effect of migraine on the occurrence of HS. Results During the 2 year follow-up, 113 subjects in the migraine group (0.54%) and 255 in the non-migraine group (0.24%) developed HS. The crude hazard ratio (HR) for developing HS in the migraine group was 2.22 compared to the non-migraine group (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.78–2.77, p<0.0001) and the adjusted HR was 2.13 (95% CI: 1.71–2.67, p<0.0001) after controlling for demographic characteristics and comorbid medical disorders. Conclusions This population-based age- and sex- matched cohort study shows that migraine was linked to an increased risk of HS."
https://openalex.org/W2000066939,"Novel classes of pain-relieving molecules are needed to fill the void between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and narcotics. We have recently shown that intraplantar administration of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in rats causes peripheral sensitization and hyperalgesia through the S1P(1) receptor subtype (S1PR(1)): the mechanism(s) involved are largely unknown and were thus explored in the present study. Intraplantar injection of carrageenan in rats led to a time-dependent development of thermal hyperalgesia that was associated with pronounced edema and infiltration of neutrophils in paw tissues. Inhibition of 1) S1P formation with SK-I, a sphingosine kinase inhibitor, 2) S1P bioavailability with the S1P blocking antibody Sphingomab, LT1002 (but not its negative control, LT1017) or 3) S1P actions through S1PR(1) with the selective S1PR(1) antagonist, W146 (but not its inactive enantiomer, W140) blocked thermal hyperalgesia and infiltration of neutrophils. Taken together, these findings identify S1P as an important contributor to inflammatory pain acting through S1PR(1) to elicit hyperalgesia in a neutrophil-dependant manner. In addition and in further support, we demonstrate that the development of thermal hyperalgesia following intraplantar injection of S1P or SEW2871 (an S1PR(1) agonist) was also associated with neutrophilic infiltration in paw tissues as these events were attenuated by fucoidan, an inhibitor of neutrophilic infiltration. Importantly, FTY720, an FDA-approved S1P receptor modulator known to block S1P-S1PR(1) signaling, attenuated carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia and associated neutrophil infiltration. Targeting the S1P/S1PR(1) axis opens a therapeutic strategy for the development of novel non-narcotic anti-hyperalgesic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2104581942,"Like many metazoans, the freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii begins its post-embryonic life with a set of morphologically distinct planktonic larval stages, followed by a benthic post-larval stage during which the maturing organism differs from the larvae both ecologically and physiologically. Understanding of the molecular basis underlying morphogenesis in crustaceans is limited to the observation that methyl farnesoate, the non-epoxidated form of the insect juvenile hormone, acts as the active crustacean juvenoid. Molt steroids were also linked to morphogenesis and several other molecular pathways, such as Hedgehog and Wnt, are known to underlie morphogenesis in all metazoans examined and, as such, are thought to do the same in crustaceans. Using next generation sequencing, we deep-sequenced the transcriptomes of several larval and post-larval stages. De novo assembly, followed by bioinformatics analysis, revealed that many novel transcripts are over-expressed in either larvae- or post-larvae-stage prawn, shedding light on the molecular basis underlying M. rosenbergii metamorphosis. Fast larval molting rates and periodic morphological changes were reflected in over-expression of transcripts annotated to the cell cycle, DNA replication and morphogenic pathways (i.e., Hedgehog and Wnt). Further characterization of transcripts assigned to morphogenic pathways by real-time RT-PCR reconfirmed their over-expression in larvae, albeit with a more complex expression pattern when examined in the individual developmental stages. The expression level of an orthologue of cytochrome P450, 15A1, known to epoxidize methyl farnesoate in insects, was increased in the late larval and early post-larval stages, in accordance with the role of methyl farnesoate in crustacean metamorphosis. This study exemplifies the applicability of a high-throughput sequencing approach for studying complex traits, including metamorphosis, providing new insight into this unexplored area of crustacean research."

The chimeric virus displayed growth kinetics similar to those of O/CHA/99 and was selected for use as a candidate vaccine strain after 12 passages in BHK cells. Cattle were vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine and humoral immune responses were induced in most of the animals on day 7. A challenge infection with A/WH/CHA/09 on day 28 indicated that the group given a 4-µg dose was fully protected and neither developed viremia nor seroconverted to a 3ABC antigen.Our data demonstrate that the chimeric virus not only propagates well in BHK cells and has excellent antigenic matching against serotype A FMD, but is also a potential marker vaccine to distinguish infection from vaccination. These results suggest that reverse genetics technology is a useful tool for engineering vaccines for the prevention and control of FMD."

However, few studies have investigated the effect of potassium intake on metabolic syndrome (MetS). Data was taken from the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (2008-2010) using weighted adjustment. MetS was defined as per the revised National Cholesterol Education Program criteria. Homeostasis model assessment indices were calculated to diagnosis insulin resistance (IR). A total of 16,637 participants (44 ± 0.25 years) were included. Women ingested lower amounts of potassium (2.71 ± 0.02 g/day) than men (3.45 ± 0.03 g/day). A curvilinear association between potassium intake and MetS prevalence was found among women. Women with less than the Adequate Intake (4.7 g/day) of potassium had an 11% risk reduction for MetS (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.96; P = 0.004) and a 10% risk reduction for IR (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99; P = 0.026) for every 1 g/day potassium increase. Compared with the reference group (3.5-4.5 g/day), potassium intake was inversely associated with an increased risk of MetS (1.5-2.5 g/day; OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.02-1.63; P = 0.035; <1.5 g/day; OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.06-1.85; P = 0.017) and IR (<1.5 g/day; OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05-1.76; P = 0.021). This relationship was more prominent in postmenopausal women, but not observed among men. Higher potassium intake is significantly associated with a lower MetS prevalence in women, and IR is believed to be connected."
https://openalex.org/W2020705682,"In order to effectively understand and cope with the current 'biodiversity crisis', having large-enough sets of qualified data is necessary. Information facilitators such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) are ensuring increasing availability of primary biodiversity records by linking data collections spread over several institutions that have agreed to publish their data in a common access schema. We have assessed the primary records that one such publisher, the Spanish node of GBIF (GBIF.ES), hosts on behalf of a number of institutions, considered to be a highly representative sample of the total mass of available data for a country in order to know the quantity and quality of the information made available. Our results may provide an indication of the overall fitness-for-use in these data. We have found a number of patterns in the availability and accrual of data that seem to arise naturally from the digitization processes. Knowing these patterns and features may help deciding when and how these data can be used. Broadly, the error level seems low. The available data may be of capital importance for the development of biodiversity research, both locally and globally. However, wide swaths of records lack data elements such as georeferencing or taxonomical levels. Although the remaining information is ample and fit for many uses, improving the completeness of the records would likely increase the usability span for these data."
https://openalex.org/W2133941942,"Multiple system atrophy is a parkinsonian neurodegenerative disorder. It is cytopathologically characterized by accumulation of the protein p25α in cell bodies of oligodendrocytes followed by accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein in so-called glial cytoplasmic inclusions. p25α is a stimulator of α-synuclein aggregation, and coexpression of α-synuclein and p25α in the oligodendroglial OLN-t40-AS cell line causes α-synuclein aggregate-dependent toxicity. In this study, we investigated whether the FAS system is involved in α-synuclein aggregate dependent degeneration in oligodendrocytes and may play a role in multiple system atrophy. Using rat oligodendroglial OLN-t40-AS cells we demonstrate that the cytotoxicity caused by coexpressing α-synuclein and p25α relies on stimulation of the death domain receptor FAS and caspase-8 activation. Using primary oligodendrocytes derived from PLP-α-synuclein transgenic mice we demonstrate that they exist in a sensitized state expressing pro-apoptotic FAS receptor, which makes them sensitive to FAS ligand-mediated apoptosis. Immunoblot analysis shows an increase in FAS in brain extracts from multiple system atrophy cases. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated enhanced FAS expression in multiple system atrophy brains notably in oligodendrocytes harboring the earliest stages of glial cytoplasmic inclusion formation. Oligodendroglial FAS expression is an early hallmark of oligodendroglial pathology in multiple system atrophy that mechanistically may be coupled to α-synuclein dependent degeneration and thus represent a potential target for protective intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2061852728,"HPV account for most of the incidence of cervical cancer. Approximately 90% of anal cancers and a smaller subset (<50%) of other cancers (oropharyngeal, penile, vaginal, vulvar) are also attributed to HPV. The L1 protein comprising HPV vaccine formulations elicits high-titre neutralizing antibodies and confers type restricted protection. The L2 protein is a promising candidate for a broadly protective HPV vaccine. In our previous study, we found the most prevalent high-risk HPV infectious serotypes were HPV-16 and HPV-58 among women of Southwest China. To explore gene polymorphisms and intratypic variations of HPV-16 and HPV-58 L1/L2 genes originating in Southwest China, HPV-16 (L1: n = 31, L2: n = 28) and HPV-58 (L1: n = 21, L2: n = 21) L1/L2 genes were sequenced and compared to others described and submitted to GenBank. Phylogenetic trees were then constructed by Neighbor-Joining and the Kimura 2-parameters methods (MEGA software), followed by an analysis of the diversity of secondary structure. Then selection pressures acting on the L1/L2 genes were estimated by PAML software. Twenty-nine single nucleotide changes were observed in HPV-16 L1 sequences with 16/29 non-synonymous mutations and 13/29 synonymous mutations (six in alpha helix and two in beta turns). Seventeen single nucleotide changes were observed in HPV-16 L2 sequences with 8/17 non-synonymous mutations (one in beta turn) and 9/17 synonymous mutations. Twenty-four single nucleotide changes were observed in HPV-58 L1 sequences with 10/24 non-synonymous mutations and 14/24 synonymous mutations (eight in alpha helix and four in beta turn). Seven single nucleotide changes were observed in HPV-58 L2 sequences with 4/7 non-synonymous mutations and 3/7 synonymous mutations. The result of selective pressure analysis showed that most of these mutations were of positive selection. This study may help understand the intrinsic geographical relatedness and biological differences of HPV-16/HPV-58 and contributes further to research on their infectivity, pathogenicity, and vaccine strategy."
https://openalex.org/W1994222909,"Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are soluble proteins, whose role in olfaction of insects is being recognized as more and more important. We have cloned, expressed and purified an OBP (HarmOBP7) from the antennae of the moth Helicoverpa armigera. Western blot experiments indicate specific expression of this protein in the antennae of adults. HarmOBP7 binds both pheromone components Z-11-hexadecenal and Z-9-hexadecenal with good affinity. We have also performed a series of binding experiments with linear aldehydes, alcohols and esters, as well as with other compounds and found a requirement of medium size for best affinity. The affinity of OBP7, as well as that of a mutant lacking the last 6 residues does not substantially decrease in acidic conditions, but increases at basic pH values with no significant differences between wild-type and mutant. Binding to both pheromone components, instead, is negatively affected by the lack of the C-terminus. A second mutant, where one of the three lysine residues in the C-terminus (Lys123) was replaced by methionine showed reduced affinity to both pheromone components, as well as to their analogues, thus indicating that Lys123 is involved in binding these compounds, likely forming hydrogen bonds with the functional groups of the ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2001287643,"Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has a severe prognosis due to hepatic inflammatory injury. The cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22) is reported to exert anti-apoptotic and proliferative effects, but IL-22 has not been studied during the course of AH. IL-22 is mainly produced by CD4(+) (helper) T cells, including Th17 cells. In addition, Th17 cells produce the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A, which has been implicated in AH.We aimed to study the levels of circulating IL-22- and IL-17A-producing T helper cells and plasma cytokines in patients with AH and to examine the observations in relation to the short-term disease course.We collected blood samples from 21 consecutive patients with severe AH on days 0, 14 and 30 after diagnosis, and included 10 stable alcoholic cirrhosis patients and 10 healthy subjects as controls. Analyses were performed using flow cytometry and ELISA.We found higher frequencies of IL-22-producing T helper cells in AH patients (median 1.7%) than in cirrhosis patients (1.0%, p = 0.03) and healthy controls (1.0%, p = 0.01), and a 1.5-fold increase in the plasma concentration of IL-17A in AH compared with healthy controls (p<0.01). Those patients who markedly improved their Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score demonstrated a 2-fold higher frequency of IL-22-producing T helper cells at baseline and during follow-up than patients whose condition deteriorated (p = 0.04).The frequency of IL-22-producing T helper cells was increased in AH patients and most so in those whose condition seemed to improve. T cell differentiation toward an IL-22-producing phenotype may thus be favourable in AH."
https://openalex.org/W2002547691,"The passage of leukocytes across the endothelium and into arterial walls is a critical step in the development of atherosclerosis. Previously, we showed in vitro that the RhoG guanine nucleotide exchange factor SGEF (Arhgef26) contributes to the formation of ICAM-1-induced endothelial docking structures that facilitate leukocyte transendothelial migration. To further explore the in vivo role of this protein during inflammation, we generated SGEF-deficient mice. When crossed with ApoE null mice and fed a Western diet, mice lacking SGEF showed a significant decrease in the formation of atherosclerosis in multiple aortic areas. A fluorescent biosensor revealed local activation of RhoG around bead-clustered ICAM-1 in mouse aortic endothelial cells. Notably, this activation was decreased in cells from SGEF-deficient aortas compared to wild type. In addition, scanning electron microscopy of intimal surfaces of SGEF−/− mouse aortas revealed reduced docking structures around beads that were coated with ICAM-1 antibody. Similarly, under conditions of flow, these beads adhered less stably to the luminal surface of carotid arteries from SGEF−/− mice. Taken together, these results show for the first time that a Rho-GEF, namely SGEF, contributes to the formation of atherosclerosis by promoting endothelial docking structures and thereby retention of leukocytes at athero-prone sites of inflammation experiencing high shear flow. SGEF may therefore provide a novel therapeutic target for inhibiting the development of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2051674645,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators in eukaryotes that target mRNAs repressing their expression. The uncertain process of pig domestication, with different origin focuses, and the selection process that commercial breeds suffered, have generated a wide spectrum of breeds with clear genetic and phenotypic variability. The aim of this work was to define the miRNAs expression profile in kidney of several porcine breeds. Small RNA libraries from kidney were elaborated and high-throughput sequenced with the 454 Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche). Pigs used were classified into three groups: the European origin group (Iberian breed and European Wild Boar ancestor), European commercial breeds (Landrace, Large White and Piétrain breeds) and breeds with Asian origin (Meishan and Vietnamese breeds). A total of 229 miRNAs were described in the pig kidney miRNA profile, including 110 miRNAs out of the 257 previously described pig miRNAs and 119 orthologous miRNAs. The most expressed miRNAs in pig kidney microRNAome were Hsa-miR-200b-3p, Ssc-miR-125b and Ssc-miR-23b. Moreover, 5 novel porcine miRNAs and 3 orthologous miRNAs could be validated through RT-qPCR. miRNA sequence variation was determined in 116 miRNAs, evidencing the presence of isomiRs. 125 miRNAs were differentially expressed between breed groups. The identification of breed-specific miRNAs, which could be potentially associated to certain phenotypes, is becoming a new tool for the study of the genetic variability underlying complex traits and furthermore, it adds a new layer of complexity to the interesting process of pig evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2084815510,"The etiology of granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) is largely unknown. The primary mode of treatment is surgical, however not all women are cured by surgery alone. Thus, it is important to develop improved treatments through a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to this disease. Recently, it has been shown that a FOXL2 402C>G (C134W) mutation is present in 97% of human adult-type GCTs, suggesting an important role for this mutation in the development of GCTs. We have shown previously that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-I and -II induce apoptosis in cultured normal human granulosa cells. Moreover, it has been reported that FOXL2 can bind to the promoter of the mouse GnRH receptor gene and regulate its transcription. Thus, we hypothesized that C134W mutant FOXL2 could modulate the pro-apoptotic effects of GnRH via aberrant regulation of GnRH receptor levels. Using KGN cells, a human GCT-derived cell line which harbors the FOXL2 402C>G mutation, we show that treatment with GnRH-I and -II induces cell apoptosis, and that small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of GnRH receptor abolishes these effects. Overexpression of wild-type FOXL2 increases both mRNA and protein levels of GnRH receptor and consequently enhances GnRH-induced apoptosis. Importantly, neither the expression levels of GnRH receptor nor GnRH-induced apoptosis were affected by overexpression of the C134W mutant FOXL2. Interestingly, knockdown of endogenous FOXL2 down-regulates GnRHR expression in normal human granulosa cells with wild-type FOXL2, but not in KGN cells. These results suggest that the FOXL2 402C>G mutation may contribute to the development of human adult-type GCTs by reducing the expression of GnRH receptor, thus conferring resistance to GnRH-induced cell apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1988697107,"Symbiotic ß-proteobacteria not only occur in root nodules of legumes but are also found in leaves of certain Rubiaceae. The discovery of bacteria in plants formerly not implicated in endosymbiosis suggests a wider occurrence of plant-microbe interactions. Several ß-proteobacteria of the genus Burkholderia are detected in close association with tropical plants. This interaction has occurred three times independently, which suggest a recent and open plant-bacteria association. The presence or absence of Burkholderia endophytes is consistent on genus level and therefore implies a predictive value for the discovery of bacteria. Only a single Burkholderia species is found in association with a given plant species. However, the endophyte species are promiscuous and can be found in association with several plant species. Most of the endophytes are part of the plant-associated beneficial and environmental group, but others are closely related to B. glathei. This soil bacteria, together with related nodulating and non-nodulating endophytes, is therefore transferred to a newly defined and larger PBE group within the genus Burkholderia."
https://openalex.org/W2007410027,"Vestimentiferan tubeworms are marine invertebrates that inhabit chemosynthetic environments, and although recent molecular phylogenetic analyses have suggested that vestimentiferan tubeworms are derived from polychaete annelids, they show some morphological features that are different from other polychaetes. For example, vestimentiferans lack a digestive tract and have less body segments and comparative neuroanatomy can provide essential insight into the vestimentiferan body plan and its evolution. In the present study, we investigated the adult nervous system in the vestimentiferan Lamellibrachia satsuma using antibodies against synapsin, serotonin, FMRMamide and acetylated α-tubulin. We also examined the expressions of neural marker genes, elav and synaptotagmin to reveal the distribution of neuronal cell bodies. Brain anatomy shows simple organization in Lamellibrachia compared to other polychaetes. This simplification is probably due to the loss of the digestive tract, passing through the body between the brain and the subesophageal ganglion. In contrast, the ventral nerve cord shows a repeated organizational structure as in the other polychaetes, despite the absence of the multiple segmentation of the trunk. These results suggest that the brain anatomy is variable depending on the function and the condition of surrounding tissues, and that the formation of the rope ladder-like nervous system of the ventral nerve cord is independent from segmentation in polychaetes."
https://openalex.org/W2038179210,"Breast cancer cell lines are widely used tools to investigate breast cancer biology and to develop new therapies. Breast cancer tissue contains molecularly heterogeneous cell populations. Thus, it is important to understand which cell lines best represent the primary tumor and have similarly diverse phenotype. Here, we describe the development of five breast cancer cell lines from a single patient's breast cancer tissue. We characterize the molecular profiles, tumorigenicity and metastatic ability in vivo of all five cell lines and compare their responsiveness to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment.Five breast cancer cell lines were derived from a single patient's primary breast cancer tissue. Expression of different antigens including HER2, estrogen receptor (ER), CK8/18, CD44 and CD24 was determined by flow cytometry, western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). In addition, a Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) assay for HER2 gene amplification and p53 genotyping was performed on all cell lines. A xenograft model in nude mice was utilized to assess the tumorigenic and metastatic abilities of the breast cancer cells.We have isolated, cloned and established five new breast cancer cell lines with different tumorigenicity and metastatic abilities from a single primary breast cancer. Although all the cell lines expressed low levels of ER, their growth was estrogen-independent and all had high-levels of expression of mutated non-functional p53. The HER2 gene was rearranged in all cell lines. Low doses of 4-OHT induced proliferation of these breast cancer cell lines.All five breast cancer cell lines have different antigenic expression profiles, tumorigenicity and organ specific metastatic abilities although they derive from a single tumor. None of the studied markers correlated with tumorigenic potential. These new cell lines could serve as a model for detailed genomic and proteomic analyses to identify mechanisms of organ-specific metastasis of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2000609560,"Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) employs a type III secretion system (TTSS) to export the translocator and effector proteins required for mucosal colonization. As an important bacterial effector protein in locus of enterocyte effacement four, the EspF protein causes F-actin filament aggregations to form attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions, and induces the destruction of brush-border microvilli and cytoskeletal rearrangements to form pedestals. However, the molecular pathogenesis of A/E lesions due to EHEC O157:H7 infection is unclear. In this study, we constructed an espF-deficient mutant (ΔespF) with a 162-bp deletion in the N-terminal domain by using overlap extension PCR. The results showed that EHEC EspF translocated into intestinal epithelial cells, targeted mitochondria and induced apoptosis. The ΔespF mutant, compared to EHEC prototype Guangzhou strain, had lower cell attachment and effacement abilities, lower caspase-9/3 and lactate dehydrogenase levels, lower bacterial adhesion, weaker mitochondria apoptosis, and a higher mouse survival rate. Our results demonstrate the probable function of the EspF N-terminal domain, which targets mitochondria and binds mitochondria heat shock protein 70 to induce cell apoptosis via A/E lesions. These findings may be invaluable in clarifying the molecular pathogenesis of EspF of EHEC O157:H7."
https://openalex.org/W2002447695,"Unlike experimental studies indicating a neuroprotective property of uric acid, clinical studies have shown that elevated levels of uric acid are associated with a risk of ischemic stroke. However, the association of uric acid with cerebral hemorrhage has seldom been tested. We aimed to elucidate the association between uric acid and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), a hemorrhage-prone cerebral microangiopathy. Seven hundred twenty-four patients with ischemic stroke who were consecutively admitted to our hospital were included in this study. We collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, including uric acid level, and examined the presence of CMBs using T2*-weighted gradient-echo MRI. We used logistic regression analysis to examine an independent association between uric acid and CMBs. Two-hundred twenty-six patients had CMBs (31.2%). After adjusting for possible confounders, elevated uric acid was independently associated with the presence of CMBs (the highest quartile vs. lowest quartile, adjusted odd ratio [OR], 1.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-3.39). This association retained in patients with deep or infratentorial CMBs (with or without lobar CMBs) but not among those with lobar CMBs. In addition, this association was robust among patients with hypertension (the highest quartile vs. lowest quartile, adjusted OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.43-5.24). In contrast, we did not find the association in patients without hypertension. We demonstrated that serum uric acid is independently associated with the presence of CMBs. In particular, the relation between uric acid and CMBs was robust in hypertensive patients."
https://openalex.org/W2071959985,"Background The first line of defense by bacteria against β-lactam antibiotics is the expression of β-lactamases, which cleave the amide bond of the β-lactam ring. In the reaction of biapenem inactivation by B2 metallo β-lactamases (MβLs), after the β-lactam ring is opened, the carboxyl group generated by the hydrolytic process and the hydroxyethyl group (common to all carbapenems) rotate around the C5–C6 bond, assuming a new position that allows a proton transfer from the hydroxyethyl group to C2, and a nucleophilic attack on C3 by the oxygen atom of the same side-chain. This process leads to the formation of a bicyclic compound, as originally observed in the X-ray structure of the metallo β-lactamase CphA in complex with product. Methodology/Principal Findings QM/MM and metadynamics simulations of the post-hydrolysis steps in solution and in the enzyme reveal that while the rotation of the hydroxyethyl group can occur in solution or in the enzyme active site, formation of the bicyclic compound occurs primarily in solution, after which the final product binds back to the enzyme. The calculations also suggest that the rotation and cyclization steps can occur at a rate comparable to that observed experimentally for the enzymatic inactivation of biapenem only if the hydrolysis reaction leaves the N4 nitrogen of the β-lactam ring unprotonated. Conclusions/Significance The calculations support the existence of a common mechanism (in which ionized N4 is the leaving group) for carbapenems hydrolysis in all MβLs, and suggest a possible revision of mechanisms for B2 MβLs in which the cleavage of the β-lactam ring is associated with or immediately followed by protonation of N4. The study also indicates that the bicyclic derivative of biapenem has significant affinity for B2 MβLs, and that it may be possible to obtain clinically effective inhibitors of these enzymes by modification of this lead compound."
https://openalex.org/W2028188803,"Dengue virus (DENV) is found in the tropical and subtropical regions and affects millions of people annually. Currently, no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against dengue virus is available. Innate immunity has been shown to be important for host resistance to DENV infection. Although protein kinase regulated by double-stranded RNA (PKR) has been found to promote the innate signaling in response to infection by several viruses, its role in the innate response to DENV infection is still unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the role of PKR in DENV-induced innate immune responses.By RNAi, silencing of PKR significantly enhanced the expression of interferon (IFN)-β in DENV infected human lung epithelial A549 cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy data showed that PKR knockdown upregulated the activation of innate signaling cascades including p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), interferon regulatory factor-3 and NF-κB, following DENV2 infection. Likewise, a negative regulatory effect of PKR on the IFN production was also observed in poly(IC) challenged cells. Moreover, the PKR knockdown-mediated IFN induction was attenuated by RIG-I or IPS-1 silencing. Finally, overexpression of a catalytically inactive PKR mutant (K296R), but not of a mutant lacking dsRNA binding activity (K64E) or the double mutant (K64EK296R), reversed the IFN induction mediated by PKR knockdown, suggesting that the dsRNA binding activity is required for PKR to downregulate IFN production.PKR acts as a negative regulator of IFN induction triggered by DENVs and poly(IC), and this regulation relies on its dsRNA binding activity. These findings reveal a novel regulatory role for PKR in innate immunity, suggesting that PKR might be a promising target for anti-DENV treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2131302195,"Background Antiretroviral treatment (ART) options for young children co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis are limited in resource-poor settings due to limited data on the use of efavirenz (EFV). Using available pharmacokinetic data, an EFV dosing schedule was developed for young co-infected children and implemented as the standard of care at Macha Hospital in Southern Province, Zambia. Treatment outcomes inchildren younger than 3 years of age or weighing less than 10 kg receiving either EFV-based ART plus anti-tuberculous treatment or nevirapine-based (NVP) ART were compared. Methods Treatment outcomes were measured in a cohort of HIV-infected children seeking care at Macha Hospital in rural Zambia from 2007 to 2010. Informationon the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis was abstracted from medical records. Results Forty-five children treated for tuberculosis initiated an EFV-based regimen and 69 children initiated a NVP-based regimen, 7 of whom also were treated for tuberculosis. Children receiving both regimens were comparable in age, but children receiving EFV started ART with a lower CD4+ T-cell percentage and weight-for-age z-score. Children receiving EFV experienced increases in both CD4+ T-cell percentage and weight-for-age z-score during follow-up, such that levels were comparable to children receiving NVP after two years of ART. Cumulative survival after 12 months of ART did not differ between groups (NVP:87%;EFV:80%;p = 0.25). Eleven children experienced virologic failure during follow-up.The adjusted hazard ratio of virologic failure comparing EFV to NVP was 0.25 (95% CI:0.05,1.24) and 0.13 (95% CI:0.03,0.62) using thresholds of 5000 and 400 copies/mL, respectively.Five children receiving EFV were reported to have had convulsions after ART initiation compared to only one child receiving NVP (p = 0.04). Conclusions Despite poorer health at ART initiation, children treated for tuberculosis and receiving EFV-based regimens showed significant improvements comparable to children receiving NVP-based regimens. EFV-based regimens should be considered for young HIV-infected children co-infected with tuberculosis in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W1964630701,"Given the ever-increasing human impact through land use and climate change on the environment, we crucially need to achieve a better understanding of those factors that influence the questing activity of ixodid ticks, a major disease-transmitting vector in temperate forests. We investigated variation in the relative questing nymph densities of Ixodes ricinus in differently managed forest types for three years (2008–2010) in SW Germany by drag sampling. We used a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach to examine the relative effects of habitat and weather and to consider possible nested structures of habitat and climate forces. The questing activity of nymphs was considerably larger in young forest successional stages of thicket compared with pole wood and timber stages. Questing nymph density increased markedly with milder winter temperatures. Generally, the relative strength of the various environmental forces on questing nymph density differed across years. In particular, winter temperature had a negative effect on tick activity across sites in 2008 in contrast to the overall effect of temperature across years. Our results suggest that forest management practices have important impacts on questing nymph density. Variable weather conditions, however, might override the effects of forest management practices on the fluctuations and dynamics of tick populations and activity over years, in particular, the preceding winter temperatures. Therefore, robust predictions and the detection of possible interactions and nested structures of habitat and climate forces can only be quantified through the collection of long-term data. Such data are particularly important with regard to future scenarios of forest management and climate warming."

In ongoing efforts to alleviate this crisis, the national government has placed great emphasis on efforts in Henan province where HIV-infected former plasma donors in the 1990s contributed to AIDS becoming a public health crisis. Concomitant with a national initiative focusing the use of phamacogenetics for the better prediction of treatment response, we studied genetic variants with known pharmacokinetic phenotypes in a set of 298 HAART-treated (highly active antiretroviral therapy) patients infected with HIV from the Henan cohort. We measured the association of response to treatment, assessed as changes in CD4+ T cell counts after antiretroviral therapy, of five polymorphisms in four genes (CYP2B6, ABCB1/MDR1, ABCG2, and ABCC4) in which variation has been suggested to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs commonly employed to treat HIV/AIDS. We show that genotyping for ABCB1 variations (rs1045642 and rs2032582) may help predict HIV treatment response. We found variations in this gene have a significant association with outcome as measured by CD4+ T cell counts in a discovery subset (N = 197; odds ratio (OR) = 1.58; 95% CI 1.02–2.45), these results were confirmed in a validation subset of the cohort (N = 78; OR = 2.81; 95% CI 1.32–5.96). Exploratory analysis suggests that this effect may be specific to NVP (nevirapine) or 3TC (lamivudine) response. This publication represents the first genetic analysis in a continuing effort to study and assist the patients in a very large, unique, and historically significant HIV-AIDS cohort. Genotyping of AIDS patients for ABCB1 variation may help predict outcome and potentially could help guide treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4234245034,"Background A general mechanism has been proposed for metallo β-lactamases (MβLs), in which deprotonation of a water molecule near the Zn ion(s) results in the formation of a hydroxide ion that attacks the carbonyl oxygen of the β-lactam ring. However, because of the absence of X-ray structures that show the exact position of the antibiotic in the reactant state (RS) it has been difficult to obtain a definitive validation of this mechanism. Methodology/Principal Findings We have employed a strategy to identify the RS, which does not rely on substrate docking and/or molecular dynamics. Starting from the X-ray structure of the enzyme:product complex (the product state, PS), a QM/MM scan was used to drive the reaction uphill from product back to reactant. Since in this process also the enzyme changes from PS to RS, we actually generate the enzyme:substrate complex from product and avoid the uncertainties associated with models of the reactant state. We used this strategy to study the reaction of biapenem hydrolysis by B2 MβL CphA. QM/MM simulations were carried out under 14 different ionization states of the active site, in order to generate potential energy surfaces (PESs) corresponding to a variety of possible reaction paths. Conclusions/Significance The calculations support a model for biapenem hydrolysis by CphA, in which the nucleophile that attacks the β-lactam ring is not the water molecule located in proximity of the active site Zn, but a second water molecule, hydrogen bonded to the first one, which is used up in the reaction, and thus is not visible in the X-ray structure of the enzyme:product complex."
https://openalex.org/W1985075700,"Migratory bird populations are often limited by food during the non-breeding season. Correlative evidence suggests that food abundance on territories varies among years in relation to rainfall, which affects plant productivity and arthropod biomass. At the Font Hill Nature Preserve in Jamaica, we used an irrigation experiment to test the hypothesis that rainfall affects the condition of wintering American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) via intermediate effects on plant productivity and arthropod abundance. Experimental plots were irrigated in late February and early March to simulate a mid-season pulse of 200 mm of rain. Irrigation maintained soil moisture levels near saturation and had immediate effects on plant productivity. Cumulative leaf abscission over the dry season was 50% lower on experimental plots resulting in greater canopy cover, and we observed significantly higher ground level shoot growth and the flushing of new leaves on about 58% of logwood (Haematoxylon campechianum) individuals. Arthropod biomass was 1.5 times higher on irrigated plots, but there was considerable inter-plot variability within a treatment and a strong seasonal decline in biomass. Consequently, we found no significant effect of irrigation on arthropod abundance or redstart condition. We suspect that the lack of an irrigation effect for taxa higher on the trophic chain was due to the small spatial scale of the treatment relative to the scale at which these taxa operate. Although redstart condition was not affected, we did observe turnover from subordinate to dominant territorial individuals on experimental plots suggesting a perceived difference in habitat quality that influenced individual behavior."

Adult African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) were fed a starch (SD) or fat (FD) diet and groups of fish were dissected at 2, 5 and 8 h after the consumption of a single meal. Chyme was collected quantitatively and was analysed for osmolality and dry matter (DM) content. Postprandial water fluxes were calculated, while using yttrium oxide (Y2O3) as an inert marker to account for the absorption of DM along the GIT. The largest differences in chyme characteristics between diets were observed in the stomach and decreased towards subsequent compartments. A high initial osmotic pressure was measured in the stomach for both diets (up to 498±2 mOsm kg−1) and was likely the driver for the endogeneous water influx to this compartment. Large additions of water were recorded to the stomach and proximal intestine for both diets and absorption of water took place in the mid- and distal intestine. Interestingly, the dietary treatment had an impact on water balance in the stomach and proximal intestine of the fish, but not in the mid- and distal intestine. A strong complementary relationship suggested that 59% of the water fluxes in the proximal intestine could be explained by previous additions to the stomach. Therefore, a higher dietary inclusion of starch led to a shift in water additions from the proximal intestine to the stomach. However, the sum of water additions to the GIT was not different between diets and was on average 6.52±0.85 ml water g−1 DM. The interactions between osmoregulation and digestion, in the GIT of fed freshwater fish, deserve further attention in future research."

The aim of this study is to explore the epidemiological and clinical features of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in United Nations personnel stationed in this area. From July 2006 to June 2009, epidemiological data and medical records of 678 patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria at the U.N. level 2 hospital were analyzed. The U.N. personnel were divided into individuals not immune to Plasmodium falciparum and individuals semi-immune to Plasmodium falciparum. The patients were divided into a chemoprophylaxis group (non-immune individuals who complied with the chemoprophylaxis regimen, 582 cases) and a no/incomplete chemoprophylaxis group (non-immune individuals who either did not fully comply with chemoprophylaxis or did not use it at all and semi-immune individuals who did not use chemoprophylaxis, 96 cases). Overall morbidity was about 11.3%. There was a significant difference in the morbidity of semi-immune and non-immune individuals (1.3% vs. 15.1%, P<0.001). Out of the total, 82.9% of cases occurred during the rainy season. The incidence of fever in the chemoprophylaxis group was significantly lower than in the no/incomplete chemoprophylaxis group (36.8% vs. 96.9%, P<0.001). Significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to all other malaria-like symptoms except gastrointestinal symptoms, serum glucose level, platelet count, and alanine aminotransferase level. The incidence of complications was 1.2% (chemoprophylaxis group) and 44.8% (no/incomplete chemoprophylaxis group).The most common complication was thrombocytopenia, which was seen in 40.6% of the no/incomplete chemoprophylaxis group. In summary, Plasmodium falciparum malaria mainly occurred in rainy season. Gastrointestinal symptoms are an important precursor of malaria. Blood smears and rapid diagnostic tests should be performed after the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. Appropriate chemoprophylaxis is necessary for reducing the severity of malaria."
