https://openalex.org/W2050238836,"Two improvements are described in the use of shadow electron micrography for the observation of particles of macromolecular dimensions. One involves the substitution of gold for chromium as shadowing metal. The thinner gold film that can be employed gives a truer representation of the shape of particles so small that shape and size are significantly altered by the thickness of the shadowing metal deposited on them. The other consists in metal-shadowing small particles deposited on a very smooth surface such as that of polished glass and the handling of this metal film as a replica of the glass surface and the particles resting on it. This technique permits the photography of particles whose direct observation is disturbed by the fine structure that is brought out by shadowing a collodion substrate. Application of these methods to the electron micrography of the tobacco mosaic virus protein shows that its fibrils are rods about 125A both in height and breadth. Though the rods appear segmented, these segments have not been found to have a length that is constant or a small integral multiple of an underlying unit."

The unit cell dimensions are a equal to 3.81 A, c equal to 3.48 A, and c/ a = 0.91. The melting curve of tin was observed up to 45 kb and the boundary line between the tin I and tin II phases was observed to 70 kb by x-ray diflraction techniques."
https://openalex.org/W1982634439,"The effect of pressure on the MÃ¶ssbauer spectrum of Fe(57) in iron metal has been studied as the pressure was increased presumably to more than 140 kbar. At pressures up to 120 kbar, a six-line spectrum characteristic of alpha-iron was observed. At 140 kbar, a seventh line appeared in the spectrum at -0.12 +/- 0.06 mm/sec relative to stainless steel. This line was attributed to the appearance of the high-pressure phase of iron."
https://openalex.org/W2035747217,"Recent measuremnents of the temperature of Venus suggest that a chemical interaction between the atmosphere and lithosphere may occur: the possible consequences of such interaction are examined. Results indicate that metallic iron, free carbon, and magnesium carbonates should not occur on the surface of Venus. Calcium carbonate, iron oxides and certain hydrous silicates may be present, but other hydrous silicates seem to be excluded. The effects of the physicochemical conditions on rock types and the various planetary processes are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1977694903,"Thioglycolic acid neutralized with sodium carbonate, sodium thioglycolate (Eastman), ethyl mercaptan, cysteine hydrochloride and certain sulfur-containing reducing agents (sodium bisulfite and sodium hydrosulfite) antagonize the antibacterial action of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone on Escherichia coli in a synthetic medium. Other reducing agents such as stannous chloride, potassium formate and sodium thiosulfate, show no such antagonism. The antibacterial activities of 2-methyl-3-chloro-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone are also abolished by excess thioglycolate and cysteine, while that of 2-methyl-3-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone with -OCH(3) instead of -Cl or -H in the 3 position on the quinone ring, is not. These findings suggest that the mode of antibacterial action of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone is by blocking essential enzymes through combination with sulfhydryl groups, or through combination with sulfhydryl groups of essential bacterial metabolites. This combination may take place in the 3-position on the quinone ring. This mode of action is similar to that suggested by other investigators for several antibiotic agents including penicillin. The antibacterial activity of the methoxy quinone, however, even in the presence of sulfhydryl groups, suggests that the foregoing explanation may not be the complete one."

This compound has been prepared by heating ClF(3) in the presence of fluorine at high pressure. Chlorine pentafluoride is a square pyramidal molecule. It has a lower melting point than ClF(3) and a higher vapor pressure. It is also less reactive than ClF(3)."

P., while a gastropod from elevation 22.5 m (75 ft) was older than 30,000 years B. P. A pelecypod from the island of Tierrabomba, near Cartagena, Colombia, at elevation 2.7 m ( 9 ft) gave a date of about 2850 years, while a pelecypod from Comodoro Rividavia, Argentina, at elevation 9 m ( 30 ft) gave a date of 5350 years B. P."
https://openalex.org/W2060778371,"Dilatometric measurements during the sol-gel-sol transition of an air-free, thixotropic, sodium bentonite suspension revealed a reversible change in volume of about 2.4 X 10(-4) percent. The volume of the suspension increased during gelation and decreased when the gel was subsequently liquified. This is taken as evidence of a progressive building up, during gelation, of a water structure less dense than normal."

https://openalex.org/W2089666677,"In freshly harvested Alaska-grown potato tubers there is a""rest period"" during which time no sprout growth can be visibly detected. This is followed by a physiological stage of development when sprout growth will occur in the dark but is suppressed by light. Following this is a stage of gradual resumption of growth of light-suppressed sprouts and a lessening of the inhibitory responses in tubers planted at successive lengthening periods of time after harvest."

https://openalex.org/W2016173781,Evidence for two polymorphic forms of isopropyl alcohol is presented. Three transformation reactions were observed. The transformation temperatures for pure isopropanol were 185.27(7) degrees K and 183.65(2) degrees K. The purity of the alcohol was found to be 99.98(5) percent ( calculated as moles).
